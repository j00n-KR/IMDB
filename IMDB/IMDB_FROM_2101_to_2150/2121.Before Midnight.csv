0,SnoopyStyle,The series keeps being great,8,20 May 2014,It's 9 years after 'Before Sunset' in the 3rd movie of the Before series. Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) are unmarried living in Paris with their twin daughters. Jesse has written 2 more books. It's one of the last days of their summer vacation in Greece. Jesse sees his son Hank off after spending the summer with him. Hank's mom is still angry and Jesse wants so much to spend more time with him in Chicago. Celine is thinking about taking a government job with complications.They are 41. They have kids. It has the naturalistic long takes very much in keeping with the previous movies. I love the sly humor and human scale of their lives. There is also something great about growing old with these characters. This is what comes after happily-ever-after of the second movie. I do like the scenes with Jesse and Celine alone more than the scenes with other people. I don't mind the other characters but I loved the private moments with just those two wandering around bullshitting. Also it's great to have them continue their relationship with their problems.,Before Midnight
1,claudio_carvalho,Marriage Crisis or Bipolar Disorder?,7,11 October 2013,"The writer Jesse Wallace (Ethan Hawke) is married with Céline (Julie Delpy) and they have twin daughters, Ella and Nina, eighteen years after their first encounter in a train in Vienna. They live in Paris but they are spending summer vacation in Greece in the house of Jesse's friends. In the end of the vacation, Jesse takes his fourteen year-old son Hank to the airport to fly to Chicago, where he lives with his mother. One of his Greek friends offers a hotel room for Jesse and Céline to spend one farewell dream night, but they discuss their relationship instead.""Before Midnight"" is the third chapter of the adorable saga of the French-American couple Céline and Jesse. Now they are mature and married with children, alternating good moments with crisis in their marriage like ""in real life and not a fairy tale"". The chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is very beautiful and intense and makes the movie worthwhile. Unfortunately, the plot is weak and hard to believe that a couple together for so many years has some attitude shown in the movie (for example, in the car returning from the airport). The unstable behavior of Céline, who hates her life and Jess success as a writer, seems to be of a woman with bipolar disorder and not caused by a marriage crisis. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Antes da Meia-Noite"" (""Before Midnight"")",Before Midnight
2,kosmasp,Is this the end?,8,12 August 2013,"Though it was never planned as such, we do get another installment on the ""Before ..."" series. But fans of the original movies are excited and rightfully so. Whether you watched this at a Festival (played in Berlin and other cities) or regularly, the crowd response to it was overwhelmingly good. There are reviewers here who write this might be the best of the series. Whatever the case is, the quality of all three movies is very high, which is very rare.You don't have to have seen the other movies, but it does make sense to get a feeling of our two lead characters. Of course they are meeting new people here (this time the location is Greece), but Problems and Passion are still there. The situations and the dialog feel more than real and while it might be too ""talky"" for some, others will rejoice and revel in it. Hopefully you know beforehand to which group you belong",Before Midnight
3,classicsoncall,"""I'm surprised we lasted this long.""",6,5 March 2018,"If there were an award category for most annoying film trilogy, my vote would go to the 'Before' series hands down. I thought that by the time Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) hit their Forties they would have matured into some semblance of a meaningful relationship, but their two hour banter between themselves and among friends on a vacation in Greece is downright excruciating. And once again, it's Celine who initiates excessive use of the 'F' word and gets in the gutter on topics ranging from her first boyfriend to Jesse's attempt to reconcile a relationship with a son from a first marriage. Jesse had it right when he squirmed over her 'can't win' question that went 'What about me would you change?'. Guys, if you want to answer correctly, you have to say 'Nothing' and stick with it no matter what. Otherwise you'll have to endure an hour of endless recrimination over everything that's occurred since the beginning of the relationship. Then again, if you answer 'Nothing', you'll be badgered into coming up with something that you'll regret in any case, and if you're not as creative as Jesse with an ability to think on your feet, you're cooked. It was with a great sense of relief when the final credits rolled because most everything I had to sit there and listen to was nailed by the Greek guy Stafanos (Panos Koronis) commenting on Jesse's idea for his next novel, and suitably describing the way I felt about this picture - ""Well, I don't know..., sounds pretentious"".",Before Midnight
4,gavin6942,The Long-Term Romance Part Three,7,30 June 2015,"We meet Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) nine years on in Greece. Almost two decades have passed since their first meeting on that train bound for Vienna.Although I have to say I like this installment less than the first two, it certainly has its place. I feel like the first two were more philosophical, and there was something about being set in earlier years that offered more appeal. We did not have mentions of using Skype (though, that is reality these days).But this was necessary, because we needed to know: will they survive, or will the relationship grow cold? We get many answers about the last several years of their lives... and yet, I have to wonder if Linklater is open to a part four (or five or six)?",Before Midnight
5,jboothmillard,Before Midnight,7,14 August 2015,"This is third entry by director Richard Linklater (Dazed and Confused, Waking Life, School of Rock, A Scanner Darkly, Boyhood) in the independent movie trilogy, which began with the fantastic Before Sunrise in 1995, followed by the not as good Before Sunset in 2004. Eighteen years since they first met in Vienna, and nine years since their reunion in Paris, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Céline (Golden Globe nominated Julie Delpy) are now a couple, unmarried and parents to twin girls, Jesse is a successful novelist, Céline is at a career crossroads, considering working for the French government. Jesse is struggling to maintain a relationship with his teenage son Hank (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick), he lives in Chicago with Jesse's ex-wife (he broke with her following his reunion with Céline), Hank spends the summer with his father on the Greek Peloponnese peninsula, before being dropped off at the airport to fly home. Jesse and Céline discuss their concerns about Hank, and then about Céline's choices for her career, over dinner with friends staying with them they talk more about life and love. Their friends pay for them to have a hotel room to spend the night alone, on the way Jesse and Céline reminisce about coming together, they remove clothing and consider sex, but then start a fierce argument, expressing fears about their present and future relationship. Among other issues, Jesse wants to move to Chicago to be closer to Hank, Céline does not like the idea of being far away from her family, in the heat of the moment Céline tells Jesse she no longer loves him and walks out. Céline sits alone in the hotel outdoor restaurant, Jesse soon joins her and uses a joke he used earlier, that he is a time traveller from the future, he says he has a letter from her elderly self, describing this night as one of the best of their lives. Céline is unamused and says their fantasies will never match the imperfect reality, Jesse explains his love for her, saying he does not know what else she could want, after a moment Céline plays along with Jesse's joke, and the two seem to reconcile their differences and reconnect. Also starring Jennifer Prior as Ella, Charlotte Prior as Nina, Xenia Kalogeropoulou as Natalia, Walter Lassally as Patrick, Ariane Labed as Anna, Yannis Papadopoulos as Achilleas and Athina Rachel Tsangari as Ariadni. Hawke and Delpy still have a great chemistry together, differences of opinion create tension, obviously their personal circumstances have changed as well to make things complicated, but they ultimately still love each other, there are a few other characters along the way as well, unlike the previous two films. This film relies entirely on the relationship of the lovers, played out in relaxed long takes with both everyday discussions and bickering, about love, sex, family, pain and politics, with intelligent banter, sharp humour and emotional truths, obviously it also relies on a well crafted script, it is a great end to a indie trilogy, a worthwhile romantic drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay. Very good!",Before Midnight
6,Quinoa1984,my film of the year - and many others I should hope,10,8 November 2014,"The return to Jesse and Celene (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, top of their respective talents) after another 9-year passage of time (Before Sunrise to Sunset was 9 years, now here's another). The difference this time is that the characters aren't falling in love, or re-discovering what made them initially attracted in the Brief Encounter sense. Now they're married, have two kids, and have the struggles of what married couples deal with (well, some of them anyway) , a kid from Hawke's previous marriage that he has to send off back to his home at the start of the film (they're in vacation in Greece, after all), and the conflict that this will pose, which is both somewhat minor AND great at the same time, if that makes sense.And just the, you know, what happens to a couple when they've been around each other for a long, LONG period of time. The love is still there, but the fire has to keep burning. At both ends. And is there love, is the question? Can these two stay connected? Who will win in an argument where it's more about being right than full-on logic? (which makes up the third act and boy-o-boy, watch out Ingmar Bergman for your title as King of the Marriage Dramas!) I loved this movie so dearly, for the time it takes giving us these characters anew, and how they speak like real people, like grown-ups! What a concept in modern cinema! The conversations here, including (breaking, in a great way, the tradition in 'Before' movies of it just being Jesse and Celene) new characters in this Greece setting talking about life, the universe and everything that matters – but especially love and relationships – are witty, engaging, not too high-concept but not dumbed down to any extreme.These three films, but especially this one which, like Woody Allen's 2013 entry Blue Jasmine, shows a maturer sensibility, some learned-ness about the state of being with a person, and being yourself around that person, and that there can be humor in the process. In fact the most pointed and spot-on message in the film I took away with, mostly with Hawke's performance and character, is that the ability to make your significant other laugh and be amused is really the key to it all (in a moment of desperation Jesse even says flat out, ""I'm trying to make you laugh!"") And that, too, is an asset as this is the funniest of the 'Before' series, particularly in that last bitter act where they hash it out in a hotel room. If you can't laugh, what's the point of it all?",Before Midnight
7,writers_reign,Beyond Great,10,21 June 2013,"Possibly like most people who both saw and loved the two previous films from the same writers-actors-director trio, Julie Delpy, Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater, I was partially resigned to the fact that three out of three is asking a lot. I was, I am delighted to say, hopelessly wrong. This is simply filmmaking at its best and totally against the run of cgi, s&v, gross-out comedy etc. Simply an adult film made by and for adults about that most hackneyed plot the Human Condition. It has to be one of the most economical films ever made as there can't be more than 20 shots throughout. So accomplished are the trio that they are able to shoot up to thirty minutes in one take witness the drive from the airport, the walk through the town, the hotel room, three marathon scenes kept afloat simply by conversation - if you wanted to be superficial you could say it was My Dinner With Andre with a mixed couple as opposed to two males. Delpy is still gorgeous despite making absolutely no effort; she wears two dresses throughout, neither a designer outfit, lets her hair fall where it may and generally looks like any typical forty-something mother of two except, of course that most forty-something mothers of two are not dropdead gorgeous. As most of the comments I've read here have noted if there is any justice (alas, no) this movie should walk away with Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Film. Oh, yes, I almost forgot; I liked it.",Before Midnight
8,grantss,Mixed feelings,6,11 November 2014,"Mixed feelings about this movie, the third of Richard Linklater's trilogy. The trilogy started in 1995 with Before Sunrise, continued in 2004 with Before Sunset and now, another nine years later, we have Before Midnight. The movies follow the lives and love of Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), with the span in years between movies reflecting the spans in their lives. We are getting snapshots of their lives, at nine-year intervals.Before Sunrise was OK, but not great. Really a dressed-up romantic drama, just with a more realistic and original plot and more subtle direction than your average romance movie.Before Sunset was the pick of the bunch. Rather than just a snapshot, it relates, through their dialogue, all the happenings in the last nine years of their lives, and demonstrates how much each of them were key in the other's life. It had more of a complete story and more character development.Before Midnight now picks up with them together, with their two kids, holidaying in Greece. Like the first two, it is very dialogue-intensive. Like the first two (especially Before Sunrise) the dialogue can be a big negative at times: pretentious, navel- gazing stuff.However, on the plus side, we get to see how relationships end up. Romantic dramas tend to end with the couple walking off into the sunset, very much in love, blissfully happy and without a care in the world. They never cover all the unromantic, even irritating, stuff that comes after it: kids, domestic life, mundanity. This does.On the downside, there is a reason this is never covered: it's boring, even annoying. Who wants to see a bitter, very protracted argument between husband and wife? Or people discussing domestic stuff? Thus, a two-edged sword.So, kudos to Richard Linklater for the concept of these movies and for not shying away from the less glamorous domestic years in a relationship. However, the domestic years aren't very entertaining to watch...",Before Midnight
9,george.schmidt,Third time is the charm in this ongoing romantic dramedy,9,25 May 2013,"BEFORE MIDNIGHT (2013) ***1/2 Third time is the charm in this ongoing romantic dramedy with American writer Ethan Hawke and Parisian lover Julie Delpy reexamining their relationship after reuniting nearly a decade ago focusing on their family, dreams and fears all at the same time while on a vacation in Greece (wonderfully lensed by Christos Voudouris). The logorrhea cum travelogue formula remains tried and true as filmmaker Richard Linklater and his stars (again the trio collaborating on the seemingly-on-the-fly-improvised screenplay) continue to navel-gaze, gripe, and ultimately rekindle a flickering flame of eternal love. A valentine for everyone who's ever fallen in love with questions, doubts and the usual baggage it retains.",Before Midnight
10,evanston_dad,"So Far the Best of the ""Before..."" Series",10,27 June 2013,"If there's a flaw in this simply beautiful film, I sure couldn't find it.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy return to play the characters they created in ""Before Sunrise"" and further explored in ""Before Sunset."" ""Before Midnight"" may just be the best of the three. Hawke and Delpy are now together, and struggling with the mundanity of raising children and actually living a life together, something that sounded much more romantic when fate and circumstances were keeping them apart. The acting is flawless, and so is the writing. The movie could so easily have become nothing more than two privileged white people moaning about their white person problems, but it instead gets right at the heart of what makes simple day-to-day living, even when nothing major is wrong with your life and even when you can admit that to yourself, so difficult.It doesn't hurt any that the film takes place amidst the gorgeous scenery of Greece.Oscar-winning cinematographer Walter Lasally (""Zorba the Greek"") makes a brief cameo as a wise old author and an actress named Xenia Kalogeropoulou stops the show with a soliloquy about the melancholy an old woman feels over the memories of her dead husband.Grade: A+",Before Midnight
11,anaconda-40658,Before Midnight Linklater Will Make a Cut.,7,29 April 2015,"Before Midnight (2013): Dir: Richard Linklater / Cast: Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy, Walter Lassally, Ariane Labed, Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick: Title is a reminder of the Biblical reference of not allowing the day to end with anger still brewing. This is the third in a trilogy that includes Before Sunrise and Before Sunset with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy still growing apart and together and back again. Set in a stunning Greek atmosphere and opens with Hawke's son boarding a plane back to Chicago where his mother lives. From there it could strike some viewers as unsettling when Richard Linklater shoots extremely long sequences consisting of conversation. There is a long driving sequences, another long dinner sequence, then a long walking sequence. Finally this all comes together at a hotel room where these two bicker. Some viewers will grow weary of Linklater's choice of shooting. Others will appreciate the skill of the two leads who hold it together within an extremely long one take. Structure is stagy but its message ring true for any couples who have been together for years. Hawke and Delpy hold it together with strong performances as a couple discussing their issues. He desires a closer relationship with his son and she resents the idea of moving to Chicago. She is also contemplating a Government job. Seamus Davey-Patrick plays Hawke's son who is seen in the film's opening scene at the airport. While Linklater has been more creative with other films this one sustains a theme many viewers will relate to when it comes to putting issues to rest before midnight. Score: 7 / 10",Before Midnight
12,zetes,Masterpiece,10,30 June 2013,"The original film in this series, Before Sunrise, was such a special, wonderful little film. When they made the unexpected sequel, Before Sunset, in 2004, there was such a depth to it - and an added depth to the original film - it was pretty much unprecedented. This third installment isn't as unexpected, I don't think, but it certainly doesn't disappoint. These films have become, as a whole, one of the greatest of all cinematic statements, one that truly understands how people work and the way history effects the future. This film finds Jesse and Celine, now together for the past decade, in Greece at the end of a summer vacation. Jesse is saying goodbye to the son he had with his ex-wife, and on the way back from the airport he thinks aloud that he could probably be a bigger part of his son's life if he lived back in the United States (the couple and their twin daughters reside in Paris usually). This begins an argument between the couple that eventually turns quite bitter. Through the course of the film, we learn everything that has happened in the intervening ten years. There's also a great scene, unlike the other two movies, where the couple converses with other people, all of whom have their own theories on love and life. As with the previous two installments, this is incredibly lovely. Both Hawke and Delpy are brilliant. As with Sunset, they co-wrote the screenplay with Richard Linklater. Linklater has made plenty of good films in his life, but this series will be his legacy. It will also be Hawke's and Delpy's. And it is to be included amongst the best things the cinema has ever produced.",Before Midnight
13,siderite,Nice ending (?) for one of the best romantic sagas in cinema,9,7 October 2013,"I am not a romantic guy and most of the movies about love and relationships either bore me or insult me. The Before * series consists of three movies that are in the so small category of romantic movies that are worth seeing. In all of them we watch a slice of the life of two people, interpreted by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy, from the moment they meet till the one they are married with children. Their problems are real, not dramatic, and their reactions are as far from normal Hollywood romcoms as you can imagine. That is what makes them great.Before Midnight sees the two protagonists on vacation in Greece, two twin girls in tow, apparently in the most perfect of relationships. That view suddenly changes when resentment and low confidence from both parts explodes, threatening to screw everything up. It is a movie in which very few characters are just talking, not unlike Woody Allen movies, but played in a completely different key note. To sum it up, all of the three movies feel like you are reading a book. That is so rare these days and I have enjoyed every moment of watching.",Before Midnight
14,StevePulaski,"Don't think, just watch",10,23 March 2015,"The nearly-month long period of time I have been indulging in Richard Linklater's utterly remarkable Before trilogy has not only made me more observant on fabled ideas such as life, love, and romance, but it has made me appreciate human connection and relationships more than I have in the past. I've always looked to connect and strike up real, meaningful relationships with those that I've met, but Linklater's Before trilogy has really made me analyze the beauty of the progression of relationships and, often, how feelings for someone can change for both the positive and the negative. It's the kind of film that puts a grandiose idea into perspective by showing you an application, giving you a representation of ideas that only existed as passing thoughts in your head.The original Before Sunrise was a terrific film, cutesy in the best possible way, showing a meet-cute between two young, idealistic souls who feel as if the possibilities of the world are at their fingertips and their connection is one of the many wonderful things in store for them during their lives. Before Sunset caught not only the two performers in a more confident, assured state of mind, but their characters in a place of humble disillusionment. Both quietly feared that their idealism was slipping through their fingertips, which were once seemingly instant sensors to the motor of the world, but they still remained generally optimistic in tone and were pleasantly introspective about themselves. Only one scene saw Delpy's Céline lash out at Hawke's Jesse and that momentarily made the audience uncomfortable.Before Midnight shows Jesse and Céline exhausted from the first frame. We see Jesse walking with his son Henry (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) to his flight, as he is about to fly from Greece, who is now living in Paris, back home to his mother, Jesse's now ex-wife, in Chicago. We see Jesse has published two books, is tossing around an elaborate, transient idea for the third one, and maintaining a relationship with his love Céline and their two twin daughters. A dinner with friends turns into an outing where low-key but evident animosity is bread between the value of what Jesse does as a man versus what Céline does as a women. He comments about her need to shortchange their relationship together, and she remarks how his writer complex makes him more attracted to bimbos than women he can hold a conversation with.The two roam the streets of Greece in a manner that echoes how they used to roam around large, spacious cities with no care in the world and nothing immediate on their mind. They reminisce and fondly recall of old circumstances together and the elephant issue at hand; Jesse wants to be with Henry during the crucial years of high school, which would involve him and Céline moving to Chicago because Henry moving to Paris is not an option. Céline doesn't want to do this because her environmental action has just landed her a dream job that requires work in Paris, and the two have clearly been bickering about this plan for quite some time, specifically, the few days after Henry leaves Jesse to return home to his mother.Most of the third act (about a good thirty-five minutes) takes place in a Greek hotel room, with Jesse and Céline arguing with one another about their plans for Henry, the expected gender roles of both of them, the fact that one shortchanges the other, and just life situations in general. Linklater perfectly executes these scenes so they're not overblown theatrics fogging up human behavior (he exercised such great restraint when profiling Mason's alcoholic stepfather in Boyhood). Yet after spending three films with these characters, watching them fall madly in love with one another and engage in so many romantic, thoughtful encounters, watching them argue is the equivalent of seeing your parents argue when you're a kid.Make no mistake, however; this long, slowburn scene is the epitome of the Before trilogy, alongside Jesse and Céline's first encounter on a train to Vienna. It indicates that this was a love that was best attended to in small increments rather than long term commitment (or is all love essentially like that?). Jesse and Céline have spent a great deal of time together, know each other by heart, and are growing restless of the weaker features of one another. Perhaps if they kept their ""nine year"" commitment in tact from their first meeting, maybe they would've gone on to have a stronger love for one another? But wouldn't they still feel like they're missing something or someone in their lives? Before Midnight is as rich of a testament to the human spirit as its predecessors, closing one of the most beautiful trilogies I've ever seen committed to film. Watching these three films has been my emotional movie event of the season, and which each passing installment I'm reminded more and more of why I not only praise Linklater for his ability to commit abstract concepts and relatable characters to film, but film's ability to connect, resonate, and deeply attend to the aforementioned human spirit. The entire Before trilogy is such a tender, affectionate handling of the concept through simplicity itself, so much so that if I encounter someone who doesn't understand the films, or find the beauty in them, all that can simply be said is ""don't think, just watch.""Read the more complete review on my personal website, http://stevethemovieman.proboards.com",Before Midnight
15,lasttimeisaw,a third time is still a charm!,9,20 November 2013,"We only know Jesse and Céline for two days in their lives (BEFORE SUNRISE 1995, 8/10; BEFORE SUNSET 2004, 9/10), but as if we have invested too much already, so at the beginning of this third chapter, when we realize that they have been living together for all these 9 years by now and even had two twin girls, is it a truly romantic fairytale comes true or the day-to-day reality has eroded the edges and corners and exhausted their acuity in dissecting what they are really thinking? The triad of Linklater, Delpy and Hawke will present us a most satisfactory delight delving into these two soul mates' current states of mind.Again tracing a one-day journey of the couple in their last day of their summer getaway in Southern Greece, in the morning, they see off Jesse's son Hank in the airport, who has to return to his mother, Jesse's ex-wife, which aggravates Jesse's paternity guilt for being absent in most of Hank's life, elicits an idea to move back to USA with the entire family, while they're driving back from the airport, the discord occurs when Céline rebuffs the connotation of the unscheduled idea, and a time-bomb is ticking, the first long take in the car signals as a gambit to re-ignite the audience members' coveted interest in their love story. Under the magnificent scenery of this ancient land, their farewell lunch with friends carries a casual spirit but the small talk is overflowing with engaging and emotively touching insights about love from different ages and experiences, Jesse and Céline are mainly listeners, but Delpy manage to pull off a splendid ad lib mimics a brainless bimbo flirting with Jesse the writer and talking about Romeo and Juliet, so hilarious and this is a patina when they are surrounded with other people. Later, they leave their daughters to friends and head to a hotel since they are treated to have a private evening in a hotel to culminate their last night there (with a couple massage coupon), clearly it is a god-given opportunity for them to express real thoughts without the interference of their children. Meandering in the town, everything is like deja vu, they are like two people deeply in love with each other and the sexual attraction is simmering when they reach the room, but their carnal engagement is interrupted by a pivotal call from Hank, their following tête-à- tête turns sours when Céline bickers about her sacrifice in the relationship and the frustration of parenting, utters discontent and spurns the prospect of moving to USA, meanwhile Jesse appears to be the calm one, but his passive-aggressive strategy fails to appease her and they begin to blame faults to each other, until Céline storms out and leaves the deal-breaker "" I don't love you anymore"". From convivial to acrid, it is so spot-on in everyman's world, then the ending plays a nice trick on the ambivalent possibilities of their future, fingers-crossed a fourth one will come another 9 years later and it will be worth the wait. Thumbs up to both Hawke and Delpy's scintillating acting, their resounding rapport and flawless two-hander should have earned some serious awards recognition apart from their effervescent script, good luck for a third time, Delpy could be a dark horse to bag a BEST LEADING ACTRESS nomination, and she is also French, Oscar voters, remember?",Before Midnight
16,KineticSeoul,Least favorite from the three,5,16 December 2013,"Despite the positive ratings this one has been getting. It's still my least favorite out of the three films. This time it leads more towards the changing of times, life after marriage, and rationality vs. emotions. When it comes to the past films in this franchise, both Jesse and Celine brought out some interesting points. But this time Celine is the dis-likable character. Maybe because I am a guy, but she just comes off as a bully that is super into the the feminist movement. She basically wants Jesse to bend over backwards in order for her to be satisfied. I don't know, this time around the back and forth conversation just seems more depressing and uncomfortable. Than amusing and intriguing, thus it feels drawn out. I won't be watching this one again, plus it lacks substance compared to the previous two installments. And seeing how it ends, there will probably be another installment. If not, this is just plain out depressing even if it relates to real life to a degree.5.5/10",Before Midnight
17,sddavis63,I'm Cutting This A Bit Of Slack,3,12 January 2014,"I have decided that I have to cut this movie at least a little bit of slack. Although I sometimes think that the rating on here are ridiculous, when over 41,000 people have given this a ranking of over 8, I'll admit the possibility that it must have something going for it. Mainly, I'm going to admit that because I realize that this is the third of a trilogy - a trilogy of which I was completely unaware. My wife rented this without knowing that actually. Had I known of the trilogy I would probably have suggested watching the first two before getting into this. But I didn't, she didn't, and so we rented this. And I still have to give my honest thoughts, noting that I haven't seen the first two instalments.I watched it two days ago and have been trying to let it percolate in my mind. Unfortunately my basic thought about it hasn't changed. After watching it and spending two days reflecting on it, I still really don't have much of a clue what it was about. Yeah. I get it that it's about the relationship between Jesse and Celine (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) - married with children but with a relationship that has more than a few issues, although at first at least it seems happy enough. So it's about them. OK.First of all, though, I thought there were far too many conversations going on - sometimes between them, sometimes between groups. Sometimes they just went on and on and on. The opening car ride with the two of them and their children sleeping in the back of the car was excruciating. I almost joined the children in blissful sleep. The scene around the table with the group who were invited there to spend the summer with the famous writer (why?) was heavy on philosophical meanderings but really not interesting. I wondered how the actors could get through the script awake. And the hotel room scene between the two of them where everything finally fell apart? Some think that was a magnificent portrayal. Me? I thought she was coming across as a - well - I won't use the word. I suppose the redeeming quality of that was that to me at least it finally portrayed the man of the relationship in a positive light, expressing love, while she seemed to be twisting his every word into some sort of attack on her, on her life, on her identity. Whatever. Yeah. It came across as a totally unnecessary feminist diatribe. Ultimately, it ended on a somewhat hopeful note. But I can't say I got too much out of it.But I'll cut it a bit of slack. I don't have the background of the first two instalments. Maybe that would put all this in context. Maybe. So - 3/10.",Before Midnight
18,Hellmant,Hard to sit through at times but it's still very well done and believable.,8,20 June 2013,"'BEFORE MIDNIGHT': Four Stars (Out of Five) Director Richard Linklater and actors Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy reteam to tell the continuing story of Jesse and Celine for the third time (following 1995's 'BEFORE SUNRISE' and 2004's 'BEFORE SUNSET'). Linklater wrote the script with Hawke and Delpy (the three also co-wrote the last film) and it once again picks up nine years after the previous film (just as the second film did) and focuses on Jesse and Celine's troubled relationship as they live with their twin daughters in Greece. As with the previous two films the movie is full of long dialogue scenes that seem like you're actually watching two real people talk about life. If that's something you enjoy in a film you'll probably like this movie.The film begins with Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy) now nine years into their relationship as a couple, living with their twin daughters (Jennifer and Charlotte Prior) in Greece. It's now nine years since they hooked up and conceived their children in the last film and eighteen years after they met on a train for Venice in the original film. Jesse is still a successful writer and Celine is wanting to start a new career in government. Jesse wants to move to Chicago to be with his son Hank (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) though, who lives with his mother there (Jesse's ex-wife now). This causes troubles in Jesse and Celine's relationship as she feels like she's being asked to sacrifice her career aspirations so Jesse can be with his son. Many arguments result and follow.The movie is quite painful to watch as the third act contains probably about thirty minutes of non-stop viscous bickering. It's hard to sit through at times but it's still very well done and believable; like a real slice of life. The first two acts have a lot of long and drawn-out dialogue scenes that are much less engaging but just as realistic. I know a lot of people that would be bored to death by this film but I'm sure they would be by the first two as well. This relationship trilogy has a very select group of fans but those fans do love these films. This installment is a lot like the other two in structure but takes place at a very different stage in the two main characters' relationship. It's a lot less magical and touching and more about life's ugliness but it does build to a good conclusion and has a positive message. Fans of the first two films should love it and fans of the genre should like it as well. It's one of those movies that's all about life and moves at a snail's pace but these films are just as important as the more entertaining and faster paced ones in my opinion.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOSZyJXrwyw",Before Midnight
19,Buddy-51,One-third of a romantic magnum opus,9,14 January 2014,"Watching ""Before Midnight,"" one is struck by how shallow and superficial most movies dealing with love and romance truly are.Principal credit goes to writer/director Richard Linklater, who has the uncanny gift for making all the dialogue he writes sound 100% real - given an invaluable assist from a cast of brilliant ad-libbing actors, that is. This talent is something he's demonstrated over and over again in his unique and utterly indispensable longitudinal study in romance: ""Before Sunrise"" (1995), ""Before Sunset"" (2004) and now his piece de resistance, ""Before Midnight."" The ""Before"" trilogy is similar to the ""Up"" documentary series, only instead of checking into the lives of some actual people every seven years as Michael Apted does, Linklater goes back to the same fictional couple every decade or so to see how it is they're faring. When we first met Celine and Jesse in ""Before Sunrise,"" they were two strangers in their twenties who, after a chance meeting aboard a train, proceeded to spend a romantic, albeit platonic, evening together in Vienna before he headed back to his home in the States and she to her life as a student in Paris. Though they vowed to reunite in six months time, they never actually did so.When, nine years later, they encountered each other again, at a book-signing in Paris, Jesse had become a successful writer, having used his encounter with Celine as fodder for a worldwide best seller, thereby capturing both her and the moment they shared in print forever. In his thirties at this point, Jesse revealed that he was married with a son, but that the marriage was an unhappy one. Celine, an environmental activist, had a boyfriend she rarely saw due to his job as a photojournalist. ""Before Sunset"" faded out on them finally consummating their relationship.As ""Before Midnight"" opens, we learn that Celine and Jesse have indeed become a couple and have twin daughters conceived in their night of passion. Jesse broods over the fact that he is living a continent away from his now-teenaged son , whom he gets to see only during the summer. Meanwhile, Celine, Jesse and the girls are spending their vacation traveling around Greece, staying with friends at a beautiful villa and taking in the sights.If ""Before Midnight"" reminds us of any film, it is Stanley Donen's great 1967 romance ""Two For the Road,"" with Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney as the long-married couple - also traveling through Europe - who have begun to take the long view of their relationship, examining how love and individuals change, sometimes for the better but often for the worse, over time (with its time-shifting narrative, Donen was able to accomplish in one movie what Linklater takes three to do - not that that in any way diminishes the achievement). Unlike most romantic dramas, which end just as the relationships are starting to become interesting, ""Two for the Road"" and ""Before Midnight"" hurtle bravely on into the future, to a point long after the initial concerns and rituals of courtship and giddy romance have faded and the realities and concerns of a far more prosaic everyday life have come to take their place.Infidelity, the demands of parenthood, the pressures of work and career, the idealism of youth fading into the cynicism and compromises of middle age - all these issues are put under the microscope and brought into sharp focus in ""Before Midnight,"" which clearly shows that Celine and Jesse are not the same people they were when we first met them - nor should we expect them to be. For life is not static, and neither are the people who are constantly being molded and shaped by the experiences it throws at them. The characters here talk about love and relationships with a depth and insight rarely found in even the most profound of personal dramas.Eschewing the plot mechanics and melodramatic contrivance that gum up so many movie romances, ""Before Midnight"" consists mainly of long, often single-take scenes that capture with uncanny accuracy the rhythm and flow of natural conversation. Jesse and Celine know each other so well - have become so comfortably intimate with one another as a couple - that they can talk about a wide range of topics, from the most trivial to the most profound, and not miss a beat, secure in the knowledge that the bond between them is stronger than anything they might express in words. That's how come they are able to emerge intact from a particularly withering half-hour-long argument in a hotel room in which souls are bared and long-simmering grievances are finally brought out into the open.Of course, the series could never be what it has become without the stellar work of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, two outstanding actors who have literally come to inhabit these characters over the course of three decades. Together they perfectly embody Linklater's vision of what a real romantic couple looks and sounds like at various stages in their relationship. And it's all enhanced by a lovely musical score by Graham Reynolds that nicely brings out the romantic flavor of the piece.The idea that two distinct and strong-willed individuals can exist both as separate entities and as a couple - and make it work - is the thesis that informs every moment of ""Before Midnight."" In his series, Linklater has wiped away the gauze that enwraps most movie romances to show us the real and vital thing that beats underneath. And, in so doing, he raises the bar that all future filmmakers, working in the genre from hereon out, will need to try to reach.",Before Midnight
20,thesar-2,Midnight Madness,6,2 September 2013,"For most folks, it's been an 18-year journey. For me, it was a Sunday.I recently sat down, and travelled, to see all three BEFORE movies, which ended with Before Midnight in theatres. It was extremely nice to be able to see Before Sunrise, Before Sunset and Before Midnight all consecutively verses over almost two-decades of filmmaking.Maybe this gave me a different perspective. I loved the first movie, admired the follow-up and felt Before Midnight, while a nice send up to the two decade journey of two characters, kind of, hard to watch.That's not to say it wasn't good and nice to see these two lovebird's conclusions. And it ended (spoiler, sorry) just as they predicted throughout the franchise. I, too, saw the signs and learned a lot about how these two soul mates would view life in the future. But, the fantasy was gone. The reality really hit hard.Following the wonderfully ambiguous finale of the second chapter, Before Sunset, you learn that these two humans have, in fact, finally got together and stayed that way. In fact, they now have children of their own. The movie follows the same staple pattern of the first two, whereas the camera follows the couple, Jesse and Celine, around as they converse in under 24-hours. Only, now they're dealing with the consequences of making sure they are together.This movie relies less on romantic love and more on realistic situations for couples. It's a reality check for those who fantasize about romantic encounters. While it's still rich in great dialogue, it's such a culture shock for the hope of the first two movies.Yeah, I guess, at times, the sh|t's gotta get real, but maybe I loved the love story of the first two more and found myself engulfed in the fantasy of true love. Still, it's worth a watch, if you want to see how these two turn outafter 18-real-years of both Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy's lives.",Before Midnight
21,gbill-74877,The magic continues,9,21 September 2020,"The first half of this installment in the series is a little below its high standard, as the dialogue is a tad lackluster and ventures into sex (sometimes improbably) a little too often. The outdoor dinner table scene with three other couples from different generations comes to mind, but is saved a little bit with that last lines from the older woman, remembering her departed husband, which ends with ""Like sunlight, sunset, we appear, we disappear. We are so important to some, but we are just passing through.""However, the film really picks up when Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy vent the stress and frustration of their characters in that Greek hotel room, where it's absolutely brilliant again. There is a lesson in arguing here as some of the things they say are incredibly hurtful, but there is also such honesty, love, and perseverance, and I think this is what it takes to stay together in a relationship over the long haul. There are also key little moments when either side could simply quit, which mirror earlier turning points, such as when Delpy's character decided to get off the train in the first film. There is a sense of fragility and luck in how these little moments play out, profoundly affecting our lives, but also a sense of strength and direction in accepting the other person, flaws and all, and holding tight. The arc of these characters has such truth to it, the script is excellent, and the acting top-notch. Great ending too. I'd love to see another in 2022!",Before Midnight
22,cricketbat,Not as strong as Before Sunrise.,4,23 November 2018,"Before Midnight feels realistic, but it's also quite pessimistic when it comes to relationships. Julie Delpy is either a very good actress or a very unpleasant person to be around. I found myself wishing Ethan Hawke's character would just walk away from the crazy lady. The conversations in this movie are more compelling than Before Sunset, but this movie isn't as strong as Before Sunrise.",Before Midnight
23,secondtake,The three films together are stunning! But this is the least of them,7,15 November 2013,"Before Midnight (2013)The most interesting facet to this slim movie is that it continues the singular predecessors with such glowing continuity. Most people know that Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke started their conversational fictional companionship on film with ""Before Sunrise"" and then continued it with ""Before Sunset."" The first of these was shot in 1995, and the next followup was nine years later, and then this new one, nine years more.If you saw (and liked) the first two films as I did, this continuance alone makes ""Before Midnight"" worth checking out. And if there is a huge deadening flaw here it is simply that the continuing continues so expectedly. There are times here when this couple—which has been living together for nearly a decade—talk as though they are on that first date in 1995. It's not that they don't know certain things about each other, but more that they are talking about things as if for the first time--and they are such common things. Surely they've gotten around to some of this stuff before. It's not endlessly revelatory.The director of all three films is Richard Linklater, and he absolutely gets a lot of the credit for an easy, almost languid style. Some would call it boring—all talk and walk, nothing much to watch. But it isn't boring. The first movie for sure is the most fresh (it was the first one), but the second keeps things really interesting because the two leads (Jesse and Celine) are meeting up again after a huge gap, and it's an odd and unpredictable situation. By 2013 things have fundamentally solidified. They are a happy couple with twin girls, living in France. The day proceeds with conversation, and we listen closely (there is nothing else to do), but in fact there is nothing to be surprised or even curious about.So the words become so critical they can't help but fail. A long dinner conversation with a group of educated friends is fast paced and filled with clever banter, but it goes nowhere. Yes, you absolutely wish you were there (and maybe that you had such friends—that would depend). But what is said is not so wonderful after all. It's just a mood of warm, lively companionship.Likewise elsewhere. It's all fun and clever. When they squabble a bit it never seems remotely possible that the fight is for real, or that the incredible ease and love shown earlier in the movie would unravel with a slight ill wind. The very last scene confirms, and is oddly wan.So—a mixed bag. I truly think if you haven't seen these films you might find the style and the remarkable believability (at times) really special. It is. But for me it was more special and more interesting as a story in the earlier movies. This one can now not be separated from those, however, and the great whole, a trilogy with a possibility of more to come, is a special and worthy part of contemporary cinema. Start somewhere and see what this is all about.",Before Midnight

This little event leads to Jesse questioning his decisions in life and leads to trouble in his marriage. In preparation for watching this movie I watched the two previous ones. Before Sunrise was OK but a little slow moving. Before Sunset was better but still nothing amazing. This one is far and away the best of the trilogy and feels the most real. Sunrise is about a chance meeting on a train. Sunset is about reconnecting love after a book tour brings him to the place she is. This one deals with real world issues and finally answers the question of if these two should be together or should they have left it as a one night meeting. I'm sure I'm not the only one to say this but this reminded me of me and my wife and fights we have had. That aspect may have helped me really get into this movie but either way this is the best of the three and I recommend this which is something I can't really say about the other two.

25,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews,8,30 October 2013,"Before MidnightBefore you do anything at midnight, double check the clock to make sure that it's not actually 12:00 noon.Fortunately, the couple in this drama has an excellent concept of time.Nearly a decade after we last saw them, successful American author Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and his French lover Céline (Julie Delpy) are now raising twins.At the end of their Grecian summer vacation, the pair spends the night at a hotel. During their evening, a heated debate about their relationship is ignited.While Céline calls Jesse's fidelity into question, he challenges her parenting skills, which results in her doubting their love.With its relevant stance on relationship qualms, this second sequel to Before Sunrise serves as an endearing and worthy bookend to the dialogue heavy trilogy that began in 1995.Luckily, thanks to Greece's recession, you can easily get out of the doghouse by buying your wife the Parthenon.

While the first two are feel-good movies, this is a depressingly and painfully realistic film that bursts the bubble of romantic ideals and depicts life as it really is. But it still does not give up on optimism, because where there is a will, there is hope.Now that I have seen all three, it is difficult for me to observe and evaluate them individually. Although I liked ""Before Midnight"" the least in the trilogy, and immediately after watching it I was somewhat disappointed, when my impressions settled, I realized that any other end would be inappropriate and that the trilogy would lose as a whole.9/10 (for a trilogy as a whole)",Before Midnight
28,Platypuschow,Before Midnight: Hopefully the finale of an overrated series,2,22 July 2017,"Before Sunrise & Before Sunset were two critically acclaimed movies that I simply didn't understand. Though they were beautiful they had little substance and were essentially 90 minutes of two people's random conversations and no actually storyline.18yrs later the third movie came out and picks up with our pair being an actual couple, at first I detected a hint of of purpose but it quickly descended into random pointless banter. The last third of the movie get's oddly dark and becomes uncomfortable viewing and then suddenly like that the credits are rolling and I'm breathing a sigh of relief.Arguably the weakest of the three Before Midnight for me is devoid of entertainment value, the only new thing it brought to the table was the revelation that Julie Delpy has one boob considerably bigger than the other. Yep, that little tit-bit (Pun intended) was all I could take away from this mess.What would have made this a more watchable feature is if something happened with...............anything. I'm not a guy who requires action, in fact I don't enjoy the ""Action"" genre but this is unforgivably dull.Three bags of nope, a sack of awkward viewing and a box of please please don't let their be a sequel.",Before Midnight
29,Reno-Rangan,I am eager for 'Before Noon' and I can't wait till 2022!,8,10 October 2013,"I liked it but not as much first two. Both the main characters chose awesome topics to talk in all the 3 movies between that about themselves as well. I was curious like everybody else about the story where it ended in the second part. Without a proper confirmation whether it was a happy ending or a sad like as usual. So this movie states that from very beginning itself without holding anything behind.It was a rare trilogy, I even did not know the third movie was in production, all the sudden it is now in digital copy. There are lots of fine elements in the movie to like it, One of those were dialogues. I mean what they talk, about life and others stuffs. The presentation was a bit different than earlier two. The smartest thing they did was adding half a dozen of extra characters to the story in the appropriate timespan. I thought was surprisingly good but for some people it did nor work. The nude scene was unnecessary, for glamour? I don't think so. I thought the movie should have kept open for all age groups like first two.I think this movie series will go on and on for next 30-40 years till both of them dead. If it happens then it will be awesome, probably I'll be old when fourth sees a light. Hope you enjoyed it as much I did or see it if you have not seen yet.8/10",Before Midnight

It's a movie in which again has passed nine years and now we have a beautiful couple who has two beautiful children. This movie is filmed in Greece and it shows us some really nice sight seeings of it which makes you feel nostalgia and this is something that you can feel it when you only see it by yourself, but this movie makes you feel it and this is something really extraordinary.Ethan Hawke makes a really wonderful interpretation to this movie such as Julie Delpy does, and I liked them very much finally as couple!

31,Red-125,Jesse and Celine 18 years after they first met,10,30 June 2013,"Before Midnight (2013) was directed by Richard Linklater, who also directed Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004). If you've seen the two earlier films, you'll remember that Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) meet for one night, were separated, and met again by chance nine years later.Now, nine years after the second meeting, they are married and have young twin daughters. Ethan has become a successful author, and Celine has been offered what is apparently a high government post in France. They have spent the summer on a glorious Greek island. They should be extremely happy, but they're not.When the film begins, Ethan's son from his first marriage is returning home at the end of summer to be with his mother in Chicago. The dilemma around which the plot revolves is that Ethan would like the family to move to the US so that he can be closer to his son. Celine has no intention of giving up her job and her home to move to Chicago. There is simply no obvious way to make this situation work.The plot of the film is really a series of discussions--actually arguments--between Jesse and Celine as they struggle with their own needs and the needs of their spouse. The dialog rings true, but it's painful to watch and hear.Both actors are attractive. In fact, Julie Delpy is strikingly beautiful. However, at age 43, she no longer has the slender, wand-like figure she had when she was 26 or 35. (In fact, Celine mentions this in the dialog.). So, the actors have aged, just as their characters have aged. We want these two intelligent beautiful people to stay in love, and to work out their problems and be happy. Can they? Will they? I'm not sure.We saw this movie on the large screen, but it will work well enough on DVD. (Some of the great touristic shots of the Greek island will be lost, but the rest will be OK.) The film will stand alone if you haven't seen the two earlier movies. However, it will enhance your enjoyment if you see all three in order.",Before Midnight
32,howard.schumann,A primer on what does not work in a relationship,6,16 June 2013,"Feelings of regret, remorse, and guilt dominate Before Midnight, the third film in Richard Linklater's ""Before"" trilogy. The film takes place in Paris eighteen years after Jesse (Ethan Hawke), a then young American aspiring writer first meets Celine (Julie Delpy), a French graduate student on her way to Paris from Vienna. In Before Midnight, now approaching middle age, Jesse and Celine are a couple living in Paris and have settled into what appears to be a long-term relationship. Though not married, they have twin daughters, Ella and Nina (Jennifer and Charlotte Prior). As the film opens, Jesse is saying goodbye at the airport to his son Hank (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick), who is returning home to Chicago where he lives with his mother, Jesse's ex-wife.At the airport, Hank tells his dad that it was the best summer of his life which only makes their parting more difficult. Jesse wants to be closer to Hank but his ex-wife will not permit it and he discusses with Celine the possibility of her giving up her job as an environmental advocate and moving to Chicago, a topic that carries with it a great deal of baggage and is a bone of contention during the course of the film. As in the first two films, the third consists mostly of extended rapid-fire conversations between Jesse and Celine as well as with Jesse's literary friends with whom they are spending six weeks at a writer's workshop in Greece.At an outdoor luncheon at 85-year-old Patrick's (Walter Lassally) villa, talk centers on a wide range of subjects such as whether books are still viable in the modern age of computers, how different age groups relate to love and romance, and other relevant topics that sound ""deep."" To make sure we know that the film is ""edgy,"" Linklater sprinkles the dialogue with cutesy references to sex, orgasm, and genitalia that feels as if one has wandered into a high school cafeteria rather than a gathering of artists and intellectuals. As Jesse and Celine walk back to the luxury hotel that their friends have given them as a gift for the night, tension surfaces and they begin to tease each other and question each other's commitment.When they arrive at the hotel, the good feelings of the afternoon have dissipated into bickering about who is at fault for everything that is wrong with their lives. Dangerously close to gender stereotyping, Jesse is depicted as the strong and calm one while Celine is shown as borderline hysterical. Talking at each other rather than to each other, Jesse again tells Celine about his regret at not being closer to his son and thinks about how he could fix the problem, but never acknowledges that it was his choice to leave his family. Celine shouts about how he abandoned her when the girls were born and calls him passive-aggressive to which Jesse responds by telling her she is ""a crazy woman."" After Celine complains about how her creativity has been stifled because of the lack of time she has to do anything other than to be a housewife, the quarreling deteriorates into a tug of war to the point where Celine walks out of the room. Before Midnight restates the conventional wisdom about the spark in relationships inevitably fading with the years but the result feels more like an artistic concept than an organic experience with the characters having sacrificed their reality to the formula. Some critics have said that the no-holds-barred outbursts in the film are examples of adult behavior and are ""proof that the couple has finally achieved a true intimacy."" To me, however,though well-done and engaging, Before Midnight is a primer on what does not work in a relationship. A relationship should not be a power struggle but a partnership based on mutual support in which the partners truly listen to each other without always having to be right. Contrary to the film's message, love does not have to die in order to be reborn, but can be created newly each day. That does not mean that all problems magically disappear, but only that you are willing to include any condition or any circumstance of the relationship as part of your experience of love. Here's looking at the next sunrise.",Before Midnight
33,l_rawjalaurence,A Wonderfully Sour-Sweet Analysis of Middle Aged Love,8,4 July 2013,"I did not see the other two entries in Richard Linklater's series, so cannot comment on the ways in which this film develops the themes already raised. What I can say, however, is that BEFORE MIDNIGHT is a really searching analysis of love in middle age between Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Céline (Julie Delpy). Shot in a series of long takes against wonderful Grecian locations, director Richard Linklater explores the psyche of a couple who have spent a long time together, cannot get away from one another yet end up perpetually fighting. The film is a study in (mis-)communication; how words and sentences are perpetually misunderstood by both protagonists as they try to assert their particular points of view. This time the major cause of controversy is whether they should return to the United States to be with Jesse's teenage son Henry (even though they would only see him every other week due to custody arrangements), or whether they should continue to live in Paris with their seven-year-old twins. However the subjects don't really matter; what's more important is the way Linklater's camera unremittingly focuses on their facial expressions, as they experience a variety of emotions ranging from abhorrence to insecurity to loneliness. The dialog positively crackles with wit; the locations only serve to reinforce the mood. This is a holiday romance; but a romance with a difference. It's got bite as well as beauty.",Before Midnight

35,Turfseer,Gripping final third of Hawke-Delpy marital discord show consumed by earlier two thirds of static talk-fest,5,20 February 2014,"Richard Linklater has served up a good number of worthy cinematic items in the past decade including 'School of Rock', 'Fast Food Nation', 'Me and Orson Welles' and 'Bernie'. He also has the two prequels to 'Before Midnight', ''Before Sunrise' and 'Before Sunset', which I have not seen, but hear were pretty good. 'Before Midnight' picks up the story nine years later, with novelist and part-time professor Jesse (Ethan Hawke) dropping off his son at the airport on the Greek Pelopennese peninsula where he's been vacationing with wife Céline (Julie Delpy) and their two young twin daughters (Seamus Davy-Fitzpatrick is a knockout as Jesse's son sensitive son, Hank, who we meet briefly at the beginning of the film).The unfortunate thing about 'Before Midnight' is that for two-thirds of the film, it violates the screenwriter's canon which is of course, 'show don't tell'. Sure there are films that are dialogue heavy and sometimes they work well, especially in the case of a courtroom drama. But 'Before Midnight' is not a courtroom drama. It's an examination of a relationship between a long-time married couple, possibly coming apart at the seams. But until the gripping conclusion, there is little conflict.Instead, we're treated to a great deal of witty banter between the principals, some of which is quite interesting, but in the end, hardly memorable. To make matters worse, some of these conversations take place in one spot--the worst of which occurs as Jesse and Céline (along with their two children who hardly play a role at all in the story) drone on and on inside their car, as they drive from the airport, after dropping off Jesse's son. It's maddening to sit there with the camera never shifting an iota, as the two principals converse.Things improve slightly when Jesse and Céline arrive at the home of a Greek writer friend and there are other adults there, including the writer's son and his wife, who add their two cents regarding life's travails. Perhaps the highlight there is Delpy's seductive Marilyn Monroe impersonation. Later, Jesse and Céline take a long walk through a tourist spot, ending up inside an ancient Greek Orthodox shrine (there Céline makes some rather sacrilegious sexual comments which weren't very amusing). 'Before Midnight' finally picks up when Jesse and Céline return to their hotel room and go at one another. At last the characters seem to find their voice and the conflict becomes apparent. Jesse is accused by Céline of focusing too much on his son, to the detriment of their relationship. And Céline in Jesse's eyes is a whiner who seeks approbation as a beleaguered feminist. Clearly the more nuanced portrait of the two is that of Céline, who really does come off as unreasonable and neurotic. It's only through Jesse's patience that the ship finally is righted and the relationship is restored to a semblance of equilibrium.Clearly 'Before Midnight' is one of the overrated indies of the year. Yes, one must admire the witty repartee between Hawke and Delpy as well as the high intellectual level in most of the dialogue throughout the film. Nonetheless, as noted above, one becomes restless for the central conflict to emerge and overwhelmed by the amount of dialogue. With so many ideas tossed about, it's hard to remember hardly any of them—those who have seen the film more than once, probably could appreciate it more. A healthy balance between all the ideas and the visuals is what 'Before Midnight' really needed. Unfortunately, the film remains top heavy with so much dialogue, that it ends up too heavily weighted toward the intellect, than to the heart.",Before Midnight

Or, at least, it didn't work nearly as well as the previous two, which were near masterpieces. Before Midnight is a talkfest, which is not a problem, but it's a boorish talkfest, which sort of is. It has moments of absolute brilliance surrounded by what feel like epochs of people arguing and giving no ground. It may be realistic, but it's sure uncomfortable to watch at times.We catch up with Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) in Greece, where they are vacationing with their twin daughters. They are returning to a friend's house after dropping off Jesse's son at the airport - you might recall he married and had a kid between the first and second movies - and converse while their girls sleep in the back. Jesse is still the rakish, if unshaven, man he's always been, and Celine is still utterly beautiful. But whereas in the previous movies there had been love lost and found, here there may be love lost, period; there is something afoot in their relationship. There are many areas of stress, many complications in their lives, and from the beginning the viewer suspects a break up is around the corner.The movie is a bit of a cross between Scenes from a Marriage and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Well, more precisely, to Scenes from a Mall, Woody Allen's homage to Bergman's Marriage. There's a lot of talking, and some deep-seated feelings are revealed, some inadequacies and vulnerabilities laid bare. Is the relationship on the rocks? It may depend on your own prejudices. I'm probably prejudiced to take Jesse's side, because for the life of me I saw him as the victim (to be fair, only for the most part) and Celine as the aggressor. I'm not quite sure how to process that; do I feel that way because that's what I was seeing or because it was what I expected or could better relate to? I'm not sure. But I can tell you this for certain: each conversation between Celine and Jesse seemed to veer from tenderness to viciousness quicker than a jackrabbit doing handstands while on meth. It became hard to witness after a while, because Hawke and Delpy are both so good that one was immediately invested in their prospects. For me, that meant I would go from being joyful at the love each obviously (still) felt for one another to cringing at the sight of their malicious bickering.The enduring question arises: if either had the chance to do it over, would Celine get on the train with Jesse, and would Jesse ask Celine to get on the train with him? We get conflicting answers, as if each is testing the other's fidelity while professing not to care. One minute they're happy to grow old together, the next each is questioning the other's motives. For Jesse, he feels that his son's childhood is slipping away and wishes he were more a part of it (in Chicago, rather than France); for Celine, she has a chance to take a better job with a man she dislikes but is caught between doing something for herself and doing something for the family in general and Jesse in particular. The bouncing back and forth between melodrama and quiet, romantic interplay is jarring, even if it is realistic. I'm certainly not saying this is how many relationships go, not at all; it's just that I wouldn't want to witness one of these euphemistically named discussions in person, either. It's not entertaining, even if it's real, like eavesdropping on an old married couple across the hall while they argue about duvets or table runners or something equally mundane, only with the conviction of Patrick Henry asking for liberty.As with the earlier films, the movie focuses almost exclusively on conversations between our two leads, with two exceptions: one is a group dinner in which (surprise) truths are revealed, and the other is two scenes in one, with Jesse talking to the men in the film and Celine to the women. Every scene is a cornucopia of philosophies, some earthy and some pretentious, some with hidden meanings within the plot's framework, some existing just to exist. One needs to have one's head on a swivel to keep up with the changes in tone and the number of intentionally misunderstood phrasings.The sheer poetic chemistry between Hawke and Delpy remains palpable as ever. Delpy is outstanding - lovely, sparkling, and passionate. Hawke, who's made quite a name for himself as a scruffy Gen-X nonslacker, is also superb. And Linklater's direction is surehanded. It's just that, in the end, it feels as if nothing has changed, that the previous two hours meant nothing to the characters. The movie took me on such a emotional ride that, rather than be enthralled, I was exhausted and spent by its middling conclusion.",Before Midnight
37,meeza,Before I say another word..... Brilliant!!! (could not resist),10,19 July 2013,"It is time to inform you before the clock strikes twelve (or any time for that matter) that ""Before Midnight"" is one movie that you should not miss out on. The film is the third of a trilogy of the ""Before"" romantic movie franchise that includes ""Before Sunrise"", ""Before Sunset"", and now Midnight. For those of you who did not wake up to Sunrise or ease on to Sunset, please make sure you check them out before going into the Midnight ""all you can love"" movie buffet. The central figures of the franchise are Jesse (played wonderfully again by Ethan Hawke), an intellect writer, and Celine (perfected once more by Julie Delpy), a French environmentalist. For those of you who have not heard of their story ""before"", I will synopsize it. Here it goes, a young Jesse and Celine meet on a Euro train in the mid 90's and had an unforgettable evening in the streets of Vienna while conversing about a plethora of topics while getting to know each other; that is ""Before Sunrise"" in a blink or so. Forward ten years later, Jesse is now a successful writer and Celine a thriving non-profit environmentalist and fate has them reunited in France in one of the stops of Jesse's book tour; hence ""Before Sunset"". Forward 7up on years and we have midnight. In ""Before Midnight"", Jesse & Celine are a full-fledged couple and are no mas ""one time in a decade"" lovers. They live in Paris, and have two twin daughters. Jessie is now an even more successful writer and loves Celine and their daughters, but wrestles with the situation of missing his teen son who resides in the states with Jesse's alcoholic ex-wife. Yes, Jessie did have another girl during Jesse & Celine's decade break from sunrise to sunset. Celine is fed up with the struggles of the non-profit world, so she entertains the thought of linking up with a corporate company. Speaking of links, Director Richard Linklater develops ""Before Midnight"" with a continuum of what made ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"" such delights; insightful conversation, profound emotional disclosures, witty banter, sparkling chemistry, breathtaking scenery, eccentric supporting characters, and so much more. Linklater is due a Best Director Oscar nomination and hopefully it will come no later than next year during Award season. Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy are a trio team of verbal brilliance by mustering up another enchanting & cerebral screenplay to ""Before Midnight"" as they did in ""Before Sunset"", but this one is even better. The scenes between Jesse and Celine in a hotel room disclosing their insecurities, anger, resentments, loneliness, and jealousies were perfectly written; one of the most vigorous dialogues I have ever heard in an elongated movie scene. It will be tough to top this scribe as the Best Screenplay of 2013! But don't quote me on this before I see the rest of the movies coming our way this year. Nevertheless, a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar nomination is already in the can for Richard, Ethan, and Julie. Speaking of Oscar noms, I think its about time the Academy takes notice of the multi-talented Julie Delpy and nominate her for a Best Actress nomination for her grand thespian effort in ""Before Midnight"". Her multi-dimensional performance as Celine will leave you in a Julie state for a few days. Not to be dismissed, Ethan Hawke delivers another brainy, sharp performance as the scholarly romantic Jesse. He is also deserving of an Oscar nom. ""Before Midnight"" delivers in all aspects in exemplary filmmaking and acting; so I do urge you watch this movie as a morning flick, an afternoon matinée, or even better a midnight movie treat. ***** Excellent",Before Midnight
38,pixrox1,"Boy, this couple sure can fight!",8,29 July 2013,"And the beauty of BEFORE MIDNIGHT is that this is NOT Stanley and Stella arguing over Blanche in some tawdry trailer park, but all the word play is taking place in some of the more gorgeous areas of Europe, with a foreign phrase thrown in here and there for atmosphere. Furthermore, if you bring a guy to this flick on date night, he can get an eyeful of Julie Delpy angrily yakking to Ethan Hawke for an endless ten minutes with nothing on between her mouth and her waist. This seems to be a habit carried over by Delpy from the 1995 and the 2004 entries in this Richard Linklater trilogy (BEFORE SUNRISE & BEFORE SUNSET). So you can promise your guy to come back in nine years (that would be about 2022) to check out if Julie is holding up as well as you are!",Before Midnight
39,estebangonzalez10,Richard Linklater's best film,9,4 August 2013,"""Like sunlight, sunset, we appear, we disappear. We are so important to some, but we are just passing through.""It has been 18 years since Jesse and Celine first met on a train and had their lives changed with that encounter, as did ours because Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy created one of the most authentic romantic and memorable relationship on film. This is the third film of the franchise and in my opinion it is the best one because it feels even more real than the previous two. The previous films focused more on a romanticized idea of love, but here the tone of the film shifts as we see this couple facing true challenges in their relationship. There is no doubt these two characters love each other deeply, but that doesn't mean their love is perfect. In Before Midnight we are at a stage in Jesse and Celine's relationship where they have some important issues to resolve. Their relationship is on the verge of a breakdown due to several problems they never dealt with until now and have really escalated. The performances are so good that you never feel like you are watching a movie; it is more like a documentary about a couple facing some serious problems in their relationship that they are trying to resolve through communication. I don't think I've seen better dialogues about relationships than I saw in Before Midnight. There were some very emotional moments and overall I thought these 3 films complemented each other very well. Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) have decided to live together after their encounter 9 years ago in Paris. Jesse left his wife and son to live with Celine who immediately got pregnant with twins. In the present the couple is spending time in a vacation home in Greece with a writer who has invited the family to spend the summer with him and his friends. The film opens at the airport where Jesse is saying goodbye to his son, Hank (Seamus Davey Fitzpatrick), who is returning to America after visiting his father. On their way back to their vacation home Jesse discusses with Celine how fast his son has grown and how bad he feels about not being able to be near him during these critical years in his life. Celine doesn't want to return to America because they tried that in the past and it didn't work. She also has a great job opportunity at home, and this minor argument seems to only be the tip of the iceberg in their relationship problems. They are as cute as ever together, but there are still many unresolved issues that really put their relationship on the verge of failure. Despite it all this still is a very romantic film that explores new ground in the Before trilogy. It has been a great deal of pleasure being able to walk alongside this fantastic couple through the different European cities and listening to what these two have to say to each other about love, life, and relationships. They are so good together that it never becomes tiring or tedious to sit through. In this third film I felt like they were at their best together. The arguments felt so real and authentic that it sometimes was uncomfortable to sit through because we really want to see these two work their issues out. Like any other couple they say hurtful things to each other and that really builds the tension in this film because they are so charming together that we really want the two to find a way to resolve their issues as soon as possible. I really loved the ending in this film and thought it was a perfect tie to the first film. It was the best film of the trilogy, but you won't appreciate it as much if you haven't seen the first two movies to fully understand what is at stake here. Before Midnight is one of the year's best films and amongst Linklater's best movies. It is a heartwarming, raw, and funny movie about love and relationships with some terrific performances.",Before Midnight

43,3xHCCH,"Words So True, Yet So Uncomfortable to Hear in its Familiarity",8,11 July 2013,"I watched ""Before Midnight"" almost right after I watched ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset."" The effect of seeing Jesse and Celine almost two decades after that fateful initial train ride to Vienna is just so strong. I can just imagine the experience for those who had seen the three films in real time, like reuniting with old friends after every nine years.In ""Before Midnight,"" Jesse and Celine are now living together with 7 year old twin daughters. They are spending a long vacation in Greece with Jesse's writer friends, and they are at the tail end of that holiday. At this point in their lives, Jesse is saddled with guilt because he wants to spend more time with his son who lives with his mom in Chicago. Celine on the other hand is deciding whether to get back into the work force with an offer she calls her ""dream job.'The couple were given a free night at a beach side hotel on their last night. As the previous two movies went, there was a lot of talking in this film. But the talk here was definitely more mature, from poignant to painful, and every word felt so true.Couples who watch this together will most likely re-examine their own relationships. I am pretty sure many of the things you will hear spoken between Jesse and Celine you have heard in your own conversations with your spouse, specially those who have been married for more than ten years or so. You may even want to watch this by yourself first so you can reflect on your own marriage. The message is so direct to the point and frank, it can be so uncomfortable to hear in its familiarity.The ending again is so open. The audience is invited to give their own ending as before. Director and head writer Richard Linklater succeeds once again in bringing our old friends back to us, as charming and as vital as ever.

45,EUyeshima,"Linklater, Hawke and Delpy Reunite for an Enriching Third Time",8,26 October 2013,"If a youthful sense of hope informs ""Before Sunrise"" and a wistful sense of regret does the same in ""Before Sunset"", then a begrudging sense of resignation must be the overriding theme of this 2013 romantic drama as director and co-screenwriter Richard Linklater picks up the story of Jesse and Celine 18 years after they first met on a train to Vienna. This time, they are an established couple though tellingly, still not married. Jesse indeed left his loveless marriage after the end of ""Before Sunset"", and the lovers are now in their early forties raising twin girls. For the second time, Linklater wrote the script with co- stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, and together they achieve a level of familiarity with their characters' relationship that makes the incidental story resonate in ways quite unexpected. Unlike the first two films, there is no ticking clock manufactured to provide a need for resolution by the end. Instead, the fate of the couple's relationship is entirely in their hands, and now that we have an emotional investment in the characters, that's what makes this entry more compelling.The movie flows leisurely picking up the particular rhythms of conversations that show how words can become weapons. The story begins at the end of an idyllic Greek vacation where the couple has been staying with friends of various generations. As Jesse puts his now- adolescent son Henry on a plane headed back to Chicago, it becomes clear that his ex-wife didn't take the divorce well and now has full custody of Henry. Jesse shares with Celine his struggle in being so far away from Henry, and they banter about the challenges of parenthood and her indecision around accepting a government job. You would think that the stage they are in their lives would not yield much in the way of romantic sparks, but when they meet their friends for a farewell meal, they return to their familiar selves as they discuss the challenges in making human, much less romantic, connections in the digital age. Their friends decide to treat them to a romantic night at a nearby hotel, and the dialogue comes back to just the two of them. The chemistry between them percolates in a subtle manner as they walk to the hotel stopping to ponder the sunset.Once at the hotel, the friction begins mildly when the front desk clerk, an effusive fan of Jesse's books, insists Celine autograph her copies. Although she obviously served as his inspiration, she had nothing to do with the writing and bristles at the request. Then a phone call from Chicago sets off tensions that had been simmering between the two about the possibility of moving away from Paris to Chicago. Their verbal combat scene has the brutal honesty and up-and-down rhythms that feel more realistic than most such fights depicted on screen, and that's what makes the scene more powerful since things said in the most matter-of- fact way sting with inevitable consequences. Looking understandably worn, Hawke and Delpy know their characters and each other's so well they don't need to sketch out a backstory. We've already seen it, and together with Linklater, they've written it and perhaps will continue to shape their future. The director and actors continue to evolve as much as the characters do. So where will Jesse and Celine as 50-year-olds be? Chicago perhaps""Before Tomorrow"" maybe?",Before Midnight
46,dierregi,My favorite fictional couple strikes again,10,16 July 2013,"Jesse and Celine are my favorite fictional couple. I followed them from their first meeting 20 years ago and I am still not tired with them. As I expected, this installment is a great movie, both as stand-alone and as the third part of the series.In this chapter, Jesse and Celine deal with the inevitable problems and disappointments of approaching middle age. They are both still very attractive and well-articulated, but now they carry the burden of responsibilities and are starting to consider the idea of their final demise (although hopefully still far for both of them).This time they walk and talk in Greece, during the last day of a six-weeks holiday. Jesse is dropping off his son Hank to the airport. We learn that Jesse harbors some guilty feeling about having somehow ""abandoned"" the son from his first marriage, although Hank looks very well adjusted. Outside the airport, Celine waits for Jesse, their twin-daughters sleeping in the car.Their first conversation takes place while they drive back to their friend's house. They talk about the burden of parenthood, work problems and relocating to the US. No flirting, but still excellently executed. The second long conversation is at dinner, with their friends. It touches several subjects, among which the different perception of love, according to your age. Since the age of their friends varies from early 20s to late 60s, the conversation is very compelling.Then Jesse and Celine walk to their hotel, where their friends insisted they stay to get one night of privacy and romance. We understand clearly that nowadays they hardly ever have conversations that are not utilitarian, which makes the situation very realistic. Once they reach the hotel, drama ensues in the shape of a major argument.Anybody who quarreled with a loved one will undoubtedly admire the skilled way in which the argument is presented: the anger about trivial matters, the resentment about past events, the illogical change of topics.... During this exchange, their national idiosyncrasies are exploited in a subtle, yet funny way (Celine cannot pronounce an English word, etc...). I took Jesse side, as he seemed a bit more grounded, while Celine, in all her French arrogance crossed the border from shrill to almost hysterical (although she had some good points).But no matter how bad things get with them, I still hope they will stick together and will transform their passionate love into a mature feeling. Despite their denial, they are still giving hope to all the romantics about the possibility of everlasting love.",Before Midnight

The romance has grown from just a reunion into a family. But the 'catch' neatly planted in the second film now takes its toll. This movie spans the all too well known screenplay style of strolling and talking style into one that involves more people than just the two focus characters. It's kind of a shocking moment for me to some graphic moments in this movie after being used to all the beautiful strictly dialog screenplay. But then I get the relevance of the scene, being that they're now a family, it will be natural. Hawke and Delpy still kept their connection, and managed to build even more on the family aura.",Before Midnight
48,Movie-ManDan,The Most Different From The Three...,9,16 August 2020,"...is also what makes it my favourite from the series. Now more than ever, we need a breath of fresh air from all the mindless stuff put out these days. And just before the ""Before"" series becomes stale, changes got in motion.In 1995, two young strangers meet on a train and fall in love. Nine years later they reunite. In both films, the romance seemed so enchanting that it was unrealistic. ""Before Midnight"" breaks that rule with Jesse and Celine approaching a mid-life crisis and possibly getting sick of each other.Jesse and Celine live in France with Jesse's son from his previous marriage living with them in the summertime. When he heads back to his mother's Jesse realizes that since he is entering teenage hood that he needs to be in his son's life now more than ever. This leads to our protagonists bickering over living arrangements.They vacation in Greece where some very beautiful shots are taken on the Greek landscape. Best looking of the three movies, easily. We get some throwback to some great conversations but this one actually seems to unfold and go places while the other two didn't.While hearing this intelligent dialogue, we see their marriage crumble before our eyes. But Hollywood must save the day. This look into dark territory is both original and realistic. It also provided a great throwback to Ingmar Bergman's ""Scenes From a Marriage."" I guess the only thing preventing perfect scores in this series is that each film could have been about 50 minutes and offered us just as much. That's what Bergman did with his miniseries. But ""Before Midnight"" has come the closest to getting a perfect score.I love this series, I love its stars, and I cannot wait for the next entry in 2022.3.5/4",Before Midnight

I felt that way for maybe 1/2 of this latest film and then, for me, it just deteriorated into one long argument between the two protagonists, often accompanied by vicious barbs and personal verbal attacks. I thought for a moment I was back watching ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"", from decades before.It was not entertaining for me to watch Jesse(Hawke) and Celine(Julie Delpy) try to win this argument by throwing out all the stereotypes, generalizations, and platitudes that you might find in ""Men Are From Mars-Women Are From Venus"". They've been together now for many years, and the parents of twin girls Ella and Nina. Jesse is divorced and his son Henry is just leaving Jesse to head back to the States where he lives with his mother.

50,bkrauser-81-311064,Part III of the Most Geniuine Love Story,8,10 January 2014,"The first time I saw Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise (1995) I was about the same age as the characters in the film. It was also 2008 so the film series Before Sunrise, Before Sunset (2004) and now Before Midnight (2013) had a bit of a headstart on me. The film hit me like a freight train providing a very, very accurate foil for the things I was dealing with. I had just ended a longterm relationshipwell she ended it, and I was stuck in an existential funk, unable to really find a proper place in life. Yet through it all I was still optimistic. In essence, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) was me in a nutshell; the fact that he and Celine (Julie Deply) were walking around Vienna where I spent three years of my childhood was another added bonus.Eighteen years after their first encounter and nine years since the last movie Jesse and Celine live in Paris. Before Midnight sets up the situation; the couple is spending the last few days of their Grecian vacation at the summer home of a fellow author. They have twins (Jennifer and Charlotte Prior) and Jesse is seeing off his son from his previous marriage (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) who is about to start high school in the States. Jesse is troubled that he hardly ever sees his son and has been fiddling with the idea of moving back stateside. Meanwhile Celine fiddles with the idea of starting a new job in Paris.The film follows roughly the same format as the first two in the series. Jesse and Celine converse and weigh the options they have while enjoying the breathtaking scenery around them. There is more interplay between other characters in this one but most of the dialogue takes place between Jesse and Celine. You would think that things would get tedious after a while yet the dialogue crackles with a stylized realism that keeps you interested in the conversation. It's as if they say all the things you'd say if in a nine year relationship only uttered by two beautiful people who don't stammer as much.I'll admit Before Midnight is probably my least favorite of the trilogy (thus far) not because it's a bad movie; very, very far from it. It's almost too good of a movie in fact. As I have said before, the film series has a headstart on me thus I am not a parent, a career man or even consider myself a full-fledged adult. The conversations to be had in Before Midnight are less the ones I would have and more the ones my parents had when I was younger. To that extent, Before Midnight makes me want to evaluate the man I am becoming.I tried to have my girlfriend sit and watch Before Sunrise. We had to shut it off after twenty minutes as she was bored to tears by a movie consisting of largely dialogue. This is a girl who loved Seven Samurai (1954) so I'm not about to judge her harshly for brushing off what I consider to be arguably the most genuine movie about love. Regardless, I hope that our love stays as lively and as beautiful as that of Jesse and Celine. What happens after a romantic finds what he's looking for and walks slowly into the sunset?

52,Sergeant_Tibbs,"The mere idea that Jesse and Celine have days like ""Before Midnight"" everyday is more overwhelming than an epic drama.",9,26 June 2013,"The first time I saw Before Sunrise and Before Sunset I didn't think  much to them. I thought it was a cute concept to revisit characters,  particularly with the irony that Jesse wrote about Before Sunrise but  it wasn't until a rewatch when they opened up. I wish more films were  two interesting people talking and walking through beautiful cities,  especially if they can be as breezy and rewarding as Before Sunset. So  now that I'm a fan, I was excited for Before Midnight and felt that it  could tie the knot that the first two left loose. It did. Midnight is  definitely the funniest and most hard-hitting film I've seen in a long  while. In the other films I've found their existential conversations  interesting but it's never felt like they've dug their fingers in my  brain like this film. It feels like a mirror of my feelings. In a  single shot they articulate all the transient anxieties I have about  the world and life in a more profound way than I could've achieved in  my lifetime. With its real-time gap in time between films with events  and moments only left to the imagination of the viewer, that element of  reality is fascinating. The mere idea that Jesse and Celine have days  like Before Midnight everyday is more overwhelming than an epic drama.  But beyond the fiction, there's a scene where Julie Deply is topless  through a range of emotional tones which adds an extra strange element  of reality that the other films don't have regarding the chemistry  between the leads. As Ethan Hawke suckles on Julie Deply's nipple, the  idea of an intimate relationship between Hawke and Deply in reality  lifts the fiction of Jesse and Celine to a new realm of emotional  impact, especially considering the sharpness of their argument scene.  Midnight has one of the best endings I've seen and if it left it at the  penultimate scene, I would've been far too wrecked. The humour is just  so poignant and wonderful and true. On a technical level, the film is  terrific considering their choices of where to set conversations and  how they're executed in long shots. I loved the way the score for the  film was adapted from Celine's ""Waltz For A Night"" song from the end of  Sunset. As always, the acting is genuine and charming and while it  struggles to adapt to the barrage of side characters at first, they do  have something fascinating to say. Before Midnight is draining but  thoroughly enlightening and satisfying. I have no hesitation in calling  it the best of everyone's careers and best of the year unless anything  else hits me harder.  9/10",Before Midnight
53,napierslogs,"The evolution of lives, the devolution of a relationship, and the fight of immaturity versus maturity",8,1 July 2013,"Eighteen years later, and we once again get to look in on the lives of Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) for a day. Richard Linklater is a master of dialogue; ""Before Sunrise"" (1995) and ""Before Sunset"" (2004) frequently cited as examples of the best written romantic dramas in existence. The good news is that ""Before Midnight"" fits in that line. Jesse and Celine have finally found time in their hectic lives to just have a meandering conversation again.This type of filmmaking offers so much opportunity for the evolution of the characters. Allows for insight into the maturation of Jesse and Celine, and especially for those of us who have watched since the beginning, insight into the maturation of ourselves. Regardless of how you feel about the type of people Jesse and Celine have become, the film is still good because it still has to be partially realistic. It has been nine years since we last saw them, and the number of paths for their lives are endless. This is just one of those possibilities.""Before Midnight"" has a very different feel to the two films that came before it. It's no longer just Jesse and Celine. They have kids and they have friends. The latter of which take up a large portion of the movie. The other big change from the previous films is that the 9 years that we spent apart from them, they didn't spend apart. In both Sunrise and Sunset, Jesse and Celine only saw each other when we saw them. But now they've had nine years together and we haven't. Some of the intimacy is lost.The point of course is that these people are now in their forties. Life changes. Jesse and Celine are no longer growing together, but growing apart. We have a one hour window into a relationship in shambles. Everybody praises these types of films for being realistic. They must feel there is a shortage of them. I liked how sad they were together; their arguments against one another were more biting but also reasonable.Like the previous installments, this one is rated R, but this time it's warranted. Jesse seems to have become even more immature – talking about sex even more than he did as a 23-year-old American. Perhaps it's the French influence. Celine seems to like have arguments naked. That's definitely the French influence. Maybe in 9 years time, Jesse can move back to his Texan roots. Allow us to explore how people become more like their original selves the longer they spend away from it.",Before Midnight
54,proud_luddite,Outstanding!!!,10,18 February 2020,"This film continues the great love story between American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Frenchwoman Céline (Julie Delpy) that began with Before Sunrise (1995) and continued with Before Sunset (2004). Now in their early forties, the pair must deal with the realities of reaching middle-age.Hawke and Delpy are co-screenwriters along with director Richard Linklater. Hawke and Delpy are also in nearly every scene, most of the time being the only two people on screen. A ""talky"" film could be dull in most cases but this super-talented pair are stunning and brilliant in their abilities to bring real life to the screen so well.Whether philosophizing about life over dinner with friends, joking around, looking back on life, concern about the lives of their young children, or having a terrible argument, this film has such depth and truth, it is mesmerizing.The long argument scene is so effective it is easy to switch sides one would take as an observer. The acting and writing are so powerful that way. Also, considering that so many of these long conversation scenes were done in single takes (including a car ride with sleeping kids in the back seat), it is not an exaggeration to call this film a masterpiece.Considering the genius of the two prequels, Before Sunrise and Before Sunset (also very highly recommended), Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy already deserve a special place in film collaboration history. But let's hope they're not finished. One can hardly wait for another installment in 2022.Rating: 10 out of 10Outstanding Achievements:Screenplay by Richard Linklater, Ethan Hawke, and Julie DelpyPerformances of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy",Before Midnight
55,maurice_yacowar,The lovers from two earlier films fall into marital frustrations.,8,3 July 2013,"Like Before Sunset and Before Sunrise, the central lovers are a rare combination of intellect, wit, sexual candour, philosophy and self-destruction. The film abounds with echoes from the first two films, climactically when to win Celine back at the end Jesse replays the Time Machine game he used to coax her off the train at their first meeting. The outside dinner scene presents the whole spectrum of romantic relationships -- a widow, an open marriage husband, a lusty middle aged couple, two beautiful young lovers -- and the film proceeds to place Jesse and Celine on that spectrum. In moving from Vienna and Paris to Greece the film digs back into the classical roots, primitive emotions straining against civility.

56,sharky_55,This is real life.,8,3 January 2016,"One of the initial shots of Before Midnight is not something that has been seen before in the trilogy; the camera swings around to reveal the family that we have been anticipating since 2004, twin daughters sleeping in the backseat. The camera had been mostly static previously, capturing the couple as they walked aimlessly and talked endlessly. The settings, Vienna and Paris, were beautiful and exotic, but they would have fallen in love in any city in the world. It does not look cinematic, and yet that initial shot at once conjures up so many questions of this new chapter of their lives. This time, they vacate in the southern Peloponnese and it is just as stunning, but there is nothing blissful about the experience, and the most riveting scene takes place in a shabby hotel room, where Linklater swaps the iconic medium two-shots that have been pervasive throughout the trilogy, unblinking in their long takes, with shot-reverse-shot, and cuts up the space between the couple as they argue. It is not until the final shot that Linklater really uses the setting, and we dolly back to unveil the shimmering ocean and gorgeous harbour-side twinkling in the night. There is another distinct break from tradition; whereas Sunrise and Sunset almost exclusively featured only Jesse and Celine, madly falling and re-falling in love, Midnight has a cast of other characters, and it is here that it slightly falters. For all the philosophical musing and long-winded anecdotes about love, they feel like ideas and conversations for our main characters, but instead of trimming sensibly, they have been reintroduced into the dialogue of others. It is easy, for example, to compare the wide-eyed, lovestruck experiences of the young couple to another young couple that met on a train all those years ago. And when Xenia Kalogeropoulou heartbreakingly reveals that she is forgetting the little things that her late husband used to do, and how it is like losing him all over again, it feels a lot like Celine's monologue in Sunset, where she ends with one single clear memory: the red in Jesse's beard. These feel less like fully realised supporting characters, and more like younger and older versions of Jesse and Celine. But returning to the pair reveals a deeper and more mature narrative yet. Sunset ended on a magnificent cliffhanger, but we all knew that the heartbreak of the missed opportunity was too great, and that they would not let another chance slip away. They have twin daughters. Celine's accent comes and goes but has noticeably faded. Jesse's novels are now famous enough to be recognised by Greek receptionists (and this creates probably one of the best and more subtle scenes of the movie, where Celine is visibly bothered by being placed in a little box and designated as a character in Jesse's life - I have no doubt that the Madeline version of Celine is fully realised, successful and happy - moreso than Celine anyway). When they rewind time and talk of that fateful train encounter all those years ago, it is startling how different they are now; Jesse hesitates just slightly when asked whether he would act the same way, and it is clear that Celine is no longer that radiant, carefree muse that caught his eye so long ago. And then there is perhaps the finest scene in the trilogy yet, which physically separates the pair within the frame and has them explode over each other's dialogue. There is so much raw emotion that spills from their mouths, but I think it is not overly vicious for the sake of hurting the other person. Like the back and forth pinball conversation in Vienna, it is defensive; they each attempt to explain their own perspective and their own feelings on juggling the various responsibilities of their chaotic lives. It is easy to write an argument and have two characters drown each other out in their anger, but in this case they pounce onto every word, broken promise, illogical leap and change of opinion, and throw it back into each other's faces, trying to gain an edge. Every phrase is twisted and extrapolated to its extreme, all except one; when Jesse confesses that he 'ruined his life' for her singing, it is such a clear opening for Celine to attack and tear down his arguments on how committed he is, but she relents, possibly because she thinks their relationship is still worth saving. He too, does not explode when she hangs those fatal words in the air and admits she does not love him anymore, because he is not so sure he is ready to believe it is over. The previous two films feel like daydreams compared to Midnight. A fresh-faced youthful Jesse described love as an unselfish, giving and beautiful thing. But it is clearly not as easy to say that when juggling such an emotionally painful predicament like their's. In the midst of their argument, there is a moment of such startling and brutal honesty. Celine confronts him with accusations of an affair from long ago (and I am sure that this is not the first time it has been brought up), and Jesse does not outright deny it, but adamantly reaffirms his love and commitment to her. It is so brilliant because we believe his lifelong commitment, but we also know that the affair has happened and has lingered over their relationship ever since. Infidelity is something that is so often treated as a comedic device in movies, but it is so easy to forget that it is a very real thing in many real life relationships. Here, we trust that their bond is strong enough to withstand such an affair, and move on from it. The red in his beard may have vanished long ago, but their love has matured and learned many lessons.",Before Midnight
57,PartialMovieViewer,Celine is just not nice,4,30 April 2015,"This is a movie about a miserable woman. Celine is snarky, venomous, abhorrent, heinous, and all those other words that can double for hateful. I guess the acting was pretty good since I could not stand either character at the end. Celine was missing her broom and Jesse was missing his nuts. This was a cinematographic finger nail scraping across the Tinsel Town chalkboard. Yes, as said in many other reviews, the closing credits was such a refreshing termination to 'Before Midnight' and started many in the audience repeatedly uttering, 'Why?' over and over again. This assault on the senses was awful. I cannot believe this bunch of emotional junk got eight stars and then I thought againmaybe they meant hate stars. Sadly, Julie Delpy did such an outstanding job in her roleI would not stand her when I left. From here on out whenever I see her, I will see 'Celine' the-she-devil. She was so spiteful and so hateful – I was kind of hoping she would be slowly eaten by little baby sharksah well wrong movie. Now Ethan Hawke – what were you thinking? This is a very good actorbut I will have to say, if I was playing 'Jesse' and getting all that grief 'Before Midnight' would have ended before breakfast. This was a painful experience and I am glad it is over",Before Midnight
58,bettycjung,Should this couple be together?,3,11 June 2018,"6/6/18. I heard so much about this Hawke-Delphy franchise and finally got a chance to watch this one. While it is considered a drama/romance, it is hardly that. It is a 109-minute, non-stop talkfest. Do you know any couple who can talk this much in that amount of time? Here are two people who spend their time together trying to rationalize the reason why they should stay together, then diverge on issues of commitment, self-fulfillment, dishonesty and infidelity (but is it really, when they are not married?). After all that talk, you really have to wonder if they even belong together. Kind of being forced to watch a relationship disintegrating before your eyes and not being able to tell them to just shut up and think about what they are saying.",Before Midnight
59,cultfilmfan,Before Midnight,8,19 September 2013,"Before Midnight is the third in a series of films that started with Before Sunrise in 1995 and Before Sunset in 2004. Now in 2013 we are reintroduced to Celine and Jesse the couple that first fell in love in Before Sunrise and met and rekindled an old flame in Before Sunset. One thing I have really enjoyed about each of the Before films is it's philosophical yet intelligent dialogue. These are not films with a whole lot going on other than great dialogue and character study expressed through strong writing and dialogue. I also give writer/director Richard Linklater a lot of credit for spacing the films out as he has because we get to see these two characters at different stages in their lives and as with anyone and with age so much can happen to us personally with our personalities and the situations we are dealing with. Actors, Ethan Hawke and Julie Deply reprise their roles and also share on the screen writing credit here as they did with 2004's Before Sunset as well. As much as I liked Before Midnight, I would have to say that it is probably my least favourite of the trilogy. I think what I loved so much about the first two films (especially Before Sunset, which I have watched multiple times and it just seems to keep getting better and better) is the chemistry and romance of these two characters. How they once met and fell in love on a train and not knowing if they would ever see each other again, but in Before Sunset, how they can just get up and talk and still have that sense of love and chemistry all those years later as if nothing has ever changed between them, even though it has almost been a decade since they have last seen, or talked to one another. The first two films in the series were light and filled with beautiful European surroundings of where these two characters are and they talk about their love and ask questions about both love, themselves, life and the future. All of which could be dull to some, but because of the fantastic delivery from the actors and the well written dialogue, we often feel like we are right there and we get to care for these two characters and feel a connection to them. The first two films were about romance and making it work and discovering things about one another. I think I enjoyed this magical aspect of the first two films because it felt real and beautiful at the same time. Before Midnight, while I still enjoyed it, does take us on a bit of a different path than the first two films in the series and is what I found to be a much heavier and somewhat darker in tone style than the first two films. I really do not want to give anything away, but as with relationships that have strain, or complications in them, there is a lot of soul searching, self reflecting and trying to figure out love and marriage in this film. At the same time there is also a lot of fighting, and tense and hostile situations between the two characters. Not with violence of course, but with words, which could be equally damaging. I completely understand what the film was trying to do and say with these two young lovers now grown up and facing a crisis in their life, but perhaps that is not what I wanted to see. Call me a deluded optimist if you must, but I was hoping for more of the same from the first two films and just a wonderful and growing connection between these two characters now into their early 40's. I wanted to recapture that innocence and magic of the first time they fell in love and how they were able to start anew again, but most of what I was exposed to was more on the depressing side and instead of being full of magic and charm the film turned out to be a bit of a downer mood wise. Like, I said earlier, I can completely see where the director and actors wanted to take this relationship to the next level and make it feel real because a lot of what they do fight about felt real and what I would assume would be the conversations of most couples when they are in a tense, hostile, or upset state. Maybe, I just personally did not want to see it because I care for these two characters so much that I wanted their marriage to still have that magic and charm with it and that they can still be devoted and hopelessly in love, so to speak. I do commend the film though for trying to make this relationship as real as possible and take it to the next level even if I personally was not prepared for it. My only other complaint is often I felt this time around the dialogue was a little more vulgar and filled with profanity than the first two films and it did not have that classy, or intelligent feel as much as the first two films and at times these characters seemed almost unattractive and ugly. Not in a physical way of course, but because of what they are saying and what they have become. The film still does give us a glimmer of hope and I am still hoping for a fourth round here. If not I will have to remain content on these three films and while I liked Before Midnight, I have to be honest and say that it didn't work for me as well as the previous two, but was a realistic ending and choice, whether I wanted to see that, or not.",Before Midnight

I too have to see my two boys to the airport on their way back to the USA every summer, but different to how the main character in this film takes it, I am out for a good week, fully depressed, ready to go to the other world, may be it will be better there, and so forth, you know depressed. I love this scene, I will share it with my sons when they come back to see me.All together this is an excellent, out of real life plot (love those), with crisp dialogue, characters, acting and cinematography. All in all a very entertaining summer film, which I would recommend to everyone. Enjoy!",Before Midnight
61,Likes_Ninjas90,It is not just a 'boy meets girl' story. Its 'boy meets girl and realises they're going to die someday.',9,9 July 2013,"The third film in Richard Linklater's trilogy, after Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, is the most satisfying and complete of the revered series. Most sequels grow stale by resting on the formula of their predecessors. The strength of this trilogy is that each episode, filmed nine years apart since 1995, reflects a new perspective on the changing relationship of its central characters Celine and Jesse. This has prevented the series from losing its essentiality because with each addition the characters and their attitudes to life and each other have changed over time and feel anew.One of the unique aspects of the trilogy is that it is compromised almost solely of dialogue. This is rare today when Hollywood films prefer action and effects over dialogue and character. There are only five or six sequences in Before Midnight, each one comprised simply of characters talking. These conversations are rich, purposely reflecting how relationships are tested by time and conflicting perspectives. While the previous two films merely teased the possibilities of Celine and Jesse's relationship, Midnight reflects the consequences and the regrets they have about their choices. It leads into some huge fireworks but refuses to exchange the depth of the series for pure melodrama. It is still funny, deep and personal, often achingly so in its long and authentic exchanges.Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke reprise their roles as Celine and Jesse, who are now an unmarried couple, with twin girls of their own. Jessie has divorced his wife but is struggling with being separated from his son Hank (Seamus Davey-Patrick). While holidaying in Greece, Jesse and Celine debate the idea about them moving to the US so that they can see Hank more often. Celine is reluctant, considering the possibilities of a job offer instead. Some later discussions talk place in the villa of an elder writer named Patrick (Walter Lassally), who is housing them and some other Greek couples. One of Celine and Jesse's most heated conversations takes place in a hotel room, which tests the increasingly brittle foundations of their relationship.The screenplay by Richard Kelly, Delpy and Hawke draws a complex binary between the speed of time, dwelling on the irreversible events of the past, and fixed perceptions that force one to look too far into the future. The source of Jesse's anguish is not simply his current separation from his son but being divorced from the irreversible years of Hank's life. His plea to move back to the US is fuelled by preempted nostalgia for his son's teenage years: ""If I miss these years, they're never coming back."" Celine's pessimism stems from a culture clash, believing they won't be happy back in the US, and predicting that this is how people breakup, comparing their relationship to a ticking time bomb. Her conflicting perceptions of time are amplified by her resistance to autograph Jesse's novels, containing semi-autobiographical details about their relationship. There are also brighter, romanticised feelings drawn from loss, with another character reflecting on how they were still able to still see all of their miniscule details of their partner after they had gone. It's suggested that it is important not to love one person but to have a love of life by reflecting on those fleeting moments while you still can.The film's various ruminations on time and space are embodied by Linklater's camera as it lingers over the handsome Mediterranean setting. One of the more amazing scenes is a car ride conversation that is sustained for nearly fifteen minutes without a single cut. The naturalism of the scene is exemplified by the director's insistence that every word of dialogue was written down and not improvised. The duration of the medium shot, framing Jesse and Celine together, demonstrates how they exist in the same spectrum of time but through their bickering they often forget how lucky they are to share the important moments together. Colour and space are used distinctively, with red and green primary tones enriching the vibrancy of the domestic scenes, while in the hotel room the spaces are more contained and the tones drab to infer a claustrophobic tension. As the couple argues, the reverse angle shots and deep lenses fracture and separate their spatiality to remind us of their conflicting beliefs, drawn from perception and nostalgia. Both performances achieve an unbroken magnetism, supplied by the director's willingness to provide his actors with as much time and space possible to invigorate these roles.Although we have seen many films examine relationships, few have analysed the couple via the framework of insightful philosophical musings and with such an intelligent and consistent discourse. How many romantic comedy-dramas are sophisticated enough to have conversations veering from gender roles, the inevitability of death or the dread of spending another fifty years together? The film is about the way time and age have believably shaped the once optimistic and impulsive beliefs of both Celine and Jesse. It is not just a 'boy meets girl' story. Its 'boy meets girl and realises they're going to die someday.' It encompasses all the troubling realities that Hollywood likes to shield from us.",Before Midnight
62,Christian_Dimartino,"Not tremendously exciting, but does every summer movie have to be?",9,20 July 2013,"It's summer, duh. So, what kind of movies do we expect from the summer movie season? Sequels, huge-budget action thrillers, probably a few comedies, a few animations, you name it. Richard Linklater's Before Midnight is a sequel, but it's not exactly the sequel that applies to the other characteristics I previously mentioned.Where movies like White House Down and The Lone Ranger blow things up for two hours, Before Midnight is more of an intellectual movie. Before Midnight is an expertly written and acted drama about love. It's the kind of movie that has you listen, rather than just watch.18 years after Jesse and Celine met on a train to Vienna, Jesse and Celine (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) have twin girls and are vacationing in Greece. But this time, their trip is a little different. When we first met them, they barely knew each other. Now, they really know each other, and we watch the two interact and slowly fall out of love.Like its predecessor, Before Midnight is co-written by Hawke and Delpy themselves, which just helps with the realism of it all. The script is sharp, and so are the leads, who have obviously grown into much better actors in the past 18 years. Before Midnight is real. It is occasionally funny, and it never feels forced.This is the best reviewed film of the year so far, or at least one of them. But I can't quite call it the best movie of the year. It is one of them, definitely, but it isn't the one. Why? It's simple. It really isn't that much of a movie. All it is is Hawke and Delpy walking around in a beautiful location and talking. But this time their conversations are much better. Before Midnight knows what it's talking about when it comes to love, and I doubt anyone is willing to argue.A-",Before Midnight
63,braddugg,"I sincerely believe, an honest conversation between a man and a woman is the purest form of romance.",10,7 September 2014,"I sincerely believe, an honest conversation between a man and a woman is the purest form of romance. This one is a sequel to the beautiful movies, ""BEFORE SUNRISE"" and ""BEFORE SUNSET"". Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) have grown to their early 40's and they go through the relationship and phase. Celine has twins from the relationship with Jesse. It's Greece and a whole new level of conversation takes up. If ""SUNRISE"" in 1995 made Jesse and Celine meet. ""SUNSET"" in 2004 got them closer by another chance meeting. ""MIDNIGHT"" in 2013 depicts them as they were together since ""SUNSET"".It's a pastiche of romance, their love making, arguments and even silences . There are many conundrums in the talk and they surprised me as ever like the earlier two movies. If in SUNRISE, love blossoms, then in SUNSET it settled down, now in MIDNIGHT it darkens. It's better to talk to crib to argue than to be silent and that's exactly how it is depicted. This is more personal though than the earlier films, but as a ""BEFORE"" franchise fan, I loved their connect and the basis and reasoning of their argument seemed good, though at times kiddish but that's how adults behave. Arguing for petty things. serious for the unimportant and jovial for what they have got already. The cinematography stands great, the art, the costumes, everything is perfect, But it's not for these aspects, I watch this film, it's only for the conversation that the couple have. Kudos, once again to Richard Link later, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy for having written such lines. For things the talk fluid and simple and connecting. For most in their prime 30's or early 40's this may seem like their daily talk and for those who have not got into a relationship, this is a taste of how things may turn out. But all is fair in Love and that's exactly how this film ends. Richard Linkalter is one of the most underrated directors I believe.OK, now a word before I complete my review, I am appalled by our Indian Film Distributors, they put a date of July 26th for release, then postpone this to August 23rd, while the movie was released long back in March in USA and other parts of Europe. So instead of waiting for a theatrical release, I just downloaded and saw it. I badly wanted to catch this in theaters, but am happy coz I caught it and am so delighted.It's another 5/5 to one of the most beautiful romantic movies ever.

In the case you're in approximate age of the protagonists, you'd probably appreciate these movies even more.What kicked off as a romantic night in Vienna and continued as soul searching in Paris ends up as a slight midlife crisis in Greece. There are some differences to the previous installments, namely the first part of the movie is centered around a lunch, echoing the feasts of Ancient Greek theater.The characters have matured, their conversations as well. In hindsight, what began as quasi-artistic scenario of Before Sunrise has obviously been a conscious choice of the authors. Before Midnight is still one long conversation.

65,ClaytonDavis,Before Midnight is a Masterpiece (****),10,1 April 2013,"Before Midnight is a different type of animal this time around. I didn't expect the team could top an already beautiful story but what they achieve in the newest installment is the most accurate and authentic portrayals of love since Michel Gondry's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004). The film is an absolute marvel, showcasing the very best dialogue and capturing the sheer essence of acting brilliance from stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Director Richard Linklater has also created the crowning work of his directorial career, showing incredible restraint and focus on two characters that still feel just as new and fresh as the day we met them. The film opens with a near fifteen minute take that gets its hook into you and never lets up. It's a cinematic sensation. Midnight takes place nine years after the events of Sunset. Jesse and Céline are still together and have managed to have twin girls, Nina and Ella, and are living in Europe. The film takes place at the tail end of a six-week vacation in Greece where Jesse has just dropped off his thirteen-year-old son Hank, from his previous marriage, at the airport for his return back to Chicago. Realizing that he's missing the formative years of Hank's teenage life, Jesse and Céline explore the option of possibly making a move to America, leaving opportunities and a life in Europe behind. This film is easily the best film of the franchise so far. Packing an emotional and euphoric punch like third-installments like Toy Story 3 (2010) and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), films that have a close-nit relation to their predecessors but saving all the masterful speeches and epiphanies for the viewer to indulge in their finales. Obviously there's no big fantasy battle or a near death experience in an incinerator for the meaning of life to be physically explained but in the power of words, and words alone, Before Midnight manages to become the poster child for screen writing and brilliant storytelling for years to come. The film doesn't take any cheap shots with every scene constructed from real emotion and feeling incredibly authentic and genuine. There are long takes for the viewer to be present whether it's in an airport conversation between Jesse and Hank or at a lunch with in the beautiful valleys of Greece or even in a hotel room where a man and a woman share intimacy like older lovers typically do. Ethan Hawke is an actor that never quite caught onto the awards circuit for some odd reason. Nominated for his performance alongside Denzel Washington in Training Day (2001), Hawke has shown tremendous range throughout his career including missed opportunities for recognition in Sidney Lumet's Before the Devil Knows You're Dead (2007). As Jesse this time around, Hawke uses every ounce of magnetism, charisma, and acting ability to bring himself to the levels of legendary actors like Daniel Day-Lewis and Marlon Brando. He becomes a man all too familiar to the male viewer and ignites the film into a spectacular frenzy of passion. Hawke isn't afraid to show the inner turmoil of Jesse as the growing cancer of guilt has come to the surface. He works moment after moment in expressing the bewildering beauty of love at the expense of one's own values and sacrifice. He's almost the distant, and utterly toned down, cousin of Freddie Quell from Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master (2012), a man so complex but inserted with terrific character beats and an actor willing to commit entirely to the craft to portray him flawlessly. Hawke surpasses not only his past features but the very being of himself as an actor. It's his finest turn yet. Julie Delpy is as imaginative and magnetic as ever. She's a wonderful presence, often very skillful example of acting on the finest level. She executes the pure feelings of uncertainty in conjuncture with the script which is a clear and marvelous character study on love. She's wildly immersed into Céline, accomplishing not only a somewhat free- spirited damaged woman but a sex appeal that triggers any person's romantic desires. She's an effortless existence in the film, which makes Céline not only explicitly real, but tenderly and mysteriously loving for the viewer. It's a performance that defines her abilities as an actress and one that will be remembered fifty years from now as we all think back on the amazement of Julie Delpy. The film is breathtakingly accurate and precise in capturing the love and relationship of couples, it will and should be studied by film schools and writers for years to come. Linklater bares his soul, frame after frame, showing confidence of his own idiosyncratic vision of this story and being as accessible to even the youngest of people. This is Linklater's most personal tribute to the scope of cinema and will be his defining moment on the silver screen. The film is a must-see and is the first masterpiece that 2013 has to offer. Before Midnight is an instant Oscar-contender and a triumph in filmmaking. It's the go-to film of the Tribeca Film Festival and the best picture of the year so far.",Before Midnight
66,diane-34,Such an enchanting yet painful exploration of love.,10,19 July 2013,"Diane and I watched this third leg of the trilogy of similar movies yesterday and enjoyed it so much we watched the first one on DVD at home that evening. The story has many elements of our own romance: meeting in Europe, talking our way through darkened streets and trains playing an important side role. Fortunately we avoided the stress of their relationship (ours is 40 years and stronger) so beyond those fleeting intersects their story is not ours. It does, however, go some way in explaining why both of us love these three movies and particularly yesterday's: the third one. I think this movie is a phenomenon; I was continually amazed that Hollywood would financially back a film centred on the relationship of two people who are on camera for the entire film. This film had trains rather than exploding cars, gentleness rather than aggression and intelligent talk rather than interminable shouting. This film was so un-American in that it was built around two people talking to each other for the length of the film. These two people exchanged ideas constantly; they talked about ideas rather than simply talking about the mundaneness of life: what's for dinner, who does the shopping, are we getting a good deal from the tradie, etc. Before Midnight was such an endearing film because it had people talking about the ""glue"" that held their relationship together and this makes the movie a massive cut above others; these people actually have subjects of substance to say to each other. As a viewer you might get tired of this constant dialog but to us it was refreshing. I would recommend that you make every effort to see this film and if you already haven't rent the previous gems so the story gets filled in.",Before Midnight
67,Offworld_Colony,So different yet again in this series as to be fascinating;,10,17 February 2020,"Much more of an ensemble piece, and with kids in tow, it changes the dynamic of the film just like it does to any relationship. As does Jesse's success and artistic career, a topic explored interestingly here in ways that most likely reflect the lives of all the creators and actors involved.We see their pragmatism as a couple, we see their family, we see their connection and we see their disdain and their evolution as people. But only at the end do we see both their hate and their love, often two sides of the same coin for long-term couples. Their love is still there, it's just shifted and adapted to their new lives with all the challenges they now have.I always likes this movie but never connected to it previously, I thought the end was sad, deeply sad, how could two people who love each other say these things to each other? Or feel this way without a total collapse of their relationship? But now, being in a committed, long-term relationship with someone in their 40's, I know that ending well.Besides La La Land, Before Midnight has the most realistic couple fight I've ever seen, it ebbs and flows, and that entire segment harks back to Linklater's little-seen experiment Tape. It's a deep, deep character study and I hope dearly that they make another one and commit to film another era in two people's lives that we rarely see with this clarity and honesty.",Before Midnight
68,Angeneer,"A worthy sequel, only wish we had less outsiders",9,22 June 2013,"I admit I am a huge fan of the Before series. I was eagerly anticipating this movie for many years. Since 2004 to be exact. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have hands down the best chemistry in the history of cinema. I am not exaggerating. Their interaction and mannerisms along with the masterfully crafted dialogues should be obligatory material in acting schools.So again this time, when they were on screen they managed to perfectly convey the joys, concerns and frustrations of people (and also couples) in their early 40s, just like they did with the early 20s and early 30s in the other two films. Their acting calibre allows them to stay on the fine line between maturity and insecurity.This leads me to the only issue I have with the film and the reason I gave it a 9. Unlike the previous two installments, a lot of screen time is wasted in conversations with or between third parties. I was simply not interested in what everyone else had to say, this is a movie about Jesse and Celine and how they see life through their own eyes. Thankfully the issue is rectified in the second half, but I still wanted to enjoy our two protagonists a bit more. I could even go as far as saying some parts especially in Patrick's table border to corny and bland, but without using spoilers this may actually be intentional.A side comment: I may not think her role (or any supporting role for that matter) was key to this particular movie but as a Greek it was a delight to see the beloved Xenia Kalogeropoulou again on screen after so many years of absence. She has aged gracefully. Please check her movies, she is an extremely skilled actress. Now in terms of the location, as with the rest of the films, it is really secondary. I'm not sure why they chose Greece in the first place, but in any case Southwestern Peloponnese is a great place to visit and actually using the house of Patrick Leigh Fermor is a fitting homage to the great traveller (the host's name being Patrick surely not a coincidence). As mentioned above, the movie really takes off in the second half, the hotel scene and the very last scene are pure Oscar material (hello Academy, you skipped them twice, it is about time don't you think?). Intense magnetism was emitted from the screen and nobody really wanted this movie to end. I could easily sit a few more hours watching them interact.Once more, thank you Ethan, Julie and Richard for giving us another amazing film. I know I will be revisiting again and again.",Before Midnight
69,chuck-reilly,"""Before Midnight"" is absolutely awful",3,15 June 2013,"Patrick Swayze once said ""You ain't seen bad yet, but it's comin'."" He must've been able to see into the future and caught a late-night screening of this travesty. There aren't enough negative adjectives to describe ""Before Midnight""---but I'll try. You can't really complain about the plot in this film because there isn't one. A better title for this two-hour gas-fest would be ""The Nitpickers"" because that just about sums up this movie in a nutshell. The two hours of torture that Ms. Delpy and Mr. Hawke put themselves through is only matched by the suffering of the audience. Viewers hoping for any type of distraction from the ""action"" between the two leads will be disappointed. The bickering and arguing continues nonstop throughout the entire screen time without any respite. But viewers at least can walk away from this experience and realize what level of talent it takes to actually make a good movie, whether it be a comedy or a drama, because there is positively none exhibited here. There was no sense of ""reality"" here either, despite what some earlier reviewers raved about. In fact, ranting and raving has everything to do with the interchange between Delpy and Hawke. They cover a lot of ground on a variety of subjects, but end up saying nothing significant about any of them. Their conversations give new meaning to the word ""pretentious."" If two people like this actually existed, they would've killed themselves or each long before they ever took a vacation to a Greek island. These folks don't need a marriage counselor; they need loaded pistols at twenty paces. Depending on one's point of view, either Delpy or Hawke could easily win the award for most aggravating person ever in a film. I would cast my vote for Delpy simply because her nerve-wracking incessant whining will never be duplicated (not that anyone in their right mind would want to duplicate it). And this is a trilogy? It's more like three strikes and you're out. Heaven help the film industry if this movie in any way portends its future. To put it bluntly, unless you're a certified masochist, avoid this horror-show at all costs. You will never get these two hours of your life back. But I must give some praise for one thing the director (he will remain anonymous in this review) and his two stars (Delpy and Hawke) had the guts to do. They actually put their names on the credits.",Before Midnight
70,diac228,A cold yet beautiful epilogue of a flawless love story,10,17 June 2013,"The ultimate goal of the storyteller is to leave the listener or listeners thirsty for more.Before Midnight accomplishes just this, and for the third time in the indie darling series.This dramatically beautiful film follows the lives of two characters that avid moviegoers have come to know about and love for the past two decades. Taking place nine years after the spectacular Before Sunset, Before Midnight is exactly what it looks like when a magical love story's happily ever after begins to show its age. It doesn't have the majesty or the warmth of the previous two movies, as it's instead infused with brutal realism and a more conflicting blend of optimism and pessimism.Written by the same trio of Julie Delpy, Ethan Hawke and the great director Richard Linklater, this third installment continues using the same formula of excellent dialogue and whimsical cinematography combined with flawless acting. Ethan Hawke's best performances have come from this series, as he combines confidence with fragile hidden vulnerability in a way that delivers nothing but sympathy from the audience. And then there's Julie Delpy, whose subtle angst is mixed with an incredible dosage of charm and sexuality that you just won't find in most actresses modern day. They both deserve Oscar nominations, they honestly do.Breathing life into the performances that transforms these characters into seemingly living and breathing people is the breathtaking writing, which never feels forced, never feels sugar-coated, and never feels like it was written first but instead spoken first and then translated into a script. And to top it off we have an accomplished director that has spent nearly two decades making this trilogy giving the movie all the necessary pacing, minimal movement, and breathing room to keep us engaged.In all honesty, I usually can't do films that just focus on dialogue and nothing more. But with the right characters, the right story, and the ability to keep you engaged, keep you guessing, keeps you begging for more, even a simple movie about two people in love just talking can become the most beautiful of films. And Linklater has done it three times with the same two characters—and this will become one of the most underrated accomplishments in the history of motion pictures, I can guarantee it.Before Midnight will make you laugh, will make you cry, will make you think, will make you frustrated, and will leave you discussing everything that you had just witnessed in the previous 108 minutes. And this is why this movie will stand tall as one of the best in this entire year.",Before Midnight
71,shawneofthedead,"The most romantic, realistic movie you'll see this year.",9,5 February 2014,"Romantic movies don't often warrant sequels. After all, when everything has been wrapped up with a happy ending, there doesn't seem to be much point in revisiting a love story already told. Not so with Before Midnight, Richard Linklater's absolutely delightful addition to what has become a trilogy of tender, intensely romantic films about falling - and staying - in love in the real world.We first met Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) eighteen years ago in Before Sunrise, when they were idealistic young adults who meet by chance on a train bound for Vienna. Theirs is a story of first love, rash and impulsive and unexpectedly deep for how brief it is. Nine years later, their tale is picked up again in Before Sunset, in which the long-separated couple meet and spend a brief afternoon together in Paris. Jesse is now an author promoting a novel inspired by his one short night with Celine. We soon discover that they are both not particularly happy about where they are in life.Before Midnight reprises their story nine years later, and unfolds in much the same style as the first two films. Jesse and Celine talk, bicker, argue and flirt their way across an idyllic European city: this time, they are spending the summer on the sun-washed beaches of Greece with their two beautiful twin girls. Surely this is their happy ending... except it becomes clearer as Jesse and Celine take us on a walking tour of Greece that all is not well between them. While Jesse struggles with separation anxiety over his teenage son from his first marriage, Celine frets about whether to take a government job.What works so wonderfully well about this series of films is the opportunity it affords viewers to accompany Jesse and Celine on their journey through life. The moral of their love story is that there isn't really one happy ending: certainly not the kind that ties up many a more formulaic romantic comedy. While Before Sunrise was soaked in a deeply sweet romanticism, as befitting the first rush of young, impetuous love, Before Sunset and Before Midnight are far grittier and more realistic in their portrayal of a relationship underscored by tremendous depth of feeling and affection - even if the two individuals involved are currently not entirely happy with themselves or each other.As with the first two films, it takes a while for Before Midnight to find its groove. The story is being told, slowly and surely, in the squeeze of a hand or the way Jesse reacts to a joke that Celine takes half a step too far. But it requires patience and emotional investment of its viewers. The lunch table conversation at the beginning of the film is a little dry and arch, and takes too much away from what really makes the trilogy so special: its pair of utterly mismatched characters who are nevertheless perfect for each other.Quite unlike the cookie-cutter protagonists of many a standard rom-com, Jesse and Celine both possess strong, definitive, prickly personalities. They are very real, very smart people with their own silly foibles and irrational desires - people who must compromise and swallow doubts and resentments to make a life together. If the first film was about falling in love and the second about rediscovering it, this third installment is about staying in love. There's a bittersweet joy to watching them lash out at each other, bound as they are by a deep, evident affection that may nevertheless not be enough to carry them through to the end. Both Hawke and Delpy deliver outstanding performances. Like their characters, they have developed fine lines and lost the rosy bloom of youth over the past eighteen years. But beyond looking the part, they function as actors in much the same way as their characters relate to each other: loving, giving, sharing, with a spark and chemistry that defies explanation. Delpy, in particular, bares (almost) all in a memorable scene in a hotel room that manages to be intensely awkward, real and intimate, all at the same time.By the time Jesse and Celine settle down by the sea for the film's final scene, Before Midnight has taken them - and their audience - on an emotional journey both heartbreaking and inspiring. For all the pyrotechnics and special effects that money can buy, nothing really beats the electric charge of a pair of actors thoroughly relishing and giving life to a fantastic script. Before Midnight is one of a very few fine, smart films that manages to make the mundane deeply, truly magical and romantic.",Before Midnight
72,The_late_Buddy_Ryan,Wandering Around Bullshitting—Part Trois,9,25 May 2014,"Nine years after we saw them last, dream-fantasy lovers Jesse and Celine are turning out to be a lot more like the rest of us—touchy and temperamental, obsessed with aging, brooding about career frustrations (Celine) and parental sins of omission (Jesse). They can still keep each other entertained (me too, I'm glad to say) just ""wandering around bullshitting,"" as Jesse says at one point, but their nonstop banter has an edge to it now, all leading up to a climactic scene that's both disturbing and fascinating. The locations are as camera-ready as ever—a gorgeous villa in southern Greece amid picturesque ruins from various eras—and Linklater's unsurpassed (except maybe by Mike Leigh on a very good day) at creating plot and character through long barrages of natural-sounding dialogue. Some of the war-between-men-and- women riffs in an extended dinner party scene may seem dated (""Was this movie made about sixty years ago?,"" my wife asked), and though the characters have a lot to say about the passage of time and our perceptions of it, there's nothing here as perceptive or as provocative as some of the best stuff in ""Waking Life."" Otherwise it's all good, with the proviso that I'd recommend watching the first two entries in the ""Before"" series first; it's possible to piece the backstory together, but there's a lot going on in this amazing film, and all three, IMHO, are really worth seeing.",Before Midnight
73,jackasstrange,Just as great as its predecessors,9,22 January 2014,"Before Midnight is the last chapter of that wonderful and vastly underrated trilogy named 'before'. And certainly it finished with a golden key. Just like in the others installments, there is a lot of talking, and generally about banal and apparently small things, but that's really what is great about it. After all, 'the minor details are the most important'. The goal of these films is to show life in its minor details, it captures the gestures, the expressions, and as I already said, minor moments of life, like the table conversation in a vacation sunny day, that is apparently a event like any other but tells much more about the story than probably any fight or discussion. A great scene and perhaps the most romantic part of the film come in the end, at the climax, when the couple is discussing about their relationship, under the moon's lightning, at midnight. That scene was one of the greatest that I've seen, or at least, one of the most memorable. That film really impressed me, even more than the previous ones, and I must say it's the best of the whole trilogy. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy acting are greater than in the other two films, and they dare a lot more than in the last installments. In a short resume, the content in this film has more discussions about sexual life, has more swearing, and in fact, is the 'strongest', if that is the word. But the goal still the same, it shows life how it is, again, if you like films full of details and that don't skip anything, you'll love this film, just like I do. An extremely original, instigating, and well told story. There isn't really that much to talk about the film, it needs to be seen. 9.0/10",Before Midnight
74,whatch-17931,Realistic I suppose but a let down,4,18 February 2021,"Celine seems extremely unhappy while Jesse seems hunky dory.Frankly, this seemed inevitable, because real life. The first two movies were short to extremely short flings. I liked Before Sunset the best though I'm not sure I've was convinced of Jesse being a writer. But it didn't really matter since it functioned as a plot device to kick off the plot.It definitely gets hard to like these people. Jesse dumped his wife for his French girl and Celine just hates everything.I'm also rather unconvinced Jesse would have left his first wife. I can see them having a fling after Before Sunset, but it seems a bit hard to believe he would have left her considering the chaos this would cause their son, especially considering Jesse's rather relaxed personality.",Before Midnight
75,akash_sebastian,Linklater's Third Part in the 'Before Trilogy' is More Real and Brutally Honest,8,5 August 2013,"This is Richard Linklater's third part in the 'Before' series, and it's set 9 years after Jesse and Celine meet again in Paris during his book tour. It surely needs a lot of innovation and talent, both from the director and actors, to successfully and elegantly tell a story of two lives in the form of three movies, all set 9 years apart, each in the span of a day. Over these 18 years, we feel like we've grown with Jesse and Celine, and their lives are so intimately etched with ours.This part is set in a Greek village, and seems more real and brutally honest. It gives an intrusively intriguing glimpse into the couple's life, nine years into their relationship. We see a happy but disgruntled couple; regrets, kids, hopes, dreams... all these seep in. Sometimes, the depth and intimacy of the their conversations and arguments feel too private for us to even be there.The acting from the two leads is exceptional without a doubt. Hawke and Delphy have worn these characters along the years almost as their second skins. In this part, we see a completely new side. All the pent up regret and rage makes them confront each other with such aggression and sarcasm. Love is not completely lost between them; as long as they're communicating, we still see some kind of hope.The first scene of the movie, where we see Jesse seeing off his son (from first wife) at the airport, and the hotel confrontation scene are exquisitely executed and brilliantly acted. Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick ['The Omen', 'Moonrise Kingdom'], the young actor who plays Jesse's son Hank, is quite talented and surprisingly charming.The movie ends on a pleasing and magical note. An unforgettable and unmatched love trilogy.",Before Midnight
76,rlaine,"To the bitter end, not a very rewarding finale",6,29 August 2014,"I saw Before Sunrise when it was new and being about the same age as Jesse, meeting new people, traveling around Europe by train and being even an art student, I could very well relate to the movie. Loved it very much. It really affected me.I thought I had seen Before Sunset, but after watching this latest Before Midnight, I'm not sure if I ever actually saw the second movie or just read about it. I didn't really remember (or know) what had happened 10 years ago so it took a while for me to get in track, why were they in Greece, whose children were they, did they get married at some point, did they divorce at some point and who? In the beginning there's a long drive where Jesse and Celine babble away, but you can't really say whether they have been married for 10 years or if they're a fairly new couple. Even tho well acted and maybe improvised, I'm not sure how realistic this was. It feels a bit shallow compared to the first movie.Like the first movie, this also consists mostly of talking. There's now a dinner table conversation with more people involved. That too is very well acted and scripted, but still the real relationship between Jesse and Celine is left somewhat cold.The movie then moves to it's finale, where Jesse and Celine are having a parents night out, children taken care by the other guys. They take a long walk again and go to a hotel where they're supposed to spend a romantic evening. But it all goes sour. The latter half of the movie is pretty much arguing that's not exactly fun to watch. At times you feel the situation is fixable, but eventually things go beyond the point of recovery - at least in my mind. They go to territory you don't go to in a normal argument. Things are said that can't be taken back.Still the movie ends in a relatively positive note, only it didn't feel realistic to me and left a very sour taste in my mouth. After all the arguing, I can't see things change back that easily. It's true that many of the events and the arguments preceding are somewhat realistic. What begins quite well in the hotel is quickly turned around by one phone call and a few wrong words. After that it's back to arguing and the mood is gone. That's how it may very well go.Like many have written, it's difficult to agree with Celine. She's just bitter and mean. Jesse on the other hand just keeps trying to crawl back and please her. Where as the first movie was something you'd definitely like to experience yourself as a young adult, this movie is something that you wouldn't want to experience as a forty something couple. There's the difference. It can be argued if this was a realistic movie or not - that depends on the viewer, but I can't see anyone actually wanting to be in the situation Jesse and Celine are in this movie.It's such a shame that a unique trilogy and movie romance without comparison ends in such a bitter way.",Before Midnight
77,ivanmessimilos,Best of trilogy,8,11 June 2021,"An impressive and interesting concept for shooting a trilogy, one film every nine years. For me personally, this is the highest quality film. Many fans of the first two parts resent the third for being a little different, but that's exactly why it's the best for me. Before Midnight is a real, realistic and life film. There is no romance, but that is why there are problems and conflicts. Infatuation has a shelf life, it is fleeting, blurs vision, idealizes, hides the flaws of the other, and emphasizes virtues. True love is for a lifetime, with many struggles, fears, obstacles, bad days, but one goes through it all in communion. As the saying goes, in both good and evil. Acting is also the best from the trilogy, but I think that on the one hand it is expected because the actors themselves are older, more experienced, then they are better. I have to say that Ethan Hawk was great and rich to me, both in talent and visually, the man looks great and I'm confident enough that I can say that without a problem. Julie Delphy is also great in her role, certainly the best actress in the entire trilogy. The conflict is masterfully made because there is no right and wrong side, they both have their arguments and can understand them. Otherwise I think the movies are great connected, a lot of attention was paid to the links and details.",Before Midnight
78,ArmandoManuelPereira,"Heart Wrenching and Intense, And Possibly The Best Of The Three Before Films",8,4 August 2020,"All of the Before films are good, but Before Midnight, which I have seen twice now, seems the best of them all. Certainly more intense and heart wrenching. Heart wrenching because many of us have come to love these characters and their beautiful Hollywood-like romance. So when that romance begins to disintegrate, part of us doesn't wish to accept it. While another part of us embraces the inevitability of it all. The movie is essentislly 5 scenes, which are all dialogue driven. Each one is fascinating, but my favorites were the lunch scene and the one in the hotel room. I personslly feel that the Director has created a unique document with these three movies, and think a fourth film will be needed.",Before Midnight
79,eldreddsouza,Very close to Reality but Reality can often be disappointing.,7,22 April 2021,"As a huge fan of the first two films, Before Sunrise and Before Sunset for their very realistic portrayal of a love story, I was hoping this film to be realistic as well.It did not disappoint in that regard. It's very well manages to show what relationships turn into after a while. In that respect I admire this trilogy for showing nothing superficial and sticking to reality. But that doesn't mean you will enjoy this film very much. That's the problem with reality. It is often disappointing.So if you loved the first two films and are happy with the way the last film ended and don't wish to see what couples turn into after spending years and years with each other, stay away. You'll be disappointed. This shows why so many marriages around the world in today's day and age end in divorce. At least it gives you a fair idea. You won't be missing out if you skip this one and you want to imagine your own ending for this trilogy.If you don't mind watching your favourite characters go down the road you might have expected them to go, based on realistic portrayal of relationships of course, or if you don't mind a sad ending, you may go ahead and watch this film. You'll love it.",Before Midnight
80,GirishGowda,One of the more fascinating trilogies in the world of cinema,7,11 November 2013,"Nine years after the conclusion of Before Sunset, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Céline (Julie Delpy) are a couple and parents to twin girls conceived when they got together for the second time. Jesse is also struggling to maintain his relationship with his teenage son, Hank (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick), who lives in Chicago with Jesse's ex-wife and who, after spending the summer with Jesse and Céline on the Greek Peloponnese peninsula, is being dropped off at the airport to fly home. Jesse has continued to find success as a novelist, while Céline is at a career crossroads, considering a job with the French government.Its a treat to watch Celine and Jesse again. Maybe its because of the fact that I watched all three movies within a short time frame, but this didn't have the magic and charm of the first two movies and it has nothing to do with realism. The focus on the other characters was mundane, while the fights that our lead characters, though true to themselves, came off as a plot device more than anything. But, I still enjoyed it a lot and the insight the arguments provided were intriguing since I thought that neither one was wrong or right and it was age and normal routine stuff taking a toll on them this time around. This trilogy is one of the more fascinating cinematic experiments. Richard Linklater's third and final (?) rumination on romance is one of the most mature and realistic depictions of long term relationship. I hope Linklater makes another sequel... in nine years.7/10",Before Midnight

82,ivko,Coming full circle,9,14 November 2013,"I should start by saying that I might include some spoiler-ish stuff in this review. Nothing major, but I will reference a couple of plot points that, if you are really spoiler adverse, you may want to avoid reading.I loved this movie. I love the whole series, actually. All of them, Before Midnight included, are just so well thought out and acted, not to mention the incredibly gorgeous cinematography. I suppose that it helps that I'm only slightly younger than Ethan Hawke, so many of the life milestones explored in the movies are occurring around the same time in my life, but I think viewers of any age will find a lot to love here. As with the previous two films, Before Midnight is essentially a character piece that plays out as a series of conversations without any real ""action"", so I'll put my standard disclaimer here that if you are an adrenaline junkie kind of person who wants big, exciting, heart-pounding thrill rides, this may not be the film for you.Before Sunrise explored love and youth, Before Sunset the beginning of what I like to refer to as ""true"" adulthood, and Before Midnight brings us to the beginning of middle age and family. On the surface, all three movies explore the relationship between the two main characters, Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy). But the writing is deep enough that it offers up a slice of something deeper. In Before Sunrise when we meet Jesse and Celine, we get a glimpse into the magic and the foolishness of youth. The existential angst of not knowing who or what we want to become, the wide-eyed idealism that allows us to believe that truly anything is possible, and the extreme honesty of always living in the moment. In Before Sunset we see how age has started to gel us into what we will be, good and bad. We've loved and learned, hurt others and been hurt, and we are more guarded with our heart. And now with Before Midnight we get to explore middle age with Jesse and Celine.And this is where, in a sense, we have come full circle. If Sunrise was partly about Jesse and Celine's youthful honesty, Midnight is about the secrets and fears they are harboring in their hearts. Some viewers might believe that putting ""Midnight"" in the title is apt, as this movie is not about the joy of discovering love, but rather about the difficulty of maintaining it. Still, having experienced some of this myself and having many friends who have gone through it, I guess I would say that I don't feel it's dark so much as just plain old difficult. Love, as it turns out, is a tricky thing.Orson Welles once said ""If you want a happy ending, that depends, of course, on where you stop your story."" You see, movies and books and even our own fantasies like to think of love as a firework burst. The sky is dark and then, BANG! A beautiful cascade of color and sparks lights up the night as we watch, mouths agape, at the wonder of it all.And that is what love is like, or rather a facet of love. But lasting love, the kind that lasts after the sky has faded again, is a different beast all together. That kind of love is more akin to later in the show when the smoke from previous explosions begins to obscure the sky and some of the bursts are repeats where you say ""Well I've seen that one already."" And you start to notice that it's getting cold and the bugs are really starting to eat you alive. You start to think that maybe you should pack it up and get back to the car before the crowd starts clogging up the roads and asking ""do we really need to see the rest of this?""This is where we find Jesse and Celine. Throughout the entire film I never had a moment of doubt about their love for one another, no matter what they were saying. The truth of their feelings was shown with perfect simplicity in the first minutes of the film during a car ride. But the smoke of their lives is beginning to obscure the truth of their feelings. Jesse is grappling with an unpleasant truth that due to choices he's made certain opportunities have gone and will never come back. That he's gained so much in exchange is a fact he's lost sight of, and his regret triggers a deep, almost paralyzing fear in Celine that a happiness so profound she can't even express it could suddenly be taken away from her. Her response might seem odd to some, but for me it was surprisingly honest and human. Sometimes when facing the prospect of losing something very dear to us, our instinct is to get it over with. To make our worst nightmare real so that we don't have to worry about it anymore.What Jesse and Celine need is to hold on and hope. To wait for the smoke to clear so that they can see the next burst and experience that feeling of wonder again. Whether they do or not is, as with the endings of the previous films, left somewhat ambiguous. It is up to the viewer to decide if they saw that last little burst. I have my own opinion, but either way I mostly just hope they keep making these amazing films every nine years or so. I promise I will keep watching; I hope many of you will as well.",Before Midnight

84,sandnair87,All Love Stories Pale 'Before' Richard Linklater's Love Letter to Cinema!,9,7 December 2015,"Two decades after Richard Linklater's beguiling 1995 romance Before Sunrise and nine years after 2004's equally charming Before Sunset, Ethan Hawke's American writer Jesse and Julie Delpy's French environmentalist Celine are back together in Before Midnight and they are still captivating company for anyone who fell for them during their previous strolls. Now, though, they are no longer footloose bohemians but parents of angelic twin daughters, on the cusp of middle age and facing the issue most movies ignore: how to keep love alive in a long-term relationship.If your idea of a good romance is one that climaxes with a last-minute dash to the airport, then Before Midnight probably won't turn you on. The film begins at an airport - as Jesse says goodbye to his teenage son - and what ensues during the following hundred minutes is deceptively casual - the couple's chatter seemingly improvised but actually carefully scripted by the supremely talented Linklater and put on screen with subtle craft.The movie is basically a three-act play, where the first act has an extraordinary set of single takes in a car ride that features talk of children, careers, and most importantly, aging apples. Up next is an idyllic Peloponnese villa, where Jesse and Celine are stationed with a host of friends. With all of them together, especially at a dinner that I didn't want to end, we hear about different aspects of love. Then comes the final act, where Jesse and Celine are left alone as they go on an evening stroll through the Greek ruins and stone streets to a posh hotel for a romantic night alone. Taking on the familiar walk 'n talk style of the previous films, we're initially brought at ease as the two simply ramble on together about anything and everything, playful and challenging in equal measure. But upon arriving at their room for what should have been an amorous night, a simple phone call is the impetus for what is a nasty, brutal argument that sees them ripping one another to shreds on just about every level. Misunderstandings, neuroses, and pent up frustrations snowball, all but shattering the fairy tale myth of the first two films, as their intimate confidences curdles into acrimony.But if you have been with Jesse and Celine through the slips and stumbles of their romantic journey, then their long, flowing, deceptively gripping conversations ripple with the realities of life. Jesse and Celine, clearly so comfortable in their characters' skin, indulge in intelligent banter, swapping Woody Allen-esque one-liners - nicely snarky, appealingly abrasive. It's been another nine years between films, and if so much has changed in the meantime, the unparalleled chemistry between Hawke and Delpy hasn't slipped even a little. They may be older, a bit wiser, and certainly more wrinkled, but their performances are nothing less than natural throughout. Witnessing their ageing, nagging, toying love on screen is a true privilege.Before Midnight is like an old friend who has grown sharper and saltier with life; and for students of cinema, the film is a master-class in the portrayal of human nature. It's one of the most convincing and charming representations of long-term coupledom you'll ever see - a literary as well as cinematic achievement to cherish!",Before Midnight
85,CMTiago,"Words define life, Before Midnight defines movie screenplays",9,5 February 2014,"Until 2013 I had not been familiar with the Before trilogy and upon its nomination for the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar, Midnight latched on to my watch list and I'm glad it did. I wanted to watch the first two so I could have a chronological order on the story, but unfortunately couldn't and I will try as soon as possible to do so. Despite this setback, this third entry was a fantastic experience, one I hope to have with the other two films. I won't go into much detail on the story, so basically Jesse and Celine, are now a married couple with two children, who are just about finishing their summer vacation in Greece. For me I felt that the relationship Jesse has with his son, Hank, triggers the whole plot. After a complicated divorce, our two leads don't have quite the healthy relationship with Jesse's ex-wife and when Jesse brings up the possibility of moving to the U.S to be close to Hank, just as Celine is about to accept a dream job, complications will surely come into play, and as a couple they must figure out a way to survive. Filled with honesty and a sometimes cynical look at relationships, the Before Midnight script not only complements life, but also what movie scripts are supposed to do: captivate. To offer an example and despite its differences, a script I really enjoyed being brought to the big screen was Pulp Fiction, because I felt it flowed very naturally and combined with Tarantino's style and brilliant performances was a huge cinematic experience. On another note, Before Midnight is a script that isn't stylized, yet with its complexity of themes flows just as naturally and is just as entertaining. I feel like it could have racked up a couple more nods for the Oscars such as acting nominations for the leads and cinematography for the beautiful Greek landscape. Being this such a competitive year I understand, but it kind of feels like a shame for me, at least for now.Rating 9/10",Before Midnight
86,jmillerdp,Manufactured Drama,5,28 May 2015,"The second you hear their contention about possibly moving to Chicago so Hawke can be with his son, you know this is what they're going to be arguing about, on and on and on...It comes across as very manufactured, that the screenwriters were scrambling for some conflict to come up with, then run the movie through. And, it's irritating. Very irritating. Neither of these two characters are more than marginally interesting. Here, they're just stock middle-age-angst characters yammering about their problems.A movie about conversation, to me, is a thrilling idea. I love ""My Dinner with Andre"" to pieces! And, I instantly fell in love with it when I saw it as a teenager.But, this movie is just two people tearing at each other for almost two hours. Julie Delpy is particularly irritating, and just cusses and whines almost endlessly. Ethan Hawke has his hangdog quality, being a kind of endearing ne'er do well.I know these movies have lots of admirers, but to me they definitely suffer from a case of diminishing returns.***** (5 Out of 10 Stars)",Before Midnight
87,eyeintrees,"Nasty, ugly, neurotic.",4,15 February 2015,"I absolutely loved the first two movies, they were brilliant, the dialogue superb and the characters beautifully acted.This movie... whether I had seen the other two movies or not, this is one gigantic self-absorbed, miserable, passive aggressive, idiotic bowl of trash.It's a miserable ongoing droning of a woman who twists every word her husband says, blames him for everything, is paranoid beyond compare and has totally lost her bloom... indeed, can this poor guy go through another 56 years with this psycho!!! (Her question to him.) This is the kind of immature garbage that women think men should put up with. How does a 40 something woman become so baseless and immature and unsupportive of her husband... because she basically hates herself... it shows through in the first two movies, this character's phenomenal paranoid psychotic neurosis... and I've met women like her (I'm a woman and I HATE THEM...) this character shows why men RUN AWAY FROM MARRIAGE... and I don't blame them one bit.Horrible. If you loved the first two movies, PLEASE DO NOT WATCH THIS ONE... and keep the joy alive as a sweet memory of two other good movies.I REALLY wish I hadn't watched this utter garbage laden with a woman's bitchy, nasty diatribe and ongoing mean little voice. DON'T WATCH IT. HORRIBLE MOVIE.",Before Midnight
88,craig-hopton,Very watchable,7,3 August 2014,"I was aware that this is the third movie in a series but having not seen the previous two I wasn't sure what to expect other than that it was a romance that had received good reviews.The format was interesting and brave - a mere handful of scenes that revolved entirely around lengthy conversation. It's an approach that is probably more suited to the intimate confines of a theatre than to the big screen (and indeed I'm certain that it *would* make excellent theatre), but it still worked pretty well in this movie.There is much to commend. The fine performances of Ethan Hawkes and Julie Delpy make the squabbling couple believable albeit completely infuriating. The dialogue is (thank goodness) well-written if a little pretentious and over-theatrical (told you it would translate well to the theatre). And of course the setting in Greece lends itself effortlessly to the romantic theme.The thing that holds this movie back is that, despite the excellent dialogue, it is actually about nothing more than a domestic row. A row, that if it wasn't set between an American and a Frenchwoman in the southern Peloponnese would be insufferably dull. Domestic rows can make good - yes there it is again - theatre but they've been done many times before and much better by the likes of Pinter, Ibsen and numerous others.Before Midnight could not have been executed better but it is limited by its ambitions. Watchable though.",Before Midnight
89,thinbeach,Will now erase this from my memory,5,12 March 2020,"Think of the worst argument you've had with your significant other, then ask if you would pay to watch it? Before Sunrise is one of my favourite films and Before Sunset an excellent sequel, but Before Midnight kills the magic, turning Celine into a monster and having Jesse grovel at her feet. In an attempt to convey the complexity of adult relationships it practically destroys the notion of love itself, tarnishing the earlier precedent. It is overly self referential and the pseudo intellectual conversation, while performed very naturalistically, is hit and miss. Well, at least the Greek visuals are pleasant.",Before Midnight
90,JPfanatic93,"Love before midnight, bitter arguments after",7,22 September 2013,"Third installment in Richard Linklater's Before romance trilogy (for lack of an official name), that began with Before Sunrise (1995) and continued with Before Sunset (2004). We revisit the lives of Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), 18 years after their first all too brief encounter in Vienna and nine years after their second equally short sexual interlude in Paris, that left them with twin girls. Now they meet up again in Greece for vacation as an almost genuine family, which causes long simmering emotions to stir, both for good and for bad. Though they agree their life as a semi-divorced couple (they were never married to begin with) with two adorable but ever attention seeking children leaves a lot to be desired – he has problems dealing with his vicious real ex-wife and connecting to the son he sired on her, while her career is at a crossroads and as a devout feminist, she is bothered by the feeling society wants her to totally give herself to her children instead of being successful – they do still deeply care for one another as is evident when they visit Greek friends where it seems their love life is the most sweepingly romantic of all of them. However, when they are given a luxurious hotel room for one night, their differences and mutual feelings of lack take over, causing quite an argument between them. This film is quite amazing in that it's basically a few scenes of the two protagonists and a few minor characters engaging in endless conversation about ordinary things, yet it's totally compelling due to the completely believable performances, the fast paced, realistic, and often witty and snappy dialogue and the relatibility of it all as these are totally regular folks experiencing everyday problems. An education in minimalist filmmaking, each scene can take up to 20 minutes with no more editing, music or other movie trickery than needed so you can really flow with these characters. The romantic tone of the piece is underscored with a little help from the beautiful small town Greek settings and landscapes, except for the hotel scene – which takes place entirely in an ugly, modern, eerily lit boring white room – which of course is the only location where Jesse's and Celine's relationship turns into bitter strife and mutual rapprochement, until they seem to reconcile at an outdoor restaurant a little while later. The neutral zone between man and woman might as well be a battlefield for dominance, Linklater suggests, but if both parties really care for one another and aim for simple understanding, nothing can stand in the way of true love.",Before Midnight
91,FilmMuscle,A Rare Experience Still Fueled By Spontaneity and Genuineness,10,27 October 2013,"Wow, don't you just love it when there's finally a film that actually delivers on or exceeds your expectations? Before Midnight is that movie. I loved (how can I emphasize that more?) the first two (Before Sunrise and Before Sunset) so much so that I just couldn't wait to see the third installment, but there was that roaming thought of whether or not it could actually meet the quality of its predecessors. Frankly, there's so much to love in Before Midnight, and it's definitely one of the most interesting projects in cinematic history where we witness two actors aging together over two decades as each addition is produced nearly ten years after the prior one. It's an extraordinary experiment, and you just fall in love with the characters and acquire deeper knowledge of their complex personalities with every new chapter. The acting is unlike that of any other films, but I'm absolutely picking Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy as one of my favorite, if not my absolute favorite, performances of the year. As usual, their performances are amazingly organic and natural while the chemistry in their relationship is matched by no other. By the time you're finished with all three films (or even finished with one of them), you'd think they're a couple in real life, but they're sadly not. It's not only their words but their physical responses (gestures, emotions, etc.) that create this sense that they truly know each other inside out. Honestly, if I find a woman half as astonishing as Celine, I'd be a lucky and happy man. She's an incredibly cute, intelligent woman with a sexy French accent that makes heavily interesting conversation- what else could be more attractive? Jesse (played by Ethan Hawke) is an equally lovable individual who possesses an equal amount of depth- the intellectual and wise-cracking fellow! There are countless pauses and particular mannerisms that create this natural and realistic atmosphere as if you're actually viewing someone else's life rather than just watching a theatrical production. Now, I don't mean to sound condescending here, but it undoubtedly saddens me to see people (though they're obviously the minority) pan the film simply because it's primarily focused on dialogue/discussion. They're of the mentality that films have to contain consistent action and artificial relationships (that last one is more unintentional, of course), and I extremely hate the traditional mindsets that construct rules on how you write screenplays and structure your plots and stories. If cinema was as great and artistic as it was, there'd be no need for restricting visionaries to what they can and can't do. I believe that rigid standards and rules utterly cannot exist in the realm of art and storytelling. This is why we only encounter a unique and memorable film- any type of story form for that matter- every once in a while. These storytellers honestly don't care about what the bosses expect whether it's introducing a turning point exactly on page 22 in your screenplay or intentionally assembling a three-act film; it's typical, generic, and artificial at this point. With Before Midnight, there's never that hint of artificiality or inclusions of Hollywood archetypes and clichés. The viewers are basically transported into other people's lives- fully immersed- and that's essentially what stories are all about: leaving your irritating life to occasionally experience the fun and liveliness of another. The script of this motion picture is so witty and genuine that I never felt boredom out of the constant reliance on talking. Their conversations are frequently fascinating, and I just hope that I can find someone, one day, who talks about various topics, philosophical, psychological or personal, rather than gossip and more bullshit. However, I found it slightly distracting how overloaded the film was with conversations about sex in its first half; it ruined the magic of the first two in a way because Sunrise and Sunset delved into deeper discussions instead of the annoying obsession with orgasms and blowjobs that Hollywood romantic comedies and movies, in general, encompass. On another note, the cinematography can often be overlooked, but these three's excellence also stems from its visual presentation of beautiful European cities like Vienna, Paris, and Greece. You're perfectly welcome to enjoy the spectacular sights of these cities as they walk through them in real-time, debating about another compelling subject. So, when moviegoers complain about the lack of cinematic substance in these films, I can certainly refute by showing them these two sides- an immersive experience within a city, marveling over the numerous landmarks, and intriguing, spontaneous dialogue on the other side- or them both intertwining, more so. As I kept on watching, I never wished for it to end because these vibrant personalities seriously engross you, and in my opinion, the enjoyment received from these films is indescribable. You're laughing along with the characters (whether through their teasing one another or unified laughter following a clever joke) or you're worried about a developing issue in their relationship and what will come of it. In sum, you're sensing these emotions and feelings as they're sensing them. It can't be said enough, but this trilogy is unquestionably a rare feat, and I can't bear to wait another ten years for a sequel (these are one of those films where I hope the series will continue on forever and ever). Once I'm finished with the film, I can't stop thinking about it a day or two after and while I'm remarkably satisfied by the experience, I'm also upset about its conclusion. If only this were a TV series that I could return to every year, but that is unfortunately not the case here. Before Midnight is a must-see, and at the moment, it could very well be my favorite film of the year, no doubt about that. Very rarely do I finally reach a film that feels special, memorable, and fresh. I'm glad Before Midnight was that eventual encounter.",Before Midnight
92,lucasversantvoort,Engaging third entry into the Before series,8,5 May 2015,"The third part in the acclaimed Before-series of films: Before Midnight. It's one of Hollywood's indie darlings. Anyone familiar with the previous two, will note how relatable and real it all feels. This is the films' main strength and I'm pleased to report the third outing doesn't disappoint in that department nor in many others. This is a very strong movie which is all the more special since it's the third outing in the series. As you know, not many third parts (in trilogies) are particularly good The acting is still strong and feels natural, as does the dialogue, and it builds on themes from the other two films in many, interesting ways.Since the previous film ended on a cliffhanger (did Jesse stay with Celine or not?) the first thing you'll want to know is what happened. We see Jesse saying goodbye to his son at an airport. We sense a distance between the two. Jesse then walks outside toCeline talking on her cell phone. They both get in their car and drive away, but not before the camera pans to show twin daughters asleep in the backseats. We now realize that not only are Jesse and Celine together, but they also have twins in addition to Jesse's son with his ex-wife. As you'd expect, the film follows their relationship for the rest of the day, exploring its highs and lows through endless conversationsand if that sounds boring, then you have never watched a Before-film. These are conversations that are simultaneously mundane and crackling with intelligence at the same time.The people who have watched the other two films will obviously get the better audience experience, since they can note the differences (and similarities) in the way Jesse and Celine act. In Before Sunrise, they possessed the same wit you'll see in Midnight, but they were (hopelessly) romantics at the same time. In Before Sunset, the subject matter darkened a bit. Jesse was married and had a son whereas Celine had a boyfriend. In Midnight, their conversations have stayed the same time and changed simultaneously. They have become able to tease each other more skillfully, having now spent years with each other, and know how to push each other's buttons. There's a scene where Celine notes how Jesse ogles women. She's obviously worried that these are signs that Jesse is not physically attracted to her anymore. Jesse responds by joking with a Spanish (or was it Greek?) accent that he doesn't ogle them, but 'makes love to them with his eyes'. This causes laughter and voilà, the touchy subject has been skillfully swept under the rug. These kinds of details show that how they converse and what they talk about, has changed. It's ironic that Celine notes at one point that she's missed 'talking' with Jesse: now that there are no more trains or planes that one of them needs to get on, now that they have all the time in the world, the way they've talked has changed and the amount of talking has diminished.There's also a difference in terms of time which has always played a big part in these films. In Sunrise, Jesse and Celine have their own trains to catch and in Sunset, Jesse has a plane to catch. In Midnight, however, this time pressure is non-existent. This doesn't mean that everything's all right now, just that time weighs on Jesse and Celine in different ways: how they feel about growing old together, their fading looks, Jesse's worries about missing his teen son's forming years, since he lives with his ex, etc.The late Roger Ebert noted the following in his overall positive review: ""The exchanges are never less then brilliant, the jokes pop out with unmatched speed and there are no dead silences. Small wonder, then, that Jesse and Celine's conversations don't feel like real life at all. The script is as stylized as that of any classic screwball comedy -- only the zany antics are missing."" This made me shake my head in amazement for a second: 'Before Midnightnot realistic?' Then I realized of course that films could never truly risk imitating real life, since film is supposed to be a compact version of real life. As Hitchcock famously said: ""Drama is life with the dull bits cut out."" The dialogue can't be truly realistic, because it would damage the movie. If there were too many casual silences during Jesse and Celine's countless well-constructed arguments, it would take the 'zing' out of it, it would be too real. If they didn't have their jokes ready to go at a moment's notice and instead having them take more time to 'think of' the jokes (like 'real life'), the conversations would lack punch. Ebert is basically saying that real-life arguments have many pit stops, for example where the arguing couple is unable to formulate what they want to say or the many moments when one of them is unwilling to argue. This kind of 'ultimate realism' approach might be the stuff of 8-hour long slice-of-life documentaries, but it wouldn't work in a dramatic, narrative-driven film, simply because it would take too long and it would become boring quickly. A film has to 'compress' the entirety of what's happening. I can see what Ebert is saying and he has a point, but I still find Before Midnight to be highly realistic; if not in terms of conversations, then at least in terms of its many emotional truths about people in long-term relationships.",Before Midnight
93,ligonlaw,Interesting,8,9 February 2014,"This is the third installment of a love story between a French woman, played by Julie Delpy, and an American author, played by Ethan Hawke. They do a lot of walking and talking in this trilogy.The script is written, in part, by Delpy and Hawke. The French tradition of art through conversation is apparent here. The conversation covers a lot of ground, but mostly, the dialog is about relationships. There were moments when I thought that wiser people would have given each other a moment of peace, but these are intense people. There were times when the film began to swing toward ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe?"" The film never becomes that kind of sadistic cat and mouse game, but it does become very intensely psychoanalytical.This was a better film than the second one. I hope there isn't another one in the series. The first film ""Before Sunrise"" was released in 1995, about 18 years before this the third film. It was the best of the three.",Before Midnight

The first two scenes are just okay for kids to watch with parential guidance. The third sequence contains nudity so unsuitable for children.

It can be understood that they could not dive under the sheets as they would have done this when they were younger, but to stereotype men and women (though well done) look artificial.Why rate 7 and not 8? Not least because of the previous two films, which I admit I rated with 10 for each. Linklater made ​​his link later. An interesting idea, and certainly not so pretentious compared to ""A man and a woman"". Actually, to be honest, I like the director since ""Waking Life"" and now I think to dedicate the next post to that movie. But back to the topic.A bit Fellinian, with infinitely long shots and beautiful dialogues taken at once and placed in beautiful Greece, the film marks uncrossed till now nuances. How hard it is to admit to ourselves confusion, fear and misery, or even admit them to someone else. Crises of aging, maternal and paternal fears. How much creativity and strength is required in order to maintain the magic of attraction. Real things, here I think, slightly exaggerated.Beautiful Greek finale song catches us by the hand and brings us back in the garden of roses surrounding us, planets, foxes, snakes, characters and especially faith and dreams.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",Before Midnight
96,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn review,8,6 October 2013,"Before Midnight is the third, and hopefully not last, part of a serial of movies following almost exclusively two people – Jesse and Céline – and the evolution of their romantic relationship. The movies are very realistic, smart, romantic, beautiful and come out every nine years showing us how Jesse and Céline, and their relationship, have changed. In the first movie, Before Sunrise, they are twenty-year olds who meet on a train, fall in love and spend a night together talking, but decide they won't keep in touch. In Before Sunset they meet, almost by chance, nine years later and the ending is ambiguous – but it's all explained in Before Midnight.In the beginning of the movie, we find Jesse (Ethan Hawke) at the airport, escorting his son Hank (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick), who's going back to the USA, where he lives with his mother – Jesse's ex-wife. Afterwards we learn he's still with Céline (Julie Delpy), they have twin daughters and live in Paris, but are currently on vacation in Greece. They begin a little fight right away, and later in the movie they realise they're going through a serious crisis, especially since Jesse wants to move to the States to spend more time with his son and Céline, on the other hand, doesn't want to give up her life in France.Before Midnight has a Woody Allen feel to it: it takes place in a beautiful Mediterranean country, and there are many characters involved in the story, at least in the start. Particularly the scene in which they are all seated at the table, having lunch and talking looks as if it was directed by Woody. Unfortunately, this scene doesn't really work, since those conversations at lunch are badly written – you can see it's not spontaneous dialogue, it's just script those actors know by heart. And one of the things we love about the Before serial, is that it all looks incredibly spontaneous, as if you were watching two friends walking down the street and talking. This characteristic is lost in the first part of the movie, but is restored later, when our two main characters remain alone. Which inevitably makes me wonder whether the other characters were really necessary, since incorporating new characters greatly differentiates this movie from its predecessors.Still, all those characters managed to make this movie look real: since Jesse and Céline are now over forty, and have children, they aren't focused exclusively on their relationship and on each other, like they were in the previous movies. Also, the conversation at lunch is interesting, as it provides many different opinions on love, from all age groups. Actually, I consider this movie to be the most realistic of the three: love is no longer exclusively great and romantic, we realise all relationships have problems and take a lot of effort not to fall apart. Before Sunrise was all about infatuation and young, idealistic love. Before Sunset was about people who realise their lives suck and decide to change them while they're still young, thinking they will find perfection in a new relationship. Before Midnight doesn't consider love the solution to all the problems – people need to really work on their relationships in order to be happy.The climax, during which Jesse and Céline fight, is beautifully directed and, once again, very realistic. Hawke and Delpy are so good in their roles, you can't help but think they're married in real life, too. Another great thing is that, during their fight, it's very difficult to take sides even though you can identify with the characters. From a strictly technical point of view, the long takes might not be as frequent as in the previous movies, but still make Before Midnight look lovely. While the movie might seem depressing from this review, it actually isn't. Love might not be the solution to all problems, but it certainly helps resolving them when you're in a relationship. But what happens when you're insecure about everything, when memories of your great love are hidden under a big pile of secrets, unspoken words, unresolved arguments, fears, insecurities and ultimately your whole life? It's inevitable we forget our relationships' beginnings and put other people before our partners sometimes, but it's vital that, in the end, we go back to where we started, just to check how we're doing instead of destroying ourselves with irrational fears of abandonment – and I think that's the movie's message.Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",Before Midnight

This film drained me though...I mean talk about a jarring experience. Rooting for the fantasy love that the first 2 films portrayed really set me up for resentment of a scene late in the film. Everything about it was realistic and thought-provoking but it was upsetting. I'm glad the ending provided hope for the future. I believe they stay together. Love isn't perfect, but its love nonetheless and finding true love like the love Jesse and celine have is rare. I just cant see myself going back and enjoying this film nearly as much as Sunrise and Sunset. Maybe as I age, I will appreciate more aspects of the arguments presented in the film.

While Jesse still has his boyish charm, endearingly played by Ethan Hawke, the Celine character took a nose dive in this one. They made her out to be sulky and angry and somewhat fake. Julia Delpy is very talented but this one is a miss for her. The enigmatic Celine in the first movie is gone, instead now we are presented with a garden-variety resentful, know-it-all, and condescending wife, who would not let up even after repeated attempts by Jesse to calm her down and cheer her up. The Celine embodiment here is all wrong and has lost the magic of her character and their passion from the first one.

I believe in the chance and destine encounters that the world has to offer and I believe in pre destiny. That is how my serious relationships started. Like the couple who met on the train the first time, I, too met an individual in Europe. Our kisses were trapped between the closing of the trains doors. The romance purged and died. But before the death of the relationship, I traveled from Amsterdam to Germany to England to France to Pakistan to Canada. The impact of this quintessential experience broke my compromise, rather always seeking perfection, truth and the ultimate connection. Is there nobility in that? One often settles in a relationship at 40 years old. Would it be better if this couple breaks up? Would it be more honest to destroy the relationship that has all kinds of broken pieces? Or is the reality of the matter, that each individual is already a fragmented self which can no longer, if ever, be able to completely love another? Or is true ultimate love, the full transmission of completeness that restores all components of self to a complete unity, joining two people as one, as in Greek mythology, and the myth of two people cut in half, only to join each other was destiny has re-joint them through the by passing connection.",Before Midnight

101,Kicino,Realistic yet romantic everyday life of middle-aged couple,8,29 December 2013,"Of all the three episodes in this sequel, I like this one the best because it is so close to reality. I always consider Before Sunrise and Before Sunset pretentious and a bit boring because of the excess dialogue and lack of action. But Before Midnight is the opposite since all the nagging, testing and sharing are so close to reality in a real couple. This is a movie you can munch and crunch for many times. Julie Deply and Ethan Hawke are perfect in portraying Celine and Jesse, a couple we first met 18 years ago. They are so convincing in playing ordinary husband and wife dealing with daily issues of taking care of kids and doubting each other. It gets a little more complicated because Jesse has a son from a previous marriage from another country and he is not on good terms with his ex-wife. The lines are beautifully and naturally written, flowing flawlessly to bring up their struggles, conflicts and lack of quality communication which lead to a big fight in the hotel triggered by a phone call by Jesse's son.Life is especially tough for Celine who has to give up her career to raise twins (with complicated birth) and then move to live in another country. She had to deal with many problems alone when her author husband is always away for book tours which might/could turn into possible flings/affairs.But life is not easy for Jesse either, as he is torn between spending more time with his son and being with Celine and the twin girls while being away from home on business. Conversing with a woman who constantly asks hypothetical questions and setting you to failure could be frustrating; but it only shows Celine is insecure and all she needs is some assurance. The dining conversation at the Greek writer's house is interesting in showcasing different types of relationships. It paves the way of saying that basically men are selfish and arrogant – they are preoccupied with their sexual power and career while women care more about their families and sometimes have to give up their career to do that. This theme recurs in the men's conversation under the olive tree while the women cook, their friend's talk on people's reaction from coming from a coma, and the couple's fight in the hotel room recounting past grudges. Excellent script writing.There are two reasons why a couple do not talk: they know each other so well that there is no need for verbal communication; or they are sick of explaining themselves all the time. Most of us fall in the middle. The fact that Jesse and Celine are still fighting and talking is a good sign in the sense that there is still vitality within and between them, although they might not know the best way to resolve their conflicts or reconcile their discrepancies. Perhaps they were too busy to sit down and really share their feelings towards each other on a regular basis. Because if they do, they would have found that they do love each other, perhaps with doubts at times, even though they might not express it in a way the other party feels comfortable. But it is OK. Life is an ever learning process. As long as we are still alive and know we are loved, we need to explore new ways of loving others and showing them. This is exemplified in the last and romantic scene, where a patient Jesse uses his imagination and writing skills to win Celine over. It also echoes and reassures her on what she mentioned during the day of casting doubt on being old together. The setting in beautiful Greece is relaxing and offers a refreshing break from the heavy subjects they occasionally touch on. It also contrasts their hurtful and romantic past. Like Greece, their relationship is filled with history, ruins, romances conflicts, and compromises. But precisely because of these past, they become what they are today. All the intentional and unintentional hurt, with the romance, jokes will become part of our memories. Only with acceptance and understanding our past can we move forward. Like their widow friend realizes, as life progresses, our loved one stays with us even when he passed away. But as time passes, everyone and everything vanishes eventually. We are only visitors on this planet, let's seize the present and enjoy the scenery while we can before midnight sets in",Before Midnight

I couldn't finish this. It's clear from the first 40 minutes that it's a boring, self-indulgent drama about a couple of marginally-interesting people. We hear them whine and ramble on about the ephemera of their lives.This kind of movie does not work unless executed perfectly. I don't care for Woody Allen's recent work, either. Watch last year's excellent ""The Great Beauty"" if you want to see how good a ""window into the life"" kind of film can actually be.And skip ""Before Midnight"".",Before Midnight
103,YJLcool,Completes as one of the best romantic trilogy of all time,9,28 December 2013,"As Before Midnight, Sunset, Sunrise are interrelated, it's best to put all 3 three together:Before Midnight (2013)The sequel to Before Sunset and Before Sunrise, the film is a continuation of the story of Jesse and Celine after a further nine years. They've decided to be together after their encounter in the Before Sunset and have kids.This time around, they're on the last few days of a family vacation with their kids in Greece. Jesse worries about his son's wellbeing from his previous failed marriage, which triggers a relationship assessment for the couple after all these years. Once again, the screenplay is written by both the actors themselves and it is astounding. Witty, intelligent, realistic, thought provoking and occasionally humorous, they talked about family issues, work, marriage, the obligations of parenthood, the complexity that lies in long-term commitments, insecurity, struggle of feminism. In the film, Celine's feminist ideas push her to behave in ways we've not seen her do before, many of the romanticism on her have faded away since the first film. Their lives have moved on since then, life is no longer hers alone and she has make some sacrifices for their relationship to work. Their heat argument near the end of the film reveals the hidden tensions in their relationship...the fears, resentments, insecurities, loneliness throughout the years and this reflects a lot of real-life married couple problems. A truly remarkable film that's fascinating to watch. Rating: 9/10Before Sunset (2004)The story of Jesse and Celine continues again after nine years (the film is also made nine years after the first one). They didn't managed to meet each other at the Vienna train station six months after the events of Before Sunrise. Jesse, couldn't forget their fateful encounter, decided to wrote a book about them. This allows Celine to find Jesse at a bookstore in France and their conversation continues again. The dialogue is superb, even more interesting and personal as his time around, they talked about their troubled love life, politics, environmental issues...Throughout the film, they started to show their imperfections, burdened by numerous responsibilities as they talk about the mistakes they made in life and the disappointments that comes with it. The effects of aging are noticeable from their faces. This film is definitely better than the first, because it provides a more unique, personal perspective. The characters have grown and matured throughout the years. From here, it's becoming apparent that these two characters are soul mates and they were meant for each other. Interestingly, the film's dialogue are both written by the actor and actress themselves. One can't help but to assume that the two leads may have actually shared some personal conversations during the making of the film.Rating: 8.5/10Before Sunrise (1995)The story is about a young guy, Jesse and a young girl, Celine randomly meet on a train in Europe and they're both decided to spend the whole night together, talking about life and love in Vienna. As they walk around Vienna the whole night and communicating with each other, sharing their personal life experiences, you can see a deep connection slowly formed between them. The two lead actors, Ethan and Julie, shared a perfect chemistry together on screen.The script for the film is magnificent as the dialogues managed to keep the audience engaged throughout the film.Their conversations about love provides a lot of insights about relationships.They share their views, thoughts, perspectives of anything...and as they speak, you feel that you started to know these characters as well. The film successfully captures the beauty of youthful love, two beautiful people meet in a romantic setting and attracted to each other.Rating: 8/10Overall: Linklater, together with Ethan and Julie, had crafted the one of the best romantic drama trilogy of all time.The films features an in- depth look into the characters, their life experiences and how it affects their love life...of being together.The films allow us to see one woman and one man changes over the course of time. Note: Keep in mind though, the films are dialogue driven and spend most of the time on the conversations between the leads, how they managed to find a connection between them, share their thoughts, views, perspectives, principles in life...If you find that two people communicating is not enjoyable, then it's not recommended to watch the trilogy.But it'll be incredibly rewarding if you do.",Before Midnight
104,pamma09,#3 is excellent,10,16 June 2013,"I have been waiting or this movie to be released and it did not disappoint me. Listed in my top movies has been Before Sunrise and Before Sunset - I love the premise of the ongoing conversation. The growth of the characters in the three movies is so true to life. Now they are together, not married and the parents of twin girls. Many issues in their lives - wanting to be more involved in his son's life, a new job for her with someone she did not like prior, and bringing up the old issues of things in the past. I love the ongoing conversation - slightly jealous of it. My favorite scene is the dinner table of the eight adults - all different ages and perspectives - I could watch this scene over and over. The conversation never ends - it is full of love, genuine caring for each other and their children and then angry and accusatory, and then commitment. I really hope they make another in 9-10 years - and then I hope I am around to see it. The writing is excellent, the photography is beautiful - the story ongoing.",Before Midnight

106,pcrprimer,Delpy and Hawke create the same magic on screen as the previous movies,8,22 January 2014,"It is difficult to imagine that it has almost been 10 years since Before Sunset was release. However, Delpy and Hawke seamlessly fall back into the characters that were originally developed nearly 20 years ago. The dialog is fluid and engaging between the co-leads. The long continuous shots also make it seem as if the viewer is walking with the main characters in Greece. I recall that I also thought that the previous movies would sometimes lose steam towards the middle, and this was no different. I must say that Celine's arguments seemed a bit irrational, but I'm curious if my male brain is the cause of that bias. Regardless, it was still a very enjoyable movie and I liked the ambiguous ending that leaves the door open to a potential sequel in the future.",Before Midnight

I would have dug a tunnel through the concrete on the floor to escape this poorly written trash, but my wife would have been angry so I sat through it, binging on popcorn and finding every excuse I could to exit the theater. On the positive side, I have improved my urinary tract health by consuming and ridding myself of 4 liters of water inside of two hours. The $16 I paid for the water was well worth the 8-10 minutes of relief I got from this film but I hope the theater recycles the bottles so I don't feel so guilty.

The first one is the first part of this movie is too long from the host to their friends having lunch frankly the whole scene just tell us 2 things which is the Greek host invited them and and the two other friends give them a hotel room you do not need that amount to tell a scene which leads to nothing or even unrelated to what is going on the second part
Secondly Is Celine semi nudity is also not necessary to the scene at all which really put her character down in a way
It's because of this two I'm re rating it to 9
It's almost a perfect ending to the trilogy
I'm actually looking forward to the fourth instalment soon 2022 coming soon haha",Before Midnight
109,cleary-joshua,"Once again, it's nine years later...",9,31 October 2013,"Once again it's nine years later, and we rejoin Jesse and Céline as they continue their lives, this time on holiday in Greece. They've got two children, and they're very different people from when we first met them 18 years ago. They argue more, their views of life are different, and yet the same characters that we met in ""Before Sunrise"" are still visible there. Jesse is still a romantic, stuck in his writing, and Céline is still confident and opinionated. The only other thing that's really changed is that they look older. It's these qualities that makes ""Before Midnight"" so watchable. It fills us in on the lives that these two have lead since our last meeting with them, and we can instantly reconnect with them.The opening scene shows Jesse putting his son on a plane back to the US, where he lives with his mum. It's a really touching scene, as we see the connection that he has with his son, and how difficult it is for them to part ways. It eases us into the film, because as soon as he leaves the airport, there is Céline in the car, and there the conversation begins. The film, as with both of the previous parts, is very focused on conversation. It's new and old talk, occasionally referring to things they've discussed with us before, but also with new problems. Céline's been offered her dream job, Jesse wants to move to the US to be with his son more. More than before, we see the arguing that takes place, and while it's slightly overlong and difficult to watch in places, it adds a sense of realism to the couple who were once only romantic.The film is not all serious and loud arguing though, and there are a lot of great scenes with long walks and discussions about life and love, with some really funny lines too. New people are allowed in the perpetual chat for once, and the scenes where the men and women are talking separately have some great lines. It is, as always, through this conversation that we see the true talents at work. The acting is flawless, and Julie Delpy's performance is especially powerful in places, as she manages to unleash some very real emotions. Ethan Hawke plays Jesse really well, and his treatment of the final scene manages to be both touching and funny. The characters are so well developed that it all works seamlessly, and the writing is as sharp as ever. Richard Linklater once again manages to capture the charm of the location and a beautiful realism in the two main characters.It doesn't quite reach the heights of ""Before Sunrise"", the ultimate love story, but is just as good as ""Before Sunset"", and allows us another brief glimpse into this couple's journey. I would not be at all disappointed if they decided to make a fourth part in nine more years, because if they can make a trilogy as perfect as this is, another chapter should not be difficult to pull off at all.",Before Midnight
110,vishaal811,The Best of The Before Trilogy,10,27 June 2015,"Before Midnight deviates from the romance that was presented in the two preceding movies. It is also the only movie that does not take place in a 24 hour time period. Before Sunrise and Before Sunset were both similar in how they focused on love at first sight and the rekindling of an old romance respectively. This movie starts 9 years after the ending of Before Sunset. Jesse and Celine are married and are living in Paris with two twin daughters. They are on a holiday in Greece where Jesse has to let go of his son, who came to spend his summer there and now has to return to USA. The best thing about the Before Trilogy is that the events that are taking place in the movie don't feel pretentious or fake. Richard Linklater has the gift of directing movies which are incredibly realistic and one reason for that is that the actors are given the freedom to express themselves and hence the emotions are natural. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are jointly credited for the screenplay along with the director. Both of them give astounding performances and the changes that have occurred in them is accurately portrayed. The fight scene in the hotel is wonderfully constructed and masterfully executed by Julie Delpy in particular. Well, what we can take away from this movie is that no love story, no matter how romantic it may seem at first, is perfect or immune to a break up. The realism that is shown will surely not make you feel like you are watching a movie, but our own lives that might be unfolding before our eyes.",Before Midnight
111,hkauteur,HK Auteur Review - Before Midnight,9,20 August 2013,"For the first time after the first two films, in Before Midnight we finally get to see Jesse and Celine actually in a relationship. Ethan Hawke in a press interview on KCRW's The Treatment recalled a behind-the-scenes story of how the steadi-cam operator got upset shooting a scene where Jesse gazes upon a young girl in a bikini, stating that Jesse would never do that to Celine. This to me is particularly noteworthy. As the audience, we feel like we know Jesse and Celine intimately.I'll give you an example. From having watched Jesse and Celine converse for two films now, I love that I am familiar with all their little ticks and peccadilloes. I know Celine hides her face with her long hair when she's uncomfortable and that she hates it when Jesse interrupts her romantic fancies with realism. I know Jesse likes getting his money's worth and often changes the subject when he doesn't want to talk about something. These characters mean something to us, whether we value how real they seem or romanticize their would-be relationship from the last two films. The things they do and say have a more profound effect on us as an audience. Richard Linklater understands this and uses it to his advantage.Never does it feel like Hawke or Delphy are acting. They just are these characters. I don't know if it's because they're the writers of their own dialogue, their mutual camaraderie with each other and director Richard Linklater or all of the above. There's a magic that's still present after all these years. I use the word ""magic"" because I can't pinpoint its mechanics. But when Jesse and Celine get talking, it feels like it's happening right before me.The conversations are the spectacle. On the surface, the characters are just telling interesting stories or giving their 2 cents on a given topic, but the conversations are designed with multiple arcs, callbacks and continually suggest and build character. The group dinner scene is a lot of fun and I found myself wanting to chime in and give my two cents on various topics. The climatic hotel scene is an impressive dialogue set piece, and it accurately captures how couples fight. They're both fighting to stop themselves from having the last word but it just erupts and everything comes out.If you haven't seen the first two, I'd suggest go seeing them first. Before Midnight does work as a standalone film, but watching it standalone will cut off the journey of these two characters. By default, this third film would just mean less. This is a good third movie. I cannot help but see all three films as one story now. I almost don't want to see a fourth film.Unlike a lot of love stories where it concentrates on the pursuit of love, Before Midnight refreshingly focuses on the means to sustaining a relationship. It's never tonally bitter or cynical. The film celebrates love by just presenting the simple truth, which includes the full spectrum of the sour, bitter and sweet. I love that Richard Linklater is using these iconic characters to say something profound about love, relationships and life in your forties. It's a risky move considering where the second film left off, but he accomplished it beautifully and delivered a earnest message. I was scared, touched and at the end I felt like I saw two old friends and learned something.For more reviews, please visit my film blog at http://hkauteur.wordpress.com/",Before Midnight

113,warthogjump,A wonderful taste of married life,10,14 October 2019,"What a beautiful portrayal and fantastic ending to a magnificent couple!!Moving on from being young sweet hearts in Before Sunrise to confused adults in Before Sunset, we now get a taste of experienced and mature lovers.This trilogy is without a doubt the best fictional, but realistic love story ever told in the history of cinema. Considering that the first and second films were about falling in love and confirming that love, the third film is about maintaining that love.Before Midnight is just another day with the beautiful Celine and Jeese. No doubt, nine years on their relationship has had its ups and downs. Even with our most loved ones, we sometimes have difficulties communicating and this can cause undue stress on both people. Before Midnight is about love again, but in this film the love is much deeper as it doesn't evolve from initial spark or long lost lust, but it evolves from resolving differences and conflict. We all have different personalities and to be closest with your romantic partner means there will sometimes be clashes, but in the end love will mean you are each willing to compromise to continue having moments just like that initial spark.Before Midnight can deliver this message with powerhouse performances by both Hawke and Delpy in what is a very believable romantic fairytale, quite possibly the best trilogy about love: what it means to fall in love; to sacrifice for love; and to compromise for love, because love is what inspires true selflessness.",Before Midnight
114,nikashvili,"Best of ""Before""",8,14 July 2013,"The third ""before"" of Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke happens before midnight, just nine years after Before Sunset. Jesse and Celine are now living together parenting twin girls. They live in Paris, having vacations in Greece. Jesse tries to stay in touch with his only sun from previous marriage who actually lives with mom in the US. Before Midnight is bit different movie from two previous installments. Both of them were as young and frivolous giddy films alike to their main characters, passionate and impulsive, carrying all characteristic of romantic comedy. But this one is more wise movie showing a middle age relationship between a loving couple, the ups and downs of their love and it gives a brilliant look where a desperate love can come to. Before Midnight brings questions that any couple may come up with. On the one hand they are living a great life. Jesse is a successful writer happily living with Celine. But there is something he is missing. Celine feels like she loses connection with him and destroying a decade relationship for no reason. Movie is very sincere, openly discussing lots of interesting and everyday problems. It actually consists of couple major dialogues that clearly expose whole spirit of plot. There is a dining scene where character discuss their first sexual intercourse or just their sex live and I was surprised how precise, natural and nice each word was. It did not ""scream"" as it happens in most of films. Each and every other dialogue was a masterpiece, very quiet, peaceful and calmly emotional. The last scene in the bedroom which actually last half an hour, just runs very quickly because of beautifully written script.Julie & Ethan wrote the screenplay with director Richard Linklater, and they did it even better then before. Everything in the movie speaks for itself - Delpy and Hawke knew what they were doing. There is no much dramatic action or emotional plays in Before Midnight. On the contrary it's very calm and steady one, however still exposes the emotional bondage between main characters. Julie Delpy gives the best performance compared with two previous. She's great. As if she exactly knows how should Celine look like (well, maybe because she wrote it). Each speech of her is full of pure emotions and sincerity, as though she has lived all those years of Celine, with Jesse. I can make sure that Julie is one of the top contenders in Oscar best actress race. Ethan Hawke's is an fantastic example of good dramatic acting. A man loving a woman of his dreams tries to be a good father to three different children. He really loves the lady he met many many years ago, but also feels obligation towards those who were hurt because of that. I can't make sure predictions about his award year, but he is not bad candidate for trophies at all. If you have a question why I did not rate this movie with 10 stars, I can tell that it is a fair one. But let me tell this: sometimes I get lost in endless discussions and dialogues. Time by time I started getting bored. For example, a car scene just made me want skipping it. An there are few moments like this. Without them, Before Midnight would be perfection and top movie so far.",Before Midnight

The screenplay's evolution is nothing short of remarkable, the way you get drawn into all the little details and idiosyncrasies of the character's worlds throughout the 3 movies make for almost a surreal and unimaginable experience while watching movies. The dialogue between Jesse and Celine was so intellectually rich and thought provoking it has me existentially introspecting on my own life and journey. The connection was just so well nuanced and real life like my eyes were plastered to the screen like I was watching the most captivating thriller ever made.

His use of space and extended takes really make what could have been stagy and plodding into something lively and cinematic. This reminded me of a less opaque CERTIFIED COPY. Fine company, indeed. There are few characters more fully fleshed out and rigorously believable than Jesse and Celine and the naturalism with which the actors write and play these characters has never been more apparent or appreciated.

Whenever it was that I first watched the first one, a somewhat untypical romantic comedy starring the 1990's old Julie Delpy, a frenchwoman on her way back from her grandmother, and Ethan Hawke, an american man flying home from vienna after some time backpacking in europe. They talk for a minute before reaching the trainstation, and upon getting out, he crabs his courrage to ask the silly question : do you want to go out with me? Litteraly. Out of the train, meaning. Well, that's the first one. A lengh-long dialog between the two smart 20- something in linklater's screenplaying style, and the second act, shows the man as a writer whom found some success based on a novel he wrote about their encounter. But twenty years later, it seems like none of the rom-com clichés are left to exploit. The two worned out forty something still have some wit if only to satirize over the bad shape of their relationship, after ten years of daily lives and twins, which only makes it more realistic.

118,axapvov,Circle Of Love,6,4 March 2015,"Conversation movies need substance more than anything. If you're going to listen to people talk for about two hours, they should have something interesting to say. Richard Linklater knows that. His subjects are relevant and there is always a valid point behind his film's reflections. His insight comes from an honest, caring interest about life and love, and he delivers it in a subtle, truthful and intelligent way. Before Midnight, being his most flawed conversation film, is still not an exception in that aspect. It deals with something as relevant as the downfall of love, in a way that defies years and years of Hollywood propaganda about soulmates, half oranges and unrealistic partner expectations. I thank him for that. Evasion movies can be entertaining, but they never tell what happens years after the couple walks into the sunset, Linklater does. Relationships too often fall into poisonous dynamics which seem more unavoidable the more nonsense and bs they are; resentment can accumulate for years; selfishness is always on the menu and the way you perceive your significant other can blur so much that you'll wonder who the hell is that person and why are you together in the first place.My humble interpretation is that ¨true¨ in ¨true love¨ means real, as in The Matrix. It's happening, it's true, along with the poisonous habits come reconciliation routines, familiarity and care. You can either stay in that relentless circle of love or you can try on your own, and maybe find yet another circle.In Before Midnight, Linklater best accomplishment is to inspire all of that reasoning with a film riddled with flaws, that feels as tired of itself as the couple, as if it was a due paper work you must fill in order to go on with your life, something unpleasant that has to be done rather than delaying it any more. Characters lack layers, their personality malfunctions are hideously exaggerated and their reactions are way too much forced, again, as if the movie itself wanted to get it over with.As in love, it's your choice what part of the circle you want to stay with.",Before Midnight

I'll tell what are some good things about it.It's very real. No relationship is perpetually hunky-dory, there are issues and there are conflicts which needs to be dealt. Midnight depicts them very subtly. Also, there's not always a closure of things in real life, there are some loose ends or just some dots, similarly you see midnight ending on some dots and not a period or a conclusion, maybe many viewers didn't like that but that's how it is.However, the movie itself is not a great watch unlike it's two predecessors, lacks in dialogues compared to the two.

121,SteveMierzejewski,The Best Before,9,14 July 2013,"This is the best film of the ""Before"" series. I would give these films a rating of 7, 8, and 9, respectively. Before Midnight is, by far, the most serious of the series and asks some fundamental questions about love, romance, and long-term relationships. For me, the main question asked by everyone in this film was: Does romance endure or is it killed by time and the routine of daily life? Women, as delineated by Julie Delpy's character, Celine, are trapped by their mothering instinct to care for those around them. They both love and resent their children at the same time and feel trapped in their roles as unappreciated caregivers. Men, according to her, are dominated by their desire to procreate. Women worry that they will lose those physical attributes that led their partners to pursue them in the first place. Celine continually questions enduring love in the face of this deterioration. Of course, if she is right, if romance was initially only based on physical attraction, then, women do face a grim future. Men are seen as biological robots, unable to stem their drive to procreate with younger, more attractive females. Indeed, at the beginning of the film, the future of love and sex is discussed and is predicted to culminate in some sort of simulated reality without the need for biological sexual partners at all. In this case, what is the purpose of love and romance? Do they only exist as some biological scam? Is their purpose only to induce a sort of biological temporary insanity that leads us to procreate and continue future generations and the species in general? The answer must be, yes, unless there is some other, for argument's sake, spiritual component to romance that lets those infected with it see beyond aging with all its physical decay. This seems to be the foundation of the debate between the two characters and whether the ending of this film solves this debate, I leave to you.Those familiar with the before films will understand its almost improvisational style, however, it is mainly the acting ability of the two main characters that give it this dimension. In truth, it is a clearly thought out exploration of love in the face of reality, a reality that becomes increasingly challenging with time together and the necessity of caring for children. This is not a film for those looking for a rom-com but for those who are more interested in the deeper meaning of relationships. It is certainly a film that will give you many ideas to ponder and, perhaps, make you reconsider your current role in your relationships.",Before Midnight

Throughout the movie she thinks that she has done a great service in raising the kids and making dinner as some big deal which was not? But in reality; if we look around we find out that in any culture or country women are there to raise the children and the men to work to get money to feed and take care of them which the writer in the movie wants to negate, and in the same attempt he failed miserably. I think that with or without education you cannot beat the nature, the laws of the nature or this world would remain the same for every man and woman who live on this planet. Putting one x-rated scene of the wife in the movie doesn't change anything and the fact remains man and wife are two wheels of life cycle and their duties are earmarked long before we were born and it will remain as such till it ends! I gave this movie 5 out of 10.",Before Midnight
123,TheMovieSnob247,Reality takes centre stage in the conclusion of a great romance trilogy,7,21 October 2013,"We fast forward in the love story of Jesse and Celine. Jesse now lives in Europe and they've had two children together. They're almost at the end of a summer vacation in Greece as Jesse drops off his son (from his previous marriage) to the airport. As they drive back to their vacation cottage, Jesse begins to lament the fact he's missing important moments in his son's life. As they discuss options for addressing this, tensions run high and their relationship is tested in new and unexpected ways.One word constantly came to mind as I watched the final instalment of this trilogy: reality. Some have said that Before Sunrise was unrealistically romantic and hopelessly idealistic. They've also said (and I agreed) that Before Sunset was the better of the two because it offered a sizable dose of reality along with the hope of a more mature romance due to the life experience of the characters. If Before Sunset was a sizable dose on reality, then Before Midnight can be described as a full on punch in the face of it. Much of the naiveté of the first two films and characters is absent; in hindsight, this is to be expected. This film is strictly about the nature of a relationship as it's matured and it caught me off guard. I definitely viewed it differently; in a way that it almost seems out of place compared to the other films. Because the first two were so idealistic, this one completely shattered that notion and presented a raw, unfiltered view of being together with someone for such a long time and the inevitable challenges this presents. So much so I was shocked at a number of points as it unfolded and at times, uncomfortable. It seems Richard Linklater intentionally wanted to smash the romance bubble he created earlier in the series (much to my surprise). I've found it really nail down my first impression of this film, because I've seen the others so many times and this one is so different and not quite what I expected; I've always found expectations for a film are crucial in how I judge it. While others have praised this turn in the series, I found the drama slightly over the top. I realize now (after reading other reviews) that this trilogy is very much a personal experience for the viewer; their interpretation of it relies heavily on their own life experience and the position they're currently in a relationship. Maybe I'm just not in the stage of life I need to be in to appreciate this film (I guess I'm somewhere in the Before Sunset stage) or maybe I'm just too idealistic on love. Either way, after my first viewing, I can say I definitely enjoyed the other films more.Now having said that, this is a very good film. The dialogue between Delpy and Hawke remains stellar and their chemistry is undeniable; especially in the scenes where they fight as I found those very convincing. These scenes are clearly some of their best work in the series. The essence of the location in which the film unfolds is captured very well (as was Vienna and Paris in the other films). I especially enjoyed the dialogue and camera work as they walked through the old ruins. The film also presents many thought provoking ideas of how love and attraction change over time through the addition of some new, interesting supporting characters. I really enjoyed that aspect of the film.I found the ending somewhat unsatisfying, but have a strong feeling this is is a film I'll appreciate over time. While not my favourite of the trilogy at this point, this is a must see for fans of the original films and one of the better films I've seen this year. www.themoviesnob.ca@the_movie_snob",Before Midnight
124,seronjaa-797-313124,When the legendary Before series becomes just another breakup movie,6,15 February 2017,"So, this movies is supposed to show us how people in ""mature"" relationships behave. Maybe it's appealing for people, who as these two didn't find true love in their lives and by watching this movie, they can say- hey, our relationship isn't THAT bad. Or some people may like, that this movie sort of proves a point about long lasting love not being possible in this world. Boo-hoo. This movie would be believable if we didn't got to know the characters in the previous movies. Those two seemed perfect for each other- they could talk about little things and just enjoy life. Or so it seemed. I can't imagine such chatty and open people to not be able to talk about their feelings, fears and insecurities for 9 years of their relationship. And the fight seemed, like it was the first one after 9 years together! I'm really sorry for the person, whose life this movie describes. I would rather just listen to their friends life stories at the dinner table for the whole movie, than this. And the ending? If it's supposed to show us, how people can overcome even the worst fights, because of love, then it has totally missed the point. If it shows us how we can expect a breakup after the movie, than what't she point? I think it's painful to see people praising such a movie for being so realistic. It just shows the state of mind of so many people, that is sadness, hopelessness and egoism.",Before Midnight
125,laursene,Overpoweringly annoying people,3,29 July 2014,"I liked the first two films in the series, but now I'm questioning my judgment. Just saw Before Midnight, the third, which pummels us with how beautiful, wonderful, sensitive, wise, soulful, charming, earthy, tasteful, piercingly perceptive, honest, brilliant, talented, witty, caring, committed, and utterly, ineffably perfect its protagonists are. Of course they are! Everyone says so, including not only the ""distinguished"" British author, the gorgeous young lovers, and the attractive Greek couple they spend their vacation with, but the woman at the airport who asks for both of their signatures on Jesse's book, ""because it would mean so much to my husband."" All on a postcard-perfect Greek island, no less.My apologies to both Erich Rohmer and the recent Woody Allen for ever having complained about how cute and perfect their characters can be. Linklater trumps them easily, to the point I was hoping it was all supposed to be a goof on terminal bourgeois whiteness (one longs to put the script in the hands of a reincarnated Luis Bunuel to see what he'd do with it). There's some kind of serious theme rolling around here in the long conversations, the suggestions of how our younger selves speak to our older selves, etc., no doubt further explored in Boyhood. But the sexual politics are about as profound as Men Are from Mars Women Are From Venus, and there's nothing much to care about in Jesse and Celine's big fight, because by that point in the film, we don't like either of them enough to care.Before Midnight represents a colossal lapse of self-awareness by Linklater, and an even more embarrassing load of self-absorption from its stars and co-authors.",Before Midnight
126,thegodfathersaga,something beautiful..,10,16 December 2013,"given the creative people involved and my past experience with their work, the thought of Before Midnight turning out to be dull and unimaginative has never crossed my mind, especially after the reception it received. the thing with sequels is that a good chunk of them are basically remakes of the original films, driven mostly by popular and commercial demands. in and of themselves, sequels aren't inherently bad, there really just has to be a genuine creative interest and desire to tell another chapter of a story. such is exactly the kind of continuation we have here; a continuation that even enhances its predecessor by making it a part of a larger story.when we meet Jesse and Celine this time around, they are a couple. and as we've come to expect, the experiences of two protagonists take place over a short period of time, the director shows us a day of their holiday in Greece. things seems idyllic on the surface, but as is the nature of relationships, tensions are ever present. it's like a river, it rolls on continuously carrying much of what's good, but presented with certain circumstances, it can dry up to harmful results. or maybe i'm just way off and Sprinsteen's song, The River, has nothing to do with this.The couple wanders through the Greek city on their way to a hotel, talking, being humorous, getting to know each other more and also quarreling. In all three of the films, the conversations between Celine and Jesse is the mainstay and it's what makes the films so appealing and brilliant. It's not so much about what they say as it is the rhythm and their interplay back and forth. It's such a delight to watch. it is a pleasure to see that even if they have aged, they haven't lost their sweet folly and their wry humor, having fun again discussing anything, from regrets to wishes, to the meaning of life.i love it. i fall for moments like in the end, when they're sitting in a small café table and Jesse begins to improvise a story about how he has come from the future..",Before Midnight
127,advaitkamat,How do you romanticize a romance?,8,10 October 2013,"It's the rarest of things, this. I'm desolate that the ""Before"" trilogy has come to an end but what an end it is. Richard Linklater's ""Before Midnight"" is the best installment of the three, a darker, funnier follow-up to the first two and a lot more intuitive too. For eighteen years, we've been following the lives of Jesse and Celine, who had first met on a train in '94 when they were young, and we now see them in their early 40s, conflicted and befuddled about what they want from their lives. And from the three movies, we got three perspectives - of twenty year-olds, thirty year-olds and forty year-olds. The conversations never stop delighting, the antics are charmingly jejune and the insights are consummate. We've got to hand it to Linklater for romanticizing a romance, a modern one and an old-fashioned one, with equal zeal in his three movies. The trilogy, which I consider to be one of the greatest of all-time, is a fine example of idealistic cinema. ""Before Midnight"" hasn't got a plot, much like the first two, but it's more personal, more arcane this time. It starts off with Jesse (Ethan Hawke) dropping his son off to the airport, a son from a failed marriage and then heading out to Greece with Celine (Julie Delpy), with whom he has twin daughters, we learn. As the two of them meet the people who invited them to Greece, and then take a walk around Greece to the hotel that's been booked for them, they cogitate on the times they've spent together. ""Before Midnight"" is much more crowded, since it's got more speaking parts, but somehow that idea sticks. We've seen Jesse and Celine, rarely anyone else in the first two, so I believe this one's more evolved. The characters that are new aren't any less fascinating. The discussion during lunch is candid and often funny and it turns bittersweet in the end. Hawke and Delpy also seem to be much more comfortable with their characters, as if they've been living in them for too long, and the conversations now lean towards marriage life and its aggravations. You've got to admit, this one is more romantic than ""Before Sunset"", its predecessor, and the chemistry between the two crackles. The streets of Peloponnese are captured wonderfully by cinematographer Christos Voudouris, who exudes a calm control over the camera and gifts us a lot of eye-candy. And, as always, the writing is remarkable. Linklater, teaming up with Hawke and Delpy, weaves an intricate although searingly honest view on modern romance. The writing in the scene where Jesse and Celine bicker over what they've done for their relationship is startling in its candor. I enjoyed that chinwag so much that I watched it over and over again and still wanted to watch it again. What a wondrous piece of writing! Hawke and Delpy are, once again, spectacular in their roles. They have a certain easiness with each other now, something that wasn't so overt before and they do fine jobs in both departments.I expect ""Before Midnight"" to get an Oscar nod this time around and fill the void that's been there for eighteen years now. If it gets rebuffed again, I'd have to say that that would be an expensive, preposterous snub and an appalling one, too. It's one of the best films of the year so far.",Before Midnight
128,emvan,"Not the Most Lovable of the Trilogy, But, Yes, the Best Yet",10,10 June 2013,"The giddy romantic tension that pervades every moment of Before Sunset -- the literally pivotal film of this brilliant ongoing series -- is never going to be topped. But that doesn't mean that Linklater, Delpy, and Hawke cannot produce a deeper, richer, film, one that offers an entirely different set of rewards. And they have done exactly that.I would strongly urge fans of these movies to re-watch the first two installments, and then see this. They really do inform one another in rather remarkable ways.TECHNICALLY A SPOILER, BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT IT'S COMING AFTER THE FIRST FEW MINUTES Probably the most important thing that couples do is *fight*, and this movie includes the best, truest, and most honestly portrayed couples fight you will ever see. Each character alternates between insight and obliviousness, between playing fair and striking low blows, between adroitly defusing the tension and needlessly escalating it, and there's no good guy and no bad guy, just two achingly human, real people that we have grown to know so well and root so strongly for.SPOILER FOR WHETHER ANOTHER INSTALLMENT IS PROMISEDUnlike the first two, the movie ends with major unresolved issues between Jesse and Celine (the issues underlying the fight). It's thrilling to consider that the filmmakers will soon be plotting out the next nine years of their lives, including the resolution of those issues, and planning how the next screenplay will reveal what happened in casual dialogue, as they face the next key point in their relationship. 2022 cannot come too soon!",Before Midnight
129,TimMeade,Quality to be Encouraged,8,5 August 2013,"This is the final part of Richard Linklater's relationship trilogy which began with Before Sunrise in 1995, followed by Before Sunset nine years later.Nearly two decades from when they first met, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) are now a couple living in Europe with twin daughters conceived almost immediately from when they first re-met 9 years ago – Jesse also has a son from his long-extinct marriage who resides with his mother in Chicago. Whilst both successful in their careers, Celine is somewhat in the shadow of Jesse, a successful novelist.At its very core, the film is essentially a dialogue between the couple as they explore their relationship and where their future lies – both physically and spiritually.A film of only a few extended acts, it is at its most powerful and engaging when Delpy and Hawke are by themselves with no distractions. One scene of around 20 minutes duration is a single take, a static camera merely the recorder of a conversation between the two as they drive back from the airport having dropped off Jesse's son after a summer vacation.Relatively speaking, the film is less successful when it broadens out and introduces peripheral characters. The scene as they enjoy an al fresco lunch at the writers' retreat where they have been staying for the summer seemed to consist of the other participants merely taking it in turn to give a speech, although it was masquerading as a conversation. That the speeches sometimes bordered on the pompous was, however, quite deliberate on Linklater's part, I'm sure. And the criticism needs to be put in context – even when not at its best, it is still far superior to most other fare.In total, the film does little more than follow a successful and well-heeled couple as they talk and discuss, sometimes heatedly, their relationship. It centres on first-world problems – 'Do we live in Paris? Do we live in Chicago? Do you believe your successful career to be more important than my successful career?' Were the film made by lesser talents, it might possibly be insufferably maudlin, bordering on self-pity. That it successfully steers well clear from this and presents a completely believable couple, is a testimony to its superior writing, direction and terrific acting from both Delpy and Hawke, both of whom are totally flawless. It draws you to believe that despite their apparent enviable lifestyle, the quest for domestic bliss is classless and every bit as difficult to attain no matter how wealthy you may be.The film is minimalist – the scenes are long, camera angles rarely vary and the only incidental music is the very occasional tinkling of a completely unobtrusive piano. Everything is geared to have focus on the extensive but never overwhelming dialogue. The linking shots, in fact all the cinematography set outside, capture extremely well Greece's wonderful light.It is doubtless preferable to have seen the earlier two films in this series, but anyone coming new to it should have no problem picking up the story and concept. And they will also, I am sure, then wish to look out the first two segments.All involved in this project, deserve plaudits for embarking on such a long-term venture and seeing it through with such class – and it oozes class. Richard Linklater, again with Ethan Hawke, currently nears the end of a 12 year project, Boyhood, following the story of a boy growing up with divorced parents. The self-taught Mr Linklater is clearly a film-maker who thinks ahead.",Before Midnight
130,giantpanther,A Truly Bad Movie and I was a huge Before Sunrise fan,1,20 June 2013,"I can consider myself a fan of the before series of films, I saw Before Sunrise years before the sequel came out and hipsters started jumping on the band wagon of this film. To explain why before midnight fails I need to explain the film from the perspective of both Before Sunrise and Before Sunset.Now Before Sunrise was a slightly flawed yet still really captivating and original film about two people who randomly by chance meet in Europe, Jesse the American and Celine the french girl. They walk around together for a day until dawn and then Jesse must catch his plane back to America and thats it the end, they agree to meet up again a year later but as we find out in Before Sunset that falls apart.Now Before Sunrise is cute because they are both supposed to be 23 in the film and its OK for 23 year olds to have stupid ideas or be overly dramatic because hey they are young and thats how it works. In Before Sunrise the cracks started to show, the film still held up but the plot began to meander into strange directions, first off when they meet up again they still decide to be ""cutesy"" around each other which is a little odd for people in their thirties to be that way. But the cuteness of the situation is allowed as they haven't seen each other in a long time, also the weakness of Before Sunset exists because get this Jesse writes an acclaimed book to get Celine back and the book is about how they both met.The concept of Jesse as an author is weak because it is very apparent that the guy is kind of stupid and a goof, there is never any indication of depth or being an articulate human being. The other thing is in Before Sunset you get the feeling these two should not be together, they are different and Celine gets annoyed by Jesse but that of course is all very slight. The ""celine getting annoyed by Jesse"" plot line takes the front and center part of the stage in Before Midnight.Really this should have just been two movies, I truly believe that. In part one they separate at the end and in part two they get back together and stay together and just leave it at that. Before Midnight first off doesn't function quite well because of this fact, Jesse and Celine still have stupid cheap back and forth banter between each other except that doesn't make sense because now they aren't 23 and they definitely haven't gone a long time without seeing each other so they are 40 somethings who argue about nothingness.During the first segment of the movie, Jesse and Celine driving back from the airport with their daughters in the back, Celine gives Jesse a hard time about eating one of their daughters apples but in a way a 14 year old would taunt another 14 year old not the way a couple in a long term relationship would act. There are many examples of that and thus begins a two hour long film filled with Celine's passive aggressive and aggressive aggressive attitude towards Jesse.You get the feeling Celine truly and genuinely hates every aspect of her life, she is with a guy that she thinks is dumb, she has two kids when she never wanted any kids, her environmental job always results in failures and having to work with idiots shes annoyed by every aspect of her existence and its truly miserable to have to watch her. There's nothing entertaining or charming about Celine, she is simply very very bitter at Jesse for ""ruining"" her life by getting involved with her.Now the argument here is ""well this is reality"" OK watching paint dry is also an element of reality it doesn't mean I want to go to a movie theater and experience it. This film is different there's none of that whimsical carefree attitude that exists in the first two movies. The few brief moments of entertainment come from Celine not being around, Jesse has some conversations early on with some author who invited him out to Greece to stay with him.Also when Jesse and Celine arrive at the hotel the owner of the hotel asks Jesse to sign a copy of the books he has written then begs Celine to sign them which she refuses because being angry and bitter is all she knows how to be in this film. Finally Jesse pressures her into signing them, but shes angry as always. Also twice Celine is on the phone with Jesse's son and then hangs up before he has a chance to chat with him, which is actually pretty rude.This was such a garbage movie, an utter waste of time and talent, although probably not that much of a waste of time for those who made it I am sure they shot it and scripted it in about 5 days. The critics have all praised this movie but they only praise things that are different, and sitting and listening to two people argue incessantly on screen for 2 hours is certainly different but also stupid.",Before Midnight
131,zevt,Too depressingly realistic to be enjoyable,5,26 September 2013,"(I'll warn when I get to the spoilers)This is the third in a trilogy which includes Before Sunrise and Before Sunset. I can't imagine this one being watched as a stand-alone movie and having anything near the effect it should. In fact, I would even recommend watching these several years apart. I watched these movies as they were released, and being the same age as this fictional but very realistic couple made it more of an involving experience.The strongest aspects of this trilogy are the flowing endless dialogue, the acting, and the real characters. As opposed to many other opinions though, I sometimes felt that the dialogue in the last two movies became too pretentious and condensed to be real. These movies need more silence, pauses and looks.In Before Sunrise, they were in their early 20s, smart and practical but open to experience an idealistic short romance based on their chance encounter. They connected, they were charming, they were real, and they pulled it off much to the delight of audiences.In Before Sunset and nine years later, for the first half of the movie, they were unbearably self-obsessed and pretentious and talked at each other instead of with each other. They spent a few hours together, and gradually their attraction and chemistry came back, and made you believe that they may actually recover from their last few years of miserable relationships and closed-minded lifeless lives that were obviously bringing them down, as long as they got together and developed what they had. Some charm and romance crept in despite their newfound self-deprecating cynicism, leaving audiences with an open-ended ending full of potential. I hated it at first, then grew to like it better on second viewing.In Before Midnight, in a too-realistic portrayal, they have been a couple for 9 years (with kids), but their personality differences have not been worked on and their marriage is on the rocks.Jesse is a successful writer but his break with his previous wife and son in order to be with Celine is causing increasing strains in his current marriage. Little annoying things he does add to the strain, but what is very obvious in this movie is that she doesn't love him anymore so every little thing adds to the complaints.Celine in this movie is like an amalgam of every neurosis in modern women. She is an angry activist, an angry feminist, an unfulfilled angry wife, a woman who is so lost and confused regarding what she wants, she cannot be satisfied no matter how many efforts he makes to clarify things and express his love for her, and she doesn't have the tools and outlook to fix her feelings for him so this is a Sisyphean task in any case. As three-dimensional as she is, this is not a sympathetic character to say the least.*spoilers* Which is why, at the end of the movie, anyone with a brain will realize that the small bone she throws him at the end is worthless and that this marriage is doomed. Which is why, as realistic as this movie is, it simply was not enjoyable. Not that movies need to be fun or romantic, but I do expect them to be rewarding or insightful in one way or another. I do not need to go to the movies to watch neurotic people flail at their last threads of marriage and fail at it miserably because of commonplace emotional incompetence.If there is a next movie in a few years, the only possible outcome is that they got divorced soon after this night, and they get together one more time to talk about how they failed their marriage with humorous hindsight and resignation. And then they have sex for old time's sake because the attraction will still be there, although they have no clue what to do with it. That's my screenplay for the next one.But Ingmar Bergman already covered similar ground with his superb and recommended 'Scenes from a Marriage'.If it were up to me, I would have made this movie differently: The fight wouldn't have been so convincingly final. And they would recover from a vicious fight because they made us believe that they built a solid loving base with which to recover. That could have been just as deep, realistic and much more enjoyable.",Before Midnight
132,soncoman,"Two Hours of Talk, Talk, Talk... and Absolutely Enthralling...",8,15 May 2013,"The 56th San Francisco International came to a close at the magnificent Castro Theatre with a showing of Richard Linklater's ""Before Midnight"", the third in Linklater's series of ""Before"" films. Preceded by ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"", the film continues the story of Jesse and Celine, now a middle-aged, two child couple on vacation in Greece. Things are not quite right between the two, and there is much to be said between them. So they talk. For two hours. And it is absolutely enthralling.I have to admit that I haven't seen the first two films. I was aware of them, but they just never jumped out at me as something I had to see. I admire Linklater's work ( I thought last year's ""Bernie"" was one of the best films of the year) but just never had a reason to put seeing those films above others I had more interest in. I attended the screening mainly because it was the closing night film, but had concerns that not having seen the previous two would put me at a disadvantage in appreciating his latest. Festival friend (and ""Before"" series lover) Stacy McCarthy assured me the film stands on its own.She was right. Nothing much goes on in this film but conversations between people, but these conversations are fascinating and have a sense of reality about them often missing from films of this nature. Credit for that obviously goes to director Linklater and actors Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, who collaborated on the script. It doesn't hurt that the film was shot in Greece, but the picturesque beauty of that country comes second to the riveting portrayal of a couple at the stage of life where the often painful questioning of a couple's future begins.Two hours with these characters flew by, and as the credits rolled my first thoughts were about how much I really liked the film, and how I need to think more ""out of the box"" when it comes to selecting films to view. I'm guilty of often limiting my scope, and I'm thankful that Film Festivals force me to widen my film horizons.www.worstshowontheweb.com",Before Midnight
133,taz1004,Look forward to another one in 9 years,8,15 December 2014,"I watched the first one 18 years ago when I was 25. The second one when I was 34. And then the last one at 42. It feels like I'm growing up with this movie. What's strange is that when I watch the first one again, I feel like I'm looking at my own youth. This is a very difficult to describe feeling but I am looking forward to another one in 9 years.It must've been challenging for Ethan Hawke to be on screen and talking for entire duration of the movie for all 3 movies. But he and Julie Delpy does it so well. And in each generation of the movie, I like the fact that the conversation changes to relate that age group. The first movie seems corny when I watch it again now at 42 but it certainly didn't seem that way 18 years ago. I can see Jesse and Celine changing and reflect myself from the couple to see how I've changed over the years. This movie is something you would experience rather than just watch.Only downside I'd say is that you probably would have had to watch all 3 films at its release for proper experience.",Before Midnight
134,Arcturus1980,A test of their love,10,22 June 2013,"There is a moment in Before Sunset where Ethan Hawke's Jesse tells Julie Delpy's Celine that he wrote a fictional version of their story where they rendezvous in Vienna and end up not liking each other. It appealed to her sense of realism. Indeed, she later touched on it again. Walking out of the theater I knew Before Midnight more or less answered that vital question.Here we add nine freaking years to the previous 13 or so hours of their time together. So, understandably, Jesse and Celine are not as we left them. Bearing the increasingly heavy chains of life's complications, they still love to bat around ideas and make each other laugh. More importantly, they really want to understand each other and be understood.For Jesse, seeing little of his son Hank (now 13 and played by Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) is the unacceptable cost of being with Celine, mishandling his separation, and having a vindictive, dejected ex-wife. Desperately wanting to be consistently present in Hank's life, their latest farewell is the final straw. He and Celine had been in regular contact with Hank for two years in New York City, but Celine's very complicated pregnancy with twins (Ella and Nina, now 7-years-old and played by Jennifer and Charlotte Prior respectively) made it imperative that she be close to her mother in Paris.Jesse obviously did the right thing by staying with Celine and he knows it, yet he shoulders the guilt of an absentee father and externalizes it. Celine, though not exactly an innocent bystander, is subjected to unfair manipulation. Generally quite reasonable as to the father/son question, she is, by my reading, unconsciously passive-aggressive about it. The unarguable fact is that a move to Chicago (where Hank presently lives with his mother) would amount to babysitting every other weekend for want of joint custody. As for Hank, he gets on well with Jesse, but there is a definite sense of detachment. He doesn't even look over his shoulder as he turns the corner out of sight at the airport.Jesse is otherwise very good: he is leading the life of a successful writer (three books out and a fourth in the works) with Celine--the unquestionable love of his life--as his wife and a good mother to their twin daughters who are healthy (and of course dressed differently). He just somehow figured on Hank living with them. By thinking through his crisis aloud, Celine (no longer a closed book) says in a half-kidding way that it is the beginning of the end for them.It is nice to see them interacting socially for the first time in the marvelous, detail-rich dinner scene. Everyone contributes more or less evenly as the conversation ranges from artificial intelligence to gender differences to various interesting perspectives on love and romance. The trio of Linklater, Hawke and Delpy pour themselves into making the absolute most of these naturalistic films, and it shines through palpably. It is interesting to learn that Hawke and Delpy wrote a lot of each other's dialogue. This happens to be the funniest of the three films, in my opinion. Great music again, too! Celine, feeling disconnected from Jesse as to her own stresses, wants out of their planned night together, but irrevocable arrangements had been made on their behalf. Walking together as we had come to know them, their natural chemistry is evident in short order. Celine acknowledges this while remarking in a downplayed way that she doesn't feel the connection at times. Jesse responds in jest, unaware of it as a crisis that will soon converge with his own. They enter their hotel room feeling good about the whole shebang. Then Hank calls again and things gradually spiral downward into a serious case of love on the rocks for these well-meaning veritable soulmates in the southern Peloponnese of Greece.Celine is more complicated than Jesse--who is not about to leave her and the girls for Hank in Chicago--and even less inclined to contentment in life. The professionally-minded activist with little in the way of a maternal instinct has been saddled with the aforementioned twins and is essentially trying to balance domestic mundanities with her environmental work in the ineffectual non-profit sector. She no longer finds time for music, her creative outlet. By contrast, Jesse to her mind takes his easygoing novelist life to the highfaluting hilt. Though wonderfully good-natured to be sure, envy continues to be a problem of hers. She respects his intelligence, but slights his work, and being the inspiration for his first two intimate novels does not sit well with her at all. She also feels every day of her 41 years and even accuses him of infidelity, as if only to clear the air.The backfiring of a wind turbine project has her set on working for the government again despite doubts. Not knowing she considers it a ""dream job"" of sorts, Jesse rouses Celine's feminist spirit by suggesting she perhaps forgo the position for something in Chicago. Celine quotes someone in earnest: ""Women explore for eternity in the vast garden of sacrifice."" It took Jesse's out and out mockery of her innermost feminism to later warrant her saying she doesn't think she loves him anymore.In the final scene we find Celine understandably despondent and Jesse appropriately self-reproachful. Employing a time travel fantasy reminiscent of that which convinced her to see Vienna with him 18 years before, he realizes his failure despite desirous efforts to understand her. By reconciling herself to him, Celine sees in his sincerity the very magic she spoke of in Vienna. It could not come full circle more wonderfully.Their protracted relationship continues to be the very height of my cinematic experience, so it pleases me greatly to know that the door is being left wide open for a fourth film and hopefully more. Richard Linklater, Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke will know if it is right.",Before Midnight
135,britishdominion,Still There... but Gone.,9,28 June 2013,"BEFORE MIDNIGHT continues the unerring quality that director Richard Linklater, Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke created from their first incredible films. Those movies were romantic, melancholy and life-affirming. The pair has wonderful chemistry and the two imbue their characters hopes, thoughts and realities like few on-screen pairings have ever done. I enjoyed revisiting the films over a weekend in the nearly 10 years since the last entry in this film series has taken place.This third film continues that - it is expertly directed, written and staged in gorgeous Greece landscapes. And - it maintains the trademark walk-and-talk and talk and talk signature that were the first two films' heralded mise-en-scene.As a viewer, I was impressed with the new film in how the story progressed since we last visited. These are good, interesting and followable-characters. We think we know them. Unfortunately at the same time, the magic and the wistfulness the cast received to make it work comfortable between the two and patience or understanding seems to be in exceedingly short supply.Instead - and kudos to the creative team - this rocked the audience away from expecting a welcome but been-there, done-that sequel pattern.The SPOILER surprise is the couple is actually together now, with twins of their own, and a life their lives are less than perfect.Here is where I disengaged with the film on an entirely personal level. The fights, the yelling and the accusations were very intense and brutal. The acting is so good, that it makes anyone who has lived through this kind of relationship meltdown feel as though they are living through it ALL OVER again. Sitting in my multiplex, I know I did. It made me anxious and sad.BEFORE MIDNIGHT is a completely original and fully-realized film: it's hands-down one of the best movies of 2013. But unlike the two previous installments, I just don't know if I ever want to sit through this one again.It's real, it's actual, and it just skips right over the years of good and anchors itself in what is bad in a relationship.Bring on the 4th movie, folks!",Before Midnight
136,biba_yu,Difficult to watch,4,3 August 2020,"Don't get me wrong, movie looks beautiful, scenes are amazing and directing is good, acting is also great...therefor 4 starts from me. But after watching sweet and romantic two movies, with two likable, smart and good looking leads, this one is like kick in the guts. While scenes of Greek lands and traveling, as well as everything visually was stunning, Jesse, and especially Celine were not that fun to listen. I loved Celine's character in two first movies so it was a nasty surprise to see her as bitter, angry and resentful woman who seems to hate everything in her life, and instead of doing something to improve it, is just throwing insults at her husband continually. There was not a single kind word, single smile or charming gesture, not even a tiny sparkle in the eye, from her the entire movie, nothing that would made us believe why would Jesse care so much for her. She is all rage, negativity, despise and endless row of picking fights. If Jesse was so bad as we are supposed to believe, then give us something, anything to make us see that! We weren't given single reason for why she would hate him so much. From that lovely girl we saw in first movies, she got so annoying, nasty and negative person, and we were simply not given enough reason to understand why? If she hates him, why doesn't she just leave? If he cares so much, why does he care? She hates his gut, everyone can see that. There wasn't a single kind word she said to him whole movie. She throws him a tiny bone at the end, but even that felt weak and temporary. she is also selfish about his needs to be with his son, she doesn't know what she wants, and she is literally trying to make him feel like crap constantly. From the beginning of the movie when she picks a fight over stupid things like Jesse eating a stupid apple their kid left, which was ridiculous, throughout the whole movie where she humiliated him in front of their friends, and then proceeded to yell, foam, and moan about her life while I still couldn't understand after the whole freaking movie WHY is she so miserable. What was she expecting in marriage and in life? And why blame it all on Jesse? Did he force her in marriage and having kids and having lousy job or whatever? I still don't get it. Most of the time, I just wanted to say ""Oh shut up already!"". JEsse most of the movie acts confused, and out of touch, like he doesn't get it why is she so angry. She is your wife, dude, you lived together for like 8 or so years. Do you even know her? He fights for her attention and tries to ignore all the hate, or honestly is unaware of it which was sad, and looks like he doesn't even understand she hates him. That is, my people, what you are going to watch in this movie, angry woman picking fights and throwing insults and confused husband who is trying for seemingly days of this torture, to calm her down. What did you do to Celine? And no,it's not ""normal life"" if we don't have any real context, in absence of any explanation or context, Celine comes up just as highly unlikable character no one wants to listen, and Jesse seems like a total pushover.

138,Cat-Wings,"""Before Midnight"" is truly a masterpiece along with ""Before Sunset"" and ""Before Sunrise."" It describes so well between reality and romance",10,10 June 2013,"""Before Midnight"" is the third in a series of spectacular romance films, directed by Richard Linklater. The first film was released in 1995, and the second one came out nine years after the first one. A further nine years later, this long-awaited film was rolled out this May.The story is about an American student, Jesse (Ethan Hawke), who has fallen in love with a French student, Celine (Julie Delpy), on the train to Vienna. The two walk around the town of Vienna until the next morning. Nine years later, Jesse reunites with Celine when he visits a bookshop to promote a book he wrote about their first meeting. They enjoyed a few fleeting hours before his departure.Both ""Before Sunset"" and ""Before Sunrise"" didn't clearly describe how they ended up, which didn't give audiences any expectation of what would happen in the next film. I thought it ended with the previous one, so since I've noticed that they decided to take another sequel, I was looking forward to seeing ""Before Midnight,"" and it filled my imagination.The ""Before"" series is characterized by a long single shots, long conversation, and only the conversation of the two people through most of the stories. Thus, it feels like you are there sitting at a table next to them, listening to their conversation. This film is not exception; a long one shot filled with wit. A romantic love story eighteen years ago. At the reunion nine years ago, Jesse married in the U.S. and has a kid, but their married life wasn't so good. On the other hand Celine was still single. They had to face the reality of their situations. And this time, they are no longer just a romantic - They are both in forties, a relationship cross over America and France, and a reality that Jesse is a married man with a wife and child. They spend the last day of their visiting in Greece where they are invited by fans of his book. I thought it was going to be just painful heartfelt from the reality, however, the ending was better than I expected.They're in their forties. They've become older. It has been eighteen years since their first meeting. Then trying to face the reality of their situation is depicted. Celine has their twin daughters and her body has aged. Jesse is frustrated not to be able to be with his son as a father, negotiation with his ex-wife, and remarriage. It also describes their romantic relationship that they are trying to skim their purity from their reality. I felt like supporting them until in the previous two films because their relationship was depicted from their romantic view. But I don't feel like only agreeing with them this time, since it's more complicated and third party is involved. It makes me realize that it is also the reality.Julie Delpy's acting is conveyed a sensation of tension so well that vents Celine's frustration, while their charming conversation still exist. Among other things, the ending releases all the tension and gives you comfort.""Before Midnight"" is truly a masterpiece along with ""Before Sunset"" and ""Before Sunrise."" Personally, I felt like this version has an end and no sequel would occur. Besides, the ""Before"" series would already be lack of titles, so I don't expect the next one. However, I would have no choice but wait patiently if we can see them nine years later on screen.I watched this film at Alamo Drafthouse in Austin. It was a nice cinema, and I'm happy to watch it in the same city in connection with Richard Linklater and Ethan Hawke.",Before Midnight
139,kastellos,Weakest of the trilogy,4,19 April 2014,"The biggest problem with this film, relative to the first two of the trilogy, is the direction and to a lesser extent, the screenplay. Modern directors are infatuated with the hand held camera, long still shots, extreme close-ups and voyeurism. I'm a senior citizen, so I really dislike these four inevitable techniques in modern non-action films. Let's discuss:1. the hand-held camera: People generally observe the world while seated or standing. When we move, our eye and brain damp out the jiggle. The hand-held camera, which is claimed to be more realistic, in fact, is NOT. Some directors use it so much that one can get sea-sick from watching their movies.2. long still shots: By ""long"" I mean in time. This, I suppose, is to make the film more artsy. Hardly, it just makes it more boring. I have no problem with slow films, Cairo Time a recent film I loved comes to mind, but keeping the camera held on a shot with no movement or dialogue, is simply annoying.3. extreme close-ups: I'm sorry, but I find no interest in the pores on an actor's nose. What do these extreme close-ups add? In the theater, they add a headache or literally a pain in the neck as you have to move your head up and down to take it all in.4. voyeurism: Do I really have to see an actor sucking on a woman's nipple? What does this add? Do I really have to see a 45 year-old woman sitting topless for 5 minutes. All this voyeurism adds nothing to the story. There is also audio voyeurism. I know I'm old, but I have never been to a dinner gathering, except in a college fraternity, where penises were constantly discussed.These techniques are used, I assume, to make the film ""art."" If I want art, I go to the museum. In film, I want a story that makes me laugh or cry or think, or get upset, etc., i.e. hits me emotionally.In addition to these annoyances, unlike the first two, the main characters are not sympathetic. This is not necessarily bad, but in this film they are irrationally unsympathetic. Jessie's sudden obsession with his fatherhood (""I need to be in my son's life full time..."") is not believable. If this were so, he would not have left the US and be with Celine in Paris. Furthermore, Celine's over reaction is demeaning to women. It portrays the stereotype of the illogical, irrational and hysterical woman. And how does the argument end: OK, let's settle nothing, but go have great sex. This may work for 18 year-olds, but not for 45 year-olds. This movie is grossly overrated. See the first two. The only reason to see this one is to see Greece.",Before Midnight
140,EephusPitch,Probably not a date movie,8,19 July 2013,"We catch up with Celine and Jesse as they are summering in the Mani at the villa of Patrick, a distinguished British ex-pat author, who has invited Jesse, now a modestly successful author tentatively working on his fourth book. With some reluctance, Celine agrees to the vacation, leaving her non-profit job in Paris, and bringing along Celine and Jesse's twin girls. Also reluctantly agreeing to the vacation is Hank, Jesse's son from a disastrous early marriage; when dropped off at the airport to return to his mother in Chicago, Hank confesses that he has had the best summer of his life. The setting is idyllic: great scenery, great food, and interesting people. Jesse and Celine are treated to a night away from the twins, in a rather anti-septic hotel; allowed space away from work, parenting, and social obligations, they explore their relationship, and open all the wounds that have scabbed over in the course of the past decade. Both sides of the film, the sunny side and the dark night side, make for riveting viewing. It might help to have seen the previous two films in the series (although, to be honest, I always confuse them with the ""2 Days in..."" films), but you can probably extrapolate them from what you see on the screen.",Before Midnight
141,spkelsekladden,Not really working for me.,2,9 September 2013,"One of the things that made the two previous movies work was the spontaneity, and the constant change of scenery.

And all they do is fight, in different scenery It starts out with them fighting in the car on the way back from the airport, than they take a short break at a dinner party, and a small stroll trough the city, than they are on it again in a hotel room. That's about the entire movie. If you ask me, it really shouldn't have been made. I don't believe in happy ever after etc. But this movie was no point in making, it's kind of like watching your parents divorce settlement from a birds eye perspective I don't get why they choose to film in Greece,there is so much nice scenery in and around Greece,but they use nothing of it.

They were all pretty good if you like the actors, heavy dialog, don't mind suspending some disbelief, and in the 3rd installment a little heartache with a dose of reality.I thought Delpy's character went a little over the top beating up on her man,and children's father verbally. Not that Hawke's character wasn't equally critical in some ways to her, but not as much in my opinion. I would think he'd have a hard time getting over some of the things she said.The movie was beautifully shot and rendered without excessive cuts or meaningless scenes. It was definitely a film that you'd have to pay attention during, and expect some angst throughout. If you're not looking for that, I would pass or wait for some time to kill on a rainy Sunday when you're in the self discovery mode.Oh, this movie is for adults that can somewhat identify with relatively difficult marriage issues spoken out (mild).

There is an absolutely interminable section which is merely a conversation taking place between two adults in the front of a car, while two young girls sleep in the back. It goes on and on and on and on ... much like this review. It's impossible for me to imagine who this movie is for. I got it for my wife because she understands emotions and people and so on whereas I mainly understand science and engineering and rockets and stuff. But my wife had a hard time with it as well. I can definitively say, if you're a man, this movie is not for you, unless you also want to waste a piece of your life. For masochists only.",Before Midnight
146,jessicacoco2005,Annoying Film about a Bickering Couple!,1,5 October 2017,"Because of the great reviews, I expected a profound film that delved into the emotional life of two, long-married people struggling with children, work, and life. What a mistake! Very superficial story line, where we are tortured into seeing two people bickering through the whole film without feeling connected to why they are so bitter and arguing; except that they are.How many writers do most of us know or people who have the time, money, and luxury to travel back and forth to Europe? I don't know about you, but I can't recall the last time I could afford a vacation or even a motel room for that matter. Conversations in the film are so contrived like the characters that no one can take either the characters or the lines they utter as realistic. Discussions on pop culture, politics, and feminism are discussed on the most superficial levels possible. For example, Celine hates her job, but argues about the importance of a woman having a job, because it's empowering? First of all, most women don't have that luxury; economically they are forced to work. Second, who argues that having a job that you feel exploited and hate is empowering? Gorbachev as an amazing statesman. Really? Wasn't he the charlatan who argued against the affordability of bread, destroyed the Soviet Union, and prostituted himself in Louis Vuitton commercials. If the writer had delved a little into politics beyond the superficial headlines maybe he would have known something about Gorbachev. The only likable scene in this whole film is at a banquet among friends. It is the only time you hear any meaningful or interesting banter and dialogue. Thanks of course to the writer ripping off lines from Bergman's film Private Confessions. My recommendation: don't rent this film unless you are a masochist.",Before Midnight

150,mmaggiano,Before Midnight,8,18 July 2016,"Before Midnight is the third of three movies, shot about a decade apart each, starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy as lovers with a very push-pull dynamic. It's not necessary to see the first two movies to follow Before Midnight. The movie features long takes (sometimes not cutting for 10 minutes at a time) the story takes place over a day, and dialogue and naturalistic acting are paramount. There's a complexity to their characters and relationship that refuses to fully romanticize or demonize them. It's something of a realist romance in (deliberate) contrast the beautiful settings. Careful viewers will notice a handful of ironies that ground the romance in reality. I won't give examples here, or go into the details that keep me from giving this a 9 or 10 as many critics do. The movie is the proverbial breath of fresh air, though. I'd say that the main weakness of the movie stems from its strengths, in that when artists set out to make something so true to human nature (as opposed to fluffier rom coms or Nicholas Sparks movies) it's easy to hear the (few) false notes that are played. There are very few; and unless you're jonesing for a mere-nonsense 'entertainment' movie, this movie should appeal to practically anyone.",Before Midnight

The play meandered languidly but inexorably towards a classic male chauvinist - feminist civilized if painful skirmish. There is a backdrop of parental guilt and angst as well as an interweaving of different philosophical points of view to make it really captivating. Just when you think that the script is fizzling out, the elephant in the room suddenly accelerates into a head on argument. The male point of view was presented consistently and credibly true to life. The frustration from continual rebuttal of honest love was exquisitely bitter sweet both when dealing with his son and as well with his partner. The woman questions why she is continually sacrificing her career by hanging on to a traditional ambitious paternalistic man and the different push and pull of duty and love for her and step kids. This is brought to a head with the sudden looming possibility of being forced to throw away a tantalizing job. This flips a resentful defensive feminist bitchiness switch. However the switch keeps wavering and turns out to be a heartfelt cry for help. Wonderful.",Before Midnight

That is exactly the first act of movie is about which sets a base for the coming acts. But in the climax it gets a little formulaic and that is why I gave it 9 stars.Unlike other two movies the conflict that is introduced here is not time it's disagreement of wife and husband over moving to Chicago.

153,FedRev,A definitive statement on love in the modern world,9,15 February 2015,"In 1995, Richard Linklater released Before Sunrise, and every nine years since has released a sequel. While sharing certain characteristics, each film is unique and worthwhile in their own right, but taken as a whole, this trilogy is something truly special. Some say that they are the best films about love and romantic relationships ever made, and they just might be. The series follows Jesse and Celine through the years. Jesse is an American traveling through Europe when he meets a French girl who is on her way home to Paris. They get to talking and Linklater's camera follows their conversation throughout the rest of that single day as the two fall in love. And every nine years, we revisit the couple at a different stage of life. Because of the time between the films we get the unique experience of watching two characters age, retaining the core of their personality, but taking on greater complexity as the years pass. The first film is about embracing the moment and forging a genuine human connection. The second film, Before Sunset, is about the regret of missed opportunities and the need to be true to yourself. The third film, Before Midnight, is about the consequences of actually getting what you want. Each film utilizes long takes which pull the audience deeply into the dialogue heavy narrative, and the fantastic performances by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy belie the fact that they're actually acting. These magical films are not to be missed.",Before Midnight
154,generationfilm,Before Midnight- A Logical and Equally Emotional Continuation of the Romantic Saga that is Uncomfortably Truthful and Painfully Heartfelt,9,29 May 2013,"Despite what idealized viewers might think when it comes to their beloved romance films there are numerous events and circumstances that can occur outside the frame that could strengthen, fracture, or challenge that particular relationship beyond the assumed happily ever after conclusion. This idea behind continued uncertainty is essentially called life and though the realist perspective might damage some optimist hopes there is a genuine beauty to the wonderful truth that is a relationship that cultivates or fissures in the face life's challenges. Eclectic filmmaker Richard Linklater, known for such diverse films such as his debut indie feature Slacker and his wide appeal comedy School of Rock, understood the idea of life beyond the ending credits once he reintroduced his two romantic leads Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) with a chance encounter in Before Sunset after their initial meeting nine years earlier in Before Sunrise. Before Midnight, the latest chapter of this ingenious film series, offers the creative staples that the romantic saga is known for with Linklater's consistently delicate observational style, Hawke and Delpy's engaged performances, philosophical witty banter relating to relationships, life, and more but this time unfolding the details of a relationship that has marinated beyond its initial romantic beginnings and changed into something far more palpable, strained, and relatable. The collaborative writing between Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy demonstrates their immense understanding of their created characters and deliver their most uncomfortably emotional and richly life-affirming vignette in this particular reflective road stop in the lives of Jesse and Celine. When poet John Keats wrote the famous last line ""truth is beauty, beauty truth"" in his poem ""An Ode to a Grecian Urn"" he realized that even the most unpleasant truths had intense beauty in its mere recognized existence and the Before saga is one of the purest cinematic exercises in revealing that kind of beautiful truth. Before Midnight takes the initially romantic setups in Before Sunrise and Before Sunset and expands them into their most logical and equally emotional prolongation where it expands the narrative strength, character vivacity, and philosophical importance of the series into a fully realized and painfully heartfelt whole that speaks uncomfortable truths in an engagingly entertaining way.Read more: http://wp.me/py8op-yV; more reviews: generationfilm.net",Before Midnight
155,pruthvishrathod,Awe Inspiring,9,4 January 2014,"This is one of the film series which always surpasses my expectations. After magnificent Before Sunset, I was not sure about the story can pursuit without being pretentious. But I believed in Linklater and he is indeed the man who does know how to carry on things without any mistake.I really loved the premise and this film surely recreates the magic of the preceding installments. It was great to watch Celine & Jesse finally together but more than anything I appreciate the fact that both of them have been shown matured in terms of their personality too apart from their age. It is really great how Linklater has so beautifully narrated two lives in just three films, in less than 300 minutes. And more than that their state of relationship has changed over the specific period of time. Set in Greece, once again cinematography is eye-catching but I lost in long walks and never-ending conversations. The experience was as refreshing as the one with Vienna. Moreover, the film deals with relationship problems at middle ages. Celine and Jesse are also faced with troubles just like any other couple. It shows even such an ideal couple also has to face certain problems.However, it once again ends beautifully with a sweet note. There might be another film nine years later or might not be.

That's where the proof of the director's greatness in creating a very realistic atmosphere.This trilogy before is a very beautiful and unique trilogy, if you digest and pay attention to this film carefully, this film has a lot of moral messages, especially the last quote from Jesse in Before Midnight which made Celine realize and cry.I can't say anything else, the point is you all have to do this trilogy.That's all from me, Bucek AlexsanderCheers.",Before Midnight

Every 3 minutes I felt like screaming ""Will you please SHUT UP!"" This is not a good sign. It reminded me of young me being stuck at the dinner table with boring self-castrated adults. Every now and then my imagination worked on how the movie would greatly improve if a tractor rammed into the (cliché cute) twins or if the roof collapsed on the old people at the lunch table. How about if the couple brought varying degree of bad luck everywhere they went but they didn't know it was their fault until it struck midnight and a giant meteor fell on their head? That alone would have kept my interest up instead of downward sloping.I think the yapping was way over the top this time and nothing really happened in the movie. It's crossed the line of truly annoying and irritating. Even the nude topless scene was too much and disconnected with the rest. I cannot connect with the characters, their life or the story. If that couple were my friends, I would never invite over and permanently hide their status updates on social networks.",Before Midnight

159,Edd-N-Furter,Before Midnight: and they lived happily ever after?,10,4 September 2014,"It's been nine years after Jesse and Celine met again in Paris. They are now married and have 2 daughters, Ella and Nina. Jesse continues his career as writer alternating with a job as a teacher and Celine faces several dilemmas about her work as an environmentalist. During their summer vacation in Greece, in which Jesse's eldest son (who resides in the United States) joins, what seems to be a respite from the routine of daily life, becomes a test their relationship. The endearing characters created in 1995 by Richard Linklater for Before Sunrise return to continue discussing life and its ups and downs, but this time away from the aura of idealism and romanticism present in both Sunrise and its sequel Before Sunset, to show what's usually unseen or is reflected superficially in most American productions: what happens in the lives of the protagonists after choosing to be together? And life itself is exactly what happens: marriage, children, work and all the responsibility they carry, and how often dilute the dreams and ambitions of youth and early adulthood. True to the style of its predecessors, Before Midnight plunges us into the world of Jesse and Celine through their talks, with dialogs loaded in this occasion with uncertainty about the future, much irony and even some regret and frustration for the past and the missed opportunities, as can be seen in the now famous hotel scene, in which a simple comment triggers a wave of complaints and repressed anger that comes to the surface. A moment somewhat uncomfortable to witness for the audience given its enormous realism. But it is not all tragedy and broken dreams, since the exceptional script by Linklater with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy (for which they received an Oscar nomination) has the ability to make us see that despite everything, there's still between Jesse and Celine, but maybe not with the intensity as when they met in Vienna almost 2 decades ago. And that love, like everything else, changes over time, either for good or bad, it can become a great affection or great boredom, all depends on how one learns to handle it. The success of this trilogy created by Linklater can (and should) also be attributed to Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, who over 18 years have grown in the same way as their characters. Needless to say that at this point they own and become Jesse and Celine in such an organic and natural way that sometimes gives the impression of watching a documentary on human relationships instead of a fictional story. Especially in Midnight both deliver the best performances of their careers so far; Hawke retains the same boyish charm as Jesse, but this time exposes his more vulnerable side admirably; Delpy gives Celine more neurosis than usual and while she's a little less sympathetic than in the past, all the anger that has been building for so long is completely understandable. With Before Midnight, Richard Linklater confirms his status as one of the most invigorating filmmakers of American cinema nowadays, from which we can just wait to see whether Jesse and Celine continue discussing life in a continuation of what might be called one of the most complete film trilogies made in years (and maybe decades).",Before Midnight
160,tomassparups,A wonderful conclusion,9,16 July 2013,"The final installment in Richard Linklater's ""Before"" trilogy, ""Before Midnight"" is finally in theaters after a unbearable wait for me. The first two films in the trilogy (""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"") are two of the best romance films that I have ever seen. Their simplicity and fantastic screen writing have made them modern classics in the world of cinema. In the first film we are introduced to two characters, Jessie, played by Ethan Hawke and Celine, played by Julie Delpy. They meet by circumstance whilst on a train heading to Vienna. After sparking up a conversation and quickly developing a bond, they decide to cancel their prior engagements and spend a night together in Vienna where they have conversations about life, world issues, love and so on. They spend a perfect night together, but the next day are forced to go their separate ways. Although, before leaving they promise to each other that they will meet in Vienna again in six months, they don't In the second film we see Jessie in Paris nine years later, now an accomplished writer. He has written a book depicting the events of that night with Celine in Vienna. During an interview in the famous bookstore ""Shakespeare and Company"" Celine stops by to congratulate Jessie's success. Much like in the first film, the two immediately create a bond, but this time spend a day together. In the final scene of the film, it is implied that Jessie stays with Celine in Paris despite now also being married and having a family. This leads us to the events of ""Before Midnight"". In the opening shot of the film we again see Jessie nine years later, dropping his son off at the airport after spending his summer with him in Greece. His son, Hank lives with his mother in the United States, who remains vindictive towards Jessie after he (you guessed it) left her for Celine. Jessie and Celine now have two twin daughters and are living a seemingly fulfilled life. They are staying with a famous writer who's beautiful villa sits on a peak next to the Mediterranean sea. Their vacation is coming to an end, so a Greek couple who they have befriended have rented them a room in a fancy hotel for a romantic night. After deciding to walk to the hotel, they start having the classic conversations that we all know so well.I will start of by saying that this is not only the best film in the trilogy, but the best film that I have seen this year so far. The conversations in ""Before Midnight"" feel a lot more mature than they did in the first film, as do the characters. The long shots and beautiful scenery reminded me how great the first two films were and made me love this one even more. Hawke and Delpy are great as always and the supporting cast is full of charmingly comical characters. Hawke's, Linklater's and Delpy's impeccable screenplay creates fresh new topics of discussion and is undoubtedly the film's greatest strong point. Jessie and Celine's love story is very heartfelt and does not come off as cheesy or clichéd. They go through their hardships, but in the end remember what is truly important. A great cinematic experience and a great love story. With the help of the smooth direction and fantastic acting, ""Before Midnight"" manages to perfectly pull off the conversations between the two main characters. They are at times philosophical, but just like the story, don't come off as cheesy.""Before Midnight"" is a treat for the eyes as well as an all around great movie. It builds off of the previous films to create the perfect ending to a trilogy. Whilst being fluffy and heartfelt, it does not feel cheap for one moment. The screenplay is perfect and the actors are great. What can I say? It's a must see film.",Before Midnight
161,DavidTL,After Perfection,10,4 July 2013,"We start off in Greece as Jesse drops his now 13-year-old son, Hank, off at the airport who is flying back home to Chicago after spending six weeks in Greek Peloponnese peninsula with Jesse and Celine and their two twin girls.Jesse has a great relationship with his son, but can't help but feel disconnected from his life as he lives across the ocean. He feels that he is missing out on Hank's life and at the same time of loving his life with Celine as he lives in Paris with her and their twin daughters, feels bad for missing out Hank's life. He knows if he went home instead of missing his flight he would be living a miserable life with his now ex-wife.Over dinner with their Greek friends, each friend has a long conversation about something that is all equally interesting to us as the audience. Humours conversations as they parody each other and emotional conversations about life and love. Raised wine glasses as they toast a few times on different subject matters that we would all toast ourselves if we had our own wine glasses.One of the friends, a young couple talk about how they met and stayed in contact even though were far apart which Jesse and Celine were interested in. They said they Skyped and talked loads over it, and even fell asleep on cam together. In other films, a popular culture reference like this would seem forced, but in this film it is relevant. Here we have 41-year-old Jesse and Celine who met in 1994 and re-met in 2003. Nine years of no contact. And then we have this young couple who because of modern technology were able to stay in contact. This reflects how times have changed and how ""Before Sunrise"" could only exist in the time it was made.As Jesse and Celine walk to a hotel suite that their friends have booked for them so they can have a night off and together away from their kids, they both talk deeply about love and life, what they regret and what they do not. As they get to the hotel they start to have sex but are interrupted from a phone call from Hank as he has arrived at the airport. Jesse signals to talk to him but Celine jokingly says 'good luck with your mom before hanging up. Jesse is annoyed that she said this as he feels she shouldn't say this to him, but she says he is old enough and that they have joked before about his mom. His mom is an alcoholic and apparently verbally abusive mother and hates Jesse and Celine. Hank at the airport told Jesse that she hates Daniel more than him, who we presume is her boyfriend. Celine can't stand her and wished that they had Hank to live with them. Jesse suggests that they move to Chicago and to be near him, but will only see him every other weekend and holidays, which Celine feels like is a waste and unfair, even though Jesse was only speaking mostly hypothetically.The couple start to argue, sometimes intense and other times humorously. With these two wonderful characters, who may be the best characters ever created. You can tell how different there are, you can predict each others next act just as they predict what the other person is going to do. You can tell Jesse will be more laid back and Celine will be argumentative while backing herself up. She is scared of change as she has said before and even said she was scared to come on this Greek holiday just in case of a new revolution.The film almost ends on yet another highly ambiguous ending after Celine storms out of the hotel room and doesn't return. Jesse looks around the room at items they almost used. Like wine poured in glasses. A tea Celine made but didn't drink. A messed up bed sheet as they almost had sex. In the previous two films we had similar shots as it reflects on the locations in the film before it ends, I was scared it was going to end here with Jesse alone in the hotel room, I was even prepared to shout out 'oh come on!' if we were left with an open-ended and ambiguous ending like the previous two. But luckily it cuts to Jesse walking up to Celine at a café outside on a peer. He pretends to be a stranger and chats her up which she doesn't like as she predicts he is being sweet again which will then end up with them loving each other and having sex, which she previously criticised for being always the same.While chatting up Celine, Jesse pretends to be a time traveller Jesse coming back from the future sent by Celine to tell her younger self her life will be fine. He pretends to read a letter from a napkin which she finds ridiculous at first before he tells her straight from his normal self that she pretends that life will be a fairy tale just like their daughters and life isn't like that without a few negative things, and that he loves her unconditionally and accepts every flaw of hers. She starts to cry, then mildly smiles and asks more about this letter. The camera slowly pans back as we see them get along again as Jesse reads Celine the letter from her future self.",Before Midnight
162,evehands,High hopes & expectations soOH dashed/disappointed!,6,9 November 2013,"I simply couldn't get past the inferior quality of this last (?) in the Celine & Jesse trilogy (?), having experienced the first two as truly delightful and exceptional movies (and quite innovative, also, IMO); in this, we are subjected to endless pontificating by comfortably upper-middle-class characters who have no relevance to the central story, presumably presenting different points of view regarding love, romance, marriage, mating & sex - something akin to the 'outtakes' of interviews with real-life couples in 'When Harry met Sally', subsequent to which triggers (seemingly) the leading characters' resentments, disappointments and dissatisfactionsnone of which in & unto itself is offensive - but what truly offends, is the apparent lack of emotional maturity of Celine & Jesse, now age 41, both well-educated and affluent, and with 20 years of hands-on life, love & parenting experience behind them! WTF?!? Where was evidence of almost any self-mastery resultant of self-knowledge in a couple who were extensively ruminating on life, love & relationships in their early '20s? I experienced little to no growth in either @ all; whilst she 'joked' of him, 'Great - so I'm with an American teenager', her own behaviour was no better! Yet they were already out of their teens when they first met, so whassup with this arrested development? Initially rather bored, I became simply dismayed by the way their discussion devolved into an argument with truly toxic 'zingers' delivered from both sides in ways which made my jaw drop = THIS is the best True Lovers can do? Such disrespectful ways of dealing with each others' feelingsI found it difficult to believe, they'd managed to stay together thru wind 'n weather THIS long?! Surely the first tenet of any successful relationship is knowing HOW to disagree - clearly, these two do notmore to the point, too much damage was done in the course of just one discourse (while on an idyllic vacation, to boot!) to make their True Love relationship believable; in fact, THAT is my overall criticism of this movie, i.e. while the first two were thoroughly and effortlessly believable, this third one felt frighteningly contrived by comparison. Really and truly, the only saving Grace of this whole mess was Jesse's summation right at the end regarding the contrast between the fairy tale of true love, and the reality thereof ('THIS is what true love looks like' - or words to that effect); if THAT sentiment could only have been the core and central departure point, the rest might have come together as easily (seemingly) as the other two movies. As-is, it left me disappointed and depressed! ;( (& presumably @ THIS rate - unless they get into couples counselling toute suite! - 'divorced' by the time the next 9 years rolls around?!)",Before Midnight
163,vikascoder,Coming from a huge fan of the first two: This movie is a Disaster!,5,7 June 2013,"I never thought I would say this. I am a huge fan of the first two movies and consider them to be one of the finest romances ever conceived and executed on the big screen. The third installment in the series destroys everything that you loved and cared about the two most fascinating and enchanting characters that were painstakingly built on a refreshing premise of two normal people exploring a world of stuff over a string of conversations over exotic locations.The Celine and Jesse you came to grow so close are nowhere to be seen here. Its appalling to see how poorly written these characters are this time around. The 9 years since the last movie seems to have ripped the soul out of these two beloved characters reducing them to a bickering, bitter and neurotic dime-a-dozen couple. The topic of most discussions are so bizarre that it appears a bunch of 18 year olds were forced to write a script from a perspective of 40 somethings. And why would they choose to mould these two in this fashion? What happened to the slightly larger than life motivations of these characters, that spirit, that aura that they had? Jesse and Celine were always special people. There is nothing special about the dried and drained personas that are on show here this time. There is absolutely no romance, no mystery, no nothing.And yeah the music sucks. One of the interesting things in Greece is a dog and a bunch of goats. The whole setup has a forced feeling.As I walked out of the screening I realized I didn't care anymore whether they will make a new installment. Jesse and Celine are forever lost to the realm of banality and mediocrity.What have you done Mr Linklater?",Before Midnight

165,lmitrani,Exploring the joys and pitfalls of long-time relationships,8,3 December 2014,"Before Midnight (6/13)Among the blockbuster movies lighting up & drowning out the Multiplexes is the small-budget, low-key Before Midnight. There are so many delights to experience with the characters. Sipping wine with friends at a beautiful villa adjourning the Mediterranean Coast on a lovely summer evening; discussing what matters, like career, family, relationships, past mistakes, the joys and pitfalls of relationships; characters who are appealing & attractive but with depth & substance. What else? Two gorgeous twin girls; an awkward but realistic conversation between a teenager and his estranged dad; explorations of how the tiniest of comments made off-handedly can be misinterpreted and lead to major crises for partners in a relationship. Ethan Hawke & Julia Delpy have great chemistry together on screen; each must decide if what they have is worth saving, or if moving on without the other would be better for each to fulfill their goals. Listening to snippets of spoken French adds to the film's authenticity. Each must deal with their guilts, Ethan for being an absent father, & Julia for abandoning her career to be with Ethan. What doesn't work? Some early dialog involves trivial issues that almost seem like filler, but quickly turns more meaningful. The pacing can be unusually slow at times, so much so that the movie would probably work just as well as a play where conversation taking center stage would be expected. While I did not see the first two parts of this trilogy, that was no disadvantage in enjoying this movie. There's certainly room for another in the series. Shall we call it After Midnight?",Before Midnight
166,BlairMcLovin,About a close to understanding an on screen couple as one can get,8,26 August 2013,"In Before Midnight and the two earlier films in this trilogy: Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, there comes a moment where the reality that what you're watching a film fades and you begin to accept that this is just two people in love spending time with one another. Perhaps it's the lack of cuts as well as drawn out dialogue scenes that subvert the subconscious knowledge that edits are a part of the cinematic language. The realism could also be attributed to Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke having played these characters twice already and hence thoroughly understanding their inner workings leading to a real continuity of how they behave scene to scene. Whatever it is, Before Midnight is one of those films that feel decidedly unfilm-like and because of this, is able to engage the viewer on a level that one doesn't usually allow films to do.After hearing of the announcement of this project I was skeptical of what more could be said on the subject of these two characters that hadn't already been thoroughly interrogated in the previous two entries. The film examines the couple 7 years after the events of the second film and fleshes out what happens after the initial thrill of young love has faded and the realities of married life (well, a civil union something or other) come to the fore. And although the film is is structurally the same as the two other films in that they are really just a small collection of long conversations, a strong case is made that these two characters still have a lot of things to say that are worth hearing.This is a film that's hard to fault and is in many ways superior to the previous two films in the series. The improvement comes primarily from the two actors continuing to understand how these characters' tick as well as Linklater improving as a writer and as a director in how he stages the scenes. I could take issue with sometimes feeling that the dialogue is too clever and long winded to be realistic or that I still don't really buy that Ethan Hawke as an author, but these are minor quibbles for a film that was a joy to watch. I'd recommend watching the first two films before watching this, but if you can't, whatever I'm not going to tell you how to live your life.",Before Midnight
167,diegosays,Juliet takes a crap!,10,27 April 2020,"If you are reading reviews to see if you will like the third installment of this beautiful story, know that, if you have a good taste for love stories, you'll be more than fine.
But you need to know, that this movie is hard to swallow, but that doesn't mean it isn't beautiful.
""Before Sunrise"" (1995) was one of the most beautiful movies I had ever seen, so I was a little bit nervous of disliking the next two installments.
But after finishing Jesse and Celine's story, I have no complaints.
Because it is the most realistic love story I have ever seen.
People who didn't like the second or the third movie, criticized Celine's behavior or said ""she got fat"" or were disappointed with the ending... they need to look in the mirror and see that there's no such thing as perfection.
If you wanted this movie to be about Jesse and Celine reuniting after another decade later and finally marry or something, let me tell you that you are going to have marriage troubles and probably have a very bad taste in movies.
But I am guilty myself, because at the beginning of the film, I thought Jesse was going to find Celine in the airport and spend a very romantic evening together and maybe finally, a very romantic sex scene in the last 20 minutes of the movie.
Thank god it wasn't like that.
In this movie, the princess got fat and the prince ain't good at sex as we thought.
In this movie, Juliet takes a crap as you can see the toilet paper in that plastic bag she's carrying and the comment she does while fighting with Jesse.
And I LOVED it.
Because it is real. Because that's what I want. I want my kids to know that Cinderella was maybe holding a fart while dancing with the prince.
And Richard Linklater wants to show people that, but some of them are to blind to see it because they want relationships like the ones they see on Instagram.
They don't want to accept that there's no such thing as a ""they lived happily ever after"" and finding out that Cinderella eventually got fat and couldn't fit in the shoe.
But this review is not for those kind of people.
This is for the ones who think the same way I do about that thing we call ""Love"".
Because it is not about a picture on the beach with a very good looking couple kissing with the sunset behind them.
This is about a true love.
Romeo has erectile dysfunction and Juliet farts in her sleep.
Too bad we may not know what happened after midnight.
Thank you, Linklater. For showing us a real love story.",Before Midnight
168,rajarpitara,"A conclusive and realistic, though not ideal, end to the trilogy.",9,23 September 2020,"Before Trilogy has nothing extraordinary to depict. It doesn't features any aliens attacking the planet, or the expensive CGI driving the plot. But it has its own reasons of being every bit as great as it is.As we go through the trilogy, one by one, we see two humans, fairly ordinary, evolve in love and life. First comes the young, enterprising love - full of passionate kisses and endearing moments. Then we move to a wiser and more responsible state of love in the second film. We get insights to career, life choices, and their effects on the characters. The third, and final film of the trilogy - Before Midnight - serves as a conclusive and realistic, tough not ideal, end to 18 years of character portrayals.As individuals move into their 40s, issues regarding children, career, love, and life penetrate the cutaneous layers and gain profoundity. In such transition, even a slight jab on the self-esteem of the partner can turn catastrophic. Before Midnight conveys all this without ever biasing with a character. Camera's neutrality is forever maintained.Like its predecessors, this film too uses long takes, minimalistic editing, and realistic dialogues to enhance our sense of connection with Jesse and Celine. It effectively uses just a single camera take to acquaint the viewers with all the major happenings of the past 9 years. It's so brilliantly written that not for a moment does it feels like a deliberately inserted piece of information.The argument sequence in the hotel is a work of genius. The intensity keeps on fluctuating as we dearly wish the fight to end. The fact that no one seems to have a clear edge over the other, relatively greater cuts in a movie fueled on long takes, insert shots, and a sense of claustrophobia enhance the tension of the sequence.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, who have also contributed to the screenplay, just command respect for their performances. Their portrayal of Jesse and Celine transcends what we call acting. Whether they fight or take digs at each other, walk down the streets of Greece or crack jokes, the sense of spontaneity is always there. They never look like acting.Before Midnight is a much heavier and darker film than its predecessors with greater subtext and thematic depth. But in all these turmoils, them being together at the end is beautiful, and that's how the how trilogy is - beautiful.",Before Midnight

This thing is awful. I skipped large parts of it. I must admit I did not know it was the third part of a trilogy. Perhaps if I cared about for these characters it would be different; like, lots worse. Perhaps that explains the 1 out of 10s. I can't blame them for giving it low marks. Seeing true love fall this far must be disheartening. These characters are stupid. They are not nice. They are not overly attractive. Hello, shave or don't but that stubble thing looks awful. I hate it when good movies go bad. Is anyone pleased with what George Lucas has done to ""Star Wars."" It's his movie, it's his right. I wanted more but I didn't promise to like it. Not good George.

Apprehension, because ""Before Sunset"" ended on such a perfect note and excitement to able to know more about the characters of Celine and Jesse.This time around, Celine and Jesse are older and understandably less enamored by the notion of everlasting love yet continue to seek it in one another. Their lives are less spontaneous and encumbered by responsibilities that age brings. But what is striking is the sense that as time passes and the novelty wears off, relationships require considerable effort which might not always yield commensurate returns.The film succeeds in capturing this tension and delves deeper into the characters - their insecurities and ambitions, in typical Linklater style, which is neither pretentious nor facile.

There is one quote here which is said by James which can describe the entire contents of the film here, namely; ""its not perfect, but its real"". This third film really reflects how you have to think realistically but still have to maintain a sense of romance between 2 lovebirds. I like how the depiction of James and Celine who are no longer young, when they are adults, there will be more misery than happiness, but that's what love means, how these 2 characters try to find a way from all problems.I always made mezmerise from the acting and chemistry of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. they managed to maintain the quality of their character's connection even though it was 20 years from the first film.

It is life itself, honest without concealing. When we saw Jesse and Celine as lovers with their in-depth discussions, well , in Before Midnight they are parents. They had their problems, they have children and all this day to day life is reflected in the movie. It looks like you are watching your own story, so real, so honest and with problems which occur in a 10 years marriage . Of course, being that honest and real, treating problems which you recognize can just be the reason for some not to like the movie. Personally I love it and when leaving the theater, and afterwards, you keep on that smile on you face, you talk about it.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are actors who are normally not in movies I like, but they are just fantastic in this trilogy. Not one remark on them, outstanding. The movie seems short, although it is one dialog. It is not boring at all. Of course there are no action shots, no thriller, nothing of that sort. It is a movie to pay attention to the dialogs and the situation. May be not that advisable to see shortly after a lunch or dinner and not recommended for strictly Action movie lovers.

I fail to understand why we didn't get anything but fighting and problems out of this one, as I don't think being this miserable is normal nor ok.I would have loved to see them in a happier, more relaxed light together while also having some of the drama.

As other reviewers have noted, it's almost like we've seen the actual chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy evolve over the years, as the acting is so natural, and they seem to hit all the real-world relationship issues on the head. Having gone through recent struggles in my own relationship, the emotions were especially hard-hitting and accurate for me. In Jesse, I saw a lot of myself - trying to be so calculated and rational about thoughts and decisions, all the while Celine is drowning there in front of him. It's all very real. I'm not positive that others who have not seen the other two movies, while not exactly a prerequisite, will have a grasp on the bigger spectrum of their relationship, but I don't think it hinders the story - though to be sure the moment the movie faded in I knew precisely who the boy was, and what they were doing at the airport.Overall, I give 'Before Midnight' the same high marks as the other two, and perhaps even above and beyond for really bringing a very real authenticity to the screen, of the labors of love, and two movie characters whom I absolutely adore.",Before Midnight
177,Indie_Locker,It may be the best of the trilogy.,9,15 August 2013,"Another nine years have passed in the lives of Jesse and Celine, and here we are, revisiting these characters once again. Its absolutely wonderful that Linklater and co. have managed to make these characters live on over the course of three decades, and in doing so they have left a distinct mark on the world of independent film. One thing that puzzled me before I even started the film was, why Before Midnight? Was it implying that one of them had to leave before the end of the day? And boy, I hoped that wasn't the case.This film, much like the other two, does not hold back in portraying these multi-dimensional characters in such an honest way. Here we are exposed to the entire spectrum of the relationship between these two characters, from their most romantic moments to their most wise observations. But just how honest could a story like this be told if we weren't exposed to the darker side of it all.?The realistic side, where relationships and commitment aren't all hunky-dory. Jesse and Celine are married with twin daughters and are in their early 40s. If this were a true fairy tale we wouldn't worry about them. But this isn't a fairy tale, and it may as well be real life.Everything about this film relies on the performances of its main characters, but luckily Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy absolutely nail it and give what may be the finest work of both of their careers. They make the material completely work, from beginning to end. They make us laugh and they both charm us much like they have before. They can fill our hearts, break them and put them back together in a single conversation, and that is true chemistry. Films of this nature only dream of capturing what they manage to capture here.All of that being said, this film is the most difficult to endure. For reasons I will not mention, both the characters and the audience are being tested with this film, mostly with choices and how our choices effect the lives we create for ourselves. We want nothing more than these two to work it out because they have that magic that some of us only dream of getting. And even they realize that keeping it together over the course of a lifetime is no easy task, for the walks of life like their jobs and their children only complicate what was once a much more simple matter.At the end of it all, Before Midnight is a film with a lot to say. It is full of delight and charm and emotion and connection as well as agreement and disagreement. My only hope is that we can revisit Jesse and Celine in nine more years to see where they are. It doesn't matter if they're in a good place or in a bad place, if you've seen the previous two films, you're in for the long haul with these characters. I think Mr. Linklater, Ms. Delpy and Mr. Hawke are as well, for not only have they created two fantastic and loving films, they hit a home run with this beautiful and mature third film, and continue to leave us fully satisfied yet also wanting more.",Before Midnight
178,valid908,Not fun or intriguing to watch as the previous two...,2,23 November 2013,"i am a fan of the previous series--- ""before sunrise"" - amazing.....and ""before sunset"" was OK not bad but this one ugh....a pain to watch. This couple turns into the bickering couple that they joked about on the train when they first met. There are no fun moments no connection or chemistry between these two anymore. it is like how they were talking about how they would be as older adults that became a self fulfilling prophecy.I do not get the 8.1 rating on this film. Who is rating this!? The producers!? Because obviously the fans are not pleased. Whatever charm was in the first two films does not exist in this one. I found myself not even paying attention after a point when you become so bored....the only really good moment is when they are watching the sun go down and say, ""still there"", ""still there""....and then its gone. Nice cinematic moment but otherwise, nothing.....I think they should make them break up and find themselves later as an elderly couple and fall back in love (and charm) again.... As a writer, yes this is what it needs. Right now it is dull as dishwater.... Please save this film series! Terrible and boring 3rd installment....",Before Midnight

She poured that rage into Jesse blaming him for everything; while he sat there accepting her and not judging her. Deep down he was grateful for what she taught him; after all ; she was the reason for his success.
She was aware of that and felt as if he took something from her. Normal.
After their arguments , Jesse went back to her trying to make her laugh. He loved her and still loves her; he read behind her angry feminist self. She was just a woman scattered by the reality of womanhood in which she didn't get to be passionate about things she loved anymore. He came back to her; he didn't let her go even when she told him i don't love u anymore.
He said he wasn't a do; he won't come back forever but he did that time.
I just love his patience and collectivism. That's what love looks like.",Before Midnight

I'am amazed at the high rates, I try to understand the arguments or the perspectives and I coudn't find any good support whatsoever. You may regard this in many artistic expressions, the ordinary, the plain, the simple, sometimes pass for the poetry of the day to day. This movie is just plain dull, that's it, you must not go further. The movie try to show us the difficulties of love in the 40, but they succeed only in the boring and the routine; the try to enchant us with Greece, but they didn't miss a single opportunity of the common image cliché; they want to show us how the beauty can't withstand the harshness of the routine, but in doing this they ruin the beauty, they ruin the wit, the love, the affinities, and they transform the harshness in pure stupidity.

181,ezr2061,IF You Don't Absolutely Adore This Movie I'm OK With That,6,25 May 2013,"I could've easily given this film 4 stars, I am that disappointed with it. But some of the acting, and some of the direction and editing, and the cinematography is good enough to raise it to 6 stars. My main overarching complaint with this film, and the two which preceded it, is that I just wasn't impressed with or even entertained by the dialog. Some of it is insightful and clever and relevant but it just seems to keep repeating in different words, in different modes, the same sentiment. So when the chatter - the endless, circuitous chatter that isn't one half as clever as it likes to think it is - finally subsides we are left with two very attractive, semi intelligent narcissists marveling at the tedium of their lives. I was initially fascinated by the intensity of their irksome self interest, but I soon tired of this. Delpy is breathtakingly gorgeous and a supremely talented actress and Ethan Hawke is likewise attractive and a genuinely compelling thespian, but the self fascinated, often tedious discourse was just too calculated, contrived and manipulative for no other reason than to impress me with its audacious theatricality. I was craving a genuine, mundane, real moment that wasn't so emphatically genuine, mundane, and real.The repeated times I audibly uttered such words as ""Oh c'mon!"" and ""Really?!"" and ""A-Doy!"" make me think I may possibly benefit from a few sessions with a gifted relationship therapist because every utterance of desire and disillusionment in this talk junkie's dream had me contemptuous of the very idea of anyone ever again attempting to pair up. I know this opinion is the opposite of popular but I must be candid and frank and honest with you good readers. In short - not for me.",Before Midnight
182,gt-thereelword,A simple masterpiece,9,16 July 2013,"The film is made up of a handful of long sequences that are no longer as positive or hopeful as those in the first two films. While it is safe to assume that Jesse and Celine still love each other, they are no longer in the exciting first stages of love. They have been together for almost ten years and the film explores their emotions that have accumulated over time. They have regrets. Regrets of dreams that were not chased and of words that were not said.The film builds to a confrontation in a hotel room that happens to be one of the most powerful and impressive scenes I've seen in cinema for a while. Brutal, funny, heartbreaking and honest. The equivalent of a bare-knuckle boxing match, Jesse and Celine decide to spill the beans on everything that they dislike about each other. Everything comes together beautifully. Staging, direction and performances working together for a tough scene, made all the more brutal by the desire we have for them to stay together.The aforementioned regrets and confrontation aside, Before Midnight still manages to be quite funny. Discussions on gender expectations, faithfulness, parenthood and sex provide some hilarious observations that many will be able to connect with. This is what ultimately makes the film work. Adults of all ages will be able to find a truth to hold on to. Neither Jesse or Celine is made out to be the bad-guy, which serves the film well. It's like eavesdropping on a couple's argument and being able to see both sides equally.In terms of performances, it will be hard to find others this year that match the ones delivered by Hawke and Delpy. Both actors are exceptional, holding the audience through some incredibly long takes. It must be terrifying to act out very long sequences of dialogue while trying to keep it looking natural and spontaneous, but they succeed admirably.Before Midnight can be painful, and at times brutal, in its attempt to give us an honest exploration of this relationship, but it still manages to be very romantic and quite funny. Richard Linklater and company have crafted a simple masterpiece here, providing insight and emotion in equal measure.www.thereelword.net",Before Midnight
183,Qrobur,Very fine writing in a relationship film,8,28 August 2014,"This is the third film in a trilogy the first two films of which I have not seen, so I'm assessing this as a film in its own right. Essentially a series of conversational set pieces, one an argument, heavily centred on the main characters Jesse and Celine, the film's strengths lie in its hyperreal dialogue and the depiction of a volatile relationship between two intelligent, emotional people. Interestingly, both I and the person with whom I watched this film felt we hadn't enjoyed it that much when it finished. However, 45 minutes later we realised we had been discussing it intensely without a break. Any film capable of that has something going for it.If you're looking for action, plot or sweet romance in a film probably this one isn't for you. If you want something about relationships that's realistic and thought-provoking, probably it is. Lastly, Julie Delphy's performance as Celine is superb and Ethan Hawke is a good counterfoil.",Before Midnight

Like many people who love this, I felt very connected with the 2 characters and felt like friends with them. Unlike the previous 2 where their encounters were serendipitous and fleeting, this movie opens with them as a couple, with children, and plethora of issues!I was in love with Celine's character; this beautiful, smart, funny, and confident girl. And she is totally gone in this film. She is now ugly, bitter, and insecure.The conversation which were the big part of this series, were uninteresting and constantly suggests insecurities on Celine's part. Jessie's character is unreal and unbelievable. I am not convinced with the ending.Julie Delpy couldn't even prepare to look good for this movie. While she isn't fat, she is so flabby. And what a great time to decide to want to go nude for this series. Is she having a midlife crisis? 40 year old women with children look great these days, not only celebrities. I try so hard to like her too (character, Celine). I waited and waited for the movie to unfold and was so sure it will wrap itself up and make me fall in love with it again, but no.",Before Midnight

The couple (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy who both co-wrote with Linklater) are now in their 40s and face some very real challenges to their menage. I started laughing and crying within about 3 minutes and both emotions kept up until the very end. Everyone sat through the credits so they could wipe their faces clean. Brilliant acting . . .This film gives one hope for the state of American film making and reminds you that Linklater is one of our most underrated auteurs.

Wish I could say I lived in France or Greece! ""Sunset"" is easily the best. Found it rewarding Hawke's passions, and years of wondering lead him to his lost love. It was exciting to imagine the 9 years we didn't see. I liked his character after loathing him in ""Sunrise"", but appreciated the romanticism of travel and ""what if?"" romance. Now here in the 3rd, Delpy is the annoying one, and this was boring. Perhaps this trilogy accomplished something, because I have mixed emotions about all 3 films over the span of 18 years. It certainly makes me think. Can't bash the film completely. But ""Sunset"" was the most rewarding, as was the last 1/2 hour of ""Sunrise"". This didn't have a hook other than the locations.

This film brings you back all memories of Jesse and Celine, and the story of 9 years after Before Sunset unfolds thru Jesse and Celine's conversation. They cleverly tell the story of what happened exactly after the ending of Before Sunset. (I would love to read Jesse's books! Have they ever thought of publishing them for real?) The dialogues are still witty and funny as always. Brilliant performance of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy! It did not look like they were acting at all. It's more like I was observing the real scenes, real argument, and I felt deeply engaged to them. I particularly like the hotel scene where their conversation flows so realistically and greatly reflects mindsets of men and women. (Though Celine is a bit too feminist. ;) ) I love the ending of this film as much as the ending of Before Sunset, which I regard as the best ending a film could ever have.

Walking in the ruins of Greece. I thought Ethan Hawk was wrong for the role. He always grows on me. Diversified man. I felt Julie Delpy was strong. She is resentful, sexy and gritty, pulverizing his words with her own. She gives in.... to be what she did not want to be. Servant, wife, tool. Maybe an unhappy ending would have more been more solid. A few of the lines in the movie I had to look up for their origin.

Just long contrived dialog that never ends. I'm completely flabbergasted that anyone would give this movie such high reviews. Clearly a case of the emperor's new clothes.

I WAS invested & a part of that r/ship, I was an active participant with all the feelings & emotional roller coaster ride that a long term r/ship at a crossroads can create inside you. We've followed this romance & r/ship for 18 years, so anything lesser in the direction & handling of this would have been a disaster. But the finale (if it is that) was just incredible & almost surreal. Bravo to Linklater, bravo to all the stars.9/10 for last hour (with a couple 10/10 moments in the conversation); 6/10 for the 1st 40mins, so 8/10 overall. Can't wait for when the couple are almost 50, which is where my wife & I are - I dealy hope Hawke & Delpy are around to do at least 1 more, to give all of us middle-aged going on old couples a look into our recent past & what could have been, what may be & perhaps what is.

193,AmandaSage,A beautiful blast from the past,10,14 April 2014,"Before Midnight is the third installment of the ongoing love story between American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and French Celine (Julie Delpy). First was 1995's Before Sunrise, in which the characters meet at age 23 and spend a blissful night wandering the streets of Vienna, talking endlessly and falling in love.Then, in 2004's Before Sunset, the couple reconnects for the first time since Vienna. They spend an evening wandering the streets of Paris, talking, of course, and discovering that Celine never found true love, Jesse is unhappily married (with a young son), and they probably shouldn't have parted nine years ago.Now, in Before Midnight, Jesse and Celine are 41 years old, living together in Paris and raising their twin daughters. We catch them at the tail end of a summer holiday in Greece. Jesse's 14-year-old son has just returned to Chicago, where he lives with his mother, and it quickly becomes clear, through more witty and winding conversation, that married life (or at least common-law marriage) has tested the strength of Jesse and Celine's commitment to one another.All the Before films have their charms and merits, and feature exceptional writing, acting and cinematography. But each one is more substantial than the last, and with good reason. The first is about falling in love; it should be the most frothy and fun. The second is about deciding whether to give the relationship a go. And the third is about trying to make good on that decision.It makes sense that Before Midnight is the one that sticks with you the longest and packs the biggest punch. Eighteen years in, and with more than one night's memories to build on, Jesse and Celine's story is weighted down by much more baggage, but it's richer because of it.There are moments in each of the movies that carried over for me through the years. In Before Sunrise, there's Jesse and Celine's make-believe phone call in a restaurant, or Delpy's perfectly delivered performance at the pinball machine, when Celine steals the conversation while staying totally focused on her game.In Before Sunset, the ending sealed the deal for me. It was so leading and provocative, you didn't need to see what was coming next. The film faded out on a fabulous note of anticipation.In Before Midnight, it's the lengthy conversation in a hotel room that left a lasting impression. The scene plays like a microcosm of Jesse and Celine's relationship. They take turns dodging and tackling feelings of comfort, love, resentment, inadequacy, verbally waltzing through the bitter and the sweet and back again in the space of minutes, sometimes only even seconds. It's an incredibly poignant look at married life, and so real and fluid that you almost forget you're watching a performance.I don't know of any other films, or even television shows, that present live-action characters over the span of 18 years. It's very special to be able to see these snapshots of Jesse and Celine's life, presented in near-real time and taken as the actors age. It creates the magical sense that these characters really exist; that, rather than catching a movie, you're actually catching up with old friends you don't see often enough. (There's even that trippy encounter you had several years back in Linklater's rotoscoped wonder, Waking Life.) The Before experience is even more special given that the snapshots are so well executed.Like its predecessors, Before Midnight has a hopeful but open-ended finish. Perhaps nine more years down the road, we'll be treated to another day, or night, or few hours, in the lives of Jesse and Celine. Here's hoping.",Before Midnight
194,svozil-706-642770,Coping with the epic dramaturgy,9,8 June 2013,"Unlike most reviews that seem to be expressing some hope, I believe there is no chance this choreography could, in real life, go on forever. Actually, I believe that, as expressed by Céline, this summer in Greece would mark the beginning of the end of their relationship. This is even more depressing, as the brilliant, gorgeous Greek light shines on them.The epic dramaturgy - as compared to the classical dramaturgy of the previous ""Before Sunrise/Sunset"" movies dominated by romantic love - exposed in this brilliant film is about the two characters getting somewhat tired of each other, slaving to their kids, and coping with the onset of aging.In such a situation, certain ""pathologies"" increasingly express themselves. In this case, it is Céline's almost hysterical, childish reactions to Jesse's desperation of having, for all practical purposes, to abandon his son; and her unwise lack of humility with which she is willing to abandon everything.Almost brutally the trio Delpy/Hawke/Linklater exposes Céline's acquisition of body weight, associated with becoming less physically attractive -- to be sure, Céline is still more attractive than most women of her generation, but not as eye-catching and mind-boggling as before. Céline's reaction to ""becoming a fatty"" (remember her remark in the 2nd, Sunset, movie?) is an aggressive stance toward Jesse. Jesse, on the other hand, is still very tied to, and co-dependent on Céline, and tries hard to fix their relationship with creativity. But he inevitably and ultimately must fail, at least outside of a movie setup.Unfortunately there is no way of fixing Jesse and Céline's relationship unless Céline improves her body mass index, and reacts more humbly and less hysterical. Alas, at least in real life, this is very unlikely to happen.So, I am afraid, in the next sequel - if this team continues in some configuration - we might see Jesse and Céline coping with their separation, and with increasing age and desperation - and ultimately with loneliness.",Before Midnight

Might as well throw in a few f-bombs, since they had the good sense to fall asleep anyway.

Life, even with your soul mates, does not guarantee worry-free or problem-free. There are still lots of sacrifices that need to be made. There are bound to be dissapointments, blaming and betrayal. Despite of all of these, as you grow old and mature, you understand no relationship is perfect. You yourself and your partner is no perfect either. It is the committment to the relationship and to the family, the embracing and acceptance of the other's flaws and shortcomings that sustains the relationship in the midst of all temaptations, and changes.At the end of the movie, Jesse said, ""This is not perfect. but this real"". The Before-trilogy shows us the true picture of the evolution of a relationship. It may start with a strong chemistry and connection that puts out heads in the clouds. But at the end, it is our own hard effort that keeps it alive.This is why I love the Before-trilog. I can truly relate to evey bit of it.",Before Midnight

However, in Boyhood and Nebraska in particular, there were deep surprises and twists that gradually unfold (I very much recommend these two).However, with Before Midnight, I was just completely bored.(Now I like it.)I hate at first watched more than half the movie waiting for it to ""begin."" It just seemed to drone on and on. Eventually I started skipping parts until I just watched the concluding few minutes. A dysfunctional marriage I thought, so what.However, the next day there were a few lines in the ending that left me curious. I backed up to when the fight (argument/middle of hotel room scene) really began. A lot poured and I watched it to its end, quite engrossed. Great acting. At that point I re-watched the dinner with guests scene and the walk up to the chapel. It was hugely more meaningful and rich having understood what was really underneath.This time I felt moved.

This was not the case here. Linklater had set up a story so boring, it could beat any love story that had ever been filmed. Ever. On top of it, he was so bored himself (and how it could be otherwise), that he attempted to tell it with a dozen or so scenes, made up from about 20 shots in all. The point is that today, nobody wants to watch a thirteen minutes scene from the same angle (the scene in the car for example), with a couple boring as hell, talking about their personal life and the kids, and their prospects, and the kids again, and so on. The thing that run on the screen, was not a film.

201,ianharrison747,Love or hate,9,17 March 2014,"With all three films in the trilogy I found myself being slowly drawn in and captured emotionally. I had already been slowly snared by Before Sunrise. The second viewing creates the addiction. I felt with all three films that I was a cross between a voyeur and an intellectual fly on the wall. I can understand how so many viewers will scream 'it was boring', All three films have a similar trait of slowly turning the screw and leaving you gently overhanging a precipice in the last scene. No guns, no explosions, no answer but a lot of questions. The realism of the dialogue is at times very unsettling. By the time we get to Before Midnight the characters have twisted and turned over 18 years. Moving from angelic to angst, hope to cynicism, freedom to entrapment. It is so uncomfortable especially when one has been through similar experiences. The parting of the 14 year old and father hits hard as does the sad reference to the supposed 'drunk mother from hell' with usual custody. Of course we should all know that it is never black or white and that is the beauty of this film. I was not initially convinced by the car scene and even felt like I was actually there at the dinner party as an embarrassed guest. They set the film up. By the time we get to the Billie goat walk, you should be hooked and the hotel scene,god that is scary. I am sure that anybody who respects the film will have been there, treading on eggshells, broken glass and avoiding emotional mines. Forget about liking it, the hotel scene is an acting and script masterclass.

202,SakowskyBrothers,"A great film, but let's hope this is it",6,11 November 2013,"I've felt that pushing it to a third film for this trilogy was asking too much already since the first two ended on such a great note. However with that being said Before Midnight ends with another great note, and hopefully it's conclusive movement in a trilogy.It has definitely been a great contemporary romance, as well as a true definition to realist film making. The takes are long, and the actors perform well in these static shots situated in one of so little places (mounted on the front of a car, etc). Again the film was more of character study over the ambitious plot points that push any blockbuster film. Not much happens but rather the development of a relationship, which is ultimately satisfying to watch for where it has gone over the years since we last seen the two characters.I'll admit that I generally don't like Ethan Hawk but in this film (as well as the previous two in the series) he has performed.This is one of those films you could batch with the independent fanfare films, so don't expect crane shots or other cinematographic maneuvers that will simply drop kick your visual expectations. It is what it is visually, it's a realist film where form is neglected to the point of invisibility, and as a result you witness the characters in all there glory without the (often necessary) satisfaction of great cinematography and / or (for the masses) special effects.Enjoy this film with the love in your life, and you won't regret it.",Before Midnight
203,rsd_anon,Boring Beyond Belief,5,12 November 2013,"I'm really perplexed by this film. I generally find that my impressions of a movie correlate very strongly with the IMDb rating. I generally find that any movie with a rating over 7.0 will be an absolute delight and anything over 8.0 will be an incredible movie. It was with great anticipation, therefore, that I rented this 8.1 movie. After 30 minutes, my wife and I agreed to start fast forwarding to see if anything was actually going to happen - it never did. This movie had the feeling of the thousands of forgettable French movies that center entirely on people having discussions in cafés. We generally love any movie with a rating above 7.0, but this movie was a complete disappointment for us.",Before Midnight
204,jrh-511-162275,Before Midnight...4 out of 4 Skittles,10,5 July 2013,"Usually when you hear the word trilogy in the film world you think about summer blockbusters with massive explosions, aliens and/or machines destroying earth and morons with performance enhanced muscles quickly driving expensive performance enhanced cars, but somehow Richard Linklater's (Bernie, Dazed and Confused) wonderfully touching Before series (Before Sunrise, Before Sunset & Before Midnight) has found a way to slip through the cracks.Just like he did with the first two films, Linklater brings us back into Jesse & Celine's evolving love story an astonishing nine years after the last chapter. For those of us 'Before' junkies sitting on the edge of our seats the past near decade wondering will theyor won't they make it happen now finally have our answer. And Linklater also quickly answers the question to those in the audience wondering if there is still a story left to tell.As is the case with the first two films, Before Midnight feels incredibly real. The script, which Linklater co-wrote with the two lead stars Ethan Hawke (Training Day, Sinister) & Julie Delpy (2 Days in New York, Broken Flowers), is nothing short of perfect. The three have found a way to write dialogue that is relatable to every human on the planet. The script is hilarious, but dramatically turns on a dime all while continuing to break the normal rules of Hollywood by being a ""talkie"" with extremely long scenes and minimal camera angles. Most filmmakers couldn't even dream of accomplishing what Linklater and company have perfected for the third straight time.Hawke and Delpy are brilliant and a revelation to watch. They embody Jesse & Celine with a realistic persona not found in many other films today. Whether it's because the two actors helped write their story, or if they've just lived inside these characters for so long is hard to saybut whatever the caseJesse & Celine may be the most realistic believable characters in the history of American cinema.By showcasing the flaws we all have, Before Midnight isn't always easy to watch, but it's pure honesty makes it the best movie of the year to date. Those looking for a sappy Hollywood love story may not be pleased with the honest reflection of life that the film provides, but fans of Jesse & Celine are sure to be pleased by the latest chapter and excited to see what happens in the next 9 years.

205,thevisitor967-526-781026,Not as good as the first two movies.,6,7 July 2013,"*** SPOILER ALERT ***IMO BEFORE MIDNIGHT seemed disjointed. It just seemed like it was trying to cover all the issues of a couple who had been married for a while. I think if it had just focused on one issue then it would've been a much stronger film. i found the beginning to be slow, unnecessary and frankly--boring. That conversation with the three couples around the dinner table I found particularly boring. I mean, I get what Linklater was trying to do. He wanted to show aspects of a relationship from three different age groups. But it just seemed so contrived and perfunctory. I really didn't start to get interested until the hotel room scene. But even that scene didn't seem focused enough. One minute they're making love and the next minute they're yelling at each other. Again, it just seemed so contrived. It just didn't seem to make sense why they decided to argue at that particular time of the day. And it wasn't just any ol' argument--it was a BIG argument!I think BEFORE MIDNIGHT tried to be like an Eric Rohmer film but wasn't as successful. The main problem may have been there wasn't a main point. For example, in SUMMER, the main point was a young woman who tried to go on vacation by herself without feeling lonely. In BOYFRIENDS AND GIRLFRIENDS, the main point was the difficulties of starting a career and a relationship with the right person. But what was the main point of BEFORE MIDNIGHT? A married couple takes a trip to Greece to discuss whether they should move to Chicago or not? That doesn't sound very interesting to me. I think BEFORE MIDNIGHT could've been a whole lot better than it actually was.",Before Midnight

You can get the sense of their background as it is themed as much of our own relationships. Myself at 38 the way, that, throughout the day they evolve into an argument is so real, so raw, it hits home. The chat between them is so natural, it never feels like a scripted dialogue. Though never boring IMO. In the end, similar to many of us, some go to the coffee shop to meet and ""bury the hatchet"" with our partner and hopefully solidify the relationship ...and others don't.",Before Midnight
207,mccarthyedits,Eavesdropping on a Middle Aged Couple,8,1 June 2014,"Last night, we watched ""Before Midnight"" (2013, dir. Richard Linklater), the third part of a trilogy written and directed by Richard Linklater who also wrote and directed ""Dazed and Confused"" (1993). I never saw the first two films of this trilogy and I don't think I needed to. The film stood on its own as a relevant coming of middle age film. This is a dialog film and the dialog spoke to me. Smart lines commented on marriage (or lack thereof), parenthood, divorce, careers, and aging amidst the pressures of modernity. Nothing seemed forced in this film. The actors brilliantly portrayed their characters in extended scenes and shots of conversation. This is difficult to achieve because the editor can't fix a missed line or camera mistake with a cut to something else. Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy, and director Linklater pulled off this technique with resounding skill which resulted in beautiful natural expression. All this juxtaposed to the beautiful sights and sounds of Greece. Next chance I have, I'm going! Did the Greek National Tourism Department have a hand in this production?",Before Midnight

209,thephaseshift,A tale of growing bitterness,7,13 August 2013,"I've been struggling to decide what I think of this movie...I thought the first two were great; I liked them even more the 2nd time I saw them. Both can be described as two people falling in love, as told through cleverly written but believable dialog.The third one decided to go down a darker alley of ""realism"" by showing us how even a fairy tale-ish couple can end up wringing each other's throats. I have to agree with another review I read: it almost played out like a list of ways how NOT to argue with your partner. It was just barely saved at the end by showing us one important method for recovering from an argument (having a sense of humor), but all in all it was a bit of a downer to see the lovebirds from the previous 2 movies in this bickering state.And I should add that for me personally, the whole scene with the dinner table conversations was a tiny bit annoying - too many different personalities sort of vying for attention, each trying to be more biting or clever than the last person, none quite convincing to me. I found myself thinking ""hey, we don't CARE about you people - let's get back to Jesse and Celine please!"" One could of course argue that the scene was about how they interacted with others and each other, bla bla bla...but in the end I didn't care much for the other characters.I also caught myself thinking that Celine had become extremely bitter and aggressive, and I felt more sorry for Jesse than for her. She came across as almost inconsolable and intolerable. What a drama queen...I wonder if this was intended, or if it's somehow influenced by Linklater's personal view of women (or some woman).I'm giving the movie a 7/10 strictly because it was generally very well played, and because the interactions between Jesse and Celine were very believable, even if less charming than they used to be. But it loses 1-2 points for breaking the mold defined by the previous movies and being less cheery. YES, I just wrote that! I actually think the charm of the 1st two movies was in their ability to create a genuinely romantic mood through believable and interesting dialog. Before Midnight shattered this dreamworld, and its appeal now lies purely in the cinematic aspects - but in the end it's just not as much fun to watch a couple squabble as to seduce each other.Hoping for a more cheerful continuation in a few years!",Before Midnight
210,dyak43,REALLY disappointing,4,29 July 2018,"The first film in this series was a great re-visit of the type of special chance meeting and shared experience that many of us live for in our youth. Pleasant characters, good chemistry, great to watch them explore a new city with interesting (and supportive) strangers. The second film was needed for closure - interesting enough, but more predictable. Nothing too special about the story, but well done and I enjoyed it. This last film was simply tedious and depressing. If not a part of this ongoing story, then I would not have sat through it all. I disagree strongly with the other reviewers who claim this represents realism and maturity. Not unless your life is filled with complaining and expectations that they world will work to serve you happiness. I don't want to include ""spoilers"" but suffice to say that Ethan Hawke's character was going way beyond most people's (realistic) tolerance to help a miserable situation, maybe due to the history he had with Delpy's character?",Before Midnight

Maybe self-absorbed writers and college professors with too much time and money on their hands find this haughty garbage worth wasting their time in their ivory towers? The first 15 minutes were simply an inane tête–à–tête single camera through the windshield driving through the albeit beautiful Greek countryside. Julie Delpy mis-spoke in English in the tiresome scene, at least this 'academic' film could have fixed that?

It seemed like this was doomed to fail. The characters are obviously so personal and deeply understood by Linklater/Delpy/Hawke though that once again they aren't betrayed in slightly. Nothing is stupid, nothing seems unreal. The humour of this one is great, despite the brutal subject matter and the whole film, especially that final act rips these two and your heart wide open. Loss and time are what this one's about. I'd happily revisit Jesse and Celine again in 2022 but if this is the last one we've closed the greatest cinematic trilogy of all time (up there with TOY STORY) by an actual mile.

The first two movies in this series were so charming and enjoyable. Getting through this one though was a tough, tough slog. There are no redeeming qualities whatsoever to either Jesse or Celine. Indeed, most of the movie is a case study in passive-aggressive behaviour - awash in bitterness, regrets and jealousies. The acting wasn't bad at all, but it is beyond anybody's talent to make these people seem even remotely interesting or enjoyable. Who wants to watch such a banal, petty, dysfunctional relationship where absurd arguments meander on and on ad nauseam? I kept fast forwarding in the hopes of finding a better movie - but, not to be.Why would the writers do such a disservice to the beautiful Celine in this third movie? They made her into an insufferable,sour, foul-mouthed, bitch. (sigh)",Before Midnight
214,mefisto222,Compressed in one room,5,20 January 2014,"I saw both prequels and enjoyed them very much. The highlights of the previous movies were a simple yet interesting plot, decent acting and matching location emphasizing the spirit of these movies. You can find all of this in ""Before Midnight"" again, but unfortunately in a very small dose. This small dose (approx. 30 min) is absolutely great but it cannot balance the rest of the movie.Watching first hour of the movie, I got a feeling, I was following a strange reality show about some couples having a nice holiday. From my perspective, the dialogs in that part are just pointless and not funny. The conversation got stuck somewhere between sexual obsession and sentimental trash (e.g. conversation at the table in the villa). Sometimes, I felt that the camera guy had forgot to stop the footage. No wonder, if someone left a theater.The movie got a little bit kick in the second part, though. The scene in the hotel room contains all of those ingredients, I expected from the movie: excellent acting, feeling of every detail in the conversation. This takes approx. 30 min. The final scene at the harbor is quite nice again, but just for 10 min and the movie is over. That's it.A very big disappointment in overall.",Before Midnight

In my opinion, Movies are a sort of escapism for people and when it gets too close to reality it gets depressing because Reality's often depressing. But I liked this movie very much for the same reason. It showed how love matures over time. The dining table conversation was a masterpiece. This movie is like How Celine says humans don't confine to one single meaning, they are multiple. A setting sun, for one person would mean happiness because he's just had a great day and he's grateful for this day but to another person it might be depressing because he's unhappy and the sun of joy in his life has set.

Celine ( Delpy) was once the sweet and fun girl to hang out with but now is just a bitter middle aged woman wanting to look good. It didn't seem to worry her 20 years ago. These 2 should have never got married completely ruined a good story. Could go on all day about how pretentious this story is.Still love Linklater films thank god his masterpiece Boyhood worked out well.

When Delpy and Hawke aren't arguing, they are throwing around cheap, pop culture observations about feminism, careerism, child rearing, divorce, literature and philosophy. The Greek scenery is just a silent backdrop to their incessant prattling. The movie could have as well been filmed in Peoria.

219,nmjones23,I loved the realism.,7,6 August 2013,"It has been quite a while since I saw this film, yet the same thoughts resonate it my mind, this film had a very delicate beauty about it. The film was nearly entirely about the dialogue. The beautiful scenery was breath-taking too. The majority of the film was set in a village named Kardamyli in Greece. The two lead characters converse about philosophy, nostalgia and what ifsfor the most part. The group dinner scene is a nice spectacle, funny, with just a simple layout of food, wine and communication.What I loved about this film was the realism about it. It felt as though we were peering in, on a day in their lives, rather than cutting between scenes, it was authentically done. It made me want to grab my loved ones and head to a hot country and walk through fields with our only our minds for entertainment. I will now proceed to watch the previous 2 films. In case I haven't mentioned it and you wish to know, it could be considered a tale about love, but it is no 'For Lovers Only', instead this film is about compromise, wishful thoughts and the woes of life.PS, I forgot to mention the actress Julie Delpy has this 'normal' look about her, as in she looks real and not fake, not like all the other actresses, and I felt like some applause should be given her.",Before Midnight
220,Pharmacat,Glimpse into the disappointment of middle age,7,4 August 2013,"I saw the first 2 in this series a long time ago, and having enjoyed them, I eagerly anticipated watching this in theaters for months. I went to theaters with a hunger for insight into relationships, tension as I vicariously experience the struggles of the characters, followed by a cathartic breakthrough. So what happened it? I came away liking, but not loving, it. There are things about this film everyone will like, such as the enchanting scenery, the idyllic ambiance of the Greek village/town in which much of it is set, and the authentic-seeming Greeks in supporting roles. I was impressed at how real the dialog between Jesse and Celine seems to be. I felt at times I was watching a real- life couple, which couldn't be more different from watching Hollywood films (which seem to be scripted by audience consensus of how men and women should talk to each other in movies). The 2 main characters are so at ease with each other, it's uncanny. Realize that the main thing this film shoots for is reality, as much as that can be achieved against the ridiculously postcard perfect backdrop of Grecian seaside. The first 2 films were romantic; this film is not a romance. Jesse/Ethan did not sweep me off my feet and I didn't want to be Celine. At times, I was annoyed with the 2 characters for not being more tender with each other; at times they seemed to bite each other, and defense mechanisms seemed to be at work. (Part of me enjoys that Hollywood script.) But I like the open- and whole-hearted, vulnerable, one million percent intensely romantic movie moments, so this is less a critique of the movie, and more a reflection of me. The film did make me wonder, is this the best there is after years of being with the one you love? It seems alright/nice, but is this worth making a movie about? Jesse & Celine, who fell in love instantly and who have gained countless fans cheering them on, settled into middle-aged mediocrity, sniping at each other and resorting to juvenile sarcasm/defensiveness when they feel unsure about the other, insecure about self? And what's with all the vulgar humor? As a fan of Woody Allen and When Harry met Sally, I admit I'm partial to a certain brand of wit and humor. That is, irony based on accurate observations about life, and less so vulgarity or sarcastic insults. I wasn't offended by the vulgarity, just somewhere between neutral to put off a little. Then again, since the aim of the film is reality, I have to concede that some people don't have wit, only vulgarity/sarcasm. But since this is the movies too, isn't the aim to please? The film could do a better job of portraying reality in a way we would more thoroughly enjoy, instead of giving us binoculars into the lives of a fairly interesting couple that we have caught at crucial moments, allowing us to hear dialog which is most revealing of who they are as a pair.The movie is full of surprises, and 1 insight I did come away with is how unstable the surface of a relationship can be, while the core itself may or may not be stable. It's easy to see the surface but not the core. The real question in this movie is, Are Jesse and Celine sustainable in middle-age? We all know that we want something sustainable; thus it is an important question for those who have cared about this movie couple for the last 2 movies. The movie pushes many boundaries in dialog; it is a movie for people who like talking, are interested in the meaning of conversation and how we use words in a 100 different ways to constantly alter how we relate to a person we are close to. So many times the audience gasped because of all the times a character said something that violated what we hold sacred and proper to caring for the heart of a person with whom we are close. By the end of the movie I was touched. And so glad I saw it. However, the movie does end very abruptly, and it is not a cathartic nor dramatic film. Like I said, it's reality. If you want heart-thumping drama and tears, watch Gladiator instead.",Before Midnight

Nearly the entire first 15 minutes is spent from a single camera angle focused on the characters in a car, just making rather mundane chit-chat. For 15 minutes. The camera doesn't move and the chitchat is mostly uninteresting. When we finally move to some beautiful Greek scenery, after a bit of a mildly interesting tour the the scene again decides to settle on another mundane scene where they arbitrarily chat about the main character's book ideas.

224,McHugh1,My Favourite Trilogy,10,12 June 2020,"There has never been a trilogy about romance and relationships like the Before Trilogy. I have watched all three many many times and recently purchased the Criterion box set.
Has there ever been a more multi talented and approriate trio then Linklater, Hawke and Delpy to bring this trilogy to life. Delpy has written a number of screenplays and directed movies. Hawke has written a number of novels and Linklater is without doubt one of the most original American directors with an interest in European cinema.
The dialog is so natural and flowing it's as if we are eavesdropping on Celine and Jessie from 1994 to 2013. These are realistic emotions and dialog and makes the dialog of big time romance movies like Titanic juvenile and laughable.
The acting of Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke is so good it doesn't appear that they are acting. I suspect that one of the reasons why is that they wrote the screenplay along with Linklater and parts of Celine and Jessie mirror their real life views on life and love.
The motivations and interests of Celine and Jessie maintain a continuity throughout all three films and the real life aging of Delpy and Hawke adds even more realism as they move from a fairytale romance to the reality of long term relationships.
The closing scene in Before Sunset which in my opinion is one of the greatest in the history of cinema had Nina Simone singing Just in Time. In Before Midnight their twin daughters are named Nina and Ella. I'm also thinking that Ella was named after Ella Fitzgerald. Isn't this what you would think Celine would name her daughters?",Before Midnight

I was astounded at the sheer realness of the way these films are presented. Real time, long shots, conversational dialogue, absence of plot, real locations. The films are one long conversation between two characters but it's just so engaging on a variety of levels. First the performances, which are made with such depth and magnitude. The chemistry between Hawke and Delpy is astonishing. It truly is hard to believe their not in love, although I'm sure there is love between them. They have a mutual respect for one another that really shows. You can feel the tension between them radiating off screen at times which makes the believability unquestionable. The writing is so rich with matter yet so naturalistic and justified. I was amazed that the basis of the trilogy was walking and talking, yet what Celine and Jesse talk about sums up, to me, everything life musters. And then add in the actual story these two characters share and Linklater has captured the complexity of life in a way I've never seen before. It's painfully real. There were so many subtle parallels within the writing which symbolised the 'passing through time' concept. Each scene ignited a sense of wonderment within me, causing me to ponder over my life showing the universal themes buried within the text.I watched the trilogy within 24 hours because I just found the whole piece of work to be utterly refreshing.

Literally painful to sit through. Abrasive characters to whom the viewer cannot bond, pointless, gratuitous sex-speak, irritatingly filmed in front of the two actors as they drove or walked toward the camera, bickering non-stop for the entire length of the film. We just wanted them to shut up. Somebody could have filmed us walking around for two hours, talking randomly, and it would have been a much better movie. Why do we want to hear these people spew dysfunctional drivel? Yeah, we get the message, but what a brutal delivery for the viewer to have to endure.

227,bluefire-6,I didn't buy it this time.,7,8 July 2013,"The acting was fine, the scenery lovely, but the lack of a narrative this time -- as opposed to Before Sunrise and Before Sunset -- started to rankle about 45 minutes in. Plus, people don't endlessly converse. They sit in quiet. They go off on chores, often separately. And they don't talk about the same issues endlessly, over 20 years. It was exhausting and at the same time, the conversation was cliché-ridden to the max. Lastly, Greece is still beautiful, but it is suffering mightily -- yet for all we know, it's still pastoral, home to modestly wealthy people living in beautiful retirement settings. We still know nothing about the main characters' respective homes in Chicago and Paris, except what little they tell us. All in all, much ado about nothing.The format has grown thin as the film's characters and its audience have grown older. The scripted conversation hasn't matured. It hasn't become more sophisticated or more real. It's still two 20somethings working out their youthful angst, only 20 years later with kids involved (somewhat, their presence almost ghostly). Plus, everyone in the Western developed world can remember with warmth their first loves and the disappointments, but not their 40s. Those were less certain times. The characters' predicaments are not necessarily our own in that period. I couldn't get into those portrayed in the film.Still, the lengthy film was over quickly enough, which is a tribute to the reality of the conversation per se. I left bemused, wondering if there will be another when the characters are in their 60s. I doubt it. If nothing's been resolved by then, a sequel would unimportant.",Before Midnight

Those moments that like a photograph within the mind can be held and looked at for years to come.Before Midnight however is like a sharp slap in the face, a reality of what could be if we followed another path.

230,biased_perspective,Exhausting...,4,19 November 2018,"If you are interested/able to listen to two people continually fight and tear each other down then this might be the film for you. I also found their relationship as two people together for as long as they are with 2 kids together to be unrealistic. They speak as if they just met and when they walk together, they do not hold hands (even when their arms touch). When you are having thoughtful conversations with your partner regarding your future and past, there is a connection there and this movie does not illustrate that. But again, you will find two people who literally bad mouth each other for well over half the movie. It felt like a bad therapy session that I had to witness.",Before Midnight

I then watched them, and I agreed.Now, it comes the third film in Richard Linklater, Ethan Hawke, and Julie Delpy's intimate and romantic series that follows the stories of lovers Jesse and Celine.You can watch ""Before Midnight"" and appreciate the film on its own right. But, I advise you to first see the two previous films (Sunrise and Sunset, in that order), before this one. Then you will understand that ""Before Midnight"" is a powerful film, but IMHO it could not be fully appreciated if you could not discover Jesse and Celine before.There is not much to say, but advise you to watch this film series to appreciate great acting, great stories and great original films.I really hope for this love story to continue. And I am sure that some of you may agree with me that these romantic films, may sometime be ranked as the best romantic film series of all time.",Before Midnight
232,claudiacscb,Painfully entertaining,8,24 July 2017,"The first time I watched Before Sunrise I was blown away by the movie's ability to hold my attention and to express a connection as well as it did purely through dialogue. However, the second time I watched it, the characters bothered me with their pretentiousness.This movie, I watched because I had seen the other two and although I no longer loved the two characters as I did the first time I saw it, I wanted to get some closure.I feared they wouldn't be happy in their marriage and every time I saw it in their eyes or in her reluctance to be affectionate, my heart ached. But the bluntness of this movie and how unforgiving it is is what makes it so good. I wanted to 'put it off' as much as both characters did; that is, the confrontation of their true feeling.Also, Delpy and Hawke are such brilliant, brilliant actors: they make these characters feel so real and make me love and relate to them but also hate them, in a great way. They make me pay attention to every detail of their physicality, facial expression and whatnot.I just really love this movie and its nuanced brilliance that engaged me throughout it all. I really can't wait for another sequel.",Before Midnight
233,kurronbhatt,"""Sometimes, you have to fight with your love in order to fight for it.""",10,8 June 2013,"Not having formally reviewed the previous masterpieces in the series, makes this effort as poignant as the story of Before Midnight itself. Perhaps, it is because I didn't have the opportunity to cherish the earlier ones on a big screen. But, I finally made it to this one at it's premiere at the Sydney Film Festival.If you loved Sunrise, felt Sunset, then you would want to live Midnight, as brutal as it is at times.I shall not spoil the specifics of the story because the scenes are the specifics. The general idea is that of a couple in their early forties trying hard to keep the spark alive despite their parental, moral and professional responsibilities taking a toll on their relationship.The inherent sub-themes are: 1. Jesse's craving to be able to be a sufficient father figure to his son from his previous marriage. 2. Celine's confusion regarding her professional endeavours. 3. Life in America vs life in Europe.The way Jesse tries to cope with and repair his past in the form of his son Hank, is extremely heart-wrenching. His literary ambitions take him beyond his imagination and into the realms of his personal crises becoming his true inspirations.Celine, troubled by the ethics and failures of her own ambitious ventures, resorts to pessimism regarding her maternal calibre and marital prospects.Contrary to the previous films, this one has few other characters with relatively more to do and say. Through their respective roles, the supporting cast did considerable justice to the story.As for the lead pair, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are yet again at their best, both in the acting and writing departments. They manage to make even the troubles of their respective characters desirable to viewers. They portray ways to deal with relationship issues with their own unique brand of natural cum realistic acting. Special mention - the long uncut scenes were marvellous.But of course, the ultimate glory belongs to the writing trio which further includes the captain himself, Richard Linklater. The ease with which they managed to suck the audiences into such a simple tale of a realistic relationship, is worth a standing ovation - that too, keeping the interest alive and elevating over a span of nearly two decades.Funny, charming, sad, realistic. Before Midnight will stay rooted within the minds of genuine viewers for as long as they shall believe in the power of realistic love.P.S.: Yes, I used the word 'realistic' four times in the review, since that is the USP of the series.",Before Midnight
234,kathyprice,Maybe a set-up for the next installment?,4,1 July 2013,"POSSIBLE SPOILERSI wasn't sure what I felt as I walked out of the movie theater. I had just watched this couple bicker for 2 hours. Somehow, I wasn't bored, and was not happy to see it end.The GoodAmazing long scenes with two masterful actors gave me a chance to appreciate their talent. Deply's Celine brought to mind a stern Hillary Clinton and Hawke's Jesse a bumbling, clueless dude. Bill Clinton? Hawke's angst over abandoning his teenage son in favor of this new woman and his new family will certainly resonate with so many men today. He used an example of Deply being late to pick up their young daughters from school and the panic she felt to explain how he feels that about his son all the time. Well played.The BadNo magic between the two, so little affection. The bickering and ""issues"" would have been easier to digest had there remained some kind of magical, lyrical love between them. We could have felt the tug between true passion and the burdens of real life and real conflict. As it sits now, all we have are the conflicts. Just stop, is what I was thinking.But Maybe . . . It could be that when the next installment arrives in 2022, the couple will have fallen love again. The daughters will be 16, perhaps in boarding school, the son from a first marriage will be a young man and maybe even presenting a grandchild. Who know if all of these characters will be alive? There could be a death, no? If the couple falls in love again, or becomes bonded again over tragedy, we could look back at this film as commentary on the burden that raising children is to a romantic relationship. If the couple are still together 9 years hence, and able to love more and bicker less, perhaps even showing compassion toward each other, we could all say: see, it's best to endure the tough times and let the love return.However, if this is to be the last movie of the series, not good. Very unsatisfying. I guess I'll reserve judgment on this installment until 2022. Time will tell.",Before Midnight

This is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever watched. It ruins all the romance, love, attraction and magic between this cute couple that was strongly felt in the first two films and I am frustrated mostly at that. The film is about some stupid dialogs and fights between two people who resent each other for ruining their lives (let alone love each other) and who have betrayed one another some time during their relationship. The more they speak, the more you feel that they never really loved one another. If the purpose of the film was to show that ""this is real life - there is no love that lasts. In the end, you see that every relationship turns into garbage"", well, they succeed in doing it in the most painfully boring and frustrating way. I wish they had not done this movie at all. I would have preferred to remember the unique love story of Celine and Jesse in the first 2 films... Unfortunately, they killed it already...",Before Midnight

You can have the greatest actors on earth and generic, dreary and forced dialogue won't be suddenly brilliant, insightful, and touching.Great films DO exist where the characters are meandering and where little but dialogue-even strained dialogue as they find themselves having-is there to carry a story. I love clever chatter and waited too long for too little-of 109 minutes less than 15 scattered about were worth keeping in the film! Were it not in a beautiful place, it would have NO worth apart from the younger couple being a bit of a refreshing break from Hawke&Delpy and the brief but brilliant(half-star-rating-improving) scene in the hotel&outside at its restaurant... It felt like they were stroking their egos with zero concern for anyone who might discern quality writing from a few merely ""authentic"" but still overly trite, contrived and flat out boring scenes full of drivel.Personally, I do not watch films to hear conversations legitimately less interesting than talking about laundry. NONE of it was insightful and they both look ragged and washed out INDIVIDUALLY-like he's been in and out of rehab for hard drugs for a decade and she's simply lost both her charm and any acting chops that perhaps were never even there-and I think both CAN act but seemed exhausted by the unoriginal garbage they had to make us believe&give two number of care about-do I want to watch a couple of potential neighbors be washed out, unclever, and unhappy in their marriage or do I want to see them actually problem solve and fire each other up without resorting to what is no better than faking orgasms for a decade-it doesn't actually make you happy so don't, and for goodness' sake don't try to get ten bucks from me so I can watch what felt like ""Before Counseling!"" The only thing I found cute or funny was a moment of ""bimbo"" talk that would be fine if not used to show off how much she hates perceived traits about him to others-which is just pathetic...The other problem is that everything they're discussing is far nearer to what couples in their late 20s go through&as a result it all feels fake and poorly cast, a bit like if you cast Clint Eastwood as a traditional father to a toddler and fifth grader without it being odd ie him trying to pull off 32. They say&look their ages but act like a couple of 28 year olds. Nothing meshes. It is tired, tedious and annoying. Don't waste the nearly two hours this requires-well, unless you want solace for a bad relationship and it'll get you role playing as them or pretending it's you in Greece. There are SO SO MANY better films out there. It should simply have never been produced, not with THIS script. I can't believe Linklater was at all involved let alone in charge-maybe HE needed to be in serious rehab when this was being storyboarded. Such a fabulous producer-I can only guess money trouble equaled pressure for a quick sale. Sad. I'm so glad I checked it out from a library since I'd be legitimately upset if I put my money directly into this when I'd get WAY more satisfaction buying a dozen homeless people a cheap meal or soap&toothpaste etc.",Before Midnight

And I can only tell you that if they were to release hundreds of sequel of them like this, I'm ready to watch them all. Never get bore of this. In fact, it gets even lovelier every time I watch it.The whole movie, including the earlier two, revolves around two lovers (Jesse & Celine) and their continuous chit-chats. These talks between them are so amazing and it's not very filmy ones, and that's the best part of it. It's like a rhythm which goes on and on and on... and it is beautiful to see these two lovers chat in such a lovely way. You'll enjoy watching them talk.One of the really good scenes from the movie was the chat at the dining table among these 2 lovers and their friends and couple of older ones. Certain good learning are also in it.Towards the very end of the movie, Jesse, even after a very bad fight with Celine, goes to her and tries his best to make her laugh - win her back again, while Celine still being adamant refuse to be listened to, but Jesse doesn't give up until the very end but then Celine understands the practicality of the situation they are in and she smiles and love restores. :)The moral of the movie which I found most useful, was to, never let go of your true lover no matter what happens, especially not out of some silly fight and anger, coz at the end you're one to lose. Try to be happy with the little little things that makes are life a wholesome...""If you want true love, then this is it, this is real life, it's not perfect but it's real, if you can't see it then you're blind."" - Jesse to Celine.",Before Midnight
239,bohem5,Depicts reality better than reality itself. Amazing.,10,6 April 2015,"Wow. That was my first thought when I first finished the film. I had held off watching the film for a long time because what I loved about Before Sunrise and Sunset was the idea of these two characters who love each other but are not really ""together."" That had always provided me this excitement and I knew in Before Midnight, the two would be having lives together. However, after watching it today, I can say it is actually my favourite one of the three.The reason is simple. It is so RAW and REAL. It is refreshing to watch those uplifting and funny romance comedies but sometimes, you really need a film like this to bring you down to Earth and wonder about the ""real"" life and love in real life. The film is beautiful in that it portrays both sides to the story. Normally in films, you find yourself relating to the character who's of the same gender. However, in this film, I could understand both sides and found myself ""witnessing"" human relationship as it happened. The hotel scene had me entranced. I could see myself in it (from my past experiences) and I could see myself in it also in the future. The ending.. was just heartbreaking and touching at the same time. It is a masterpiece. The setting, the atmosphere and the connection... everything was done perfectly. Thank you Richard Linklater for a wonderful piece of art that had me enlightened and wondering more about life and its meaning. Brilliant acting by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy too.",Before Midnight
240,sabrose,Self indulgent Dribble,1,12 May 2015,I unfortunately watched this movie hoping there would be something in it of some redeeming value. After all a movie two hours long without any major plot line or action should have some message . What I got was 2 unlikeable characters whose continuous rambling was noxious and uninteresting .Yes the modern Hollywood trend is to show heterosexual relationships in a bad light while espousing unwed marriage and homosexuality as wonderful things. One gets used to this trend and tolerates it if the rest of the movie is any good. If this is the liberal version of true love then marriage would cease to exist. The only reasonable thing in this movie was that at least it showed the angst that divorce causes when it comes to children.What a mess has been made of marriage by the left and the children harmed by self indulgent characters like these are an example for all to see. If one wants to see true artistry about the complexity of marital relationships and family watch Winter Sleep by the Turkish Director Ceylan. That movie is light years ahead of this pretentious farce.Looking at the preposterous positive reviews of this movie reminds me of people staring at a patch of yellow on the wall in a modern art museum remarking at its sophistication and brilliance only to be gently informed by the security guard that its a fade spot in the wallpaper .Monkey sees as monkey does.,Before Midnight

244,lobster1071,Too real for my taste,5,15 June 2013,"I was so happy a few days ago when I saw this movie was scheduled to be shown in my immediate area on the weekend. However, my happiness was quickly subdued today after watching it. Somewhere around the midpoint of the film, it went from grabbing me and having the possibility of being another great movie, to just becoming humdrum, harsh, and fairly whiny.I've read other reviews of this movie describing it to be ""honest"" and ""real"". That it's a true account of what would happen as time went on with this couple. Well, I don't know about anyone else, but I personally didn't fall in love with the previous two movies because of their honesty or realism. I went to lose myself in a romantic fantasy for a short time, and Before Midnight is very far from that. It's like it was a different genre altogether. Something along the lines of turning the Terminator into a musical comedy (well, maybe not that bad, but pretty darned close). If you're going to see it expecting to see a couple in love and longing for what lies ahead, prepare to be disappointed.Yes I thought the writing was good as usual. Delpy and Hawke did a great job with the lines they wrote and were given. The other actors seemed genuine and did a fabulous job. Even the child actors did a super job. The boy was believable, but I wish the twins had a little more dialogue and action (hats off to them for being still, behaved, and ""asleep"" during the 20 minute car ride, they were very cute).However, if I wanted to see and hear conversations from ""real"" couples and how they act after the energy and romance of courtship is over, I would simply look into any of my neighbors' windows at night. The only downside is that I might get arrested for that. As it stands, I just lost a few dollars on the ticket price. There was no mystery or imagination to this movie. For example, in Before Sunrise, you could imagine them making love in the park, there was no need to show it. In Before Sunset, you could imagine them making love in her apartment after he misses the plane, there was no need to show it. In Before Midnight, there is no imagination at all, she pulls down her top, takes off her underwear, and seems to do one quarter of the movie topless. No, it wasn't that long, but it seemed like it. At some point, I was even thinking, ""ok, we get you're topless, now cover up already"". It added nothing to the story, other than saying how blasé and loveless their relationship has become, and if that was the point, it frankly didn't make that interesting of a movie. Again, I see hatred and bitterness between ""real"" couples every day, why would I go pay to see the same thing? To be fair, I really didn't like Sunset the first time I saw it either. I thought it lost the charm of Sunrise, however, I quickly learned to love it. Before Midnight might possibly grow on me over time as well, but I certainly don't remember disliking Before Sunset this much. I initially remember it being OK, but just not up to par with the original. However, Before Midnight left me with a feeling of how nasty and cruel couples can be to one another when they supposedly love each other. If the creators' intentions were to make you feel badly after watching their move, well, they succeeded. It's just not something I'd pay for again, and if there happens to be yet another sequel, I would wait to watch it for free. With the combined talent of these three people (Delpy, Hawke, and Linklater), I think they certainly could have come up with something better.",Before Midnight
245,itszach94,Before Midnight,8,15 June 2013,"If you haven't seen Before Sunrise or Before Sunset, it is time, and then immediately after you are finished, go see Before Sunset. For those that have seen the two previous films, Before Midnight is a welcomed return to the relationship of Jesse and Celeine. The Before trilogy has always been a romance that has kept the fluff out. They are films that show the realistic, non-idyllic nature of love, and this film is no different. Again we see Jesse and Celeine walking the streets and conversing. In a traditional sense, nothing really happens, but this is not a boring film at all. Director Richard Linklater has such a talent for writing interesting, intelligent and real dialogue, and this dialogue is on showcase here. The conversations in this film are also far funnier than those of the first two films. We have know Jesse and Celeine for as long as they have known one another, since 1994. They know one another frontwards and backwards. Just like any relationship that has lasted this long, they start to become bored with one another and see flaws they did not see before. In the first film, they showed the optimistic nature of youth, in the second film, they began to become more grounded with their growing age, and in this film they have been through the long haul, and are much wiser and mature because of it. They both have real world problems now that they didn't have when they were nineteen. In this film we see the third part of the ever growing and evolving relationship of the two, and Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy play the two characters as well as they ever have before. Before Midnight is a very welcome addition to the now trilogy of films, and I would argue that it is just as good, if not better than the two previous entries. If you are a fan, like myself, there is no doubt you will love this film. If you aren't a fan, come-on seriously, its time to become one.",Before Midnight
246,theclarabellevilla,"Beautiful, frank portrayal of real love, lumps, bumps and all.",10,10 July 2013,"I was riveted from start to finish. The composition is artful and just as beguiling as Before Sunrise. In Before Sunrise, I found some of the scenes uncomfortable because of the emotional intimacy and accompanying bashfulness of the characters. To me this demonstrated the strength of the script, the composition and, of course, the acting. In Before Midnight, you get that same 'fly on the wall' feeling of intrusion but minus the innocence. Instead, you get to see the parts of relationships (perhaps even similar to yours)that (should) always happen in private and are rarely explored in as much depth as this on the silver screen. I feel like these films acknowledge the truth about people's experience of true love, with that rare follow through that is usually missing from the usual Hollywood ending. In Before Sunrise 'he' talks about how he'd like to make a film documentary of 24 hours in ordinary people's lives. All three of the trilogy are exactly that, and, I feel that this is the most insightful of the three, though less idealistically romantic. I felt privileged to be able to follow these characters, warts and all, through the various stages of their relationship. Despite the fabulous dialogue and excellent character portrayals, I wager many who see this film will understand the events differently as wide scope is left for interpretation and we are not spoon fed the characters' real motivations. This makes it a rich, intellectual and emotional film. Simply stunning and a real treat. *SPOILER* Some people have directed criticism at Julie Delpy for 'arguing at length with her breasts on display' and made remarks about her 'age'. Frankly, I think it adds to the honesty. Who hasn't had a blazing row in the buff before now? And also, the point at which she covers up marks a severe increase on the hostility of the argument, therefore a valid tool for portrayal. Regarding her age? She's in pretty good nick actually, but where do people get off making those remarks, anyhow?",Before Midnight
247,santanche,Before Midnight – Once you're Happy,10,23 December 2014,"In the end of a class the little Joana asks to her teacher: ""I'd like to know: once you're happy what happens? What comes next?"" Clarice Lispector, Near to the Wild Heart, 1998Whenever I see those ""easy"" happy endings I ask myself what comes next. And the Joana's question can be considered the summary of this movie: what happens after a happy ending. In some sense, several romantic movies create a mythology of quick and highly intense love, able to fulfill every space and solve any difference, simplifying the real long term challenges that will appear in the long road.When the director faced the challenge of telling what comes next in Before Midnight, he decided to follow the same and successful approach of the previous chapter: make the movie nine years after the last one, both in the movie and in the real world. This technique enables not only to have truly older characters, but also to exploit their maturity, life experience and world view.This movie shows us the real beauty of love, challenging the long road of the life; the friction and wear in the relations; the balance between our expectations and egoism against our generosity and impulse to share the experience of life. There is no final answer, no absolute right position and this leads to the question of acceptance or resignation, as well placed by Tim Lott.How love fights in the shades of human poverty is the beauty of this movie. This is much greater than bursts of intense passion in paradise moments. This perception deeply touches me and makes me to believe that there is something in love that transcends the human condition.",Before Midnight
248,sugar-abstinence,Disappointed,2,23 August 2013,"Before Midnight is something better erased from the memory. As a fan of Sunrise and Sunset (the latter upon viewing it several times), it was hard to swallow what was served in Midnight.Delpy and Hawke are both good actors, and they have returned to their respective roles well, but why has Celine turned into a bitter old woman, and Jesse into a selfish ass? They both displayed the seeds of these traits in Sunset, but in Midnight, all redeeming features have been deleted.Both characters could have walked out of a bad American sit-com. Enter a frustrated artist wife, who worries incessantly about her body and mothering skills, and is unfulfilled in numerous ways. Then add a guilt-ridden run-away father who talks like a teenager and acts supercilious in arguments. It's hard to like either of them, but you end up siding with Jesse, because Celine has become so hard as to be unbearable.The scenes in which Celine plays the bimbo, ostensibly to attract Jesse, are cringe-worthy. The final scene therefore deals a death blow to the series. The Celine of Sunrise and Sunset would never have dumbed herself down to be found attractive, probably not even in jest. She is out of love with Jesse completely, and it would have been more honest for her to suggest a permanent separation! Jesse on his part seems largely contemptuous of Celine, making numerous remarks about how he puts up with her, as if he's the only person in the world who could love her, and as if he has no qualities that might make him irksome at times.Content-wise, the conversations in this latest 'Before' film are of much lower quality. Gone are the deep revelations of inner truths, the pretentious thoughts of youth, and in its place are platitudes and sex jokes, with a great deal of sexism added. It's like Before meets American Pie, and it hurts.Better it is to imagine Jesse and Celine had a one night stand in Vienna, and a short fling in Paris, for Jesse to return to his son in the US.Linklater, here's a deal: I'll forget all about Midnight, and you'll stop murdering this series.",Before Midnight

You keep seeing signs of resolve but they continually resort back to fighting. It felt so painfully real and I bet any older couple that's been together longer than 4 or 5 years could relate to most of it. Additionally, all the conversation topics throughout the film are riveting and have you reflecting on the movie to give some of the topics a second thought. Just like the other two films. Originally I wasn't too happy with the addition of semi-prominent characters other than Jesse and Celine but after a couple of watches, I've grown to enjoy their role.

I have to say I am very happy with the result. Even though it's the third movie, they managed to keep it interesting, with smart dialogues still not missing from the script. It was really fascinating how they inserted Greek habits and parts of everyday life, without it seeming forced or unnecessary. I really liked how they presented the different ideas of love in each movie. ""Before Sunrise"" showing us young, innocent love, ""Before Sunset"" displaying the difficulties you face as an adult being confused about what you really want for your love life, and finally ""Before Midnight"". In this film they successfully introduce to the viewer the phase in two people's lives, where they have settled down and try to deal with some of the problems a married couple with kids could encounter.

Ethan Hawke's performance is brilliant in its own way, however, it's a less showy part and I'm not certain it'll get the recognition it deserves. The writing is astounding. Sharp, intelligent, biting, humorous, with staggering subtext, but most importantly--it feels real. If the screenplay doesn't get an Oscar nomination it would be a shame (the only thing stupider the Academy could do is have 15 best picture nominations.)Rick Linklater is now officially the Jedi master of indie filmmaking (Yoda Soderbergh actually said he's giving up filmmaking.) SLACKERS was only 22 years ago, and Linklater has matured into one of the most original filmic storytellers in the history of the medium. 95% of the movie is two-shots of people talking (the other 5% is people talking at a dinner table and cut aways to the gorgeous Greek landscape.) I don't know any other living filmmaker who could pull this off. There's a one-take during a car drive that lasts probably ten minutes (before a brief cut away), however, it goes on for probably another ten minutes (and Linklater said he could have kept the whole take, but needed to show ruins along the country side and cut away for script purposes, not performance.) There's a 30 minute scene of the two actors in a hotel room and I didn't even notice it (by that time I was so invested in the characters and their actions and emotions I wasn't even aware of time, it wasn't until the post screening Q&A that Linklater mentioned the actual time of the scene.) All three, Linklater, Delpy, and Hawke have matured into their rolls (writing, directing, acting) so easily that it's all just great fun for them and the audience. This is a must see for many reasons (including the history of film--there's only one other modern trilogy where the final film is the best--LOTR, and their food budget was probably more than the total cost of BEFORE MIDNIGHT.)i could go on gushing about this movie ad nauseum, however I'll finish by saying that BEFORE MIDNIGHT is what indie film making (and the Sundance Film Festival) is all about--truly original, creative, unique, interesting characters and their stories, told outside the Hollywood system, by people passionate about their craft (and in this case at the top of their craft).",Before Midnight
254,f-fris-1,Not a second of silence,1,30 November 2013,"The movie starts interesting when a father is giving his son 'good' advises. This is almost funny. But don't expect to see a funny movie. What follows is a dialog between the father and his new girlfriend and this dialog will only stop at the end of the film There is not one moment of peace or a moment of action in which words are not needed. The words goes on and on and on. I hoped at some moment the movie could become a bit funny like in the beginning, but you can forget that. And if the dialogs would play in an interesting surrounding, you could get a little distracted, but also that you can forget. We see two people quarreling in a boring hotel-room for more than half an hour. And don't expect witty dialogs; there ain't! Very, very boring.",Before Midnight
255,MelissaMonroe94,Too Realistic,5,27 June 2013,"We all know what happens to relationships over a period of time ― in the beginning there's sparks and excitement and this can then lead to falling in love, but eventually reality decides to kick in and years down the line life becomes nothing but routine and full of arguments. This of course is not the happiest thought in the world, so we turn to films to lighten the mood and bring back the belief of romantic love (which I strongly adhere to).I have adored the beautiful dream-like story of Jesse and Celine ever since I saw Before Sunrise ― meeting on a train in Vienna and taking a leap of faith, falling ""a little bit in love"" as they strolled around the city until morning where they vowed to meet again 6 months later. Of course we learn in Before Sunset that this did not happen, but fate brings them together once more, giving them a final chance at true love.Unfortunately, what I did not expect from Before Midnight was to be watching a couple I had admired for so long constantly argue for at least two thirds of this film, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth as I left the cinema. Agreed, the acting of course was undeniably good and the script was as always clever, funny and a little shocking, but this does not make up for the unsatisfying ending and having to see the couple I loved so much ridicule each other almost to death.Okay, maybe I have seen one too many fairy tales, but for me, watching something like this is completely illogical, especially since the main reason I go to see a movie in the first place is for escapism, not to get a reality check!",Before Midnight

Really superb. The acting was great. But there were some characters that their acting was just awful. It was driving me crazy. And there was a character that was too much of a ""sex addict"". The superb dialogs made it up, though. The writers could put the couple speaking for three hours straight in the same location and I would still love the movie. In the end I felt like it hadn't had an ending. I couldn't forgive a betrayal. And they both got along too much well for my taste. The location was also divine. Everything was great, but in my opinion there was too much conversations about sex.Although this was pretty good, I still prefer ""Before Sunrise"".",Before Midnight
257,oaaqua,So SoNot a romantic movie..,6,31 July 2013,"I watched the movie depending on the first 2 movies. But this movie is far different from the first 2 ones. First of all it is not a romantic story. It is a little bit depressing. You don't get the same feeling and enthusiasm like the first 2.Another point is that this one does not focus on Jesse and Celine as much as the formers. I think that the first 45 minutes were really boring and passed by waiting the movie to start the main subject. The stories of the other people at the dinner were not interesting and too long. The car scene which they travel to their hotels with the twins sleeping at the back was too long that made me feel uncomfortable. Since it shows us how beautiful the nature of Greece is I think people tend to like it. I mean if the movie was set in a regular city with no sea, beach and such authentic factors the rating of the movie would be less. Also Celine was presented more like a hysterical, nervous and irrational woman but in the first 2 movies she was not like that. But I must admit that the performances of both actors were really good. And dialog at the hotel was so real.So I think this one is 6.5 over 10.",Before Midnight
258,gartkle,"Wow, seems you either love it or hate it.",10,2 June 2014,"Has there ever been a film to split opinions as much as this? I loved it but I understand why many didn't so this review is for all of those who walked out, didn't get it, were bored senseless or were just 'disappointed' by this film. Firstly, I should say that I saw the previous two films in the last week (for the first time) and read a lot of negative reviews on here about the third film so was prepared to be disappointed. I think this is quite important because how many times have we gone to the cinema full of expectation and been disappointed and how many times have we gone expecting nothing and been pleasantly surprised? There's only one person to blame for that (or to be thankful for?) and I think a lot of people fell into the trap of expecting something amazing (it has an 8 rating so MUST be very good) and left frustrated for reasons I will explain.We all see things differently but that doesn't mean we can't change our opinions on something. I've watched things that people I respect have said was 'sooooo good' and been left dumbfounded. I went back to them to say ""what the hell? It was terrible, it was boring, all he did was complain for half an hour, where's the comedy in that?"" and was told ""yeah, I thought that at first and then I got it, give it time"". I then went back and watched the same episode again and the penny dropped, this time I loved it (Curb Your Enthusiasm). I've done that with music as well, only liked one track, the rest were poor. After playing it a dozen times, I loved all the other tracks but had gone off the one I first liked (Elvis Costello, My Aim Is True). These are two two examples where my initial thoughts/reactions were later completely changed...by myself!So this is my advice for all those that didn't get it. What you mustn't do:Do not see this movie WITHOUT seeing the first two. Anybody watching this movie based on the 8 review here without seeing the first two will sit down expecting to be entertained and will wonder what the hell they have walked into. It will make no sense at all and will bore you to tears.Do not see this movie having remembered how good the first two were, go and watch them again. This is slightly harder to explain. The films cover a period of 18 years and whilst the characters have aged in that time, so have you and that is actually quite important. A film you watched at 23 may seem very different to you at 41. For example, one of my favourite films is Chariots of Fire and when I was younger, I loved the Harold Abraham's character. I could identify with the young man, fighting against the system and recognise his desire to win at all costs. As I grew older I saw that I started to tire of his youthful exuberance and found myself agreeing more with the more thoughtful and respectful Eric Liddell. What I thought at 23 has changed as I've grown older (as Jesse also mentions) and maybe one of the reasons I 'get' this film is that I am now a forty something man, married with kids, ran my own business, separated, got back together, lived abroad etc and can associate a lot of what happens on screen with my own experiences. Maybe for younger people all they see is Jesse and Céline constantly arguing but I didn't see it that way at all. To me they were just having in- depth discussions (something I wished I'd had more of) whilst demonstrating that on some levels, we never really grow up and are always searching for something.Do not go to see this movie expecting it to be a continuation of the love story from the first two. How could it be? They had one day together in 1995 and another in 2004 and the final scene leaves you in no doubt that they will finally get together... and that's the end of the fairy-tale. In most Hollywood movies, it ends with the two protagonists falling into each other's arms and as the screen fades we are left telling ourselves ""...and they lived happily ever after"". That's the dream, the fantasy, it's what we've come to expect, almost demand but the reality is, when the screen fades we get real life, we get...Before Midnight. I'm not sure this film will appeal to those under 40 who are looking for a love story or a happy ending as it's not a 'standalone' film. Each film is as important as the next and must be seen together to fully understand Jesse and Celine. All three films are magnificent works of art that set the bar ridiculously high for others to follow. The first gives you the dream, the second the chance to make amends and the third takes the possibility of the 'happy ever after' and gives you the reality of it. But the story isn't over, she says she doesn't love him so we need to find out what love for Celine really means and we need to know how Jesse will deal with his split family responsibilities. Life goes on, the story isn't finished yet.",Before Midnight
259,pascalekab,Before Midnight is the best movie of the year following the legacy of Before Sunrise and Before Sunset.,10,24 July 2013,"Before midnight is the best movie of the year. Once more Richard Linklater make us explore the meaning of the true love and the difficulties that life can bring us with love, he achieved to direct a wonderful movie by presenting the beautiful places of Greece. The screenplay is absolutely amazing and very realistic, Richard Linklater, Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke achieved to present to us with their screenplay the meaning of true love and how their magical romance that we saw in Before Sunrise and in Before Sunset concludes to a usual marriage with its own problem that many people deal with in their daily life and they still struggling to find back their true love that they may have lost during their marriage. The cast of the movie is one more time excellent, Julie Delpy is better than any other time, she gives a flawless performance that should lead her to the Academy Awards. Ethan Hawke is also very good in his role and the rest of the cast did a great job, especially the great (well know for her movies back in '60s in Greece) Xenia Kalogeropoulou gives a sweet, touching performance that will remain in our memories. The soundtrack is also amazing, the song ''Gia ena tango'' sung by Haris Alexiou (one of the best singers in Greece) gives a sweet melody to the movie. Now, i can say that the trilogy (Before Sunrise,Before Sunset,Before Midnight) is the best trilogy ever made. Before Midnight totally deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay and a nomination for Best Leading Actress (Julie Delpy) and why not a nomination for Best Motion Picture. It is difficult to believe that the love story of Jesse and Celine ends with that movie, because these movies taught us many true things, like that even a romance that we think that it could only exist in movies, it can become a usual story like the marriages we meet every day with its own problems, but also with its own moments of happiness and with this movie we can understand the meaning of true love and the meaning of the family. To sum up, we have cried and we have felt the moments of happiness of the romance of Jesse and Celine and we hope that in another 9 years we will see another movie of their love and their family.",Before Midnight
260,Exxdee,On It's Own,9,18 August 2013,"There's something special about Before Midnight that captivates me so much. Maybe it's the truthfulness of Jesse & Celine or the well-drawn script in which scenes are shot with confidence and bright faithfulness or its just that Before Midnight is a representation of growing up, being parents, dedicating our lives for someone else. Before Midnight is so simple yet so complex, the Before series is an accomplishment for Julie Delpy, Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater. It makes you feel a range of relatable emotions. I'm glad that there are films like Before Midnight. It makes me wonder what extraordinary things the world can do. Bravo!",Before Midnight

I really looked forward to it but it was a disappointment and it lacked that flicker the other 2 had. Celine is truly unlikeable, frustrated and resentful, almost unbearable, how are we supposed to consider this? That this is what we turn into with age? But I don't watch a movie for that!I look for inspiration in a film, quality conversations, ingeniousness, great shots and that special feeling that life is a unique and marvelous gift. This film is lacking all of these. Had Celine ""tried"" a little, for sure she would have found things in her life to be grateful for. But her negativity makes the film lose important points.",Before Midnight
262,elainesanfey,Not as wonderful as the last one but definitely worth your time,9,22 June 2013,"I enjoyed Before Sunrise when I first saw it, and thought it was a clever, charming movie with an innovative approach. In my opinion though, Before Sunrise was vastly elevated by being paired with Before Sunset 9 years later.Before Sunset is an exceptional movie, much more melancholic than its predecessor, but understandably so because the characters had grown up and had to let go of childish notions of fairytale happy ever afters. What makes Before Sunset so wonderful though is the notion throughout that even though things went wrong it's never too late to fix them. Before Midnight is a different film to the previous two. In my opinion it is about two people who, having made the mistake of losing contact the first time, will work to make sure it never happens again. They were never going to have a fairytale life because they are both very complicated, and I liked the realism of how their relationship developed as they got older. I strongly disagree with other reviewers who say that Before Midnight can be watched without seeing the previous two. I criticised people who did that for Before Sunset and would caution against it even more for this one. Before Midnight relies on the idea that the audience understands how complicated the characters are and therefore continues to like them even when they do things which could seem nasty and shallow. In summary, while my favourite of the three movies remains Before Sunset, Before Midnight adds richly to the overarching story that has been told, in real time over 18 years, of two characters that fans of the series have grown to love. As a three part series, the Before movies are practically perfect.",Before Midnight

But we were so bored that, after about an hour, we decided our evening could be better spent. I wanted to leave after the scene in which the two characters are talking on a drive home from the airport, but decided to wait a little longer. It didn't get any better. We found the drama contrived, the characters unlikeable, the relationships conveyed stereotypical and the dialog lame. Blah blah blah about my book idea, blah blah blah about whether I should take the job with the guy who's a jerk, blah blah blah about how you keep a man (Answer: you let him win!). Not if that means moving to Chicago. Honestly, isn't this the 21st century?

There were scenes that lasted 20 minutes or longer where it had to have been all in one take because there was no camera angle change or anything. Its incredible. A perfect ending to the franchise? Maybe not. They did leave it open-ended, much like the other two films, but I don't know what they would even title a 4th movie: Before 3am? I have to say as much as I liked this movie though, I cant say that I have a favorite of any of the three. They are all incredibly unique in their own ways.

268,expressjordan,True breath of fresh air in a time full of poorly-written movies and cheap special effects,9,1 June 2013,"First and foremost, this is not your typical mainstream summer movie. However, if you're reading this, then I'm sure you've already seen the two preceding films, Before Sunrise and Before Sunset. If you have, then you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. This movie is driven by the characters and their dialog. No fancy special effects, no elaborate sets, no uber-popular actors to stuff in the movie to make people watch it. Just great dialog from two excellent actors.Now that that's out of the way, I was a little uninterested when hearing about this movie, that it was filmed in Greece. However, after seeing the film tonight, I find that the setting was quite lovely and really had little to do with the movie itself. The movie was more about how these two main characters are dealing with getting older and being parents, and how over time, your opinions about things and about each other can change.One thing I've always liked about these movies is the gritty realism of the two characters. Being an American myself, and previously having a French girlfriend (and living in France), I can totally relate to the two characters and the idiosyncrasies that are attributed to both of them in this story of their lives.This movie was, once again, a model example of good dialog and great characters! I was very happy to see this movie, and I'm glad to see the writers haven't lost their touch. This movie was written by not only the director, but also the two main actors, and this series is really their ""baby"" - you can tell much love and care went into these films, even though they are all shot very quickly and with a small budget.

Straight cruel. All the while, Jesse continuously tries to please her and compliment her. It's sickening. Celine's role in this film makes me downright angry.

He was in so much pain that even when he was marrying someone else, he still expected her to show up. And even while married, he never gave up hope he'd find her, and that's why he wrote the book. And now, years later she HATES the book. She always says it wasn't her in that book, she doesn't want to sign it etc. I think there was a reason why in the second movie she couldn't find anybody to marry. She's a deeply troubled person, and he's just a poor romantic who fell in love with her. I think in time she's going to leave him. And I think it's true, she doesn't love him anymore.

273,jcpurcena,Trilogy Before,9,6 June 2019,"Drafting a review of trilogy Before is an interesting task, because it is a movie ran in almost two decades. However, I never watched the series in chronological order. Maybe, because I am more mature, I was able to realize the subtleties of this work. Before Sunrise was released in 1995 and nine years later Before Sunset (2004) and lastly Before Midnight (2013). The first movie shows the meeting of Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Céline (Julie Delpy) on a train going to Vienna. The second movie they encounter in Paris. The third we meet them in Greece. Thus, we can follow a love story about a real relationship.Richard Linklater is considered a talented director of American independent films. Possibly a little remembered by The School of Rock and well-known by Boyhood. The budget for the three movies was $8,200,000. Although the film was produced every nine years; the plot always centered in two characters, which unfolds in a period of the day. In addition, the movie uses extensive dialogues and in some moments the couple is arguing. Impossible not to identify with these moments and not be close to one or both characters. Undoubtedly it is a movie more art than entertainment.I think it's a great movie. Sensitive and intimate in the right way. This allows us to create empathy for the characters.

I thoroughly enjoyed the first movie, the second was watchable, but this last one was horrible. I must say that the scenery was beautiful and Ethan Hawke did a wonderful job portraying his character believably in all three. If you are looking for a romantic movie or one with depth I wouldn't waste your time. It is a realistic movie but lacks the certain flair, creativity, and sense of romance that the first two possessed.

276,CowjammaWheezee,"Great movie, I think some people missed the point",8,14 June 2015,"I was reading through the reviews and I can't help but wonder how people can call themselves fans of the ""Before"" movie series but pan this one. This one brings us full circle, brings a bit of closure to the story, if you will. The first movie was about two young people meeting for the first time and having ideas, however far fetched and dumb they might have been, about the world and how love works, etc. But we loved it because people like the idea of love at first sight, meeting your soul mate, and what have you. The second one, well, come on, of course we wondered whatever happened to them. (By the way, Giantpanther, you claim to be a fan but you said they were to meet a year later and it was actually 6 months, but who pays that close attention to the details of a movie, right? A fan, perhaps?) I think people are missing the point with this installment. Life isn't peaches and cream. These two had an instant connection, but they lost touch because they were young and silly. But then they found one another again years later and wanted to make it work so badly, that they re-connected and got back together, with him moving to Europe and raising their kids, which you find out at the beginning of this movie. But the reality is that the more complex the people, especially with equally complex lives, the better the chance that their relationship might have been or might be a complete sham. I think they both hated the idea so much of being apart, that they got back together for being together's sake. But now they argue like every couple ever, and doubt themselves and their partner. Truth is Celine never saw herself settling down and being a housewife and mother, and she was imagining that that was exactly the path she was going to take by Jesse asking her to consider moving to the U.S. And due to this, she acted irrationally throughout the rest of the movie. Big life changing decisions impact relationships...no big mystery there. I loved this one, I thought it was well done and much wittier than Before Sunset, even though in some respects this one was more somber.

The couple is together, have children and have to face the stress and uncertainty of everyday living and figure out a way to keep the love alive. Their fairy tale suddenly got real.Curiously I feel in much the same way about the movie.Despite the great relevance of the themes and brilliant acting I feel like the magic has passed me by in this one. The themes seemed rehashed, the philosophical insights shallow and insignificant, the gender roles a cliché bordering on the unbearable, the plot monotonous and the overall perspective of things depressing.Perhaps it is a realistic portrayal and my impression solely a consequence of me growing older and becoming accustomed to a bit of philosophy.

280,strand2800,"'Midnight' beats 'Sunset' and 'Sunrise' on its relevance - truly a masterpiece in acting, story and script.",10,8 March 2013,"I was lucky enough to get tickets for the one of the Before Midnight- screenings at the Berlin Film Festival this year.Being a big fan of both Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, I was truly thrilled to see this new (last?) chapter of Jesse and Celine's relationship.To sum up the story shortly without spoiling too much, we meet Jesse and Celine 9 years after the events of Sunset. They are now a couple with a pair of twin daughters, and Jesse is struggling to adapt to the role of being a separated father for his son, Hank, having him fly several times back and forth between the United States and France, where Jesse lives with Celine and the daughters. On the last day of their vacation in Greece, Jesse and Celine are trying to find the spark in their relationship again - we are dealing with a couple, like so many others, who in their 'middleage crisis' start asking themselves ""where am I in my life, why do I live it this way, and does my husband/wife still love me?"".For me, the relevance of the film, is its force, along with of course the acting and the script, which Hawke and Delpy again have written together with Linklater. Hawke and Delpy are so much into their characters and you feel how deep their relationship is established - it feels very natural and just like watching a couple in the 21st century. We live in a world where couple's separate, find a new partner, get children, separates again, find a new partner, get new children again (maybe this is a bit extreme, but something like that). Both the husband and wife have jobs and their relationships are affected when suddenly, the only things they are dealing with his who gets the groceries, who picks up the children from the kindergarten etc., and the love and romance between one another slowly fades away. That's the relevance to the age we live in now, that is so strong in Midnight.I can highly recommend fans of the two first movies to see it, and if you are not familiar with the movies, you are certainly in for a treat! In my eyes, Midnight works very well for as an end to a trilogy, but the door is of course a little open for another sequel 9 years in the future (2022...?)Again, the acting is superb (the entire hotel scene is magnificent!), and dialog is so grounded, natural and strong and the film has relevance and could inspire a lot of couples struggling with their relationship to their partner.10/10",Before Midnight
281,poggycool,Enchanting dialogue and chemistry. One of my favorite trilogies.,9,16 July 2013,"I am a huge fan of the Before trilogy, and I've seen the first two countless times. I came into the third film with sky high expectations and I'm delighted to say they've all been met. The third film is without a doubt worthy of the Before prefix. It's incredible to think that this is a side project for the cast and director of the trilogy.The movie is a bit different from the first two as the characters now have children and the time for wandering beautiful historic cities isn't as easy to come by. This adds a lot to the plot line and provides some great dialogue and an in the beginning underlying tension between the two main characters. One of my favorite scenes in the movie is at the dinner table of one of Jesse's writer friends as him and Celine take passive aggressive jabs at each other's quirks amongst friends doing the same. This scene may sound unoriginal in a romance but the dinner table conversation is mysteriously enthralling and real. Enthralling dialogue is the bread and butter of the Before trilogy and the third film has no lack of it. If you're asking whether or not you should watch this movie, then the answer is a resounding yes. It's funny and sad and passionate and beautiful all at once. Oh, by the way, the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous in Before Midnight. The Grecian summer is a beautiful background to the intelligent conversation that comprises BM. So, watch this and be taken aback by consuming language and beautiful camera work.",Before Midnight

Now, I didn't have the benefit of watching the prequels, so maybe that has something to do with it. But I didn't see anything interesting about either of the 2 leading characters and only suffered through their first incredibly long & dull conversation waiting for the movie to get better. It didn't. The first night, I simply turned it off. It was that unbearable. Seeing the high rating again made me try it a second night. The second night, I kept nodding off after about 20 minutes. In moments of wakefulness, I could see that it never did get more interesting. I don't get what all the hype is about.",Before Midnight
283,hardy9719,"If there's another sequel after 9 years; 2022, I will be the first one in line to see it.",9,6 September 2014,"Normally we see, sequels are terrible but Before Midnight – third film in a chatty trilogy started almost 2 decades ago – is still as great as the earlier ones; Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004).The film reunifies director Linklater with his two actors and co- writers Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke, who, as Celine and Jesse, had their first transitory encounter on a Vienna-bound train in Before Sunrise (1995). In the second film, Before Sunset (2004), they met again when Celine showed up at a bookshop to see Jesse (now married) reading from his first novel (about their first encounter). The not so clear ending left their relationship temptingly graceful. But the big question on everyone's mind was; would Jesse go back to his wife and son, or make a fresh start with his lost love Celine?Spoiler Alert!Before Midnight answers that question. Jesse and Celine are now in their forties, raising twin daughters. We first see them with their family, driving back from the airport where Jesse has just seen off his teen-age son, Hank. It's a good opener. Where Jesse is nervous, but the boy is quite straightforward.The love twosomes of the past movies here give more ambitious scenes, especially where a lunch held by their Greek hosts and friends, all the three other couples symbolize the ages; old, at the endpoint of life; the middle-aged couple are as Jesse and Celine's; the young; with a different perception. This is purely an adult table, where they aren't afraid to say anything. They share, they talk, they discuss, they realize, they learn and they have fun on this 'table for adults' which I think was one of the best scenes from the movie. Followed by the traditional walk and talk scene, well that's where Linklater is greatly skilled, he'll show how easy and casual things should remain, even in a movie.This hither and thither is often very amusing, though it's followed by bitterness, resentment and regret. That is somewhat to do with different hopes. Celine is planning for a ""dream"" job in environmental politicization, and that she has given up on the musical career she might have pursued. At times, you hear sentences that are too flawlessly expressed for such an impulsive situation. Delpy and Hawke are so intensely dedicated in their characters that you forget whether they are actually acting or it's just a casual reality.What the film strongly expresses is the uncertainty of what will happen next. It's like an avid but delicate relationship, but that pleasuring moment when they watch at a slow falling sun towards the end saying ""still there still there gone"" gives a vague idea about what their future holds.I can highly recommend fans of the first two films to see it, and if you are not familiar with the previous ones, well you are absolutely in for a treat! In my opinion, Before Midnight was a faultless end to a great trilogy, but of course if there's another sequel after 9 years; 2022, I will be the first one in line to see it.",Before Midnight
284,preetishmohan-761-620101,"Maybe even better than Before Sunrise, in a way",9,14 December 2013,"Before Midnight is a good movie on it's own. But it needs the other two films to truly make it a great movie. Richard Linklater has made the perfect ending to this trilogy. We saw a couple falling in love in a day, full of romance and life. Then we had them losing each other, eventually finding their way back and getting together like they are meant to. But are they? As life catches up with them, will they be able to cope? To love each other as they though they would? This movie addresses the doubts that we all have. Is there something called true love - the one that would last forever? Or does it exist only in fairy-tales?",Before Midnight
285,pauricsha,Jesse and Celine?,6,22 August 2014,"I read an online review of Before Midnight where the reviewer made the case that in this third film of the ""Before"" trilogy, Celine had been reduced to a flat character. Behaving in ways that didn't square with the Celine we know from the first two films, and not to her credit. Believable thoughtful feminist Celine, for example, become stereotypical bitter feminist Celine. And that seems pretty right. I would argue, though, that Before Midnight reduces Jesse and Celine both to flat characters; but only for the fight scene. I've seen each film in the trilogy only once, so I should be cautious in my judgment, but my first impression on seeing this one was that we do see the ""real"" Jesse and Celine for most of it—still chatting away, debating, poking fun at each other, and now, figuring out middle-aged family life together—but in the hotel, and certainly by the end of the fight, they've been transformed into a familiar, almost clichéd, dysfunctional couple.Not that the real Jesse and Celine shouldn't deal with dysfunction, but if one thing has been established in their on-screen relationship, it's that they have always been able to talk to each other openly and for the most part, honestly. And perhaps more important, listen to each other. It's what makes their falling in love the day they meet believable. But in the hotel, they're simply not there. I can believe Jesse would cheat on Celine and not tell her, but I can't believe that when confronted, he would ignore her question, and respond essentially by accusing her of questioning his commitment. It's familiar, it's understandable, and sadly, it's predictably male. But is it Jesse?I can believe Celine would be bored, or seriously angry even, by Jesse's always having sex the same way, but would it take a fight for Celine to bring it up for the first time? Basically, in the hotel, this is not a communicating couple who love each other but are struggling through mutual feelings of resentment—this is a couple who may love each other, but have spent years bottling their resentment and then when the kids are gone, it explodes, and they're at each other's throats. Contemptuous, totally un-empathetic, and downright mean, both of them. It's like they haven't had a real conversation about their feelings in years. Jesse and Celine?So why? That's why I'm bummed. Whatever the intention—undoubtedly honest and thoughtful— of the director and actors, I believe they took an extraordinary couple brought together by extraordinary, yet believable, circumstances—in their communication, at least, maybe even a healthy example to follow—and waited as long as possible before revealing them to be actually pretty ordinary after all, and not as special as we thought. And maybe not even to be inspired by. :-(",Before Midnight
286,robbertzijlstra,I truly regret this,1,3 August 2013,"I went with my wife to theatre to just sit back and enjoy a romantic story, but this movie made no sense at all. This is not how couples interact, far from it. In my humble opinion, if you interact with each other in such an idiotic way, with dialogues that don't make sense, you would end up separated or in an asylum. The way the story developed was ridiculous and you could see the main actors had to do a hard thing to make the relationship look real; it was all to obvious. As for the table scene: I have never witnessed such an awkward dialogues among the actors involved, I felt even embarrassed watching it. The movie itself was an absolute torture to sit through. My advice is, when they even try to consider another sequel, look at your own life before writing such an stupid script.",Before Midnight

The dinner scene is portrayed very well with all of the actors seeming to be very relaxed and friends for a long time.

I didn't know this was a sequel at all, or rather, I didn't even know there is Jesse and Celine, what is the movie all about.

289,sofia-lysell,A somewhat confusing but still satisfying combination of hope and complete panic about the future.,6,24 March 2014,"After watching the first movie Before Sunrise (1995) I kinda fell in love with the characters. Their youth, naive thoughts, free minds, open hearts. They were talking about their fears and hopes for the future in a way that made feel somewhat uncomfortable for the brutal honesty but still relieved by the fact that nothing was kept a secret. Nothing romanticized. There were some quotes that got right in to my heart like a knife, making me terrified. Thoughts I've had but never wanted to admit. Like in the pub were Jesse tells Celine that ""I kind of see this all love as this, escape for two people who don't know how to be alone. People always talk about how love is this totally unselfish, giving thing, but if you think about it, there's nothing more selfish."" So, I followed by watching Before Sunset (2004) and liked it. I was impressed by the love they shared but still having the ability to live their life without each other. Celine not showing up at the train station was a big mystery for me, since I thought she was the hopeless romantic. The twist surprised me, but made me question this as a true love story. Over all the movie was good, and the end made me feel like, well, maybe there is something more to it. Before Midnight turned to be a movie about something completely different, about a life of searching for something that could never be found. To me It's about two people looking for a life they will never find, ending up being lonely with each other. Especially when it comes to Celine, who seems to doubt her love for Jesse more and more during the third film. Jesse on the other hand, seems to get deeper into the relationship every time he opens his mouth to speak, although there's not much space left for him in Before Midnight (completely occupied by Celine) It's something that really scares me when she suddenly starts to panic over how her life turned out. This is a trilogy that contains answers to questions you never dare to ask. It gives you hope, it steals hope. Gave me butterflies and panic at the same time. It's hard to tell if the life and relationship of Jesse and Celine is everything i dream of or everything I fear.",Before Midnight

It is a easy path to take on romance but it needs courage and conviction to take the truth and reality even it bites you and thats what Richard Linklater, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy decides to do. Similar to its predecessor, this movie also has very long shots with natural dialogues and the acting of both the lead actors is of top class with Julie having a slight hedge compared to Ethan.

291,Auriss,I'm impressed...,10,7 October 2013,"This story started in 1994, with two young people meeting and falling in love, and continued in 2004 when they found each other after losing touch for a long time. Now here we are in 2003, in what it appears to be the end of this trilogy. The once young couple has grown older and is still madly in love. What I really like about this movie is the simplicity. People are always looking for the extraordinary in everything and they forget how surprising daily life can be. They forget about the magic of an ordinary conversation, when you talk about nothing and everything at the same time. They forget about the real connection between two persons. This is what this movie is about. Sharing simple things, arguing about life and time and changes, but still be together in finding a solution. It shows how to hold on and hold tight, tolerate, find a common language that makes everything easier.I wasn't expecting this third movie about Jesse and Celine, and I was really curious. One thing I can tell : I wasn't expecting this. The characters were more mature, and the lines more interesting. I also liked the supporting characters's part and the place it was set. This movie showed us their real life as a couple. You don't 'want to miss it, but if you haven't, start with the first ones.",Before Midnight
292,hemthefugitive,The Third Gem,9,12 June 2014,"Richard Linklater. I remember this name from the movie ""Waking Life"". Thoroughly thought provoking and extremely rich in dialogue. The best kind.When I knew ""Before Sunrise"" came from the same director,it didn't surprise me a bit. Few movies have reached the level of perfection that this trilogy achieved. And a lot fewer of which have done it with just the dialogue and acting. You know a movie is perfect when at the end of it,you find it very difficult to believe that what you just saw was acting.In roles that seemed made solely for them,Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy prove me wrong by starring in sequels that are better than the last one. ""Before Midnight"" fast forwards from the beginning of the relationship where ""Before Sunset"" left off into the realities of the couple's relationship. The opening scene with their conversation in the car shows the effortless chemistry between but also shows us that they've been through quite a lot.This also opens the argument between them that formed the entire spine of the movie. This flows into the second part which is a lunch with the people they are staying with in Paris. The conversation flows freely from masculinity and femininity to virtual sex of the future. Everything coming from everyone seems effortless. The argument between Jess and Celine flares up again but only briefly.The thing that makes the conversation seem so not staged is how everyone overlaps and interrupts the other and not as if on cue.Next is the scene at the hotel where the fight finally blows up. If there was a better fight i have seen on screen,I don't remember it. Years of baggage and insecurities are thrown at each other. Hurtful things are said. The fight falls and rises again. Celine storms out and comes back in. Twice. It was beautiful to watch.""You're nuts!"",Jesse yells and i couldn't agree more with him. Delpy played the strong willed albeit a little insecure woman to perfection. It doesn't end in reconciliation as you might expect but with Celine storming out for the final time after declaring she have no love for him any more. It comes down to Jesse to bring her back and this is the scene where we see the old Jesse who convinced a woman he just met to get off a train with him. He delivers it awkwardly but naturally.He turns her around and makes her come to him. I couldn't ask more a more perfect ending.",Before Midnight

I read about Before Sunrise in a magazine on an airplane. It was under the title of ""memorable road movies"". The story sounded good, poster seemed nice, place was Europe, I had always liked road movies and Ethan Hawke. Obviously, I would like the movie. Then I saw it. Then I loved it, I felt it!

Two idealist, passionate young individuals, connection between them...The dialogs that made you feel like the protagonists were real, the moments that made you feel intensely, think deeply... Vienna was beautiful, so were Jesse and Celine...Not much after seeing Before Sunrise, I watched Before Sunset. A naive masterpiece, this time in Paris. Celine and Jesse were even more beautiful.

The first and the third movies, have a very different meaning from each other, the second being the perfect transition between the two. The characters in the third movie became the couple that started the entire action in the first movie, here referring to the German speaking couple having a midlife crisis type argument. As Ethan Hawke himself describes the movies: ""Before Sunrise as a film about what might be, Before Sunset as a film about what could or should be, and Before Midnight as a film about what is"", I also think that the first one represents the dream, and the third one the reality (the second being like a lucid dream, where you are not sure which realm you are on).
But for most of us it doesn't matter whether it's a dream or whether it's reality. The most significant thing it's that both characters took the chance, in each movie and in each crossroad, and missed what could've been the golden bullet of their story: regret.",Before Midnight

But when the credits rolled on this film, I literally gave the screen the finger. I wanted adult fare. But instead, I got whiny, adolescents in adult bodies, with dialog cribbed almost entirely from vapid self-help books. Heck, if the author of ""Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus"" were listed as one of the screenwriters, I would not have been surprised. This film is actually quite an accomplishment. It's an uber-pretentious, windy, art house movie that actually never says anything of value or importance. It's not even absurdist. It doesn't cover new ground in terms of limning the angst of middle age and thwarted ambition. Instead, it was as if a committee of twenty-something creative writing majors got together and said, ""Hey, let's figure out how forty-year-old married couples think and act. They're all dispirited burnouts, right?"" Where do I start? Let's try the clumsy dialog. If the screenwriter were being paid by the word, I would better understand. But the movie is talk, talk, talk, talk without resolution. It's Waiting For Godot or a Woody Allen movie without the wit. It's Edward Albee without guts. And let's not dignify this as a deep exploration of character, either, for the two main characters are practically templates out of the screen writing academy: The wife fits the cliché role of the bitter harpy with thwarted ambition, and the husband is a self-absorbed nebbish. And both of them just babble on endlessly without either listening to the other. What's more, the ending is so glib, it's apparent that the writers painted themselves into a corner and needed a cheap and facile way to extricate the characters. Seriously, the ending would even be an embarrassment to a Katherine Heigl romantic comedy. Lazy, lazy, lazy. In the end, it is a movie that is in love with the sound of its own voice. And although the two leads actually do a competent job with the script, one is never transported in this film. One is always aware that one is watching a movie. Even the incredibly long takes begin to work against it (That being said, kudos to the SteadiCam guy). Because all the ten-minute set pieces do is highlight how little is actually being said in all the blather.

I don't have a problem with them exploring reality, my problem was with the way they portrayed Julie Delpy's character. She was a tad flaky in the first two, but it was a lovable ""Annie Hall"" type of flaky. In this one she comes off as whiny, bitter, and almost unlikable. This may be a stretch, but I couldn't help thinking that Linklater had actually lived this story and was giving us a version seen strictly from the male perspective.

303,janetmoviereviewer,I hated this movie.,1,13 July 2013,"I hated this movie. The actors and actresses did a really great job, though the plot was problematic. The story dealt with arguments during marriage, though the fighting was really nasty and this couple should have ended their marriage in a divorce. Arguments do happen within marriage, though the relationship should be considered a partnership. Couples need to be conscious of the fact that fighting too harshly can result in damage being done, and this movie seemed to pretend that any argument can be overcome with flirtation, when there is much more to a romantic partnership than just that.I also did ***not*** appreciate the cooptation of the issue of feminism, where the movie came across as showing it to be a trivial issue that contributes to unnecessary fights within marriage, and feminism should be done away with. I work with women's studies in my career, and if you are going to mention feminism in a film, especially to a wide public audience, get educated about it. Discrimination has a devastating impact on the lives of women worldwide, including domestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, workplace discrimination,... unfortunately I could go on... a lot. I did not like how this film made light of the issue of rape, with a joke that women over 35 are less likely to get raped, ha ha, no big deal; it was awful. If you are going to present a film that incorporates social issues, be responsible with the fact that the information is being heard by large audiences and it should be accurate.",Before Midnight
304,mikefsm,Delightful and beautiful,10,19 July 2013,"I am a huge fan of the series of movies. When I saw the first one, I was captivated by the narration, the plot, the scenes, the sweet innocence of the characters and so I was really satisfied with the movie.With the second part, my faith on the characters was more stronger than ever. Their voices, their stories were like anyone else's and it made feel like I could live that story myself, just like if Judy and Ethan were not actor but real people. It made me feel like if I could be living that exact story, that it can really be real. (unlike those science fiction movies. Needless to say I was with high hopes of watching a third part.Finally that moment came true, and despite the fact it means that this is the end of the story, I am more that enchanted with the third part. The dialogues, the photography, everything is just perfect and every single second of recording fits perfectly the next scene...Thank you so much for making this great movie and feed my soul with this passionate story. Thank you, thank you, thank you.......",Before Midnight
305,kamran_a1,The movie is about how people find real love in modern life.,9,20 July 2013,"Basically, there are two major aspects to this movie. Firstly, in comparison to previous parts, here we see dark side of 'real' love. in Before Sunrise, they experienced perfect love, where there's no struggle, and they were somehow afraid of 'real' love. In Before Sunset, they dare to question 'perfect' love by mentioning the bright sides of 'real' love , and now here in Before Midnight , they come to the point to face the dark side of the real love, but still they like it more than the perfect one. Secondly, I think the whole movie is sort of narrated in a man's perspective which tries to put Celine as the trouble here, which is a bit far from the whole spirit of the sequel. the movie is about people, about talking and knowing each other, its not just love, its about people's past ,present and future, about big issues of modern life which challenge every one of us every day, but we don't spend time to talk about them. I think watching this movie gives us the time.",Before Midnight

The magical story that started with Before sunrise had to have a good concluding scenario. After Before sunset, I kept on wondering that happened next. Before Midnight gave that closure.Overall its a great movie. If you have not watched the first two parts, I highly recommend that you start with Before Sunrise -> Before Sunset & then watch this one.Having said that, I hope they do not make another installment, as the story told till now should suffice.",Before Midnight
307,wcrobertson,Disappointed,7,14 February 2014,"It may have been the movie they wanted to make, and that's their prerogative, but it wasn't entertainment, seeming more like an articulate documentary of two-career couples in anger management therapy.I would rather have seen something where their love is mature and deeper, and it actually helps them transcend the life stresses they featured. I would rather it have been a love story in itself, albeit more richly complicated and tribulated. Too much talk about blow jobs, too, that didn't add to the insight or enjoyment. Seemed gimmicky where it didn't so much when they brought it up in the first two films. I liked the hotel scene filmed with Julie topless. I thought it was bold and effective as a plot device. The dialog range felt a little unnatural because of how hard they tried to say intelligent things in a lot of areas of conversation. It was hard for me to think it was the same person saying all that in the same heated conversation. The Jesse lines did get mean several times that I thought weakened the script. I found the premise of Jesse wanting to move to Chicago to be with his son implausible and almost asinine in their circumstances. Given it was the premise of the argument, and the argument was the film, I didn't find it compelling. I get the continuity 'thing' but it was just another way of featuring a nagging mess.Loved the effort that went into making it, and both actors on screen in many films, but just didn't find this one provocative enough to be entertaining.

It is two disconnected, malcontent, drama queens bickering for endlessly...yes for some this is their reality and they can identify with it. Personally...I'd rather ran a gun down my throat then go through the nonsense portrayed in this film. Two self absorbed adults pretending to put their children first but failing them in every way.

It is tedious and long, and although it accurately portrays how two people may see and talk to each other...it was too the point it made me mad. I could not embrace...like either character, and I wanted to shake the woman for playing the stereotypical over analyzing woman who is never happy.It was not a feel good love story which I thought it might be. It was two people who initially are enjoying each others company, slowly nipping at other at each other through out the day. It was mostly the woman being very insecure about their whole relationship, asking no win questions, Jumping to conclusions, continuing to bring up the same incident in front of friends...until it becomes a full blown fight at the end of the day.In the end they have a very anti-climatic make-up.

312,ta-sha12,Pretentious,2,28 October 2013,"Well, first excuse my writing as English isn't my native tongue. So it's not an indication of how 'educated' or intellectual I am. Second..what Spoiler Alert?? I mean there is no plot to spoil. Which is OK, I Love films with no structure, or the usual storyline. I love Boring films (I enjoyed The Brown Bunny, for example) and I am more into 'artsy' films, long ones, with long takes, etc. But this... is just a bad film that Also happens to be boring and has no point.The dialogs are VERY pretentious. Really? writers get together to talk like that? I think my friends and I had deeper and more meaningful talks in our early 20s.To be honest, I only watched the first 'Before, and that was long time ago. So I wasn't really following the characters and their past. I didn't know Jesse was a writer. When he was discussing his book chapters the beginning of the film, I thought he was talking to some relatives, brother-in-law and his grandpa, or something like that. Like just simple-minded people talking with a hobby writer, dabbling with writing on Sundays. Then the conversation over lunch with the whole group... Really Embarrassing for whoever wrote those lines. Lame and shallow dialogs about sex, modern life, technology. Is this the best they could come up with? ""we always have to make sure it is still there"". Urghh. I think if you talk with a taxi driver, you may get more wisdom than that. And what year is that? 1964? I mean Delpy talking about women failing to achieve anything before 50..? C'Mon. And can she work on her shape a little? My girlfriend who is 40, and a mother of 2 is in great shape, and so are many other women. The film seems to bring together a collection of old clichés and stereotypes + some pretentious lame jokes. Trying too hard to appear witty and smart, which usually fails.The acting: although I hated her character, being bitter and whiny for no good reason, but her acting was fine. But Ethan's acting was just irritating. Like a 40 old something trying to act like a teenager. I was always aware of the fact that this guy is an actor and not a real person. it didn't feel natural. and it didn't feel like a 40 year old man. Also, they didn't sound like a 40 year old couple. The conversation in the car from the airport.. the Apple part.. Made me cringe. That's all I can say. And he is definitely not convincing as a writer. He is too lame and simple-minded to be one. Not a man of words, as the Greek man says. But not only for the way he dresses, but for everything he is.The shallow pretentious conversation made me feel like they were targeting 18-25 year old audience. While the 'issues' or themes they Try to tackle (again: Try) would attract a much older audience. And this is maybe among the main problems with this film. I also think it was the conflict for the actors. Trying to keep the charm of the younger couple we saw in the first Before. But they are too old for that, and are supposed to be much more mature.I tried to see One positive aspect of her personality. Couldn't find any. She is very bitter, negative, unhappy, whining not appreciative of him, and you just wonder if she really loves him. Also, why is he still with her? He doesn't seem to appreciate her, and even points it out: No one would put up with her sht for more than a few months- except him. He loves her..but it seems like a love that lacks passion..and reason. Love as a habit. it seems more like an old-fashioned kind of marriage. She is the mother of my kids, we have been married for years, so of course I love her. I may look around and desire other women..but at the end of the day, she is my wife and we will get old together.",Before Midnight

Ever.,1,9 November 2013,"It appears that Linklater was elated to merely have Ethan Hawke, that awful blonde actress, and a beautiful setting, but nothing more. I swear they made up the script as they were shooting. Credits support this notion because the three above are credited with the writing. I suppose it is somewhat impressive that these actors could do L - O - N - G scenes without a single cut, but So. Damned. Boring. I mean when the camera finally does cut to something like a goat, you find yourself thinking - oh my God! There's a freaking goat! Yeaaaay!!! On top of the self indulgent film making, one has to endure 90 minutes of a bunch of Godless miserable atheists being totally selfish, feeling sorry for their poor miserable selves. At one point I was wondering if anything even remotely interesting would ever happen in the god-awful P.O.S., and I fantasized that if Al Pacino suddenly showed up with a Thompson sub-machine gun and cut these two whining morons in half - that would make me happy!

There is NO WAY this movie has been so well received, No way!!! What? Is their some sort of politics behind this that I'm unaware of? Refuse to believe that people have jumped on the bandwagon... willingly. Has me wondering what the agenda is (and trust me, this movie is so bad- there must be an agenda.)Chemistry? What Chemistry? It was embarrassing to watch their feigned chemistry, really really embarrassed for them. Forced Dialogue. Forced Chemistry. And a conversation that just went on and on. A few sparks and wit could have (and should have) gone a long way. Julie Delpy has always been a charming actress, unfortunately her charm is non-existent in this latest work. Ethan Hawke, instead of embracing his years' is seemingly trying too hard to be ""that guy"" that stole the hearts of viewers' in Before Sunrise. The only enjoyable aspect is the breathtaking backdrop of Greek Peninsula.... but even the scenery is not worth enduring the pain of this so called film.For all you viewers who kept fast-forwarding or just plain gave up after 15-30 minutes, completely understandable.

If this is what a modern couple's relationship is supposed to be, then I think we can all give up. Jesse seems to do anything to appease the disagreeable Celine.

God bless men who settle for crazy and believes it is normal. Wished i didn't have to give it a star to post. It doesn't even deserve one! Male character role seemed to care and attempt to make the relationship better. Hey, but you know what, in our society, everything can be disposed of... Even love. Love and commitment should be worth fighting for, not thrown away because of selfish desires. With a movie like this, how can we expect the world to be a better place if we teach them love ends... When we have true love, it NEVER FAILS. What a disappointment. I just can not believe I wasted my time watching a movie I found under the romance genre that was highly rated where the couple fights the entire 1 1/2 hours and most of that time, the woman is arguing while topless... Is that to distract the audience from the miserableness of the movie? That was uncalled for. The icing on the cake? Living as a married couple, but were not even considering marriage!

I enjoyed the first in the series the most, and the second could watch with some enjoyment, but this one I really literally couldn't stand watching for over 30 minutes. This movie is an oxymoron...aimed at over 30's but written like a 18 year old 40 years old. Simply makes no sense.

The only breaks from this are the opening few minutes where the husband talks to his son and later when the group of friends talk over dinner. There is some nice scenery and some great shots of a charming Greek town but that is just not enough to make it a movie. Good movies are a bit like life with all the boring parts cut out. This is a bit like life except with the boring parts left in and people talking about the interesting parts. Good movies tell an interesting story by showing the action. This just shows people talking about what could be an interesting story.Before Midnight is a lot like hanging out with someone's parents for an hour and a half and getting too much information - way too much.

This movie in particular is the most realistic extension of the story built up by its two prequels; it doesn't contains minimal amount (if not none) of the cliché idea of love being everlasting, exciting, amazing, etc. that many of us today foolishly believe in. This movie portrays the real, hard realities of relationships in ways almost every decade-or-two old couple will be able to relate to with themselves. There are scenes that will send electricity running down your spine when a sudden mature realization of reality hits you, almost as if you're experiencing enlightenment. On the acting front, both Hawke and Delpy have done full justice to their roles; I was surprised how they were able to pull off long undivided scenes given the huge length of dialogues between them in those scenes.

Certainly nothing to be ashamed of, look at us, we're refreshingly post-modern so I will go out of my way repeatedly to portray this point either directly or by clear undertones'. With an annoyingly relentless agenda, people unknowingly make sex such a huge deal. The humour in this regard was also rather predictable. The overall flow of conversation by the characters in the movie though, was witty.
