0,TheLittleSongbird,"Doesn't kick ass anywhere near as much as the first film, but a watchable sequel",5,16 August 2014,"The first film was incredibly entertaining and a huge breath of fresh air. This sequel is not as bad as all that and there are far worse sequels about, in fact it is quite watchable, but compared to its predecessor it does fall well short. It's still slickly edited, the colours dazzle with no garishness or drabness, the costumes are still a lot of fun and the effects are incredible. The shaky cam while effective in some scenes was too much in others though. The music is breezy, adrenaline-pumping and catchy, if not quite as fitting as the soundtrack in the first. The witty, edgy humour and the (even more) violent, tense action sequences still remain and with little diminished impact, the climax is incredibly exciting. Admittedly some of it does get violent to the point of being too much to stomach for some, it wasn't a problem with me but parts could have toned down a tad. The dialogue is not as fresh as the first's but still quite witty and irreverent. It is the story where Kick Ass 2 falls down on most, it is lacking in the lively pace of the original, due to some overlong and draggy scenes, and there are a lot of tone shifts that are rather abrupt and awkwardly done, there is a bit of trying to do too much quality. The high school/trying to fit in subplot always is a nice idea but again very little fresh or interesting is done with it, it does drag the pace down with the most uninteresting scenes being to do with this particular subplot and it does feel out of sorts with the rest of the film. Of course there are enough fun, exciting and at times emotional moments but not enough to hide how problematic the story is. The supporting characters are colourful enough especially the main antagonist, Mother Russia and Colonel Stars and Stripes but the leads feel underdeveloped and not always easy to root for, certainly nowhere near as colourful, if anything while well played their personalities are bland. The acting is good enough, although John Leguizamo is very much wasted and Christopher Mintz-Plasse while fine as Chris over-compensates a little as the villain(I would say his name but the guidelines have a thing about prohibited words). Chloe Grace Moretz carried the film brilliantly though and Aaron Johnson is just as confident. Jim Carrey is also wonderfully refreshing and a more than pleasing presence. Overall, a watchable sequel but the first Kick Ass kicks ass much, much better. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Kick-Ass 2
1,Leofwine_draca,"Some worthy ideas, but not as good as the first",6,11 June 2014,"KICK-ASS 2 is the inevitable follow-up to the surprise comic book hit, which mixed broad comedy with hard action to provide one of the freshest superhero movies in years. This sequel is more predictable, following a familiar action-movie template while mixing in some terrible humour along the way.The tone of the film is uneven with a mix of genuinely good, well-choreographed action moments with cheesy interludes that wouldn't be amiss in a Z-grade movie. For instance, the final warehouse fight is large scale, hard-hitting and great fun, but the awful green-screen effects on that van fight really take you out of it. Some of the new supporting characters are pretty interesting, particularly the unstoppable Mother Russia, and John Leguizamo bags a very funny supporting role.Unfortunately, Wadlow is a better director than he is a scriptwriter and he has little idea what to do with his leading characters. Taylor-Johnson is given little to do and feels like an extra in his own movie, while the whole sub-plot with Chloe Grace Moretz going to high school is just stupid, juvenile and needless. The humour is also more uneven this time around, reaching a real low with the ridiculous vomit and diarrhoea scenes.As ever, KICK-ASS 2 gets by for the wealth of action alone, and the willingness to go one step further than most PG-13 rated Hollywood superhero flicks. Jim Carrey is the film's real ace, bagging the best role as Colonel Stars and Stripes. Carrey is unrecognisable throughout and his own brand of relentless energy marks a real high point. In reality, KICK-ASS 2 is a pretty superficial and unnecessary sequel, but fans of the first film are sure to enjoy it anyway.",Kick-Ass 2
2,SnoopyStyle,bigger team not necessarily better,6,1 August 2014,"Mindy Macready (Chloë Grace Moretz) promises her new guardian Detective Marcus Williams (Morris Chestnut) that she won't be Hit-Girl anymore. She tries to fit in but falls out with mean girl Brooke (Claudia Lee). Dave Lizewski (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) as Kick-Ass joins up with Dr. Gravity (Donald Faison), Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey), Night Bitch (Lindy Booth), and others to battle street crime. He can't convince Hit-Girl to join. Chris D'Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) wants to avenge his father's death and kill Kick-Ass. He becomes The-MotherFcker and hires a gang of supervillains.This depends on what you thought about this franchise. The movie tries to up the carnage. It tries to be some sort of Dark Knight lite. But it also tries to be a high school drama with Hit-Girl faced with Mean Girls. The whole things leaves the movie underwhelmed and a little bit scattered in tone. Hit-Girl's story is somewhat interesting but it's not supported by the other characters. Lyndsy Fonseca returns just to break up with Dave. She's prime to be there for the high school drama but she disappears. She could have been one of the new superhero. There is a whole new gang of superheroes. Jim Carrey is taking the place of Nicolas Cage. The other problem is that the three main characters are scattered into their own separate stories. It keeps straining to make some connection between them. Lastly, both Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Chloë Grace Moretz are getting too old to play high school kids.",Kick-Ass 2
3,Horst_In_Translation,Nerdvengers carried by Hit-Girl (and hurt by too little of her),6,19 June 2015,"""Kick-Ass 2"" is a movie from two years ago and was made three years after the first installment about a pretty unconventional superhero. The cast is similar to the first film. Nicholas Cage is obviously out, but Jim Carrey is in for him. Even the main antagonist is played by the same actor as in film number 1, even if it is a different villain this time. However, there was a crucial change behind the camera. Matthew Vaughn is out and the writer and director here is Jeff Wadlow. I wonder why though. Wadlow's works before this film were neither particularly well-known nor really well-received by the critics. And this shows here. Sadly, his approach to the world of Kick-Ass leaves me a bit disappointed.The real strength of the first movie was that it was 100% fun, a great parody of other superhero films, but never took itself seriously at all. Just goofy fun. This description does not apply to this film. It does take itself seriously and tries to be dramatically relevant occasionally and that hurt the film more than it helped, for example with the death of Kick-Ass' dad and the morale that comes with it, the parallel to Hit-Girl's past. It also would have helped if the protagonist hadn't been trained and muscular like a real superhero at times, but looked a bit more like we do. The first film profited a lot from us being able to identify with the hero and that aspect is totally lost here. Also, it became painfully clear that the character of Kick-Ass is not really interesting enough to watch to carry this franchise. Moretz' character turned into normal high school life for over two thirds of this 100-minute movie and she was dearly missed. When she returns near the end, it is a delight though. The moment she appears on the roof of that truck was pretty epic and from there on the film is better again. Jim Carrey is supposed to elevate the movie when Hit Girl wasn't there, but it's not really working. I love the man, but he has a bit of a nothing character here who was not written half as interesting enough as I would have liked. And then there is also the strange development of Kick-Ass' love life. His girlfriend from the first film leaves him right away early in this one, so he is dating a fellow superhero girl for most of the film. Sadly, there is no elaboration on her at all. Who is she? How did they meet? What is their relationship like? And when we maybe finally get used to them being a couple, there is a kissing scene with Hit-Girl and Kick-Ass near the end that really questions it all again. In connection to that, I also want to say that the scene where she sees him topless and is obviously attracted to him was pretty strange. It somehow reminded me of Jacob's topless scenes in ""Twilight"" and I really could have done without it.If they decide to make a third movie (not sure about that, the ending sounded a bit final and it was not as successful from a business perspective as the first film), it really needs more Hit-Girl than this one, because Kick-Ass alone just isn't enough. There was nothing memorable about him at all in here and to be honest, I'd prefer a new movie without Kick-Ass and only with Hit-Girl, maybe a prequel if they get Cage on board again. Moretz is clearly the MVP in this franchise and she also has a much better story in this film here, much more character development than the actual hero. Speaking about the antagonist, Christopher Mintz-Plasse made a decent villain in here and brought a good mix of ruthlessness and goofiness to the role. I don't know if the scene with his erection problems was really good, but it was certainly among the most memorable moments from this movie. And even if we think he was dead at first, one scene during the credits shows us that he may be back for another installment as the main villain. But still we don't even know if there will be another film. It could be that the casting of Aaron Taylor-Johnson backfires. I see no star potential in him at all and it's basically all the supporting players who make this franchise worth a watch. Mother Russia was an interesting addition too. Her character somehow fit nicely in the film I thought.This movie is certainly not as good as the first. It tries to stick to known formulas, like social media references throughout the entire film, almost too many for my taste, but all in all it just comes short. It also could have needed some more famous songs if you ask me, especially in the crucial scenes, for example when Moretz' character destroys the reputation of her female fellow students with a most peculiar instrument. Still, it is not a bad film by any means and worth a watch if you enjoyed the first.",Kick-Ass 2
4,Prismark10,More ass kicking,5,7 February 2014,"Chloë Grace Moretz is back as Hit Girl in Kick Ass 2 which found an audience amongst teenage boys and girls. Dave Lizewski (Aaron Taylor- Johnson) teams up with her and trains to become a proper Kick Ass whilst both of them try to outfox Hit Girl's guardian.However the film-makers forgot about the target audience whilst Hit Girl is trying to comes to terms with her identity outside her Hit Girl persona as a teenage girl at school, with the mix of school and adolescent politics and peer pressure. The film mixes such teenage issues with crude sex, bad language although the violence is appropriately cartoonish.Christopher Mintz-Plasse is back out to avenge his gangster father's death. He calls himself The ""Motherf***er and assembles a crew of super villains with Mother Russia being the one who is the baddest ass of them all. However Motherf***er is just a lightweight and Kick Ass has become stronger.Jim Carrey replaces Nicholas Cage as the father figure type. He is Colonel Stars and Stripes who assembles a Justice Forever team of heroes. Carrey very much plays it straight although it might have been better if it was hinted that he might just be playing for the dark side to add some doubts to his character.As with the first film, the tone and mix of violence, bad language and use of sex is uneven but this time even more so. It is probably why the film disappointed at the box office.It also looks cheap with some British cast, UK location filming and interior filming trying to disguise its low budget. The biggest problem is that the film is less fun and subversive than the original. Kick Ass the character is less interesting from the first film and his friends seem to display more charisma.",Kick-Ass 2
5,nogodnomasters,THIS IS HOW THE BEER GETS DELIVERED,6,30 July 2018,"This film picks up a few years later. Kick-Ass (Aaron Taylor-Johnson )joins a Justice League of misfit crime fighters. Hit-Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) has promised to stop crime fighting as she stuffs dollar bills into the swear jar. Our bad guy (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) has taken on a name not worth repeating. He has started his own league of criminals.The film is let down. Kick-Ass has taken on the looks and persona of Harold Ramis. The film is filled with awkward swearing, i.e. lines read by people who don't know how to swear. The Justice League of misfits should have been a solid spoof, but instead was written rather lame.The film had potential. It opened with a re-do of my favorite scene from the first film, but since I have seen that film, the element of surprise was missing, making the scene a bust. Hit Girl as Mindy suffers from teen angst as she fails to fit in with the kids in high school.The plot was bad, characters were shallow, and the humor was a yawn. Yet there are aspects of enjoyment to be found in the film.This is aimed at the young adult audience who have to lie about their age to see it.Parental Guide: F-bombs, nudity.",Kick-Ass 2
6,kosmasp,Taking Names,7,19 May 2014,"One of them being Jim Carey, who kinda distanced himself before the movie got released. Buzz like that can affect ones view of a movie. I don't think it was a marketing stunt, because there was an incident before the movie got released, where someone died pretending to be the main character of this movie.Trying to exclude all that (and you should, because after all this is just a movie and should not treated as anything else), the movie is pretty violent and it might have issues with trying to keep the balance between being mean (and violent) and funny. I haven't read the comic this is based on, but everyone is adamant that it is worse than the movie itself. Worse in the sense that it's more violence more un-political correct. Yes it's possible.The acting overall is good and for a sequel it is really nice. The main villain (a ""leftover"" from part 1) is at times good, but mostly does not work ... especially because the perception of the actor playing him does not help most people see through to his character. Which is why the end is ... well not satisfying.",Kick-Ass 2
7,jboothmillard,Kick-Ass 2,8,20 September 2013,"The first film I remember being good fun, I was hoping to see it again to remind myself of it, and I will be honest and say that I was mixed about whether I wanted to see this sequel or not, but I'm glad I did, from director Jeff Wadlow (Cry_Wolf). Basically, following the events of the previous, the bravery of Dave Lizewski, known to America as masked superhero Kick-Ass (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), has created a trend of other citizens turned masked superheroes, and he returns teamed with Mindy Macready aka Hit-Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz). Chris D'Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) has ditched his former Red Mist costume, and still wanting to avenge his father's death and cause destruction to the city he becomes super villain The Motherf***er and recruits a number of criminals with the help of his assistant Javier (John Leguizamo). Hit-Girl getting herself in danger is eventually banned from going out and getting in danger by her guardian, Detective Marcus Williams (Morris Chestnut), but it does not stop her sneaking out, and she also has to contend with girls in her high school being mean to her, unaware of her fighting skills. With no fighting partner Dave joins a team of heroes called ""Justice Forever,"" where various masked and costumed heroes from the city can gather together and fight crime, they are led by Sal Bertolinni aka Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey). Other members of Justice Forever include Miranda Swedlow aka Night Bitch (Lindy Booth), Dr. Gravity (Donald Faison), Insect Man (Robert Emms), a gay hero (Road Trip's Andy Dick), parents of a missing boy named Tommy (Steven Mackintosh and Monica Dolan), and Battle Guy, who is actually Dave's friend Marty (Clark Duke), they start small but eventually patrol the streets and gain respect. The Motherf***er meanwhile has completed his evil league, including Mother Russia (Olga Kurkulina), Black Death (Daniel Kaluuya), The Tumor (Dead Set's Andy Nyman) and Genghis Carnage (Tom Wu), and he is ready to cause destruction, while Dave has to deal with his identity being found out, and his father Mr. Lizewski (Garrett M. Brown) being arrested on his behalf. It is the gang of criminals kill Colonel Stars and Stripes that the Justice Forever team get back together and are ready to defeat the ultimate evil to the city, and a big fight ensues in the villain lair, after the raucous Kick-Ass tries to save The Motherf***er at one point, but he falls to have a poignant death, he ends up mauled by a shark. Justice Forever disband forever and all the heroes take off their masks, Mindy takes Dave home but is not staying and rides her motorcycle out of New York, this is to protect Marcus as well, he accepts that he is the hero that the city needs, and he trains and improves himself to become a better Kick-Ass. Also starring Augustus Prewas as Todd aka Ass Kicker, Lyndsy Fonseca as Katie Deauxma, Yancy Butler as Angie D'Amico and Iain Glen as Uncle Ralph. Moretz remains just as foul-mouthed and kicking butt as before, Taylor- Johnson has become more confident and is still likable, Carrey is a welcome new addition as the leader of the superhero get together group, and Mintz-Plasse gets much more screen time being a really try-hard bad guy, many of the supporting stars create memorable characters as well, whether good or evil. I agree the ""there's a hero in all of us"" concept is a little cheesy, and some of the controversy seen previously is slightly lessened, but the acting is good, the script is slick, the laughs seem much more slapstick and lovingly ridiculous, the funniest bit may be shocking girls and make them vomiting and and spew feces, and of course the fight sequences are exciting to watch, especially the last twenty minutes, it for me was a better than the original action comedy drama. Very good!",Kick-Ass 2
8,Tweekums,Not bad but nowhere near as much fun as the first film,7,22 November 2014,"A few years have passed since the first film and Dave thinks it is time to get out his Kick-Ass costume and team up with Hit-Girl. After some training he goes up against some street punks but has to be saved by Hit-Girl. She deals with them but the police report leads her guardian, policeman Marcus Williams to discover what she is doing. He make her promise to stop going out and fighting crime so for most of the film she puts away the purple costume and is just Mindy Macready; a girl trying to make friends in high school. Without Hit-Girl Dave tries to find another group of heroes and ends up finding a group; they want to do good but they aren't as tough as Hit-Girl and Big-Daddy were. Meanwhile Chris D'Amico, formerly known as 'Red Mist' decides to become a super villain and get his revenge on Kick-Ass for killing his father with a bazooka. He assembles a gang of psychopaths and sets about getting his revenge; first targeting those close to Kick-Ass then going after him if Hit-Girl doesn't come out of retirement he is doomed.I really enjoyed the first film but felt this one was less enjoyable that isn't to say I didn't find plenty to laugh at and generally enjoy it; it just lacked a certain something. It starts well but as soon as Hit-Girl hangs up her purple wig and tries to become an ordinary high school girl we get an unnecessary subplot which makes Mindy come across as a weaker character and the denouement where she hits the antagonists with 'puke sticks' was far too cartoony and nothing like we'd have expected from the pint-sized psychopathic super-hero of the first film. Chris D'Amico's super-villain comes across as a wannabe; nowhere near as tough or as cool as his father. The new group of heroes is entertaining enough; especially its leader; Colonel Stars and Stripes Jim Carrey did a fine job in the roll; playing it straight without his traditional gurning for the camera. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Chloë Grace Moretz continue to do well as Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl although the latter is less shocking this time as she is nor mid-teens rather than eleven. As before there is plenty of swearing and violence although if you are bothered by that I expect you'd have given up on Kick-Ass after the first film. Overall I found this better than reviews had suggested and thought it was fun enough without getting near to being as good as the first film.",Kick-Ass 2
9,BA_Harrison,Don't be offended be entertained.,8,20 August 2015,"Where Kick-Ass grounded itself in reality to give its violence more impact, its sequel opts for a totally implausible premise and far more OTT action scenes, with its titular character now a bona fide bad-ass; where the first film offered genuine wit and pathos, the second goes for vulgar humour and several scenes that are in extremely dubious taste (puke and poop gags aren't for everyone; there are even fewer people who can see the funny side of a rape joke). In taking this approach, Kick-Ass 2 seems to have upset many, if not most fans of the original film.But while I admit that this second outing for the home-made superhero isn't quite as satisfying overall as the character's hugely successful debut, those who aren't easily offended should still find enough to enjoy about this crazy movie to make it worth a go. There is plenty of graphic bloodletting, Jim Carrey puts in a brief but memorable appearance as heroic Colonel Stars and Stripes, there are plenty of well staged moments of chaos and destruction (as ridiculous as it is, Hit Girl's bullet riddled scene on top of a speeding van is utterly exhilarating), and Christopher Mintz-Plasse is a riot, dressed from head to toe in PVC as arch super-villain The Motherf**ker.Yes, Kick-Ass 2 has little finesse. Yes, the 'being true to oneself' plot is far from original; and yes, in places, the film does go a little too far in order to get laughs. But for a huge helping of glorious, unrestrained, over-indulgent nonsense loaded with lots of swearing and gratuitous, mean-spirited violence, one could do a whole lot worse.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for Chloë Grace Moretz: she might have precious little screen time as Hit Girl, but she still owns every scene she is in.",Kick-Ass 2
10,paul_haakonsen,"Not as great as the first movie, but still good entertainment...",7,31 August 2013,"I don't get the hype about Jim Carrey being in the movie, and I must admit that it wasn't even a factor to determine my choice to go watch ""Kick Ass 2"".This sequel is good entertainment, lots of action and good humor, but it is not up to par with the first movie. There is just something missing to make it as fun and interesting as the first movie.Indeed, you have a lot more of these ordinary, average-day people turned 'superheroes' in ""Kick Ass 2"", and the costumes are fun and interesting to look at - lots of great ideas.And while we are on the 'superhero' topic, then as for the villains go, then it was only ""The Motherf#cker"", ""Mother Russia"" and ""The Tumor"" that were given any real screen time and playing parts in the movie. The other villains that were in the inner circle were just mostly standing idly by, fillers on the screen at best.The movie does have potential, but it just doesn't utilize all that has been stretched out before it, ready for the picking. As such, then the movie does come off sort of hollow in terms of character development and depth.There is a good ensemble of actors and actresses on the cast list, and people did good jobs with their given roles and 'superhero' characters.If you enjoyed the first ""Kick Ass"" movie, by all means watch ""Kick Ass 2"", because it is lots of fun and full of action and fighting. However, don't expect it to excel in any way compared to the first movie.",Kick-Ass 2
11,sunwarrior13,A Movie About Idealism,9,18 August 2013,"Kick-Ass 2 is a superhero action comedy film based on the comic book of the same title and Hit-Girl and is the sequel to Kick-Ass.It stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson,Christopher Mintz-Plasse,Chloë Grace Moretz and Jim Carrey.Jeff Wadlow wrote the screenplay and directed the film.The film picks up sometime after the events of the first film. Dave Lizewski and Mindy Macready are trying to re-acclimate to normal life as high school teenagers, instead of prowling the streets as Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl, respectively. However, old habits die hard and Dave soon finds himself under Mindy's tutelage, as their circle of would-be vigilantes expands into a legitimate team, led by the wily Colonel Stars and Stripes.But every light has its shadow and Kick-Ass' newfound place in a league of good people inspires his former adversary Chris D'Amico to become the world's first true supervillain. Chris eventually gathers demented psychopaths like Mother Russia and Genghis Carnage as his enforcers.They set out to avenge Chris' slain father by destroying everything in Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl's worlds.Kick-Ass 2 is a sequel to Vaughn's surprisingly smart, stylish and witty first film. But beyond that, all you're getting is a standard action film for its audience are treated to some over-the-top, bloody and gross violence action scenes. But it is performed in such a pleasing, comic- book manner that you can't be repulsed nor offended.If it wasn't Kick- Ass or Hit-Girl headlining, there would likely be little excitement and even less payoff from it.Its biggest asset is its idealism. The sincerity of its heroes is embraced and admired and there is no trace of cynicism. Also,it deals with the loss, pain and consequences of taking action while others sit on the sidelines.Its moral is simple: the personal cost of morality and bravery is dear. Loved ones may be lost, but that loss only makes the just more determined to fight harder.",Kick-Ass 2
12,Theo Robertson,Instantly Forgotten,6,17 April 2015,"The original KICK-ASS was a deconstructionist black comedy that revolved around mortals wanting to become superheroes and was a relatively big hit . Now let's be honest here and confess much of the marketing had a cynical edge where an eleven year old girl goes around slicing and dicing bad guys . Cue lots of outrage from moral guardians that this marks the end of Western civilization as we know it while anyone with the slightest bit of curiosity would queue up at the cinema to see what the fuss was about , Cynical indeed but at least the original was a good film of sorts mainly thanks to director Matthew Vaughn whose work I've always enjoyed and doesn't make enough films for my liking This sequel sees Vaughn as producer and is replaced in the director seat by Jeff Wadlow . KICK-ASS 2 has the same look and feel as the 2010 movie and yet there's something missing which I can't put my finger on . One thing that isn't missing is the cynicism of having a bunch of teenage geeks swearing , make sexual references and get involved in acts of comic book violence . Your parents won't approve of this boys and girls but it's not necessarily a reason to go and rush out to see it I've written this review immediately after seeing KICK-ASS 2 and yet I can hardly remember a thing about it . I recall enjoying it at the time flaws and all and now that the credits have finished there's nothing that stuck out in my memory which might tell you something",Kick-Ass 2
13,Scarecrow-88,Kick-Ass 2,5,7 September 2014,"Chloë Grace Moretz is still the superstar of Kick-Ass, even though the movie is named after the superhero character played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Taylor-Johnson is endearing even as his highschooler in the green-and-yellow costume pummels the bad guys, now aligned with a group of wannabe superheroes, led by an ex-mob enforcer (turned born-again Christian annihilator) named Captain Stars and Stripes (played by a demented looking Jim Carrey, in fatigues, with yellow teeth, military hair cut, and gruff beard) called Justice Forever. Moretz, on the other hand, promises her dad's partner (and adoptive father) that she'll quit being Hit-Girl. So she gets involved with Mean Girls in school, ultimately embarrassed and ridiculed by them not long after they indicate she belongs with them. The ""sick stick"" incident is one of the best scenes, particularly how the head cheerleader bitch both vomits and diarrheas on the lunchroom floor. Christopher Mintz-Plasse hyper-actively provides his vengeance-seeking Chris D'Amico with plenty of asshole and wimpy rich-kid obnoxiousness. With money, self-absorbed D'Amico buys ""supervillains"" (Mother Russia, in particular, obliterates everyone, including 10 police officers!) that will do anything he wants to prove how evil he is. The sheer hilarity in that Chris' costume derives from his mother's S&M gear ought to tell you just how raunchy this film can be. Kick-Ass 2 is awfully violent, as a word of warning, even as a comic book action flick. With kids doing most of the violence, this could be kind of uncomfortable. Even I found the fight between Hit-Girl and Mother Russia a bit hard to watch due to how it often looked one-sided. A fifteen-year-old being thrown around by this 'roid Freak that seems impervious to pain and brutalizes people far older than her could be critically held questionable. Dismissed as action fare that shouldn't be viewed harshly because of its comic book nature, even I was wondering if this film went too far. I just want to say this, though: Lindy Booth is a smokin' ginger as Night Bitch, but her treatment by Chris proves just how contemptible he is. Christ gets what's coming to him even if he's a cretin due to his parental upbringing. The shark tank and supervillain lair ultimately mock how ludicrous Chris turns out to be as this evil leader of very bad people in costume. My favorite scene involves Hit-Girl (not in costume) unloading on a group of Chris' goons who kidnap Taylor-Johnson's Dave while trying to keep from falling off the van (this includes her climbing up one of the goons who is hanging from the open passenger side door!)it is totally ridiculous, but it beats seeing her taking a pounding from a female wrestler twice her size. The ""adrenaline shot"" where Hit-Girl is on the same level as Mother Russia sums up pretty much how taking this seriously could be unwise. Morris Chestnut as a snuggly father type seems like miscasting but oddly ingratiates as Moretz is susceptible to his desire to see her happily without danger threatening her young life. The ending leads us to believe that there won't be a third film and I think that's for the best. However, there's plenty of blood-letting and outbursts of graphic body assaults are common, so those desiring that will have their bloodthirst satiated.",Kick-Ass 2
14,Bunuel1976,"KICK-ASS 2 (Jeff Wadlow, 2013) **1/2",6,27 September 2013,"The original KICK-ASS (2010) had divided critics: I recall the late Roger Ebert deeming it offensive and awarding the film a measly *; this reprise seems to have gone one further in that objections were raised even by those who loved its predecessor! As for myself, I found it generally a fun ride – if obviously lacking in freshness: one thing the first movie had going for it was the shock factor, which never elicits the same response in a sequel anyway (and this, regrettably, does seem to up the ante on the nastiness!).Once again, Chloe Grace Moretz as Mindy Macready/Hit-Girl comes off best: she is fast becoming the Jodie Foster of her generation (with a comparable penchant/knack for playing beyond her years); with this in mind, I am not very enthusiastic about her upcoming reboot (ironically, there is a jibe at this lazy current trend in the film under review!) of CARRIEeven if she did undeniably score in another remake, LET ME IN (2010)! Indeed, despite the title, Aaron Taylor-Johnson pretty much takes a back-seat to her character development here, and to that of Christopher Mintz-Plasse's outrageous reinvention from ""Red Mist"" to ""The Motherf***er"" (though one never for a second buys him as a supervillain!). An attempt to create a relationship between Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass and his ageing, unwise father emerges as not only weak but serves merely as a plot device to trigger the inevitable all-out showdown between the two costumed factions! This also continues the tradition of the series in having a star act as a mentor to one of the protagonists and who eventually meets a horrible death at the hands of the bad guys. Jim Carrey (following in the footsteps of Nicolas Cage) subsequently, rather bafflingly, disowned the movie's glorification of violence – though I would say it is more of an ode to vigilantism. That said, the ""Justice Forever"" troupe is too anodyne to make much of a ripple in the public consciousness! Hit-Girl, too, gets another severe trashing before the character's nemesis receives her just desserts in crowd-pleasingly over-the-top fashion. With respect to the female lead, while I did not mind the high-school antagonism scenes (even if the ""Sick Stick"" joke went too far and was completely unwarranted!), her being constantly grounded by the cop protector eventually got tiresome (still, this does lead to a nice paraphrasing of that famous JAWS {1975} quote about ""need{ing} a bigger boat"", which film also worms its way into the climax)! The brief post-credits sequence hints at a possible future entry in the saga; I think the film-makers should learn when to leave well enough alone (especially since Moretz will presumably have outgrown the part by that time)! I do not know how the film ended in the lap of, to me unknown, writer/director Wadlow – but I failed to see his individual vision amid the necessary (read: obligatory) adherence to a successful formulawhich is perhaps why the services of the original's helmer, Matthew Vaughn, were retained in a producing capacity!",Kick-Ass 2
15,zardoz-13,"""Kick Ass 2"" Whips It!",9,26 August 2013,"Costume-clad crime fighters patrol the streets once again in the sequel to director Matthew Vaughn's ""Kick Ass"" (2010), with Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Chloë Grace Moretz reprising their roles as Kick Ass and Hit-Girl. Jim Carrey, who looks nothing like himself, replaces Nicolas Cage as the grown-up superhero mentor. No, he doesn't play the Big Daddy character that Cage incarnated. Instead, Carrey plays a goon named Captain Stars and Stripes, a born-again Christian who made his living as a mafia enforcer. Happily, ""Cry Wolf"" writer and director Jeff Wadlow sticks with Vaughn's surefire formula and serves up a sufficient number of hyperkinetic, gravity-defying, acrobatic combat sequences. Wadlow choreographs these clashes in ""Kick Ass 2"" in such an aesthetically pleasing manner that the carnage doesn't seem as horrific as in the original. Mind you, this outlandish but energetic, 103-minute, R-rated, melodrama features profane language galore and an array of mean-spirited characters that you won't soon forget. Comparably, the original ""Kick Ass"" relied far more on more blood and gore than its' virtually immaculate sequel. The massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary school may have accounted for toned-down content of ""Kick Ass 2."" Can anybody forget that microwave scene at the home construction store where the mobster exploded like a raspberry Danish? Nevertheless, neither ""Kick Ass"" movie boasted the kind of blood, gore, and mayhem that Mark Millar depicted in his outrageous graphic novels. The premise that an 11-year old adolescent female could wield a variety of lethal weapons with such a devastating expertise made ""Kick Ass"" audacious in its own right. The sequel takes the violence to another level and carries on the saga in the aftermath of Big Daddy's demise. Although he doesn't appear in ""Kick Ass 2,"" Nicolas Cage makes a cameo in the form of pictures of his dorky character. The villains are appropriately despicable, and one—Mother Russia—could pass for Dolph Lundgren's illegitimate daughter.In ""Kick Ass,"" high school student Dave Lizewski (Aaron Taylor-Johnson of ""Savages"") wondered why nobody ever slipped into a superhero costume and waged a war against crime. Poor Dave learned the hard way that life was not a comic book. Ruffians shellacked him so righteously that Dave's physicians had to perform some minor ""Wolverine"" like alterations to his body. Nevertheless, despite his metal plates and damaged nerve endings, Dave still felt the pain and agony of repeated whippings. Eventually, Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and Hit Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz of ""Hugo"") intervened and teamed up with Dave. A former NYPD detective, Big Daddy was determined to exact vengeance on crime boss Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) for framing him as a drug dealer and sending him to prison for five years. Meantime, Dave wasn't the only person who thought it would be cool to impersonate a superhero. Frank's dimwit son Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse of ""Superbad"") wanted to learn the ropes of his father's business. Frank refused to let him into the mob until Big Daddy launched his campaign against his organization. Chris dressed up like a goofy superhero, dubbed himself 'Red Mist,' and careened around in a scarlet sports cars puffing on pot to take the edge off. Chris used Dave as a patsy to reach Big Daddy. As Red Mist, he managed to shoot Hit Girl and capture Big Daddy for Frank. Frank's henchmen incinerated Big Daddy in front of an Internet audience. Hit Girl swore revenge with Dave. She wiped out most of Frank's mob while Dave blew up the crime chieftain with a bazooka, leaving Chris behind ranting for his own retribution. At this point, Dave realized the real world was no place for comic book heroics.As ""Kick Ass 2"" unfolds, Dave basks in the admiration of his fellow New Yorkers who have picked up his mantle and prowl the streets. Hit Girl has hung up her outfit and stashed her arsenal after her guardian, NYPD Detective Marcus Williams (Morris Chestnut of ""The Call""), insisted she had no business thwarting crime. Now, Hit Girl is just Mindy Macready. She is experiencing life in high school. She runs afoul of a clique like those in ""Mean Girls,"" but proves she can hold her own against these dames. At one point, Mindy resorts to the 'sick stick' to bring down three divas who try to trash her reputation. Once the 'sick stick' touches an individual that person involuntarily blows chunks out of both ends. This scene qualifies as the funniest in this otherwise hardcore actioneer. Reluctantly, largely because he is bored, Dave dons his emerald green outfit to wade back into his war against crime. He learns about Captain Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey of ""Ace Ventura"") who has mobilized his own Justice Forever vigilante group. Meantime, Chris hasn't forgotten about Kick Ass and Hit Girl. He wants to kill them, but his mother ( Yancy Butler of TV's ""Witchblade"") stands in his way. Predictably, Chris disposes of her and then creates a new identity. In ""Kick Ass,"" Chris sought to be a superhero. In ""Kick Ass 2,"" however, he prefers to be a super villain! He christens himself as 'The Motherf**ker' and assembles a squad of sadists, with Mother Russia (newcomer Olga Kurkulina), who models a red bikini with the traditional style Communist hammer and sickle. Wait until you see what this wench can do!The original ""Kick Ass"" constituted a handbook for child abuse. Big Daddy taught his 11-year old daughter how to handle weapons of every description until she was proficient in their usage. At one point, he strapped her into a bulletproof vest so he could prepare her for the sensation of being struck by a bullet. The sight of a young girl—imagine a female version of Daniel in the lion's den—decimating drug dealers and street thugs—made ""Kick Ass"" as distinctive as it did offensive. ""Kick Ass 2"" doesn't so much surpass ""Kick Ass"" as it holds its own against it. Watch out for the post end credits revelation!",Kick-Ass 2
16,grantss,Not anywhere near as good as the first movie,4,7 July 2014,"Not anywhere near as good as the first movie. The first Kick-Ass was surprisingly good. From the trailers it looked like a low-brow, juvenile, comic-book teen movie. Turns out it was quite funny, reasonably well structured, solidly directed and well acted.Kick-Ass 2, on the other hand, is exactly like I expected the first movie to be, ie a low-brow, juvenile, comic-book teen movie. Quite silly. Has its moments though, so not a total waste. Still, while the first one was in effect a good send-up of comic book action heroes, and quite clever in doing so, this one is not clever at all. Pretty much just gratuitous violence.Hopefully there is no Kick-Ass 3...",Kick-Ass 2
17,view_and_review,Nice Follow Up to the First,6,9 January 2015,"Dave Lizewski aka Kick-Ass is back and he's got a lot more friends and muscles. But don't be fooled, the ripped version of Kick-Ass still gets his butt whooped as much as he did in the first rendition. Mindy, aka Hit Girl, is older and she is still the baddest crime fighter on the planet. Chris D'Amico, aka Red Mist, aka Motherf---er... (Yes he named himself that!!) played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse, did not develop as well as the aforementioned. He actually looks chubbier and he's definitely more of a prick.The premise of Kick-Ass 2 is rather simple: Motherf---er wants to start the first supervillain team to counter the superhero team assembled by those inspired by Kick-Ass. Well, the only way to be a supervillain is to do some supervillainous things. Roll that out there and you have your classic battle of good versus evil.Kick-Ass 2 maintained its humor even though the movie is a lot more serious, or should I say the situations are more serious. Although not quite as good as the first it is only slightly less likable. And I only give part one the edge because it was the first. Still solid and worth watching.",Kick-Ass 2

Brown, Lyndsy Fonseca, Yancy Butler. Disappointing sequel to the comic book adaptation following the aftermath of the titular hero's actions with dire consequences when his rival's villainous desires for payback comes with a dour price to pay for his good intentions. While most of the original's cast is back (particularly the two leads) the film is relatively less fun and more hellbent on depicting violence for violence's sake (yes we get it that real life violence is painful; move on) with the one-note screenplay by the director Jeff Wadlow. It also didn't help having Carrey crap all over the film prior to its release for feeling the 'message' was overwrought in the wake of current real-life violent events involving teenager (but I'm sure the check cleared right, Jim?) So much for a new franchise with something to say.",Kick-Ass 2
19,neil-476,Worthy sequel,8,16 August 2013,"Teenager Dave Lizewski thought he'd try out real-life superheroing (as Kick-Ass), only to find himself drawn into a blood feud between crime boss Frank Damico and framed policeman Big Daddy and his young daughter Hit Girl, as a result of which Damico and Big Daddy both died. In this sequel, Dave joins a group of other superheroes, Damico's son Chris vows vengeance on Kick-Ass, and Mindy (aka Hit Girl) promises her guardian that she will quit superheroing.Aaron Johnson, Chloe Moretz and Christopher Mitz-Plasse reprise Dave, Mindy and Chris, and many of the supporting cast return in this good sequel to an original which I greatly enjoyed despite the opprobrium which was poured on it from some quarters (not least for the ripe language used by Chloe Moretz, 12 years old when she made the film).The language is still ripe, but the violence here is a good deal less graphic than in the previous movie, probably in response to the criticism. It is interesting to note Jim Carrey distancing himself from the violence in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook atrocity - did he not watch the original? As with the original, the story here broadly follows the comic, yet is sufficiently different that neither spoilers the other. And, again, it manages to blend violence, humour and superheroics into an entertaining couple of hours. It is also an excellent vehicle for Chloe Moretz to demonstrate that she is making the transition from child (albeit potty-mouthed child) to young woman.I enjoyed this a lot, as I did the first one.",Kick-Ass 2
20,anaconda-40658,Kicks Twice As Much Ass!,9,3 September 2015,"Kick-Ass 2 (2013): Dir: Jeff Wadlow / Cast: Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Chloe Grace Moretz, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Jim Carrey, Olga Kurkulina: Surprisingly superior sequel that elevates themes such as passion and the humility of being a superhero. Young Red Mist still yearns for revenge on Kick-Ass after the death of his mob father in the first film. After accidentally killing his selfish mother he dons a new costume and changes his name to the Motherf*cker. Meanwhile Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl continue high school. His girlfriend breaks up with him, and she is under guardianship with her father's partner on the police force. She struggles to fit in and he yearns for some action on the street. Central plot regards the Motherf*cker forming a group of super villains including the dominating Mother Russia. Kick-Ass is recruited by Colonel Stars and Stripes who desires justice on the street. Superior screenplay with a fantastic showdown between Hit-Girl and Mother Russia. An improvement for Jeff Wadlow after directing the mediocre Cry Wolf. Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays Kick-Ass whose ability to forgive is put to the test during his quest for common ground with other wannabe superheroes. Chloe Grace Moretz is wonderful as Hit-Girl who knows who she is and cannot adapt to normality. Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays the hilarious self destructing villain. Jim Carrey makes a great cameo as Colonel Stars and Stripes. Olga Kurkulina plays the menacing Mother Russia whose madness knows no limits. Extremely violent but visually stunning with rhyme and reason for donning the mask. Score: 9 / 10",Kick-Ass 2
21,FlashCallahan,We're the heroes.....,7,5 September 2013,"After all the average reviews, I really wasn't really looking forward to this sequel, because the first one was so fantastic, and the new director hasn't really handled such a movie before.So the titular character is back, and the narrative continues from the first movie. Red Mist now becomes a super villain, and enlists recruits, and Kick-Ass joins a hero group led by Jim Carrey.Hit Girl on the other hand tries to live a normal life, out of respect for her father,and turns her back on crime fighting. But old habits Die Hard, and Hit-Girl is never too far away.The first movie was groundbreaking, a refreshing spin on the comic book movie that was violent, profane, and laugh out loud funny.This is more of the same, but because its a sequel, they up the ant a little, and this ruins the momentum of the film, because now the swearing isn't as funny, and for this movie, a lot of the violence is pretty dark, and in one particular scene involving the Mother****er and Night B***h, almost unwatchable.But despite all its shortcomings, its still a fun movie and entertains in droves. The original cast are as good as always, and Moretz once again steals the film from everyone. In one of the most disappointing summers ever, its refreshing that a sequel to a film that didn't need a sequel is enjoyable.So its not as good as the first, and overkills the violence and the language, but its still enjoyable.Plus it has the greatest photo of Nicolas Cage ever...",Kick-Ass 2
22,phd_travel,Enjoyed it - but the violence could have been toned down,7,17 October 2013,"Was Jim Carrey right to condemn the excessive violence in this movie? Yes he was. But I loved the first one so much I had to see the sequel. And I enjoyed it - mostly. Kick Ass 1 was full of unexpected shocking laugh out loud humor with some ""funny"" violence that was part of the plot. Kick Ass 2 still has some of that naughty sense of fun plus the charming leads Aaron Taylor Johnson and Chloe Moretz going through high school stuff and vigilante fighting. Hit Girl is now older and experiencing some teen growing pains still with the foul mouth. Wish they had emphasized the comic parts more and limited the violence because in the second half it just got out of hand - almost Quentin style - too graphic. After all there are enough graphically violent movies - the distinguishing thing about this franchise is it's humor driven story. It just crosses to the wrong side of the line from ""funny"" violence to sickening violence. The way the Russian Mother dispatched the cops was too much. If they make another sequel I hope they bear this in mind.",Kick-Ass 2
23,siderite,What was the point?,6,7 November 2013,"When I first saw the trailer for Kick Ass I thought it was a great idea: a kid attempting to be a superhero and getting his ass kicked because of it, but still managing to save the world. That is what the movie should have been about, there is no doubt in my mind. Enter Big Daddy and Hit Girl which are, for all intents and purposes, real super heroes. That pretty much muddled everything.The sequel goes even further, adding a plethora of superheroes and supervillains who are nothing but guys in funny costumes, implausibly getting away with being public vigilantes and doing stuff before and better than a highly specialized police force that is trained to do things like that. And I just have to ask myself, what is the point? Where does this take us, except in another fantasy superhero world, only lamer than the ""normal"" superhero world where people actually have super powers.And the worst part is that film is not even entertaining. Hit Girl's trying to belong to the highschool clique is just boring. Kick Ass is even less a superhero than in the first film, in spite of all the training that he apparently goes through. Nicholas Cage is gone and the supervillain is a kid with real pain, which somehow becomes the butt of jokes for it. It just doesn't make any sense. The only entertaining part of the movie by far is Mother Russia, but not really in a fun way. And it's too bad, because the actors were good, the direction and budget were OK, all it needed was a compelling story, which just failed to materialize. So I cannot in good conscience call this an average film, I believe it is a failure, although if you did enjoy the first film and you think my objections are baseless, you might enjoy this one as well.",Kick-Ass 2

Meanwhile, the Red Mist plots an act of revenge that will affect everyone Kick-Ass knows.'Kick-Ass 2' begins nicely & maintains its momentum quite ably till the end. Only glitch lies in its predictability, the track of the villain & his army versus Kick-Ass is completely clichéd.

Cinematography & Editing are plain ordinary. Action-Sequences are brutal, but effective. Performance-Wise: Aaron Taylor-Johnson emotes wonderfully as Kick-Ass. Chloe Grace Moretz shines as Hit-Girl.

25,MovieAddict2016,A thoroughly vile film that lacks the cleverness of Matthew Vaughn's touch.,3,8 September 2013,"I wasn't a huge fan of the original ""Kick-Ass"" and thought it fell victim at times to its own satire, but for the most part it was a pretty enjoyable, stylish, witty spin on the comic book genre. It came out right around the same time as the less acknowledged and underrated ""Super!"" starring Rainn Wilson, and both films transplanted the hyper- violent, stylish appeal of comic books into a startlingly realistic setting: the finale of Super ended with Wilson's character going on a killing spree, and the level of realistic carnage was both off-putting and kind of impressive. Matthew Vaughn did something similar with Kick- Ass and often contrasted the silliness against hyper-violence, which turned off some critics but was mostly seen as refreshing.However, I think something novel like Kick-Ass inherently doesn't work well when you try to stretch it out beyond a standalone entry. It's a big challenge to re-do that film's narrative and excess without seeming redundant and crass, which unfortunately is exactly what happens to Kick-Ass 2.From the onset it lacks Vaughn's talent behind the camera (newcomer Jeff Wadlow, who also wrote the script, is a subpar stand-in). While it carries the same stylistic flourishes, everything here is more extreme than the original, and, because it lacks the freshness and novelty as I mentioned above, it often comes across poorly.I think part of the problem in moving past the novelty of Kick-Ass's premise is that the filmmakers feel inclined to up the ante on everything to increasingly create shock value situations. In this film they just come across as exploitative and vile. The violence mostly lacks the gravity of Vaughn's film and falls victim to the first film's entire criticisms -- often the violence you see in Kick-Ass 2 is solely to look cool and make teenage boys giggle, but to anyone who appreciated the entire point of the violence in the first film, I think it will come across as pathetic and disgusting: there are super-stylized scenes such as a lawnmower being used to chew apart a couple of police officers, Jim Carrey being tortured and decapitated (the latter admittedly occurring offscreen); a Russian supervillain being slow-motion stabbed-to-death with shards of glass, and so on and so forth. (These are the extent of the spoilers in my review.)I just found it all to be very crass, and it left a foul taste in my mouth. There's supposedly a scene in the graphic novel where a female character is raped, but the filmmakers don't even really have the nerve to follow through with it in this vile movie: they show the set-up and then leave the rest to the imagination in a perversely casual manner, almost playing it for laughs, which frankly is one of many things wrong with this movie that tries to out-shock and out-kill the original Kick- Ass but ultimately finds itself completely void of the predecessor's wit and ethical implications.Much has been made about Jim Carrey boycotting the movie in post- production and refusing to do promotional rounds for it. Honestly, after seeing the finished film, I don't blame him. As scene-stealing as his extended cameo may be, ultimately this is a film that comes across as missing the entire point of the film that it followed, and one that has been created almost exclusively to pander towards teenage boys who will no doubt find the witless ultra-violence to be quite exhilarating.",Kick-Ass 2
26,KineticSeoul,More doesn't always mean better,6,22 August 2013,"Now I thoroughly enjoyed and was highly entertained by the first ""Kick-Ass"" movie. I simply thought the whole premise and everything is badass. As a matter of fact, it created a wave of these types of vigilante superheroes movies. Especially since a good one can be made without having that big budget or production value...The movie ""Super"" for one. So was looking forward to a sequel...It took a while but it finally happened. Although some viewers seem to like this second installment better than the first. I am going to have to disagree. More simply doesn't mean better. And there is a lot more stuff going on this time around. With separate story arcs going on. Focusing in on Kick-Ass trying to be a get out of his normal life and focus more on being a superhero. And joining up in a group called the Justice Forever. And Hit-Girl trying to leave the vigilante stuff behind and try to be a normal teenage girl. And Chris D'Amico from the first movie, trying to build a super-villain army. And other subplots thrown in. So there is a lot going on. But it just wasn't as immersive or entertaining for that matter. Sure it's still that balls to the wall, crude and violent movie. But the movie itself, seemed like a jumbled mess at times. Hit-Girl again is the most badass and entertaining part about this film, she is simply the show stealer. And her story arc is by far the most entertaining part about this movie. With her trying to fit into the high school life and make friends. There is quite a bit of trendy and shallow humor in this that works. The rest is just passable, although there is few moments in between that stands out. Just because the audience might have liked the first ""Kick-Ass"" doesn't mean they will enjoy this one more or as much. Jim Carrey is also in that as the leader of the vigilante superheroes group. And the guy tries, but it's nothing special that gives off a lasting impression. It's nice to see him in a decent movie this time around after his previous 2 movies. Overall it's a watchable sequel, but disappointing as well.6.4/10",Kick-Ass 2
27,Hellmant,'KICK-ASS 2' kicks all other superhero movies this year's ass!,10,23 August 2013,"'KICK-ASS 2': Five Stars (Out of Five)'KICK-ASS 2' kicks all other superhero movies this year's ass! It's every bit as good as the original. Like the original film, 2010's 'KICK-ASS' (one of my favorite films of that year), it's based on the comic book series by Mark Millar and John Romita, Jr. (this film is based on the comics 'Kick-Ass 2' and 'Hit-Girl'). It's produced by the original film's director Matthew Vaughn (along with Brad Pitt and three others) and released by Vaughn's 'Marv Films'. Vaughn picked Jeff Wadlow (who previously directed the films 'CRY_WOLF' and 'NEVER BACK DOWN') to write and direct the film and actors Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Chloe Grace Moretz, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Clark Duke and Garrett M. Brown all reprise their roles from the original film. They're joined this time around by Jim Carrey, John Leguizamo, Donald Faison and Morris Chestnut (who replaces Omari Hardwick as Detective Marcus Williams). The film picks up where the last movie left off with Dave Lizewski, a.k.a. Kick-Ass (Taylor-Johnson), retired from crime fighting while Mindy Macready, a.k.a. Hit-Girl (Moretz), is still at it (in full force). Kick-Ass has inspired many other average citizens to become superheroes though and decides to go back into action. He first trains with Hit-Girl but when she retires and tries to adapt to high school life he joins a team of new superheroes instead. They're lead by 'Colonel Stars and Stripes' (Carrey). In the meantime Chris D'Amico, now going by the name 'The Motherf.....' (Mintz-Plasse), is plotting his revenge against Kick-Ass (for killing his father, in the original film) and forms a team of supervillains to hunt him down. Violence and carnage ensues. There's so much violence in the film that one of the film's stars, Jim Carrey, retracted his support for the film (due to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting causing a change of heart in him, he says). The violence is out of control in the film (in completely unique and original ways) and I think it might possibly be one of the most violent films I've ever seen but this movie (like the first) still delivers a truly positive message about it; it shows the real life consequences of violence and doesn't encourage it in any way. I really admire Carrey for standing up for what he believes in (even when it's an unpopular stance that most people don't understand) but I don't agree with him (I don't think violence in movies has any relation to violence in life). He still seems like a great guy though and a positive role model and he's amazing in the film (he gives one of his best performances in years and is a scene stealer, despite his limited screen time)!The real star of the film is Hit-Girl and Chloe Grace Moretz is amazing in the role. She rivals the likes of Sigourney Weaver, Linda Hamilton, Uma Thurman, Milla Jovovich, Gina Carano and even Jennifer Lawrence as best ass-kicking action movie heroine. Taylor-Johnson is the relatable heart of the film but Moretz's Hit-Girl is what makes it so entertaining (and her story about trying to adapt in school is both moving and highly amusing). The whole cast is great in the film. It does lack the presence of a Mark Strong type villain but Mintz-Plasse does a pretty good job holding his own in this film. Wadlow does an outstanding job taking over directing duties and his script is brilliant. I haven't read the original source material (to know exactly how faithful these films are) but I know Millar always strongly supports them. The 'KICK-ASS' films just go to new places in the genre and really break into new territory in film. They're so far out there and original that the critics don't know what to make of them (which lead to mostly negative reviews for this film but those critics couldn't be more wrong). This is the best movie I've seen all year and it's arguably just as good as the beloved cult classic original!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlUvgTS58bk",Kick-Ass 2
28,thesar-2,Part Two Syndrome,7,29 December 2013,"I am a super-hero/comic-book fan, namely the silver screen adaptations, but I always dread the part twos of any of their series. Kick-Ass 2 falls right in line with my dread for the first follow-up.Like Superman II, The Dark Knight, Spider-Man 2 and many, many more, our friendly neighborhood crime-fighter either loses their powers or wants to and it's a great bulk of the film to get them to regain their muscle to understand their ""great responsibility."" Kick-Ass 2 – and yeah, this is a spoiler on the plot – doesn't sway from that cliché by having the best character from the original, Hit-Girl, quit the business.Not only is this ploy worn-out and overused, it's flat out annoying because we all know both: the powers will return, but it'll take way too long and there's usually never a guarantee there'll be a part III, so why waste this precious screen time on the same ole trick?But, beyond this lazy writing, I did have a good time with this movie. It certainly wasn't perfect or close to as great as I felt the original was, but it still was a lot of fun. They didn't fail to remember these movies are rated R for a reason and I appreciate unapologetic filmmaking.Basically, Dave/Kick-Ass has given upagain for clichéd reasons, but when he's needed, he's abandoned by Mindy/Hit-Girl and spends a chunk of the movie getting her back as she's obviously and absolutely irreplaceable. The past plays forward as good vs. evil gets gray.While, again, not perfect, it's a ton of fun and if you're a fan of the original, you'll probably like this slightly lesser follow-up.* * * Final thoughts: I don't blame Jim Carrey – who was awesome here – for speaking out against violence in films, but to be shocked this had too much school violence, which it doesn't, is just plain dumb ignorance. He could've starred in ""Brokeback Mountain 2: Straight Shootin'"" and be surprised he had to be in a gay sex scene. I sincerely hope he didn't think his outburst hurt the box office. That was just the ignorance of the audience. This was a very fun movie to watch!",Kick-Ass 2

30,Robert_duder,Perhaps an unnecessary sequel that provides more and more of the same,7,31 August 2013,"It took me a long time to finally watch Kick-Ass and when I did, I loved it. It was a brilliant spoof/satire movie of the entire Superhero genre that was a filthy gratuitous action flick. The characters were over the top and insanely fun. Because it gained a cult status it was inevitable we would see a sequel. I have no doubt that they put a lot of work into this and the makers really tried to provide a worthy sequel. It was worthy. I'm not sure it was necessary and I think it felt like they tried too hard to capture that unique satirical feel that the original had. They absolutely stuck to the unwritten sequel rule of everything has to be bigger, bolder and more over the top. The film takes the gratuitous violence and bad language from the first film and tosses it into the dirt by amping up both by 50. It was almost a slasher flick considering how much blood spurted this time around. I think they would have done better to ditch Kick-Ass a little more and maybe focus the sequel on Hit-Girl which they sort of did anyways because she walked away from the first one as a crowd favourite. Kick-Ass 2 was about tying up loose ends and about our favourite young super heroes entering an adult world. It worked but just by a hair.Aaron Taylor-Johnson returns to the title role as Kick-Ass. I didn't feel like he had the same awkward lovable quality that he seemed to capture in the first film. Still he plays the lead well and will certainly have a future ahead of him. As I mentioned Hit-Girl came out of the first film with a cult following. I love Chloe-Grace Moretz. I think she has a HUGE future ahead of her and is a Hollywood It Girl to say the least. She returns as more of a focus in the sequel and she is as tough as nails and filthy mouthed as ever. She definitely gets some of the best lines and scenes in the film and the story covers more of her character arc as she tries to come to terms with her father's death and her alter-ego, and surviving High School. She has so much charisma on screen and is just fun to watch. She nails this role. Christopher Mintz-Plasse also returns but this time as thee super villain. He is as good as he always, over the top, foolish but far more maniacal this time around. His quest for vengeance against Kick-Ass drives the story and he is a great villain in a completely outrageous and silly way. A lot of the supporting cast returns again as well and they get some more scenes but nothing that really makes them stand out. They are good in their roles and they serve their purpose but they aren't outstanding. Morris Chestnut, Clark Duke and Augustus Pew are all good in their roles but could use more development in general. The newcomers to the cast were all great. I think Jim Carrey did a great job as their beloved leader. I would loved to have seen him in it more but he does get some great lines and you could see a little of that old school charm that made him great in the late 90's, early 2000's. Was also good to see John Leguizamo in a small role as the villain's right hand man. His role was small but decent. Lindy Booth was also a great addition as Night B%&*h. Perhaps one of the comedy/satire highlights of the film was the group of villains put together by Mintz-Plasse including the amazing Olga Kurkulina as Mother Russia.Jeff Wadlow co-writes and directs the sequel. He has some experience but I'm not sure he has quite the chops to take this on and make what the first one was. However, he did a good job and as I said before you could absolutely tell they were trying very hard to live up to fans expectations. It was entertaining beginning to end. There were a few gags that I thought were completely uncharacteristic to Kick-Ass (the atrocious and ridiculous scene where the mean girls are forced to vomit...amongst other things...) just as a for instance. That was too far and simply stupid. However, everyone in the theatre howled like they were 2 year olds on the playground. I think most fans of the original will feel like I did. It was fun but nowhere near the first one. It did however close off the entire story nicely and even had some real heart behind it so kudos to them for that. Don't do a third because this was already stretching it. 7.5/10",Kick-Ass 2
31,bowmanblue,Enjoyed it more than the original,8,21 July 2014,"Okay, I'll start by confessing that I'm possibly the ONLY person in the world who HATED Kick Ass (1). I really don't know why I bothered to watch the sequel, but, for some reason, I'm really glad I did. It just seemed to be everything that the first one wasn't. I found it cleverer, funnier, more action-packed and more (and I think this is the word I'm looking for) 'real' than the original.If you don't know, Kick Ass 2 is about a gang of everyday folk who decide that they've had enough with crime and therefore don suits and 'fight back.' Of course, not being blessed with Spiderman or Superman's powers, they have to make do with wetsuits for costumes and baseball bats for weapons. I found it was at its best when it was showing how these sorts of 'superheroes' would be portrayed by the media and how they would find life really trying to do what they do.If you're wondering how much Jim Carrey is in it, I think it adds up to about seven minutes of screen time. He famously distanced himself from the film after starring in it due to its violent content – a strange action. After all, the original was pretty violent and you'd think he would have read the script before he signed on! Anyway, if you like action-satires then I think that would describe this film best. Interestingly enough, I seem to be in the minority (yet again) in my praise for Kick Ass 2. Most fans seem to view it as inferior to the original. Personally, I thought it was everything the original should have been.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Kick-Ass 2
32,Cineanalyst,The Kids are Growing Up; This Sequel Isn't,5,7 July 2021,"I forgot ""Kick-Ass 2"" beat ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" (2017) to the punch of a teen superhero flick imitating ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" (1986)--and without being so blatant about it. Unfortunately, the rest largely abandons the clever comic-book and cinematic deconstruction of the first ""Kick-Ass"" (2010) and retaining merely a more-juvenile rehash of its violence and foul language set to pop tunes and a leitmotif that sounds an awful lot like the much-used ""Adagio in D Minor,"" or ""Strobe,"" it borrowed from ""Sunshine"" (2007). In its place, this sequel mostly only adds teen-movie clichés--especially being derivative of ""Mean Girls"" (2004) and, ironically, ""Carrie"" (1976 and 2003). It's generally a mess, too; even the characters' ages and the whatever number of years are supposed to have transpired since the first movie are all over the place.The first movie worked because of the interaction between its three superheroes' different relationships with comic books: Kick-Ass making comics a reality to the point of becoming one, Big Daddy turning reality into comics, and Hit-Girl perhaps being the most real, or authentically of comics, of them all in being cartoonishly, supernaturally heroic. The sequel tries to invert this somewhat by Kick-Ass trying to become a real superhero like her, and Hit-Girl trying to become a normal teenager like him. Too bad none of it amounts to much more than training montages and the aforementioned cribbing of teen flicks. In place of Nick Cage's quasi-Batman figure, we get a Superman instead--in the sense that Jim Carrey's character forms a Justice League and is a born-again Christian type, goody two shoes (no cussing and no bullets (although why Kick-Ass suddenly has qualms with shooting baddies makes one wonder whether the filmmakers even saw the last movie, but I digress)).There's also the inevitable counteracting team of supervillains, although all of that gets ridiculous. That would-be-Oscar-winner Daniel Kaluuya plays one of those ""archetype"" baddies, named ""Black Death,"" does rather prove the movie's own criticism of such comic-book fare. Only problem is that it's, especially lacking the narrative tricks of deconstruction of the original, self-defeatingly the exact thing that it ridicules. They even replaced the better Quicksilver from the first movie.The only payoff is from the buildup of Hit-Girl rising like a dark knight... well, very much like ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) and ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012), come to think of it--motorcycle included, to reemerge as the hero comic-book movies deserve. I still love the scene of her atop the van. The rest of the movie surrounding that, not so much. Too bad they screwed up this sequel so bad that Chloë Grace Moretz has stated her refusal to do a third one. Fortunately, though, there is something of a Hit-Girl movie made since in ""Shadow in the Cloud"" (2020).",Kick-Ass 2
33,g-bodyl,Very Enjoyable Sequel!,9,20 November 2014,"Kick-Ass 2 is the sequel to 2010's surprise hit, Kick-Ass. Kick-Ass brought a sense of realism to the world of superheroes, and the sequel does more of the same. It doesn't quite reach the perfect level of the first film, but this film is still very enjoyable and a pleasure to watch. The film was critically lambasted for no reason, but fans of the first film should definitely seek this out. The dark comedy is prevalent as well as the extreme violence and cursing which made the first film a hit. The tone of the film changes from time to time, but for each particular scene, the changing tones actually work in the movie's favor.Jeff Wadlow's film brings us back our heroes, Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl. After the events of the first film, the Red Mist has a vendetta out for Kick-Ass because he caused his father's death. After Kick-Ass fails to get Hit-Girl out of hiding after she was persuaded to leave her costume behind, Kick-Ass joins a legion of heroes in order to defeat the super-villains out there.This film is well-acted for the most part. Aaron Taylor-Johnson does a good job as Kick-Ass, but Chloe Grace Moretz is the life and grace of the movie since the film puts more emphasis on Hit-Girl this time around. Christopher Mintz-Plasse may be the weakest link of the film. His character is just too whiny and arrogant for my taste. Jim Carrey makes a welcome appearance as Colonel Stripes and Stars.Overall, Kick-Ass 2 is a much better film than the critics give it credit for. It has a finely-tuned balance of comedy and action and I love the realism it gives to the super-hero genre. The film gets emotional at times, but comedy is prevalent here. This film spoofs 2004's Mean Girls is quite a few funny scenes. The violence is extreme here and there is no shortage of blood, so that is a relief. A very fine sequel this film is. I rate this film 9/10.",Kick-Ass 2

35,A_Different_Drummer,one of the most exploitative films ever ... and a rising star,1,31 October 2013,"First, let's do the real backstory, that is, the real world backstory. KA1 was a pretty interesting movie, with some nice ideas, some nice execution, and a decent plot arc. Arguably, the best thing in KA1 was Chloë Grace Moretz, who stole entire scenes from more seasoned actors with an impish grin and comic timing that Jack Benny would have envied. Ironically, since both KA1 and KA2 are about evil, you need to understand that the real evil happened after KA1 was made, when a new production team got hold of the rights to the sequel. Now, there are bad sequels and there are worse sequels, but the baddest of them all is a sequel that, from the getgo, seeks to exploit the vulnerabilities of its audience. And that's what we have here. Essentially a moronic story with episodes of violence bordering on the pornographic, interspaced with interesting (albeit undeveloped) secondary arcs that riff off, for example, MEAN GIRLS. To call this movie an abomination is unfair to real abominations. Through it all, however, Chloë Grace Moretz shines in her reprise of an older more mature Hit Girl, pretty much stealing every scene she is in - again. She is photogenic, athletic, charismatic, and knows how to deliver dialogue. We'll be seeing more of her.",Kick-Ass 2

Leading a gang of super-villains he sets out to destroy everything he can until he finds Kick-Ass. I have to start by saying that I wasn't a fan of the first one. I'm not really sure what I didn't like but it just didn't click with me so I was not looking forward to this one and had low expectations. I don't know if that played a factor or not but this was surprisingly good and I liked it much more then the first one. As a warning (if you want to see this you may not need it) the movie really goes for shock value throughout most of it and is a little over the top, but all that actually fits in a movie like this.

38,callanvass,"Fairly enjoyable, but incredibly disappointing at the same time",6,4 March 2014,"Dave Lizewski is bored of his lifestyle. Even his girlfriend Katie fails to create any sparks for him. Dave requests help from Mindy (Hit-Girl) to make him a more effective superhero. Dave goes through rigorous training treatments to improve his skills. When Mindy is caught by her guardian, Det. Marcus Williams, he prohibits her from fighting crime, and seeing Dave. To make matters worse for Dave, Kaite dumps him. Dave joins a group of masked crusaders that were recruited by Col.Stars and Stripes, managing to reinvigorate Dave's life. Meanwhile, Chris D'Amico is still pining for revenge on Kick-Ass for killing his father. He creates an evil alter-ego ""The Motherf####@@@"" , acquires some deadly people to stop Kick-Ass. I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy this sequel to a certain extent. It has plenty of action and a cast with plenty of energy to make this an entertaining time waster. But it should have been so much more. The first movie was a one of a kind movie that felt completely genuine and real. It was a look at how corrupt society is these days. This one lacks that riveting emotional element that made the first movie so memorable. The set-up here feels phony like many sequels tend to be. Despite the incorporation of new characters, they felt pointless to me. The idea of normal people being inspired by Dave's heroics was good, but the characters aren't interesting enough. Also, I hated some of the things that went down in this sequel. Lyndsey Fonseca is barely in this film. The way she broke up with Dave was downright moronic. It negated all the character changes she made in the first film, and I didn't buy it for a minute. It was a stupid decision. Unlike many people, the explicit violence didn't bother me. I did think they were being violent for the sake of sometimes. The violence in the original was very stylized and effective, but it felt forced here. It also resorts to puking and pooping gags at times, which made me shake my head. Those don't belong in a Kick-Ass film. Christopher Mintz's D'Amico character goes through some ludicrous changes. I liked the idea of him turning into a sadistic person without a conscience, but his ""Motherfu@@@@@@@"" character gets old fast. There are so many ""Motherf@@@"" references you can say before it gets tiring. It wore thin quickly. The finale is complete anarchy and wildly entertaining. It was the most exciting part of the movie. The cast is terrific. Aaron Taylor-Johnson owns as Dave/Kick-Ass once again, but the part doesn't feel as special. Chloe Moretz steals the show again. She has a lot more to play with this time around. I did think the ""maturity"" phase she went though in this movie was a bit silly, but she made it work. Her chemistry with Taylor-Johnson is awesome as well. Jim Carrey ostensibly hated this movie because of the extreme violence. Nevertheless, he was fun in his part, throwing in a couple of great one- liners. Mintz-Plasse is OK in this one. He was fun in the first movie, but his part felt like a more crazier version of McLovin, from Superbad. Lindy Booth is cute, but bland as Dave's new love interest. Faison, Brown, Chestnut, Leguizamo, all do well in their parts. OverallI didn't hate this movie at all, was just extremely disappointed in the sloppy execution. Bigger doesn't necessarily mean better, that's what so many people forget to realize. It's definitely worth a watch, but don't expect a classic like the first Kick-Ass. I'd still gladly watch a third installment6.7",Kick-Ass 2
39,westsideschl,A Sequel Just for Money,2,8 February 2014,"The original Kick Ass was a well acted, directed and creative action fantasy superhero story (I gave it 5 stars.) It had an unusual quality and personality that separated it from almost all films of that genre. It was memorable and could have joined the Swedish ""GirlDragon Tattoo"" in status. Kick Ass 2 with a different writer and director ruined any opportunity at sustaining that legacy. In place of difficult practiced performance and action scenes we were given the alternative of countless nauseous brief & changing camera angles as a cheap substitute. Thus, creating a just not believable (almost laughable) illusion of action. Even the helmeted sub for Mindy on a hot bike came off as a gratuitous cheap stunt trick. Another cheap prop was her electronic device creating a not believable vomiting/diarrhea CGI scene. Having Mindy go through the teen H.S. romance scene was a tiresomely clichéd plot hook designed to bring in the monied Disney-like audience for the producers. The excessive profanity/obscenity ridden dialogue was another cheap pointless filler for having to come up with a creatively meaningful story. An acting superstar like Chloë is now in a position to insist on creative storytelling and not just more ""movies-made-for-money"".",Kick-Ass 2
40,Bored_Dragon,Did you recognize Jim Carrey?,8,30 December 2019,"The sequel further elaborates on the story from the first film. Kick-Ass has inspired many citizens, so there are many new ""superheroes"", but also ""super villains"" that our heroes need to stop. As it continues to the first movie in the same manner, ""Kick-Ass 2"" loses a lot due to its lack of originality and surprise factor. The story dilutes with cliché teenage drama and romance, at times even pathetic, and the part of the story that sticks to the tried-and-tested recipe from the original movie tries to make up for the lack of new ideas by introducing too many new characters and a story that is so over-the-top that it loses every touch with reality. The soundtrack is also weaker. On the other hand, with more diversity and faster tempo, as well as many cheap but effective gags and jokes, the movie gets fun, and it may even have been more fun for me than the first. All in all, a superbly entertaining pastime that doesn't contain anything remarkable enough to stay in your memory after the closing credits. But still extremely fun, plus Chloë Grace Moretz...8/10",Kick-Ass 2
41,ironhorse_iv,This movie was pretty kick ass! I like it.,7,21 August 2013,"I thought the movie was extremely strong in this one. Not, as good as the last movie, but still worth watching in the movie theater. There were a few spots where the dialogue was a little clunky, but the action and humor really does make it fun to watch. I thought it was pretty solid for a sequel to 2010's movie with the same name. I felt the spirit of the original film still held in tact and honestly, I thought the fights were amazing. The pacing of the film was a lot to handle, but it kept the movie from being boring. It felt as fast as reading a graphic novel, turning pages and not staying on one part for too long. Very entertaining. Kick-Ass 2 is based on the comic book of the same name and another comic book Hit Girl, both by Mark Millar and John Romita, Jr. The film was written and directed by Jeff Wadlow and co-produced by Matthew Vaughn, who directed the first film. The main problem I can say about this film is that they add together the Kick Ass 2 comic with the Hit Girl comic, which led to it feeling like two completely different films. It would have worked better if they adapted the comics into two different movies. In the film, Dave Lizewski AKA Kick Ass (Aaron Taylor Johnson) and Mindy Macready AKA Hit Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) has retired from fighting crime, only to be inspired by other citizens who wants to become super heroes. While, Hit Girl instead focus on making a normal life for herself, Kick Ass joins a group of superheroes citizens known as Justice Forever leaded by Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey). As the same time, as this, Chris D'Amico (Christopher Mintz Plasse) upset about his father's death in the previous film, started to go mad with revenge and power to the point, he dons himself a new suit and mask. Chris create a new army to face Justice Forever; for once and for all, battle for the city. Honestly, I can do with a few scenes out of this film. I just didn't like the 'Mean Girls' Mindy's storyline. It was distracting and boring. I found it to be some of the weakest scenes. I just can't get behind the Union J's cameo. The crowd control shock baton joke was pretty bad and gross. It wasn't needed. The film tries to stay true to the comic book, but it change a lot of things. Kate (Lyndsy Fonseca) was mostly written out, and replace by another superhero (Lindy Booth). I don't know, why Kate was even in the film, if they were going that direction. So, a lot of things that were meant for the Kate character, end up happening to Lindy Booth's character. The rape scene is pretty tamed unlike the comics. Honestly, I don't know if she was raped or not. I thought the movie did enough to explain the background story of the teams, but it needed some more to make them stand out. I do like the Mother Russia's character. She (Olga Kurkulina) was pretty intense. Another character worth noting is Dr. Gravity (Donald Faison). He was fun to be with. I wish they could have done more conflict between Dave and Todd (Augustus Prew). That felt unsolved. I just can't get past the fact that our hero is a nearly useless who has to be continuously rescued by real heroes whom he repays by getting them horribly killed or orphaned. There is a post credit scene worth checking if you want. Its look like there will be a sequel. I know everyone is mad at Jim Carrey for not promoting the film due to his reaction to the film's violence, but he should had figure out that, before he signed on to star in the film. 2010's Kick Ass was pretty violent. I know 2012's Sandy Hook elementary school was a tragedy, but Jim Carrey should had thought long and hard, before choosing this role, and shouldn't bad mouth it after the fact. Let's look at his character, he is an ex Mafia hit man that turn into a super hero. He doesn't use a gun. If anything, this movie isn't about shooting innocents children. It's more about fighting crime. If it do influence people, I would think people be shooting up criminals instead of innocent people. The film does concentrated on the consequences of violence rather than the violence itself. While, in the comic book, there was a scene of children getting killed by the villain; at less, the film version doesn't have that scene. Another complain by critics is the portrayal of the Hit Girl's character. In this film, Hit Girl become more sexual active. I don't mind, in the film that Mindy and David got closer to each other, because in the movie they are no more than 4 years apart. Dave isn't really trying after her and he didn't take advantage of her. The critics complain with the violence, and language of the last movie, and for this movie, it got pretty tamed down. There isn't that much gore and language. It's more control in this film. They even mention that superheroes don't curse or kill people. In the end, Kick Ass 2 was pretty cool, that got some pretty hard criticize that it didn't deserved. Go see it for yourself, it's pretty entertaining.",Kick-Ass 2

43,Reno-Rangan,Non-stop fun which crowded with costume Heroes,8,26 August 2013,"I took time to review this movie after the watch. This movie was not what I expected, you know what the first installment was better than this sequel. This 'Kick-ass 2' had so many jokes which are adult comedies, sometime those were too disgusting especially the puking one, ew. Don't forget the powerful gangster Mark Strong, the villain of the first movie, that led the movie to its success. But in this part, there are many villains and too weak in strength, I think except the 'Mother Russia'. And other villains are hyped too much for their strength in the intro then they were no way near to as what they were supposed to. Too many bad words used in this movie compared to first which makes not a family and kids friendly movie, just like the 'Scary movie'. Of course it was R rated movie, just for your information.The Jim Carrey's role was small but liked though expected lots more from him. When it comes to the story, it was not that great but okayish type, remember I loved first part story very much. 'Kick-Ass' was one of my favourite action movie, the end fights were breathtaking especially the bazooka and flying thing they used. In this story there are too many characters that use superhero costumes and too many superhero names which sometimes looks like some Halloween party. The main character 'Kick-Ass' was slightly disappears when other costume characters in action, that's so disappointing. On the other side of the story the 'Hit-Girl' meets 'Mean Girls' and that's an off the track of what this movie is supposed to be. Chloe was excellent, she was a little girl at first, now in this she has grown up and for the next she will be a woman. There was no time for character developments, totally randomized in its appearances, except the Mindy who gets the cooled portion of the movie but slightly drags her role with 'Mean Girls' stuff.We can say this movie is kind of an American version of 'Crow Zero' with men and women in fancy dresses. This movie keeps you alive because of its adult comedies and of course the awesome stunts. I liked the movie but not as much of its first part. I felt somewhere between two movies the bridge misled us. Better the third one should be very appropriate for its title. I'll tell something that this movie will definitely entertain you, no doubt about that but it won't be your favourite product of the year. It is hard to recommend it for one, like I said if you need entertainment then go for it but don't expect like the first, it was more like a youngster's movie.8/10",Kick-Ass 2
44,Floated2,Doesn't Live Up to the Original but is Solid,7,19 August 2014,"Kick-Ass 2- the sequel to Kick-Ass (2010). The built-in challenge for Kick-Ass 2, which is in the difficult position of following up a film that caught lightning in a bottle. Chloë Grace Moretz, more so hardcore swear words as she cartwheeled, flipped and flew through the air, shooting, stabbing and strangling several dozen scumbags, like a mini- ninja killing machine. And though Hit-Girl can still deliver some spectacular Kill Bill-worthy moves—and she does still own the screen in every scene she's in—it just isn't the same coming from a longer, lankier, almost-woman.The new film starts right about where the old one left off: on the front steps of the local high school where Dave, Kick-Ass (Aaron Taylor- Johnson), is now a confident upperclassman and Mindy, Hit Girl, is a lowly freshman. With his social life now in a good place, Dave is itching to up his superhero skill-set from barely capable to Hit Girl level, and Mindy reluctantly agrees to be his sensei. This arrangement lasts until they take to the streets for a test drive which ends badly and gets Mindy grounded, leaving Dave to go it alone on night patrols. You know, just like the old days. Kic-Ass 2 doesn't have the same spark and originality of the original but it is still quite entertaining. The gruesome violence is still there, the visuals are still stunning, and the character costumes are well creative. Jim Carrey though featured heavy in trailers and is one of the top billed actors is not in the film as much as it is made out to be. He enters around 24:30 minutes in, and makes his presence well. Although his character does have some memorable scenes he does not make it out too long, as we see his death come near (1:02:05) then finally (1:03:50). The villains were a great touch for Kick-Ass as a counterpart. One scene in particular is where we see the female villain (Mother Russian) defeating plenty of cops that come out in the street. Along the way she defeats them in one scene throwing a lawnmower on top of the car scrapping them out. We do see the near which was not as predictable though (1:32:45).

45,eddie_baggins,Has it's moments but not even close to touching the original,5,6 January 2014,"Let's be brutally honest here, Kick-Ass 2 isn't even half the film the original was. The original Kick-Ass came bursting onto our screens in 2010 with a kinetic energy thanks to the ace direction of Brit Matthew Vaughn and the brilliant casting of all main players not least in the relatively fresh faced Chloe Grace Moretz as profanity spouting Hit Girl and the best Nicolas Cage performance in eons. Kick-Ass 2 however came limping onto screens with little to no fanfare from critics and audiences alike, a stark contradiction to its predecessor. With this lacklustre reception it would be safe to assume the film is a lost cause but I myself was pleasantly surprised by the enjoyment levels found in the unquestionably lesser of the two films.Kicking proceedings off a couple of years after the first film Kick-Ass 2 focuses its attention on an ever growing up Hit Girl and her travails in High School and with adoptive policeman dad Marcus (Chestnut) while Kick-Ass himself finds himself joined up with a rag tag group of wannabe heroes lead by the seriously underused Jim Carrey as Colonel Stars and Stripes. This is the major flaw and missed opportunity of the film for one feels that the group of heroes in particular Jim Carrey's Colonel had a lot more to give to the film in regards to heart and comedic moments yet you barely get a chance to learn their names. Mintz-Plasse as the now monikered Mother F$#*$*r is also a slightly underused presence with blame for this falling to new director/screenwriter Wadlow.Vaughn did such a fantastic job as the original helmer that it was always going to be a tough job for whoever took on the project once he left the sequel and while Wadlow does an amicable take the films action and whip smart dialogue is nearly non-existent when compared to the first, where the originals violence felt shocking and thrilling here it seems forced and where words out of Hit Girls mouth bought gasps now they merely fall flat. The film as a whole to looks and feels cheap with production values not dissimilar to straight to DVD fare which is strange considering the films quite adequate budget.Kick-Ass 2 is an enjoyable disposable movie with enough originality that could have been so much better yet oh so much worse.

Was it supposed to be a straight-up exploitation film? Perhaps a send-up of the exploitation film movement, along the lines of ""Death Proof""? Some sort of social commentary on how the police have surrendered the streets in some places and allowed a kind of vigilantism to move in and fill the void? Maybe it was supposed to be something else altogether... I recall thinking its predecessor, a 2010 effort directed by Matthew Vaughn, just about deserved the passing grade, but this sequel has completely misunderstood why that film worked to the extent that it did and has even enriched its flaws to create what is, I think, a bit of a mess.""Kick-Ass 2"" covers the exploits of two returning protagonists, an ordinary young man and an ordinary young girl, as they battle the elements in modern New York City. If, like me, you couldn't exactly remember what had happened at the culmination of the first film, the original Kick-Ass, a green jumpsuit clad kid named Dave Lizewski (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), is, we find out, bored after having given up the superhero game and wants back in. His partner in anti-crime, Hit-Girl, otherwise known as Mindy (Chloë Grace Moretz), meanwhile grieves the demise of her father, whose death at the end of the last film, I have to admit, I had completely forgotten about, and carries on with her alternate life behind the back a policeman who now acts as her guardian. One thing leads to another and Lizewski winds up, albeit out of fighting shape, finding Hit-Girl to climb back into the world.But against whom might they have their quarrel? Enter Chris D'Amico, another character barely out of their teenaged years who is played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse and who, after losing his mother in a tanning bed accident, finds himself both orphaned and enraged enough to become a super-villain. There is an odd psychoanalytical moment whereby he dons a leather outfit he finds amidst his recently dearly-deceased possessions and decides, therefore, on calling himself 'The Mother****er'. Ha Ha Ha.""Kick-Ass 2"" is certainly thrown together with a fair amount of raw energy, but it doesn't understand that, ultimately, restraint in cinema is crucial to a film's effect on an audience, irrespective of what the project is or what the approach to a subject matter it might be taking on. There are several sequences in the film, each of them action scenes, which, if I described them individually, might sound quite striking, but do not actually amount to a sum total of anything at all when strung together but for how the project is handled.Where director Jeff Wadlow missteps is, I think, in his thinking that bigger is better which, when executed off the back of material such as this, can implode catastrophically when it doesn't come off - here, it is the peppering of the film with an array of not only good-guys, but villains as well, to create a kind of chaos which Vaughn almost always had on a leash. It is burning proof, if such a thing was even needed, that ""Jaws"" did not need three sharks during its finale to work, and indeed got by quite handsomely with just the one.Character-wise, Lizewski is so much weaker here than before; driven not by a burning desire to rid the streets of crime or by an anger which pushes him to the brink of despair that he knows full well he will die if he doesn't make a jump from one rooftop to another during his self-imposed training, but by nothing at all - merely being bored of what's on the television. Having suited himself back up, he falls in with a group of people who call themselves Justice for All, who are all essentially doing the same thing, but an actual adult leads the team and does most of the fighting anyway. So what?Later on, about half-way through, there is an absurd interlude involving Hit-Girl whereby her strand depicts her doing the opposite to Lizewski and is forced away from fighting crime to become 'normal' again: going to school, having sleepovers and talking girly to girly girls. To what avail is any of this? Because there isn't really enough in the opening two acts, and because the second unit material takes precedence, there is nothing really there in terms of heart to propel anything into a big dénouement.Wadlow's tone is, again, scatter-shot at best; pausing for these moments of real tenderness and contemplation in-between bulldozing the frame with explosions; instants of terrific violence and the profanity which might sound grown up, but really isn't. Several of the characters in the film are, at once, grieving for the loss of fathers; grieving for the loss of mothers; experiencing breakups and fondness for new people and living born-again existences, but where does any of it actually stand up to be counted?The film is at its sharpest, not when it is depicting its characters driving blades into the bodies of others, but when it sends the super-hero genre up: villains making up fake backstories because they think they need them, subversions of evil lairs for climactic showdowns, the daft names comic book characters have and where they come from in the first place. But, ultimately, this is the sort of film that passes between hands in the school playground. You know the kinds of films: somebody's bigger brother, who's old enough and already left school, has bought it on DVD, but it's made its way through one means or another into lesser circles. Sooner or later, word gets around and everybody wants a weekend to watch it. For the rest of us, we can only watch on, sometimes with our mouth agape, in either stunned awe or offence, at what is unfolding in front of us, hoping we'll pick a better film to watch next time.",Kick-Ass 2

The second movie was - no surprise- not as good as the first. The humor was terrible; bad jokes, low quality scenes, racist lines. The action scenes were okay, could have been better though. The final battle, too cliché, as was the whole plot. Especially the teenage-high school drama, wasn't even fit for the movie. Things got better when Hit girl came back and took action, but before that the whole movie was one death after the other with no interest at all. The performances were okay, Jim Carey was a nice surprise and Moretz was great as well. The costumes were good too. But other than that, Kick Ass 2 didn't live up to the expectations. It just was too so-so for a sequel of Kick Ass. So 3 out of 10, could have been 2, if my friends hadn't insist on the Union J factor.",Kick-Ass 2
48,leplatypus,Mine was nearly kicked ... again ... (screen),4,3 November 2013,"It's funny but so far, each KA movie had me facing abusive people that i had to put back. This time, it was I against subway controllers, just before getting out the station to go to multiplex. They tried to make me a swindler in spite of my papers were OK. I really liked when i told them to hurry because i had a movie to catch and to check their procedures because they looked like incompetents!So, here, I'm at last in the dark room to watch a movie from my actual best comics writer, Mark Millar. Unlike KA1, this time i have read the comics, so i knew the story and could notice the differences: The first change was tied to KA1 as the movie ended happily for Dave and Katie unlike the comics. So, now, in a single scene, the paradox is corrected and Katie is written off: it's a pity as we lost totally Lindsy for the rest of the movie!Then, KA2 sticks really to the comics and the Hit-girl tie-in and it's about the evolution of superheroes mythology that Millar wanted: the hidden identity and the group action. In that perspective, the movie is as funny as the comics as those points are really twisted, told with humor and drama as well. Millar has really understood the genre and offers something less intellectual than Moore's Watchmen but also less dark than Miller. The heart of the movie lies as Spidey in the fact that the hero is a nobody that could have been me or you.However, i find the movie a bit less interesting than the first because with Lindsy, Nic Cage gone, we are now stuck with only KA, the MFK and Hit-girl: The first two are OK, especially with Chris taking MFK over the top but Moretz is just boring: she's grumpy all along the movie and she's is really too mature for the part! What about Jim Carrey: well, he is totally unrecognizable. What about the violence? Well, not more or not less than the usual production as lately we have seen a snow white stabbing her stepmother!The final is interesting as the comics and the movie really diverge and it will be interesting to see how KA3 the movie will go back to the comics (and if mine will be again kicked for a third time in a row!)",Kick-Ass 2
49,leonblackwood,No way as good as the original. 3/10,3,21 December 2013,"Review: This movie is know way as good as the original. The whole revenge thing went way too far and a lot of the wanna be super heroes were quite ridiculous. Hit Girl is the only character in the whole movie that had some substance. The director done a really bad job out of a good concept, which is a shame because I enjoyed the original. The action scenes went way too far, especially when the Hit Girl was on top of the van. The main character Kick Ass, was also annoying in this movie and his hair was a bad choice by the make up department. This is proof that some things should just be left alone.Round-Up: This only reason why I gave this movie 3 stars is because of Hit Girl, who is having a hard time growing up in this movie. Jim Carrey was being his usual crazy self in this film and his character would have been much better if the film was half decent, but It just didn't work. The movie was left open for a 3rd outing in this franchise, but it needs a lot of work.

Oh boy, did this sequel go awry. Its unbalanced plot, clichéd-ridden narrative and non-stylistic violence allowed this sequel to wallow in its pointlessness. Kick-Ass trains with Hit-Girl to become a real superhero, and joins forces with other individuals wearing costumes to stop a band of supervillains from killing everyone Kick-Ass loves.The underlying problem with this sequel is the story it tries to convey. It's predecessor relished in portraying real-life characters trying to be better versions of themselves in the real world. That's abolished here, when everyone is parading around in onesies and lycra costumes. It's no longer the real world, but a heightened variation of a generic comic book city. The purpose, motives and personable charisma of Dave, Chris and Mindy have now dissipated. Poof! Gone. Instead, both of Dave's best friends now acknowledge his superhero identity and choose to become heroes as well. Do not, I repeat, do not get me started on Todd. I have never seen a more obvious plot device in all my life. Wadlow fails to balance the dark humour with the violence, and instead becomes a splintered mess of weird pacing and excessive profanity.Nothing really happens? Sure, Carrey is doing his best to not be Ace Ventura and Mother Russia was an absolute beast. But when Dave, the character we cling on to as the likeable moral compass, has as much charisma as a glass of water, it's pretty much game over. Frustrating really, considering Moretz was brilliant as Hit-Girl and Leguizamo was provided with some decent lines of dialogue. Yet, the ""intense"" and infrequent action scenes were plagued with obvious green screen cuts. And practically every character had daddy issues for the sake of a flimsy vengeance storyline. Just give me more of Hit-Girl trying to adjust to ordinary life (standalone sequel/prequel maybe?). Y'know, good stuff.",Kick-Ass 2
51,Vartiainen,Lacks the novelty and the charm of the original,4,31 January 2014,"If the first Kick-Ass movie was that cool cousin, who's a bit rough around the edges and definitely a badass, then this film is that young brat, who tries to imitate said cousin, but only partly succeeds.The first Kick-Ass film had a few good things going for it. It had a completely new take on the superhero genre, it skillfully juggled both effective comedy and brutally violent action scenes, plus it had some pretty convincing characters and a dark storyline. The sequel, on the other hand, fails at the juggling part. The action scenes are still pretty brutal and effective, but the humour lacks that razor sharp edge that made the first one so believable despite its premise. Instead it relies on racial stereotypes and potty humour, which just isn't that funny.Add in a lackluster storyline that honestly feels like watching tennis. First one character has a change of heart, then few minutes later he/she bounces back and another character decides to change his/her opinion, immediately after which the first one changes his/her stand. Rinse and repeat. A compelling and captivating story this does not make, especially when the villain generates mostly embarrassed facepalms and the final battle rejuvenates some of the first clichés the first film so artfully dodged.That being said, the production values are still excellent, some of the new characters are pretty interesting (though there's way too many of them), I still like both Kick-Ass (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Hit-Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) and they had some really good scenes together. If you liked the first film and want to see the storyline continued, this one is worth checking out if you're not expecting miracles.",Kick-Ass 2
52,freemantle_uk,The clash of costumed nutcases,7,16 August 2013,"The original Kick-Ass was a cult-hit back 2010 and DVD sales ensured the sequel was allowed to be made. But with Matthew Vaughn moving onto different products, so Never Back Down's Jeff Wadlow took over the reins and had to do adapt a graphic novel that was critical panned for its controversial contend.Two years after the events of Kick-Ass Dave Lizewski (Aaron Taylor- Johnson) wants to get back into the superhero game and starts to train with Mindy Macready/Hit-Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz). Dave as Kick-Ass soon teams up with other costumed vigilantes he has inspired and lead by ex- mob enforcer turned Born Again Christian Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey). But Hit-Girl does not want to return due to promise she made with her adopted father, Marcus (Morris Chestnut) to be a normal girl and deal with the school bitches. Even worst Chris D'Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), wants revenge against Kick-Ass and plans to become the world's first supervillian, The Mother-F**kerThe change in creative team is notable. Wadlow does a solid job with recreating the visual style of the first film but he is not as strong as Vaughn. The action is shot more closely and shaky was used, but it nowhere near the worst case of its use because you can still tell what is happening. The humour was not up to scratch with the sequel looking the satirical edge. Part of the problem is now that Moretz is older the impact of her swearing and fighting ability is a little lost.The other major problem is Kick-Ass 2's takes longer then it needs to set up the pieces and get going. The original is a longer film but felt more tout and tighter then the sequel. Kick-Ass 2 is more willing to take detours with subplots and The Mother-F**ker takes his time creating his army and try and draw out Kick-Ass. The whole subplot involving with Hit-Girl having to deal with the bitchy girls should have been reduced and the joke with the vomit/diarrhoea stick should have been cut all together because it was too crude, out of style and just unfunny.This time Mintz-Plasse is the highlight of the film: he has the best jokes, he has the best lines and delivery and he was just entertaining as the villain. He has presence on screen in his gimp suit and attempting to be evil. Carrey, Donald Faison and John Leguizamo were fine new addition to the series, particularly Carrey as the surprisingly hard vigilante who uses violence and acts as a good leader of the group. The best of the new cast was bodybuilder Olga Kurkulina who has obvious has physical presence, but also has menace with her few words and is a one woman army as she takes on a destroys a small army of cops.Moretz is of course a talented actress and she does her best with the material, but she is wasted with the mean girls storyline and it was actually triumphant when she is back in action. Taylor-Johnson too is solid, again and he works well with Moretz. But a plot hole that is never addressed is Hit-Girl is now 15 when in the first film she is 11 and Kick-Ass is a high school senior with his friends.The graphic novel Kick-Ass 2 is very controversial, featuring brutal violence for the sake of it and a gang rape sequence. Wadlow smartly cuts these elements, knowing they would not translate to film: the gang rape sequence was highly criticised by comic book fans and was only in the material for shock value.There has been a duel reaction to Kick-Ass 2, fanboys love the film and mainstream film critics hate it. Kick-Ass 2 is really in the middle of these two outcomes. It is a solid enough film that has some decent action and comedy, but it is not as fresh, well written or directed as the first film.6.5/10",Kick-Ass 2

Two things that I must mention, right off the bat; First thing is that I loved this movie and the second thing is that just because it is a comic book movie, it does not mean that it is suitable for kids, because it is definitely not. I saw several people with little kids in the theater that should not have brought them. Anyway, as far as the plot goes, Aaron returns as Kick-Ass, the vigilante hero that fights crime in his homemade costume. Chloe-Hit Girl-is working through her grief over the loss of her father from the first film and she is trying to lead a normal life in high school, but she finds it hard to do. She would rather slip out at night and fight crime, but she has a new parental guardian that objects to that kind of behavior. Christopher-Red Mist-is also working through grief, over his father, who was killed by Aaron with a bazooka in the first film. Christopher decides that the best way to honor his father is by becoming the world's first super-villain and even changes his name to Mother F#$&*@ to show how evil he is. Jim is one of the new heroes that join Aaron's crusade to fight for truth, justice and the American way. As I mentioned earlier, this is not for the smaller kids; during fights, heroes and villains get stabbed and even beheaded. The language is rough, remember Christopher's new name? And there is some nudity. These are all things that I personally like and have no problem with and I liked the way that they depicted a world where the consequences are shown of people trying to be a super hero, without having any real powers. Oh yeah, there is a scene after the credits, so be sure to stay for it. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and sexual content, including nudity, and has a running time of 1 hour & 43 minutes.

It is unlikely a place has existed on any planet in the Universe populated by as inept a government and law enforcement community as what these Canadians constantly try to foist off as a farce having some semblance to the United States. Maybe they would be better off trying to bamboozle their own people into believing crime pays so well, and cops are as easy to slaughter by the dozen as in KICK-ASS 2. Oh wait, maybe this is how things REALLY ARE in Canada! I must confess I haven't tried to get into Canada since the time the border guards stole all my goodies for their personal use. Adding insult to injury, the rest of my stuff got wet in the rain and I wasted three hours, since I never got to the movie I was crossing the border to see in the first place. I was out two bridge fares just for the sake of having my stuff stolen. None of the private businesses in Canada have gotten a nickel from me then or since, except for the bozos who continually trick me into seeing their sub-standard and misleading film fare.

Jim Carrey fills the void of Nicholas Cage with the meta-joke that they hire one of the most well known names in Hollywood to play a character that neither acts nor sounds nor even looks like Jim Carrey. The main characters are holding up well in their roles with some standout moments and some interesting character arcs.

Now the character of Kick Ass is always good and Chloe Moritz as Hitgirl is good when she is Hitgirl but one thing I didn't like in this film was the fact she was not Hitgirl enough and was in school which I don't really like. The MotherFer is a funny villain and really is a cartoon of villain but works for this film, however, this film is stolen by Jim Carrey as Colonel Stars and stripes he is awesome and is great in every scene he is in, but that is another negative the fact that he is not in the film enough for my liking. This film has a good narrative and story but lacked a bit of the comedy and style of the original plus some of the side heroes and villains aren't really that interesting.

57,estebangonzalez10,One of the most disappointing films of 2013,5,25 October 2013,"""I try to have fun. Otherwise, what's the point?""Let me begin by stating that I was a huge fan of the first film which ended up being one of my top ten movies of 2010. It was very entertaining and introduced me to Chloe Grace Moretz whom I absolutely love. My high expectations for this sequel were tampered down a bit due to the bad critical reception it received, but I still thought I was going to like it based on how much I loved these characters. However despite being entertained during several moments, I still felt this sequel was a huge disappointment due to the fact that it had serious issues with the overall tone of the film. It never quite captures the spirit of the first film which did manage to balance the ultra violent action scenes with funny moments. Here the sequel suffers from a lower quality script which never manages to be as witty as the first film. There were several scenes that felt forced and didn't work. One of the key differences with the first film is that director Matthew Vaughn turned in this sequel to Jeff Wadlow who doesn't have as much experience and isn't as good as a writer as Vaughn. Having got that out of the way, I still have to admit I had a fun time with Moretz's character and enjoyed her scenes as Hit Girl. She makes this film tolerable, despite the fact that they almost messed everything up when they tried to focus on her character's adaptation to High School. That was the weakest part of the film as Moretz was playing way out of character here and this felt like a bad version of Mean Girls at times. The jokes were predictable and forced in that scenario. When the film focused more on the action I thought the story improved a little, but there are too many weak moments in Kick Ass 2 for me to give it a passing grade. The film isn't for everyone, and unless you absolutely enjoyed the first one like I did, than I wouldn't recommend you this sequel. This sequel continues to follow Dave (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) as he has inspired several other ordinary people to become superheroes. Dave has been feeling a bit lonely and decides to ask Mindy (Chloe Grace Moretz) to team up with him as they continue defending the city. Mindy is reluctant at first, but she decides to team up with Kick-Ass and begins to train him. After an incident, Mindy who is now in the care of her foster parent, Detective Marcus (Morris Chestnut), is forced to abandon her vigilante dreams and try to live an ordinary life. She promises Marcus that she will stay away from the vigilante life and try to adapt to her normal life as a High School student. Being on his own once again, Dave decides to join forces with several of the superheroes he has inspired. Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey), a former gangster and now a born again Christian, has been leading a patrol group of masked crusaders known as Justice Forever, and they are glad to have Kick Ass join them. As things begin to go smoothly for these superheroes, a new villain shows up claiming to want to kill Kick-Ass. The villain is none other than Chris D'Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who wants to avenge his father's death. He has assembled a group of villains to destroy the city and begin terrorizing the members of Justice Forever. A final face off between them seems inevitable, and not all will survive.Other than Chloe Grace Moretz's character the rest seem to be underdeveloped. She is the only one carrying most of the film on her shoulders, but when the writers decide to strip her off of her uniform the film falls flat. It's those shifts of tonality that the film takes at times that end up burying this otherwise entertaining flick. The secondary characters don't do much here either, with the exception of Jim Carrey's Colonel Stars who gives a solid performance. He doesn't get enough screen time, but he stands out in the few scenes he's in. Nicolas Cage is really missed here as his performance in the first film was perhaps his last greatest one. He hasn't done much since. The film could have used a little more of Hit Girl and less of Mindy, but I agree with the fact that having a 15 year old vigilante isn't as shocking as it was when she was younger during the first film. I still enjoyed her performance and think she has a great future ahead of her (I loved her in Let the Right One In and Hugo as well). However I did find most of the villains really obnoxious here. They were another weak part of this sequel. Neither Christopher Mintz-Plasse nor Olga Kurkulina brought anything to the table and their characters were dumbed down. The film never quite finds its identity and at times it sends mixed and opposite messages about violence and society.",Kick-Ass 2

The problem with this sequel is that it was nowhere near as funny and that's the big difference. I think I probably laughed once or twice during this film throughout the entirety of its running time. Whereas I remember laughing regularly through the first film. There are other problems though in addition to the lack of laughs....One thing that really annoyed me about this film is the stupid coming of age sub plot involving Mindy Macready and the girls who were trying to recruit her as another clone - I get the point that was trying to be made, but was it really necessary? The heavy handed way it was delivered didn't help either. It didn't help that the girls themselves were really annoying and shallow. It may just be me, but I just felt that it was unnecessary in what should have been a fun comic book film.Another big gripe I had with this film is with Christopher Mintz-Plasse - he was kind of funny in the first film, but he was really annoying in this film almost to the point where his performance made the film unwatchable.Another notable low point in this film was the ridiculous way that Mother Russia takes care of the cops - it's almost embarrassingly stupid. I'm aware that it's a comic book film, but if you're going to go overboard with set pieces you should at least make them funny and at least slightly believable.The problem I had with this film is that it left me cold. It didn't have much heart to it and it wasn't particularly funny. The whole plot line is ridiculous as well - M********ker recruited a whole army to kill Kick Ass. With all his money, he could have just paid a hit-man to kill him. Problem solved.Chloe Grace Moretz and Aaron Taylor Johnson do redeem things slightly and seem to have good chemistry together - they make the film just about watchable.

Hit Girl had been forbidden by her strict guardian from being a superhero anymore. Now partner-less, Kick Ass joins a vigilante group of hero wannabes led by Captain Stars and Stripes. Red Mist becomes more insane, collects his own set of super villains and calls himself a name so filthy even his lieutenant cannot say it.Aaron Johnson does not really look like a teenager here anymore. He still acts more like a sidekick than a title character, and that may really be how it is. We get to see more interaction between his character Dave and his dad (Garrett M.

He was actually very good in this film, and his character is bad-ass. His relationship with his dad gets explored here a little more so there is a little more drama in his character than in the first movie.Christopher Mintz-Plasse is really crazy in this film, vicious yet hilarious as Chris D'Amico, madly wanting to avenge his father's death. I do not think it is easy to achieve that balance, so it is impressive. We see only a suggestion of what he can do in the first film, but he goes full blast in this one.Chloe Grace Moretz has certainly grown up to be one pretty lady in this film. She was indeed the star of the first film, and I'd say, she is still the star of this one. Despite having decreased fighting time, the screen lights up whenever she is there. Of course, she was spectacular not only in her fight scenes as Hit Girl, but also as Mindy Macready who was tormented by the mean girls at school.Being the sequel, we are not really surprised anymore as to what this franchise will give us. The fight scenes seem to be more graphic and bloody than the first. The seriously ultra-violent killing machine, the macho Mother Russia (Olga Kurkulina), made sure of that. However, the shock factor is clearly gone, and this sequel just goes through basically the same motions. But the entertainment value of the first film is still very much there.",Kick-Ass 2
61,jfgibson73,Liked it because of the characters,5,22 September 2013,"I liked Kick Ass 2. The characters were likable and interesting. I liked watching Jim Carey with the face prosthetic and accent. I like the Chris D'Amico character. I like the facial expressions that the main characters Dave is capable of--this actor could be a decent physical comedian. There were some good action sequences, the two main ones being Mother Russia destroying the cops, and Justice Forever breaking up the prostitution ring. The dark moments thankfully didn't go as far as in the comic, but the deaths and assaults on the heroic characters still had an impact. Best of all, I liked Hit Girl more this time around. I felt like she worked so much better as a 9th grader than an 11 year old. Her scenes were the ones I liked best, except when she made the girls sick in the lunch room. Her reasoning didn't make sense to me. She just came off as a bully. I thought it was a good choice when they humiliated her in the woods by just leaving her there. In another movie, the mean kids would try to do something else that involved putting their hands on the victim. But because Mindy would have destroyed every one of them, it was much more devastating to her that they all just laughed and walked away. The movie left me hoping there was a part three to see what happens with Dave and Mindy. I don't think it really deserved all the negative criticism.",Kick-Ass 2

Perhaps it is a little bit rushed and doesn't have enough time to establish the new characters properly, maybe it's the ending?I still liked it though, a lot. Superhero films are great fun to watch, with the exception of the latest Fantastic 4 and both Hulks, oh and I wasn't keen on Iron Man 2, this one however doesn't disappoint, it just doesn't have that wow and new factor that the first obviously did.I still love AT-J in the lead role and think it would be interesting to see a sequel made showing what happened years later if he was up for it. Did they get together? Did they change the world and make it a better place? Or did they just give rise to a new type of criminal who wants to defeat the good guys just for s**ts and giggles?The writing is good, the acting is good and the general direction, editing, etc is all fine. If you like hero films, you should like this one, it's just a bit more adult like the first.",Kick-Ass 2
63,Amari-Sali,"With an increase in violence, heroes, villains and repercussions, Kick Ass 2 tries to outdo itself whenever possible and seems to get the job done.",8,16 August 2013,"It has been three years since the first Kick Ass where we met Dave and Mindy who introduced us to Batman styled vigilantes, without the money backing. With this film, seemingly due to the heights Chloe Moretz obtained post-Kick Ass, we see her take a more central focus and Aaron Johnson' Dave almost plays the Robin to her Batman. Also, most of the original cast has returned, though many in diminished roles, and a slew of new characters have been introduced, including a character portrayed by the legendary Jim Carrey, all in order to take on Christopher Mintz's ""The Mother------.""Now, with this being a sequel, we already know most of the characters and I can't say anyone but Mindy has really evolved much. Dave remains Dave, a Peter Parker-esque guy who wants to make something out of himself; his friends are pretty much the same people we met; and then you have the group which encompasses Justice Forever and The Mother----- -'s crew. The most interesting character though, is Mindy. With the death of Big Daddy and her guardian now being Big Daddy's former partner Marcus, Mindy is given opportunity to become a 15 year old girl, which Marcus insists on her doing, but despite her biology being an unquestionable 15 year old girl, in her mind and heart: She is still Hit Girl.The story this time around, as alluded to at the end of Kick Ass, is all about Chris' revenge on Kick Ass for killing his dad, which no one seems to be as impassioned about. His mother doesn't seem to care; his bodyguard Javier (played by John Leguizamo) just does as told; and his uncle Ralph (played by Iain Glen) just wants to take back control of the family business and have everyone lay low. Chris can't do this though for revenge drives him and the thought of Kick Ass remaining alive, while his father is dead, is the ultimate injustice. So, he decides to follow in his father's footsteps and become a super-villain known as ""The Mother------."" Meanwhile, as one villain rises, one hero seems to fall. Mindy has maintained her duties as Hit Girl for as long as she can but a conflicting promise she made with Big Daddy and the new one she makes with her guardian Marcus has it where she has to discover who Mindy is outside of Hit Girl which leads to the awkwardness of Mindy discovering what it is like to be a 15 year old girl who has ""girlfriends,"" goes on dates, and gets weird feelings when seeing UnionJ or guys with their shirts off. Ultimately, the film all builds to the showdown shown in the trailer where the members of the Kick Ass inspired crew ""Justice Forever"" face off The Mother------'s crew and have a really exciting battle sequence.When it comes to this movie, one of the things you have to admire is the action and how the new characters introduced really get their own moments to shine. Jim Carrey's Colonel Stars and Stripes as well as most of Justice Forever, all within a few lines justify and make us understand why they wanna be heroes, and unlike in the last film where the rise of masked heroes seems like a joke, in this film these newborn heroes are really given nicely done origin stories which make them seem more complete than the hero known as Midget Man. Going back to the topic of the action, despite you thinking with online previews you saw just about everything, in fact you maybe just saw most of Hit Girl's action scene highlights which sometimes feel like they pale in comparison to Mother Russia's. Mother Russia (played by Olga Kurkulina) is probably the most interesting villain, in terms of what she physically does, I've seen in awhile, and I wouldn't be surprised if Kurkulina finds herself in similar roles and making a real career out of it. Lastly, I must mention how much I was glad they gave more focus to Mindy than Dave, if only because more and more Kick Ass is starting to seem like a powerless Peter Parker and Dave himself, throughout the whole movie, seemed so stale.Which leads to my criticisms: Dave/ Kick Ass is the type character/ hero who usually only have interesting stories because of the villains, but in this case he doesn't just get out-shined by the villains but also his allies. Another issue, which maybe just a personal one, is I think at this point that initial shock of the Kick Ass franchise has worn off. A teen-aged girl cursing like a sailor has lost its novelty, and really, while Mother Russia and the villains really did some not expected things when it came to the violence, like a grown woman having a full on fight with a 15 year old, I felt strangely adjusted to all that Kick Ass 2 threw at me. Watching a dog bite a man's testicles didn't bother me; seeing a man get his hand cut off was wasn't a big deal; and even when characters died, I didn't feel much. Which in itself was a general issue for I felt like the characters that do die, with the exception of one, aren't developed enough for us to really care. Yeah, we can acknowledge the significance of their death, but you easily shrug it off.Overall: Go See It Kick Ass 2 continues to delight fans of the first and show signs that it hasn't become jaded by the increased interest. It comes with more action, more characters, a bit more character development in some areas, and ultimately it tries to in every way outdo the first film. Set aside the issues with getting used to the violence and Mindy's character losing its shock and edge, much less the death of characters only really being sad once, and you got yourself a nice way to spend the afternoon or evening.",Kick-Ass 2

65,guisreis,The prequel is highly overrated. This sequel is a complete disaster!,2,4 February 2016,"This is a very bad film! Besides having all the drawbacks of its highly overrated prequel (it pretends to show common people becoming superheroes but indeed show hyper-violent and criminal child who fights better than Batman) it has much worse and absolutely unfunny jokes, a lot of prejudice (against Arabs, Asians, gays, women... and I am not talking about the racism of a character, like the M0therfvcker, but about the whole film), awful dialogs. I expected that at least Jim Carrey could save the day... but he did not. The plot itself is a disaster: Mindy cannot be a superhero because she promised to her father who made her a superhero that she would obey his friend who doesn't want her to be a superhero? That's nonsense. The way Ass- Kicker became a super villain was also so silly, so childish! As a matter of fact, super villains in this film are even worse than superheroes. Seeing the ""evil army"" reminded me the worse of comic book films from the 80's, without their qualities. All the parody of Watchmen (the picture on the wall, the outlawing of costumed vigilantes...) could be nice if the rest of the film were nice, but it isn't. I also think that, as the movie pretends that common young people are the heroes (15 years old Hit Girl shoots real guns!), they are really stimulating violence among teenagers in a very dangerous way. And what the hell was that absurd last quote?!",Kick-Ass 2

67,brando647,A Guilty Pleasure that Doesn't Kick as Strong as the First Movie,6,5 April 2014,"I'm just going to go ahead and file KICK-ASS 2 in the guilty pleasure category. I was a fan of the first movie and I was excited to hear they'd be shooting a sequel based on the second volume of the comic series from Mark Millar. Full disclosure: I've not read any of the comics and I'm only familiar with the characters from Matthew Vaughn's awesome 2010 film. It was disappointing that Vaughn moved on from the series and didn't direct the second film. The writing/directing duties fell to Jeff Wadlow, a man who's previous work is completely unfamiliar to me. Was KICK-ASS 2 as awesome as the first? No. Is it horrendous? Also no. It just sort of falls in that middle ground where it's fun enough while you're watching it the first time and you might even remember it fondly when it's over, but you may find yourself going back later and wondering what it was exactly that you enjoyed about it. The movie begins a few years following the events of KICK-ASS. New York has a new swarm of powerless, costumed superheroes on the streets eager to follow the lead of Kick-Ass. Dave Lizewski sees the influence his costumed alter ego has had on others and longs for the adventure again. Mindy Macready has been adopted by her father's best friend, Detective Marcus Williams, and he's done everything in his power to squash her life of crime-fighting under the guise of Hit Girl and encouraged her to live a normal high school life. When Mindy passes on the offer to join forces with Dave as a superhero duo, he finds what he's looking for in Justice Forever, an amateur superhero team. Meanwhile, Chris D'Amico continues to stew over the murder of his father at the hands of Kick-Ass in the previous film. He then has an evil epiphany: he'll become the world's first super-villain, assemble a team of his own, and exact his wrath on Kick-Ass and everything he loves.One problem that bothered me when I first saw the movie and I couldn't quite put my finger on until later viewings was that KICK-ASS 2 doesn't have that down-to-earth vibe of the first film. In the first movie, being a superhero had consequences. If you couldn't hold your own in a fight, you'd get beaten to a pulp and possibly killed. Dave witnesses this first-hand when he and Big Daddy were captured in the first film, beaten mercilessly, and Big Daddy was burned to death in front of his daughter. Pretty brutal. It was a lesson Dave learned the hard way. It seems the lesson was short-lived because the beginning of KICK-ASS 2 has Dave eager to return to the game and begging Mindy to join forces with him. When Marcus makes Mindy drop her life as Hit Girl and she makes an honest (short-lived) attempt at living a normal life, Dave never stops trying to drag her back in. Any respect for the real world consequences are totally forgotten for the film until Dave suffers his own personal loss. There are tragic repercussions for Dave in this film (not once but twice) but it doesn't really carry a lot of weight behind it. The real world pain of superhero life drowns in the background and KICK-ASS 2 spends more time glorifying the life and seemingly ignoring any themes established by the first film. As a result, the movie feels sort of shallow. It's just a big colorful, violent mess. But it's got its fun moments.The movie's got all of the candy-colored violence that made the first movie a visual treat but expanded exponentially. Instead of a few costumed vigilantes, we get armies of heroes and villains in makeshift comic costumes. I'll admit, it's cool to expand on the few from the first movie. In KICK-ASS 2, we've got Kick-Ass and Hit Girl, plus the heroes of Justice Forever: Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey, a total scene-stealer for the short time he's in the film), Insect Man, Remembering Tommy, Dr. Gravity, Night Bitch, and Battle Guy (Dave's friend Marty, played by Clark Duke). In a nice additional touch, each of these characters is given just a bit of back-story to individualize them. The same can't be said for Chris D'Amicosorry, the Motherf***erand his team of super-villains, the Toxic Mega-C**ts: the Tumor, Genghis Carnage, Black Death, and Mother Russia. Aside from Mother Russia being his muscle (and the only match of Hit Girl), the rest of his villains are interchangeable. The violence is nearly as brutal as the first film but it doesn't seem to have the same punch. I don't remember if the blood was CG in the first film but, if it was, it must not have been as bad because KICK-ASS 2 is loaded with CG blood spurts that just don't look right. The worst CG offender comes about halfway through the movie when Mindy's getting a little revenge with a new toy called a ""sick stic"". Her victim's struck with immediate, intense projectile vomiting and diarrhea, and the diarrhea looks like a low-budget cartoon. The scene was bad enough for stooping to cheap toilet humor for laughs but the horrible CG fecal fountain was just insulting.The movie has some flaws (why is Hit Girl near superhuman now?) but I can't say I wasn't entertained. It's still fun and there's some good stuff here. It's fun to watch Chloë Grace Moretz go into Hit Girl mode. Jim Carry's great as the born again Christian/former gangster, Colonel Stars and Stripes. The final battle between good and evil is insane. John Leguizamo's a cool addition as Chris D'Amico's ""Alfred"". I can't hate the movie. Fans of the first movie will find enough to enjoy in KICK-ASS 2 but I wouldn't hold out for a third part to the series at this rate. We can still hope for a killer conclusion, though.",Kick-Ass 2
68,zhyarTheChosen,Cool,8,9 September 2019,My fav character is kickass he has been improving I would love to see more sequels,Kick-Ass 2
69,Sergeant_Tibbs,Strictly for fans of the first.,6,31 August 2013,"Back in 2010, I really loved Kick-Ass. It was such a refreshing change of pace from the barrage of formulaic PG-13 superhero franchises. I do go back and forth on it a little, the first viewing it was a 9/10, then a few rewatches brought it to a 7/10 but now it's a solid 8/10. There was no need for a sequel even if it did set up one, but that seemed like an extra punchline more than anything. Now it seems to be changing into one of those watered down franchises. The trailers were dreadful and my expectations were at rock bottom, what more can they add to these characters? Well, not much, but I was pleasantly surprised for it to be perfectly average. It's relatively well-written, picking up where it left off in an expected but satisfying direction. It's a film strictly for big fans of the first though, it's almost like a 100 minute epilogue. It reminded me why I love the first so much. It's because it makes action scenes so emotional. Kick-Ass 2's best moments are ones that reminded me of its predecessor. Just like Big Daddy, it'll always live in its shadow.But that's fine, it could've been way worse. While I appreciate it for some of the genuinely surprising punches it pulls, it is incredibly guilty of the sexualization of adolescent girls and violence rather than commenting or challenging it. Perhaps Jim Carrey's views were in the right, though needless to say, his character here could've been played by anyone else. They shouldn't have spent half the budget on him as the technical department suffers severely. The cinematography is terribly mediocre. The editing is all over the place with angles not really cutting well together and the green screen segments are utterly unconvincing. But it was still fine for entertainment, just not nearly as slick as the first, which even had a slightly lower budget. I wish they didn't do high school drama with Hit-Girl but her return to action was so satisfying even though I initially thought she was overrated. I probably would've been better off reading the comic book sequel but whatever's quickest to digest.6/10",Kick-Ass 2
70,OJT,A good idea gone stray into a slutty gory childish mess,4,23 August 2013,"I liked the original ""Kick-Ass"" which was both a fresh idea and had a good portion of innocent fun and good humor. Sadly I have to say that the franchise can be announced dead and buried.The writer of ""Kick-Ass 2"" has completely misunderstood the idea behind the original film, and has written a sequel which has lots of troubles. It's lame, boring, violent, childish, bloody, gory, foul-mouthed, stupid and too long.It's a 4 out of 10 if you have some time to kill, and like stupid super hero movies, and nothing near the great idea of the first. I left the cinema after the last big fight. Then I had been bored for an hour. I'll still honor the idea behind the first, but already in the trailer we could see that this second outing had completely missed the mark, also when it comes to the humor. Watch the two trailers, and you'll easily see what I mean. I was expecting this to be nothing like the first, but I didn't expect it to be that bad.I rate it 4 out of 10 due to some of the charm in the main actors, and I still think the franchise has so amazing art work that you'd almost like to eat it.I actually really understand why Jim Carrey has refused to promote this film, after he saw the result. I originally though that sounded stupid, but oh boy was he right! This is how NOT to make a sequel!",Kick-Ass 2
71,MR_Heraclius,Not Bad,7,15 February 2020,"Kick Ass 2 isn't as refreshing or as original as the the first, but it still succeeds in delivering lights, entertaining action and a surprising amount of emotion.",Kick-Ass 2
72,Screen_Blitz,"Whereas its predecessor boasted an audacious rendition of the superhero genre, this one falls shallow on the rebellious spirit that made the first one a hit",6,19 August 2017,"Kick-Ass was a movie that both entertained and shocked audiences with its rebellious patent of taking the superhero genre and spinning into a raunchy hard-R satire with its unapolegetic delivery of ultra violence and subversive humor. It answered the witty question of why no one in real life every tried to be a superhero. Whether it or not it offended you with its morally reprehensible material (particularly from the violent and foul-mouthed Hit-Girl), it made for a wildly bold transcendence of its genre thanks to director Matthew Vaughn behind the wheel. It is sad to say that Vaughn didn't make his return to the director's chair for this sequel and is instead replaced by Jeff Wadlow whose previous effort was 'Never Back Down'. Upon watching this follow-up to the original, it seems like Wadlow may not have been the best replacement. Lacking the ironic flair and falling short of the anarchic comedic spirit that made the first film wildly entertaining, this film stands as a disappointing continuation of its predecessor. Set roughly three years after the events of the first film, Dave Lizewski (played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson) has left his life as the crime-fighting machine in favor of picking up on his high school life. That is not the same for Mindy MacCready (played by Chloe-Grace Moretz), now 15, who is still out in the streets suited up as Hit- Girl taking down the baddies. After getting caught sneaking out by her now-guardian Marcus (played by Morris Chestnut), she is forced to give up her life of crime-fighting and go to school as a normal teenage girl. Meanwhile, Dave decides to jump back into his superhero alter- ego and recruits a band of others superhero wannabes lead by Colonel Stars-and-Stripes (played by Jim Carrey). This leads them into a battle against the former Red Mist star Chris D'Amico (played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who adopts a new super villain alter-ego known as The Mother F@%#er, in attempt to seek revenge against Kick- Ass who killed his father in the last film. Matthew Vaughn brought a clever source of audacious meta-humor and an unyielding push for stylized violence and profane dialogue for the purpose of establishing a unique portrayal of the comic book genre to the original. That is what made the film vastly entertaining. Jeff Wadlow tries following his footsteps, but his attempt comes to subpar results. Whereas the violence and profane were wittily perpetrated to establish a slick comedic edge, Wadlow cuts slightly back on the edgy humor in favor of toothless sex jokes and attempts at bodily humor that almost never seem to land. And when it comes down to taking the character and setting them in the crime-fighting action, the results are less funny and fall inconsistent with some jarring tonal shifts and stabs at dark humor that occasionally get off-putting. While the action sequences following Kick-Ass and his buddies are fun and retain roughly the same amount of bloodshed displayed in the original, less time is spent with the last film's show-stealer Hit-Girl whose time on screen is reduced in favor of segments focusing on Mindy Macready exploring her life as a high school girl joining a clique of snobby school chicks, a subplot that not only feels overly derivative from 'Mean Girls', but hinders the pacing of the plot . Thus, the majority of the show is handed to Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Kick-Ass who, while likable, lacks the level of charisma to Chloe Grace Moretz's Hit- Girl; while a large portion to handed to Christopher Mintz-Plasse's supervillain ego whose evil demeanor feels often too vicious and over-the-top to even contribute to the darkly funny atmosphere. Jim Carrey's Colonel Star-and-Stripes, a role the actor now detests due to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting months prior, is no show stealer here; though shines with a little twinkle of charm. In the end, it is fair to say Jeff Wadlow succeeds at making the film self-aware of itself while breathing a few nice action scenes to engage in the adrenaline- fueled testosterone, even if his style of humor falls short of Matthew Vaughn's comedic beauty. Kick-Ass 2 is a moderately entertaining sequel that may boast a sense of excitement in terms of feeding audiences with its energetic action muscle, but falls shallow to the bold humor and subversiveness that ravaged the beauty of its predecessor. It comes to show that more often than not, it follow-up signals a step down from the franchise. But could the return of Matthew Vaughn helped? It is certain.",Kick-Ass 2
73,Troy_Campbell,Silly but fun.,7,25 August 2013,"Wondering if Kick-Ass 2 is for you? The title alone should tell you everything you need to know, however your appreciation of the excellent first instalment is probably the best indicator. Downgrading director Matthew Vaughn and scribe Jane Goldman for the dual-hatted Jeff Wadlow, this sequel at times struggles to shake its cut-price foundations yet remains on the amusing side of dumb. The shock factor from the original has dissipated but that doesn't stop Wadlow from piling on the politically incorrect gags and savage bloodshed. One particular set piece involving a freakishly muscular Russian woman - aka Mother Russia - annihilating a swathe of fumbling cops without remorse is simultaneously the epitome of bad taste and yet gloriously entertaining. Chloe Grace Moretz hogs the spotlight again as the potty-mouthed, uber-violent Hit-Girl, whilst Aaron Taylor-Johnson is serviceable as the largely sidelined eponymous vigilante, Jim Carrey is gripping in a criminally small role, and Christopher Mintz- Plasse is deliriously petty as the spoilt-rich-kid-turned-villain known as the Mother Fu... well you get the point.

77,brchthethird,A somewhat disappointing sequel,6,14 November 2014,"While this is an entertaining movie, it's somewhat sub-par as a sequel because it tries to juggle too many things, and because of tonal inconsistency. In short, the plot revolves around Kick-Ass growing into his new-found role as a real-life superhero, with the help of Mindy/Hit-Girl. However, she gets caught by her new guardian Marcus (an underused Morris Chestnut), essentially putting her Hit-Girl days behind her. Here, the story splits as part of it follows Mindy as she adjusts to high school life, and Dave as he joins up with a superhero team called Justice Forever, led by Colonel Stars and Stripes (an underused Jim Carrey). Together they take on the Motherf***er/Chris d'Amico and his new team of supervillains. Among the things the film does right is logically proceeding from where the first film left off, in an attempt to keep things as ""realistic"" as possible. What doesn't work this time, however, is a mix between ultra-violence and black humor, and some emotional moments that feel out of place. It's tonally jarring, and none of them are ever quite earned. This movie also suffers from another common sequel problem, which is trying to do too much. While the Mindy-at-high-school subplot did feel organic to what the narrative was trying to accomplish, it never really gelled with the overall story and made the movie feel kind of disjointed at times. There were also too many supporting characters, and none of them really got the proper attention paid to them. Still, the epic battle royale at the end was worth seeing, if only for the simultaneous fights between Hit-Girl/Mother Russia and the Motherf***er/Kick-Ass. As far as the action sequences went they were OK, but nothing too special in how they were staged or shot, although they were edited rather well and comprehensible. Special effects were also satisfactory, although some sequences looked better than others. It is a comic book movie, though, so they did go for the ""over the top"" look. Overall, it fails to live up to the promise of the first movie, but it's entertaining in it's own right.",Kick-Ass 2
78,Joxerlives,Good but lacks the satisfying conclusion of the first film,7,20 December 2013,"Really liked this, a lot of fun had by all and hugely entertaining. A little disappointing in the ending if I'm honest, one of my favourite aspects of the first film was the conclusion where it was implied that Mindy would at last be able to enjoy a happy childhood as an ordinary girl at school and no longer have to kill or be killed as Hitgirl. We find out that actually she didn't embrace normal life and continues her father's legacy even though she accepts that he was insane. If they do get to make a third film I would like her to finally get a truly happy ending once and for all. Also a little disappointed that Dave breaks up with his girlfriend from the first film, it was such an arduous task for him to get her in the first place that to ditch her with just one throwaway scene seems an awful waste, I'd have loved to have seen a relationship develop between her and Mindy. Aside from that there is an awful lot to enjoy here. The scene where Mindy and the mean girls get whipped into an adolescent frenzy whilst watching a Union-J video had me almost crying with laughter, so uncomfortable to watch and yet utterly hilarious. It's interesting because we've seen it so many times with male teenage characters in Porky's/American Pie etc and here we see it for the first time with girls, they're actually no different. Their date-ditch scene is horrible to watch (more so than all the violence actually) and Hitgirl's revenge with the Sickstick is truly disgusting. The fights are good although you wonder why Hitgirl doesn't use the glass shards or her thigh knives to stab Mother Russia before she gets jabbed with the adrenaline syringe?My favourite aspect is the burgeoning relationship between Dave and Mindy, the little hints of intimacy and attraction, her obvious delight at having a friend and training partner again to replace Big Daddy and her jealousy when she realises he's shacked up with 'Night Bitch'. Love to see where this might lead. So, they've very blatantly left the door open for number 3 and I'd love to see it.",Kick-Ass 2
79,drjgardner,From super hero to super letdown,2,17 August 2013,"I was a big fan of first ""Kick Ass"", largely as a result of ""Hit Girl"" (Chloe Moretz), the 11 year old who did those incredible action sequences. The incongruity of a little girl doing such outrageous stunts was a great surprise. But now she's grown and it's not so funny anymore, and 24 year old Aaron Taylor-Johnson who plays ""Kick Ass"" looks more like a pedophile rather than a high schooler, so the whole tenure of the film changes. The villain, Chris Mintz-Plasse, isn't much of a villain either, so the whole story is hardly worth viewing.There are some amusing bits, and Jim Carrey is always a treat, but fans of the original are going to be disappointed.",Kick-Ass 2

82,khanbaliq2,Kick-Ass 2 is thrilling and well-paced. More time with Hit-Girl guaranteed.,7,27 August 2013,"When Kick-Ass (2010) was released I wrote a favorable review about it. The film has originality. The casting, acting, action, comedy and soundtrack are the upside. On the downside it's uneven and problematic in balancing reality and fantasy. Kick-Ass 2 isn't as original but it gets everything else right. It's an upbeat film that's entertaining from beginning to end. There's still some gore and foul language but the film never makes you think that it should get back to the good stuff. One of the reasons for this is that a lot more time is spent on showing what's happening with Hit-Girl. What the franchise needed was more Hit-Girl and Kick-Ass 2 delivers. The film is also very funny. But don't think that the filmmakers took it easy this time around. There's still plenty of exciting, well-choreographed action. At times there's some very effective drama. The stakes are higher too as Chris D'Amico becomes the super villain The M*********r and uses his wealth to assemble a gang of super villains. Christopher Mintz-Plasse really entertains as The M*********r, and he's fantastic as the main villain. Bodybuilder Olga Kurkulina also impresses as Mother Russia. There's some good work from Jim Carrey, and he managed to create a memorable character in Colonel Stars and Stripes. The star of the film, however, is Chloe Grace Moretz as Hit-Girl. She's still in her teens but she's been captivating in almost all of her roles. In an interview she said that she loves her acting job and, judging by her performances, I guess she really does. The film is based on Mark Millar's two comic books Kick-Ass 2 and Hit-Girl. Kick-Ass 2 wasn't directed by Matthew Vaughn. He was one of the producers this time. Jeff Wadlow (Cry_Wolf, Never Back Down) directed the film. This isn't a problem because the film is still a home run. It's a terrific summer movie and I certainly recommend it.",Kick-Ass 2
83,natashabowiepinky,Bash! Smash! Thrash! Crash!,7,23 August 2013,"Come on, admit it... the stars of this movie are Crash Test Dummies in disguise. They receive punishment that no-one could possibly recover from... yet five minutes later, act as though they've nothing more serious than a splinter. Even taking into account this is based on a comic book, it takes a very high suspension of disbelief to see a teenage girl beaten to within an inch of her life... then one injection of adrenaline later suddenly she's moving faster than the unwanted lovechild of Speedy Gonzales and Road Runner. Do the Olympics committee know about this?The young lady in question is called Hit Girl, and never has a superhero monicker been more apt. She's around five foot tall, but can take out roomfuls of armed men within seconds. I wouldn't like to be the one telling her she's failed her exams. Played by the brilliant Chloë Grace Moretz, she remains the best thing in this series. Not to say the rest of the cast are slacking, the majority of whom return from the first movie. The pastiche of comics is priceless, with more in-jokes and homages than you could get in just one viewing.But it's all about the fight scenes, and it is my pleasure to report that they are more graphic and brutal than ever before. Anyone who doesn't get a sense of exhilaration by seeing a lawnmower thrown through a windscreen chopping up the occupants, or witnessing someone get stabbed by a hundred shards of glass at once must officially be dead. Or just appalled, in which case this is the wrong movie for you. Go rewatch Annie, or something. The rest of us can enjoy a classic of chaotic violence, just don't try any of this at home... 7/10",Kick-Ass 2
84,Anurag-Shetty,"Not as funny as the first but, an entertaining sequel.",8,28 August 2013,"Kick-Ass 2 continues with the story of high school geek turned superhero, Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass(Aaron Taylor-Johnson). After Mindy Macready/Hit-Girl(Chloe Grace Moretz) decides to quit crime fighting & opt for a normal life, Kick-Ass joins Justice Forever, a group of superheroes who have been inspired by Kick-Ass to fight crime in costume. This group consists of Colonel Stars and Stripes(Jim Carrey), Dr. Gravity(Donald Faison), Insect Man(Robert Emms), Night Bitch(Lindy Booth) & Marty/Battle Guy(Clark Duke). Meanwhile, Chris D'Amico/The Motherf**ker(Christopher Mintz-Plasse) starts assembling an evil army with the help of his assistant, Javier(John Leguizamo) to get his revenge on Kick-Ass. I would like to start by saying, I really liked this film. The action sequences were brilliantly executed just like in the original. However, the humor takes a backseat. Though there are some scenes that are hilarious, it's not constantly funny like the first film. The poop & puke scenes were really gross & not in the least bit funny. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is great as Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass. Chloe Grace Moretz shines yet again as foul mouthed teenager, Mindy Macready/Hit-Girl. Moretz is the highlight of the film, once again. This time, we see more of Mindy than Hit-Girl. It was nice to see how Mindy fits into the big bad world of high school. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is brilliant as Chris D'Amico/The Motherf**ker. Jim Carrey is hysterical as Colonel Stars and Stripes. The supporting characters are impressive as well. All in all, if you were a fan of the first film then, Kick-Ass 2 is a must watch.",Kick-Ass 2
85,bryank-04844,This is a great sequel and delivers what the fans want on every level.,7,23 August 2015,"Mark Millar's ultra-violent superhero story is back in 'Kick-Ass 2′. If you can believe it, this highly entertaining sequel amps everything up to eleven. From the characters to the story and especially the violence, everything gets revved up, bloodied, and kicked into high gear.While first film centered around Dave, a.k.a. Kick-Ass (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), as he suited up in costume to fight crime, the sequel puts more focus on Mindy Macready, a.k.a. Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), who's better at everything – from fighting to weapons to trash talking – even though she's several years younger. Mindy hangs up her cowl for a little bit and tries to lead a normal life in high-school. After being tormented by the bitchy popular girls in school, as you can imagine, Hit Girl exacts a revenge so thick and sweet that you could pour it over hot pancakes.A little while has passed since the first movie. With the success of Kick-Ass as a hero, others have been inspired to take up crime-fighting in costume as well. Kick- Ass teams up with a group known as Justice Forever, led by Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey), a former Mafia goon turned good. This rag-tag group sets out to stop gangsters, rapists and pedophiles.Meanwhile, Chris D'Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) is still angry about Kick-Ass killing his dad. Hell-bent on becoming the baddest super-villain around, he drops the name Red Mist and starts calling himself ""The Motherf****r."" He also and enlists a string of bad dudes from around the world to take out Kick-Ass and everyone he loves. While the Motherf****r garners laughs, his mission is X-rated as he rapes, murders and destroys everything in his path.Jeff Wadlow replaces Matthew Vaughn as director this time around. By not letting Hit Girl upstage anybody else with her fighting skills for a good portion of the film, we get the opportunity to see the other heroes take down criminals. However, every time Hit Girl isn't on screen fighting, we wish she was.Jim Carrey is almost unrecognizable in this and delivers a great performance as the leader of Justice Forever. Mintz-Plasse brings the funny, while Moretz and Johnson reprise their roles perfectly. A cameo by Donald Faison deserves his own spin-off movie.This is a great sequel and delivers what the fans want on every level. Be sure to stick around for the end credit scene.",Kick-Ass 2
86,Geeky Randy,Geeky Randy's summary,4,8 September 2014,"When life gets boring for former crime-fighter Kick-Ass (Taylor-Johnson), his ex-companion Hit-Girl (Moretz) trains him on how to be a proper hero; while D'Amico (Mintz-Plasse) adopts a new villainous title. Although this installment received more negative reviews than its predecessor, it's not any worse in quality it's just not as overrated. Gets moving real quickly, and never runs into a dull moment. Fatal flaw: the audience is taken out of the story too often with the characters' insistence and reminders that the plot is supposed to be grounded in reality. Jim Carrey is far less theatrical than you'd expect, but he still brings his charm nonetheless.** (out of four)",Kick-Ass 2
87,Christian_Dimartino,It works for the first hour. And then...,5,18 August 2013,"A few months prior to the release of Kick Ass 2, Jim Carrey, who plays an aspiring vigilante named Colonel Stars and Stripes, said that he would not help promote Kick Ass 2 because of its violence. As a fan of the original, I figured he wasn't kidding. But after seeing Kick Ass 2, I have realized that the reason to avoid it is not just because of its violence (and it is very violent). But because the last 40 minutes takes a very wrong turn.The film picks up what seems like right after where the original left off. We find Kick Ass (Aaron Johnson) and Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz, the highlight of this one and its predecessor) in High school, trying to finish what they started and fight crime and stuff. Kick Ass teams up with a group of wannabe superheroes, led by Colonel Stars and Stripes. Meanwhile, Chris D'amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who just can't be taken seriously) has his heart set on murdering Kick Ass.The original was an over-the-top bloodbath, but I got a kick out of it, because it is really unlike anything ever. The sequel works for the first hour, but it takes a dark turn. A turn for the worst. The film has some hilarious moments, but yet sometimes it goes too far, even for a sequel for Kick Ass. It is very violent.But one of the main flaw is the turning point. Once the actual story kicks in, the movie just can't find its footing. The original also took a dark turn, but it ended up kicking ass in the end. And obviously this one does that too, but I just don't like what writer/director Jeff Wadlow did with it. For the first hour, I was trying to figure out what was wrong with it. Then, it hit me. It hit me in the heart. This movie messed with my soul. That was a mistake.Which leads me to the biggest flaw. This movie also happens to be a waste of a Jim Carrey performance. As a lifelong fan, I wanted a lot more from him. They simply just don't give him a lot to do. I was expecting him to be the highlight of the movie. Keep in mind, there are a few golden moments here, but they don't come from Carrey. Instead they come from Moretz, who, along with Nicolas Cage of all people, made the first one what it was. She is terrific again, but at the end of the day, Kick Ass 2 is a missed opportunity. This is the biggest disappointment of the summer.C+",Kick-Ass 2
88,MattyGibbs,Excellent sequel,7,27 August 2013,First off i'd say this isn't as good as the original but it's still a fine effort. It's basically more of the same humour and violence. If you didn't like Kick Ass you probably won't like this either. The three leads are back Aaron Taylor-Johnson (kick ass) Chloe Grace Moretz (hit girl) and Christopher Mintz-Plasse (red mist /motherfucker). They are joined by a new band of heroes who to be fair don't add a lot to the plot. I was disappointed with Jim Carrey's character and the rest are nothing special. This is more than made up for by the three leads who all put in great performances and there is good support from Morris Chestnut as hit girls adopted dad and Garret M Brown as kick ass's dad. Some of the toilet humour does not work for me but the laughs come thick and fast and a lot do hit the mark. The sporadic violence and fight scenes are handled well and the plot isn't afraid to veer from what you are expecting. The ending was a bit weak for me but this is still a film I really enjoyed and will doubtless watch many more times in the future.,Kick-Ass 2
89,0w0,More 'adult comic-book hero' fun,7,22 October 2019,"It's not a kids movie, let's get that out of the way... This movie is meant for adults and actually fills a very small niche in the ""adult comic-book heroes"" catagory... There's plenty of movies that have ""comic-book heroes"" but they are ALL rated GA or TA... but Kick-Ass 1/2 are rated MA, and that's what makes the film unique. The ONLY other ""comic-book heroes"" movie aimed at adults that comes to mind is Super (2010) (which is very good btw).So here's the facts: Kick-Ass 1/2 fills a void which previously was only filled by Super (2010), and Kick-Ass 1/2 is actually a pretty good movie too. It's not the best movie on earth, but it scratches an itch which literally only 1 other movie before it has done... and that makes Kick-Ass 1/2 very valuable.",Kick-Ass 2
90,asda-man,Kicked arse again!,8,22 September 2013,"I remember seeing the TV spots and what not for Kick-Ass when it first came out and thinking, ""That looks like total rubbish."" It seemed to show really strained un-funny jokes and it looked like it was made for comic book geeks only. However, after winning Kick-Ass on DVD from an offer on a pack of Stella Artois (classy drinker) I gave it a look. To my surprise I found myself loving every minute of it. It was full of fun with hilarious moments, thrillingly directed action sequences and memorable characters. What I liked about Kick-Ass was that it showed a ""real"" superhero. He's just a boy that can be easily broken. It seemed more realistic than most superhero films, despite it's over-the-top violence and characters. It didn't have the stark realism of The Dark Knight trilogy or Super, but it did have an insane amount of entertainment value. Could the sequel deliver the same quality? Almost.When I saw ""almost"" I don't mean that this is a massive decline in quality, it's just that Kick-Ass was a tough act to follow, however Kick-Ass 2 does follow it nicely. It's not as memorably directed, but it does importantly have that sense of fun and entertainment. I struggle to understand the largely negative reviews that the film was getting when it was released, because the film I saw was fast, thrilling, funny and very entertaining. It's the type of film which you're sorry to see end because you just have such a ball watching the wonderful action and characters. It's also very funny, as the middle-aged woman in the front row who was laughing her arse off, would agree with.A lot of people were banging on about how shaky the camera is during the fight scenes. I was fearing the worse (think The Expendables and The A-Team remake) however, it's really nothing to worry about. The action scenes are directed better than most. They are shaky, but they're controlled and not edited manically so you can see what's going on. Yes, it's not as well directed as the first, but it could've been a lot worse. There are still some wonderful action scenes to cherish in this. I especially enjoyed the all-action finale which featured a rather large battle between the goodies and the baddies which I won't spoil.Kick-Ass 2 manages to balance the action with good character development too, so we remain interested in their journey. I actually quite liked the spoof chick-flick element where Hit Girl decides to throw in the costume and pursue a ""normal"" life. These parts were always interesting and consistently humorous. The film actually does very well with balancing the characters' stories. We've got Kick-Ass himself who has joined a group of people led by an unusually un-annoying Jim Carrey and also the old Red Mist is trying to pursue a career as a super villain. Each character story is interesting and entertaining to watch. It also moves at a very brisk pace, which suits the film well, although I did feel that it did skim over a few important (and sometimes shocking) moments that deserved to be dwelled on a little more. However, this isn't too much of a problem.Kick-Ass 2 also introduces some wonderful new characters. My favourite being Mother Russia who is seriously hard-as-nails and also a very memorable character. All the new characters were able to offer something fresh and funny into the film, so it doesn't feel like it's just a re-tread of the first film. Needless to say I enjoyed Kick-Ass 2 immensely. It's the type of film you're sorry to see end because it's just so outrageously entertaining. What's nice about Kick-Ass is that it isn't trying to re-invent the superhero genre, it's just trying to make it fun, which is refreshing to see with countless superhero films that try and be as moody and serious as The Dark Knight but just end up looking self important. It's a fun violent blast from start to finish and a film I shall look forward to seeing again.",Kick-Ass 2
91,billygoat1071,A Big Sequel,7,16 August 2013,"Kick-Ass has defined itself as a superhero movie with heroes wearing silly costumes and little girls brutally beating up tough grown men. That piece of creativity has been appealed by many for smartly satirizing the genre, despite of some absurdity still existing and glorified in the action scenes. For that hype three years ago, here comes the sequel that still got the good old charms of its predecessor. The bigger difference now is the theme they are supposed to present seems tougher, but the action has also gotten strangely out of hand. While those upgraded elements can be a bit uneven, it's not really hard to enjoy the overall film since it's still quite hilarious and utterly entertaining. Although it only has little sincerity in its own message, there's no denying that Kick-Ass 2 is a lot of fun.Kick-Ass 2 is somewhat like any sequel, it heightens the scale to look even more exciting than the first one. Other than that, the rest is mostly the same. As usual, the most entertaining parts are having fun with the characters and some superhero satires. Even if it takes a different direction, the tone surprisingly sticks to the picture which is a joy. Everything is just enjoyable and amusing, but we all know that these movies are more than being fun. It always takes some darker themes so it can come close to reality. The film suddenly becomes intriguing when it discusses about the consequences of being involved in crime fighting, but those elements didn't stray far enough.The better surprise you're gonna see here is the performance of Chloë Moretz. She already stole the show in the first film, but here she has grown her Mindy Macready into a much mature character than just a simple violent crass as Hit-Girl is, and as Hit-Girl she is still pretty awesome. Aaron Johnson is charming as always as Kick-Ass. Jim Carrey is also delightful as Colonel Stars and Stripes. The villains are kind of caricatures, but the one who played their leader, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, brings both wimpy and menace to keep him from being too sinister.Noticeably, the style of the last director was more inspired than the new one's. Though, the aesthetics are intact. What people might brag about is how preposterous the action scenes are. I understand it's supposed to be tongue-in-cheek and faithful to the illustrations of the graphic novel, but the fact that they're trying to avoid these heroes and villains from being ""Super"", it seems they can't help to justify that and make it all incredibly badass anyway. Besides, everyone is only interested about how violent it is. I just wish it has more of those anti-hero parts to make it feel human. Otherwise, people will cheer on how awesome these set pieces are, because it's inevitable to call them awesome.The ones who will likely enjoy Kick-Ass 2 more are the fans. It's almost too identical. Same entertainment quality, same amount of laughs, and got ironically ridiculous action scenes(from jetpack to lawnmower); while we get an impressive performance from Chloë Grace Moretz and a story that has potential of being compelling. It has the same pros and cons, but bigger. Although bigger, I think the original has smarter execution. I guess the film wants to focus more on its coolness than the morality and humanity it suggests. In other way, Kick-Ass 2 is good enough as a blockbuster and a competent sequel.",Kick-Ass 2
92,dilipbts,Kick-ass 2,7,22 July 2020,"I loved the first one and have been waiting for this with great anticipation! When I saw it on Comcast On-Demand I immediately rented it. Like most sequels, this wasn't as good as the first and it's hard not to make comparisons to the first movie.The first thing I noticed was the lack of a good soundtrack that went with the first movie. Scenes like Hit-Girl whooping ass to Joan Jett's ""Bad Reputation"", or the old Banana Splits song ""Tra La La"" Song totally made the first one awesome for me. The soundtrack was as important as the characters.As the movie was unfolding I kept waiting for some funny/rocking music to play. Unfortunately, I was pretty let down that they didn't spend the money to acquire some interesting/funny/rocking songs for this movie.Then the plot was sort of handicapped by the fact the characters had matured. I felt the actors all did a good job, but the built in humor that came along with an innocent naive Kick-Ass character getting his butt beat, or the irony of a 10 year old foul mouthed girl killing someone with the same zeal she would pursue a boy band with was gone.I think they spent a little to much time developing the idea of a group of super hero's and and not enough time developing Kick-Ass & Hit-Girl characters. Overall, I liked it, and I'm sure most will... It just wasn't as fresh and new as the original.",Kick-Ass 2
93,TheSquiss,"Sufficient slap, bang, wallop for an evening's entertainment.",6,16 August 2013,"Kick-Ass (2010) was mad, bad, violent and all kinds of wrong. And it rocked! Kick-Ass 2 does the usual sequel trick of trying to repeat the magic, upping the ante and falling short. Occasionally a sequel matches or even improves on the original (The Empire Strikes Back, Wrath of Khan) but it's a rare occurrence. And so the unfortunate tradition continues here.Perhaps an indication that the magic might dim a little was the announcement that the golden team of director Mathew Vaughn & writer Jane Goldman had been replaced by Jeff Wadlow on double duties. But, though Kick-Ass 2 fails to ignite the audience in the same way its predecessor had us leaping out of the auditorium and assaulting inanimate objects all the way home, it has sufficient slap, bang, wallop to make the two-hour investment worthwhile.Inspired by amateur superhero Kick-Ass' (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) antics, the streets have been filled by geeks, vigilantes and inept do-gooders squeezed, poured and plonked into ridiculous costumes and sporting monikers ranging from the dark (Night Bitch) to the absurd (Insect Man). Reeling from the slight case of death his dad suffered at the hands of Kick-Ass, Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) rebrands himself The Mother F%&*^r and sets about recruiting violent foot soldiers to help him exact revenge and become the biggest badass on the street.Kick-Ass turns to Hit Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) to join him in Justice Forever, a new group of masked crusaders led by Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey), to end The Mother F%&*^r's war on society but she has issues of her own to contend with, namely fitting in at school and appeasing her guardian, Detective Marcus Williams (Morris Chestnut).Kick-Ass 2 takes far too long to start rolling and the action of shuffling bums in seats is more attention grabbing than (the lack of) action upon the screen. When the story really kicks in and the limbs finally start flying, however, it becomes a fun, violent and at times funny romp.The stars, Moretz, Taylor-Johnson and Mintz-Plasse are on very familiar territory and edge towards character development, with Mintz-Plasse hamming up the pseudo-Bond villain delightfully. There's nothing surprising or particularly new from any of them, save The Mother F%&*^r's outrageous costume but they are familiar companions on the screen for us to enjoy nonetheless.Much has been written about Carrey's apparent conversion to pacifism since shooting Kick-Ass 2. I'm not sure quite how he went from playing a character who relishes the aggression of his vigilantism to cardigan-wearing critic of all things violent, but thank goodness his road-to-Damascus turnabout occurred after the film wrapped. I'm far from a fan of the rubber man's work (The Truman Show being the exception) but he's on fantastic form here. Rather than the standard over the top pantomime display we usually endure, his Colonel is a darker, more grounded performance that suggests Carrey's best work may still be ahead of him. There are a few notable cameos that bring colour to Kick-Ass 2, particularly Lindy Booth's sexy Night Bitch and her complete opposite, Olga Kurkulina as Mother Russia, but this is a film of freaks on a mass scale. The colours are dazzling and costume designer Sammy Sheldon must have been a kid in sweet shop here.There are some fun touches, particularly the vomit stick sequences, and sufficient action to consign the early dullness to distant memory, and the morning after it feels as though I must have had more fun than I felt I was having at the time. But given the choice, I'd still turn to the original more often than the sequel as, fun though it was, Wadlow's offering is not so much Kick-Ass as Bum-Slap.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",Kick-Ass 2
94,RevRonster,Not as good as the first but still great...,8,3 December 2013,"""Kick-Ass"" or this follow up isn't for everyone. With its hyper-violence, inappropriate language and this sequel's villain who has a name that IMDb won't allow me to put in this review, it's easy to see why this comic adaptation can cause quite a stirand the reality is the comic book is even more depraved. But that's why I liked the first one and why I enjoyed this one.Everything I loved about the last film is here again (and it's the stuff that I said offends most people) and the addition of new characters only helped keep the film fresh and new. Plus, it's pretty cool to see what they adapted from the comics for this one. Even thought he condemned the film, I still thought Jim Carrey was great in his role and, once again, I thought Christopher Mintz-Plasse was fantastic as Chris D'Amicoaka the character I can't actually type into my review.While this story tends to get much darker than the first film (and even darker in the comics), the film is still a slick, ultra-cool comic adaptation that really feels like it leapt off the pages thanks to great directing Jeff Wadlow and the creators of the source material hitting up the writing department.Hi!

95,dfle3,Hit-Girl the evil person slayer. 77.5%,8,22 August 2013,"I have to confess to once again seeing one of these films with some reluctance. For the first movie, the hurdle I had to overcome was just the naffness of the premise...a child superhero? Fortunately, thanks to some mentions of and perhaps clips of Hit-Girl in the movie, I took the plunge the first time around. Chloë Moretz won me over that time with a captivating, improbable performance. If I have one regret it's that a sequel didn't immediately follow suit...because there was something wonderfully absurd about that little tyke taking on the big guys and...kicking their arses! This time my reluctance was due to thinking that maybe Chloë was just too old for this role...Hell, if Hit-Girl is a big girl now, why not go the whole hog and get Meryl Streep to play her? For 'gravitas', of course! Does Hit-Girl have charm if she's now a big girl? Well, yes.""Kick-Ass 2"" plays like the TV series ""Buffy the vampire slayer""...a story of a little girl who is on the cusp of womanhood and...has to fight extraordinary villains. It's much better than the original ""Buffy"" movie and I liked it as much as the usually good episodes of the TV series ""Buffy"". If you liked the ""Buffy"" mix of teenage girl dramas and...kickboxing, this will definitely impress. ""Kick-Ass 2"" had a few laugh out loud moments for me too, as well as some of the disconcerting scenes found in the first movie. As for the comparison with the ""Buffy"" series, that falls down as far as the sidekicks go. Whilst Hit-Girl is more engaging and charismatic than Buffy, my favourite part of that TV series was the warmth, charm and wit of her high school friends Xan and Willow...something which this movie lacks.In the original movie, I was taken out of the movie by wondering how appropriate it was for a little girl like Chloë to be (implicitly) sexually menaced in one scene as Hit-Girl. This time around I suppose I was feeling awkward at the prospect of Chloë having to bump and grind in a cheerleading tryout in the sequel (showing that Chloë is still a young actress for me...or perhaps it's just her petiteness). There was one other scene concerning a threat of rape which I thought skated close to the edge but I went with it...people could get all PC about that scene, I think.Perhaps more of a surprise to me than Chloë still getting away with playing Hit-Girl was that it was the other characters who I felt were too old. The titular character seemed too old now to be attending high school...perhaps not so out of place as John Travolta in all singing, all dancing mode, but still...(I should also note that Aaron Taylor-Johnson's age also made his final seen in the movie with Chloë seem perhaps a bit creepy...I could imagine that scene being refused classification in the 1950s, say! The taunts that his real world identity got about his relationship with Chloë's Mindy also seemed 'edgy', but perhaps not out of place in a high school context.) Kudos to Aaron in any case for his powerfully emotional scene near the end of the movie. Also, Claudia Lee as Brooke (perhaps a 'Cordelia' type, from the ""Buffy"" series) seemed too old for her role too...but, just having Googled her, her age is about right! So, not exactly Olivia Newton-John wrong...but she just seems older in the film...so it wasn't too uncomfortable watching her bump and grind her cheerleading moves.Some old faces return for the sequel...I enjoyed Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Chris D'Amico and...Mo'fo'(again with the ""Buffy"" comparison but he does remind me of those nerdy villains in that series, known as ""The trio""...just Googled them...I didn't actually remember that!). Some faces seemed familiar...Lindy Booth's character (""Night Bitch"") reminded me of that Goth lab geek in the N.C.I.S. series, I think (a series that I never saw, mind) and Morris Chestnut as Mindy's 'guardian' (!) reminded me of, perhaps, that guy in the ""Buffy"" series...not sure if he was though. There's a lot of new characters in this movie in any case, and some of them have a Mad Max 2 vibe or are similarly memorable, like the character of Mother Russia.Recently a star of the movie, Jim Carrey (as a superhero) came out against the violence this movie. For a lot of the movie I couldn't really see what his problem was, but eventually the violence kicks up a notch...but not really enough for me to get all PC about. In fact, I thought that Chloë gave a much more mature take on the movie in today's (22/08/2013) interview in the Herald Sun newspaper. It was also disappointing that recently Ke$ha recently disowned her good pop hit ""Die young""...for me, in both cases, it's a case of ""Really?"". I.e. I don't think that real world violence like these two celebrities are referencing (a massacre of primary school children in Sandy Hook) can be causally linked to violent movies or songs with lyrics like ""Die young"" should be read as bringing to mind such violence...it's just a figure of speech! Sheesh! Anyway, I enjoyed the recognisable Carrey's turn as a surprisingly buff looking superhero.There seems to be scope for a sequel to this movie but going on the box office results, maybe that's in doubt now. No doubt that ""Kick-Ass 2"" is still better than most conventional superhero movies. There are some positive messages in it too for young people but I think that the people that would most benefit (children) aren't really old enough to see movies like this.This is an enjoyable movie with some laughs...so long as you aren't too precious about the conventions of superhero movies, which this movie both mocks and celebrates. Hell, I might even be onboard for another in this series! That's not something I could say about most blockbuster Hollywood superhero movies.",Kick-Ass 2
96,SkullScreamerReturns,Half-Ass,4,28 December 2019,"When I watched the first Kick-Ass I was expecting something terrible but it turned out to be very cool. But this sequel answers to my original fear scenario. It's bland and boring, and the action-packed spirit that made the first one so good is absent.Some characters died in the first movie, but here we have a lot of new characters of which some are interesting and some are not. Everything about this movie is somehow mediocre. There's more drama than kicking ass, and yet the story is not very interesting. I watched it just yesterday and I find it hard to describe what's the plot. The bad guy just hangs in his hideout and says how bad he wants to be and the good guys sit in their hideout planning to do something. The only interesting thing is that the protagonist and the antagonist have both killed each other's fathers, so that could build an interesting conflict but even that element isn't really developed into anything.Not a terrible movie but unlike the surprise-good first part this one falls into the endless lake of mediocre superhero flicks. Superhero enthuasiasts are safe to watch it but for casual action movie fans I say skip it.",Kick-Ass 2

Dave/Kick-Ass and Mindy/Hit Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) are about to graduate high school and become a crime-fighting duo when their noble plans are foiled by Mindy's strict parents. Now, as Mindy hangs up her Hit Girl uniform and navigates the treacherous high- school social scene, Kick-Ass begins patrolling the streets with Justice Forever, a fearless group of urban watchdogs fronted by former mob thug Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey). They've got the criminal element on the run when Chris D'Amico lays his Red Mist persona to rest, and reemerges as The Mother F**ker, a powerful criminal mastermind with a loyal legion of henchmen. The Mother F**ker is determined to avenge the death of his late father, who previously perished at the hands of Kick-Ass and Hit Girl.

99,socrates99,I enjoyed this movie and find the critics out of line,8,19 August 2013,"Why there's an uproar about this film's violence is beyond me. This is the same audience that thinks nothing of blowing away children in the middle east on a regular basis. Our country is heavily invested in weapons of extreme violence that in real life make this movie look like an episode of Sesame Street.This is just a movie, an exercise in fantasy that will please you and make you marvel a bit. I found the 2 leads engaging if a little quirky. They had to be given the diverse group they're associated with. And anyway, you suspect the director pulled back a bit as I have no idea why the gay 'superhero' is called insect man, for example. Night Bitch was my favorite. She's a bit of a slut but no one minds.Probably my favorite scenes were in the high school where crazy Brooke, queen of the high school, triggers all sorts of memories. The cruelty is pretty much a fair portrayal of what really happens daily. For that, I've got to believe Claudia Lee is going to be a priceless addition to the Hollywood firmament as her performance is spot on and truly unforgettable.I wouldn't keep a kid from seeing this but I would understand why many would as there is a lot of swearing and a lot of talk about sex that might be a bit premature. But any adult should be able to have fun with this.",Kick-Ass 2
100,LloydBayer,A Fans-only Costume Party,6,7 September 2013,"Even with the script offering much of the same fare, KICK-ASS 2 is darker and goes further than the preceding original. Adding on to the premise that an average Joe can become a superhero without actual super powers, Mark Miller's graphic novel is cranked up beyond that which made the first film a fun action-comedy. This includes balls-out action, new characters that end in ultra-violent death scenes and an insane level of profanity.After his crime-boss father (Mark Strong) was blown up with a bazooka, Christopher Mintz-Plasse's 'Red Mist' upgrades himself to a super villain and even calls himself 'The MotherFu**er'. His mission in this sequel is to avenge his father's death by killing 'Kick-Ass' (Aaron Taylor-Johnson returning as Dave Lizewski). Meanwhile, Dave joins a nocturnal group of superhero wannabes led by 'Colonel Stars and Stripes' (Jim Carrey), a former mobster who commands his side-kick dog in German. Mindy (Chloë Grace Moretz) is forced to hang up her 'Hit-Girl' costume by reluctantly tuning into the highs and lows of normal teenage life. But just like the first movie, Mindy proves to be your atypical high school freshmen, resulting in an action filled finale that becomes a battle-royale costume party. Don't ask me how, but Mindy still has all those cool weapons and gadgets although her father 'Big Daddy' (Nicholas Cage) was brutally murdered in the first movie.Single-handedly carrying the weight of this sequel, Moretz stands out again, and is perhaps the only silver lining in this unwanted mess. There are scenes where she switches from cute to deadly in the blink of an eye, and one particular scene caught my attention as an interesting pun to her upcoming and anticipated horror remake – CARRIE. So much so, Moretz side lines Taylor-Johnson who just happens to be the titular lead. In fact, Taylor-Johnson brings nothing new to this sequel except beefing up his costume to look like a ninja turtle. There are also new characters, albeit derogatorily named, that are placed as either side-kicks or henchmen, but none of these characters are remotely entertaining except Carrey's Colonel Stars and Stripes. As we have seen before, it takes little effort for Carrey to either have you giggling in delight or grimacing in disgust. And depending on your taste for humor, Mintz-Plasse's precariously named super villain has some gags in store but only because his character is written-off as an imbecile.In its entirety, this charade of a sequel loses its edge by indulging in over-the-top absurdity, crass one-liners and under-the-belt gags, all of which are in the same league as the similarly themed SUPER. And if you really want to measure how miniscule this movie is, try watching it after a re-run of Zach Snyder's WATCHMEN, an epic that is also an incomparable masterpiece. With previous director Matthew Vaughn bumped up from director to producer, KICK-ASS 2 was all but on a silver platter for new director Jeff Wadlow. Instead, this sequel turns out to be a cash-grab that is too violent for a comedy, too absurd for its action and just plain ludicrous on a whole.",Kick-Ass 2
101,p-jonsson,"Action-filled, violent, vulgar and very very silly",5,29 December 2013,"The first Kick Ass movie was a fresh idea and I quite liked that movie. Unfortunately this one seems to have be the creation of someone that believes that a good movie can be made by stacking extreme silliness and vulgarities on top of each other until you reach about a 100 minutes or so.Most of the movie is unbelievably silly. The original movie also had plenty of silly moments but they were more there to support the plot and not to build the movie as in this one. The main villain is so contrived and stupid that he is just not funny.The so called ""superheroes"" are equally ridiculous. The costumes are just awful. Sure, they are supposed to be amateurs but still The entire movie is pretty much shouldered by Hit-Girl who is the only one who is not absolutely ridiculous. Without her this movie would have been a total turkey. Unfortunately the vulgarity seeking script writer managed to put her up in a overdone and very disgusting puking scene that really dragged down the movie.The scenes with Hit-Girl in them, except the above mentioned one, and the action scenes are where almost all the enjoyment of the movie lies. The rest is either so silly or so disgusting that it is barely watchable.",Kick-Ass 2

The film is full of crap and it is even, at times, a messy and vulgar dud full of misogynistic, racist and sexist stereotypes.

104,jcbutthead86,"A Brilliant, Action-Packed,Hilarious Superhero Sequel.",10,16 August 2013,"Kick-Ass 2 is a brilliant,Action-packed and hilarious sequel to the original Kick-Ass that's filled with great direction,a wonderful cast,amazing Action and funny Comedy. if you loved the first Kick-Ass you will love this sequel.Set three years after the first film,Kick-Ass 2 finds teenage vigilante Superheros Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass(Aaron Taylor-Johnson)and Mindy MaCready/Hit-Girl(Chloe Grace Mortez)putting on their costumes and be crime fighters against Supervillain Chris D'Amico(Christopher Mintz-Plaase)who now calls himself The MotherF***** forming a gang of Supervillains and wants revenge against Kick-Ass after the events of the first film. With nowhere to turn Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl team with a group of other vigilantes named Justice Forever who are being led by Superhero Colonel Stars and Stripes(Jim Carrey)and aim to take down The MotherF***** and his Supervillains.The original Kick-Ass,despite a little controversy was a success at the Box Office and Home Video while also becoming a Cult Classic meaning that a sequel was bound to happen and along comes Kick-Ass 2. Kick-Ass 2 is an Action-Packed,hilarious and entertaining sequel that takes the things that worked in the first film brings it with this film. Doing a sequel to a film that was loved by many people isn't easy but Kick-Ass 2 is a great movie that lives up to the original and matches it's energy and insane hilarity and if you have seen the first Kick-Ass you know what you are in store for with Kick-Ass 2. Kick-Ass 2 is a movie that is filled with non stop Action,great laughs and amazing,thrilling entertainment from start to finish and is a film that has the same no holds barred attitude that worked in the original Kick-Ass while also giving audiences fantastic fun that they will never forget. One of the things that I like about KA2 is the way things have changed where right after Kick-Ass became a vigilante other people such as the group Justice Forever were inspired to become costumed Superheros and protect the city as well and the way Justice Forever dress and act is so funny and will have you in stitches because one vigilante is more bizarre than the other and you never know whether to take the good guy vigilantes seriously or laugh at them for what they are trying to do because like Kick-Ass Justice Forever believes in what they're doing even though they are risking their lives. The Comedy and laughs in the film are great and are filled with dialog and insane situations that can be weird and offbeat,vulgar and offensive but at the same time done in perfect timing and never missing a beat. The Action in the film is exciting and stylish and truly matches the surreal and over the top quality of the first film and each Action scene is done with dark humor that is memorable and imaginative. The film's two main characters Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl are once again great and unforgettable and have wonderful story lines in this film. Where as in the first film Dave and Mindy were both wearing costumes and saving lives as their alter egos in KA2 both Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl have taken different paths. Dave still continues to be Kick-Ass despite the violence and danger and seems to learn how to fight better in this film(although Kick-Ass is still a little rough around the edges)and has more help from Justice Forever and the situations Kick-Ass has with Justice Forever is hilarious and over the top While Kick-Ass continues to be a Superhero and fighting with other crime fighters Mindy has to try and live a normal life as a teenager,a life that is far different from costumes and Superheros and being Hit-Girl try to fit in with other Teenagers but it's not easy for Mindy because being Hit-Girl is all that she knows. Watching Mindy trying fit in with other teenagers as well as other teens girls is funny and interesting because while Mindy doesn't know other High school girls the high school girls really don't know Mindy and who she really is and if they mess with Mindy they will pay. The villain Chris D'Amico/The MotherF***** is so wild and funny that you never know what The MF is going to do next whether it's trying to get revenge on Kick-Ass or forming a group of violent Super villains to satisfy his taste for vengeance. Where in the first film D'Amico was the fake Superhero Red Mist,in KA2 D'Amico is The MF a super villain that is crazy and someways like Kick-Ass except evil and a little bit in over his head. The screenplay by writer-director Jeff Wadlow is wonderful and filled with great dialog that is funny and quotable and is done in such a stylish and memorable way and makes each of main characters unforgettable and fun. The ending of KA2 is amazing and filled with great Action and non-stop excitement that will have you glued to the screen and there is also a big surprise after the end credits that you won't see coming. A great conclusion.The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Aaron Taylor-Johnson(Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass)and Chloe Grace Mortez(Mindy Macready/Hit-Girl)are excellent and funny once again in their lead roles. Christopher Mintz Plasse is wonderful and laugh out loud funny as Super villain Chris D'Amico/The MotherF*****. Jim Carrey is fantastic and hilarious as Colonial Stars And Stripes,leader of Justice Forever.The direction by Jeff Wadlow is excellent and stylish,with Wadlow always moving the camera and gives the film a great visual style while also doing a terrific job with the Action and fight scenes. Wonderful direction,Jeff.The score by Henry Jackman and Matthew Margeson is wonderful,intense and light and greatly matches the tone of the film. Great score by Jackman and Margeson.In final word,if you loved the original Kick-Ass or love Superhero films or Comic Book movies,I highly suggest you see Kick-Ass 2,a brilliant,Action-packed and truly hilarious sequel that lives up to the first film. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Kick-Ass 2
105,TheHonestCritic,"Does this sequel make lightning strike twice? Or, is it a letdown? Check out my review to find out!",10,14 March 2021,"""Kick-Ass 2"" (2013), after the unexpected surprise of the first film, I was thinking how they could possibly top it with this sequel. Plus, when I found out that Jeff Wadlow was going to be directing it, that also lowered my hope for it to be good. But, I watched it any way, and I found myself really enjoying it all the way through from beginning to end! I was invested, excited and laughing throughout the whole film. This movie has a great story, stellar acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also an excellent soundtrack to tie it all together. Once again, this movie is based off the comic of the same name. This time, the story is, Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass is trying to improve his fighting skills, by training with Mindy Macready/Hit-Girl. Meanwhile, Chris D'Amico has accidentally killed his own mother. Now that his mother is dead, he is in full control of his late father's criminal empire. He exacts revenge on Kick-Ass by becoming a villain named, The Motherf**ker. Yes, that's the actual name of the character. He forms a team of villains called, the Toxic Mega C*nts. Yep, that's the real name of that villainous team. With Dave's training being successful, he and Mindy form a superhero team called, Justice Forever. From then on out, it's non-stop action, excitement and laughs. In this film, the stakes are even higher and it also has it's fair share of emotional moments as well. It has everything you could ever want in a perfect sequel! As for the acting, it's just as fantastic as in the first movie. Plus, we have a few new characters introduced this time. All of the new actors and actresses really nail their respectable characters just as well as the main cast and side characters! Their performances definitely bring this film to life. All of the sets/locations are perfect and really give the film an excellent atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, they are perfect and still hold up to this day. Which is not surprising, being made in 2013! Finally, the soundtrack composed by Henry Jackman and Matthew Margeson is top-notch. Their film score sets the perfect tone and it brings the whole movie together. ""Kick-Ass 2"" is a phenomenal sequel and a worthy follow up to the first film. It's not quite as good as the first movie is, but, it's still 100% worth watching more than once. Especially if you love the first movie! I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen this film, or the first one, go see them today. But, make sure that you watch the first one before you watch this one, it'll make it that much more enjoyable. If you don't see it, then Justice Forever will track you down!",Kick-Ass 2
106,adi_2002,A sequel even more disgusting then the first movie,1,15 June 2014,"I honestly hated the first film and I didn't have many expectations from this second one, in fact the only hope I had has accomplished, the fact that this is much worse. For a film that promotes violence among kids and shows graphic content my vote can't be higher that one. The idea is the same but the scenario is changed, now a superhero is advised to quit her hidden life and act like a normal girl for her age while her partner seeks someone to fight along him and restore justice. Red Mist accidentally kills her own mother and with the help of her employee searches powerful villains from around the world to destroy his enemies.Please avoid this movie at all costs, don't let your children watch it, not even for a minute and if that so called director wants to make the world a better place, he should let him be hit by a car just like in his movie.",Kick-Ass 2
107,dallasryan,Not Bad but...,6,7 October 2014,"Some truly great films I see, I'm not sure what I think of them at the time during and right after I've watched them. It takes it's time to settle in my system whether that be days, weeks, months or years, but when it does settle in my system I end up liking the film a lot better in the long run rather than during the time of watching it or right after watching the film. However, with Kick-Ass 2,the opposite is the truth here. I liked Kick-Ass 2 during the time and right after the viewing of it. I liked it a lot, but then the film kind of settled into my system after a day or 2, and I didn't quite like it as much as I initially did.Kick-Ass 2 is entertaining, the characters are fun, and I would have loved to have seen more of Jim Carrey's character, Col. Stars and Stripes. Jim Carrey is fantastic in the part of Col. Stars and Stripes and the film is worth seeing just for his performance alone.Overall though, the film falls a bit flat(as sequels tend to do). Kick-Ass 2 doesn't have the same magic as the first one. The story isn't as good nor is it as well written as the first, and so it just falls flat in the end. But still worth the watch for Carrey's performance.",Kick-Ass 2
108,fcabanski,Worse Than Bad,3,6 January 2017,"The most heroic aspect of this movie is the heroic effort it took to sit through the whole thing.Kick Ass was half a good movie. It started strong, then petered out at the half way point. But even the bad second half of that movie was better than any part of this sequel.The movie tries hard to be funny, but it isn't funny.A promise to a father's friend takes precedence over a promise to a father. What? Hit Girl breaks the promise to her father, to keep fighting crime, to make a promise to generic cop father's friend guy. At least she goes back to keeping the promise to Big Daddy.The movie set up a conflict between mf'er and his uncle, but it never paid off on that conflict.The movie set something up with Kick Ass' upgraded costume, but never paid off on that. Kick Ass can barely hold his own in a fight with Chris, MF'er, shown to be a complete wimp throughout the movie.I used super speed for this one - often fast forwarding through parts of it so I could get to the end faster.I thought the end fight was going to be good. But it wasn't.",Kick-Ass 2
109,darkreignn,"As fun, entertaining, and comedic as the first",9,30 March 2021,"""Kick-Ass 2"" was stacked against seemingly impossible odds - with the surprise hit of its 2010 predecessor, audiences seemed more willing to expect the failure of the sequel than they were its potential success. But, there was some buzz: The cast inclusion of Jim Carrey garnered positive word-of-mouth, as did the return of fan favorites Aaron Taylor-Johnson as the titular Kick-Ass, and Chloë Grace Moretz as Hit Girl. At the least, fans seemed to be willing to give this movie a chance. And then the Sandy Hook school shooting happened. Jim Carrey renounced his support of the film citing its high level of violence too disturbing, especially after the Sandy Hook tragedy. And whether it was just a case of being at the wrong place, in the wrong time, or perhaps audiences shared Carrey's mentality and likewise didn't want to watch a movie that contained a lot of violence, ""Kick-Ass 2"" underperformed at the box office, and received tepid reviews from audiences and critics alike. But is it really as bad as its reputation would have you believe?I found myself shocked at how much I was actively enjoying the film, especially since I refrained from re-watching it for years after its original release date because I remembered not enjoying it. Overall, the film is just as comedic, fun, and action-packed as the original movie, filled to the brim with witty, crude dialogue, ridiculous scenarios, and overly stylized violence. It has the characters we want to see, in the situations we want to see them in - Hit Girl is as funny and charming as always, Kick-Ass is more confident in his abilities and more fervent in his desire to protect the city, and Jim Carrey's Colonel Stars and Stripes is an absolute show stealer with an unmatched level of endlessly watchable charisma. It's true, ""Kick-Ass 2"" isn't as good as the first film, but it misses that mark by a slight margin.The film follows our favorite characters as they face off against a new band of super villains, formed by Christopher Mintz-Plasse. Still vexed over the murder of his father, Christopher's Chris D'Amico seeks revenge against Kick-Ass, and will stop at nothing to get it. I enjoyed watching his depiction of a wannabe super villain, especially because he more so wants to be evil than he actually is evil. It's fascinating, and humorous, watching him act in ways in which he thinks a super villain should act, and it does make for a slightly sympathetic character in some ways. Additionally, Kick-Ass and Hit Girl have chemistry that's off the charts, and it's so good that I almost wish there was a slight romantic subplot between them (and perhaps there is? You have to watch to find out). They're so charming and sweet to watch on screen together, and watching them kick ass and violently beat down criminals is never not entertaining.The movie also explores Hit Girl's experience as a high school student - to say she is outside of her element would be an understatement. The film takes a ""Mean Girls"" approach, as Hit Girl befriends a group of the popular girls, and obviously crude, and cruel, antics await. It's an interesting dynamic to watch a girl raised to murder try to acclimate to such a normal environment, but it does make for some funny scenes, especially as she is starting to awaken in herself a romantic interest in boys. Kick-Ass himself tries to give up the suit, but finds himself unable to, and instead joins the super hero collective Justice Forever, led by Colonel Stars and Stripes. This leads to some incredibly badass action scenes, where Jim Carrey gets ample time to shine, as well as some humorous interactions between Kick-Ass and other members of the group.For a large majority of the time, ""Kick-Ass 2"" was a total blast, and I was shocked that it received the negative reception it did. The humor, the action, the characters, it's all here, and it's all awesome. But then, I did start to notice some cracks. There are moments in this movie that do go too far in terms of gross-out humor. I never found poop or vomit jokes funny, but ""Kick-Ass 2"" goes full throttle in this regard, and I just found it more unnecessary than anything else. Additionally, the film has character moments that don't quite make sense. For example, Kick-Ass and one of his other friends are inexplicably rude to the third friend in their group - while it's normal for men who are friends with each other to crack jokes at each others expense, they are at times so rude that it's shocking, especially when they do not treat each other this poorly in the previous film. Additionally, Kick-Ass himself freaks out at his father, saying things so cruel that it would've been more appropriate for the film's villain to utter them. Again, this comes out of nowhere, and is unprecedented, as previously, and in the first film, Kick-Ass treats his father with nothing but respect.Also, the larger scope of the story leads to more moments that are unbelievable - yes, I know the first film had Kick-Ass blow someone up with a bazooka, but it occurred at the very end of the film, and felt earned and built up to. In ""Kick-Ass 2,"" there are many scenes that feel included just for the sake of inclusion - for example, the infamous ""sick-stick"" sequence, or a set piece where a villain by the name of Mother Russia goes on a killing spree and murders a bunch of police officers. While this scene did show how brutal Mother Russia was, I found it pretty uncomfortable, especially since the music played during this scene was upbeat, almost as if the scene was supposed to be entertaining.All-in-all, however, ""Kick-Ass 2"" is relentlessly entertaining, and just a shade below the first film in terms of quality. Nothing can match the visual style, high-energy, and dark comedy of the first movie, but ""Kick-Ass 2"" comes close. If you're at all a fan of the first ""Kick-Ass,"" I firmly believe that you'll have a good time with this.",Kick-Ass 2
110,Jerghal,Can't be all,7,5 November 2013,"Did Kick-Ass really need a sequel? Apparently some studio people thought there was some more money to be made so here it is. KA2 is not as streamlined or focused as KA1. Besides real-life superheros it also has a lot of other themes like being popular at high-school, obeying your parents, falling in love etc...Sometimes it's really hard to see what this film is trying to be: you have scenes that might be intended as comedy but aren't funny (the music always seems overly dramatic), emotional scenes that are very cheesy (intentionally?) and gratuitous bloody violence à la Kill Bill. The film was made for a low 28m$ but the VFX sometimes look fake and cheap, the physical fight scenes are pretty good. I have to say that I have mixed feelings about this one: on one hand I found it enjoyable to watch but on the other hand it does feel like it could have been a lot better and it didn't need to be made. The pubic seems to agree as it made only half the money of the first one so this is probably the end of the line. If you have seen and liked the first one, I would give it a go.",Kick-Ass 2
111,martinrobertson300482,Pretty God damn entertaining,7,25 October 2013,"""Kick-ass 2"" seems to have taken a bit of a beating from most critics, but I (Being a mere cinema goer) found it to be more or less to the same standards of the first film. With plenty of funny moments as well as stylishly brutal ones.Some of the violence may be harder to stomach this time around, as the whole film seems more in your face, and does go a bit over board in some scenes. But its another dark comedy, which has enough laughs, and more action this time to get by. Besides, if you've seen number one, they had to push the boundaries a bit more with this one, otherwise it would just be a mere re-hash of it? No? Christopher Mintz-plasse and Jim Carrey (Who also turned against the over the top violence of the movie) are the stand-outs, adding something new to what we've seen before of Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Chloe Grace-Moretz. Despite some un-necessary moments the movie is pretty God damn entertaining. Though judged against a lot of the other movies I've seen this year, it wouldn't be hard to call something ""The best thing I've seen in the last couple of months.""",Kick-Ass 2
112,bazmitch23,"I liked it, but the first movie is way better",7,21 January 2014,"THINGS I LIKED:-I liked that there was more superheroes and super-villains in this. I loved the battle between the superheroes and super-villains at the end. Chris starting to become a super-villain. He tries to be all bad ass, but he's crap at it. -Jim Carrey has fun as the Colonel, who was my favourite character. But he's not as good as Big Daddy. It's also nice for Jim to play against type. He doesn't overact as much in this.-Mother Russia was a cool character. The scene where she takes out the police by putting a lawn mower on the back of the police car, reverses and it goes through the windscreen of the other car and kills the police men I thought was creative.-Another creative scene is when we see the Triad guys are talking in Chinese and instead of subtitles, it's speech bubbles. -I thought the scene where Justice Forever rescue the hookers was sweet.-The fight between Hit-Girl and Mother Russia.-The message at the end that you don't need to dress up as a superhero to be a hero.-The Jessie J song in the credits was lethal. Her voice is always amazing. Coincidentally, Hit-Girl's wig is based on Jessie J's wig.THINGS I HATED-It's not as strong as the first film.-There are some jokes I thought were lame like when Todd asks Dave and Marty ""Did you guys see Spider-man last night? Is it weird that Aunt May gets me kinda hard?"" and Marty replies ""Not if you're a granny slammer."" How is that funny? Also, when Chris and Javiar are sorting out Chris' mum's stuff out and we hear Javiar say ""Damn, she had a nice pair of guns."" Chris says ""Dude, she's dead. Don't talk about her tits."" and Javiar comes into the room with actual guns saying ""I'm talking about these."" That joke was predictable.-Showing a girl crapping herself? I know it's Kick-Ass, but does anybody wanna go to the cinema to see a girl crap herself? Me neither. -The relationship between Dave and Katie ends of a sudden. In the comics, Katie is an absolute bitch and in the first film she's nice. There were trying to bring her bitchy personality into this film and it didn't work.-The green screen shots were Mindy was on top of the van looked fake.Overall, I had fun with Kick-Ass 2. Now roll on Kick-Ass 3.",Kick-Ass 2
113,gregeichelberger,Another pointless sequel gets ass kicked,2,31 August 2013,"Let's face it, the sheer existence of the numeral ""2″ behind any film title automatically relegates said picture to the garbage heap of cinematic experiences (see ""The Hangover Part 2"" and ""The Smurfs 2"" as recent examples).Of course, there are rare exceptions where the sequel is better than or as good as the first, such as ""The Godfather: Part 2,"" or ""Superman II,"" or ""Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan,"" but usually second installments are quickly made to cash in on a surprise hit and capture lightening in a bottle.This is no exception when it comes to ""Kick-Ass 2,"" which continues the story of a group of amateur wannabe super heroes from the graphic novel of the same name.Three years ago, with ""Kick-Ass,"" director Matthew Vaughn filled theater seats with young bodies eager to see peers don capes and costumes and sock it to the baddies. The biggest attraction, however, was then 12-year old Chloë Grace Moretz (""Dark Shadows""), who personified the title as ""Hit Girl"" and dealt serious damage to men three times her age and size.And while I was not a fan of this endeavor, nor did I think it was funny to have the little girl have a filthy mouth to go along with her deadly martial arts talent (us fathers of preteen daughters are funny that way), I judged the movie slightly acceptable because of its original story and the exuberance of the young actors involved.Now, however, with everyone three years older, the freshness of the script long-gone, and a new director, Jeff Wadlow (""Never Back Down""), calling the shots, Kick-Ass 2 becomes just another in a long series of stale and unnecessary sequels to movies which did not deserve sequels in the first place.And while seeing a 12-year old girl wreak havoc may be interesting to some of us, viewing the same kid as a 15-year old doing the same thing just does not mean that much anymore.To be fair, though, I will try to describe the plot as best I can. After bringing down the local villains in the first picture, Kick-Ass/Dave Lizewski (Aaron Taylor-Johnson, ""Savages"") has laid off and gotten soft, but the son of the main bad guy killed in part one, Chris D'Amico/Red Mist/The Mother F***** (Christopher Mintz-Plasse, ""This Is the End"") has not forgotten and puts together a group of super baddies to gain revenge and control the city again.To counter this, Ass assembles his own group, the Justice League, uh oops, I mean the Justice Forever group with some of the lamest characters ever put together for a superhero film: ""Colonel Stars & Stripes"" (Jim Carrey in his 142nd consecutive terrible role), ""Dr. Gravity"" (Donald Faison, TV series ""Scrubs""), ""Night Bitch"" (Lindy Booth, ""Nobel Son"") and the ridiculously-named ""Battle Guy"" (the lame Clark Duke, ""Hot Tub Time Machine"").Needless to say, the violence here is way over-the-top, the acting is well below what one would expect from such a production and the direction is practically non-existent.Ironically, the only thing worth seeing here is Moretz again, who while dishing out her own brand of ludicrous force, is still, the best actor out of everyone, including the embarrassing, cringe-inducing Carrey, who even came out before ""Kick-Ass 2"" debuted to blast it for its matter-of-fact depiction of gore. No doubt he accepted whatever pay he was offered for participating in such stupidity, though.",Kick-Ass 2
114,mistoppi,Screen writing is tacky,5,8 January 2017,"I remember when this movie came out, I loved it so much. I like these movies because there's no way things would go well for anyone who decided to just become a superhero. These movies are violent, brutal and emotionally so rough. But now that I've seen this movie too many times, I notice how tacky the screen writing is. Especially during those scenes where Mindy clashes with the popular high school girls. Girls can be mean, but you wouldn't know that listening to these girls talk. Still fight scenes are fun, character designs are amazing, and there's something in Kick-Ass movies that just couldn't be done in typical DC or Marvel movies, some kind of irony that could never work in Avengers. Of course Deadpool comes close, but Deadpool's not a typical Marvel movie, is it?",Kick-Ass 2
115,Bruce722,Not as good as the first but still worth watching.,7,20 August 2013,"Kick-Ass 2 is a very good movie but it fails to capture the essence of the first film. The first movie was successful for two main reasons. For one, the brutality and in-your-face factor was incredibly high and created a certain ""shock and awe"" that left a lasting impression on the audience. The second was the film's refreshing take on the superhero concept. Both of these elements were either lost or severely diminished in this sequel. To cover the shock and awe, it just didn't have it. There were nowhere near as many scenes that made your peel away and get engaged at the same time. I think a big reason for this was the diminished role of Hit Girl. That's not to say that Chloe Grace Moretz' character, Mindy Macready, doesn't get appropriate screen time. If anything, the opposite is true. At times it almost felt as though she was the main character and the driving force of the film. The problem is that Mindy Macready, though Moretz is a fantastic young actress, is not refreshing or profane enough to deliver the effect Hit Girl does. As for the superhero perspective, while the first film felt refreshing, this film almost felt ""spoofy"" at times. In both cases, I think the directorial and screenplay change from the first film are at fault. Jeff Wadlow clearly had a different vision than many fans, including myself. One last negative, I hated the break in continuity from the movies by changing two characters, albeit they are fairly minor. Detective Marcus Williams (the black cop and friend of Big Daddy who becomes Mindy's care-taker at the end of the first film) and Todd (the less-important friend of Dave) are both played by different actors and neither feels right. Overall though, I hope it doesn't sound like I didn't enjoy this film. Moretz was amazing and Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Christopher Mintz-Plasse both do adequate jobs in the more tradition protagonist and antagonist roles, respectively. The action was really cool and the plot had tons of potential and largely lived up to it with the exception of the aforementioned flaws, in my opinion. If you loved the first film, you'll still probably enjoy this one quite a bit. If you found the first movie offensive, that feeling will not change here.",Kick-Ass 2
116,fung0,Excellent Follow-up,8,25 October 2015,"The low ratings for this film astound me. Kick-Ass 2 is a fine successor to the first film. It resists the temptation to rehash the original plot or themes, and instead takes the now-familiar concept to some genuinely interesting new places.The basic premise is solid: assuming these non-super superheroes persist in their activities, just how far can they get? In the first film, we see the absurdity of someone like Kick-Ass trying to do the work of the police - especially up against over-the-top villains. Our hero squeaks through based on luck and sheer determination. In the second film, we see the same guy seriously trying to live up to his aspirations. He trains hard, to become the hero he was only play-acting before. He also joins with others who've been inspired by him, each of them offering a different perspective on the whole idea. They're led by the one amateur who might actually know what he's doing: a gung-ho military type, perfectly played by an unrecognizable Jim Carrey.Along the way, we get a lot of the same uncomfortable humor and off-kilter social commentary that we saw in the first film. This time, we explore some new places (high-school values, for example) but the writing remains sharp, and continues to feel refreshingly off-beat.I don't think there's a third film to be squeezed out of the Kick-Ass franchise, but I greatly enjoyed both of the ones we've got. If you liked the original, I can't see any reason you wouldn't like the sequel very nearly as much - unless you have some sort of preconceptions of your own that prevent it.",Kick-Ass 2
117,RichardSRussell-1,"Nothing ""Comic"" about This Excellent (but extremely violent) ""Comic"" Book Adaptation",8,15 August 2013,"Kick-Ass 2 (1:43, R) — 8 — fantasy: comics & pulps, 2nd string, sequel, OSIT feministsThe film snobs over at The Onion's AV Club hated the original Kick-Ass and thot the sequel was only slightly better. The aggregators at Rotten Tomatoes had the opposite experience, with the original scoring 77% on the Tomatometer but the sequel clocking in at only 27% (still early, tho). IMDb has them about even and pretty good at 7.8 and 7.5, respectively. I loved the first one (it got an 8) and thot the 2nd one was just as good (also an 8). Of course, I'm a huge comic-book geek and appreciate more than most any movie that treats the comic-book genre with the seriousness I think it deserves.Kick-Ass 2 is violent as hell — and not Wile E. Coyote violence, either, the real bone- snapping, blood-spurting, knife-to-the-throat, screaming-death kind — and fully deserves its R rating. The opening scene shows a 15-year-old girl shooting a teen boy point-blank with a high-caliber revolver. Death #1 (an insensitive mother being electrocuted in a tanning bed) occurs only 7 minutes in. It is not for the squeamish.While the dialog refers to the extensive character list as superheroes and supervillains, the former should really be known as costumed crime-fighters, since they don't have a single superpower among them. The latter, I guess, need to be called costumed criminals for parallellism.Chris D'Amico, the teen son of gang boss Frank D'Amico, who was killed with a bazooka by Kick-Ass at the end of the first movie, is practically frothing at the mouth for revenge. Christopher Mintz-Plasse — yes, the little skinny, wimpy actor — is absolutely gonzo as the blood-lusting, sociopathic maniac. ""My superpower is money!"", he declares, as he proceeds to use his inherited fortune to buy up a band of costumed thugs to help him track down his nemesis and dispatch him most horribly and cruelly.Aaron Taylor-Johnson has a kind of thankless role as the eponymous Kick-Ass, high-school dweeb by day, self-questioning punching bag by night (which he can endure mainly because nerve damage from a beating in the first film left him mostly insensitive to pain), who nonetheless continues to believe that ordinary people have to stand up and be counted in order to make the world a better place. As more like him start coming out of the woodwork, they coalesce into a team, a la DC's Justice League or Marvel's Avengers.That team is led by a snarling, unshaven, cameo-clad Jim Carrey, as Mafia hit man turned born-again Christian Colonel Stars and Stripes. He picks up chewing the scenery where Nicolas Cage left off at the end of the first movie.But the unquestioned star of the show is the awesome Chloë Grace Moretz as Mindy Macready, a tiny, demure high-school freshman who's the brunt of psychological cruelty from the older girls in the school's ""in"" crowd, who sneer that she'll never amount to anything. She just shuts up and takes it, knowing she's already accomplished more in her brief alternate identity as a real, serious, super-competent costumed crime-fighter than the social butterflies will likely do in their entire lives. But she's promised Detective Marcus Williams (Morris Chestnut) — her father's former partner, who promised he'd look after her — that she'd given up that life. ""Hit Girl — that's not who you are."", he assures her. Oh, yes, she is!After young D'Amico, now going by the nom de guerre The Motherfµcker, and his gang waste nearly a dozen cops in under 5 minutes, the entire police force turns on anyone wearing a costume. Of course, it's easy to round up the ones who think they're the good guys, because they're not in hiding and they don't resist the authorities. This makes it all the more dangerous for the few who are still free solely because nobody knows their secret identities — but the baddies have an inside tip, and they vastly outnumber our heroes as they close in for the kill — which, make no mistake, will be a LITERAL kill.There are plot twists, ugly surprises, a fair amount of philosophizing, a (very) few laff lines, believably realistic consequences for violence, and solid dialog. Credit for the latter goes to Mark Millar, who wrote the original graphic novel, and Jeff Wadlow, who adapted it into a screenplay. Wadlow also directed, and blessedly eschewed the kind of frenetic, whirling, super-quick-cutting, too-fast-to-follow fight scenes that made Pacific Rim and the Transformers series so unsatisfying. Neither did he go for the tired old technique of snapping momentarily into slo-mo, which was already starting to wear out its welcome with the $6,000,000 man back into the 1970s. You watch these action scenes, and they look like what real people would really do in real life. Pretty good for a comic book. No surprise to those of us who knew they had it in them.",Kick-Ass 2

119,tr91,A brilliant sequel,8,19 August 2013,"The first Kick-Ass film is one of my favourite films so I was delighted when I heard there was going to be a sequel. I didn't think it would be able to live up to expectations but it certainly did, it is a brilliant sequel. Both films are at least on par with each other.The action again is fast paced and in some parts really gory, the humour is still there and the characters are all portrayed extremely well again. This one had more super heroes in it which I thought was good and it was more straight to the point. As in the first one I think Chloë Grace Moretz as Hit-Girl is the standout performer, she is unbelievably good in this role.Overall it was a worthy sequel, I would recommend it to anyone. Even if you don't normally like super hero films I think you may be pleasantly surprised, it is just a brilliant action film. This is probably going to be the best film of Summer 2013, I really hope there is a Kick-Ass 3 :)9/10 - Must watch.",Kick-Ass 2
120,achyutaghosh,extremely violent and outrageously funny,8,25 August 2013,"2010's Kick Ass was a surprise hit. Espousing vigilantism with graphic violence, ordinary people dressing up to fight crime never felt so charming and funny. Kick Ass 2 more or less builds on the R rated franchise's values- appalling violence, satirical pokes and colorful vulgarity in every frame, kind of continues in the rich tradition of being a counterpoint to world weary superhero tales.Kick Ass had ended when Dave Lizewski (Aaron Taylor Johnson) and Mindy McReady- Hit Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) had given gang-lord D'Amici a bazooka send-off from the top of a skyscraper. Kick Ass 2 picks up about 3 years after the events of the first movie with both Kick Ass and Hit Girl trying to adjust to normal life. However, Kick Ass has spouted a superhero craze, and however incompetent they may sound, folks with names such as Dr.Gravity, Colonel Stars and Stripes, Battle Guy Night Bitch and Insect Man are Dave's new friends, and Forever Justice is their version of Justice League. Christopher Mintz Plasse has graduated from the bumbling Red Mist in the first movie to an even more bumbling unmentionable name complete with an attire, and his only aim is to destroy Kick Ass, even though the only real talent he displays other than throwing money is naming super villains (Black Death, Mother Russia, Ghengis Carnage). In this quest he rounds up a variety of psychopathic killers for a final showdown that involves among other things, sharks, spiked clubs, and vomit inducers.Kick Ass may carry the name of the franchise but as a character he isn't half as interesting as Hit Girl. In the first movie, she was the breakout character- a 12 year old killing machine with a mouth straight from hell. Now 15 years old, she is fighting the toughest battle of her life, trading nun-chucks for boy bands and mean high school girls. Chloe Moretz is the heart and soul of the movie and Needless to say the movie gets extra shots of adrenalin when Hit Girl is suited up in purple. Jim Carrey is both unrecognizable and superb as Colonel Stars and Stripes, a former mob enforcer and born again Christian, unfortunately gets too little screen time. Christopher Mint Plasse is less a villain and more of an internet troll, and all the more hilarious because of it. Director Jeff Wadlow carries on with the same spirit as the first movie- carnage galore with killers that murder for fun ruling the streets, pervasively profane script, and fast action cuts.There it is then- very few movies can be this extremely violent and outrageously funny at the same time. Not as good as the original, but good enough for a sequel- 8/10",Kick-Ass 2
121,ajit2106,Kick-Ass 2- A good and brutal sequel,7,23 October 2013,"After the death of his father, Mindy, or the fearsome and ruthless Hit Girl, is forced to live a normal life as a teenager amongst envious and rampant cheerleaders among girls. Dave / Kick Ass is in crisis and inactivity, although he would be back in action teaming up with Hit Girl following his example wherever groups of improvised vigilantes and superheroes. On the other side, Chris, in order to avenge his father's death at the hands of Kick Ass, is reinventing himself in the guise of the improbable ""Mother**cker"" , enlisting a horde of criminal psychopaths to create his army to exterminate the executioners from district and especially wipe from the face the earth, his sworn enemy : Kick AssAs in 2010, the comic book adaptation Kick-Ass was released , it had to face the accusations , saying why they would not have stayed closer to the comic. Nevertheless, Kick-Ass has become an exhilarating and pretty brutal film that certainly has its panache. Kick-Ass 2 sets up where Part 1 left off, but also takes the liberty to not copy the literary model in detail.Director Jeff Wadlow takes the baton from Matthew Vaughn and stylistically adheres to the requirements of the first part. Even Kick-Ass 2 makes no secret of his drawn template. While others try superhero comic book movies as surreal elements in our real world to stage and largely dispense with gimmicks in the staging, Kick-Ass 2 shows its proud roots.The actors do their thing in the second part convincingly. Especially positive falls again Chloë Grace Moretz , who is fantastic as a curse forming and fighting, 15 -year-old Hit Girl, highly amusing and even Jim Carrey fits well as Colonel Stars and Stripes in the cast. The soundtrack accompanies the action again with familiar songs such as Joan Jett I hate myself for loving you.On the side of the bad guys you should not miss the absolutely loopy Christopher Mintz-Plasse, this time his Red Mist costume changes against SM clothes of his deceased mother and so acts as a Mother**cker, although he has no special powers, but he has the mafia and his parents' money to throw around. At his side is as beefy with Olga Kurkulina(Mother Russia) an entirely unusual woman. Kick-Ass 2 is right there at where it has ceased Part 1 and leading the story about Mindy, Dave and Chris continued. Both good and bad side to see many new faces masked and in the second part of beloved people must pay for their heroism. Stacked and downright parody is repeatedly discussed in dialogs, how important it is to find his place in life and this is Kick-Ass 2 operated perk to existing patterns of the genre. Technically you do not act binds tightly to the template, by staging the medium of comics is also present in the film at any time.Whether it comes to high school problems such as bullying and the first kiss or superhero problems - Kick-Ass 2 always goes with a good crop of fun on the subject and does not take itself unlike other superhero films too seriously. In the second part, it is highly entertaining to watch the heroes of some other comic book movie in their struggle for justice. It pays way out, wait for the credits, to be followed by a short sequence that might point to a third part. Definitely not a family film, morality certainly is at the stake and many religious associations could certainly disagree, but the writer Kick Ass 2 liked it, and as well a lot. You might not agree, but remember: ""I do not have superpowers, but I can pick you up on your ass.""",Kick-Ass 2
122,JPfanatic93,Decent sequel doesn't kick ass as it used to,7,23 September 2013,"The wacky creations of Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. return to the big screen in this sequel to the 2010 hit film Kick-Ass. Again centered around the premise of everyday people (that is, if nerds are eligible for that title) donning silly outfits and going out on the streets at night to fight bad guys, only to have things go wholly awry, we find Dave 'Kick-Ass' Lizewski (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Mindy 'Hit-Girl' MacReady (Chloë Grace Moretz) a while after the events of the predecessor, as they struggle to decide whether they should continue where they left off or just settle for a normal boring life after all. While Dave is adamant to return to the criminal infested back alleys to keep his fellow civilians safe from harm, Mindy is confronted by her custodian Marcus (Morris Chestnut) who keeps telling her she should stop such behavior in favour of resuming the normal childhood taken from her by her father, and go in search for her true self, disregarding the foul mouthed little crimebuster her father transformed her in. She does just that and quickly gets drawn into the equally vicious unforgiving world of teenage high school girls (walking talking clichés, but none the less hilarious for it). Meanwhile, Kick-Ass meets a band of fellow vigilantes, named Justice Forever, led by the seemingly mentally derailed born-again Christian Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey; his presence was heavily marketed for this film, but he's only in it for a screen time of less than ten minutes), with which he readily signs up. Trouble is brewing though, as his archnemesis-to-be, the treacherous vigilante formerly known as Red Mist (Christoper Mintz-Plasse), is hellbent on revenge for the death of his father – whom Kick-Ass shot out of a skyscraper window with a bazooka – and is determined to become the world's first true supervillain, for which he gathers an army of evil henchmen (dubiously called the Toxic Mega-C*nts) and assumes the outrageous code name The Motherf*cker. With tensions mounting as the new ultimate bad guy hunts down the members of Justice Forever in search of his benevolent counterpart to exact his revenge on, things can only come down to a climactic showdown of epically violent proportions. The main question is: will Hit-Girl find her true nature in time to come to the good guys' aid? Though the novelty of the concept of ""ordinary"" folks wearing ridiculous costumes and getting into more trouble than they anticipated has worn off since the first Kick-Ass was released, it's gratifying seeing our favorite take on the subject receiving a follow-up. Nevertheless, Kick-Ass 2 doesn't kick Kick-Ass' ass. Though still delivering a plethora of good gags and witty in-jokes, the emphasis on overly gratuitous violence and heavy swearing tends to rule the plot just a bit too much at times, being rude just for rudeness' sake, while most of the action scenes feel repetitive as they feature mostly costumed weirdos beating each other up with clubs, knives and the occasional guns instead of opting for more original scenarios like the previous installment did. As is the case with most sequels, this one just gives us more of the same without feeling the need to properly expand the world in question too much for fear of leaving its comfort zone. That said, it cannot be denied there's a heart and soul to Kick-Ass 2, and as was the case with the previous film, it's mostly centered around Hit-Girl. Whereas Kick-Ass' most endearing (and funniest) moments revolved around Hit-Girl and her father Big Daddy (you'd never think you would miss Nicolas Cage!), the same is true for Kick-Ass 2 where Hit-Girl's plot line tends to steal the show as she's off on her own adventure surviving the torments of being an unpopular teen girl in a world ruled by major bitches. And though Hit-Girl was always the most awesome ingredient of the franchise, it's amazing to see Mindy by herself works just as well without her alter ego, which makes us go without the purple suit for most of the film without missing it that much. As for girl power, we have the bad-ass new character of the hulking Mother Russia (bodybuilder and first time actress Olga Kurkulina) to do some serious damage to other people in the same style whilst in the employ of The Motherf*cker. In this regard, she's rather an exception, as almost all other evil henchmen, as well as the majority of Kick-Ass' new fellow protectors, get very little development. There's so many zany new characters with similarly goofy outfits that we can only hope for a neat DVD bonus feature to explore them all. Overall, Kick-Ass 2 gives us exactly what we were kinda expecting, an explosive and hilarious sequel to its predecessor that does an adequate job further delving into the crazy nature of vigilantism and fleshing out the characters of our beloved Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl a bit more, but lacks the smarts and charms that characterized the first film and feels otherwise rather a repetition of moves. It must be stated though, you haven't lived until you've seen Mindy melt over a Union J video clip. And as a bonus you get Jorah Mormont Iain Glen doing a very creepy New Jersey mob accent.",Kick-Ass 2
123,FilmMuscle,"A Much Darker, Less Funnier Entry",4,19 August 2013,"The original Kick-Ass was honestly a top-notch comedy, parodying the numerous clichés that haunt countless superhero movies and whatnot, causing most of its audience to proceed with non-stop laughter. It provided some originality at the time with its zany, silly humor and action, and it seriously was a thrill. Kick-Ass 2, however, decides to equip some incredible courage and advance in a fairly different direction. I'd like to bring up the example of The Hangover Part III at this moment, which released earlier this year and failed with its comedy, countering the quality of the original. Unfortunately, that trend rings true with this ""franchise"" as well. What hilarious concepts and material Kick-Ass brought to the table was immediately ruined by the emergence of Kick-Ass 2. Most of its jokes fall tragically flat and offer no amusement whatsoever. Many of the jokes that seem to carry on fail to deliver with its endpoint. For instance, a scene in the film shows Dave/Kick-Ass (played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson) repeatedly attempt to pull the zipper on his suit up, but it clearly looks like he's wiggling his ""willy,"" and it's all quite obvious on where it's leading to as his dad walks in on him, completely unaware of what exactly his son is taking part in but instantly presuming that he's masturbating. So, this was just one of those scenes that desperately pushed for hard humor but ultimately failed because these kind of jokes are overdone at this point and show no wittiness whatsoever due to their predictable endpoints. A lot of the comebacks sound terribly cheesy; for instance, a character in the film responds to one of the villains' statements by calling him a ""little bitch""- nothing original or clever in the slightest. It often feels like I'm listening to dialogue written by a fourth-grader. Another aspect of the film that feels largely strange is its contradictory tone to that of the original's because this one feels unbelievably dark. You witness an abundance of deaths-major ones at that-towards the last half of the movie as it nears its ""epic finale."" Now, normally, I wouldn't consider this bad at all. In fact, if this was intended as a straight-up superhero movie, I'd consider it one of the best in recent years, but the fact is that it's meant to be a parody of superhero movies, first and foremost, and a comedic outlook of the whole comic-book idea. What was mocked and ridiculed in the first entry becomes just a dramatic element in the sequel. Basically, it embraces the clichés that were jokingly pointed at in the original. Every single cliché in a superhero movie is bound to appear in this movie in one form or another whether it's a superhero grieving the death of a loved one or a goody-two-shoes superhero attempting to rescue a villain that had only recently murdered a close one. So, really, there was no point to this film. They could've created a whole set of different characters and produced a different movie with a different title, but since they decided to make another Kick-Ass movie, they should've known the kind of tone and humor that was required for the film. Believe it or not, the movie actually gets boring about midway because- like most comedies- if there's no great delivery of humor/jokes, then a comedy loses that entertainment factor. If you're not laughing when the film wants you to, then you'll surely feel offended and cheated out of a great and entertaining experience. After the sheer amount of negativity I fueled my review with, there are some ""plus's"" in the film after all. When it comes to the acting department, Chloe Moretz (Hit-Girl) steals the show. Her story arc forces her to encounter almost every single emotion in the book. Her eyes can tear up; she can act like a jerk; she can laugh excitedly- it's all there, and I believe that her career is quite bright. One of the biggest stars of the film- Jim Carrey (Colonel Stars and Stripes) - delivers a surprising performance. He doesn't look, sound, or act like Jim Carry at all, and that's terrific in my book. On top of that, you have the villains- among them being The Motherf**ker and Mother Russia- who are all distinctive in their own way from one being a total comic-relief addition to another being a completely ""roided-up"" badass who can rip any cop or object apart. That's another thing that bothered me about the film. The fair amount of realism from the first Kick-Ass was practically non-existent in this one. In the original, at least, you felt like you're witnessing an everyday citizen who's trying to make a career out of being a superhero. It was funny because just the thought of someone actually coming up with such a foolish idea already raises the possibility of the humor satisfying someone. With the absence of the realism, it contributes to the film's lack of hilarity. You've got an enormously muscular woman ripping doors from cars and lawn mowers launching into car windows. Like I said, it ends up wholly feeling like a superhero movie. I won't say the film's quality as a superhero movie/action flick is bad because it isn't. It's not unbearable, but the story was intended to be another off-the-walls, hilarious, action-packed superhero comedy, and it wasn't. Overall, Kick-Ass 2 is definitely a disappointment, and if you're looking to laugh a lot and think that this one's as enjoyable as the first one, you might want to steer clear of this one. However, if you're just looking for a movie that's crazy, over-the-top, and action-packed- if you're looking for the quality that should be present in every standard superhero movie- then you probably should check this one out, but it's not a must. Boy, now that I think about it, there have been a lot of stinkers this summer.",Kick-Ass 2
124,cnycitylady,Ridiculous,4,23 May 2014,"Where to begin? This film is, at its best, a joke. There is no substance to the plot and no integrity to its characters. It brings back the cast from the first film and adds in new fantastic actors so that they can act in a farce.The story jumps into extreme situations fairly quickly and then rather often and those situations fail to propel the storyline, or if they do they steer it in the direction of the silly. The lines are campy and corny leaving the viewer laughing at the film for all the wrong reasons. The elevated violence from the first film to this doesn't increase the ""heroes"" kick ass abilities but just makes you roll your eyes at the stupidity of it all. The first film wasn't exactly a gem in the film industry, but it was a damn sight better than this.Chloe Grace Moretz again steals the show as Hit Girl, but even her character has lost all of her bravado. She still swears like a sailor and beats the bad guys into submission, but there is less flare and swagger to her. Overall, this movie deserves to be kicked in the ass and promptly out the door without a whole viewing. 4/10",Kick-Ass 2
125,bravesfanc,Not quite as good as the first,5,18 August 2013,"Kick Ass 2 begins with a scene between Dave and Mindy in which Mindy shoots him at point blank range, twice. And it's a funny scene but overall the movie turns dark and a little depressing to be honest. But since I've never read the comics I don't know if it was meant for it to be like that. Talking with a friend who has read them, he told me the first movie followed the comics closely but didn't end well for Dave in which everyone hates him. So if that's the case, maybe this second followed a little bit more closely.The story is mainly ""Red Mist's"" character wanting revenge on Kick Ass for killing his father in the first movie. Except this time his name is something I can't type here. He recruits an army of evil super villains and together go after the superheros.You don't see much of Hit Girl in the first half or so of the movie as the focus is on Mindy trying to fit in at high school her freshman year. And it couldn't be more boring, only because it was pretty much a shorter version of the movie ""Mean Girls"" Three ""popular"" girls take her in and try to advise her on what to do and how to act. But when Mindy blows away the competition at dance tryouts, the most popular girl takes offense and the treatment of Mindy turns sour.Meanwhile Kick Ass has found a group led by Jim Carrey's character, who despite not wanting to promote the movie, is really fantastic on screen.The fighting scenes are up to par with the first film, including a final battle between all superheroes and super villains. What I disliked most about this movie was the performance by Christopher Mintz-Plasse. He was fantastic in ""Superbad"" and was pretty good in the first Kick Ass, but here it seemed he was trying to hard to be that character you fear as a bad guy and trying to be intimidating to others on screen. I didn't buy it and wish someone else could've played the part.Overall its not the most terrible sequel, and I enjoyed enough to give it an average rating of 5/10 but it doesn't come close to the first film in the way you care more about the characters on screen. It also has some depressing parts that might also turn people off about it.",Kick-Ass 2

127,themissingpatient,A Guilty Pleasure,6,17 December 2013,"Kick-Ass, better known as Dave, goes into training with Mindy, better known as Hit Girl. After making a promise to only be Mindy, she finds herself up against High School mean girls and struggling to become the person she is under the mask. This leads Kick-Ass to team-up with a network of people he has inspired to fight crime as super-heroes. Meanwhile, Red Mist becomes The Motherf****r, vowing vengeance on Kick-Ass and his followers.Director Matthew Vaughn's magic touch is missed. The villain is just down right embarrassing. For the first hour, the film serves better as a drama than an action-comedy. This is because we care about Hit Girl/Mindy, who steals the show along with a new character, Colonel Stars and Stripes. Much credit should be given to Chloë Grace Moretz and the actor who will not be named as he does not want to be associated with the film's violence. As for the violence, there's plenty of it. The first film was clever enough to make it necessary, even if in an ironic way, and it made good use of it. That's lost with the sequel. But then again you are watching a film called Kick-Ass 2. This time around it's all for the fun of it, a guilty pleasure.Kick-Ass 2 lacks is the first film's power and clever wit. But it delivers an epic story with some great characters and is as good as most sequels get.",Kick-Ass 2
128,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn review,4,1 September 2013,"Finally this summer we got to see the long awaited sequel to that overrated movie that is Kick-Ass. This movie gained massive popularity thanks to Jim Carrey, who stars in an almost cameo role, as he decided not to promote Kick-Ass 2, claiming ""I cannot support that level of violence"" after the Sandy Hook massacre. And now everyone hates Jim Carrey and idolizes Kick-Ass 2. I must admit, I did initially like the first movie – until I watched it a second time and found it pretty bad. But I think this explains how it got such good reviews: no critic has seen (nor will ever see) it twice, and probably not many fans have, either. And don't get me wrong, there's absolutely no reason to watch it multiple times. Kick-Ass 2, on the other hand, is one of those movies you either hate or love right after the first watching.Kick-Ass 2 picks up a few years after the first movie ended. Hit-Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) has been 'adopted' by her father's friend, and detective, Marcus (Morris Chestnut) who expects her to behave like a normal teenager and go to school. Instead, she and Kick-Ass (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) skip school in order to train every day. Meanwhile, Chris D'Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) accidentally kills his mother and inherits all of his family's fortune. So he decides to become a supervillain, names himself The Motherf**ker and decides to get revenge on Kick-Ass, because he killed Chris' father in the first movie.There's an almost-rule regarding superhero movies: the sequel is better than the original movie. That's not Kick-Ass 2′s case, and I don't even know how to start bashing it since there's so much that's wrong with this movie. First, there's too many characters and the only ones who are developed are the protagonists from the previous movie, and that's just because we remember all about them from the previous movie. Here, Kick-Ass is still in a relationship with Katie, after all those years, and yet she gets only a couple of minutes of screen time in order to break up with him – and he's not even affected by that! Also, bad news for all of you who wanted to see this movie because of Jim Carrey – he gets less than 8 minutes of the movie's time. Apparently, it's better to have 15 pointless, quasi-main characters than a few good ones. Quantity, not quality – sounds like we can't give a damn about anyone acting in this movie! Furthermore, the acting is so unimpressive I can't find other words to describe it better.Kick-Ass 2 is short, but manages to be extremely boring from time to time. On the other hand, its ending feels rushed compared to some unnecessary long, and some simply unnecessary, scenes. The lack of good humour is also worth mentioning, since the first Kick-Ass was mainly based on gore and humour, which was good sometimes. Here, we are expected to laugh at The Motherf**ker as he tries to rape a girl but has a momentary erectile dysfunction which makes him give up. This is probably all Jeff Wadlow's fault, the writer and director of this bad sequel. No wonder he's a no-name. I hope he never gets a job in movies again. There's also some bad CGI, but after all the other negative things I've mentioned, I think this is the least relevant one. Finally, a question spontaneously comes to mind: why would anybody watch this when there's Kill Bill – which isn't perfect but it's certainly much, much better?

129,CowherPowerForever,A Kick Ass Sequel,8,19 August 2013,"During the hype and build up of this film a certain actor in this film railed against all the violence, blood and gore. Well it turned out that actor was completely correct in saying the action and violence was over the top. But in my opinion the violence was not over the top it was perfect.No Matthew Vaughn this time around directing this film however Jeff Wadlow does an amazing job making the follow up film to Kick Ass which was truly an amazing film. While I feel this film overall is not as good as the first movie(as I will get into later) it is not because of director Jeff Wadlow. The action scenes are intense, violent, and simply stunning. Wadlow deserves much credit on this film.Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Chloe Grace Moretz are now the lone lead stars in this sequel. They are both amazing actors and shine in this film. However in the acting department overall this film doesn't seem as good without stars of the first film Nicolas Cage and Mark Strong. They both added so much to the first film and it is sadly not replaceable in this film. However I'd like to add that the group of secondary actors were great and worked well in this film and Jim Carrey shines. Carrey really steals the show in this film as General Stars and Stripes. I just wish his character was used more because he steals the show.Overall while I don't believe in my opinion that this film is as good as the first movie it is without a doubt a fantastic sequel. And in a day and age when sequels usually aren't that good this film breaks the mold. The film has over the top violence and action but it fits so well in this film. Do not miss out on this film especially if you are a fan of the first film and please don't listen to the big critics who think they know everything. Because on this one they are clearly wrong.",Kick-Ass 2

Why they didn't cut like 3 or 4 of these plot lines and like 10 characters I don't know. Had they done that, they could have focused on the action and the relationship between Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl. That is all I wanted from this movie. But no. They had to waste my time with Hit-Girl having a dilemma about being Hit-Girl, Hit-Girl being a normal, stereotypical teenage girl, Kick-Ass dicking around with some random superhero group, and so much other crap like that. None of it was necessary. Unfortunately, they left in all of it and we are left with this cluttered, unfocused crap. Such a disappointing movie. Definitely avoid.",Kick-Ass 2

This one didn't have a single memorable sequence. I kinda liked the characters, but it sure felt like a TON of this movie got cut, because it seemed like a lot of the characters just never really got fully fleshed out. Like, i wish we could have seen more of the bad guys doing stuff. No one, outside of Mother Russia, ever really DID anything or really seemed like a threat. There was the potential here for a really good movie, but it wound up just kinda lacking that zing factor that the first one had.",Kick-Ass 2
132,RMS1949,gives superheroes a bad name..,2,19 August 2013,"Yes critics did get it right.. It's that terrible. The first kick-ass was at least novel and had some storyline and was fun. This sequel was just so boring, so predictable and was just a money sucking excuse to make another. Despite the fact it has an R-rating, you get the feel it had an intelligence level that was made just for young kids who ,thanks to their video games, do enjoy their violence. Frankly I didn't see any of them as worthy of being considered a super-hero or super super- villain, just immature wannabes with a real lousy script. I'm hoping it ends here, but if it brings in enough money, I'm sure they won't let it rest. as long as it makes a buck the Hollywood producer/whores would keep making it until it's star becomes Hit-granny, not girl... :P",Kick-Ass 2

I thought it was slow to start and as a result a little boring. Hit girl is awesome as usual and kick ass reprised his role well. Red mist/mother effer was OK and his gang of villains were cool.I was pleased to see that all the original cast members returned saved Dave. The action sequences were good, but the action in the first part was much better. I didn't realize how much Nick Cage added to the first film. His absence was def felt in the sequel. Over all it was an OK film but there is just no way it can compare to the original.",Kick-Ass 2
134,eonbluedan-1,Rarely is critical reception this off the mark...,7,21 August 2013,"'Kick-Ass' introduced us to David Lizewski, who wondered why nobody tried to be a superhero and decided to fight crime himself. Simultaneously based on and released alongside Mark Millar's comic book, 'Kick-Ass' was a funny, stylish thrill-ride, with the trappings of a great comic book, and tough enough to trouble the moral guardians. Importantly, it kept the film grounded in reality whilst it had its despicable fun. At the same time as being a joyous romp, it never forgot the darkness it had to present; when people got hurt, it mattered, and when people did bad things to others, the audience could feel it. Whilst not a perfect movie in itself, the bold style made 'Kick-Ass' a major success! 'Kick-Ass 2' picks up with David missing the purpose of his Kick-Ass days, and Hit-Girl, his now friend and superior in the world of fighting crime, attempting to live the normal life of a 15-year-old Mindy Macready, whilst it is clear their actions have inspired many others to become costume-wearing, crime-fighting vigilantes. Chris D'amico, the pathetic, petulant son to crime boss Frank in the first film, is sore at Kick-Ass for taking away his father and is after revenge. After a temper tantrum goes amusingly awry and his mother dies, he finds his purpose in life is to become 'The Mother Fu**ker', assemble a team of super villains and kill our hero with his own bear hands.There has been a backlash to this sequel, and this is a surprising response; the film is not without flaws, but the negative reaction appears hugely disproportionate. So what are the downsides? It says a lot for the quality of the film that they mostly consist of individual elements that could have been changed or bettered. There is a 'Mean Girls' sub-plot involving Mindy, and whilst it plays fairly well for the most part, and is indeed an interesting idea, the method she adopts to ultimately ""beat them at their own game"" is out of keeping, not only with her character, but with the movie. Another moment not in keeping seems to be there for the sake of a joke about David appearing as a sleaze; his girlfriend is a completely different type of person to that which we saw in the first outing, and her one and only scene would have been better left. A rape scene in the comic has been turned into a joke about a would-be rapist being unable to perform, which treads an awkward line between amusing and ill-judged. The truth is this is another superfluous moment; the film would actually be improved by removing it completely and leaving the nastiness inferred. We are introduced to Jim Carrey's Colonel Stars and Stripes, an ex goon who leads a group of ""good guys""; their motives are good and their hearts are in the right place, though their methods are clearly questionable. This is not a problem, as it actually sets up a smart point which the film goes on to address directly in its final act, but it is unfortunate to see Carrey under-used so badly. Whether he had more screen time before his recent comments about not wanting to support this level of violence, we may never know, but it does seem his character is missing a lot of meat, which would have undoubtedly made him more interesting.On the plus, the dark, mean streak that underlies the first film is explored far more here. There has been scoffing about the needless and joyless violence, but I say it is precisely that reduction of comic tone that makes it work. One of the ideas driving 'Kick-Ass 2' is that in the real world, actions have consequences, and this film makes sure that is never overlooked! As the kids have grown up, so too has the idea, and I was myself surprised how much higher the stakes seem to feel, and the extent to which they go to drive home that this is not a game! The result is that, with rare exception, the violent moments feel more dangerous, cold, brutal, and consequently hold more resonance for the audience. In fact there is at least one scene where we genuinely squirm in the chair, feeling the helplessness and hopelessness of the plight we are witness to. You remember how you felt when Kick-Ass and Big Daddy were being beaten to death? A lot more of that...This is not to say the film is without its fun, well-shot, well edited action sequences; wait until you see Hit-Girl taking on bad guys on a moving vehicle! The first film is perfect for the story it presents; the comic tone it adopted made sense. With a change of director definitely comes a notably different approach, but where a lot of people would want a stylistic mimic of the first film, I for one welcome the tonal change. Jeff Wadlow is in charge this time round, and it would seem, unlike the critics, he understands that these characters have grown up a bit, and that the audience might just expect the story to move forward rather than stay static. Indeed, it is ironic to think that had Wadlow simply tried to recapture the first film's rebellious glory by playing the same game, the same critics would have accused him of treading water. In conclusion 'Kick-Ass 2' may not satisfy those after a repeat performance of 'Kick-Ass', and its darker approach might repel those simply after a slice of fun, but after a wobbly first act, this is saved by a CRACKING second and a STUNNING third. It also gives paid to claims that there is no sequence as great as the ""Hit-Girl saves Big Daddy"" one in 'Kick-Ass'; we care about these characters and it makes the finale incredibly gripping. This is a good follow-up; certainly worthy of its name! Also nice to hear that fantastic theme 'Flying Home' re-vamped, and so well used.Bring on the finale!",Kick-Ass 2
135,YJLcool,"An entertaining sequel, but not as good as the original",7,1 September 2013,"Kick-Ass 2 remains an entertaining sequel but the plot is just not compelling enough to fully recapture the magic of the original. The sequel also lacks the nice blend of gory violence and ironic, witty humor that made the first one so enjoyable to watch. (I gave the first film a rating of 9/10) There are too many characters in the film...the members of the Justice Forever are not given enough screen time or character development. Most of them ended up being forgettable, even for Night Bitch, who had a fling with Kick Ass, doesn't have much of a role in the film. Colonel Stars and Stripes was great as the leader, it's such a shame we didn't get to see more of him in the film. The plot point where Ass Kicker betrayed Kick Ass, which lead to a character's death, was not resolved or touched upon by the end of the film.The film explores more on how Mindy (Hit Girl) struggles to lead a normal high school life and being recognized as a normal teenage girl, so we get to see a somehow awkwardly paced American high school drama subplot of her instead of the Hit Girl & Kick Ass team-up crime fighting we eager to see. Some of the jokes associated with the subplot doesn't seem to be funny at all.The relationship between Katie (longtime crush in school) and Dave (Kick Ass) quickly ended just like that, without any subsequent follow-ups.However, the subtle chemistry between Mindy and Dave was nicely done in the film.Rather than adding build-up which leads to the finale, the film quickly sets up Chris as the new super-villain, The Mother****** and assembles his own team of forgettable super-villain characters, with the exception of Mother Russia.Moreover, Chris is shown as an immature, spoiled, rich mafia kid who tries to avenge his dad than a strong compelling, memorable villain.Contrary to the belief of many people, the seemingly gory, ultra-violent fighting scenes in this sequel is actually less stylized, shocking and (dare I say?) violent compared to its predecessor. The moving van action scene with Mindy fighting Chris' gang is poorly made..bodies are seen flying out of van, no one gets surprised by it and police cars or SWAT teams are nowhere to be found. The police are shown to be incompetent fools who can't even track and arrest the correct villains.Overall, it's still an entertaining watch despite its shortcomings. For those who really enjoyed the first film might feel a slight disappointment, but for casual movie-goers who doesn't mind the gory violence and foul language presented in the film, you might find it more enjoyable than many of the films out there at the moment.Rating:7/10 Note: There's an after-credit scene, hinting that there might be a third and final installment.",Kick-Ass 2

137,delightful-life,Rating is misleading.,9,27 August 2018,"This movie starts off where the 1st one left off, so it had a lot to live up to and the 6.6 rating is because people hoped it would take it to a higher level and thus were disappointed.The story - Lots of people start becoming super-heroes, but that prompts bad people too to become classic villains (especially the son of the villain from the 1st part), and thus a small war starts between them.This movies was 90% as good as the first, but did not have any big surprises. The main USP was to watch the little girl 'Hit Girl' grow up to be a teenager and struggle with what next to do in life.Go watch it, its not bad as the 6.6 rating might suggest. At the very least it is a 7.5.",Kick-Ass 2
138,sohansurag,"More Asskicking, Less Heart!",6,24 December 2013,"Directed by Matthew Vaughn, Kick-Ass was a breath of fresh air at a time superhero movies reigned supreme. Every superhero was trying desperately for a Nolan-reboot but Vaughn took a different route with Kick-Ass. Its dark and sick comedy infused with exaggerated violence and high- schoolers made for an amusing watch. I'd read the Mark Millar & John Romita Jr comics but never thought it'd be so violent, I just wasn't prepared to watch it unravel on screen. Despite my indigestion of the violence, its still one of my favorite movies.With Kick-Ass 2, Jeff Wadlow takes the director seat. Kick-Ass 2 follows Dave Lizewski's odd superhero tale post the events from Kick-Ass. Having seen Wadlow's mildly entertaining Cry_Wolf, I was rather skeptic about Kick-Ass 2′s fate. But surprisingly the previews looked just as good as the first and after watching the movie, its safe to say that Kick-Ass 2 delivers though not good enough to top over its predecessor. Wadlow plays it safe following Vaughn's style and the comics' storyline. The focus this time around goes a tad bit on to Mindy McCready and how she is coping up with her teenage life after her father's death. Our lead protagonist Kick-Ass is not without his own issues and he joins a group of fellow superhero wannabes, Justice Forever, lead by Captain Stars and Stripes. Amidst all this Chris D'Amico dorns a new supervillain attire by name The Motherf***er and yearns to bring Kick-Ass to his knees for murdering his dad. Rest assured its as comic, dark and equally violent action movie to the end.Soon to be seen as Quicksilver in The Avengers 2 Age of Ultron, Aaron Taylor Johnson still proves that he can pull off the looks of a nerd kid when he's already played the menacing Ben in Oliver Stone's disastrous Savages. Chloe Grace Moretz looks absolutely gorgeous and her performance astounding, as a disoriented 9th grader who is in conflict with her dual identities. A stupendous actor, Chloe acts with amazing prowess and I feel there is much much better in store for her unless she chooses to go the 'Carrie' way. Christopher Mintz Plasse is as spoilt, galling and naive as his Red Mist days and his stupidity knows no bounds as The Motherf***er. An almost unidentifiable Jim Carrey plays Capt Stars and Stripes and boy does it stand out!Kick-Ass 2 ups the ante a bit promising violence, cuss words and action topping Kick- Ass but the charm that the original brought was nowhere to be found in its sequel. The carnage and gore is over the top so if you didn't like Kick-Ass and his teens slashing and gutting their way through the first movie then don't bother watching this one as well.Henry Jackman's Kick- Ass's score and its soundtrack was simply excellent. But the score composed by duo Henry Jackman & Matthew Margeson for Kick-Ass 2 comes off as barely passable. It did sync with the visuals but when heard otherwise it just comes a notch below remarkable. Nonetheless just like the movie, the tunes stuck close to its previous instalment and tracks like Warehouse Showdown & Real Evil sticks to you. Kick-Asss was a gem that came from Vaughn and it will be cherished but its sequel? Not so much. Even if its remembered it'll be remembered as just a sequel and nothing groundbreaking albeit entertaining. I liked it, though not enough to recommend it as a stand alone movie but I am sure fans and superhero aficionados will like it.",Kick-Ass 2
139,randomStuff101,"Juvenile, flawed, but entertaining rubbish. Inferior to original.",5,9 January 2014,"The original Kick-Ass movie is a classic. This sequel doesn't touch it, not even close.That said, this film has plenty of action and stuff to look at and laugh at, but you need to consider why the first Kick-Ass was so successful. It had original, tight, clever, atmospheric, artistic storyline and details. Kick-Ass 2 lacks most of the shining qualities of the original.It does the job of bringing us more super-hero madness, more Hitgirl, and more of the fun story of these characters. But things seem unpolished, unrefined... perhaps giving away the change in directors or perhaps just the writing.There is something missing in the dialog that was present in the first. ""Interestingness"" and original flare is not here, but it's nevertheless an eye-candy sequel, with some crazy scenes, if often clichéd, stereotypical and overly juvenile.I gave the original 9/10, but this sequel only gets 5/10.",Kick-Ass 2
140,TheMovonka,Discover the superhero in you!,7,27 August 2013,"Long time no beating, are the words that come into my mind after being reunited with the young real life superheros of ""KickAss"". Those kids surprised me in an awkward fun movie, where no-names stood up and beat the ** out of even more awkward villains. Blood, bone breaking martial arts and Nicolas Cage in a cheap Batman costume caught my excitement faster than Hit Girl could strike down five Ninjas. Now the kids got older and the life has been changing for the main characters. Hit Girl has a new legal guardian who insists on keeping the superhero in her down. Despite that situation she can't quit past experience and keeps on training. So she trains Kick-Ass too, who got bored in his bog-standard High School life. But while KickAss gets his ass kicked, the ""Motherf*"" rises, seeking for revenge for his father. With a bunch of real life heroes, costumed and trained to support old ladies crossing the road or similar heroic deeds, our two protagonists have to stop the little wannabe super villain and his gang of crazy stereotypes. The story might seem simple, but even more complex are the messages which lay behind. In a great style mix of comic like scenery, quick camera movement and ordinary colorful images, ""KickAss 2"" resembles his predecessor and improves slightly in continuity. Within these images you recognize the real life aspect in the whole story without forcing any moral code. You see stories among stories. Teenage girls growing up, men who want to mean something, people getting friends and even though you are entertained by bloody violence you cannot take seriously. Additionally an expanded cast by Jim Carrey and Donald Faison creates an unknown creative mood in the KickAss universe, by distracting a bit from the core cast. Hence you will find the directors messages quite easily. Believe in yourself and remember that we all wear masks. Be aware that there are superheros out there, with or without cape and costume and things may end, but they are a new start too.With these subconscious messages you will enjoy a crazy and dignified sequel. Preposterous vulgar language, silly humor, astonishing brutal kids and even some romance result in ""KickAss 2"", the different superhero movie.",Kick-Ass 2
141,aldri-feb,A lazy-formulaic sequel,4,12 September 2013,"In 2010, 'Kick-Ass' had succeeded to surprise fan boys and critics by it's theme which is close to reality and teenage's behavior. The movie is so fun and hilarious. Also it makes it's star (Chloe-Moretz and Matthew Vaughn) popular these days. No wonder, the studio is enthusiastic to create sequel for this franchise. Unfortunately, 'Kick-Ass 2' suffers from many plot holes and inconsistent storyline. There are some stupid scenes in this movie like, the process of Chris D'Amico turns into The Motherf*cker and some scenes involved Todd/Ass Kicker. Jeff Wadlow as director tries to make almost the same formula from it's predecessor but he just fails to adapt and deepen the emotional of character which could be the influential aspect from the first movie. The only positive point from 'Kick-Ass 2', is the existence of Jim Carrey who is enjoyable to see and some bloody violent action scene although it's still nothing compared with 'Kick-Ass'. Overall 'Kick-Ass 2' is an unnecessary sequel to be made. The movie just ruin the image that Matthew Vaughn has built years ago.",Kick-Ass 2
142,jafar-iqbal,"Not as good as the original, but it holds up alright",7,19 August 2013,"Kick-Ass 2 starts where the first Kick-Ass ended – Dave Lizewski (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is still dressing up as a superhero; now, though, he is part of a group of superheroes, all working together to protect the city streets. Danger comes in the form of The Mother******, the new alter-ego of Chris D'Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse); Mindy Macready (Chloe Grace Moretz), meanwhile, is trying to leave Hit Girl behind and go through high school as a normal girl. Naturally, everything goes a bit crazy.I was a massive fan of the first movie – it was an original concept in a Hollywood severely lacking them. Yes, there are the obvious homages to Watchmen and superhero movies of the past, but Kick-Ass did a great job of telling its story in a fresh, interesting and laugh-out-loud funny way. Thankfully, for a good portion of the sequel, this trend continues. The characters are as entertaining, the pace is as frenetic, and the jokes continue to be funny.But there's something not quite right. What made the first movie so fun was that, apart from Kick-Ass himself, we don't learn too much about the other characters. Hit Girl is a special attraction, as is D'Amico and the rest of the crew. In this movie, though, they're given too much to do. I understand wanting to give Moretz more to do as an actor, and she's a good actor, but it ruins the Hit Girl aura. Similarly, adding all the other superheroes into the story overpopulates it. Probably the only one to benefit from added character development is Mintz-Plasse – as the newly-christened Mother******, he is the MVP of the film. It is from him that the majority of the humour comes, and deservedly so. Another disappointment is Jim Carrey. Carrey was meant to be the Nicholas Cage of this movie, but he's sorely underutilised. He's hardly in it, and isn't memorable when he is.What does remain as fun as ever is the action and the violence. As graphic and shameless as in the original, the bloodshed and body dismemberment are a joy to watch. As usual, Hit Girl is at the centre of the violence, and she couples her violent streak with those trademark adult quips. Kick-Ass and The Mother****** get in on the violence too, this time round, making for some exciting set-pieces.This film isn't awful, by any means – it does have some very fun moments. What it lacks is the consistency we got in the first movie. If you liked the ingredients that made up the first one, you'll get an extra helping of those ingredients here (arguably to its detriment). But it's still violent, and it's still funny in parts, and it still has some very good characters. Not awful; not great; but definitely still as fresh and interesting as its predecessor.",Kick-Ass 2
143,fuelrodx,Lacking in substance,5,27 November 2019,"I didn't know what to expect when I started to watch this one. Some originality was lost and the direction it took was a little over-the -top for me. Whenever a sequel is done, the moviemaker needs to make sure they don't overdo everything and simply end up making everything bigger and throwing in characters that dry up the script. In the end they just have a big fight as if we were doing an Avenger finale. Creativity is what we're after, and that's what we had in the first one.",Kick-Ass 2
144,jaywensley2004,A comic book's call to action,7,17 January 2014,"Standing between ""Watchmen"" and Christopher Nolan's ""Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Kick Ass 2"" renders a pretty credible examination of the popularity of super heroes.The character of Kick And and his cadre of average-guy super heroes are ridiculous; As they should be. The problem, as depicted in both ""Kick Ass"" films is, we sort of want them to be real. We want super-powered heroes who will protect us. In the middle of the silliness is Hit Girl, Chloe Grace Moretz's willing-to-kill ""baby Batman"" who accurately characterizes the reality that makes the fantasy impossible. With greater ambitions than it was capable of achieving, ""Kick Ass 2,"" while less fun than its predecessor, is a worthwhile finale to the storyline.",Kick-Ass 2
145,DarthPaul85,Not as bad as they say. Not as good as the first one.,7,17 August 2013,"Kick-Ass 2 is, if nothing else, a mostly fun juvenile fantasy. It picks up where the first one left off in terms of tone and reality and goes a bit further with it. What you can expect...-The world is a bit less realistic, more comic-booky. -The fight choreography doesn't come close to matching the first film- probably the biggest disappointment in the whole picture.-the violence feels oddly nerfed...it felt like a PG-13 movie somehow. I mean, there's violence, yes, and it's bloody, yes, but...everything feels ""safer."" Remember in the first movie, when you really felt like the heroes were in danger? There's much less of that here...if any at all.-It's still funny. A few of the jokes are ruined for you in the trailers, but I definitely laughed out loud a few times. -The characters are, for the most part, likable or enjoyable. I definitely left with a sense of wanting to see more of them. -Lastly, I won't give any spoilers for the plot, except to say that I have read the comic book too, and there are some differences here. Like in the first movie, however, I think the movie changes things for the better.Speaking of the comic, I think the reason a lot of critics panned this film is because of the plot. Which isn't the movie's fault, even, it faithfully follows the plot of the comic, which, frankly, just isn't as interesting as the first one's. Though the screenwriter did a great job adapting it to a 100-minute film. The first movie had a great hook, but the second movie doesn't. It just kind of follows the lives of amateur superheroes. Still enjoyable, yes, but not unique, and not as interesting. It's a story nobody would tell except that it's a sequel.Also sorely missing from this film are Nicholas Cage and Mark Strong. They both added a great deal of validity to the first film, and nobody can fill their shoes here. Jim Carrey is great, but his character is no Big Daddy. So ultimately, it's not as good as the first movie, but it's still fun. For people who've read the comic, definitely go see it! For fans of the first movie, go see it if you love the characters and want more of them. For people who haven't seen either...you might actually enjoy it more than anyone else.",Kick-Ass 2
146,jcallows,kick-ass in name only,5,21 August 2013,"The same principle cast members and even music composer from the first Kick-Ass reunite for this sequel but the results aren't the same. This is just another film that shows how important the director is and how talented Matthew Vaughn is. With so many hands involved in a film, it's hard to know what the director really does. But whatever it is, it must be big because we see the obvious difference between the Matthew Vaughn directed original and the relative unknown directed sequel, with of course the original being so much better.Gone are the freshness and innocence of the original. But this is expected. Time has passed, the kids have grown and the public has been exposed to these new superheroes. What isn't expected is what else this film also lacks. It lacks the playful tone that went along with the dark humor of the first film. This film is just dark. It lacks the emotional build up and punch for many its action scenes. Now action scenes seem to just come and go. Aside from the first major scene, the action scenes are generally less creative. And where's that odd, eclectic mix of rock songs? The use of them helped lighten mood in the first film and make the action sequences even more memorable. None of that exists in this film.There are other problems in the story as well, especially with Dave's character and his relationships. I won't even get into Mindy's return to high school. This film could've been much better. Instead, it's just another average action film. In the end, this film is just plain dull. If it didn't carry the name and fond memory of its predecessor, Kick-Ass 2 would've received harsher reviews and would've gone straight to video.",Kick-Ass 2
147,slicedbread117,"Kick-Ass is back, and ready for round 2.",9,25 August 2013,"Kick-Ass 2 was without a doubt one of my most anticipated films of 2013. And to no surprise, it delivered in the most Kick-Ass way a sequel can: be bigger, badder, and more entertaining than the first. While I won't say Kick-Ass 2 is better than it's predecessor, it is definitely just as good as it.The Positives: 1. Christopher Mintz-Plasse has given himself a new name in film other than McLovin; The Mother Fu*ker. While the terrific performance of Mark Strong as the main baddie is no longer available, Mintz-Plasse more than makes up for it by portraying a truly delightful villain. The Mother Fu*ker is a dark, humorous, terrifying, and lovable villain with a supporting cast of equally screwed up villains like the highlight Mother Russia. The Mother Fu*ker could very well be one of the best comic book movie villains of the last decade in my opinion, and was one of, if not the best thing about the entire movie. Bravo Christopher Mintz-Plasse.2. While Kick-Ass 1 could've been named Hit-Girl for all of her show stealing moments, KA 2 gives you more than one awesome hero to root for. While Hit-Girl once again has her insanely awesome moments, KA 2 gives you more to love and care about. Like, for example, Colonel Stars and Stripes, played by the one and only Jim Carrey, is a wonderful character along with others that deliver a supporting cast of well developed heroes for Kick-Ass that couldn't be found outside of Hit-Girl and Big Daddy in KA 1. And speaking of the title character, Aaron Taylor-Johnson delivers an even better performance as Kick-Ass displaying solid acting and more action. Simply put, the heroes and supporting cast in the movie are well developed and a blast to watch on screen.3. The action/story. In KA 1, all of the crazy blood-filled action was just straight up fun. There was no reason to make the action sequences full of emotional drama (while there was some) to make the action extremely enjoyable. In KA 2, the over-the-top violence returns but this time with some feeling behind it. There are definitely those action sequences that are just a blast to watch for good old fun, but thanks to a much darker story and villain, the action carries a much heavier emotional weight this time around. And this is good. The story gives a much larger sense of loss and darkness to it, making most of the action scenes a heart-pounding thrill to watch, in terms of crazy-fun and emotional entertainment.The (very few and small) Negatives: 1. The only part about the movie that held me back from giving a perfect 10/10 was the high school Mean Girls-style drama between Hit-Girl and the school's popular girls. While I praise Chloe Grace Mortez's performance throughout the entire film, and those scenes were important to Hit-Girl's character development, these moments seemed unnecessary to the movie, full of clichéd moments, taking away from what the movie is really about, kicking ass!With all of these wonderful parts of the film, not to mention the perfectly placed and executed humor and overall dialog in the film, Kick-Ass 2 makes for a fantastic sequel and a thoroughly entertaining film inside and out. I put plenty of hype around this movie and was not disappointed. Fans of the first film will fall in love all over again. One of the best movies of 2013 so far. 9/10",Kick-Ass 2

Hit-girl is back better than ever, Kick-Ass is back, and introducing our brand new super hero Jim Carrey who's hands down quite the badass just stealing the show! Bravo Jim Carrey simply a masterpiece that surprising to see Jim Carrey bash some skulls. Now folks don't believe the critics. They simply can't take a hit or too. This movie is fun especially for the fight scenes it throws. If you like the first ""Kick-Ass"" movie then you're probably gonna like this one.

149,donuthaters12,Safe And At Times Silly But Overall Entertaining,7,29 August 2013,"Kick-Ass 2 was a film that I never had high hopes for and I was prepared to dismiss this as a pathetic attempt of a successful sequel. After seeing it and had some time for it to swirl around my brain, it definitely was better than expected and surprised me in some areas. I am not one of those who have read the source material and have seen the first film (but I was aware of the events of the first film before seeing this film).Jeff Wadlow, the director and writer of this film, has written something that is fun and a little different from the hero films that have been made recently. The film's plot is easy to follow. It details the aftermath of the first film and explores the impact of Kick-Ass to the city, at the same time details the path that Hit-Girl must choose. Both stories are interesting and kept me engaged as Mark Millar's characters feels realistic and grounded. There are times where the film feels like a parody of the superheros of current comics, like Justice Forever is pretty obvious and definitely made me laugh the first time it was brought up in the film. The film does take a sentimental turn at times which does bring the tone down a bit which did surprise me but it was tolerable as it wasn't to the point where it felt too draggy or depressing. The film's script is not perfect as there are times where the film just felt silly. I just find The Mother****** an idiotic character, whenever he was on screen i either laugh at him or get frustrated. There are people out there who would love this kind of villain as it feels off the wall and ridiculous, it just didn't hit me. The dialogue in this film were fine but I hoped that there would be a bit more of a comedic banter between the members of the Justice Forever crew. I also think that Lyndsy Fonseca's character was a little underused and her role of the story was felt too shallow. Overall, the film's story is decent and definitely fun to watch, especially with friends.Jeff Wadlow did a decent job with this film. He was able to handle both stories without having one being to over-bloated and making the other story feel unnecessary or boring. As I have not watched the first film, I can't say whether Matthew Vaughn not handling this sequel could have brought this film down. There were times where Wadlow has rushed through the scenes, not allowing for characters to be fleshed out which makes audience care less about them as they feel expendable. In the Justice Forever, I definitely felt that only three or four members were important and I cared about. Even Kick-Ass' best friend felt expendable to me. I'm glad that the humor here doesn't feel too over the top, except for The Mother******, and it was handled also in a way that doesn't make the audience forget the point of the scene.Tim Maurice-Jones is the director of photography for this film, and his work here has some good moments and bad moments. The areas that I felt was good was the way the film looks. Instead of making the film feeling gritty, he takes an approach where colors and textures pop. New York, even though the film was shot at Toronto, looks hopeful and bright. At times if a film's setting looks too dark then it brings down the tone and making it more difficult to see the action that takes place. There are at times where the shot they used feels cheesy and overused on other action or superhero films, I thought a film this unique would also take an unorthodox approach in its filming.The film's score was handled by Henry Jackman, who has an impressive resume, and Matthew Margeson. Both have worked together on the music department but this is the first time where they both collaborate in the film's original music. I felt that the film's score was a little too safe and didn't really leave a major impact on me.Some of the cast from the first film follows to this film and for the most part, they're great. I have not seen any other film from Aaron Taylor-Johnson besides this one. He brings a childish and hopeful quality to the role which I felt worked. Chloe Grace Moretz on the other hand definitely owned the role. She was funny and during sentimental and serious scenes, she was fantastic in conveying emotion and weight. She impressed me in this film, like she did on her other roles in films like Let Me In, Hugo and 500 Days of Summer. Christopher Mintz-Plasse was great at playing his crazy and over the top character but I just can't connect to it due to the way the character has been written. Lyndsy Fonseca was underused in this film and definitely needed more screen time and story to make the break-up between Dave and Katie more convincing and important. Supporting characters like Donald Faison and Jim Carrey were hilarious, Carrey in particular.I came out of the theatre satisfied and entertained. I would definitely come back to this film after I get the opportunity to see the first film. This film probably would not stand the test of time but it does have a great appeal at the moment and definitely something great to watch with friends.",Kick-Ass 2
150,H_Spengler,"Awesome, just as good if not better than the first movie...",9,13 September 2013,"After a lackluster summer of disappointing action flicks (that's you ""Man of Steel"", and ""Star Trek Into Darkness"")I didn't go into ""Kick Ass 2"" with very high expectations. I was pleasantly surprised and how much I actually enjoyed it, (every so often I need to remind myself that there are quite a few films that critics didn't like, that I found great, and vice versa, so thanks KA2 for the reminder.)Chloë Grace Moretz is back as Hit Girl, struggling to come to terms with her identity outside of Hit Girl, and trying to differentiate herself from the two sides of her personality, Mindy and Hit Girl. Kids can be cruel, and while most of us have had a lifetime to get used to the fact and steel our nerves, Mindy has not, so her experiences are raw. The payoff, however is classic, and something i'm sure more than once we've envisioned wanting to do. I'm all about character development and believability in my movies, and this is is one of my favorite characters, i'm glad they gave her the opportunity to grow into more dimension, there is a part of me that secretly wished for a less repressed ""Hit Girl"" persona, but when she's there, she's there big, and it pays off. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is great as well, I enjoyed the storyline, and the rise and assemblage of the ""toxic c***s"". His transformation into The ""Motherf***er"" was initially a little too rushed for me, but then again, the will and predisposition to evil already were existing, so i'll give it a pass. Aaron Johnson was good too, loved the end face off between Kick Ass and The Motherf***er, reminded me a lot of the end face off from the first movie, but this time, it's a role reversal.Jim Carrey as Colonel Stars and Stripes, however, stole the show every second he was on screen. I read his total screen time added up to approx. 8 minutes, and I enjoyed every second of it. Carrey, (as he usually does) completely and believably immerses himself in character, I enjoyed Colonel Stars & Stripes immensely. (*NOTE to studio, I would love a ""Colonel Stars & Stripes"" origin story.) (*NOTE to Carrey, I hope you will consider this a possibility if offered, even with the objections you had to KA2.) Easily tied with Hit Girl for my favorite character.The rest of the cast was good too, everyone worked well together, and chemistry was there, and relaxed. I've read some flack about the Katie break up scene. It didn't really bother me that they broke up, but the reasoning was odd. It should have been an off screen mention of an event that happened prior to the events of the film. People break up all the time. Bottom line: great story, memorable characters, I didn't find myself once wondering what time it was, or ""is it going to end soon."" That to me is a good sign.9/10. Blu-ray worthy.",Kick-Ass 2
151,Targe,OK sequel which is on par for sequels,7,26 September 2013,"I was a HUGE fan of the original Kick Ass, which blows your mind because you think it's a lame-ass super-hero wanna-be movie like Mystery Men (which is awesome btw) and suddenly, half way through the movie, this little girl shows up KICKING ASS like no tomorrow, and the movie suddenly turns into a KILL BILL movie.You can't do that twice, though, cause, we see it comin'.So they did a sequel, and to give them credit, they tried reeeeel hurrrd, to do it, by doing character development between the two stars, and by dragging in Jim Frikken Carey, (who hated doing this movie btw, lame-ass) and still they fall flat, because there's no gag, no big surprise, nothing, other than Jimmy, to really distinguish this movie.The one saving grace is watching the Female Zangeef (never played Street Fighter, did I spell that right?) Mother Russia, destroy Five freaking cop cars and ten cops! I'm sure cops were walking out in disgust all over the US Nation over it, but I have to say, it was pure carnal glee to me.YOU-TUBE it. Seriously.I'm not sure how they could have topped or even come close to KA1 though, as it was a one-gag wonder, so good marks for effort. Please do not have a KA3. Wait for her to GROW UP for gods sake! Like wait till she's 40! Have a Watchmen-style has-beens come back out of retirement show or something.",Kick-Ass 2
152,phoenixyk1,Not a patch on the original,6,5 September 2014,"Much as I enjoyed the film... Th humor is labored and a bit too in your face this time.A shame as overall the story is good for a film that never intended to be serious.It's biggest issue is the laughs come from trying to be as crude as possible - Which honestly fails most of the time.If a little more thought had been put into proper laughs than trying to be crude - Like naming the main villain the ""Mother F**cker"" - I would have given at least an 8...Still, if you liked the first film, you will enjoy this one too.",Kick-Ass 2
153,fawn_jane,Still Kicking Ass,10,18 August 2013,"I had low expectations for this movie. I liked the first one, but I couldn't see how it could expand on the first one in a good way, and let's face it, sequels tend to suck. But I was proved wrong, and saw at the theater a movie that was fun, full of entertaining action, raunchy, hilarious, and had a bit of heart too.I dunno about you, but for me despite the title, Kick-Ass is all about Hit Girl. I went to theater wondering, what happens to Hit Girl?? I thought the idea of her trying to be a ""normal"" girl, as implied in the previews, was horrifying, but the way the writers of the movie handled it turned out just fine.My only quibble is that the characters arcs have heart to them, but ultimately go nowhere. The protagonists waffle over whether they should consider themselves superheroes, whether it's worth it, whether they are actually making the world a better place, but in the end they just seem to be back where they started. To be honest at the end I was bit confused as to what they were implying the characters intended to do. But it definitely looks like they are setting up another sequel; there was one character they introduced, and implied he would be important, then he is never mentioned in the movie again. In any case I look forward to another sequel.Finally I must mention that the fight scenes are amazing! It kept me interested and never got monotonous or mind-numbing as action sequences are inclined to become often times. The fight scenes are well-directed, the camera gets a bit shaky but it doesn't cut too much, which is popular but makes appreciating the fight scenes confusing and difficult. The action sequences are clever and fun, everything someone should want in an action sequence. I will never forget the part with ""Mother Russia"" and the lawn mower... that's all I'm gonna say.",Kick-Ass 2
154,DjfunkmasterG,Inferior Sequel,5,29 August 2013,"I thought the original KA was a decent flick, entertaining, violent, and a good deal of fun. KA2 is a boring 90 minute film, that doesn't exactly glorify violence like the media made it out to be, in fact I felt KA1 was more violent than KA2. Jeff Wadlow, the director of Cry Wolf, helms KA2 and shows a little improvement over his previous efforts, but in the end you have a film that lacks any real substance and doesn't go the distance with the original film.I felt bad for one person though, John Leguizamo, who had to work through this drivel. You could see he was phoning it in, and not by accident, most likely by choice because of the stupidity on display.Now I understand the KA comics were very over the top, but the translation to film isn't done very well for KA2, in fact many changes were simply for gross out gags, an example is when Mindy aka Hit Girl, gets her revenge on the HS girls who set her up, originally she dealt with the one girl and did it in such away you knew hit girl wasn't to be screwed with, that was by tying her up by one leg, and dangling her off the school roof, and timing it just perfectly that when she unties the rope holding her by her leg, she drops right into a truck carrying garbage and recyclables as it passes by the school, then calling her on her own cell phone and explaining if she pulls a stunt like that again... there won't be a truck. In the movie, it is done with a weird invention that comes up with the grossest ways to embarrass someone. (SPOILER - a device when pointed at someone, makes them vomit and get the runs) That single change alone is the sheer stupidity of the sequel and how it rather play up to lame gross out gags instead of the darkness Mindy deals with in being Mindy and Hit Girl.In the end I found I wasted 90 minutes of my life and completely understand why it isn't doing better business.Save your time and money...5 out of 10",Kick-Ass 2
155,mrrockey,A Sequel that Doesn't Suck @ss,7,19 August 2013,"I am gonna get this out of the way. I really don't understand the critics'opinion on this film. They said that it didn't live up to the wit and humor of the original and while the original is superior in these aspects, I still think this film is pretty good. Why do I think that? Let's take a look and find out!Firstly, the story. Now I'm not gonna do a terribly detailed plot synopsis here because this is fwcking IMDb! I'll mention some plot points here and there but come on, you can easily find the plot synopsis on this site so just go find it if you need it! Anyways, I think the story here is mostly pretty good. Kick-Ass in this movie deals with a dilemma about whether or not should he continue to be a superhero. At first, things go well for him because he's inspired a lot more people to fight crime like he does but eventually, Chris D'amico wants revenge on him for murdering his father so he becomes a supervillain called the Motherfwcker to destroy Kick-Ass and his team of superheroes. The Motherfwcker ends up killing his father and hurting his new girlfriend, Night B!tch(more on her later). He decides to quit "" Kick-Assing "" after that but then he realizes he can't stop being Kick-Ass because he can't hide who he is underneath when Hit-Girl tells him about it because she's tried to quit her superhero life and that didn't work out for him. He develops a lot more as a character in this film than he did in the original which is great!So there is a little more emotional depth in this movie but it's main goal is still just to entertain and I think it succeeds in that regard. The humor is still the same, over-the-top, raunchy jokes from the first film and it's pretty funny! But it certainly isn't for everyone. The action is very well-choreographed but they aren't as well filmed as the first film(more on that later). Still, they were pretty fun and I especially love the fight between Hit-Girl and Mother Russia. That fight actually had me worrying for Hit-Girl.The acting is once again top-notch here. Aaron Johnson does a great job again playing Kick-Ass very relatable and likable. Chloe Moretz plays up more of Hit-Girl's emotional and human side this time around and her character is actually a lot more interesting in this film despite her doing less superhero theatrics. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is still really funny in this film but I personally liked him better in the first film because of his chemistry with Mark Strong, but that's just me. Jim Carrey actually isn't in this film a whole lot which kinda disappointed me because I thought his character was pretty bad@ss! Overall, the cast was great!There's some stuff that bothered me such as I really don't like the way they got rid of Katie(Kick-Ass's girlfriend) from the first film. There really was no point to this whatsoever. They just put it in there just so Kick-Ass could go bang another chick in this movie. She's just such an unnecessary character and I really don't understand why did Jeff wrote this. Speaking of Jeff, how's his directing compared to Matthew Vaughn? I think he did a good job with the humor, drama, and tension but he doesn't have the same, great visual style of Vaughn. The original Kick- Ass was shot very-well with this great, clean, polished look to it while Kick-Ass 2 doesn't quite look as good. The worst example being the fight scenes. They are shot with the usual shaky-cam garbage that's in every action movie these days! They aren't terrible but I just missed Vaughn as director.I also think the one-liners for Hit-Girl were pretty weak in this film. There's just nothing clever about them. But at least, there weren't that many.Lastly, most of the new characters aren't very well established. Other than Jim Carrey and Mother Russia, most of them don't get enough screen time and they just aren't very memorable. I personally would have liked to see a lot more of them.Overall, I like the story, the humor, and the action for the most part so I'll give it a 7/10.",Kick-Ass 2
156,Liam3011,"Kick-Ass (2010) was more comedy... this was more action and in some parts, that seemed better.",5,16 January 2014,"Kick-Ass (2010) was a better film as it was more comedy. But Kick-Ass 2 for the first hour was comedy, but as the final 30 minuets drew in, it was more of an action film... and in some parts, it felt a lot better.The action was much better than the first film, more fast paced and all. But the comedy in the first film however was much better.CGI in some parts was over used however, and that really made the film feel lazy as if the director couldn't give a damn about making the film look more real, however, some of the areas which CGI was used was understandable and even looked cool at times.Another flaw, Hitgirl. She was not in it as much as I was hoping. But her scenes were pretty bad-ass, and you have to admit, she makes a great super hero.Overall, this film is a great comedy/action film and really... I am looking forward to the possible Kick-Ass 3. Let's just hope it comes, because I am pumped!! 8/10",Kick-Ass 2
157,jjgooner,Does not kick-ass,4,16 August 2013,"Kick-Ass 2**(out of 4)103 mins/ 15Cast: Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Chloe Grace Moretz, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, John Leguizamo, Donald Faison, Robert Emms, Morris Chestnut, Clark Duke, Jim CarreyDirector: Jeff WadlowPlot: Kick-Ass joins a group of crime-fighting citizens in war against Red-Mist who is seeking revenge for his father's death. JJ's Verdict: With Kick-Ass only making $100 million at the box office in 2010, many people would probably struggle to see why a sequel was made. Yes, it has done well in DVD and Blu-ray sales and was well received by critics but it is really clear to see in the film that a sequel was not needed. Where Kick-Ass felt detailed and original, Kick-Ass 2 feels cheap and repetitive and if you thought the first film glorified ultra-violence to the extreme, Kick-Ass 2 glorifies ultra- violence to the extreme in a comedic and totally unrealistic way with most of it performed on the good guys; not the bad guys, like Kick-Ass did (which makes that form of violence more accepted.)In Kick-Ass 2, Dave Lizewski/Kick Ass joins a team of crime-fighting superheroes called Justice Forever. The group, led by former Mafia enforcer but born-again Christian Superhero Colonel Stars and Stripes, become targeted by Red-Mist, who is now known as the Mother******, as he seeks out revenge for his father's death. Hit-Girl has now given up crime fighting and is trying to become a normal teen girl and fit in at school. However, she starts to grave her old life and in doing so receives the wrath of her guardian, Marcus. It is good that Kick-Ass is only an hour and forty minutes because even in its short length, runs out of material and ends up heavily repeating themes used in the original like taking off the mask and leaving it all behind (Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl both decide to do this about five times during the film and each time the film tries to make a big deal about it.) I'm okay with it happening once or twice but really, in this type of film, you know they are just going to end up with the mask back on and fighting baddies as usual. Saying this, the scenes where Mindy/Hit- Girl tries to fit back into civilisation are both emotional and heart-breaking but I think, due to the rest of the film being entirely unsympathetic, this is only because of Chloe Grace Moretz as an actress, not writer/director Jeff Wadlow.It certainly looks good and all the different superhero costumes have been made with a lot of thought and detail. The scenes with the Justice Forever group are very funny, mainly down to Jim Carrey, who isn't playing anyone he's played before but an entirely new character who is rather hilarious. It is just a real shame that his character, Colonel Stars and Stripes, is completely wasted and has his screen time limited to about five minutes. The film is funny in parts but its humour is certainly not for everyone, with most of it being sexually orientated. Jim Carrey was right. The film's main problem is its violence, not the content or the severity, but how it is used. It uses the most unrealistic violent scenes (complete with CGI blood) in a comic way and just expects you to laugh as the good guys and characters you sympathise with are slashed to bits and killed in the most shameless ways. If this was done realistically and in a serious way then I would be praising it and probably giving it a top review, but violence depicted in this way is just unacceptable in the world today. I am still wondering how the filmmakers could use an attempted violent rape scene as comedy entertainment.Though never boring, Kick-Ass 2 does not kick-ass. With its recycled plot themes, horrible use of talented actors such as Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jim Carrey and Christopher Mintz-Plasse and horrifying depiction of 'fun' violence, Kick-Ass 2 is one summer film to avoid – unless you're a teen boy who relishes this kind of shameless violence which means you'll probably love it!",Kick-Ass 2
158,ActionFan-Reviews,F*** The Critics,7,2 September 2013,"Reading the reviews of this only furthers my belief that mainstream critics don't know what they're talking about half of the time. On rotten tomatoes this gets around 30% whereas the one direction movie gets nearly a 70%?! my point exactly. Kick Ass 2 is action packed and hilarious and it's just as good as the first if not better. It's a natural progression in terms of story, characters. Hit-Girl and Kick Ass are back and better than before with more outrageous wannabe superheroes, and their up against a new gang of badder super villains.If your like me and enjoy R rated superhero/comic book movies you'll enjoy this as this isn't your average superhero movie for the kids that's all about the CGI and a fluffy PG rating, its a more bloody superhero movie that's grounded in reality not fantasy.Overall,it was a good movie don't listen to the critics. Just like the first set the stage for a part 2, this one sets it up for a 3rd and I can't wait for Kick Ass 3 !!7/10",Kick-Ass 2
159,CharlieGreenCG,"Not as good as the first, but still fulfills comic fan-boys wet dreams.",8,31 December 2013,"Kick-Ass's insane vigilante bravery has inspired many - budget superheroes have all teamed up to form a 'Justice League' wannabe team called 'Justice Forever', led by the bad-ass Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey). Meanwhile Red-Mist is reborn as 'The Motherf**ker' (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), and plots an act of revenge that will affect everyone Kick-Ass knows.The first movie kicked-ass (no pun intended), it was one of 2010's movie highlights – perhaps due to Matthew Vaughn's directorial aid. This time around take-over director Jeff Wadlow (Never Back Down – 2008) does struggle and makes the film feel less as a result. Trying to stick to the foundations that successfully molded its predecessor, Kick-Ass 2 somehow loses track of its winning formula.Whilst adapting most of the screenplay from Mark Millar's comics (which are quite dark and rapey) – the movie is added with more 'real' life situations. Leaning on the post of over-the-top Mean Girls to-the- extreme. By the way, the next time we see Chloë Grace Moretz, she will be again be bullied by the popular kids in 2014's Carrie. Causing her to show off her 'powers' once againContinuing on the violence, swearing, decapitations and not so subtle nick-names the film does produce an uncomfortable nature – and with some scenes extending it's humour that little too far that it doesn't make us chuckle the way it should.Regular cast Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Chloë Grace Moretz were still excellent in their roles and bring excitement to their next projects (2014's 'Godzilla' and 'Carrie'). As an added bonus Jim Carrey pulls off a very bad-ass Colonel Stars and Stripes. Which is nice, compared to the usual Carrey Ventura typecast. The very probable meaning of the film is improvised by Carrey's character 'Try to have fun, otherwise what's the point'?Verdict: Not being the film of the year it still gains and place as one of the most entertaining. With even more hype expected from the third installment – this blockbuster still fulfills comic fan-boys wet dreams.",Kick-Ass 2
160,canadian58,"Once again kicked ass, but not as hard.",9,17 August 2013,"The original Kick-Ass is one of my favorite movies, and this sequel makes it that much better. Rarely is a sequel equally as good as its predecessor. Such is the case here, as Kick-Ass 2 is not as good as the original, but stands on its own as a fantastic movie.Dave and Mindy are back in the real world, and Mindy is having a hard time fitting in at school. After Mindy's dad passed, his policeman ex-partner Marcus became her guardian, and then makes her promise to stop being Hit Girl and live a normal high school life. Dave is left alone, until he joins forces with Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey) and a crew of superheroes all inspired by Kick-Ass to fight crime. Meanwhile, Chris D'Amico (aka Red Mist) is on a vengeful mission to kill Kick-Ass for what he did to Chris' father. He creates a new image for himself, aka The Motherf&%*er, and hires a team of his own.This sequel does a lot more character development than the first, especially with Mindy Macready. In the original, Hit Girl is a hardcore, tough, fearless crime fighter, and we don't see a lot of human emotion in her. That's what makes this movie great, showing the human side of a great superhero. A lot more is seen of Mindy than Hit-Girl.Once again, the acting is great. Jim Carrey is terrific as Colonel Stars and Stripes. I wish he could have had a bigger role. Aaron Johnson suits the Dave/Kick-Ass character well, and he is a little better at fighting off bad guys, but not much. He still gets his ass kicked. Chloe Moretz is wonderful and steals the show again. Christopher Mintz-Plasse (The Motherf&%*er) is a lot meaner and a lot nastier. But still a wimp when it comes to fighting.Kick-Ass 2 contains far less violence than the first. But don't get the wrong idea. There still is plenty of it. Lots of laughs. A couple of tear-jerking moments.If I had to nit-pick, I'd say it ended a little too quickly. It seems after the final battle scene, the movie was in a rush to be over. Also, i wish Jim Carrey could have been in more scenes. His character was terrific.Overall, a good sequel, but a fantastic movie on its own. 10/10.",Kick-Ass 2
161,diomavro,Better than the first,8,5 December 2013,"I am aware that I am in the minority for saying this but kick-ass 2 is in my opinion even better than the first. There is something to be said for such a chaotic atmosphere where you get lost between comedy and drama. The volatility of the movie is reminiscent of how everything today(thanks to the net) is in bite size portions. This portrayal makes the story very real and you really feel the humanity of these people walking around with masks and their delusions feel very believable. I love the modern twist from the villain where he tweets and texts his enemies. It really is a modern superhero movie.Probably what was most impressive was that I didn't even know Jim Carrey was in this movie until after I went home, even though he played a fairly big role(I like to go into movies blind) and he played it flawlessly.The ending sequence was a little bit disappointing compared to the first one because there were too many characters which made it less engrossing(It did for me). The fighting was too separated, hit-girl and kick-ass didn't really work together they just picked their opponents and never complemented each other after that. Nonetheless this is great movie that personalizes Hit girl much more and gives her a more realistic character.",Kick-Ass 2

It was one of my most anticipated films of 2013. I'm a huge fan of the first one. This sequel is not as epic as its predecessor but I enjoyed it for the most part, it was entertaining and hilarious. The laughs are constant and the action sequences are thrilling enough. It delivers a satisfying balance between black humor and action. The cast is good as always, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Chloe Grace-Moretz and Christopher Mintz- Plasse did an amazing job. Olga Kurkulina was awesome too, she's an Israeli actress and her character ""Mother Russia"" is one of my favorites. It also boasts an impressive ending, wide open for a sequel.Jim Carrey was outstanding too, his performance was quite enjoyable, although it would have been awesome if he were a main character in the film. On the downside, it has way too much CGI on its action sequences, some effects are kinda laughable and crappy; also, there's a huge lack of the cast of the first installment. So, in conclusion Kick-Ass 2 is not as good as its predecessor but it's still entertaining, bloody and the new characters are likable. It is a decent sequel, but it could be so much better. I recommend it if you liked the tone of the first film, this second one delivers more large amounts of black humor, violence and profanity. It's just a pop corn flick, do not expect a masterpiece.

163,Rayvyn,"OK Movie, Should Have Stuck To The Comic Book",6,9 February 2014,"First let me say the first Kick-Ass movie was, well, kickass! But this movie, while pretty good, fell a bit short. This movie picks up with Katie being a teenage girl in high school. She's a freshman trying to fit in at school. That's part of the problem. In the comic books Katie is ten-years-old to eleven-years-old. Much of the entertainment value is derived from her being so young and being able to take out grown men and women who are gangsters. Kick-Ass is the same age and basically the same person.The main problem is they should have stuck to the comic book. For one Mother Russia was more of a character and how Katie dealt with her was much better than what she did in the movie. Kick-Ass seems to be the same incompetent hero he was despite training by Wendy.Another problem is with the ending, it totally departs from the comic book. The book ending shows Wendy heading off to jail and the movie ending shows her riding off on a motorcycle. In the comic book she utters a pretty funny line at the end.If you have a choice, read the comic book first, then watch the movie.",Kick-Ass 2
164,VenturousArtist,"""A sequel with high hopes - but low standards.""",4,5 May 2014,"Like many comic book adaptations, most of the films may stay faithful or change for the best. In most cases, despite their intentions, they can be for the worst. Even between, there's always going to be a subjective insight by the fans and newest viewers that find these creations either fitting or disjointed in their 'standards'. As a viewer of both original source material and the final adaptation, I'm admitting that this particular narration of the original story is both very flawed and fair enough.In the first 2010 installment, we're introduced to a new story that can be simplified as a satire and original concept that can relate to most of our crazed fantasies while the rest can be found as a ridiculous telling of how one high school student manages to survive countless lethal encounters with the most dangerous fugitives and partnered with sociopath vigilantes with different intentions. What worked in the first film can be justified by some smart crucial changes and purely full dedication from the cast and crew.However, like many franchises, the sequel attempts the same and doesn't exactly live to the 'standards' most of us are aware can't always be redone. Some of the changes in this film may have seemed for the best, but unfortunately has shifted the execution towards the mediocre. That's not to say there aren't any good things here, but overall there's many things that were done right in the sequel's comics better than the film.This is a sequel with high hopes - but low standards. The cast and crew did their best, they tried to compete with their previous challenge, and they gave their fullest effort to make this sequel good enough - but this should have stayed more faithful to the original source just as Dave Lizewski stayed faithful to crime-fighting.",Kick-Ass 2
165,kailomonkey,wraps up first film's story,9,14 February 2015,"I'm surprised how low this has been reviewed. Yes the first film was special but this isn't going to write the same magic again.I personally enjoyed the film and didn't find a lack of hit-girl action. There wasn't a great deal of it in the first one either, frankly. And I'm told the graphic novel previous to the films were way more... graphic.The whole going to school thing didn't make the most sense, and in my image of hit-girl I couldn't see her being upset by the opinions of a bunch of blatantly awful girls. Nor could I see her even being tricked. So that needs fixing or some better insight into her character. Or perhaps everything was there but I just wanted the action hero.Anyway, the film got the job done and it tidied up the loose ends the original left us with. Which I liked. It's nice to see big characters are actually mortal, unlike most series' where they just live on and on in some magical stasis of reality convenient for easy sequel writing and advertising icons you can re-use for half a century.",Kick-Ass 2
166,enigma-947-339467,Vulgar Trash - Where innocence dies,1,6 January 2014,"I'm besides myself trying to figure out who this movie is targeted at. Like another reviewer said, it's adult vulgarity, sex, and violence, targeted to children, and portrayed by children. What's next? pre-teens? Seeing teens act like porn stars is DISGUSTING. What's with this trend and where does it end? Like the first movie's rating, I'm astounded this one did nearly as well. Who is voting it up so high and why? I cringe every time Ms. Moretz drops yet another F-bomb, or tosses out another volley of crude porn-movie lingo. To say this movie has adult themes is like saying the sun is hot. Is she going to be another Lindsey Lohan or Amanda Bynes in a couple years? It sure looks that way.There were scenes, especially one where the ""cool girls"" are talking (no spoiler), that almost made me puke. The trashiest of trash I've ever encountered in my life never talked like this.Do teens think it's cool to sound like this? So if teens talking like trashy porn stars is what you like, then see this movie.All that aside, I didn't find any of the jokes funny. The action sequences were average at best, and EVERYTHING in the movie is 100% predictable. Epic fail.Seeing that so many people like this trash really makes me wonder where society is headed.

168,mecheart,"Teenaged gallows humor rated for adults, soaked up by kids",1,19 August 2013,"Fiction is a vehicle capable of transporting the reader, the viewer across spaces fantastic, gulfs of the never before expected - indeed on a journey limited only by the fuel of storyteller's imagination. As readers of novel's, watchers of movies we fiction addicts have crossed some strange territory, toured places dark as they were fascinating. Thanks to the minds of writers and film makers, we've transcended death and lived scores of made-up lives alongside countless characters of every stripe and in doing so, often found some small unpolished gleam we'd overlooked in our own realities waiting for us after we've put down that page turner or exited the theater.Despite the wild turn of the writer's imagination which so often effectively convinces us to abandon the laws of our mundane world for a temporary belief of the one he's created for us, the best fiction anchors itself to, firmly grounds itself in the real and in doing so makes those crazy daydream flights of the impossible we take with the storyteller, all the more impactful because before dropping us off in Metropolis or Gotham City, the best fiction makes us first journey through the world we live in everyday to get there.'Kick Ass 2' barrages the viewer for one hundred and three minutes with scenarios so implausible, the world it is set in - an actual city - serves only to mock its take after take on the ridiculously imagined capabilities of its characters and both theirs and its minor players' reactions to just about every hysterically nonsensical act of violence committed.The writer without realization gives his work a life of its own, an ability to transport those who consume his story again and again to places glazed with reality or wholly fictional, to meet people who only exist within the confines of those realms and thereafter within us, his audience. Unfortunately, these days and perhaps since storytelling has been around to some extent, the story strives hardest to justify itself, to celebrate its own existence and to quickly hammer down its justification for mass distribution.What a given lover of fiction finds amazing will indeed often vary from viewer and reader to viewer and reader - such goes without much thought. However, certain themes and depictions stories intimate to us, show us can be universally judged as good or terrible. Perhaps not so in a generational context as what one age group celebrates, another will find disgusting.In 'Kick Ass 2' most every theme and visual intimation is arguably a turn-off - unless you've while viewing it - turned of your wits, intellect and moral compass. The violence in and of itself is not the issue ... this reviewer is a horror, science fiction, action film fanatic which requires a hardy appetite for tragedy and violence. The problem with 'Kick Ass 2' is its exploitation of the innocent as vehicles for its smut, and depiction of kids as engines of homicidal or bone breaking destruction.The message 'Kick Ass 2' tells its viewers (millions of kids out there) that slaughtering other human beings - if they're the bad guys - is morally acceptable and cool. The film has its main characters break oaths, take new ones and break them as well and then its narrative attempts to justify the lies, deceit and misdirection as a setup for bloodshed by adolescents.That's all pretty heavy, right? Most would defend the message or the plot of the film as being just for fun. Unfortunately the movie takes itself very seriously despite the ceaseless gallows humor, and it really adores itself for what it is - a knock-off of a gory action film targeted at teens and even younger kids.Sure, I watched all the R rated horror and action movies I could rent and sneak into the VCR when I was a kid. Did all the gore and violence really scar my young mind? Probably not. However the vast majority of the gory, nasty Hollywood output of the eighties was not targeted at kids, nor did it depict kids carrying it out. It's a new thing, and I don't much care for it.Yes, 'Kick Ass 2' will entertain you to a varying degree and based on your age, will either feel like a guilty glimpse into the tactless future of the action genre and film making in general, or will look really awesome, dude.Give this one a pass, unless you want gawk guiltily at a movie equivalent of a grisly car accident.",Kick-Ass 2

I've read a lot of comic books but I don't expect movies to follow them exactly so the movie was good on its own merits. What I hope from a movie is the characters act reasonably given who they are. Kick-Ass is still a comic book fan so it makes sense he wants to join a super-hero team. In reality it is best to operate as an anonymous hit-man so police don't get too interested but then there would be no movie. The Chris D'Amico character was hilarious. He also thinks in comic book terms unlike his Uncle Ralph who is a real mobster. So he comes up with ridiculous ideas like Dr. Evil. I also liked Night Bitch. Obviously someone who is there for fan-service. Did you see her Night Bitch Justice Forever recruitment video?

170,xristoff93,Refreshing and lack of great ending,7,28 August 2016,"I have been hearing a lot about kick as 2 before I actually checked it out,usually bad stuff.I must say it did not disappoint me!Maybe the first movie introduced the but the second was as refreshing as ever.It had good action and new characters.Action scenes were awesome and the group of Justic Forever was really something.They brought a nice vibe in the film.Of course there were also some things that did not really fit in there.The acting was pretty solid and we got to see an aspect of the amazing Hit Girl,trying for the first time in her life to be a normal teenager.The way those bit**es and as**oles acted shows exactly what a shi*-hole high school is and how damaged are the people of those ages.Dave's girlfriend was so small in this movie I got a headache,so I am not going to comment on her anything else.Just lame.Night bit*h was fine and sexy,I mean that body was rocking!!But in the end she didn't seem like an appropriate match for Kick-a*s.So I am glad they did not go on.I expected something more from the members of JF,after they had just become a thing.They did some nice things and dealt with a case of gangsters and then star and stripes died.That was a bit of a letdown since he was an amazing character.Also we didn t see what happened of his dog.Dave and the fat one were acting like divas and ditched their friend Todd(I preferred the other actor better),I expected to see some developments there,between them,but in general the character development was kinda weak in the film,so it was to be expected.Only HG had some additions and expansions on her character.The ending battle should have had less killing among st the small characters,I mean it is not Kill Bill and it should focus more on Kickas and Hitgirl working together,at least up to a point.They were training and talking about it since the beginning of the movie and we did not see that anywhere.Hg was once again amazing!The Kickas vs dark f*ggot fight was cool with many great scenes but the dialogue somewhere towards the end got pretty weak...There was a nice escalation but the hype was for nothing.Kickas is just a nice and soft guy.He should either be displayed as a bit more vengeful or more righteous.Now we saw a bit of both and not in great sync,so the result was not the best.I hated how effing stupid his friend Todd was.Last but not least,some time after the middle of the movie,we see HG coming really close with Dave and towards the end of the movie we see her having some feeling for him.They look pretty good together and there is a deep connection between them.Their kiss was nice for Hollywood but superficial.It could have been a bit more important.Too bad they did not go down that way for those two.I am not into much of a romance,but since it was giving the impression it was going somewhere towards there,why not?It's a 7/10 for me,not more because of the bad ending and the weak,at times,plot.Overall I enjoyed it pretty much!If there is a 3rd movie coming up,I really hope they do not just stay on their former success and actually try for it to be a decent movie.",Kick-Ass 2
171,sunshinebeachcinema,"Awash in a summer of sequels and comic book movies, Kick-Ass 2 is sold on the back of sickening violence and crude language.",4,31 August 2013,"Awash in a summer of sequels and comic book movies comes Kick-Ass 2, sequel to the well received cult classic of three years ago, and based on the Marvel published comic book series by Mark Millar and John Romita. But where Man of Steel or The Wolverine take themselves seriously (though nobody could accuse Iron Man 3's Tony Stark of taking anything too seriously), Kick-Ass offers something of a deconstruction of the superhero genre, whilst fulfilling every comic book fan's fantasy of donning a costume and taking to the streets.The vast majority of the cast return, Aaron Taylor-Johnson topping the bill as Kick-Ass himself, though looking a little too old to play a high school senior. Though he ostensibly holds the title role, Kick-Ass takes a back seat to the continuing development of breakout character Hit Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz), who after vowing to hang up the cape after her father's death, must now become plain old Mindy MacReady and deal with the trials and tribulations of puberty and fitting in at high school.Christopher Mintz-Plasse, the immortal McLovin, returns as Chris D'Amico, who is pushed over the edge fairly quickly, first by the death of his mother, who meets her demise in a manner more befitting a Final Destination film than a supposedly light-hearted superhero flick. But that's not really what Kick-Ass is. It's lewd, crude, and graphically violent, and the worst is still ahead. There's something disturbing about a teenager dressing up in his deceased mother's bondage gear, especially considering the moniker he swiftly adopts. It's all played for laughs, of course, but perhaps it highlights just how unhinged and lost the character has become.The next ultimatum is delivered by D'Amico's Uncle Ralph, who has become the new head of the crime family. Still in prison, he steals his only scene with all the ruthlessness of The Sopranos' Richie Aprile. In retaliation, D'Amico ups his game, using his financial status to hire a motley crew of mercenaries: MMA fighters, Triads, and ex-KGB. D'Amico gives new monikers to his villainous team: a series of racist stereotypes which he defends as ""archetypes"".The protagonists are likable, and you are concerned for their survival, but the butchering of otherwise despicable goons is grim enough to stay the unconditional rooting for the good guys. The brutal massacre of ten New York police officers by a six foot Russian cannibal was particularly unpleasant. I'm not sure anyone in the cinema was laughing along with the comically fast paced Russian national anthem that played throughout. This is not an abject condemnation of violence in film. Tarantino's great, it's easy to sit through Django Unchained or Pulp Fiction, and many a plot has been moved forward when the death of a character ups the ante. There was just something about this film's attitude that did not resonate.This is all true to the source material, and the comics go much further in the sadistic displays committed by some characters. The comic is sold on the back of sickening violence and crude language, and that's just the way the fans like it. They've even complained that the original story's integrity has been diminished by these omissions.The narrative is split between the three leads, and Kick-Ass, looking to get back on the streets, joins a league of superheroes calling themselves ""Justice Forever"". They are led by Colonel Stars & Stripes, in a fantastic turn by Jim Carrey. Unfortunately, the film suffers from a character dump at this point in the form of the bland members of ""Justice Forever"", all of whom are utterly eclipsed by Carrey.I'm a fan of Carrey's work, but I haven't seen him in anything since the very average Yes Man (2008). Though his versatility is sometimes called into question by misguided projects such as The Number 23 (2007), and the sheer amount of times ITV insists on repeating Liar Liar, Carrey excels here, and is sadly under used.Hit Girl spends most of her arc locked in a generic high school movie. Treading the water at a saccharine slumber party, popular queen Brooke at first takes Mindy under her wing; exposing her to the heady delights of British pop music (I was surprised to find out that ""Union J"" are real – at first I thought they were a cheap One Direction clone created for the film or comic).The tide swiftly turns when a nervous Mindy uses her Hit Girl skills to unintentionally upstage Brooke at a dance try out, resulting in a disproportionate retribution of soul destroying (for a teenage girl) proportions. Brooke is treated to a crude comeuppance that seems weirdly out of place. Yet this high school coming of age story, whilst reasonably well crafted on its own, seems like small potatoes compared to the extremity of the other challenges faced, and is diminished as a result.I'm not a huge follower of comic books in general, but I enjoy the aesthetic, and in this, Kick-Ass holds true, with its bright colours, fast paced action, and satisfyingly euphoric soundtrack. Scene changes are greeted with comic book style panel inserts (""Later that day"") and a scene involving a Chinese prostitution ring is cleverly subtitled using speech bubbles.Perhaps I misunderstand the appeal of Kick-Ass. Maybe I do, and it's just not for me. The original, violent and thoroughly enjoyable film stirred none of these sentiments. You can't expect two films called Kill Bill to end without someone called Bill biting the bullet, and you can't expect to watch a film called Kick-Ass (or even Kick-Ass 2) without some asses getting kicked.",Kick-Ass 2
172,BharatSamra,"Do Pass, on Kick-Ass 2",3,25 August 2013,"Avoiding temptation, I will use my powers to circumvent writing Kick-Ass 2 ""Kicks Ass"" in this review. This should be made easier by the fact that this sequel to the 2010 original is immensely disappointing and will mostly entertain teenagers who are too young to see it.Unlike most soul-squashing sequels, Kick-Ass 2's pitfalls cannot be found within the film's narrative...for the most part. Kick-Ass 2 continues the story of its titular character (Dave Lizewski) and Mindy Macready (Hit-Girl) as they deal with the temptations of both vigilantism and 'normal' life in high school. When Colonel Stars and Stripes assembles ""Justice Forever"", a group of aspiring heroes, Kick- Ass leaps back into the green and yellow spandex, while Hit-Girl decides the school hallways are a more fitting suit for her. Meanwhile, a 'super'villain calling himself The Motherf*cker assembles his own team to take revenge on Kick-Ass and other heroes after the events of the first film, completing the premise.The premise is promising, and opens up some fun and entertaining altercations throughout Kick-Ass 2. Though predictable, it doesn't force itself not to be, and so is simple enough to follow also. Seeing the formations of opposing hero/villain teams gives the film its super strength and flight that elevates the story higher than almost all other abilities and features the sequel has. The more underwhelming aspects of the story involve Hit-Girl's, or now Mindy's, affliction with high school drama. While Chloë Grace Moretz does a great job in her role, the strikingly odd and alienating Mean Girls similarities feel exploitative of current trends, thus eliminating your enjoyment for the narrative overall.Kick-Ass 2 doesn't take itself too seriously. The film promises profanity, effortless viewing, blood and entertainment. Unfortunately, the latter of the four falls through the floor and is brutally ravaged under the new direction and writing of Jeff Wadlow. As if the director thought Kick-Ass (2010) was too acoustic, he attempts to amplify and exploit the sequel's predecessor with a messy, jarring and unbalanced 103 minute melody.Wadlow drops the genesis into a tank of thrashing sharks, hoping the messy splashes are enough to mask the abysmal continuation of a franchise that would have been better left unscathed. To reveal my true meaning, which no character in Kick-Ass 2 ever does, the simple and moderately enjoyable plot is surrounded by monotonous humour, senseless motivations and uncomfortable sexual exploits, involving 15 year-old dancers and a supposedly 'funny' scene suggesting rape. Further, the violence feels over-the-top even for over-the-top violence. This makes Kick-Ass 2 difficult to enjoy because the camera is shaking around in unison with your head's attempts to keep up, along with the shakes of disappointment and disbelief.It appears that the writer/director took the common comic book theme of identity crises far too seriously. There are too many moments of Kick- Ass 2 that feel out of place or imbalanced. Some scenes delve into dark narrative turns that force Kick-Ass to deal with the consequences. Then the following scene will have crudely unfunny moments of abnormal bodily dysfunctions. Unlike the first film, the two tones do not blend well as they are of such extremes that they can hardly see one another as they drift apart.More positively, Wadlow manages to introduce a few new cool characters to the team. The most notable members include Jim Carrey as Colonel Stars and Stripes, Donald Faison as Dr. Gravity and Lindy Booth as Night B*tch. Carrey and Faison aren't given an amount of screen time that would justify their characters being embedded into our memories. Nonetheless, they are appreciated when on screen as being some of the only actually funny and enjoyable elements in Kick-Ass 2.It is two hours of escapism sure, but there are times when the fire escape in the corner of your eye looks more appealing as you feel your head is about to explode. Kick-Ass 2 is essentially a recycled version of the first Kick-Ass film meets Mean Girls; it's the same gift with a new bow on top. Though you may wish to keep the receipt for this one as once unwrapped, you'll have wished you never received it. Kick-Ass 2 most definitely does not Kick A...ny other recent cinematic release from your attention, and I would recommend forgetting this film completely as it fails to bring justice to its significantly superior predecessor.",Kick-Ass 2

This movie is also pretty ambitious - there's a hell of a lot going on throughout this whole film, but they find a great way to balance all of the different angles going on, without overloading you at any time. Versatile is the word that comes to mind...let's run through the main points:Pros: Great casting, and solid acting. Don't expect any nominations, but it seems that every character has just the right actor for the job. Aaron Traylor-Johnson has clearly put a lot of work into this, because it looks like he's been working out with Chris Hemsworth and the rest of the Avengers. Chloë Grace Moretz is the perfect ""Hit-Girl"". Christopher Mintz-Plasse nails his character. Jim Carrey is great. John Leguizamo is in this! That guy deserves more work. And the movie deserves an award just for even coming up with a character named ""Mother Russia"". ACTION SEQUENCES. The 1st movie executed these to perfection, and the sequel follows suit. A great mix of high-level, slightly over-the-top martial arts action, lower-level brawling fights, gun play, high-speed chases, and even some explosions! And the soundtrack for these sequences deserves a mention. (When you have the previously-mentioned ""Mother Russia"" on a rampage, and a remix of the damn theme song from ""Tetris"" is playing in the background...you've won.) This movie is damn funny. You will laugh. Surprisingly emotional! There are a few scenes here and there that might just pull a heart string...they don't feel overly cheezy, and fit right in with the story...even the ""Mean Girls"" scenes.Cons: ........ ***thinking hard*** ...if I had to nit-pick, I could say that the movie almost goes too fast through a pretty major part. The movie is pretty fast paced throughout, but it might feel like a particular event may have deserved a bit more time to dwell on. Jim Carrey and John Leguizamo could have been utilized more. They were both great, but with so much going on here, it may have been tough to squeeze an extra scene or two for them.Now, the inevitable comparison: how does it compare to the original? If I had to make a choice, I've got the take the original over this one. That's not a knock on this sequel - it's very worthy of the franchise. But the original was so epic, that matching it was always going to be a challenge. I'll say this though...the sequel comes pretty damn close, and which one you prefer may easily be different from my choice.Overall, this is a damn good time at the movies...dammit. (I've just now noticed how many times I've used that word in this review...damn.) Get your popcorn and your snacks, get your seats, kick back, and kick some ass.Kick-Ass 2 scores a 4.25 out of 5 on the BDBOS. Good job.STAY THROUGH THE CREDITS!!! There's a bonus scene at the end that you will get a kick out out. Well..maybe ""kick"" isn't the right word to use...you'll see what I mean... :)(Hey there. Thanks for reading all of this. Really. Having your eyeballs all over this means the world to me. Especially those sexy eyeballs of yours. They're spectacular. Do you work them out? It looks like it.

174,HollywoodJunket,The Superhero Next Door!,9,16 August 2013,"he last time we saw Kick-Ass he struggled to answer the question: ""What is a superhero?"" He teetered on wanting to be the good guy who does the right thing, but also not cross the line. Big Daddy and Hit Girl, on the other hand, had the masks, the money, and the martial arts. They killed people freely if it meant getting the job done. So, though Kick-Ass was technically the first real-life superhero, most viewers would consider Big Daddy and Hit Girl the real deal. Now, the sequel delves a little deeper and asks, ""What does it mean to be a superhero in the real world? Are you a civilian disguised as a hero or a hero disguised as a civilian?"" In the sequel, Mindy or ""Hit Girl"" played by Chole Grace Moretz and Dave, a.k.a. ""Kick-Ass"" portrayed by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, practically swap places. Rather than Dave trying to get the girl and come into his own during high school, he's out in the streets beating people with his batons. Then, Mindy, who was able to kill multiple men each night without giving a single thought, finds herself being bested by a new kind of evil: the mean girls of high school.Kick-Ass 2 definitely packs a punch – both in humor and in battles. The flick follows a new group of superheroes, including a few of the originals, and their attempt to make the comic-book world a reality. Expect super villains and their evil lairs, homemade gadgets, a city in distress, and poignant family moments, a la Peter Parker and Uncle Ben. But despite following these traditional patterns, these vigilantes turned superheroes have to discover that, unlike comic books, real world crime fighting comes with real world consequences. This time, it isn't just evil drug lords getting maimed and killed, but some of the good guys as well, giving the movie a slightly darker tone. While some sequels fail to live up to the original installment, Kick-Ass 2 holds it's own and is really quite enjoyable giving it's viewers a little bit of everything: some laugh out loud comedy, emotional dialogue, self-discovery, puppy love, and of course, some kick ass fighting scenes. * Be sure to stay for a scene after the closing credits are done!

175,Rebel_With_A_Cause_94,A Sequel For The Fans!,8,1 December 2013,"This is one of those times I have to say Screw The Critics! Kick-Ass 2 may not be as good as the first, but it is still pretty damn good for a sequel! Lots of laugh-out-loud moments along with plenty of good fight scenes as well. Chloe Grace Mortez, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and Jim Carrey all nail their roles and steal just about every scene they are in. Although, I did think Carrey was underused and would've liked to see more of him. The film does become a bit too cartoonish and a bit inconsistent, but I was having so much fun watching it didn't take that much enjoyment out of it. If you are a fan of the first than I can almost guarantee that you will enjoy this one as well! By far some of the most fun I've had at the movies this year and better than any other comic-book or superhero movie to be released this year as well.",Kick-Ass 2
176,thefadingcam,"Confused sequel that copies the original, losing the surprise effect",4,28 August 2013,"The first Kick-Ass succeeded because it presented a mix of nerd humor with hardcore fighting and serious topics. The movie's outcome surprised everyone because of how grim it got. Even if it was a pure commercial hit, it was original and surprisingly good. This sequel, Kick-Ass 2 follows the exact same formula, except that in this case it turned out badly. The plot is generally the same, and it is not original anymore, failing to surprise the audience this time. The thing is that the movie wants to be realistic, it even criticizes high-school at a point (honestly, who cares?!), but, losing the surprise effect, the gore and emotional scenes do not make sense in a movie that has its bases on nerd humor. So, Kick-Ass 2 has an identity problem. It is confusing, it stalls too much, and it changes its mood way too many times, as if the director Jeff Wadlow had a cauldron and threw in there all the ingredients that made the first movie such a good flick. It's a shame, even if it is fun and entertaining to watch. Visit thefadingcam blog for more!",Kick-Ass 2
177,robin_sayer,Barely watchable,5,21 February 2018,"Its not horrible - but it does feel like this movie is made by someone still in school. The violence is all over the place - sometimes its seems to be toned down to 60's Batman style where people get hit but not hurt, and at other times the violence is just horrific. One scene of a bad guy getting kicked off a truck and then run over - is just one of the most horrific (and not enjoyable) things I've seen.However the movie is definitely watchable - because I doubt too many people will be expecting much from a sequel.",Kick-Ass 2

In fact, you'd better not watch this movie too close to mealtime. The profanity is jarring and continuous, with f-bombs about every 3 minutes, spearheaded by the idiotic name of the chief villain, ""Motherf***er."" The ultra-violence and ultra-vulgarity is reminiscent of a Quentin Tarantino flick. There are dismemberments, decapitations, explosive vomiting and diarrhea, crotch-mauling dogs, etc. It is difficult to write a spoiler for this movie because the plot is so weak. Consider yourself warned and avoid this grisly turkey.",Kick-Ass 2
179,agentk-77301,Could have been better but...,7,26 August 2016,"The movie focused on the wrong things most of the times. It didn't focus on the MC KickAss's breakup with his gf, which he clearly loved in the first movie. As if there was no impact from it and he just moved on to the casual hookups with the other heroine. HitGirls dilemmas weren't ""serious"" enough for me, or at least how they got resolved. The basic bitches with her? Really? In no way it could have happened. WHY it happened? What? Why the basic bitches are so smart compared to REAL LIVE basic bitches who can't even spell properly? Plus, how she resolved it was way over the top. Instead of winning at their game by getting popular and decreasing their popularity- She made them sh*t bricks. Almost literally. And puke a lot. Felt as if they just wanted to shock the viewers with over the top joke that isn't really funny because of the films original nature.Plus, Kickass fighting got suddenly bad and uninteresting (At least in the first half of the movie). His conversation with his dad was one sided (His dad was right) and he walked away like a small child instead of having an actual argument that can intrigue and make the conversation actually interesting. But it's not all bad! But, the villains journey in the movie was awesome. How he thought he is a real motherf*cker and then proved wrong just to become actually evil! Great scene! The following story development because of it was GREAT! HitGirl's character development was good from my point of view. They even said she isn't ""Apologetic"" and were surprised from her development. Well, I'll stop my review here. In short- MANY cons, but the pros are so darn good they make up for the cons. I give it a 7, but maybe because it's personally my style despite not being a real 7.",Kick-Ass 2
180,Dory_Darko,"Crap, crap and more crap. Literally.",1,23 June 2014,"MAJOR spoilers ahead!This is actually not so much a review as it is a vehicle for me to express my utter disgust of what was supposed to be a great sequel to what I consider one of the coolest movies ever made. I absolutely loved Kick-Ass. It was fresh, it was original, and in spite of its crude and graphic violence, absolutely hilarious. Its sequel, is nothing short of an abomination.For your convenience, I have comprised a list of Everything Wrong with Kick-Ass 2:1. The gore. It's not that it was worse than KA1, it's that it was very different in tone. Whereas in the first movie – where the violence was equally gut-wrenching – the nature of it all was laugh-out-loud hilarious, mostly because it was executed by a foul-mouthed 12-year-old school girl. KA2 on the other hand, feels more like a snuff movie where good guys and innocent bystanders are brutally slaughtered, just for the hell of it. Which leads me to point number two:2. The targets. In the first movie, the whole point was easy: killing bad guys. So, no bad feelings and no conflict of interest. For the second installment, it seems the moral compass has taken a 180 degree turn. Here we have to sit and watch the good guys dropping dead one by one, and it isn't the least bit funny. I'd like to give you a heads-up on the brutal murder of Dave's dad, the most innocent good guy of them all. Yeah, I didn't see than one coming either.3. The bad guys. Good god. Rarely have I seen such an array of dumb, sickeningly stupid villains. Most of the slaughtering and mayhem is done by one block-of-concrete-with-boobs called Mother Russia (what's in a name?). Everything about her just makes you sick to your stomach, especially the way she offs her victims. She is part of the main villain's gang, and don't even get me started on this guy Remember Red Mist? He was pretty funny in KA1, wasn't he. Yeah well, those days are over. After accidentally on purpose killing his own mother (!), he proclaims himself the new great villain of New York, henceforth calling himself The Motherf***er (again, what's in a name). He rallies a group of equally douche baggy cronies. Their mission is to kill Kick-Ass and all who follow him. Their first strike? Killing off the best new character.4. Jim Carrey's screen time. The poor guy clocks out at exactly 7 minutes and 45 seconds. He plays Colonel Stars and Stripes, and he is by far the best addition to the cast. What's remarkable about his performance is that he's barely recognizable. His speaking voice is low and brooding, and there's not a funny face in sight. Really cool character all around. After waiting for what feels like forever for him to finally appear, guess what; not ten minutes later – gone. Impaled, slaughtered and decapitated by Mother Russia. I'd like to have a hearty word with the ""screenwriter"" who's responsible for this. He needs to go back to school. Here's my advice anyway – free of charge: YOU DON'T KILL OFF THE BEST CHARACTER HALFWAY THROUGH THE MOVIE. Dumbass.5. The ""humour"". In KA1, the humour was cheeky, intelligent, and perfect satire. And where it was crude, it was right up at the top, but never really over it. Second time around, we have to make do with projectile vomiting and violent diarrhoea. Really, poop jokes? Now this is a perfect example of what 'we' (we meaning – people over 13 with normal intelligence and a healthy sense of humour) call ""rock bottom"". Yes. They go that low. I'm going to stop here before I start remembering all of the other ""jokes"". 6. Lack of proper Hit-Girl action. Hit-Girl was always the star of the show. In KA2, she is given a dumb sub-plot where she vows to quit her alter-ego job and become a 'normal', prissy little cheerleader, competing with other Barbie girls to become popular. I really, really hated this story line. I don't even care if it was in the original comics, it sucked. The reason why it sucked the most is because effectively, this means that the essence of Hit-Girl is completely vacant for about 60% of the movie! And that's WAY too much time for the most beloved character to mope around apologetically before she finally gets her s**t together roughly 10 minutes before the end of the movie.7. Mister Kick-Ass himself. Something went wrong here. I don't know if it was the character that was poorly written or Aaron Taylor-Johnson that came up short, but he was very different from the first movie, in which he had a really cute, geeky charm about him. Here, he was inconspicuous and dull, like a bystander in his own story. Or perhaps he was just overshadowed by the abundance of new and reformed characters In any case, he was barely there to be noticed.8. Soundtrack. The score of KA1 was so damn cool, with original, poppy punk music and electro that consistently added something to every scene. Here, I only remember one scene that caught that vibe and it still wasn't half as good.9. It was seriously offensive. A ""joke"" about rape? Are you kidding me?! And I'm not talking about some guys hanging around, talking about wanting to 'do' some girl or whatever. No, I'm talking about The Motherf***er seriously intending to rape Night Bitch, except he can't because he's got no wood. Real classy.There are some redeeming points to this otherwise complete crap fest, but honestly, they are so few and far in between they're not even worth mentioning. Well, I guess this is what you get for hiring some D-grade nobody to replace Matthew Vaughn. Don't waste your time with this garbage.",Kick-Ass 2
181,nando1301-1,Gratuitous graphic violence,1,31 August 2013,"Kick-Ass was a pleasant surprise; Kick-Ass 2 is a big disappointment. Definitely not as good as the first movie... this time the jokes are not as funny, there are zero surprises in the plot. Creativity was left behind. Apparently the producers thought that the lack of intelligent jokes could be compensated by adding gross ""humour"": people throwing up and shitting all over the place. That's supposed to be funny?? I found the violence unnecessarily graphic: dismemberments abound, blood is shed as if it was nothing. And this is supposed to be a teen action comedy? There is no need to show all that gore... Showing it as ""casual"" makes it more consumable and that is actually a very questionable proposition!",Kick-Ass 2

183,neazy,A mess.,4,21 March 2018,"A very disappointing sequel. Where the first film was sharp and fast-paced, this feels bewildering. It probably stems from cramming too much into one story - there are far too many characters, and new and old alike come and go with such careless abandon that the melee is laughably confused. The crowds of bit-part heroes and villains, the throwaway appearance of Emily, Uncle Frank's non-story, the irrelevant high schoolers - the list goes on. There are also far too many storylines set up without enough time to do them justice. The fast pace works in the first film because the story always knows where its going, and is therefore purposeful - every scene feels as though it belongs. Here, there is so much to keep track of that all the disparate elements hop around like a cloud of fleas - ultimately, they all become irritating and you'd really rather they went away. Add to this some dreadful dialogue, a less-than-convincing villain (I know this is sort of the point, but somehow the humour of his hopelessness in the first film is gone and it just seems lame and crass), and the fact that everything is as overblown as the first film but without backing it up with the same hard results - the humour and the playfulness are screamed out as 'HAHA LOOK AT THIS, YOU LIKE THIS DON'T YOU, REMEMBER HOW WE DID THIS BEFORE? LAUGH, PLEASE' - and this is a characterless mess. And the less said about the kiss at the end, the better.",Kick-Ass 2

First off, I loved the first one. Sure it was trashy and over the top, but it was still dramatic, well written, and well acted. So what's my opinion on the second installment of the Kick Ass franchise?I was surprised to see all the bad reviews that this movie got. Sure, it wasn't as good as the first one, but I still thought it was enjoyable. But I'm not going to act like I don't have my problems with it either. Cons: 1: Mindy's struggle to fit in during her freshman year of high school is interesting, but doesn't really add to much. So it's basically kind of a pointless subplot. 2: Marcus doesn't really play much of a role in the story except to scold Mindy for everything she does.3: Dave and Mindy getting together at the end is just odd in my personal opinion. However, there are good things about the film too.Pros: 1: Crap gets real in the third act. 2: The action scenes are incredible. 3: The scenes with the Mother#@!er are hilarious 4: Some of the intense scenes are actually pretty emotional.Again, Kick Ass 2 isn't as good as the original, but is still an enjoyable super hero flick that's worth at least one watch.",Kick-Ass 2
186,afdiazr,Far more entertaining than any other superhero flick of 2013,9,19 August 2013,"People these days seem to take violence in films with a truly moronic moral perspective. During the 70s there were a lot of hiperviolent films. We had Taxi Driver, for example. We had Halloween and the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre. We had Death Wish. There were no Twitters or Facebooks back then, and there wasn't this big 'violence in movies is bad' trend going everywhere. There were films about school bullies getting what they deserved, and there was a lot of blood and irresponsibility going on (Cannibal Holocaust is one example), and nobody went berserk at public schools the way it's been happening lately. So It's 2013 and we get a violent film with superheroes on it. I am 38 and my wife is 20, and we were both requested to show an ID to enter the screening for Kick–Ass 2. When I came out of the theater I was asking myself if all that was really necessary. This is just a fun movie to sum it up. Come on We had lots of gory stuff back in the 80s. Things that Fangoria was too proud to show in all it's bloody covers and there was (almost) no backlash from that. Are we far more stupid these days? Why do we need to be so politically correct in every bowl of cereal we eat and every word we spit? It is really moronic to blame entertainment for our own mistakes. I am a big fan of ultraviolent films, things like Martyrs, Irreversible or Taxi Driver, and I had never intended to exact on another human being what I saw in those films. So cut the moral speeches It's something that has to do with education. Entertainment is not there to educate. You're the ones who have to educate your kids. Take responsibility.So The film is amazingly funny and satisfying. I entered the theater with a little bit of fear that they could've ruined one of my favorite superhero movies ever, and it wasn't like that at all. The original Kick-Ass is by far more intelligent than it's sequel, and I think it has to do with the script. At the start of Kick–Ass 2 there's a lot of mediocre screen writing going on. With no action whatsoever, you can clearly see the actors struggling hard to deliver those cheesy lines. In that sense I figure my fears were met, but once the plot moves forward, with Hit–Girl struggling with her mentor and the things she considers to be justice, the film settles itself into overdrive and becomes pure guiltless fun. There's a lot of blood on this one, and in some ways it works the same path as it's predecessor, which I won't go into on this review since it could spoil the plot.Jim Carrey is magnificent here, as Moretz, Taylor–Johnson and Brown (amazing to have him here again) But Mintz–Plasse was a little bit of a letdown. Even though he's got some really funny moments, his character turns into some kind of an annoying evil guy which is not really interesting. That wasn't the case with Red Mist.In the end Kick-Ass 2 is like a bigger version of the first one, with more characters (most of them we don't really get to know) and the same kind of action and, even though it doesn't feel like it's the same movie all over again, it's not that original either.So, if you want to ride this ride just expect to be thrilled, nothing more. You won't get the same sense of wonder as you did with Kick–Ass, but you will be having loads of fun. Oh yes!",Kick-Ass 2
187,tuomas_gimli,How all sequels should be made,8,22 September 2013,"Despite the change of director, Kick-Ass 2 doesn't feel one bit different from its predecessor. It doesn't try anything revolutionary or groundbreaking, but what's here is very well executed and enjoyable. It's a prime example of how a proper sequel should be made.As a direct continuation from the first, the viewer should feel right at home with the familiar characters. The story feels exactly like a sequel should: changed characters facing new conflicts with higher stakes and new faces to join in. Hit-Girl is this time facing difficulties trying to adapt into the real world with her high school life, while Kick-Ass himself finds new faces to fight crime with. All the while Chistopher Mintz-Plasse's ""world's first supervillain"" (whose name breaks the IMDb review guidelines) goes through a frightfully convincing descent into madness and villainy and starts to wreck things up.Kick-Ass 2 brings a whole bunch of new colourful lunatics to the cast, with the standouts being Jim Carrey's erratic Colonel Stars and Stripes, and Mother Russia, played with ruthless authority by Ukrainian actress Olga Kurkulina. The cavalcade of new ""good"" superheroes in the newly found superhero team ""Justice Forever"" get fairly little screen time, but manage to feel like actual characters instead of mere cutouts. The acting is spot-on, and I struggle to find a single weak performance in the film.The action hasn't been softened at all from the first film. It's visceral, brutal, and immensely gratifying. If anything, Kick-Ass 2 far surpasses the level and amount of violence of the first, so much so that at times the viewer might be wondering ""Is it okay I'm having so much fun with this?"" Special mention must be paid to the sound effects team, because the various crunches and cracks really drive the physicality home. The final fight scene is truly spectacular, and the film is worth paying full ticket price for it alone.If I was forced to find bigger flaws in the film (which there are next to none), the tone of the film should be addressed. It sways wildly between comedic, brutal, somber, parodic and downright cruel, but it never feels inconsistent; the tone feels appropriate for each scene. To me it wasn't a problem, but some viewers might find the more extreme scenes wince-worthy, because of how dark and brutal this film feels at times. Recommendation: If you liked Kick-Ass, you're definitely going to like this. It's not the new Citizen Kane, but if you're up for a good, bloody, violent time, Kick-Ass 2 delivers in spades.",Kick-Ass 2
188,david-robin,a reasonable review,3,19 September 2014,"Kick-Ass 2 is the typical movie sequel, where the evil guy of episode 1 is not really dead, and wants its revenge in episode 2. The second effort is usually the opportunity for the film-makers to optimize their gross margin by cutting on advertising (great)... as well as on preproduction (script), production (cinematography) and post-production (SFX) costs. Not so great.Kick-Ass 1 had gain some popularity because it was notoriously for its pointless violence, and the famous ""12-year-old girl"" mini-scandal.Kick-Ass 2 does not picture the ambition to be more violent, or more sexual, or more controversial in any way. No, the sole purpose of its writer-director seems to grab more money from the younger white-trash audience :-The scenario is flat and predictable (""shark"" final scene).-The cinematography is terrible, with no clear directorial choice in composition or scene cuts. I felt lucky enough that color balance was preserved though the film.-The actors pretend to impersonate excessive characters, but are just acting poorly (as illustrated by Jim Carrey or Aaron Taylor).-The SFX are questionable, and even the ""chroma key"" effects are better executed in TV series.-The fight choreography is terribly boring (the ""truck roof"" scene) and predictable (front kick, anyone?).Hopefully, the final credits scene will not open the doors to a 3rd occurrence of infamous Kick-Ass.",Kick-Ass 2
189,Jwdjrs,My favorite movie of the summer!,4,4 September 2013,"So this summer, I went to the movies a lot. I saw Iron Man 3, Man of Steel, Pacific Rim, Lone Ranger, Monsters University, and The Wolverine. But, then I saw Kick-Ass 2 and was blown away! I thought nothing would beat Man of Steel. I loved the first Kick-Ass and was excited for 2. I ended up liking it more than the first one.One thing that shocked me about the first one was how poorly it did at the box office. Even though people loved it, it wasn't a great, big money maker. The second one has made roughly $25 million. At my local theater, it stopped playing after only about twenty days after being released. This stunned me and made me kind of mad because more people should see these movies.This movie is full of action, especially toward to the end. Also, it's packed with laughs. It has more of what you liked in the first one. Red Mist is back (with a vengeance) and has gone far off the deep end. He literally kills people for no reason, sometimes. Kick-Ass is still going around the city, looking bad guys, as he inspires others to be superheroes, including Jim Carrey.Mindy (aka Hit-Girl) tries to be a normal teenage girl. She tries to stop being Hit-Girl, so that she can be normal and fit in with the other girls at school, which is something that the film really focuses on. Though, when she is Hit-Girl, it is pure awesomeness!I really recommend this to fans of the first movie, and superhero fanboys, like me. This is by far my favorite of the summer, maybe even the year.

192,jcdugger,An R-rated movie for kids?!,4,16 August 2013,"The first ""Kick Ass"" was a decent effort. Not particularly my favorite movie of all-time, but its certainly watchable. I hadn't anticipated watching KA2, especially at the theater, but I found myself purchasing an opening-night ticket out of sheer boredom.Now, if you're a teenager, I'm about to sound like a grumpy old man. And maybe I am. But seeing uniformed police officers get savagely ambushed and murdered shouldn't be anybodies cup of tea. I thought how the killing of the officers was done in particular (up-close scenes of uniformed cops being shredded by bullets before having any chance to respond) was terribly in bad taste. I'd have to think that is #2 on my complaint list though. My #1 complaint, or question really, is: at what point does parading around a 14-year-old girl constantly with ""screw me"" looks on her face become child porn?! Seriously. 14 years old...and in this movie she's dating, kissing, dressing up as a slut, consistent ""adult-eyes"" close-ups, and - of course - saying the ""F"" word constantly. Didn't anybody call the real police during filming?! It was off-putting to say the least.Those cringe-worthy scenes aside, the movie still had gaping holes in it. After numerous police are killed, news stations are somehow still fixated on the townsfolk dressing up in costumes. No federal response whatsoever. Then, after Kick Ass'es dad gets killed (who the news is reporting as the actual Kick Ass), they show his funeral surrounded by about a half-dozen cops. Really? Evil super-villains just killed dozens of cops...then they kill what people think is Kick Ass (somehow got to him and got out even while he was sitting in a jail cell)...and the police response at the funeral was a few random cops?!?! In real-life, the FBI would have taken over the town and that funeral would have been swarming with, heck, a near military presence. Even later in the movie, Hit Girl incredulously asks her father ""Who's gonna stop the bad guys if not me...you? The townsfolk playing dress-up? WHO?!"" Um...how about the joint task force of the local police, FBI and CIA?! She kinda skipped over them as possibilities somehow! In the end, things like that in this movie made little sense.If you think I've covered the mess entirely, you would be incorrect. Even a 17-year-old Kick Ass is, get this, screwing one of the other superheroes in bathroom stalls quite frequently! And I don't mean somebody teasing them about it...they actually show the bathroom stall shaking back and forth while all the moaning is going on! They might not be showing it, but you know...right behind that bathroom door, he's doing things to her you wouldn't do to a farm animal! The worst scenes of the movie, other than all the cop-killing, has to be an near-unwatchable couple minutes where they mix in vomiting with fart/diarrhea jokes. This might have been the first ever R-rated movie exclusively for kids.All-in-all, this movie lacked class. It attempted to appeal to the lowest-common denominator. They even sold it as Jim Carrey having a decent-sized role...he didn't. (Though Carrey was probably the only bright spot I could find in this movie...he was good as usual). If you're a thinking adult, pass on it. If you're a raunchy kid or tween, this will likely be right up your alley.(Love IMDb!) JD",Kick-Ass 2

Was it Good Enough?,6,3 September 2013,"When i saw the first one i was blown away, it was different then all the other Superhero movies were about but Kick-Ass isn't super is he? no he's just a comic geek who dreamed of helping people by being super, thats awesome!Now i was actually really excited for Part 2 because i didn't know how they would top the first one, hoping it would match it or go beyond.Jim Carrey being in the movie i went nuts, i thought it was going to be amazing then when i finally saw it on the first day...It was disappointing, its good but its fast paced like if they rushed an entire 2&1/2 hour script into an 1 hour and 50 minute movie.The Acting was bad, but the character development was thereThe Comedy was childish some parts did please me but it wasn't the same.The Story was all rushed in my opinion like if everything was on a shoe string, i know the first movie had a low budget but they made it like a big movie and it was!The Direction wasn't there most of the times it felt like the actors were the only ones keeping the movie up to watch.Jim Carrey probably played one of the best 15 minutes he played in the movie he did fantastic as well as Chole Grace Moretz, Aaron Taylor Johnson and Mclovin.It felt gross watching the movie maybe its just me getting older because when i saw the first one i was in high school and watching it made me feel like if i was back but reminded me deeply how under develop Hollywood makes high school like so that was a big dull moment in the movieThe Action is well done so to say even if the blood is friggin digital.I liked it, Jeff Wadlow did an OK job, he treated us with good character development and action with childish comedy but he's not close enough to hate him but lets face it, he half assedThe Original Kick Ass still kicks ass!",Kick-Ass 2
195,Rage-Kage,My favorite movie of the year?,10,16 August 2013,I had some really high expectations for Kick Ass 2 considering how much I loved the first one. With such high expectations I was a bit skeptical that the sequel could live up to the first. But it not only lived up to my expectations it passed them.The characters were all done so well and the tone set throughout the entire movie is just perfect. It makes you feel the feeling you get in a regular superhero movie where you feel like yeah we NEED the superheros to stop this. the death of unexpected characters ( if you have not read the comics) and going through those traumatic events along with the other characters makes you feel as if your growing along with the characters. I liked how Hit Girl was not actually Hit Girl for a good portion of the movie and we really got to see her character grow up and figure out who she really is. I also liked watching kick ass turn into someone who can really kick ass and also just like Hit Girl grow up and realize who he truly is.Something I think is really worth mentioning about this movie is the main villain The Mother effer. Yeah he was kind of an idiot at times but you really got the feeling that even though he's not the smartest guy in the world he really was evil. One of my favorite parts in the movie was in a scene where he visits his uncle in prison. His uncle has somebody close to Chris D'Amico killed and he finally completely snaps and truly becomes an evil villain.Now I could probably go on and on about every little this about Kick Ass 2 that I loved but I would be typing for a LONG time if I were to do that. So I'll leave it at what I've already talked about and say don't listen to the haters if you loved the first movie go see this one. If you hated the first movie go see this one anyway because it was really good.I'm more then happy to give Kick ass 2 a 10/10,Kick-Ass 2
196,ScottGentry,"Lets hope, that Mathew Vaughn takes the reigns of the third installment.",6,31 August 2013,"Kick Ass 2"" (15) Director: Jeff Wadlow. Starring: Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Chloe Grace Moretz, Jim Carrey and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. Running time: 103 minutes. Rated: 15 for containing strong bloody violence, sex references and very strong language. Out now in UK cinemas.After the actions of Kick Ass (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Hit Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) in ""Kick Ass"", their bravery (or stupidity) inspires people to stand up to injustice, become superheroes and join the crime fighting group named Justice Forever, led by Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey). Soon, Chris D'Amico (formerly known as Red Mist) hears of Justice Forever and decides to counteract the superheroes by assembling his own team, led by the world's first super-villain, The Mo*********.It is without a doubt, that ""Kick Ass"" was one of the most original and ambitious creations to be released in 2010. It was different, it was gritty and above all, it dared to go that little bit further. Heralded 'shocking', by both critics and classifiers alike, ""Kick Ass"" really did turn the tables on the comic book genre, by delivering a fresh and brutal piece of film-making. Written and directed by newcomer Jeff Wadlow (2008's ""Never Back Down""), his direction is good but doesn't offer the same style as Mathew Vaughn and has instead gone for a cheap style of Hollywood remake. His script is entertaining, but not satirical in it's approach. It almost feels as though he has deliberately gone for a script which has some of the qualities of ""Kick Ass"", that can relate to people who aren't fans of comic books.""Kick Ass 2"" is just as brutal as it's predecessor, but not as effective. It includes all the stabbings, punches and villainous high jinks, but it never seems to be quite as entertaining as it should be. There are many memorable sequences, including a fight scene which takes place on the motorway and a fight in suburbia; but it just doesn't feel enough. The cast have acted well, delivering fun and fresh performances; including Jim Carrey as Colonel Stars and Stripes who has improved on some of his later roles like ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"". VerdictIt may not be the sequel we were all hoping for, but it was entertaining, brutal and above all; satisfying. Lets hope, that Mathew Vaughn takes the reigns of the third installment.6 stars out of 10 = Good.Written by Scott Gentry.",Kick-Ass 2
197,jeffrey-utley,Better Than 'Kick-Ass',8,24 August 2013,"'Kick-Ass' very much surprised me when I saw it. I went into the film with somewhat high expectations, but it exceeded them. I then went into this film with higher expectations than for the first one. My expectations were exceeded in 'Kick-Ass 2', also.How was the acting?Overall, the acting in this film was good. Aaron Taylor-Johnson did well in this film like he did in the first one. Chloe Grace Moretz did very well portraying Hit-Girl/Mindy Macready. In this film Mindy goes through many stages, and Moretz portrays her well in all of them. Christopher Mintz-Plasse did very, very well portraying Chris D'Amico, the rich, spoiled kid. Jim Carrey usually plays the same character in the films he stars in, but like Nicolas Cage did in the first one, Carrey played Colonel Stripes and Stars very well.How was the writing?The writing in this film was overall very good. The screenplay was written well. The dialog between characters seemed fairly realistic, and character's actions showed reaction to how they are. The density of the characters was also somewhat deep.Did it have an interesting premise?This film had an alright premise, but nothing special. The premise of Chris D'Amico building an army to kill Dave Lizewski, and I liked Dave Lizewski teaming up with Colonel Stripes and Stars, Battle Guy, Night B%>#^, and a few other as a ""justice league"" thing. It shows how good they are, and what good things they do. I however, mostly did not enjoy Mindy Macready's side story with her stopping being Hit-Girl thing. It started off somewhat interesting, but it eventually got somewhat boring and uninteresting. There were some emotional parts that did work, but that was only in one scene. The story of this film was good. I liked the events and I liked where the story was going. There were also some things that happened that were very abrupt and intense and that I didn't expect. That's a positive thing. Those events made me say ""wow"". They also used more emotion in this film than in 'Kick-Ass'. With as rich as the characters are, it worked for the film and had me on edge in one scene.Was it entertaining or boring?Other than a slightly slow beginning, which was better than the slow act in 'Kick-Ass', the film was very entertaining, and very easily enjoyable. The entertaining parts were even more entertaining than in the first installment. Overall, the film was very enjoyable.What things in particular did I like (that I haven't already covered)?The directing in 'Kick-Ass 2' was really good, and the action scenes were very thrilling and somewhat intense in some scenes. This film was also more humorous than the first one. There was one scene when everyone in the theater I was in was laughing into the next scene.What things in particular did I dislike (that I haven't already covered)?This film didn't have many flaws to me. My only problem with it that I haven't stated is that I think the film could have been done better and have been more entertaining and humorous for what it was.How was it overall?'Kick-Ass 2' was a very fun film. It had very thrilling action sequences, comedic qualities, good action, good writing, a bit above average story, and was easily enjoyable and very entertaining. It did have one side story I didn't care for and it could have been more enjoyable and a bit more humorous, though. 'Kick-Ass 2' is a very good film. I give it 3 1/2 out of 4 stars and give it a B+ on the grading rating scale.Do I recommend this film?I very much recommend going to see this film in theater, even at regular showing price.Will I buy this film?I'm not quite shore if I will buy this film. I possibly will, but I might not.",Kick-Ass 2

200,alwaysplanb,They toned it down -- a little too much,5,19 August 2013,"Two reasons why I am neutral to this otherwise good movie: 1. They toned it down a little too much. I've read the comics and when I heard that a movie was in making, I wondered how they are going to remake this brutal story. I'm glad they removed the whole Katie's assault angle and instead decided to take a comic turn with Night Bitch. However, they ALSO removed a lot of grittier stuff that would have made this movie a cult classic. 2. The whole Mean Girls angle with Hit Girl was a dud. I didn't enjoy it in the least. If they wanted to show the troubles Hit Girl is facing while living the life of a normal teenager, they should have avoided the clichés.Now I really liked the action. They upped it a notch, and showed some cool scenes with the Hit Girl. However, the Times Square Brawl finale was missing, and that is a bone of contention for me. I'm still wondering why they chose not to include the Times Square Brawl(or any Square for that matter) like the original story. This movie had budget less than the original. They could have thrown in some extra bucks and shot a grander finale.Anyways, the comic fans will definitely be disappointed. As they have twisted the whole story. However, as an individual movie, this will definitely appeal to some people. This is purely a one time watch and that too because of Chloe's superb performance as Hit Girl.",Kick-Ass 2
201,cathalokane,Horrible sequel. Just awful,3,15 December 2013,"Kick Ass is one of my favourite films. It's clever, funny, original and gets all of its various elements just right. It scores on every level and is in my view the very best superhero film there is. OK, it's not as good as the Dark Knight films but you know... it's different, it's self aware. It's the anti-superhero film par excellence.This film is about as far from the original Kick Ass as it is possible to be. It should be called ""Sucks Ass"". I have no idea what happened in the writing and production of this film but they managed to lose almost every semblance of wit that was in the first film and they have replaced that with a load of over the top Tarantino-esque violence, and a few knob gags.I had heard this film was not as good as the first, but nothing prepared me for the turgid awfulness of what I watched tonight. I was watching the diabolical end ""fight"" through my fingers as the sheer mind-numbing terribleness of it had me involuntarily face-palming. I'm not even going to bother mentioning the plot (was there one?), but let's just say this film veers haphazardly from mindless blockbuster action smash right through to cheesy teenage school chick flick and back without ever managing to entice a giggle.Remember ""With no power comes no responsibility""?! Yeah, that made me guffaw with laughter too. Even the opening suicide smash of the original Kick Ass has more humour than this entire film and all it's terrible ""jerk off"" jokes combined.Awful awful awful. The only reason I'm giving it three stars instead of one is erm... well I don't even know. I guess the stuff that has been shamelessly copied still half works, such as the music (songs all used in exactly the same places etc) but aside from that there are almost no redeeming features.I now see very clearly why Jim Carrey wanted to disassociate himself from this film. It wasn't because of the violence. It's because its a terrible, terrible film.",Kick-Ass 2
202,marcusdean118,Falls very short of it's predecessor,5,18 January 2014,"The first Kick-Ass was a triumphant success, a film that despite displaying the same genre tropes (social outcast, loss of a close relative, seemingly unobtainable girlfriend etc...) packaged them in a completely skewered way that felt fresh to witness. By rooting the tale in a 'real world' setting, it up's the stakes of the peril facing our heroes while also presenting a satirical look at our own world and how we deal with not only superheroes but with violence also. Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman's first film handled that delicate balance masterfully. Sadly, Jeff Wadlow's sequel does not.By losing Mark Strong and Nicolas Cage from the original, Kick-Ass 2 had a huge hole in need of filling at both sides of the spectrum and despite Jim Carrey turning in a wildly impressive performance (in relation to his frustratingly short 8 minutes of screen time), it is perhaps on the side of evil you notice this more. Christopher Mintz-Plaisse is woefully under-served as the films main foe and despite having a few funny moments throughout, he is never given the chance to shine and the film's bizarre plotting ensures that for every one step forward (nick-naming seems to be a talent of his) he takes two steps back. Evidence to this is the one scene cameo of Iain Glen as his Uncle in prison who threatens him to stop pursuing Kick-Ass, to which Chris says no, forcing his Uncle to kill Chris's only confidante (in itself, a very effective scene), only for this to do nothing to dissuade Chris as he continues with his plan anyway. And we never hear from his Uncle again. Unnecessary scenes like this plague the film throughout and they really hammer home how disappointingly short Carrey's role as Colonel Stars and Stripes is. His performance is compelling as he sinks into the role, but rather than revel in it, the film only allows him two stand-out scenes and then continually uses it's supporting cast of character to eulogise him and ram down the audiences throat just how important he was despite his brief tenure as the leader of the pack. You really wish they could have trimmed the fat in other sections of the film to afford more Carrey time as the crazed Colonel.With the lack of the Colonel on screen, comes a lack of fight. The film falls into a lull after his character meets his demise, with the delicate escalation of events in the first film being replaced by a mish-mash of random events seemingly undoing each other as they reach their rather uninspired climax. Moretz is again eminently watchable as Hit-Girl, but considering the most she gets to do is make people defecate themselves and stare at her Father's suit, the viewer can be forgiven for missing Big Daddy as well. The film itself is not a bad one, it can have it's rather enjoyable moments, but in comparison to the first one, it falls decidedly short on all levels.",Kick-Ass 2
203,Caesarboy5,Can't Beat The First,6,13 January 2014,"Keep in mind during this review that I believe the original Kick-Ass to be a masterpiece.Getting that out of the way, this second film was very important to me. The sequel always sets the tone for the rest of the series. Empire Strikes Back established a perfect trilogy in the making. While The Matrix 2 just let everyone know that it was over. This film was in between. As you can see, I gave it an 8. I basically found it a very enjoyable and well-done film. It's way above the average in terms of everything. Yet, it just doesn't hold up to the first film. The first fell was a powerhouse. It was brilliant satire, disguised as dumb-comedy, disguised as parody. It was so long and epic and the action was unparalleled. Once again, the sequel is just entertaining. While it does touch on some interesting subjects (pressure of high school on girls) and has some good action bits.But there's Nothing beyond that. While there were some touchy moments (if a director can change your mood, you know they are doing a good job), but those moments were only possible due to relationships established in the last film. So it doesn't count for much.The first was a must-see. The second is worth checking out.",Kick-Ass 2

206,ktyson9426,It wasn't the first but it was still OK,7,5 December 2013,"I loved the first one and have been waiting for this with great anticipation! When I saw it on Comcast On-Demand I immediately rented it. Like most sequels, this wasn't as good as the first and it's hard not to make comparisons to the first movie. The first thing I noticed was the lack of a good soundtrack that went with the first movie. Scenes like Hit-Girl whooping ass to Joan Jett's ""Bad Reputation"", or the old Banana Splits song ""Tra La La"" Song totally made the first one awesome for me. The soundtrack was as important as the characters. As the movie was unfolding I kept waiting for some funny/rocking music to play. Unfortunately, I was pretty let down that they didn't spend the money to acquire some interesting/funny/rocking songs for this movie. Then the plot was sort of handicapped by the fact the characters had matured. I felt the actors all did a good job, but the built in humor that came along with an innocent naive Kick-Ass character getting his butt beat, or the irony of a 10 year old foul mouthed girl killing someone with the same zeal she would pursue a boy band with was gone. I think they spent a little to much time developing the idea of a group of super hero's and and not enough time developing Kick-Ass & Hit-Girl characters. Overall, I liked it, and I'm sure most will... It just wasn't as fresh and new as the original.",Kick-Ass 2
207,logancrane-71337,Great Ending,8,4 March 2021,"The ending to the Kick-Ass franchise is great. Aaron Taylor Johnson is just amazing in this role, he really seems sad when the character is. Though the film was not as good as the first one, it was still an absolutely fantastic movie",Kick-Ass 2
208,malaysian1789,Wonderful Sequel,8,14 August 2013,"Kick-Ass came out of nowhere in 2010 and turned out to be one the most refreshing films to be released this decade, a super-hero film that didn't hold back on language or violence, it was the antithesis to all the Marvel films being released and had a clear identity which separated it from any other film from the genre; it remains to this day the only film I've seen at the cinema that received a standing ovation from the audience afterwards. Well, three years on, the inevitable sequel hits the screens, with the added casting of Jim Carrey to the cast (who then promptly went on record to say the film was far too violent for him to promote): surely Kick-Ass 2 can't be a failure?Beginning virtually from where the last film ended, Mindy aka ''Hit- Girl'' is still recovering from the death of her father and trying to fight crime in the city dressed as a now 15 year old super-hero, along with the help of Dave, aka Kick Ass himself. However, things begin to change when Mindy promises her new foster father (played by Morris Chestnut of Boyz N the Hood fame) she'll hang up her crime-fighting boots. This leaves Kick Ass deciding to join a superhero crew of crime- fighters dedicated to making the world a better place, but also a crew who suddenly find themselves being chased by Super Villain ''Red Mist'', now known by a different,more unusual name. This film was very identical to the first instalment, but that's not a problem, it was still an excellent film, the over-the-top violence and humour consistently entertain and the plot is madcap enough to keep the audience guessing what each twist will hold. The only disappointment for me personally was that Jim Carrey was very subdued in his role and not as funny or crazy as I imagined he would be in a film of this nature. Overall, not a film for the easily offended, but a great film for the rest of us.8/10",Kick-Ass 2
209,ahassan-12342,Everything the first film wasn't,3,1 April 2016,"I found the first Kick-Ass to be an odd but fun film that deserved its cult classic status so I was really looking forward to its sequel. Alas, what a disappointment this is. From the moment we first hear the name of the villain, it became apparent that the film was simply trying too hard. Director Jeff Wadlow included all the violence and profanity from the first film but forgot to add any of the fun, resulting in a flat affair.The key problem was how dull it all was, in particular involving the arc of Mindy attempting to adapt to life in a new school; it all seemed too contrived. And I can't believe I'm saying this but the film misses Nicolas Cage. Jim Carrey has been cast to replace him in that big-name role but bizarrely he's barely in the film. There were just too many characters to keep track of and care about.While the first Kick Ass was a great antidote to superhero movies, this is nothing more than a terrible parody.",Kick-Ass 2
210,s-klose,Not as good as the first but still better than the rest,8,13 December 2013,"Not as great as I expected but still a pretty entertaining flick. Pretty violent. But only in a few scenes. Far less than the 1st one actually. Oh and there is a shot in this movie that looks a lot like ""Sharknado"". (don't worry, it's just a building.. but you'll know what I mean if you saw that movie). Still liked the first one better. This is also the first time I am saying this but I really missed Nic Cage. He could have maybe been a guiding character like Alec Guiness in Star Wars. I did dread the High School scenes a bit but they were also a must in the way the story develops. But still it was pretty obvious what was gonna happen in the end (of the high school scenes), which I am still not gonna tell. Is it still a blind buy? Hell to the yes!",Kick-Ass 2
211,jessicareid,Loved the first one and this is better,9,18 August 2013,I really enjoyed the first Kick-Ass and I thought this sequel was even better. In this one Kick-Ass has already been well established as a superhero and he returns to the scene and teams up with other like minded people. The other characters who were inspired to become vigilantes were all interesting and some very comical. Hit-Girl was also great in this film as she was in the first and it was interesting to see more depth to her character.This film had a great combination of comedy and action throughout. There were a lot of funny moments and yet there was also a lot of serious action and some of it was quite gory. Some people might be put off thinking that this would be geeky because of the comic book theme but anyone who enjoys actions films should give this a try. Also there is quite a lot of violence in this which might not be expected because it's a comedy but there is also a serious element in it.,Kick-Ass 2
212,btnthx,Not as kick ass as the first,5,15 August 2013,"In 2010 a movie came out that instantly became one of those ""have you seen it"" movies. It was easy to lose for most people, because it was another movie based off a comic book. It was not like most comic book movies, well maybe a little like Batman, only if he was in high school and had no money, wait that's Spider-Man. Anyway ""Kick Ass"" was about a regular teenager who wanted to fight crime. No special powers, just a green scuba suit, a couple batons and a can do attitude.The reason ""Kick Ass"" was so fun, was because it combined action and comedy and did it in the right way, mostly due to director Matthew Vaughn. Sometimes capturing lighting in a bottle twice can be a hard thing to do, and not many movies franchises have pulled it off. David Lizewski/Kick-Ass (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) doesn't wear his Kick Ass costume to often anymore. He has just become your average high school senior trying to figure out his life. Meanwhile Mindy/Hit-Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) knows what she wants to do with her life, that is continue what her and her father did before his untimely death. Kick-Ass decides he wants to get back to being a super hero and starts to train with Hit- Girl, so that they can become the new dynamic duo. Kick-Ass soon finds other guys like himself, who wear a costume to help keep the streets clean. Chris D'Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) still wants revenge on Kick-Ass for blowing up his father with a bazooka. So D'Amico forms a group of bad guys, which sets up the ultimate good vs. evil battle royale.""Kick-Ass 2"" will be enjoyed by a certain group of people. The kind that enjoy over the top violence and of course the comic book series itself. While not as good as the first one, ""Kick-Ass 2"" has enough good moments to make the movie still fun. Gone is Matthew Vaughn, who did such a great job with the first film. He is replaced by Jeff Wadlow, who does not quite live up to Vaughn's shadow. While ""Kick-Ass"" relied on humor just as much as action, Wadlow, ups the action and cuts back on the laughs. In fact most of what laughs are generated are provided by Mintz-Plasse. The Flow of the movie gets thrown off a little as Hit-Girl tries to fit in at school and is taken in by the ""cool"" girls, who of course only try and embarrass her. The best part of the film, are the fight scenes, which get more elaborate as the movie progresses. ""Kick-Ass"" was one of those movies that I would have been happy with just the one. I think just because something is popular, you don't always have to make another. With that said, ""Kick-Ass 2"" is a good movie on its own, but just doesn't kick as much ass as the original.Brian Taylorhttp://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/",Kick-Ass 2
213,g-leno,Complete and utter excellence,9,26 August 2013,"I had heard a lot of bad things about this before i went in to see it, but I loved the first film, so I was never not going to see this. All the bad comments that i have heard have come from people who either haven't seen the original or are over 50 years old with little to connect them with the characters or the whole super hero genre.I thought that this was a fantastically fun and imaginative story, with humor coming from both genre related in-jokes and gross out visual violence. Perfect casting in Jim Carrey and John Leguizamo. Chloe Grace Moretz Continues to shine as Hit Girl and steals the show in most scenes that she is in. Olga Kurkulina is genuinely and terrifyingly believable as Mother Russia.This was the most fun I've had at the movies for a couple of years, and anyone who enjoyed the first film should love this. I really hope that Kick-ass 3 gets made as there are a lot of tantalizing bits that leave you wondering what may happen in a future sequel. My only criticism would be that I think it should have been rated 18 rather than 15 due to the very graphic violence and disturbing scenes.All in all: A must see!",Kick-Ass 2
214,BlairMcLovin,uneven depictions of violence and crass humor stifle an otherwise competent film,5,26 August 2013,"Jim Carrey's choice to forgo promoting this film in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre is pretty odd from where I'm sitting, he knew what the film would involve as far as the script was concerned so for him to have a spiritual realisation this far into the production process seems just plain rude.I think it was in Mark Millar's response to these problems that he mentioned Kick Ass actually focuses on the after effects of violence and doesn't fetishize it. I'd almost be willing to agree with Millar as although we aren't privy to the presumed months of rehabilitation the film implies the violence is often shown as brutal and painful even if the major players' bruises heal after two scenes. But where the film likes to hide behind this veil of superiority is the truth that as it's packed with so much of this action and displays it as a source of humour (a scene involving a lawnmower comes to mind) it really does revel in the pain inflicted upon the characters.Violence aside, Kick-Ass 2 efficiently moves from one set piece to the next without giving you time to stop and consider whether you're bored (which I guess is good) and provides about as good of an extension to these characters that can be expected after the original film. But where I sometimes enjoyed the originality on display it was brought down by the humor, violence and sex that seemed to come less from necessity to the story but rather a marketing requirement aimed squarely at the teenage male demographic.But these problems are fleeting and usually an aside to a story about revenge (I guess) and hit girls coming of age that is fairly involving and worthy of the ticket price. Go see this movie if you're feasting for some comic-booky action that isn't restrained by the MA15+ classification coupled with some self-awareness, but don't expect it to rise above any cultural trappings of what is presumed teenagers find entertaining.",Kick-Ass 2

Performances--- The lead cast tries to hard to do justice with their roles but script doesn't offer much for them. The real problem with this sequel is the script .The story has more violence and gore than the prequel. In one scene a criminal got killed ,in another the hero's dad got killed. For a second you think you're not watching an action comedy but you're watching a revenge drama. Even villain the Motherf*cker (Red Myst) has not much to do except only shrieking on his goons.The jokes have less humour, actually they are senseless. Jim Carrey's character is meaningless and is overshadowed by kick-ass.The ending is inspired from The Dark Knight (2008) where Mindy is going on her bike so fast. Do not waste your money, in buying a DVD, for this one .But, if you still want to watch it then watch this on Star Movies or on HBO.",Kick-Ass 2
218,mrwickedproductions,Just stick to the first one,3,28 August 2013,"""Try to have fun. Otherwise, what's the point?""Kick-Ass was one of the most fun movies to watch in 2010. It's innovative, hilarious, and memorable. The characters are interesting, and the story makes sense despite the outlandish subject of real life superheroes. I thought, judging from the first movie, that the sequel would be on par (if not better). However, I was utterly disappointed and embarrassed at what Kick-Ass 2 had to offer. The sequel is lost in its recycled story that has very little reasoning, and the characters seem confused as to what really needs to be done. Yet, the faults do not lie with the actors – they obviously did the best they could with such a nonsensical script.Right from the start of the movie, Kick-Ass (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) fumbles back to square one, wondering if he can really be a superhero. I felt as though this dilemma of ""where do I truly belong"" was already solved in the first movie when Dave took up the suit, gained comrades, and defeated the evil mob boss. But even after all that, Dave spends the entirety of the second movie deciding whether or not being a hero is his true calling. Hit-Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) goes through a similar identity crisis even though it's pretty clear that she was born to fight. Her adventures of trying to fit into high school makes the film feel as though it is targeted for a younger audience despite what the R rating implies.Jim Carrey's inclusion as Colonel Stars and Stripes was (a waste and) pitiful to watch. He only has about 7-8 minutes of screen time; however, the audience is expected to feel connected to his character. That's especially difficult to do, considering not much character development occurs within that small time frame. And besides, the Colonel's purpose in the film is to primarily instigate violence. Most of the movie focuses around shameless violence and comical gore, which is definitely a step down from the previous film's suspenseful action sequences.Also, the movie dishes out lame racial jokes so freely, that it almost seems ignorant of how the minorities are being negatively portrayed. Asian characters with Korean last names speak an entirely different Asian language. If movies are going to castrate minorities and use them as punching bags, they might as well do it right.It's fairly easy to see where the drop in quality from the first to the second movie originates from. Matthew Vaughn directed the first film, while Jeff Wadlow directed the sequel. Vaughn is responsible for other successes such as Stardust, Layer Cake, and X-men: First Class. Wadlow on the other hand, made movies such as Cry_Wolf and Never Back Down, which have received terrible ratings. If Vaughn directed Kick-Ass 2, I feel like it would have been on a completely different level.So overall, Jim Carrey was right. I should have took his withdrawal of support as a warning, but my thirst for a potentially entertaining sequel blinded me. You know a movie is bad when it tries to make rape funny or if it finds the need to show girls puking and defecating uncontrollably. Those are the complete opposite of comical. It's a shame, really. While belonging to a well known franchise and containing talented actors, Kick-Ass 2 could have been a contender instead of a pointless movie, which is what it is.",Kick-Ass 2
219,ninetails888,You Can't Fight Your Destiny,7,29 August 2013,"Kick-Ass 2 is the sequel to the 2010 film, ""Kick-Ass"" which just happens to be one of my favorite films. It was original, hilarious, filled with heart and many, many well-choreographed and intense fight scenes.Jeff Wadlow was a risky choice for a director but Matthew Vaugh had faith in him. I think that they could have gone with somebody better and I think at the end, he deviated too far from the comic. I know that he tried to keep room for a third film but if that never happened, he wanted to try and finish off the series but the way he did it, it just didn't really work. I didn't like the way they concluded Hit-Girl's character and Wadlow made her seem very weak and Hit-Girl is supposed to be more of a mega-hero who can do anything and he made her seem too weak. Also, what happens with her at the end isn't very satisfying. All of the fight scenes are done very well but they lack some of the style that was given by Vaugh to the first film. These battle scenes seem less stylized and more gritty. The best fight scene was probably with Hit-Girl on top of the van, shooting the people who have kidnapped Kick-Ass. It wasn't as great as the corridor shootout in the first film or the scene in which Big Daddy gives Hit-Girl instructions in taking down Frank D'Amico's men in order to save him but it was still well done. Hit-Girl stole the show from Nic Cage who was a crime-fighting vigilante. That's hard to do and in it, Chloe Grace Moretz also proved her acting ability. She has gone on to star in films by Martin Scorsese, Tim Burton and Drew Barrymore. She's great in this and once again, proves she is one of the best young actresses out there. It doesn't necessarily match the originality of the original but it's a very fun time and Chloe Grace Moretz gives an all-star performance.

220,attilabarcellos,Watch until the end of the credits,6,3 October 2013,"I'll try to go direct to the point. The first is far better than the sequel. Sometimes the movie is very boring and lack depth, and I felt like kick-ass was ""downgraded"" and became a dumb and coward nerd teenager again, like he was at the first movie, and that director's choice is one of the major reasons for this ""low"" rating to a sequence of a very good movie.Some acting is worth commenting though: Jim Carrey, John Leguizamo, Chrisptopher Mintz and obviously Chloe Grace are very good in their roles. The movie becomes better near the end, but better is not good as expected. Nevertheless, there are some pearls of wisdom here and there and one occurs near the end, so pay attention when watching the movie for them.After all, some surprises (again) near the end make the movie worth watching, so in my opinion they really tried to create a ""crescendo"", and we can say they failed even though they succeeded because the final is good, but maybe just because the rest of movie isn't so good as expected. Don't get me wrong, watch the movie, because it seems there's something more (and better) coming in the future.",Kick-Ass 2

But, this movie just falls so flat trying to get in all the ""teen girl"" problems and leaves out the Hit Girl ruthlessness and exciting fight scenes, I was left empty. It is just sad. The story is about how kids who want to change thing for the better put their lives on the line to make it happen. Instead, most of the movie is all about the social pressure facing kids in school these days.Also, they way overloaded with the good heroes v the bad villains. It was more like Braveheart than a few successful kids step up and change the world for better.The uber villain was not scary- just nuts. His assembly of minions just motivated by money and not that bad or so bad as to be unbelievable in the extreme.And Mindy/HitGirl was just not that powerful anymore. Like Puff the Magic Dragon losing his scales- just plain sad. ""Oh, I'm grounded- sorry, I can't come out to save the city."" No way Hit girl would go that way- She's much more committed to her Hit girl mantra. Sad, sad, sad. I wanted this franchise to succeed as I am a huge fan. But, now, I can only hope the producers/powers-that-be learned a lesson. Sadly, this movie sucks. And I really, really wanted it to be a good money maker because I wanted more.

I rate this movie 7.1 because of the cinematography, the effort and the Effects. I like the bloody squirting effects and some rants that they use in the movie, hence this movie is for mature only.

It even throws in a few dark moments that really help progress the plot and give The Motherf*cker some credibility as a super-villain. My only regret is that Jim Carey has such limited screen time. He really does just own every scene he is in and provides some of the film's funniest moments. Should you watch this film? Yes, yes you should you handsome son of a gun.

229,shauni15,a disastrous sequel that should never have been made.,4,9 November 2013,"Kick-ass 2 is a mess, there's no better word for it. the fact that director Matthew Vaughn didn't make this shows at every scene.Remember the originality? the witty dialogue? the gleeful violence? the great acting? well none of that's here(well maybe except for carrey and moretz) what's left is a movie filled with teenage melodrama, toilet humor, forced dialogue, and completely serious and unfitting violence. The film cant decide whether it wants to be funny or serious and instead of blending the two like in the first one. it creates scenes that are so totally different from one another and not fit together at all, it makes the movie a big cluster of random scenes that don't make sense most of the time.the acting is wooden at best(carrey and moretz manage to put some soul into their characters but sadly we don't get enough of them), Christopher Mintz-Plasse as the villain ""motherfucker"" made me cringe with every line he uttered, the entire supporting cast performs like they're reading the lines, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as ""kick-ass"" got way worse compared to the first one.And the worst part is, that it follows one of the best and most original comic-book movies to date, if it wasn't a sequel to kick-ass just a random blockbuster i would've shrugged it off as another okay action flick.

231,rockchester,Good film overall,7,3 August 2014,"Kick Ass 2 is a pretty good sequel, as sequels go. It's obvious from the start, though, that it isn't nearly as good as the original. Of course, that's true of most sequels. I've seen R.I.P.D., another movie I like, referred to as a rip-off of Men In Black. If that's fair game, then it's also fair to say that Kick Ass 2 is a rip-off of Mystery Men. That is, lots of ordinary folks who dress up like super heroes and try, in a vigilante sort of way, to fight crime and general bad behavior together. The rip-offs are, at least to me, inconsequential. Meaning that it doesn't bother me but it's worth noting nevertheless.The movie is entertaining although not consistently so. It gets a wee bit boring here and there. There is also a certain amount of predictability. Hit Girl facing off with Mother Russia in the finale, you could see it coming fairly earlier on. But, it was something to look forward to. Chloe is endlessly fun to watch as Hit Girl. And, the fact that she's turning in to a beautiful young woman makes the movie more interesting. She's certainly the star of this particular movie (as well as the original) and I can see the franchise morphing in to Hit Girl movies. She's managed to steal the show from big names like Cage and Carrey and Leguizamo already.The basic plot is that Kick Ass has inspired many others to pursue a life of donning costumes and crime-stopping. Hit Girl promises her guardian Marcus that she won't be Hit Girl any longer so Kick Ass is left by himself but she recommends he join a team which he does. The leader of the team is played surprisingly well by Jim Carrey who embraced the chameleon quality of good actors and literally disappeared in to the part so effectively that I couldn't tell that it was him until he got unmasked.But there's trouble brewing on the horizon. Chris D'Amico, the son of the big bad guy who ate a bazooka round at the end of the first movie, has vowed revenge on Kick Ass. Of course, his mom got rid of his Red Mist costume and when he inadvertently kills her, he assumes a new identity using her leather BDSM gear and calling himself, well, look it up but it's pretty hilarious in a dark way. He then uses his family's ill-gotten fortune to enlist a team of really evil henchmen. And there you have it, good versus evil with the perfunctory epic battle at the end.In my opinion, John Leguizamo was sort of wasted in this film. They killed him off way too soon. But Mother Russia was almost as much fun as Hit Girl to watch and the two doing battle was pretty good but not as much fun as it could have been.Naturally, you don't want to watch this one with the kids. There's just too much violence and foul language and the humor is entirely adult but it's almost as much fun as the first movie and that makes it worthwhile. After all, the moral of the story is that you must keep your promises but you also have to be true to yourself.",Kick-Ass 2
232,pongigmon,Quality sequel live up to the Kick-Ass standard,7,16 August 2013,"After the triumphant success of the first Kick-Ass movie, I have to say I had anticipated the sequel for this unorthodox superhero based film for quite a while. If you have seen the first one already, you would expect vast amounts of humor, action and ups and lows in it, and it didn't disappoint. As Matthew Vaughn, the director of the previous one moved on to the producer seat of the sequel, the style of the film, the laughter it brings to the audience and the viciousness of the fighting is still there.One of the key driving forces to pleasure the audience of Kick-Ass that is indifferent to any other masked vigilante films is the linkage to reality brought to the film. Even though other superheroes such as Spiderman and the Hulk possess far greater strengths than Kick-Ass and his fellow partners, it's the realism and the consequences live up to being a superhero in the real world which gives a new dynamic to this type of films. As you'd probably known, Kick-Ass didn't really possess any super power nor economic power rather being nothing more than an ordinary wuss at high school. The consequence he has to live with is to get beaten up and got his partners dragged into mayhem. It was the connection between the actors, the bond between Hit-Girl and Big-Daddy that add sensitivity to the previous one.In the new one, obviously Big-Daddy played by Nicolas Cage is deceased but there're always flash back and linkage to the last movie. The opening scene with Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Dave Lizewski wearing a bulletproof vest and practiced getting shot by another protagonist – Chloe Grace Moretz as Mindy Macready has reminisce the bonding and a great reminder of Big Daddy's wish to protect the city free of street thugs, mobs and pedophiles' criminal activities and which is why Kick- Ass and Hit-Girl duo is not adequate for the task. Hence, the quest to fight for justice and a bigger network of these guardians has set a bigger scale for the film.Every Superhero films always need a good old-fashioned villain, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse is the first world super villain which again didn't disappoint with his sense of humor and series of outrageous act which has lightened the scene up. The portrayal of him search for vengeance for his father and on the other hand, Kick-Ass who try to protect the ones he cares. The opposite force has encounter gives a tremendous ridge to the story.Overall, the film is not a bad effort for the sequel after a truly remarkable first one. The great things you expect, the giggling, action packed, bonding between characters and violence, is still there. If you're looking for a thrilling experience at a cinema, that's the one to watch!",Kick-Ass 2
233,UnsustaiNiNable,"This movie, despite the criticism, is more a hit than a miss!",7,20 August 2013,"There's not much to say about this movie. It brings just what it promises: violence (not too gory tough, so I don't really get all the hate for the so-called ""extremely bloody violence"" in this movie, because we only see a little bit of blood here and there), pervasive humor and alternation between a light and a dark tone throughout. So basically it's just like the first movie, only with more heart and action. But then why is it just a 7 out of 10, while the first one was easily a 9 out of 10? I don't really know, it's a psychological thing I guess. The first one was fresh, new, controversial. This one is nothing but a copy of that, but with more of everything.

234,Lyra-gp,Kick M-Ass-terpiece,10,15 August 2013,"There are so many things I'd like to say about this movie that I'm finding it difficult to choose what to begin this review with. Let's start saying that Kick-Ass is my favourite movie ever. A precious jewel of wit and originality, like no other movies. So I was truly worried, I feared that this sequel would disappoint me. Well, I've just come back from theatre and I'm right now feeling the need to review this M-Ass-terpiece before going to bed. Because Kick-Ass 2 is the main reason why I'm freaking enthusiast with life, now. How could I sum up the whole movie experience? Let's see...to put it in a simple way, Kick- Ass 2 is a dark, ingenious, freaking cinematographic extravaganza. I've seen lots and lots of movies this year, but none of them has stricken my heart so deeply like Kick-Ass 2 did. It's funny, dark, violent, vulgar, moving, surprising. Am I exaggerating, maybe? I can assure you I'm not. Because every freaking minute of this movie touches the chords of your heart and your sensibility in a great way. Mattew Vaughn was right when he said that the Kick-Ass sequel was in good hands. I personally loved some of his works, Cry Wolf above all, and I was very curious to see what he was able to do. KA 2 is his first super-hero comic movie and, despite the fact that he hadn't experienced this movie field before, he did a very good job. If you're reading this review, Jeff, I want you to know that I am very glad you directed this movie. With his direction, the Kick- Ass atmosphere, differently from what some people might say, remains totally unaltered. This is just one reason why I think KA 2 is a worthy and deserving sequel.In my opinion, Kick Ass represents one of the rare cases in which a movie is better than the comic it is inspired from. Sorry for Millar, but I found the KA 2 movie far more original and ingenious than the comic. It tells, more or less, the same story of the comic, but in a better way. This is due, above all, to Jeff Wadlow's script-writing efforts. Furthermore, the most violent and disturbing things about the comic have been left out, but, in return, the story is more gripping and the characters are very well developed. As I said before, the characters in the movie present very deep psychological traits. Aaron Johnson, Chloe Moretz, Jim Carrey and, last but not least, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, they all did a great job. Their interpretations in the movie are superb, providing the watcher with a very convincing and fascinating portrayal of the characters. As the movie goes by, you get truly fond of all the characters, even of the MF'ER!!! But I won't spoil anything about it, so go to see the movie. Kick-Ass 2 is going to be a cult. The movie talks about life, weaknesses, strength, love, in a totally new and different way. It's a beautiful stream of emotions that takes you away. In a 103 minutes run-time you take at heart the noble goals of the Justice Forever, you fall in love with hit-girl, you get to hate (and love) a wicked enemy, you really understand what being an adolescent means. I loved Kick-Ass 2. Is, without any doubt, the best movie I've seen this year, one of the best movies I've seen in my entire life. Go to see it, you will not regret it.",Kick-Ass 2

Honestly I blame the critics for not knowing how to have a hell of a fun time at the theater. I mean come on a 23 on rotten tomatoes, it at least deserves 60-80 but no it's to violent and over the top according to some of the critics reviews. Come on when a films name is kick ass there is going to be very violent material, heck even the first was more violent and it has a 70 something. I mean I know there is a recent amount of high violence these days but this is for entertainment only. Any way the only problem I found with this film is that some of the mood changes did not work so well but that's minor. I found this film to be funny as hell, serious and dark as hell, and entertaining as hell. Honestly I would see it twice and I felt it was a bit better than the first. I wish it was 25 minutes longer though since with the way the box office is going I don't think there will be a third... But then again it's budget was 29 mil and it mad almost 14 of that.

236,darrenandgwen-661-168573,The odds were always against them.,5,25 March 2014,"Kick Ass was a shocking, surprising and fresh twist on the Superhero genre. It's success was in part based on the small scale of the story and that after decades of super heroics on film it was completely new. As a result any sequel was always going to be difficult to make. The shock and surprise was gone, the expectation was for something just as amazing as the original. It was an impossible challenge and so the writer chose a different direction. The story has gotten bigger; while Kick Ass and Hit Girl are trying to live normal lives, their antics have inspired a new generation of costumed heroes. For the most part the heroes are victims or relatives of victims of crime, trying to stop muggings, bag snatches, making sure drunk girls get home safely. There are no super villains because in the real world they wouldn't work. It is the return of Red Mist in his new role as the revenge obsessed Mother F###ker that drives the plot and sadly kills it. While he uses his wealth to assemble an army of villains to exact his revenge the plot reruns the lessons of the first about consequences for friends and family and climaxes in a colourful but flat mass hero/villain battle. The 'real life' heroics established in the first are thrown out of the window for the second and while there are real moments of character development and relationships overall it is as two dimensional an affair as its printed origins. If this wasn't Kick Ass then it would have been a better movie but simply because it is a sequel to a film impossible to duplicate it falls flat.",Kick-Ass 2
237,falcolnpunch,Suck-Ass 2,5,15 August 2013,"When the first Kick-Ass hit our cinemas we were astounded at both how brilliantly simple an idea it was and how it had never been done before. It waltzed in with this robust cocksure approach, that hadn't been done properly since at least the 90's. It moved with this swagger as it happily let little girls decapitate drug dealers whilst setting others on fire and it's a shame Kick-Ass was so good, because the sequel is then solely based on topping it. Like many others, Kick-Ass 2 does not manage that feat.Kick-Ass 2 comes in years after the first and there have been many superhero movies in between: Some better than others. And Kick-Ass 2 doesn't really quite fit in to either category. What we loved about the first was how sure of itself it was, proud of its own violence and clever crudeness, and K-A 2 comes in, doing pretty much the same, just... again. And it feels a little tired. It's not unwelcome, it's just that it doesn't seem to have many new tricks up its sleeve that's all.The story picks up with our titular hero Dave (Taylor-Johnson) has retired prematurely from the superhero business, whereas other self-made heroes have decided to step in. Our other hero Hit Girl (Moretz) is struggling to adjust to her life dealing with foster carer, Marcus (Morris Chestnut, underused again), as he doesn't agree with her going out and murdering people. At the same time, she must try and fit in with the girls at school, who she'll find are probably even more evil than any sociopath she's had to deal with as Hit Girl.These characters are as fantastically reliable as ever; they're strong, layered characters who we know and like already from the first, without particularly changing. On the other hand, we have baddie Chris D'Amico (Mintz-Plasse) formally Red Mist, now the MotherfuXXer. Before, he was this needy, spoiled child, trying to live up to his father, whereas now he's just this over the top, poorly written bad guy. It's a shame, actually to see him so two dimensional. At the same time, things seem to happen just by accident in this movie. People die ridiculously, one death coming straight from one of the Final Destination movies. The reason for this one can only assume is the change of writer. The brilliant Jane Goldman out, which seems a preposterous move.This review is sounding very negative though, and it's certainly not all bad. Hats off to the casting in this: Andy Nyman and Donald Faison (Faison plays a character who goes by the title ""Doctor Gravity"", a clever little wink which Scrubs fans should eat up) are both great choices as baddie and goodie respectively, which can only bring me to Jim Carrey. Jim Carrey is brilliant in this film, almost unrecognisable in his battle scars face makeup and heavy voice as Colonel Stars and Stripes. He acts as this sequels equivalent of the firsts Nicolas Cage. He probably doesn't leave quite the lasting impression as Cage's Big Daddy, but that's probably down to him simply not getting as much screen-time in this film. All the same, Colonel Stars and Stripes is full of great lines (""You've got a dog on your balls"") and is still a very memorable character who I'm sure will be in popular culture for a good while.While these are good, other superheroes are not. Yes, these characters are supposed to be makeshift, but some are just unneeded: A couple deciding to dress up like super heroes to raise awareness for their lost son are completely pointless, which can also be said for Dave's Other Friend and at least one of the people on the team of Bad Guy's too. This film is stuffed to breaking point full of super characters, and it reminds us of X-men: The Last Stand, as it throws unwanted people at you while not caring for some of the characters that actually deserve it - Too much screen time for some, not enough for others. Overall, it's a fun film with a lot to like, but with lots of average characters, some of it being far too sloppy in places, there's lots to dislike too. But as the Colonel would say: ""Try to have fun, otherwise what's the point?"". Wise words. @JonnyJonJon1",Kick-Ass 2
238,williamel1986,It.... well........ Kicked Ass,8,5 December 2013,"Despite being a fan of the first movie, a fan of the comic books and a fan of Chloë Grace Moretz, it took me a long time to sit down and give Kick Ass Two the attention it deserved.... until tonight!Let me start off by saying i really enjoy Kick Ass..... I thought it was something fresh to the comic book movie craze that has swept the world so i was pretty excited when i seen the sequel had been green lit and even MORE excited when it was announced that Jim Carrey and Donald Faison were joining the cast but somehow over the long summer and the moving house i didn't get myself to the Cinema to see it (Sorry Box Office People). So i eventually picked it up on DVD.The story picks up a little time after the first movie. Kick Ass (Taylor-Johnson) has hung up the mask and Hit-Girl(Grace Moretz) is still killing bad guys like it was going out of fashion. The internet antics of Kick Ass' evens in the previous movie have sparked a huge trend of costume vigilantes all citing Kick Ass as the inspiration, leading to Dave putting the suite back on. Back too is Red Mist (Mintz-Plasse) but this time after accidentally killing his mother he has donned the persona The M0therfucker (not sure if IMDb is going to let me say M0therfucker?.... it's his name so please be nice evaluator) and has swore revenge on Kick Ass for killing his farther. In all truth IMDbers i expected this movie to be a lot funnier than it was.... don't get me wrong this movie was funny.... but i expected more humour.... instead what i found was the movie was less of a really good comedy and more of a really good comic book movie. I think that it is a perfect follow up to the original movie and a great set up for hopefully a 3rd movie to come (if you watched passed the credits you will know M0therfucker ain't dead..... if you didn't i can feel you guys stumbling for the DVD now ha ha). Kick Ass 2 stands shoulder to shoulder with other comic book movies out there.To summarise, Kick Ass 2 Kicks Ass just as much as Kick Ass! what more do you want?...................

240,antmlfc,Fun and Violence,7,14 August 2013,"For many people the first one was a bit out of the box,many thought the young star was exploited too much, well folks it is a sequel so it is worse. In the first movie there was and air of innocence about the main characters well this is thrown out the door in the first scene. The movie is full of violence, full of foul language and choc block of disturbing scenes everything that was said about the first one is doubled here it holds nothing back. The story is a revenge story but the revenge is twisted and really disturbing. The scenes involving Hit-Girl this time around are not for the faint hearted and the scenes involving The M*****F***** are disturbing but hilarious. This movie is so much fun. If you liked the first one well everything in this one is doubled as it is a sequel, but a special mention to Chloë Grace Moretz who in my opinion is a fantastic actresses every movie I have seen her in she has stole the show.

241,quicksticks,"Not as gory as the first film, with strong dramatic story line",7,9 September 2013,"Hollywood has spewed out a good few super­hero films, some of which have achieved cult status while others have had the superpowers of making audiences cringe and cause irritable bowel movements. Directors and screenwriters have stuck very closely to the source material, or have adapted their interpretation to the big screen. Either way they usually played it safe, causing audiences to love or hate the superhero genre in the motion picture format. However, in 2010, English director Matthew Vaughn (known for X-Men: First Class and Layer Cake ) broke most ""rules"" and presented one of the most pleasantly shocking ""superhero"" films, Kick-Ass. With grotesque violence, dark humour and offensive and vulgar language — which you hope that your mother never hears — Kick-Ass was the well- deserved break from the traditional superhero film. In Kick-Ass 2, a very average David Lizewski (aka Kick-Ass — played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is joined by other misfits — dressed in the most ridiculous costumes and even more bizarre names — in the quest to rid the city of crime. Hit Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz), on the other hand, has left the life of crime fighting, and now attends school like a normal child. Meanwhile, Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) takes on another persona and plots his revenge against Kick-Ass. One of the most talked-about characters in this sequel is that of Jim Carrey's Colonel Stars and Stripes. The hype is well deserved, as his character is one of the most outstanding roles in the film, delivering a great performance with some classic one-liners. If you are expecting a lot of the same material from the first film, you might be disappointed. This, however, is not a negative, as the film concentrates on the human aspect and the action takes a back seat. The fight and action set pieces aren't as strong as in the previous installment, but are certainly enough to keep audiences entertained. The film has laugh out loud, hilarious moments, but in the end it is carried along smoothly with the dramatic narrative as its backbone. Talk around the town was that Kick-Ass 2 was overboard violent, but to be totally honest, I felt that it was toned down from the carnage that was seen in the first film. The story slips from the absurd to the real, dealing with the themes of actions have consequences, being removed from your comfort zone and being true to yourself. The film does have some really powerful scenes, touching on the darker subject matter relating to the superhero genre. It is an entertaining watch with some interesting and brave ideas from the director and the source material, but ultimately a popcorn film with substance. If you haven't watched the first film, it is highly recommended that you do before seeing Kick-Ass 2, not only to get a background, but because it is a gem.",Kick-Ass 2
242,stelzon,This movie was pretty awesome. Not gonna lie...,8,15 August 2013,"I loved the first movie and really liked this one. I'm rating it an 8 just because I feel like it could have been a better movie if the characters were as serious as the story line. The movie had a lot of good laughs and I really enjoyed some of the humor in it, but the actual story and reason behind why everything happens in the movie is so much more serious compared to the jokes that the directors tried fitting into the movie. I mean, I get it, the movie's supposed to be a funny view to the life and struggles of ordinary people who want to be heroes. But if they really tried hard, this movie could of been almost as big as x-men or even the Dark Knight. Great action for what I was expecting though, and I really liked the blood involved with the humored violence. i kinda felt like I was watching a Terantino film. Must watch for sure, especially if you liked the first movie.",Kick-Ass 2
243,hsinghal1,Like it better,8,6 December 2019,I like it better than the original. I did not felt comfortable with all the killing scenes (by good guys) in the earlier movie but this movie is lot better. Shows the struggle of a misfit superhero teen to make his/her place in society and get along with life. To understand the price of becoming a masked 'vigilante'. The movie very nicely potrays the struggle of a superhero and a normal person within us.,Kick-Ass 2
244,holliemarie-h,Disappointing unlike the first - but still good fun,5,23 August 2013,"I'll be comparing this film to the first, as I feel like they took away the best elements that made 'Kick-Ass' so special! I went into this film feeling pessimistic. The trailer had disappointed me, and I strongly believed it would not be able to top the first film. When the music and Dave's Voice-over started, I felt better. It had the same feel to it, so I silently cursed myself for being so wary about seeing this movie. However, an hour in, I realised this was a VERY different film. Hit Girl is obsessed with popularity, and she's sadly absent for a lot of the action scenes in the first hour. Jim Carrey is hardly in it. They replaced the actors for Todd and Chris' mother (even though she as well is hardly in it) - a sequel should be continuous. Also Dave's girlfriend Katie is almost completely written out with hardly any explanation!The first hour falls flat on its face. We're supposed to believe that something in Chris has snapped and he becomes a psychopath who has no redeeming traits, therefore he is unlikeable and somewhat annoying during the film compared to his character in the first. There's not enough humour, and Hit Girl's story arc is basically Mean Girls. Even though we know that she could kick all their asses, she lets them ditch her in the woods and drive off? Lots of violence. The last hour was fun and things started kicking off a bit more. I loved the epic fight at the end, but it still wasn't as exciting or tense as the finale of the first film. It became predictable. Aaron Johnson's acting was still solid, Chloe Mortez really shone as Hit Girl, but not so much as Mindy. It's a fun, average movie, but my expectations were higher and they made too much effort to make it more mainstream (don't get me started on the Union J music video scene. It was horrendous.) Not the cult classic that Kick-Ass was!",Kick-Ass 2
245,goryverbinski,Kick-Ass 2? More like Suck-Ass 1,1,6 September 2013,"Offers nothing interesting, clever, exciting, or (sigh) funny. In fact this is probably the least funny superhero film I have seen in years, which was beyond surprising and insanely depressing. To be honest this movie doesn't just lack a sense of humor, but also a pulse. I can honestly think of nothing positive to say except for maybe that Jim Carrey had the good sense, or good fortune (take your pick) to enter late and exit early in what appears to be the most thankless role of his career. It wasn't that he didn't try, but that he was literally given nothing to work with. You can't poor your heart and sole into a one dimensional cameo role. Sorry Jim, you just can't. My advice to the sobs responsible behind this franchise is either bring back Matthew Vaughn to make a Hit Girl spin-off, or just let this one die and get on with your lives. Just chalk it up as an acceptable loss and just walk away before anymore damage can be done. After all, one black eye is still better than two.",Kick-Ass 2
246,hbk_nwo33,Another fun film but Kick-Ass gets lost in the shuffle,7,30 September 2013,"The strongest part of Kick Ass 2 was the story of Mindy Macready, better known to audiences as Hit-Girl. Despite reluctantly taking Dave Lizewski under her wing to train him to improve his heroics as Kick-Ass, she gives up the superhero lifestyle under the request of her new guardian Marcus (Morris Chestnut). This leads the fifteen year old into territory she finds considerably more difficult than dispatching criminals: high-school. Her struggle to fit in there is very Mean Girls but is still a good foray due to the quality of the performances of Moretz and Chestnut. Marcus was believable as the frustrated guardian who was sick of being outsmarted, or at least ignored, at every opportunity as he only wanted the best for Mindy's actual life. Unfortunately the pay-off for this storyline is weak at best, starting strong with Mindy turning up dressed up as one of the popular girls and talking about how it is nothing more than an easy disguise to be as fake as them but inexplicably and lazily falling into toilet humour to resolve her struggles thanks to ""The Sh***er"". Such a badly missed opportunity. Mindy soon reverts back to Hit-Girl to help out Kick-Ass in his battle with The Motherf****r before leaving New York for San Francisco. But before she left she planted a kiss on Dave, which is just weird because she is fifteen and their whole relationship comes across as uncomfortable for this reason.The progression of former Red Mist, Chris D'Amico, into super-villain The Motherf****r was a rocky one. It was refreshing to see such a weak and useless human being rising to such a high position simply because he is rich with the character himself even observing that he is like an anti-Bruce Wayne. His transition was helped along heavily by his own supporting cast, specifically Javier (John Leguizamo) and Mother Russia (Olga Kurkulina). Mother Russia provided a physical threat that would make Ivan Drago quake in fear, although was unfortunately dispatched easily as she simply stood still to take the glass that followed Hit-Girl's over-the-top reaction to the adrenaline injection. Javier, D'Amico's right hand man, provides the grounded voice to try and stop him from going too far because he is consumed by hatred and a thirst for revenge against his mortal enemy Kick-Ass. Within that he pointed out how ridiculous the racist names for his sidekicks were, the films self-awareness only partly excuses the material for their lame names. Javier's death at the hands of D'Amico's own uncle provided the catalyst for The Motherf****r to go full-blown super-villain. D'Amico refusing to allow Kick-Ass to save his life purely out of hatred before falling victim to his own ""lazy"" shark would have been a fitting end to the character, although thanks to a post-credits scene it turns out that he is still alive. Judging by Kick-Ass's metal helmet at the end and the lack of limbs of D'Amico, it would seem that a third film will see some cyborg heroics to send up the Iron Man area of the superhero market.The Justice Forever group was interesting, with the expectedly fun additions of Colonel Stars and Stripes and Doctor Gravity (Donald Faison). Not to mention Night-Bitch (Lindy Booth), the closest the silver screen will see to a Harley Quinn adaptation for some time and any way to see a live-action Harley Quinn is a good one. It also saw Dave's friend Marty don a suit as Battle Guy, leading to Todd attempting the same but thanks to his ridiculous levels of stupidity, that seem way too overplayed, he ends up revealing Dave's identity to The Motherf****r due to feeling left behind by his friends.Dave's life was torn apart in the film, first losing his girlfriend Katie (Lyndsy Fonseca) and later his father (Garrett M. Brown). Katie's treatment in this film is shameful, completely undoing everything about the character from the first film in her very brief appearance. Instead of the sincere character the audience and Dave got to know last time out, Katie here is a complete bitch who misreads one argument and reveals that she has been cheating on him. She was a major focus of Dave's in the first film, so for her to be brushed aside so easily and by completely destroying her character in the process didn't seem wise at all. On the flip side, Dave's father sees a good, if slightly generic, character progression. Suspecting his son's weird and unexplained behaviour to be down to drug abuse he searches his room and discovers his Kick-Ass outfit. After an argument about whether Dave should be doing it or not he moves out of home. When the police arrest all masked vigilantes Dave's father turns himself in as Kick-Ass, despite his own displeasure in his sons antics, but this results in The Motherf****r's henchmen murdering him following Todd revealing their true identities. Blaming himself and his superhero antics for his father's death Dave ends Kick-Ass but is ultimately forced back into it.Where Kick-Ass 2 is strong is in presented a plausible perspective on what a world filled with ordinary people dressing up as superheroes would result in: chaos. Things such as invading the funeral feel natural, whereas most superhero films would allow the funeral to be left in peace to just let the hero mourn but it is the perfect time for the villain to strike whilst the hero is vulnerable and unsuspecting. D'Amico purchasing a team to help his villainy due to realising his own inadequacies was smart too, as D'Amico realises that his only power is wealth and he actually capitalises on that. The notion of costumed heroes being gang-attacked for YouTube video hits seems real too, like an extreme happy-slapping phenomena.Despite providing plenty of laughs, some of the humour really is a little childish and trying too hard to be controversial, such as the previously mentioned ""Sh***er"" and the post-credits exclamation of the penis loss.",Kick-Ass 2
247,zotwot,A surprisingly good sequel,8,18 June 2014,"I went into this anxiously. I really liked the first movie but I know this didn't impress the critics and I thought the comic book was pretty rubbish. However, I was pleasantly surprised. This was quite a bit longer than the first film which meant there was much more time for comedy. I would say this is more of a comedy than an action film and it continues to be hilarious. But then it throws in the darker side and lots of violent action and it all comes together to make something rather excellent. The cast here are all superb, even if the two leads are much older than their characters. Jim Carrey is almost unrecognisable as Colonel Stars and Stripes and the rest of the supporting cast are great, such as Scrubs' Donald Faison. I also like how this stuck to the basic plot of the comic book but changed virtually everything I didn't like about it. The Kick-Ass/Hit- Girl relationship is stronger here too but then again Hit-Girl is much older in the film universe than the comics.It's perhaps not as shocking as the first film but is funnier and I consider it to be a very worthy sequel.",Kick-Ass 2

250,mcfjr42,A Solid Sequel,8,1 January 2014,"Kick-Ass 2 is one of those sequels a lot of people seem to be on the fence about; either you love it or you hate it. I suppose I'd fall into the former camp, as I found this movie to be fun and enjoyable for the most part, with some amusing moments, good performances, and action that lives up to the title. However, this movie does have a couple of problems.The first problem is the characterizations of some of the characters. Dave, for instance, becomes a jerk who incessantly badgers Hit-Girl into resuming her vigilante duties, and his girlfriend Katie shows up just long enough in the movie to dump him and call him a pedophile. This is quite a 180 in personality from the last movie, though it brings her more in-line with her portrayal in the comic (though I did prefer the movies being a separate entity from the comics). The plots whirling around involving Dave, Hit-Girl, and Chris D'Amico give the movie a sort of cluttered feel, which leads to a Pirates of the Caribbean sequel level of bloatedness.The other problem is that Jim Carrey's Colonel Stars and Stripes and John Leguizamo's Javier are a bit underutilized. Both of them are only in the movie for about ten minutes each, and that might be being generous. However, let it be noted that in their short amount of time on screen they deliver some of the best performances in the movie; Jim Carrey has a really cool action scene with some funny lines, and Leguizamo is great as the guy who looks out for Chris and puts up with his ridiculous supervillain scheme.Of course, the movie's strengths for the most part overshadow the annoyances. As stated before, Carrey and Leguizamo turn in fine performances for their limited screen time, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse manages to make Chris D'Amico stay funny and even a bit likable as he perpetrates heinous act after heinous act. Chloe Grace Moretz is, of course, fantastic, and all the new superheroes who show up are pretty fun too.And speaking of the other superheroes, they may be the coolest part of the film. The final battle, where masked heroes and masked villains clash in a battle royale of epic proportions, is infinitely superior to the final battle of the first film. This movie does stumble a bit with juggling so many plots, but in the end it's still a fun action-comedy with some great performances. I'd say it measures up to the first, or at least comes very close. It's certainly not a perfect film, but it is a fun film.",Kick-Ass 2
251,Jay-Klee,Not as good as the first.,4,24 August 2013,"I really liked the first Kick-Ass. I thought that it made some good changes to Mark Millar's graphic novel and recreated the really fun tale of regular people turned heroes. When Kick-Ass 2 was announced, I was stoked...until I found out that Matthew Vaughn was no longer going to be involved in the movie (as more than a producer). Jeff Wadlow wrote and directed the sequel, his first rated R adventure. So...did it kick ass?I'll start off my review by saying that Kick-Ass 2's story is an absolute mess. I'm familiar with the source material, and I know some liberties had to be made with the story for the screen (some of the violence in the book is disgusting), but the characters here seem like that have little to no motivation to do anything. Kick-Ass gets back into the crime fighting game...because he's bored. One of Kick-Ass's friends becomes a super hero because...it seems cool. Hit Girl gets back into the crime fighting game because...she's basically also bored. Certain characters seem completely forgotten about. This script is, simply put, a disaster.There are several really fun, really well done scenes here. The 'van' scene (hinted at in the trailer) is outstanding. Mother Russia showing the NYPD that she means business is another stand out scene. However, the rest of the movie seems entirely forgettable, with the exception of Jim Carrey's charismatic turn as Captain Stars & Stripes.The direction is competent. Wadlow lets the action breathe a bit instead of getting up close and personal with the shaky cam that I hate so much, so I did appreciate that. You can actually tell what's going on. The CGI blood is a little distracting (why don't we just use squibs anymore?). The acting is competent, although Mintz-Plasse is even more annoying here than he was in the first one.Here's my bottom line...going into Kick-Ass 2, expect the following - a terrible story, some cool action scenes, and a ton of dick jokes. Aside from a handful of scenes, this won't be a movie that you remember in a year. Hell, you may not even remember most of it as you exit the theater. It's definitely not as good as the first one.Final Score: 4/10",Kick-Ass 2
252,rudith13,Not as good as the first but pretty good.,7,28 October 2013,"I really cannot see why this was really bad. I wanted to see this so badly but nobody would recommend it. i went to see it anyway and was quite surprised. Sure, its much more vulgar than the previous one but there are way more disgusting movies than this. The only thing this film lacks is a really engaging thrill that you get from the first one. I also disliked the fake blood effects that weren't up to Kick ass standard and that Jim Carey didn't really get a bigger role for this movie considering he was on the poster. The comedy is quite good and it had some great lines in there but this movie is aiming for a more serious tone and it gets there during the second half of the movie. The Stupidity of the names really got me. ""The MotherF***er"" ""Night B**ch"" ""Battle Guy"" ""The Tumor"" and finally my personal favourite ""The Toxic MegaC**ts"". Overall, This was an effective movie and i was engaged throughout.",Kick-Ass 2
253,g-boyle3,Kicked Ass,8,20 August 2013,"My initial feeling going to watch this movie was that it would be a success, partially because I wanted it to be, and I'm glad to say that I was right. kick Ass 2 was a pleasant improvement on the 1st kick ass, which I also thoroughly enjoyed. There really wasn't a dull moment moving between many leading characters and side characters who all prevailed in having my sides aching from the violent humour or just flabbergasted from the gore. it's a very unique skill, being able to shock viewers with violence yet maintaining the funny aspect of these brutal slayings, a skill harnessed by Jeff Wadlow in kick ass 2. In this kick ass we are asked to invest more in the leading characters and find ourselves actually caring what becomes of them, hoping, praying that kick ass and hit girl escape unscathed. Another side of hit girl is revealed to us in KA2, a side that we are not too familiar with in the 1st. Her true identity Mindy Macready a would be normal teenager finding it hard adapting to normal life conflicted and torn between a childhood she missed out on and the responsibility that comes with her ever fascinating deadly combat skills; fighting crime.Christopher Mintz-Plasse stole the show as the notorious Motherf**ker unrelenting in his efforts at revenge which were hilariously pathetic and effective all at once. His ability to execute each scene with comical bravado enabled him to surpass his fellow cast members in terms of performances. Enjoyable side characters such as Clnl Stars and stripes, battle-guy, Dr Gravity and the unforgettable remembering Tommy keep us amused throughout the movie with sharp one liners and humorous stories. If you enjoyed Kick Ass I can assure you that you will not be disappointed with KA2 it has everything the prequel had to offer and more.",Kick-Ass 2
254,Supereyes206,So disappointing,1,4 October 2016,"I feel like rating this sequel a 1 might be a little too harsh, maybe a 3 or 4, but I don't want you to get me wrong, it's not a little bit good, there are some moments, but they are all very tiny. It is bad, but it's not terrible...wait, I don't want to say that it isn't terrible though which is very deserving, but it's not so terrible that it deserves such negativity. But on IMDb, ""1"" is listed as ""awful"" so I want to go with that. There are way worse films than this.I loved ""Kick-Ass"", it was and still is one of my favorite movies of all time...but this follow- up RUINED it. It didn't just ruin the first movie, it destroyed everything I LOVED about the first movie.It's so hard to go into detail and emphasize just how frustrated I am, because that was how let-down I was...I have too many strong feelings about the sequel. Kick-Ass 2 is just...a flop on so many levels. The story was incredibly uninteresting and not exciting at all. Most of the film's focus takes time on Mindy/Hit-Girl that it forgets the moral of the first movie. Mindy's character gets way more focus in the movie than the main character himself, Kick-Ass.This series went from being a hilarious comedy...to a boring-ass melodrama. This is not because I don't like drama, and I am not just all for action and gigs. Kick-Ass had a good balance with the action, comedy and drama altogether. This movie lacks everything the original was about. It forgot its moral structure and tone. There was barely any comedy in this film. This film is all about Mindy fitting in school.1 out of 10 does feel a bit strong but this film ruined everything. Andy hooks up with a new girl and breaks up with his girlfriend from the first movie as if it was nothing, when the first film was largely about the girl he loves. Unfortunately those two break up by the middle of the movie. I'm surprised she even had a role in this.This film didn't deserve to be made. In a way, it does slightly ruin my experience when I re-watch the first movie.",Kick-Ass 2
255,bozinovska_jovana,Entertaining,6,5 October 2013,"I remember when Kick-ass(2010) wasn't intended to be a popular movie and then had a lot of success because it wasn't a typical superhero movie. that's what made it so loved by the audience. I think that the first movies are always better than the sequels and I have been proved right in more than one example. It seems that when directors aren't pressured and when they don't revolve around the audience's expectation, they always make a better movie. So, my point here is that Kick-ass 2 doesn't top its predecessor. It is not very bad and disappointing, but I do have some critics and it's not my goal to make you not to want to watch this movie after reading my review. After all, it's entertaining,fast,funny and packed with action. But, here are the negative notes I made during the watching of the movie. As I mentioned before, a director seems to make a better movie without a pressure. Well in this one you can feel that the success of the previous movie was intended to be topped. I was under the impression that they wanted to make it as big as Iron Man, but failed. I would say that they followed the Hollywood recipe for a superhero movie, but tried to keep it cool,as there are no superpowers involved. More down Earth and real.that's a good thing. Now, the one thing that bothered me the most was the poor acting. Obviously the actors didn't take this movie seriously and definitely didn't bothered to give their all. I mean, Kick-ass is a great and inspiring new-era movie, but the cast made it look like another chick-flick with their unsatisfactory acting. In the first Kick-ass,the main character Dave was so much fun to watch. he was really special in a way, but in the sequel that special part was lost. Although,we can say that this movie focuses much more on the character hit-girl. there are a lot of new faces in this one which was very refreshing. It kept the story interesting. yes, as for the script, it is much more darker that the previous one. there are many deaths and the danger is on a higher level. this kick-ass is very commercial,too. It has many mentions of popular social networks, singers,actors,movies and so on. Sometimes it's great to see a connection between the world we live in with the world inside the movie, but all of this is fiction and I would have preferred if they didn't advertised so much. It takes the mind off the story line. there are some scenes that made me think: Am I really watching this? So absurd. you'll know when you see them. Very big dislike for that. Enough with the bad stuff, on the other hand I really loved the chemistry between Kick-ass and hit-girl. Like I said previously, it's not a big disappointment, it's not a total waste of time. In fact, it's fairly entertaining.",Kick-Ass 2
256,SokolSam,Decent sequel... (Spoilers),6,12 September 2013,"I liked the first movie, it brought something new to the superhero universe although I wouldn't consider it a superhero movie. That being said, the second one was simply decent. They didn't present anything new. They simply showed the struggles all the heroes had to go through with their double lives. Like I said, nothing new here. The action scenes with Hit Girl and Mother Russia were the only thing that made the movie entertaining. The death of Dave's father seemed kind of a parody. A short funeral scene and he completely forgot about, but I'm sure it was necessary to motivate him in his ""quest"" to be a hero. I didn't expect much from the first movie and it surprised me and although I saw the second one with the same thing in mind, it was simply entertaining.",Kick-Ass 2
257,axfan64,Great film except not as great as its predecessor,9,16 August 2013,"Kick-Ass 2 was definitely a film for the fans, if you aren't familiar with the Kick-Ass series then this movie wouldn't be for you. Having said that I am a fan of the comics and this movie was awesome. The fight scenes were crazy and Hit-Girl always runs the show. I hate that the critic scores are low but I honestly kind of figured they would be and I see why they made it so low, to a film's core this film wouldn't be looked at as a masterpiece, and they couldn't exactly retain the same shock factor the first one had because Hit-Girl was only 11 or 12 years old in it. But all things aside this was a pretty entertaining film and I think most people would really enjoy it.",Kick-Ass 2
258,Mr-bravestone,"Loved the First, and this Beats It!",9,27 August 2013,"What a ride! The original crew is back and now the infamous 'Hit Girl' is learning new things, not about fighting crime, but about life in general (the teenager type stuff that all highschoolers learn about) while Kick Ass is trying to become a better super Hero, it was a nice contrast that plays well throughout the film.""You only have one life to live, so live it"" forcing everyone to ""take risks"" when trying to figure out who you really are.Aside from it's violence and hilarity, the performances of the main cast were excellent, as were all of the secondary character's roles. The writing was fantastic. Just when you think you get a moment's rest, you're sucked right back into the story faced with a new dilemma whether on the streets or through their relationships.I loved the first installment of Kick Ass, and Kick Ass 2 is one of the rare films that surpasses it's predecessor. More violent and more funny, even. Well crafted in every way. PLEASE treat yourself to this.",Kick-Ass 2
259,gotton2013,All fans of Kick-ass should avoid this film like the plague,1,30 November 2013,"In March of 2010 a film by director Matthew Vaughn was released that took everybody watching it by surprise. This was a movie that people had so little faith in that it had to be independently funded and put together on a shoe string budget. This was a movie that held up a satirical mirror to a whole genre of movies and not only highlighted their weaknesses but also showed that genre how it was done. This movie was of course, Kick-Ass. On paper it was never going to work. It was a movie about some weedy teenage geek who decides to become a superhero and ends up caught in a war between another crazed costume vigilante and a whole crime family. This on its own would be a hard enough premise to sell to both investors and viewers but throw in an eleven year old crime fighting girl who basically butchers everyone she meets, it seemed impossible that it could be a good movie. But boy were we wrong. We were all made to eat our pre-judgement of that film and got to enjoy a wonderfully told, well shot and perfectly scored movie that was not just one of my favourite movies of 2010, but is genuinely one of my favourite movies ever. With that in mind it is clear why I can feel so strongly about how terrible this movie was. Jim Carrey was right to turn his back on this movie because it butchered the memory of the first movie and basically went against everything that the first Kick-Ass film stood for. The fears with the Kick-Ass story in general was that it glorified violence for little or no reason. The story and the deeper themes that run through the first movie offset that fear, this film fully realises it. There are no clever under tones, no juxtaposition for the highly choreographed violence with the scenes that highlight the gritty realism of true life. What I just witnessed was 103 minutes of bloody violence, needless vulgarities, ridiculous names taken too far and no redeeming features whatsoever. This was all violence for the sake of violence and that is not what I watch movies for. This was clearly made by people who seemed to have completely missed the point of the first movie and just wanted to make the very movie that I had presumed Kick-Ass had been made to speak against.I will stop there because I could go on for hours stating how terrible this movie ended up being. I just wish that there was some kind of erase button I could press to scrub the memory of that movie from my mind. Alas there isn't so I post this review in an effort to save you the same torment, stick with the first film which is a masterpiece and don't watch this travesty of a so called sequel.",Kick-Ass 2
260,jrtedrick,Kick-Ass 2: A Hard Kick To Take,5,18 August 2013,"This movie is the first I've seen in theaters while attending college. I must say that, because it is most likely the only good thing I'll say about it. I went to see it with my roommates,and they all enjoyed the film. Fair enough. However, while they spent their experience in full entertainment, I was, unfortunately, less than impressed. I will admit, there were moments in the film that made me laugh. Heartily, in fact. But that goes to one of my biggest problems with the film; its inconsistency. There are times where it seems to want to be violent and crass, but the sort that is in enough good humor that you can forgive and enjoy (like The Evil Dead 2). For the first half of the film, you get some of that humor and quirkiness (particularly when the protagonist joins a ragtag crue of heroes led by the great Jim Carrey's character). Then, somewhere along the line, it falters, then crashes, then burns. The film loses much of its humor, turning into a nasty, gruesome piece of work. Violent and crass, of the violent and crass sort. Speaking of violence and vulgarity, if you are a parent reading this, I would strongly advise against showing this to your kids. It's a double-lose; not only would you be showing them something far inferior to recent Marvel and DC, but you'd also be subjecting them to the grungiest in grisly ""superhero"" violence. I knew going in that the film was likely quite gruesome (I saw Watchmen,which this film often has shines of). However, I was still pretty well sickened by just how gratuitous, oppressive, and, most of all, pointless the violence and murder really was. It's to the level where you see it, in the theater, and all you can wonder is ""why""? Is this much meaningless, uncomfortable violence really necessary? The answer, of course, is no. It's violence for the sake of violence, and frankly, I found it hard to take. Still, if you want to see this film, for some reason, there are some funny moments,quirky characters, and other little bits to enjoy. However, the overall experience is difficult to fully enjoy. A bitter pill to swallow, a hard kick to take.",Kick-Ass 2
261,jquirke-587-970468,Such a Let Down,5,17 November 2020,"Because of where it's come from I can't forgive this movie for what's it's done. Kick Ass was exceptional, Kick Ass 2 was exponentially poor. From start to finish it tried and failed. Littered with poorly delivery clichés it was a betrayal of its original movie in so many ways.
There's only some continuity with the characters and where they we're at at the end of Kick-Ass. Hit Girls grown up way too fast while everyone else hasn't grown up or even emotionally matured just a little bit. Some have in fact gone backwards.
After where the first movie left off it's just not believable where this one begins. Emotionally I just didn't connect with the story this time, old characters and past events are forgotten or quickly dismissed on a whim while new ones get a free pass with hardly any background or development.
It's a fiction that's ruined a fiction.",Kick-Ass 2
262,agrising,An enjoyable sequel,7,20 August 2013,"As someone who more or less worships the genius behind the first Kick-Ass film, I was disappointed at the first trailer released for the sequel. A lot of the heart appeared to be gone and replaced with a simple plot and forced villain. All worries aside, I went to go see this film after hearing very positive reviews from online users and friends. The verdict: a good sequel that either stands next to the original in the eyes of some...or behind it in those of others.Kick-Ass 2 more or less borrows from the first film, both for the better and for the worse. While the tone is kept consistent from the first movie (constant foul language, cartoon bloody violence, over the top sex references), it feels that this film tried to hard to be a comedy. The first film, in my opinion, did an excellent job at satiring the superhero genre and entertaining its audience. While the sequel entertains, it feels rather lackluster, and relies heavily on its third act to make us care for all that has been happening for the last hour.The movie kicks off great, reminding us that we are back in the universe of the Kick-Ass comic book and a great follow up to the original. After a few minutes, however, steam is lost. Katie's character is ruined for no reason, making her completely incoherent with the first film and ruining her character as a whole. We get a lot of the ""high school"" and ""mean girls"" from Mindy's storyline, with not much for us to care about and just placed here to fill in screen time and pretend to give us insight into Mindy's character that we already know, she loves being hit girl! Chris D'Amico's character has so much screen time and yet...we never really understand why he wants to become a villain. The trailer says it all, Kick-Ass killed his father. Other than that, all the screen time we get from here feels rather weak. The first hour was decent, but the second one kicks it into gear and we get everything the trailers let us to believe the movie was. Without saying much else, the movie has an enjoyable climax and ties all lose ends as best as possible. I enjoyed the ending, Jim Carrey's character was great, the laughs came often, they were decent emotional moments, the violence was just as constant as in the first movie, and overall an enjoyable follow up to the first film. However, it did not try hard enough to improve on its predecessor and settled to just to satisfy your average audience. If you're a Kick-Ass fan, give Kick-Ass 2 a go. It stands right behind it, but don't go in expecting everything that made the first movie such a pleasure for critics and the casual viewers alike. I will always worship Kick-Ass for the smart movie it was, Kick-Ass 2 gets the same credit, but sadly, the first film still holds my heart.",Kick-Ass 2
263,Scottfarmer778,Great Second Film! - Must Stay Till After Credits,9,26 August 2013,"Kick-ass 2 is a great follow up to the original! This film is once again action packed and is packed full of violent fighting, killing and other exciting things that they have managed to pump into the film!The film is very graphical at points, personally I feel this only engages the audience into the film that bit more.Throughout the film things happen that I didn't expect, which makes the film much better in my eyes!Don't want to tell anyone anything too much as you wont appreciate the film as much! Defiantly watch this however!AND STAY BEHIND FOR 5 MINS! AFTER THE CREDITS IS A 30SECOND CLIP WHICH MAY CHANGE THE WAY YOU SEE THE ENDING!EXCITING HEH!",Kick-Ass 2
264,Scene13,It Kicked Ass - Don't Believe The Critics,8,15 August 2013,"Kick Ass 2 and its predecessor Kick Ass are a breathe of fresh air in a time of over done super hero films. The success of these films should be a message to the bigger budget film companies to mix it up and stop remaking the same old super heroes in the same old way. I really wanted this film to be a good, solid sequel that was as good, if not better then the first film. I was not disappointed Kick Ass 2, Kicked ASS!!Kick Ass 2 follows on from the first Kick Ass film and a craze of ""everyday people"" Super Hereos are walking the streets trying to make the world a better place. But what is the use of all these super heroes if there isn't a super villain to defend the world against. Enter Red Mist... i mean The Mother Focker, the new alter-ego of Chris D'Amico who is on a mission for revenge and the demise of Kick Ass. Interweaved between this story is a story of identity we find Kickass and HitGirl trying to define themselves which leaves them both going separate ways one throwing themselves into the super hero lifestyle while the other walks away from it, seeking a normal life.(6) Likes and (1) Dislike are listed below:Likes 1) The New Hereos: Dr Gravity (Donald Faison), Battle Guy (Clark Duke), Night Bit-ch (Lindy Booth), Insect Man (Robert Emms) and lets not forget the fantastic Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey). These heroes were fantastic, original and funny. The acting was great across the board. I was concerned that Jim Carrey might go off on one and try and steal the show (Which is fine in the right time and place), but it seems he was kept on a tight leash and he was fantastic! so do not be concerned if you are wary of Jim Carrey.2) Mother Russia: Mother Russia (Olga Kurkulina) is a fantastic character a rock solid, deadly woman. She was awesome, featuring in most of films explosive scenes.3) Fight Scenes and Gore: The fight scene choreography and the blood effects were fantastic. There was gore but it was not distracting to the plot allowing you to move on with the stories fast paced nature. Very well done. I thought the poker game fight was amazing. 4) Comic Style On Screen Writing and Character Sketches: When the members of The Motherfockers evil heroes were being introduced i thought the comic style sketches were a nice touch as well as the comic style writing in the corners. I nice reminder that this is based on a comic and fits in with the super hero genre.5) Humour: The film is true to its comedy roots and is genuinely funny. It will have you lauging. It never felt that the comedy was being forced.6) Music: The music through out the film was good. At times it even added to the humour of it all. For Example a cover version of the Tetris theme tune was playing whilst Mother Russia was ""dealing"" with the police.Dislike1) Although i realise that The Motherfockers cause was to seek revenge on Kick Ass i did feel that for a bad guy with many followers, he didn't do a lot to 1) earn the following he had gathered and 2) use the followers he had. most of the evil doings were very personal to Kick Ass and his team and therefore not have had such an impact to gaining followers that perhaps more public chaos could have had. It almost felt that he was a none issue.Overall. I thought this film was great. It Kicked Ass, in my opinion it was a great sequel and in fact i thought it was better than the original. Mainly due to there being multiple ""Super"" heroes. I do not understand why the critics have not rated this film higher. Having seen it, i cant understand what more they could've wanted. I think the viewers reviews will set the record straight. Watch it and see what you think.",Kick-Ass 2
265,maxmanthedon,Not the first one,4,3 March 2016,"Kick-Ass 2 started out promising. The story, with Hit-Girl being forced to retire and leading Kick-Ass to form his own team was a fine start. Jim Carrey was fun as Colonel Stars and Stripes, and the movie was shaping up. But from the moment Chris D'Amico arrived, he was annoying, and just got worse. Mother Russia and the other ""super villains"" were awful, and the fact that Dave's geek friends become heroes like ""Ass- Kicker"" and ""Battle-Guy"" is cheap. It was overly violent (and not in a fun way like the first one), boring at some points, and a rip-off of itself. The first one was much better. Though I would recommend it to fans of the first, if anything to finish the saga, Kick-Ass 2 was overall a disappointment.",Kick-Ass 2
266,leonkosc,"Good comedy, not so good movie.",6,25 December 2018,"I was so surprised how much I enjoyed Kick-Ass 2. I love the first one, it's one of my favourite superhero movies, it's funny, it has great action scenes, but it focuses on the characters and for me it was the thing that dissapointed me in the sequel.Like the first one it is very funny, has great fight scenes (although one battle in the middle fell to slow for me) and it works for a superhero comedy, it's better than Deadpool or LEGO Batman movie, and it's really fun.My biggest problem is the fact that Chris, a villain in this one is turned into a joke, and an idiot. Don't get me wrong, he's really funny, but in the first one he was a character, he had motivations, we could like him or feel sorry for him. Here he's an idiot and a joke, funny joke, but it's not the same.Smaller problem is the fact, that there are som plot points that just stop, or don't go anywhere, but it isn't something that bothered me that much.Overall if you're a fan of superhero movies or action comedies, you really should check it out, it's a good time, but it's not a good film.",Kick-Ass 2
267,smiley_21207,Kicks-ass Again...,7,4 October 2013,"Although I did like the 1st Kick-Ass a little better then this one, this was still a good movie. It was very enjoyable to see Chloe Grace a little more grown up & mature. Once again, her scenes were very well choreographed. Aaron Taylor-Johnson did a great job in his re-occurring role as well. I liked the way the movie began. It was a fun movie to watch and not half bad for a sequel. My only problem is that the plot got a little corny at times but I guess that's what is to be expected in a super-hero type movie. Still, it held my attention for the most part. Bottom line, Kick-Ass 2, kicked azz again...But hopefully, it will stop at this one. Lol.",Kick-Ass 2
268,rashpace40,Not up to the mark,6,31 December 2013,"The movie starts from where the first part ended.Dave is now in senior high school grade.he had the older Hit girl studying in his school.Dave never left his ambition to be a super hero.But ,Mindy the hit girl couldn't continue with her hit girl identity as she had to listen to her dear ones.The hormone changes that was happening with the Hit Girl made her to behave her like a normal teen.As Hit Girl was not able to join Kick Ass for his heroic actions,he arranged a team with the like minded citizens who were interested in becoming super heroes.Kick Ass being the first life super hero was joined in a group started by Colonel with a motto ""Justice Forever"".But at the same time an enemy group too was formed for the super villains with red Mist as their leader.The game started among them.To know the rest of that happened with these groups is the movie.Kick Ass 2 was also a good movie.But the scenes showing the girly problems of Mindy was bore at times.That made the movie slow at times.These movies are fun to watch and some sentimental scenes in this movie made it to another dimension.But in all its a watchable movie.I rate the second part with a 6/10! The third part which was rumored as the last part is to be made later.Expecting for that!! More reviews in www.movieholicviews.blogspot.com",Kick-Ass 2
269,brandonmathieu77,"Nothing is perfect, but this was fun.",9,17 August 2013,"This movie is of course going to be compared to the original Kick-Ass, and in that regard it falls just slightly short. The original was just that, original.. and that is why it still is a slight step ahead. All in all though, this movie has everything you want when you go to the theater. Parts of the movie are really dark, and will bring chills. Parts of the movie are just fun to watch, and others you are cheering for the main characters. The development of Kick-Ass himself was much needed, and what he eventually becomes will make everyone who enjoys this series excited for a Kick-Ass 3. Despite how great that was, the star of the movie was obviously Hit Girl.. she stole the show, and overshadowed everyone in each scene she was in. By the end of the movie, as some have already said, it is hard not to absolutely love her, and see her in a completely different light than the previous movie. The super villain M-Fer was also very well played, though a bit over the top even for this series at times.The deaths in the movie of some of the characters was kind of expected, and all in all didn't leave the feeling of deep loss that was there in the original with Big Daddy. Any chill bumps you feel in this one, or watery eyes, aren't from sadness as much as exhilaration.My only complaint about the entire movie was the final sequence, the big battle.. it just felt incredibly rushed. Having read the comics, I expected the build up for this and the event itself to be much more intense.All in all a great movie, and I am looking forward to catching Kick-Ass 3.",Kick-Ass 2
270,mrs-moo-dude,Takes Kick Ass to the next level!!,8,21 August 2013,"As a VERY pessimistic cinema goer who is more often than not put off by the prospect of sequels - I was left dumbfounded at how amazingly perfect this was. THIS is how you do a sequel - Kick Ass 2 is more uncompromising, more cut-throat and more serious in terms of the consequences that Dave has to face with every action he takes in his fight against The Mother F*cker and his evil forces. The whole plot of the movie shows how the three main characters have broken away from their original lifestyles all because of the events of the first film. Dave is taking his superhero lifestyle further, Mindy is trying to give it up, and Chris (MP) gives an explosive performance as Frank Damico's son who is now going slowly insane following the death of his father.Hit Girl's conflicting identity was a fantastic nod to the superhero genre - as the first sequel of any superhero movie always involves this storyline one way or another. We really see Mindy's maturity in this film, as she comes to terms with who she really is and tries to fit in to a normal environment in high school. The scenes involving Mindy and the popular girls at her school didn't take away from the experience whatsoever - I was initially worried that there was going to be gratuitous amours of ""Mean Girls"" chick flick type scenes - but the writers and the directors kept this to a minimal, and it played out very well as Chlöe Grace- Moretz displays a wonderful performance as a girl out of her natural element.The actor who replaced Marcus did an incredible job of transferring the persona from the original actor - the same cant be said for Todd's new actor unfortunately, as I really found myself hating Todd throughout the entire movie due to the actor's lack of likability. The old Todd we knew didn't exist and this new persona the actor portrayed kind of sucked to be honest. All in all, the separate storyline's of each character broke off cleanly from one another before neatly coming back together for a brutal final half of the film. Kick Ass 2 is shocking, hilarious and heart-wrenchingly gripping. So much takes place in just an hour and 45 minutes that it felt much longer, yet never once dragged.I loved Kick Ass 2. Every minute of it. And after this year's failure that was Iron Man 3, I'm glad that THIS was the film which restored my faith in the Superhero genre of film. Bring on Kick Ass 3 !!",Kick-Ass 2
271,Atlas_Redux,"Kick-Ass is back. Bigger, harder ... better? (spoiler free review)",8,23 October 2013,"There are no spoilers in this review. Hence it will also be a bit short, though, I hope it will show my opinion on the movie.So, Kick-Ass is back. The first question you should ask yourself with any movie is if it is enjoyable. Is it worth your money? For Kick-Ass 2, the answer is simply, hell yeah.Is it better than Kick-Ass 1 or even live up to it? I'd say it at least lives up to the first movie. There'sa lot of people bashing on it for not being as good as the first. It's more action-paced, more brutal. Though, I can't really say I prefer one over the other. I honestly felt the first movie to be a bit slow paced at times, but it was needed to build characters, and with such a big gallery, it was needed. In 2, the action is more rushed and it both gains and miss out on it due to this.The gallery is expanded even more. Some don't get enough buildup for climaxes, but I find it hard to complain about it, because the pace this time around is so much better.The movie flows much better than the original. You might wish for more expansion on the personal stories of each character, but no, sorry, not going to happen. The mains get more flushed out, but the rest are really basic characters. I wish Carrey's character got more attention, but as it is, it wasn't bad. Just, a little shortcoming. Overall, a great movie on its own and if this had been the first movie, I bet it would have gotten just as much attention.And for the complaints about the gore ... did you even watch the first movie? If you made the complaint about there being to much gore in this and liked the first ... just, don't ever make review ever again. You are , simply put, stupid.",Kick-Ass 2

How did they even find the goddamn hideout? This movie disappointed me so much. The chick flick part was also just horrible, especially the poop stick being the solution to it....",Kick-Ass 2

Kick Ass 2 is a hilarious, bloody piece of cinema that is great from start to end. It made me feel, it made me laugh and it made me turn away from the level of gratuitous violence shown, which was well used. I was worried that the new characters would take away the special feeling present in the first film - don't' worry, the new characters are brilliant.

Action, Funny, Dark & the most fun I've had in the theaters this summer. Something I really liked is how this once gave more reference to the comic which the original did but not as much. Kick-Ass 2 is a sequel that does justice to the original. Even though it isn't In the same level as the original, doesn't take away how much I enjoyed it & delivered.

275,litchy03,Kick ass fun,7,26 August 2013,"This film was a lot of fun, It was not as good as the original but don't let that stop you from seeing it. There was less storyline and more action which some might like and others will dislike. This showed Hit girl in a different light old enough now to make her own decisions and struggling to deal with the decisions she has made. The mother f*cker was so over the top it worked which most over the top villain's don't (example Mr freeze from Batman and Robin and anyone from Mystery men) The Russian I feel stole the show in her limited screen time. She didn't say much but her actions spoke louder than words.This is a movie worth seeing if you enjoyed the first one but in saying that there are people out there that disliked the first and enjoyed the second. If you like a good action film you will enjoy this as the action scenes in this film where really well done. If you have a spare $20 and 2 hours to kill you won't be disappointed.",Kick-Ass 2
276,edm-the_red,Disappointed,5,30 October 2013,"I arrived at the theater with HIGH expectations. I had boycotted the original (Kick-Ass) at the box-office, only to be blown-away when I reluctantly rented it on DVD. The theatrical trailers had billed it as a crude comedy, in the vein of Superbad & The Pineapple Express, but with a comic-book twist. I was pleasantly surprised that the movie was so much more than that. It was unexpectedly deep, almost like a ""thought-experiment."" The core concept (ordinary people as ""super"" heroes) was hardly innovative, but the style and gritty tone were fresh and exciting. It was brutally violent, and emotionally jarring. However, this was balanced with powerful universal themes and disarming humor. Watching it felt like flipping through an ""adult"" comic, not because it was loaded with nudity, profanity, etc., but because the story was not as simple as the costumed hero defeating the villain to save the day once again.Well, instead of further developing the ""magic"" of the first movie, the sequel reverts to immaturity and chases mindless laughs with over-the-top & almost ""slapstick"" antics. It feels like an unlikeable ""Family Guy"" episode where taking a joke, drawing it out, and making it more & more offensive doesn't actually make you laugh harder, or make it funnier. Instead of an intimate cast of meaningful characters, we get a massive gallery of unmemorable ones. The inspired, deep, almost philosophical tone of the original is nearly entirely absent. Even the main characters and their internal conflicts seem artificial and hollow.The movie does have it's moments, though. There are definitely several ""laugh-out-loud"" scenes. Although the vast array of characters are mostly seen vs. developed, you can appreciate how much thought went into designing the various heroes and villains. Colonel Stars & Stripes in particular was a standout that I would have loved to have seen developed more. Also Garrett M. Brown plays an essential role to convey one of the movie's key themes. Overall, it wasn't an absolute waste of time as it certainly has entertainment value. I was disappointed mostly by the waste of potential, & the decidedly different overall direction & tone of the story.",Kick-Ass 2

The film was just bad,2,26 April 2014,"This movie was so ridiculous and it was offensive.First off, I'm sick of Hollywood movies using derogatory comments against Christians. If you really listen to this script, you hear negative things against other religions which sickens me. Hollywood is the worst in hypocrisy and manipulates other religions to make money.But above the prejudice that this film has, it is just a terrible piece of work.The writer and director need review and moral judgement when they accept trash like this. To make a buck, they will show 24 yo being teenagers who use violence and ridiculous language. You call this creative? I call is selling out.",Kick-Ass 2

279,tehkao,Not a bad effort considering the source material,8,16 August 2013,"Let me preface this by saying that Kick-Ass is one of my favorite films of all time, and that Hit-Girl is probably my favorite superhero of all time. But even as a huge fan boy I have to admit the Kick-Ass 2 was not as good as the first. First of all it's much shorter (104 mins vs 117 mins), so the movie feels rushed and there's not as much character development or action scenes compared to part 1. I don't know how much of it can be blamed on the lower budget, or the fact that a lot of the original source material from the comics would be too ""hardcore"" for a movie audience. Hopefully there would be a longer, uncensored version released on Blu-Ray. The other main problem I see is that the MotherF***er wanting revenge on Kick-Ass storyline doesn't work as well as the Hit-Girl/Big Daddy vs D'Amico storyline. Also has anyone wondered why Chris had so much hatred for Kick-Ass, but not Hit-Girl? It seemed more logical that he should hate Hit-Girl even more because Kick-Ass is not a real threat. Still for fans this movie is a must-see and will be satisfying enough. I'm just sad that this might be the last we see of Hit-Girl. Maybe they can make a spin off movie for her?",Kick-Ass 2
280,steague,Perfectly fine movie.....just don't expect to be blown away (again),7,15 August 2013,"Hour and forty minutes of great entertainment. Stylish, witty and strong performances from all the leading roles (especially Chris D'Amico)So why is this 7* (good) for me against the 10* (amazing) of the original Kick Ass.Well Kick Ass had an utterly stunning musical backdrop which was a feature of the film making every major scene an 'event' In comparison the sequel is pretty feeble. (Obviously saved a few bob on the 3 musical directors they used on Kick Ass)Secondly and maybe due to the weaker soundtrack there is just so much less to remember. Kick Ass had half a dozen scenes which just blew you away. Only a couple in the sequel (and that's at a push!)That said films as amazing and unique as the original only come along every couple of years. This sequel was fun and well worth a trip to the cinema. The violence is just what you'd surely expect and only a couple of minor scenes that fall flat. NB As usual ignore paid critics reviews (Surely these guys should be put out to graze?)",Kick-Ass 2

The perfect balance of humor and violence make the first film absolutely amazing...so is the sequel amazing?As usual,the sequel is weaker than the original.Is it predictable? Yeah,but so was the first one. I still loved the hell out of it. This film is filled with thrilling action sequences,breath-taking stunts, and hilarious jokes. This is not a film where you require everyone to give an Oscar-worthy performance, so they don't, and you're fine with it. In fact, I would say the performances are just a little bit beyond what you might expect,but they're not super-serious, cause if they were, the film would fall apart along with its silly premise.Despite being really entertaining, the film is far from perfect. There are some scenes when the movie tries to go a little more serious,or even darker. I wouldn't say it fails,but it definitely doesn't feel like ""Kick-Ass"". The whole thing with Mindy trying to not to be a superhero is funny at first, less funny later,and by the end of the second act,you're screaming:""PUT THE SUIT ON ALREADY!"". However,you can have a whole lot of fun with ""Kick-Ass 2"". The movie has some strong humor, some awesome one-liners and some of the best action I've seen all year, and trust me,I gave Man Of Steel a 9.I really recommend this,you should check it out!",Kick-Ass 2

In a year full of over-hyped superhero films Kick Ass 2 came along with a low budget, no contracted actors roped in and R rating and gave me the most entertaining hour and 40 minutes I've paid for all year!Excellent acting all round especially from Jim Carrey and Chloe Moretz, this film doesn't copy and paste the first but stays close enough to it cinematically that the new director takeover isn't largely noticeable.

I think everyone's acting is superb and the characters gone through stages of development, especially Hit Girl and MotherFker carry the entire movie!! The theme of this movie is growing up and living with the consequence and the reality, and the writing portrayed it well. The movie is in a darker tone (some of the main characters being tortured, killed etc.), and may be that's why people are finding a hard time enjoying it. My only complains is Jim Carrey is under developed and such a waste of a good role. Also, some plot doesn't really make sense to me (e.g. KA father's incident in the holding cell, and the police not taking responsibility afterward), but i still enjoy it.Please watch this movie with an open mind and give it a chance.",Kick-Ass 2
284,gottennks,Everybody's a critic,10,18 August 2013,I love how rotten tomatoes always reviews movies poorly i swear it's just a bunch of hipsters over there ! Anyway onto the review This movie was great it's action is way better than the first movie i guess it's tracking so poorly because the premise is no longer new or fresh ! I think it's worth the price of admission especially if you catch a matinée . There is plenty of time for this movie to break even and turn a profit so i won't give up hop for a sequel to wrap up the trilogy > My favorite thing about this movie is it's not afraid to get brutal and dark It shows you just how impractical being a superhero in the real world really is people die and it's not pleasant . I really hope the characters continue to evolve and grow one thing i will say *Spoiler alert* Hit girl does not ride off into the sunset in the graphic novel she gets badly beaten and goes to jail and so does her guardian for protecting her secret. Also in case you didn't catch on night bitch got raped it happened off screen but it does appear to happen but in the gn it's katie who gets raped not night bitch and hit girls mother dies and the final battle takes place in times square you know what just read the graphic novels you'll be glad you did,Kick-Ass 2

I knew it wasn't going to be word for word close to the comics, neither was the first one. There is some stuff in the comics that wouldn't have worked for the film, so I understand why certain changers were made. Jim Carrey's performance as Colonel Stars and Stripes was literally spot on to his comic counterpart. Chloe Grace Moretz was great as Hit Girl, although the van chase sequence was a little cheesy. I was disappointed that Evan Peters did not return in this one. However, the action was good, the character dialogue and chemistry worked surprisingly well.

The book and the film end in very different way, similar to Watchmen, but I am glad that the film wasn't just a word for word adaptation. The film itself didn't loose its head after the success of the first, still keeping its hard hitting irony and sarcastic feel, but with even more balls out action.

A brilliant first scene pulls you in as Hit Girl demonstrates a scene from the previous movie that was between herself and Big Daddy. The result is a hilarious moment that laughs you right into the movie and you have no choice but to continue to watch.There are no boring moments during the movie and the end brings the perfect fight against good and evil.

The one thing that makes me say this is not like the first is its failure to bring anything new to the story. It's a classic story about good and evil with a twist that was created years ago by the first Kickass. The most memorable thing about this movie is the epic and hilarious fight at the end involving about a hundred superheroes and super villains. Like I said, it was great.

Kick-Ass 2 fortunately bucked the general trend and whilst not as good as the original still was pretty decent.Chloe Grace Moretz ability as an actor is growing rapidly, her performance as a torn teenager between her ordinary and superhero lives was the stand- out in my book.The only thing that I wish they had done is changed who the villain was, whilst Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Red Mist in the first movie worked I felt as though this time around they hammed up the cartoonist nature of the character and I didn't buy it.Overall I liked it, with a few small tweaks it could have been a little better.",Kick-Ass 2

It's because their stupid enough to walk into a movie named Kick Ass 2 whose predecessor cuased huge controversy and expected it to be kid friendly. Don't listen to the critics this movie is Awesome ! Kick Ass 2 is an entirely different beast than The 1st. It has a different tone and feel than the 1st. It's kinda like a different franchise just with the same characters. Surprisingly this isn't a bad thing. Sure, this movie isn't as good as the 1st but its still Awesome, in fact done of my friends thought it was better than the 1st !Major credit must go to Jeff Waldow for being able to deliver a satisfying sequel to one of my favorite movies ever ! The story follows the comics very well, but cuts out the un-needed crap from the comics (rape, decapitation of a dog, murder of little kids). I just wish that the deaths in this movie had the same impact Big Daddy's had in me in the 1st one. I feel that if they fleshed out some of the scenes (SPOILERS, Death Of Conel Stars & Stripes, Death Of Dave's Dad, The Final Battle, Hit Girl training Kick Ass. END SPOILERS) the movie could have been on par with the 1st.The Actors all do Awesome jobs in this movie. Aaron Johnson nails it once again as Kick Ass. How he can cover up his British accent is well ill never know. Chloe Mortez nails it as Hit-Girl as well. You'll love every scene she's in (yes, even the High School Drama) just because she's such an Awesome actress. Cristopher Mintz-Plasse is the most impressive though. In the movie the Mother F***er is one complex, screwed up character and Chrid is fantastic as him !

All the character were interesting and fun, ridiculous but coherent to the movie spirit. The final was amazing. Mother Russia vs Hit Girl was epic. By the way, mother Russia was some villain. Well, thats what a comic book based movie should be all about. The fun.

I picked this movie randomly because that day i just watched PLANES AND IT SUCKS, so i picked the next movie coming up. The movie is light, laugh-making, the actors are great, i love how they develop each characters & even make the villains look human(except Mother Russia, i guess)DON'T LISTEN TO THE CRITCS , THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE BEST I'VE WATCHED IN THEATRES. I'm not just a kid, i watched almost all movies in theatre and i have never been as thrilled as this. The action scenes portion compared to the story are pretty equal, although i noticed how the story focus changed from Dave to Mindy(which probably won't make u mind because Mindy is very likable), it really looks like fiction-like-fantasy-in- real-life set, and despite the awesome gore & thick rude lines (which sometimes i found really funny), the story is simple, not complicated, but deliver some silver linings. This movie kinda told about teen life that i really understand and some events really happened in my life, and i like it that way.

296,GillianKazoo,Disappointing ending????,8,25 August 2013,"Hi, so first of all I wanna say I thought the first Kick-Ass was AMAZING! But this one, wasn't as amazing as I anticipated, and I can tell you why... (WARNING: spoilers ahead)The only part that disappointed me was the ending, because when Red Mist, or now known as The M*therf*cker (also didn't really care for that name but thought it was funny) let go of Kick-Ass's hand and fell into the shark tank, we all knew it was going to happen. And that's fine, but he died... And a lot of people would be like yeah so what? But I was expecting Mindy/Hit Girl to swoop him out from there, or someone, anyone, and then he would thank Kick-Ass for trying to save his life and realized all that has happened and realized his uncle was really the bad guy, and returned as Red Mist along side Kick-Ass and Hit Girl and Justice Forever, to see how they get along and what kind of relationships they have going to school together and trying to fit in, I wasn't expecting Dave's dad to die either, which was sad also. I also thought that Hit Girl was also another possible death, but I'm glad she didn't kick the bucket. Sorry to say but I just don't think it would be a sequel without Red Mist/Chris Demeko/The M*therf*cker... I don't really see how it would be as effective.And the whole fighting scene, it was nice and all, but the first one I liked better because they sent Mindy/Hit Girl in as a lost young little girl, but she had to fight her way to the top level aka the boss level and they had to duck and make their way through the hotel in enemy territory. And the slaughters and jokes, I didn't really expect much jokes for its mostly an action movie but I didn't really notice a whole lot, and the part where The M*therf*cker and his evil army went to Night Bitch's house and said ""get ready to see how evil dick feels"" or whatever, I thought it would've been funnier if his zipper got stuck. Initially that's what I thought happened, until he said ""I'm not in the mood."" On the bright side, the scene where Dave's in the van and Mindy has to save him was awesome! And the lawnmower death was pretty cool with the blood and all that. So I guess my expectations were a little high, and it was a good movie, but not quite as fur filling and satisfying as I wished and hoped for Thanks for reading.",Kick-Ass 2

Instead they show Kick-Ass joining some sort of Justice League for losers, while Hit Girl learning how to be popular in high school!!!And one of the things that bothers me the most is that how the relationship between Dave and Katie works out in the movie.Oh, did i mention that the villain is annoying as hell..and most of the jokes falls flat..

300,albfilms,Fun to watch with great moral to the story and characters.,9,25 August 2013,"My take on this sequel is AWESOME!!! Cloe was great at giving emotion during scenes that really made you feel for her character behind the mask. The promises to her father and caretaker really stand out for me. People who really stick by their word was a huge moral of the story. I also liked the idea of ""It's your life"". You make your own rules and morals and stick to them. Also, to be a superhero you must act like one. Much like Superman, and Batman who do not kill their enemies. That's where this film fails to meet it's own moral of not hurting the bad guys... ""Not hurting"" I guess means not using guns. They only used their marshal arts skills and other weapons of choice such as nun-chucks, sticks, sick taser. Other than that, Jim Carry has no reason to gripe about the violence. Anyone who sees this movie must have a heart because each character (besides the bad guys) who died you feel sad and bad. The movie shows what killing does to the the victims loved ones.Very fun movie, and still has the heart of the first one. A must see.",Kick-Ass 2

303,theawesomespamsponge,Real life heroes require the greatest suspension of disbelief,4,24 April 2014,"There's something entirely off about the Kick-Ass universe. It certainly seems promising. The prevailing message is interesting enough: that ordinary people can be heroic without super powers. All they need is sufficient dedication and enthusiasm. Also interesting is the consequences for this, in the real world, where things don't always go neatly, not everything turns out for the best, and the hero doesn't always prevail in the end. There's definitely plenty of meat for a decent story here.However, it's understandably difficult to pull off in the context a of Hollywood movie. A truly realistic superhero story probably ends with a guy getting stabbed, and either dying or giving up the game for good. There would be nothing for the audience to enjoy or appreciate, other than the cold and depressing light of reality shone upon the escapist fantasy of super heroism. Any story exploring these themes have to walk a careful line. They must have enough realism to explore the themes, but also enough escapism so that the fans of the superhero genre are entertained. And, although the movie had many flaws, the original Kick-Ass movie managed to do this with some degree of competence.I wish I could say the same about Kick-Ass 2. Instead of walking this line, Kick-Ass 2 blunders across it, staggering from one side to the other, but heavily favours the escapist side. Still present is the graphic and stylised violence committed by minors and the highly flawed super heroes. Now, there's a self-styled villain (who doubles as comic relief). Yes, there's a ""real life"" person who figures that his purpose in life is to be a villain, like in comic books. This is a person who wants to make trouble for the citizens of the city, because this is what villains do. Not out of greed, not out of vengeance (for the most part), but adherence to the villain archetype. And what's more, he found plenty of equally villainous sidekicks.It's not just the ludicrous plot, but the interactions between characters often seem ridiculous. One of the themes the movie deals with is Hit Girl's newly found high school drama, which gives rise to one of the movies most laughably incongruous sequences. Hit Girl is invited to a sleepover with the popular clique, and for some reason, the dialogue is comprised entirely from subtext that usually is not spelled out. I say 'for some reason', but it's clear it's supposed to be funny and a little confronting. The net effect was that my suspension of disbelief was completely shattered, I no longer cared about these caricatures, and I found myself wondering why I was still watching.If you can indeed suspend your belief, overcome the hackneyed writing, and endure the sickly sweet stench of omnipresent fan service, then there are still some things to like in Kick-Ass 2. Jim Carrey is unrecognisable and believable as the ex-mafia enforcer Col. Stars and Stripes, and Christopher Minz-Plasse does hit some effective notes in his reprise of his role as Chris D'Amico. Plus the movie is sumptuously shot, and the audio was well done (especially in a particular scene involving one woman and some police cars). However, these features are just icing on a somewhat fishy-smelling cake. If you're a fan of the comics, then I'm sure you'll enjoy yourself, but if you aren't, then there are better things to do with your time.",Kick-Ass 2
304,nrs05,Not watered down at all...,9,20 August 2013,"* Mild Spoilers * I was skeptical of a Kick-Ass sequel, but I thought Kick-Ass 2 was an amazingly fun and well-written movie, that stands independently as a fully worthy follow-up to its predecessor. Kick-Ass 2 is surprising in a lot of ways, and can be enjoyed from different perspectives.It works well as an action film - a few of the sequences were brilliantly choreographed (particularly the scene with Hit Girl on the van), the pacing is good, and the character development is mature; but it also works on several other levels. It is at times shockingly violent, and also at times shockingly smart (addressing complex themes of youth exposure to sex and violence, and getting pretty ""meta"" about it). And it works perfectly well as a comedy, with good delivery of the lines by all the actors, good timing, and enough jokes to keep you laughing without compromising some pretty serious moments.Overall, I was really impressed, and most importantly I had a lot of fun watching this movie. this movie pulls no punches at all (which is rare for a big-budget Hollywood film these days - and which gets deep respect from me), and is refreshingly action-packed but simultaneously well paced. this movie entertains throughout, but not at the expense of the characters or the quality of the dialogue.",Kick-Ass 2

However Christopher Mintz reinvents himself as the Motherf***er and starts building an evil army to get revenge over Kick-Ass. Tensions rise and the consequences are bigger. A lot more characters is introduced in this installment and it helps flesh out the world a lot more. Most of them are even memorable. Writer and Director Jeff Wadlow has done a fine job here and I hope this movie eventually will get the praise it deserves! See it! 10/10",Kick-Ass 2
306,blade399,Kick-Ass... But not so hard this time,6,14 August 2013,"There's not much to say really, it just wasn't as good as the first.(Spoilers will be marked)The story felt disjointed and lacked that sense of being grounded within it's a world. The opening scenes were done well (spoiler) with Kick-Ass being trained by Hit-Girl. In particular the first fight scene of the movie, where Kick-Ass is acting as bait, had that bit of an edge which the first film carried throughout (spoiler end)However, the bits that come in between and the high school ""chick-flic"" story that followed were good for the character but detrimental to the flow of the film. Wadlow seems to have a hard time grasping drama within this very eventful film and although the core sequences are done well (spoiler) Stars and Stripes being brutally murdered (spoiler end) there are many moments that just felt empty, such as (spoiler) Mr. Lizewski's death (spoiler end)I'm not hating on Wadlow because he preformed strokes of genius in every scene that featured Chris D'Amico and can craft very good action sequences. But there was no edge. Everything felt like it ended too quickly which ultimately left me feeling like there was an hour or so missing from the film. (SPOILERS)Kick-Ass breaking up with Katie was a 5 second scene. There was literally nothing but a small comedic exchange. These moments of drama were weak. It felt like it was going on scene-to- scene with the dialogue being exactly the same.""I don't wanna be Kick-Ass/Hit-Girl"" ""But Kick-Ass/Hit-Girl is who you really are!""Bland.The climax was the ultimate downer. Gone was the long build up from burning warehouse, to Red-Mist shooting Hit-Girl, to the torture scene, to the apartment shoot-out. GONE! Instead are a nice build up of evil events from ""The Toxic Mega C***"" that leads to a shallow stand off between the Heroes and Villains.I know there's not much detail, but this review is ironically reminiscent of the film I watched 30 minutes ago. It feels like there's a lot missing and more to be explained.From someone who hails the first film as my personal favourite, this was a let down and I wish Matthew were back to direct such brilliant actors (Hats off to Jim Carrey and Christopher MP on their outstanding performances)7/10, thank you",Kick-Ass 2
307,kruegerfan97,A perfect sequel to a perfect movie,8,17 August 2013,"""Kick-Ass"" (the first film) is one of my all-time favourite films. Everything about it is perfect. The characters, the story, the performances, the cinematography, the humor, the drama etc. So I had VERY high expectations for ""KA2"" and I wasn't disappointed. When I walked out of the cinema last night, I had the same feeling of adrenaline I had after seeing ""Kick-Ass"" for the first time. The story and drama is more darker while the humor of the first film is left intact and they both balance well. The new characters are a ton of fun to watch while the original recurring characters are more developed and everyone of them have something refreshing to put into this film. And the rest of the film actually expands what I loved about the first film. The violence/gore is freaking tremendous compared to the first film, the story has much more to deal with and delivers a smooth and highly satisfying one with extremely unexpected twists as well as equally entertaining subplots, the cinematography still keeps the gorgeous, comic-book-esque style which makes the colours literally pop out of the screen, the score is, yet again, magnificent and fits perfectly with the tone of the film while still linking to the fanfares of the first film (e.g. Danny Elfman's score to ""Batman Returns""). Linking to both the story and the characters, both the drama and the humor balance perfectly, just like the first film with the humor blending well to the comic book-like world the two films are set in and the drama inflicted on the characters really does give the film a slightly more serious theme than the first film, which a sequel should do instead of repeating what happened before. If I would nit-pick over something, I would say some of the newer characters could have had some more development (especially some of the villains), but that's just a very mild complaint. Overall, with Matthew Vaughn leaving the director's chair as a producer and a big Hollywood company like Universal involved, this would've been an insult to the original. But it was, in fact, the exact opposite. Don't listen to the abysmal 20-something% rating on RT. In my opinion, I would call it a perfect sequel to a perfect movie. 'Nuff said.",Kick-Ass 2

First of all it really too exaggerated a looot of violence ( really too much more than the first movie) and there are really a Lot of scenes during which you are just thinking :"" okay. He/she should be dead"" That always exasperates me when movies make you believe you are invicible... Second of all I didn't find kick-ass'sweet side of the weak who tries and fail he is more bad-ass and it's a bit of a shame. Finally the scenario ends up a bit weak with unnecessary scenes about high school and teenagers, no real plot and a lot of fights. I would give a 6 out of 10 I give a 7 because of the very good cliffhanger at the end I hope that kick-ass 3 will be better;)",Kick-Ass 2
309,surlaroute,"It's not offensive, it's just embarrassing",3,15 August 2013,"There's a scene in Kick-Ass 2 where one of Dave's only friends who hasn't quite got into the whole ""real life superheroes"" act yet finally joins them in an outfit that is basically an inversion of Dave's yellow-and-green jumpsuit and tries to choose his name. All he can come up with is variations like ""Ass Kick!"" and ""The Asskicker"" to which Dave and his other friend understandably roll their eyes. He later changes sides completely.Remember that awful movie that the Daily Mail reviewed and accidentally called Kick-Ass? That's what Kick-Ass 2 is really a sequel to. It's so much a pale interpretation of what some terrible people thought the first movie was (and I'm afraid one of those people may be the series' creator, Mark Millar, who quite famously reads the Daily Mail) that it may as well be titled one of those awful unimaginative names Dave's friends comes up with.I was actually fine with the awful clangers early on in this movie the Austin Powers-esque, ""she sure had some big guns"" followed by a shot of someone carrying some actual big guns towards the camera, the blatant descriptive gags like ""his baton is so much bigger than Kick-Ass's baton means cock, by the way"" the desperate attempts to be current with Mother F**ker spouting his plans to basically tear the world down and then saying, ""I gotta tweet about this!""I could deal with all this because I didn't expect much from this movie except for Hit Girl to be awesome. I really thought they couldn't mess that up because she's such an indestructible character. There's an early line where she tells her foster father, ""I've done more in 15 years of my life than most adults have done in all of theirs,"" and it should ring hard for anyone over 30. Even part of the sequence I'm about to talk about gives a fine glimpse of what Chloe Moretz's Carrie might be like – in short, it might work, she shows the kind of vulnerability I didn't ever expect to see in such a face – a face that, if I described honestly, I'd probably be taken in by YewtreeBut it's in that middle sequence, the bulk of Moretz's strangely short screen time (she was the highlight of the first movie and even the negative reviews of this one single her out – I'm afraid I can't even be that generous), where this movie really lost me entirely. It begins as a strange Mean Girls knock-off with Mindy (Hit Girl) quite inexplicably going along with a plan to make her ""like other girls"", passing through a strange slumber party scene where she basically gets horny for the first time watching a ""Union J"" video (I was surprised to find this cheesy looking band, looking as fake as everything else in this movie, is actually real – and Chloe Moretz is a fan, forcing me to assume it's her doing), and proceeding to a clichéd looking jock taking her on her first date (her foster father, so protective, seems to be fine with this) that for a horrible second I thought was going to lead into some kind of rape (I forget if the other ""rape"" scene happens before or after this – I'm not even gonna talk about that 'cos it's been mentioned plenty elsewhere). Instead she is met by her fellow school pals and then deserted. HURTFUL! This whole middle act story ends with Mindy strolling into school dressed like all the other shallow girls and prodding them with an invention of Big Daddy from the first movie – a stick that makes them throw up and diarrhoea at the same time, which looks more like vanilla and chocolate pudding coming out of both ends. It was at this point that if you'd photographed me you'd have seen a face that looked a little like when Eric Cartman's funny bone broke in ""South Park"".It's not that I'm offended by this stuff. If you know me, you know this. And I knew that under any other circumstance I would've found it tear-inducingly funny. There was just something about the way it was done, and the context, that kind of paralysed me. It was just so  pointless.Jim Carrey disowned this movie because of the violence after Sandy Hook etc. He'd've done better just saying he was embarrassed at how it turned out. I heard there was a post-credits scene at the end of Kick-Ass 2, but I left as soon as the screen went black and I wished for once I was the kind of person who leaves earlier sometimes. Frankly unless that post-credits scene was Ashton Kutcher saying ""you've been punk'd!"", I think at least I saved some of my time the day I saw this. It's not offensive, it's just embarrassing. The only good thing is that it'll make you realise just how classy the first movie was. Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn, you are sorely missed",Kick-Ass 2

(She's so cute!) I just wished the love interest with hit girl and kick-ass would have gone more( just hoping) but aside from that even there were so many characters in the movie they've been great, from small roles to big roles. Has a great plot and story line. It seems the movie was well executed. I also love the fighting scenes especially when hit girl saves kick-ass from the bad guys. It also has a soft side where in kick-ass got mad to his pops and when he was going to be arrested his dad took his place. I hope there's a kick-ass 3! please!!!",Kick-Ass 2
311,tabathazee,Surprisingly Disappointing,4,17 August 2013,"As a huge fan of the comics and first film, I was completely surprised by how much I disliked this sequel. Both films are incredibly lighthearted when compared to the comics, but ""Kick-Ass 2"" lacks the charm that the first captured, regardless of violent nature. I'm a big fan of action movies and have no problem with violence or profanity in films, but the over-use of unnecessary gross-out gags felt out of place and ruined this sequel for me. I was already turned off by the unnecessary changes made to the storyline (when compared to the comics) but the countless projectile vomit/feces shots completely ruined the entire experience for me. For any fans of the comics, note that changes to the story HAD to be made to compensate for Hit-Girl's age (who appears to be 16 in the film). Many other new details were added to the story, but many elements were changed, for the worst in most cases.",Kick-Ass 2
312,jamesmccloskey98,Fantastic!,10,18 August 2013,"This film is fantastic. The acting is all good. It's both funny and action-packed. I don't see how the film could have been any better. It's the best superhero film of the year so far, despite its lower budget. The first one was a tough act to follow and despite my worries that this film would be a let-down (due to the change of director), it was even better. I highly recommend this film to people who enjoy superhero films. It was simply (for me), the perfect superhero film. The Hit-Girl storyline showed a more vulnerable Hit-Girl than the first and the Kick-Ass storyline was more dramatic than before. It's a fantastic sequel and I loved it.",Kick-Ass 2
313,ste-gormo,"Very entertaining and fun, just not as good as the first instalment",8,17 August 2013,"Kick Ass was one of the finest, funniest and most exhilarating movies of 2010 and with the eponymous hero wiping out mobsters, along with Chloe- Grace-Moretz' hysterically brilliant Hit-Girl, with brilliantly stylised violence, the second instalment doesn't disappoint. Any fan of the original should well give the second a watch, Chloe Grace-Moretz is the star of the whole film though and her Hit-Girl remains one of the funniest characters to watch at the cinema, especially when she's being the foul-mouthed, ultra-skilled and violent little girl every fan will love. The story is entertaining and the action is never dull, some of the new villain's and heroes are unique compared to the real world mobsters of the first part, but whether that proves a good thing is debatable. The action scenes are wholly entertaining, whether Mother Russia is wiping out police-men with her own brand of evil or Chris D'Amico and Kick-Ass are beating each other on a rooftop. In fact, my only complaint with this movie is that it falls short of the original in many respects- the action, humour and violence is not quite as enthralling as it was. Any fan should see this, and newcomers should also come for the entrainment value amongst other things, and it's nicely set up for a third instalment too, which is one of the many positives to draw from this sequel, which is in no way deserving of the poor reviews it is getting on other sites. Go and watch it, but don't be too surprised if it doesn't meet the excellence of its predecessor.",Kick-Ass 2
314,onionsoup321,"Missed the Mark, Huge let down.",5,17 August 2013,I was so excited when I heard that they were making a Kickass 2 movie because I really enjoyed the first movie and the comic series. I even went to the premiere showing. I feel like it was a joke they literally took out just about everything I loved from the comic. The one redeeming factor was Cornell Stars and Strips (Jim Carry). His part was actually really good but he was only in it for like 5-10 minutes. It seemed like a movie for kids and the messed up part they took out some of the more violent scenes and instead did raunchy jokes about 15 year old girls. For example a boy band plays and one of the girls mentions how shes soaked. It really seemed so anticlimactic and the way it ends means that the 3rd Kickass is going to be nothing like the comic. Hitgirl doesn't even get arrested at the end and The Motherf!@#$r actually dies instead of getting crippled. There was no intense scene at the end in Times Square with the cops attacking the villains and heroes indiscriminately . All in all the movie missed the mark in so many ways and I pray to god that they don't make a 3rd movie. I read the first issue of Kickass 3 and the way the movie ended means that the 3rd will be even less like that comic. I understand the director can take some creative liberties but he literally took away just about everything that made the first movie and comics so awesome. I was looking forward to this movie for months and kept talking it up to all my friends and now just feel like it was a waste of 103 minutes of my life. Maybe If you go to the movie with no expectations and haven't read the comic series then you might enjoy it a little.,Kick-Ass 2
315,ragmon88,"5 if you read the comic, 7 if not.",5,2 September 2013,"So I am one of those people who read the comic book before watching the Kick-Ass 2, and boy was it a mistake.Major Issues with the Movie (If you read the comic): The major issue I have with the movie is that it differs too much from the original comic. Yes I am aware they cant show the level of brutality on the big screen BUT...Like in the first movie I do not agree with Mindy's dad's story cause the whole Mindy story in the comics is about her and her mother and the step-dad Marcus (who is a cop, they got that right).And The Mother F***-er slaughtering innocent civilians without hesitation. This is the point of no return for him as a villain and a huge miss in the screen writers part.The end fight, was the whole point in the comic where the villains go rampage the town, setting buildings on fire and even explaining why the police are elsewhere, not getting involved immediately (they set of bombs around the city). And in the comic its not the shark that mangles The Mother F***-er (as they mentioned in the movie they placed the shark in the incorrect environment), but the break the glass and there is a final confrontation on the roof. Thus The MF doesn't lose his legs, which I think if they want to go on to Kick-Ass 3 will be a bit of an issue.I don't mind the movie not showing stuff like:The Mother F***-er's gang raping Kick-Ass's Ex-girlfriend. Jim Carry's character being beheaded and the dogs head being placed on his head (yea yea Game of Thrones).If you did not read the comics: The movie unnecessarily goes into the school scenes instead of focusing the The MF's development. The jokes could have been a bit more well written. I would have liked Jim Carry's character to be a bit more serous so we could feel his conviction as a hero. The Night B**** character was unnecessary involved in Kick-Ass's life. The MF was no evil enough, the villain didn't feel really threatening.Bonus: The ""puke taser"" was extremely out of place and just the lowest point of the movie, would have been better if they just used the original scene from the comic. Where Mindy pushes the ""mean girl"" of the roof only to catch her by the foot (with rope tied t something) and says something like ""So we are friends from now on right?"" girl answers ""yes"", Mindy drops her only for the girl to drop into garbage truck, with the ending line ""the truck might be late a minute next time"". Much better then ""zap-and-puke"".In conclusionNot a bad movie if the haven't read the comic, but I have and the movie was a major letdown. The threat of the bad guys did not come trough for me. The consequences of the actions of the heroes and the villains weren't outlined as much as it should have been. Wait for a movie discount and then watch it, trust me your not missing anything ground breaking.",Kick-Ass 2

The story really touched my heart because of the emotions that were add in the film was brilliant. Surprisingly emotional! There are a few scenes here and there that might just pull a heart string they don't feel overly cheezy, and fit right in with the story and my tears were dropping went they killed Kick-Ass's father was terrible and really the saddest part of the entire film.Loved Jim Carrey's role in the film perfectly done and Hit Girl OMG soo beautiful and really got older kinda surprising,Kick- Ass always the best and The Motherfcuker A.K.A Red Mist or Chris D Amico was the best loved his act and would give him a two Thumps up for making my day.

Okay, kids would not be able to take kicks and punches like that, but aside from that, it's pretty realistic, or at least realistic enough for me to suspend disbelief long enough to enjoy the movie. I love the crass humor and vulgar language. Come on! Don't be a prude! This is how these characters would talk! Like Kick-Ass, Kick-Ass 2 is a great story. Then, on top of the great story, there is great action, decent acting, lots of funny lines, and even a little bit of drama. I hope they do a Kick-Ass 3! That said, this movie is not for kids.

I really liked that fact all the heroes were'not indestructible like superman or didn't have the money to but gadgets like batman; some would have to have days off just because of normal colds. most of them had meanings for what they are doing, so just because of this it makes the film seem more relate-able because of these problems ordinary families have to face.

320,delsworld86,"Not So Much Kick-Ass, As The Amazing Garfieldman",5,7 December 2013,"With all the bland CGI superhero movies currently plaguing the big screen, I've always found Kick Ass to be a breath of fresh air, down to earth and far more realistic than the green screen triumphs that barely ring true to the eyes of the more demanding of cinema goers. Like me.Kick Ass 2 has all the themes that were present in the original: violence, irony and humour but it's bugged by a heavy Amazing Garfieldman-ish ""with great power, comes great responsibility"" bla bla bla style script. Strangely, the movie sways more towards the coming of age drama, rather than the light-hearted comic book parody that made the first movie a fan favourite. It's just not as fun. Kick Ass himself is almost sidetracked in favour of a new league of superheroes led by everyone's favourite rubber faced man - Lloyd Christmas. There's a great cast and it's well acted but it's all a bit flat, with none of the new characters having any real back story.Christopher Mintz-Plasse is fantastic as the camp, psychopathic nemesis of Kick-Ass, who takes on an all new costume for this outing. He has the best lines and appears to have had a ball making the movie.If there is one consistently appealing feature, for me, it's the limited use of CGI in favour of impressive stunts. Sure there's not as much requirement for it; Kick-Ass doesn't need to time travel or fly, or a CGI cape and doesn't need graphics to reduce the size of his forehead like Tom Hiddleston. When the third instalment is decided upon, which I'm certain it will be, I believe this movie will prove to be the bridge between two far superior films. And hopefully the producers manage to get Nicholas Cage's moustache back for a cameo.",Kick-Ass 2

There's no way I couldn't NOT watch it, though, so I did. And it was awesome. It wasn't nearly as amazing as the first Kick Ass, because that would be impossible, but it was still amazing from beginning to finish. Just like the first one, Hit Girl carried the entire movie. I'm only writing this because of all the bad reviews I'm seeing for it. If you liked the first Kick Ass movie, then GO SEE THIS.Ugh, IMDb is telling me the review is too short. FINE. Just like in the first Kick Ass movie, the theater was nearly empty. And just like in the first one, there was lots of blood and gross stuff and Hit Girl beating the crap out of adults. I was really worried about the movie having Jim Carrey in it - I'm a fan of Carrey, but I didn't want him to take over the movie. No problem with that, though, because he was awesome without being over the top and he had minimal screen time. The trailer made it seem like it was the new Jim Carrey movie. There was about 15 minutes in the middle of the movie where the movie turned into Mean Girls and they won over Hit Girl by showing her a boy band video. Nope, not kidding about that. It was all pretty funny stuff, but seemed a little out of place. Now IMDb has me complaining about things. Thanks a lot, IMDb. Don't listen to me. Just go see Kick Ass as soon as possible! And see it in the theater. And bring lots of friends, because I have a feeling this movie is bombing, judging from 10 other customers that were in the theater tonight. Now I'm depressed.

322,JazzyGB1,"A decent sequel, without the 'magic' of the first film",7,14 August 2013,"It's a bit unfair to give this film a bad review, as it's a very enjoyable movie - it's just not in the same league as its predecessor. The thing that was most lacking in this was the menace. In the original Kick Ass, (SPOLIER) the scene where Big Daddy is kidnapped and tortured is gruesome and genuinely disturbing, his subsequent rescue scene was absolutely brilliant...full of tension and his death is very moving and emotive too. The follow up scene at the hotel was fantastic (SPOILER END). It also had scenes that made you cheer and laugh at loud, so the first film really had everything, which is why it was such a bloody brilliant film! :) This one was too...well...safe. It just didn't have that tension and so things that happened to certain characters in the film were not nearly as engaging. There was lots of edited out violence, which again stopped you feeling really exposed or scared as you did in the first film. The CGI was too obvious in the Van sequence which made that scene a bit lacklustre too. And the musical soundtrack of the first Kick Ass was inspired. The soundtrack this time is...alright...but again, it's not great as it was in the original. This is sort of the pattern for most elements in this film. Not bad, but not nearly as good as what came before. On the plus side, the humour was still there, Jim Carey was absolutely brilliant, I liked the continuation of the characters (particularly Hit girl & Kick Ass), which did a good job of keeping the consistency from the first film and there's a couple of good action scenes in it too. :) So it's not a bad film, it really In't...it's just not great like the first one. I always thought Kick Ass as a film should have remained alone - a one off. This movie really confirms that theory. It's enjoyable, with good humour, good action and some good performances too (Jim Carey), but it's not the brilliant, total shock to the system the first Kick Ass was, so if you're expecting a film of that calibre you'll be disappointed. So it's not bad, it's just not great and doesn't have the magic of the first. There's no truly memorable scenes in it, unlike the original which is defined by them. If you fancy some good action and a bit of a chuckle, Kick Ass 2 wont disappoint. I'd give it 7/10, the original would be 9, maybe even 9.5 and remains the 'Big daddy'! :)",Kick-Ass 2

There were only 12 other people on opening night in this theater. But that's the way I like it, so I can enjoy this movie to the fullest. My sleep schedule is a bit messed up so I can get a bit comfy during a movie and somewhat doze off (recently Elysium, and others I can't remember.) Didn't matter how tired I was, I knew I would not miss a beep this time around. Maybe just because I'm a Kick-Ass fan and I have been waiting on this movie ever since Red Mist said ""Wait till they get a load of me."" Well, he did just that. He brought the mother load. Any questions about the first movie are tied up nicely. The movie was slightly more darker and serious, although hilarious at points, compared to the first one. When a movie has more characters, it seems like a mess and can be hard to concentrate on everything at once. But Kick Ass 2 doesn't let that get out of hand too much and introduces the main extras nicely. Even though it feels a bit messy and the lines are not always top notch, it does a great job at staying true to what makes Kick Ass so special. The realness, the feelings, the laughs, the violence and the emotion. I admit I shed a tear or two.Just when you may think the movie is slipping in the wrong direction, something real or intense happens and throws you back in. Even though it's hard to get a lot of screen time in this fun hour and forty-three minutes, I found Dr. Gravity to be a trip and a delight addition to the Kick Ass franchise. I would like to see more from him if they were to make a Kick Ass 3 (please, please, please.) Mother Russia, enough said. What a final match up.

325,Chris_MacGuffin,Abhorrent Follow-Up,1,7 July 2014,"Jeff Wadlow's vile follow-up to Matthew Vaugn's enjoyable but ultimately escapist comedy Kick-Ass is every failure that Vaughn managed to avoid. While one could accuse Vaughn of sensationalizing violence and ultimately abandoning his own satiric point, at least Kick-Ass was anchored by strong performances, including a fantastic turn by Nicolas Cage. No such luck here. Moretz is a capable actor but she's given little to do. Her entrance into womanhood is presented with the tact of a bad teen soap and her ultimate conquest over her bullies is both tame and disgustingly underwhelming at the same time. Wadlow's ear is deaf and his tone loud like that of a child banging a drum. It's a retread that systematically destroys everything the original film had going for it. From it's characters, to it's performances, to ultimately the world itself. I don't know what the point of it all is. Poorly conceived ""superheroes"" brutally beating people to bloody pulps is funny? If we're going to have an empty film, could we at least have it well made? Or are we just along for a cheap, amoral ride?",Kick-Ass 2
326,aoifeoleary91,A good enough sequel to a great film.,8,14 August 2013,"Kick-Ass 2 is considerably darker than the original, yet it still retains its humour. A solid cast is let down by some superhero tropes and the absence of Nic Cage is really felt. Some of the plot has really been done to death by other superhero films, it's no longer shocking when a loved hero hangs up their cape and retires, nor is it much surprise when a previously good hero turns to the dark side, seeking revenge. There is a lot of violence and absurdity in equal measure. My biggest complaint is that Jim Carrey should have had more screen time. Fans of the comic will be a bit puzzled at some of the choices made in the script, but not a bad adaptation. Enjoyable, but won't win Oscars. 8/10.",Kick-Ass 2
327,faceyourfear2011,Perfect sequel! Well done Jeff Wadlow!,8,26 August 2013,"Kick-Ass 2 is an action comedy film directed by Jeff Wadlow. Following from the first movie Kick-Ass this movie is about Kick-Ass facing more challenges and Mindy trying to live a normal life from being Hit-Girl.Starting from the beginning the movie continuously keeps us entertained with action, a bit of comedy. The director exactly knows to keep the viewer interested other than making the viewer bored. However, the movie lost some stuff from the original movie were somewhat less such as the ironic comedy.Still I'd recommend it to any one who watched the original to watch this movie.Thank You",Kick-Ass 2
328,hello-284-643424,Absolutely brilliant,9,14 August 2013,"When I saw this film was coming out, I could not contain my excitement. I enjoyed the first one immensely and was happy to see they were doing a sequel. Admitially I was a bit skeptic about the 2nd one, as most other films which I have seen that have been sequels, the 1st is usually always 10x better than the first one.I personally think this film is much more exciting and has better scenes of violence. I have read other reviews on this movie slating this film as an 'enjoyable time waster' I would have to 1000% disagree with this and I would probably say that out of all the movies I have seen this year, this one by far tops it.I think the acting in this and the people they got to play the other super-heroes was just perfect, every new super hero made me laugh and again they were also involved in some epic fight scenes.So to anyone who is a bit skeptic (as I was) about seeing this movie.. Don't! It's 'Kick-Ass' awesome.",Kick-Ass 2
329,Giacomo_Sighele,very good movie,9,22 July 2014,"in my opinion this film is even better than the first one! it is very well written, with smart dialogues, clever humor and very cool choreography of the fights. the actors are great, in particular chloë grace moretz, she's really a talented actress and she did an amazing job. i really enjoyed watching it, i was gonna vote 10 out of 10 but... like in the first one, they have to shoot a bad final. i'm gonna spoil the comics too. in the first one dave hook up with lyndsy fonseca while in the comics she humiliates him and has her friends beat him up. now this cliché final with a kiss and a character that just have to leave... face palm, instead of the police that arrests everyone. by the way, the flirt between hit girl and kickass it is just...wrong! he doesn't even try to stop the kiss! my sad opinion is that the production and distribution companies have forced the 2 finals, because even if is not perfectly accurate to the comics, as i said, the movies are great in everything beside the finals, that seems written by someone else.",Kick-Ass 2
330,alfanoandaru,The sequel that I wanted,8,31 October 2013,"Kick ass 2 is offering a much better story, a much better kick-ass action, a much better comedy, i could said this is the perfect sequel for kick ass.I've been closely watched this anticipating movie. Not only i could see Chloe grace Moretz as a teenager which is one of the main reason i watch this movie. But also the appearance of Jim Carrey that we already know as one of the greatest comedian of all time.I really enjoy this movie. How the story was perfectly put. This movie can bring you in an intense feeling after a great laugh of comedy. And also a bigger scale of reality-superhero fighting. The name of the character, the costume, it was way beyond than the first movie. A perfect sequel.",Kick-Ass 2
331,arhodes-658-591615,Great in its own way.,7,16 August 2013,"I have to be honest and say that I loved the first Kick-A## for its bold look into the reality of superhero life without super powers. In the same way, Kick-A## 2 takes steps into uncharted comfort zones and entertains while at the same time challenging your comfort and expectations.This is not a movie for all, but for those who are not looking for the ""kid like"" blockbuster film and more of a true grit style; this is for you. The only flaw that I can give is echoed by those at spill.com; this movie does not allow the characters of interest enough time to develop. With all of the movie choices out today I would say that this was a solid pick to put into your lineup. To give you a little insight into what I like(for taste reference), here is a list of films I chose to see this summer. 1.The Wizard Of Oz 7 / 10 2.Iron Man 3 8 / 10 3.This Is The End 8 / 10 4.World War Z 8 / 10 5.White House Down 7 / 10 6.Pacific Rim 9 / 10 7.Despicable Me 2 8 / 10 8.Red 2 7 / 10 9.Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters 7 / 10 10.Kick-A## 2 8 / 10Not That I did not see others but this was the core of movies I felt were memorable.",Kick-Ass 2
332,mukade17,Indeed it kicked ass... But it could have kicked more,8,18 August 2013,"As most of you know, the first one was fantastic. This sequel went a little in another direction. Not to say that this is a bad thing. I say this because after the first half hour of the movie, practically all comedy is gone and it becomes a pretty serious and violent film.This may be a downside to some people, and others would see it as a big improvement. In a sense, it kind of was for me. I was expecting to see a movie that was consistently funny throughout the whole movie (like the first one).The only real downside to this movie is that the new characters didn't have a lot of screen time. Jim Carrey's character was pretty bad ass and had tons of potential. It's disappointing that he was advertised as one of the main characters and then he's killed off less than half way through the movie.To sum it up, it's definitely worth watching, but don't expect to get the same laughs out of this one like you did in the first one.",Kick-Ass 2
333,jmacsporran,"Different from the comic, but that's not a bad thing",7,15 August 2013,"For those who have read the comic book series, you will have some expectations about this film. But for those who have seen Kick Ass, and read the comic it is based on you know that the film takes liberties and makes changes which are suitable for this media. Kick Ass 2 is not an exception. This is not a page for page, and panel for panel uplift from the comic, but rather a an adaptation which has taken the core elements and adapted it for the audience.For those who know of the more gruesome elements of the comic, which shocked many in the comic book community, if you do not want them, hoorah, they have been adapted. Being more emotional, and even more humorous. With the scene involving Night Bitch and the Mother f***er being one of the best adaptations.So what can I say about the film? Having been in the very first showing of this film in my local area on the opening day, I have been looking forward to this for a significant period of time since I heard it was to come, and saw the trailers. My girlfriend was per obligation brought along, and she is not the usual fan of comic book based films (though I am winning her round). The film has a brief, literally very brief outline of the first film, so it is almost essential to have seen the first film to understand how everything is connected. Character development has been progressed, especially with Mindy/Hit Girl storyline, and Dave/Kick Ass.Yes there is moments where the pace slows, and yes there is now the infamous Union J scene, but it detracts little from the film, but has an almost natural course in showing Mindy's development. She has to choose between her legacy left from her father, and her new adopted father trying to give her a ""normal"" life, but what is normal. That is the main question asked in this film.Jim Carrey, brings a heavy hitter to the film, just as Nicholas Cage did with the first. But the main stars of the show remains Aaron and Chloe. Both have developed, and both have a future in the film industry, though Chloe is definitely the rising star.It has an almost rushed pace to the film, with some scenes in the trailer not appearing either at all or fully, so expect these to appear in the |R-rated uncut version of the DVD. The film, like the first leaves the ending open, just in case there is no Kick Ass 3. But I hope there is, the trilogy must be finished, and I would love to see how the potential romantic relationship between Mindy and Dave develops, especially as it likely that Kick Ass 3 will be filmed when Chloe Moretz is 18.How would I rate this. Definitely a 9/10, not as good as the first. But not the worst sequel. What let it down? Definitely a rushed pace which suggests backroom cutting of scenes. But definitely well worth seeing, ignore the critics. Give it a try, you will not regret it.",Kick-Ass 2
334,dwvaughn11,Will Satisfy In a Different Spot Than The First.,6,21 June 2014,"What had made Kick-Ass so special was its ability to sustain an interesting story both for the audiences who are and who are not willing to delve into the deeper aspects of what makes a film truly shine. Kick-Ass 2, on the other hand, seemingly aimed only to satisfy those who are not willing to dig. (But not entirely; I will get into that later). Simply put, if you walk into movies to see action, blood, and a whole lot of style, you will absolutely love Kick-Ass 2. However, if you walk into movies to see interesting characters, a well paced story, and a whole lot of substance, you will still admire Kick-Ass 2, but forget about it very soon. While there are few aspects from the deeper end of the spectrum residing within this film, that does not mean that they do not stand out and impress. Hit-Girl was a blast to watch in the first film. But unfortunately, her new-found sensitivities in this film seem to do nothing but take away from what mattered the most about her character in the first place in exchange for a few scenes of unnecessary high-school drama for the sake of developing a character in all the wrong spots. In spite of this, one character who stood out in a great way was Colonel Stars and Stripes who, in his mere seven and a half minutes of screen time, was an enormous bundle of interesting. Sadly, behind this among few more redeeming qualities lies the issues that many will have a hard time ignoring. The antagonist, who is notoriously known as The Motherf%#$er, is someone I found to be very bland and out-of-place in the Kick-Ass film universe created by the first film. Among a handful of humorous scenes he shared with Javier lies something we see every day in teenage comedies. Something worth forgetting about. Overall, Kick-Ass 2 is a great film for reasons that a lot of audiences do not find a film great for. However, if you allow it to take you to the spot it would like you to be (Which is a different mindset than what you had while watching the first) you should be in for a nice ride.",Kick-Ass 2
335,blacksheep241,Good but unoriginal,6,21 August 2013,"The original kickass was genius in my opinion, really one of my favourite movies ever, it was a real surprise and a fantastic new look at the superhero genre. Kickass 2 is lazy. Its kind of a chick-flick mixed with austin powers mixed with the incredibles, and it doesn't have an original idea in it. Its fun, its occasionally quite funny its fantastically acted, but from the moment head girl lost her way and went with the cool crowd, it lost its identity and became a huge disappointment that was a storyline we've seen so many times its just not funny anymore. The fact that there's what basically amounts to an advert for Cowells latest god awful boyband that lasts waaaay long than seems reasonable to say its just storyline was the final nail in its coffin for me and I struggled to enjoy it from that point. Maybe Im as hard on it as I am because I loved the first one so much I couldn't get to see this fast enough and it was impossible to live up to that expectation, but either way I hope there's a 3rd movie that rights this wrong",Kick-Ass 2
336,jonmatth7149,"Not bad, but could've been A LOT better.",6,19 September 2013,"After seeing the first film a few years ago, I've been waiting for a sequel to a movie, that I saw as a breath of fresh air, that had an original story, interesting characters, memorable scenes, not really seen before in movies, and a premise that basically satirized itself. However, after watching the sequel to Kick Ass, I left disappointed, even though I thought the movie was worth watching. Not to give any spoilers away, but I felt the movies plot focused too much on the situations, instead of the characters themselves. These movies, despite as realistic as they claim to be, have unrealistic story lines, and the plot is something that is an after thought to the characters. I wasn't at all surprised about where they went with the plot, but what I was shocked at was how much they did not take advantage of the new characters that were introduced. Each of the new characters in the movie, aka the super heroes, were inspired by Kick Ass, an outcast teen who dreams of being a super hero. That being said that means this really should be a band of misfits coming together to fight crime, each with their own quirky personas, that become memorable. However, I believe the main problem with this film is that they do not take advantage of these new characters enough, especially that of Jim Carrey. For it being a movie of this premise, I expected Carrey to steal the show, and his character is interesting enough, and he does a great job with the character, but he isn't in the movie long enough to have an established connection with the audience. ***SPOILER*** Carrey's character is only in the movie for half an hour and in only 3 scenes, one being his introduction, two being a mission they go on (which was too rushed btw) and three being his last scene. I will admit he is a bad ass in this film, and is respected as the leader by the other super heroes, but they only establish this with one short scene letting the audience know his back ground, which was right before his last scene. This is not enough to establish a character like this and by the end of the movie I left thinking he was a wasted character, that was supposed to be important, but could've easily been taken out of the plot entirely. I understand that the bulk of the movie is going to be focused on Kick Ass and Hit Girl, but why introduce all these new characters, and even get a guy like Jim Carrey, who really doesn't act like his comedic self and plays it more serious, if they're just going to be forgettable by the end? I will admit this could just be nitpicking, but looking at what I see as a movie with a similar basic premise, Mystery Men, they were able to introduce all these quirky characters, and allow the audience to build an attachment to them, without hurting the main focus of the movie. In this film, it just seems like they had a basic idea and didn't really want to create any establishment for the characters, they just introduced them, and expected you to accept them immediately. To me this is the biggest thing working against the movie and had Jim Carrey, AKA Colonial Stars and Stripes, been in the movie longer, as well as a focus being more on the rag tag band of crime fighters, then the movie would've been a lot better. 6/10, not a bad film, but I left wanting more, and will probably not get it, if they make Kick Ass 3.",Kick-Ass 2
337,turnerluke-880-195590,I like this movie a lot,9,17 January 2014,I liked this film because this is one of my favourite action films of all time in 2013 what I liked about this film is that most of the scenes are mostly action in all the scenes. I would recommend this film too everyone that is in too action films. the special effects in the film absolutely amazing you will love it if you watch this film but you will have too watch the first Kick-Ass before you watch the 2nd film. the script in the film is really funny in most of the films because there is such stars just like Jim Carrey and there is also really good actors that are brilliant actors/actress like Aaron Taylor Johnson and Chloe Grace Moretz. The genre for the film is action comedy and crime. At the start of the film the girl goes to school but doesn't stay she just goes too a training centre. At the end of the film there is a massive fighting scene. This scene was very exciting.,Kick-Ass 2
338,Brandonkzn,Awesome movie,10,15 March 2015,"This was a great movie. It was nice that they carried over the story from the original. Some people may think the movie was a bit stupid but this kept the character of the movie. The storyline was great and the humorous content mixed with the action really went well together. Bringing in new characters was a great plus. This just made the movie more interesting, as you could learn about the new characters and what there roles were in the movie. Personally believe that there was more action in the movie than the last one. It helps to keep you interested in the movie. Overall it was a great entertaining movie. I could easily watch it over and over again just like I did with the first kick ass movie. Hopefully they make a 3rd movie. That will be a must see!!",Kick-Ass 2

Click on the posting history and you see that this person has posted in a hundred threads all on the Kickass 2 board, nowhere else.Reality - for people who aren't paid to talk this movie up, this movie isn't good. If you loved the first one or the comic then I am sure you probably would like this too...that's what the 7.1 rating reflects...9s and 10s from superfans and paid agents. But for the casual movie watcher, this isn't worth your time. The first one was okay as far as violent excess goes, but without Cage this one doesn't have an anchor and just meanders through a retreat of the first movie's plot along with a subplot of Hit Girl learning to be a normal teen. This subplot is a weak parody of Mean Girls that wastes a lot of time that Moretz could have otherwise spent as Hit Girl, and the ensuing potty humor is some of the most ridiculous I've ever seen.Sometimes critics are wrong, but not this time. Bad, bad movie. You go outside now.",Kick-Ass 2
340,PaulsReview,Kick Ass 2 Review! No Spoilers!,8,21 August 2013,"Kick Ass 2 follows directly on from number 1, featuring the same main stars as 1, Kick Ass and Hit-Girl! These 2 own the show, and Chloe Grace Moretz (Hit-Girl) really does a good job of keeping her tough super hero character going! Not to take anything away from Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Kick Ass) as he does a good job, but he really does come across as the Robin in a Batman And Robin movie, a role he mentions in the movie that he is only too happy to play.The Action is good as these 2 super-heroes, and their team of Merry men and women battle against their arch nemesis the bad guy Chris D'Amico (who you will remember as Red Mist but gets a new title in the second movie), who decides he wants to become the ultimate bad guy, so follows the rules of bad guys and recruits a team of mindless bad guys and girls who are out to kill whoever gets in their way! And like the first, Kick Ass does not go unscathed, he managed to get beaten up several times, which adds to the comical side of the movieThe language is a little more tame then the first one, but only just, and the fight scenes can be somewhat graphic, tho I wouldn't put in the gross category, just gory enough to be realistic, as people get stabbed, killed and there's even a hand being cut off!Now I was a fan of the first kick-ass movie so I was quite eager to watch this and I think basing it on what i got out the first then i am going to rate it quite well. The acting was of a high standard, the story-line was very well connected to the first, for me to enjoy following it as a decent sequel. The script wasn't corny and for a super-hero action it was extremely realistic. I think without Nicholas Cage in the movie, all 3 actors (if you include the ""bad guy"") have stepped up well into their roles. But I think if you weren't a fan of the first, then you can probably give this a miss, and if you haven't seen the first, MAKE sure you watch it first to really understand what's going on!One of the Best qualities of this movie, there is NO LOVE STORY! and it works well! The audience this is aimed at I would imagine would be teens and younger adults, tho I have no doubt many older adults will just enjoy some Kick-Ass action and his goofy qualities.",Kick-Ass 2

Not about super- powered superheroes. Not about how cool a person is. It's about real people wanting to actually do something good, but their humanity is standing on the way.

Reading through the majority of reviews posted about Kick Ass2, I'm beginning to think that some people were watching a different movie! It was a disaster from start to finish. The acting was poor and the storyline was very flimsy. It seemed to me that the movie was built around blood, guts, stunt fights and a pathetic attempt to show Mindy trying to be a normal tween. Any scenes that featured The Motherf**ker were ridiculous and cringe-worthy. The best character in the movie was the dog. I can understand why Jim Carrey walked away from promoting this movie.

I truly love this movie's idealism! The sincerity of its heroes is fully embraced, never mocked. There is not a single trace of cynicism directed towards these aspiring champions.""Kick-Ass 2"" deals with the pain, loss and consequences of standing up to and taking action against injustice, while inspiring bystanders to get off their butts and stop sitting on the sidelines.There's method to the violent madness of Kick-Ass 2. Its moral is clear: when you're a superhero with no actual super powers, an ordinary citizen with nothing but good intentions backing up your actions, the personal cost of morality and bravery is dear, and death is a very real possibility. Loved ones may be lost, but that loss only makes these honorable young superheroes more determined to fight all the harder. What's not to love? If you want humor, it's cram-packed in. If you want action, it delivers stupendously! If you want the bent vulgarity and violence worthy of a Kick-Ass movie, I promise you, you won't be disappointed. And if you want to meet a ton of cool new superheroes and villains, don't miss this film!!! This movie fully achieves its goal: creating a cartoon world of real people trying to live up to and be worthy of the superheroes they think that they each may actually be inside, while poking fun at everyone and everything along the way. And while coming to terms with all their internal conflicted voices as they are growing through their teen years and into who they really are.I loved it, it was highly entertaining.

Even repeating some of the first movie it separates nicely from other movies of they kind. Brutality and darkness can shock viewer even if you have seen the first movie. This movie has a unique way to play motions in comedy. There is also lot of scenes u can't be prepared for. How many times you stop to think what just happened? Ending is the only part that i did not like so much and i'we had this spider-man theme in my head too many times. Thats why i don't give 10.

It shows a perspective of heroes like in no other movies. Like in reality.The action scenes have a taste of fantasy, since some of them are impossible in real life, however they flow discretely in the reality of the story.My favorite character is of course Hit-Girl, not only because she is kicking ass, but as well because I am so damn in love with Chloe, I would marry her.I was a little bit disappointed that Hit-Girl had to leave however, I hope there will be a 3rd part of this movie and i can't wait for it.After all, Motherf*cker survived a shark, so it would be a waste if he will not be once again a pain to Kick-Ass's ass.",Kick-Ass 2

No dull moments, and there was actual moments of reflection. If we took the position of Hit Girl it was written and played well. The cast was great lots of fan favorites doing their thing. Realism ? Of course not, Pure Kicks. I'm ready for another installment to this series it's certainly better than most. Keeping in mind the light faire element of the flick whats next. Good job.

349,littlemisshyper15,Such a let down,5,31 August 2013,"I am a massive fan of the 1st Kick-Ass movie. I went to see it in the cinema 3 times I loved it that much. Kick-Ass 2 was, in my opinion, such a let down. I just didn't get itWhy all of a sudden can everyone and anyone join in and become a super hero just because they think it's cool? Why were they all prepared to risk their lives when they didn't seem to even be aware of the back- story? Why were they all triumphant in the end when we didn't see them train, become physically fit or even have weapons? I think this was the thing that I disliked the most - instead of focusing solely on Dave and Mindy, it became diluted.It started to go downhill when The MotherF recruited all those hard core nut jobs. In the 1st movie there was always a purpose behind the violence, in this movie, it was mindless violence. The MotherF seemed to turn evil which kind of ruined his whole character from the previous film. I wasn't expecting Jim Carrey to be any good as Colonel Stars and Stripes but he was pretty good so why did he have to be killed off so quickly? He was the only one out of the ""team"" that could have done any damage at all.In the 1st movie a lot of emphasis was placed on the cool weapons, slow- mo's and soundtrack. There were barely any cool weapons, no slow-mo's and the soundtrack was effectively the song used in the opening sequence throughout the entire movie.The ending was very rushed. We weren't given the opportunity to grieve for the loss of Dave's father and neither was he. All of a sudden, there was this big show down in The MotherF's ""evil lair"" in which Kick- Ass had a boring fight with The MotherF. Kick Ass had been training throughout the whole film and we didn't even get to see any of his moves. He could have kicked the sh out of The MotherF but instead they just fumbled about. There was just no build up or purpose. The only good thing about the movie was Mindy, she remained cool, and Dave's 6 pack.",Kick-Ass 2

The Action and the Comedy were superb, and Chloe Grace Moretz was once again stunning in her role as Hit-Girl and Mindy, the rest of the cast did a solid job and Jim Carrey could have replaced Nick Cage if he had gotten a little more Screen Time but i'm happy that they stayed true to the comic in this regard. The Problem why Kick-Ass 2 falls short off being on one level with its predecessor is the fact that the movie sets its focus on events which are just not that interesting. The whole High-School/Mindy Sub-Plot takes up to much time and other Parts of the Story are given way to less attention. Another thing thats bothering me is the portrayal of Chris D'Amico. Like in the first movie (i hate the Red Mist Costume) he comes across way to wimpy and not nearly psychotic and ruthless enough. But these are minor flaws which did not really limit my enjoyment of this movie, and i'm confident that Kick-Ass 3 will be another solid entry in the franchise.",Kick-Ass 2
351,devilgirl1667,Very good,10,2 February 2014,"I liked it even better than the first movie. A starting hero and a little fighting girl was great, but the second part of story was a little better. I saw more of characters every day life and they weren't only superheroes anymore. But I admit that I hoped to see some romance between Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl, because it seemed logical. But I never read the comic book before I saw the movie. Costumes were awesome. Soundtracks were great too. What I didn't like, was deaths of Dave's father and of course Chris. In some way it felt wrong. Too bad that Hit- Girl left town in the end, kind of sad. However, this ending gave the impression that I can expect the third movie too, which I like a lot.",Kick-Ass 2
352,Cookiedough1996,best sequel ever!,10,15 August 2013,"Honestly, I wasn't expecting much of this film - I thought it would be much worse than the first (as a lot of sequels tend to be) - especially since Nicolas Cage didn't star in this one.Oh, boy, was I wrong. It was so much better than the last - with more action, more laughs and more mayhem. It has been one of the best sequels I have ever seen (along with ""the dark knight"" and the third and fourth ""mission impossible"" films)So, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who also loves comedy/action films - as it was an awesome film! ...it really did kick ass. ;)",Kick-Ass 2
353,Swashbucklist,Most of what made the original special is still there,7,16 August 2013,"I heard it said that ""Kick-Ass 2"" was a decent superhero movie that didn't quite live up to its predecessor's best moments. After seeing it, I would be surprised if the majority of the Kick-Ass fan-base didn't agree. There was superhero action aplenty, a few good laughs (especially from Christopher Mintz-Plasse), grim, painful moments that made the fist movie so visceral and intense, and reappearances of almost every great theme; if Omen wasn't in there, it's probably because the diner fight from the first film was Kick-Ass's defining moment, and should stay that way.But as mentioned, there were a few areas in which it didn't succeed. Matthew Vaughn did several things with ""Kick-Ass"" that gave it a special, genuine, compelling quality; things that Jeff Wadlow failed to imitate. As good a director as Wadlow is, his Kick-Ass is a little cheaper than Vaughn's Kick-Ass.Firstly, one of the ideas Matthew Vaughn had when filming was avoiding the use of dramatic angles to dramatize the experience of any given scene. He would have the camera stand back to film the actors doing their thing, and let the drama speak for itself. Jeff Wadlow uses those dramatic, cinematic camera angles and cuts. He didn't put anywhere near as much energy and movement into the camera-work as Michael Bay does, but it wouldn't have hurt to pull back a little. Comparing ""Kick-Ass 2"" to its predecessor is a bit like comparing a McG movie to a Shawn Levy movie (""Terminator: Salvation"" to ""Real Steel""). Not quite that big of a gap, but you get the picture.Secondly, although Jeff Wadlow is very skilled at pacing a movie, his style doesn't fit Kick-Ass. In his films, no scene is longer than it needs to be, and they convey enough information to move onto the next shot without feeling rushed. But compared to the first ""Kick-Ass"", the second one is indeed rushed. Vaughn offers a little more time to draw his scenes out, and that let us enjoy some of the movie's truly special moments, like the Flying Home sequence. Wadlow delivers things more concisely, making the sequel move just a bit too quickly for my liking. There were several frames, such as the reveal of Colonel Stars and Stripes, that were cut too short to allow a viewer to bask in the moments happening on screen.Then there's the use of CGI. Without giving too much away, there are moments herein that utilized it with sorry results. This movie's equivalent of ""With great power..."" is ""This isn't a comic book, this is real life""...a key element from the first movie in the form of a memorable quote. Unfortunately, there are several moments (notably the climactic showdown) that are set up and executed with such obviously fake backdrops and digital enhancements that they look exactly like the comic book movies the characters are openly disavowing. The cinematic intensity that the first movie eschewed—and was thus made compelling by doing so—rears its ugly head here for the sake of entertainment.So it has its flaws, but it's still a great followup to a great superhero movie. Despite feeling more like ""Dick Tracy"" than ""Superbad"" like it's supposed to, it's not all bad. The music is decent, the characters are still very much themselves, and most of the hallmarks are still there. Anyone who loved the first movie should enjoy this one, too.",Kick-Ass 2
354,walkingtall202,Justice Forever!,9,17 August 2013,"Forget Nolan's Batman or Snyder's superman. Mark Miller's Kick-Ass is the most accurate depiction of Superheroes I've ever seen. It shows you the good and bad side of trying to do what is right. After seeing Kick-Ass 2 it made me want to become a superhero, but i didn't due the fear of death. Everyone can relate to Kick-Ass, while hardly anyone can relate to Spider- man, Batman, Iron man, and no one can relate to Superman. So far I have only read Kick ass 2's comic book counter part and it was equally as good as the film.

BUT BETTER,8,16 August 2013,"Understandably, as a fan of the first Kick Ass film, Kick Ass 2 was right up my alley, but I was completely blind-sided by the fact that it went above and beyond it predecessor.To be fair, in Kick Ass 2, the plot did leave something to be desired for, certainly not the most original or creative, but what do you really expect from it? What really set the movie on fire was the depth that was added to the characters, especially Hit Girl. In the first film her character was fairly flat, almost completely if it weren't for her relationship with her father. In the sequel however, her human side really is explored, although it's through over used clichés and stereotypes, we get to see that despite the costume and lost childhood, Hit Girl truly is that, a teenage GIRL.Anyways, I strongly suggest this movie to anyone, especially those who were fans of the first. I can say that it was the most fun I have had in a movie theatre for a long time.",Kick-Ass 2

Meaningful parts will resonate with you, more than you think.We might not be superheroes but we are never in a position in which we have nothing to work with. We all have capacities, talents, direction, missions, callings.When the end credits started I thought to myself ""I want a third instalment ."" I rated it this high because the film succeeds in everything it wants to accomplish.I caught a screening with two of my best friends and all of us enjoyed it throughout.

357,ferpuerto17,My favorite movie of the year so far,10,17 August 2013,"I am always critical of superhero movies because I love comic books, but I am finding it extremely hard to be critical of Kick-Ass 2. The movie is awesome to say the least and if you read the critics you may get a different idea. DO NOT LISTEN TO MOVIE CRITICS ON THIS ONE!!! Critics really do not enjoy these films but superhero and comic book fans will love it. The movie has action, humor (dark humor), a bit of gore, and for a second my girlfriend even got a little choked up because of the scenes... (ok it was me, she was totally fine).I think the character of Hit-Girl takes over the movie even when she is not in costume and the final fight with Mother Russia is epic... Will not give spoilers except to say those eyes when the fight gets turned around; just made me laugh a lot.It is too bad that Jim Carey decided not to promote the movie, because the Colonel may be his best role in ten years. He was funny and there is an emotional scene where you actually see his acting actually be better than much of what he has done.Go see the movie, you will enjoy it",Kick-Ass 2
358,gkdobby14,"Good, but not as good as the first",8,15 September 2013,"So kick-ass 2 has its ups and downs but overall does the first justice and is a good movie, however I get why people don't like it, although I do believe they are completely overreacting. So this is why they are getting slightly angered by this action sequel. The director has changed which means the whole feel of the movie has changed, and me personally, I hated this and noticed it from the start. Is this so bad though? The second comic book was darker, so is this new director just following the tone of the comic or is he trying to fix something which isn't broken. People complain about about the 2 recasting s, honestly I didn't notice until I was told. And the two characters don't make too much appearances so it doesn't matter to much. The two best things about this movie are colonel Stars and Stripes (jim Carrey) and hit girl (Chloe Moretz) aren't in the film enough. Both playing excellent roles. The use of character development on Mindy Macready is one of the things the director did perfectly. All I'm saying is you could have also put colonel Stars and Stripes in more scenes! The drama in this movie was great especially in the scene with the mean girls. The majority of the comedy for me was wasted in the trailer and the camera work and editing was terrible. Why shake the camera on a fight scene like you are on a trampoline? There is no point. It ruined the otherwise awesome fight scenes. In the scene where Mindy shoots Dave, the camera angle changes so much you barely understand what's going on. Taking all this into account, the storyline was great, the film was extremely enjoyable but the director needs to change for the third, or he needs to learn how to use a camera.",Kick-Ass 2
359,rywolf8,"Darker, more violent, and nowhere near as good.",2,12 October 2013,"I am a huge fan of the first Kick-Ass movie; it was fun, action packed, and even had a few emotional sequences thrown in for good measure. I went into the sequel expecting the same feel of the first one to be present, but just a continuation of the story. That, unfortunately, was where I was horribly wrong.Lots and lots of spoilers for Kick-Ass 2 below...Alright, so it starts off pretty good, with Hit-Girl and Kick-Ass training to be a crime fighting duo. I'm excited about this...I would be cool with a movie entirely about KA and HG putting down bad guys. But then HG makes a promise to Marcus, her guardian and protector since her father died, and subsequently stops being a super hero and spends the rest of the movie trying to fit in with teenage 'mean girls' super clique b**ches. Um, what?? Which then leaves her and KA's interaction through the rest of the movie to essentially him begging her to come back and be a hero and she repeating over and over again why she can't. They literally have this conversation like five times.Don't even get me started on the ""Sick Stick"" she uses to get her revenge on the girls at school. It's a cool weapon in theory, but the graphic portrayal of its use in the middle of a high school cafeteria was repulsive and completely unnecessary.Here's something I never thought I would say; I wish Jim Carrey had been in the movie more. His character actually seemed like it could be pretty interesting; hints about a spec ops past, an attitude that borders (well, maybe more than borders...) psychotic, like he could easily push being a hero too far. Even though it is a cliché story, I would have much rather seen his character devolve into a morally grey killer as the villain than what was given to us with Christopher Mintz-Plasse.I liked Chris in the first movie, teenage son to a powerful mob boss trying to figure out where he fits, but still with some sense of moral integrity. None of that is seen here; so consumed with Kick Ass after the masked hero killed his father with a bazooka, he dons his mothers S&M outfit and becomes the first supervillain, the Mother F****er. Yep. That's right. I'm sure this is supposed to be funny, but they portray him as too dark, violent, and serious while trudging around in leather and chains for me to feel anything but nausea during every scene he is in.I missed Nicholas Cage. Another thing I never thought I would say.Character's do things for no reason throughout the whole movie, the dialogue is terrible, the movie is just awful. It's redeeming qualities are few and far between, and not enough to make it worth a viewing. There is a lot more about this movie that upsets me (like Dave's gf from the first movie breaking up with him because she thought he and Hit-Girl were sleeping together...??) but I think I have probably said more than enough.Watch the first Kick-Ass, it is awesome. Give this one a wide berth.",Kick-Ass 2

But they joined good guy team ""justice forever""The comedy is gold, only one scene that almost made fun of rape is not funny, every joke gets laughs some are big some are small.Comedy isn't what is not what KA2 will be remembered for, because the action scenes are just flawlessly cringe worthy, without being too gory. There is A LOT of action in Kick-ass 2 than its predecessor, and thats saying something.The Heroes, Kick-ass, Hit-girl, Colonel stars and stripes, Night- bitch,Dr. Gravity, battle guy, ETC.

It picked up right where the last left off but he didn't need much info or recapping from me to go strait to it. We both loved it and we're consistently laughing at the ridiculous lines and situations the characters are put in. Characters: the reason I liked the characters so much is because the characters aren't over the top out of costume. To explain, Mindy (hit girl) is the ""I'm a bad girl that don't need nobody) routine that seems to be getting used a lot lately. But out of the mask she is vulnerable and fights with growing up. Kick ass is every awkward nerds hero because he fights for the week when even as a hero, is week himself. The villain of the movie Chris D'amico is absolutely great as a sad hurt neglected vengeful kid trying his hardest to fill the shoes of his old man! It was awesome to see how far and dark he was willing to get but still seemed like a goob throughout the whole transformation.

This Ass-Kicker of a movie had a much darker tone but overall it was much more mature and had just the right balance of action and laughs. Jim Carrey, although he has decided not to support the film was the ultimate highlight however as Colonel Stars and Stripes and he stole the show as a mob enforcer born again Christian who assembles the Justice Forever team to ultimately Kick- Ass!

I felt as if I got to drive a Lamborghini and was told that I was going to get to drive something better but was offered a pair of skates instead. This sequel seemed to me as if it was directed by a school kid. I was expecting better fight scenes in this movie. I especially was expecting Dave to have learned to fight like HG in the time between first and second movie. There seemed to be ideas from other movies in KA2 as if it was a Scary Movie series. There were some good parts but not enough of them to win me over to say I want to see this movie again. I don't care how gruesome the violence was but nothing compared to to what I saw at the end of movie in last scene with Dave and Mindy. If there is a KA3, the only way I'd go see it is if director of first movie was directing it. I hope they don't plan to make too many KA2 DVDs to sell.",Kick-Ass 2
364,matthew-s-surprenant,Missed its own point somehow,6,18 August 2013,"I usually shy away from reviewing films online. There are tons of others out there to do that, but when a movie sticks in my head for more than a day after seeing it, I get compelled.Now, I want to judge this essentially as a standalone. I don't expect a sequel to mimic the style of the first entirely. That allows things to get stale too quickly.First, the premise of the film is great and it is filmed well. Nothing really stands out as lacking in terms of production value. Some have commented on the musical score having no set identity, and I can see the point. It jumps from recycled score material to modern club music and all around, but that didn't detract anything for me much at all. I noticed it, and in that sense it did draw me out of the film from time to timejust not as much as other elements.With Kick-Ass 2, my brain is wracked by how many missed opportunities there were. Every plot element was essential, however, the execution of each one was quite restrained. Where tension could've been created by overlapping elements and allowing the film to break its own barriers, the viewer got nothing but contained subplots in almost a chained sequence. For instance, Mindy was socially awkward, but who she was as Hit-Girl never fully collided with her at-school personality. She acts out some, but her identity as a hero is all too easily restrained when she's focused on high school social elements. Beyond that, there was a lot of melodrama, especially in the first ½ of the movie. The 2nd half is where the plot finally got intense. Alas, it failed to stun me in many instances. The action scenes were great, but I never felt in fear for the lives of the absolutely main characters. Only add-ins went the way of the dodo, which made their roles all too limited. That sense of peril that can truly bring a film to life simply wasn't there.In the end, the character development fell flat. It was a regaining of their identities, but the characters never grew. Any realizations had were smacked in the face of the audience. Ultimately, what the film needed was more fitting attitude with itself. The seriousness was too present. If the movie had the mindset of letting itself cut loose and be silly once in a while, going directions it could just for the pure fun of it, the serious moments would've been miles more impactful and left a more satisfied feeling to be had. Rather, it was the rigamarole of good versus evil getting drawn out. The character of Kick-Ass was rarely conflicted until the last 1/3 of the movie, as were most all the others. What's stranger is rather than ramping up the stakes physically in a logical manner, the main characters were able to take less of a beating than one would expect (in some scenes) to create a false sense of urgency, and that simply made the style contrite. In energetic scenarios, the good guys were essentially invincible. More dramatic scenes made the characters weaker for the sake of plot convenience. In the end, the medley was difficult to digest.To summarize, all I have to say is opportunities were missed. The sequences, each scene as an individual entity, were terrific. The combination of it all didn't leave me itching for more, but wanting more from what I'd just witnessed. The balance needed wasn't there. A re- edit would be fine by me.Alas, I don't regret seeing the film. In fact, a lot of content was crammed into the hour and forty-three minutes it had. So many sequences were chained together a second viewing may be in line down the road for the sake of digesting them further. If a third picture came out, I'd still watch it. The plot has potential galore and even if this film didn't act on it, there's more than enough buildup to create a wild and crazy third movie.In the word's of the colonel, ""Try and have fun with it. Otherwise, what's the point?""",Kick-Ass 2
365,jremyu,not good as the first but so what,7,28 August 2013,"Maybe the best movie of the year so far, definitely the best superhero movie, a few notches above The Wolverine. Rated R superhero movies don't come around too often and it's shame that the ""evil"" part Hollywood won with Kick-Ass 2 not making too much unfortunately. In addition to rated R superhero movies almost never getting made, they are usually low budget. A bigger budget would have helped make the climax a little more epic but overall, the movie was nicely made, looked just like the first Kick-Ass. Just a couple things I didn't like. The nudity, although very short was totally unnecessary. The trailers for this movie seems it would be way more appealing to a younger audience with all the colorful costumes and funny stuff which would would hurt any R film. Some parents don't mind taking younger kids to a movie with violence and bad words but nudity is a different story, big mistake for a movie like this. I heard rumors of a rape scene which I didn't wanna see and feel like it would have been way out of place in Kick-Ass. I'm not gonna give anything away but I would have liked it if they just wanted to beat up a certain character from the start.

The film had great comedy points such as Jim Carrey's character Colonel Stars and Stripes and the fact that a 15 year old girl is swearing more than an old man with torrets!...

The violence is downright absurd, but when you have villains with names like; 'The Mother F****r', 'Genghis Carnage' and 'Black Death', it would be silly if it wasn't gratuitous! This film surely does lives up to its genre of Action/Comedy.. And more, it's everything you dream of as a child, contrasted with the cruel reality of the real world, where actions do have consequences. It made me feel like I was taking this insane journey with Kick Ass and sincere emotions were felt when he suffers. It might be questionable that I think this title has more of an emotional impact than such titles as '7 Pounds' or the 'The Notebook' but hey! That's my opinion! The death's of lead characters are still as heart felt as the death of Big Daddy in Kick Ass and the soundtrack is yet again impeccable! (even if there is a cameo performance from Union J). However, the only time I felt uncomfortable watching this film was during the scene where a supposed 15 year old girl dances rather provocatively in one of Hit Girl's gym classes.

I wouldn't say that this film was going to win any Oscars based on the purpose which is to entertain and amaze us with the film creating talent that so many modern directors have. The violence in the film is some what comic but serious also, in every film there is that one character that deserves to have the wrath of the coolest and strongest character. When hit-girl played by Chloe finally finished mother Russia, I as a part of the audience felt somewhat relieved that the biggest, strongest and meanest villain got what she had coming.On the other hand I could see why some people would disagree with the film's suggestive theme of high schoolers murdering people for the great of good which could give a bad opinion for all comical comic book based films.I loved this film and it was a great representation of how to keep the level of comedy consistent in a film pair such as these.",Kick-Ass 2
372,rutman3000,Disappointing and Frustrating,6,16 August 2013,"This could have been such a good movie, but it just wasn't. I really feel like the filmmakers didn't know what made the first one so good.What we wanted: More of Hit Girl being Hit girl. The stuff in high school was okay but was way too long. She needed to get back to being Hit Girl MUCH SOONER. Hit Girl is the star, why pretend otherwise? Should have had lots more scenes with her, beating up muggers, picking off the bad guys one by one, etc, etc... More of Kick Ass kicking some Ass. Come on, in the opening he is training with Hit Girl, he later reveals huge muscles, but rarely does he seem to now how to use his skills or muscles to fight a bad guys. At times he seems weaker than in the first movie, it just doesn't make sense. A Better Ending. In the first movie Hit Girl and Kick ass take on lots, and lots of bad guys by themselves.Why do they need a bunch of ill-trained losers to fight with them?  It would have been better if just Hit Girl and Kick Ass took on the army of bad guys. Include lots of ""Hit Girl moments"" and even some good ""Kick Ass moments"" and perhaps end with his friend flying in on the jet pack, from the first movie, to take out a spare bad guy or two.What we got:Instead we get hit girl getting beaten up for most of the ending before finally being victorious, and Kick ass kills the bad guy who is admittedly a wimp but it takes a dramatic battle to win. And somehow in the background all the ""pretend"" super heroes defeat an army of trained killers mostly off screen. The ending is a cluster and unsatisfying.It just doesn't make sense, the action in this movie is nowhere near as good as the first one. They should have kept the original writer/director from Kick Ass 1. I'm not sure why Hollywood thinks it's a good idea to replace a proved director/writer who has already made a successful movie. That was a poor choice and it shows. As I said, disappointing. And because it's not likely to make much money, I doubt there will be a 3rd movie and a chance to redeem the series.I've seen much worse sequels, so I gave this a 6, but I was really expecting an 8 or 9 movie. The sad part is they had all the pieces, but put them together poorly. Wait for the video, skip the theater.",Kick-Ass 2
373,alocalvoice,Good Sequel,6,17 August 2013,"I've been trying to think of what to say about ""Kick Ass 2"". First, don't go see it if you haven't seen ""Kick Ass"" as the sequel doesn't really stand alone too well. A few years have gone by; Dave and Mindy are struggling to adjust to their new lives. Dave is bored out of his mind having had a taste of real crime fighting and is stuck back in high school. Mindy is trying to adjust to a new adopted father who wants her crime fighting days to stay in the past, though Hit Girl still is doing her own thing, as well as dealing with her new adolescence. Dave approaches Mindy about them ""teaming up"" and joining all the new ""super"" heroes that have cropped up since their last adventure. However, as in the comic books, the rise of super heroes also gives rise to super villains, a la ""X Men United"". In Kick Ass, the producers were able to keep a real comic book feel to the movie, which went really well with the plot, but that is lost in Kick Ass 2. I think the language and violence is about the same (a lot), though the tone of Kick Ass 2 seems more serious and edgy. There is also a brief shot with nudity that has nothing to do with the plot. As in the first movie Chloe Grace Moretz (Mindy) steals the show and not just as Hit Girl either. Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Dave) does a great job in reprising his role as Kick Ass and Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Chris D'amico/Red Mist) definitely goes psycho and takes on a much more brutal persona, with a new super villain name that I won't repeat. This is not a movie for young people. I didn't find Kick Ass 2 as enjoyable/fun as Kick Ass, because of it's serious tone, but I think it is a good sequel, which is really hard to find these days. All things taken into consideration, I think I would give it a rating of 6. If you were a fan of Kick Ass, check it out.",Kick-Ass 2
374,McBamf,Aimless Sequel That Doesn't Kick Much Ass,6,19 August 2013,"I must say that the first Kick-Ass is one of my all-time favorite action movies. It had all the stylings of a great action flick: gritty fight scenes, finesse fight scenes,explosions, rocket launchers, and one-liners that would send Mom to the soap aisle. The difference-maker, though--at least, to me--is that it was honest with itself. For every choice the main character, Dave, made, there was a consequence. Becoming a hero in the real world meant real risk. And I think Kick-Ass did a great job showing that while retaining just a little of the cartoonishness that helps keep the audience at a safe distance. It wasn't a superhero movie. It was a movie about someone wanting to do good in the world, with nothing but his bare hands and some batons. OK. All that gushing about the first movie serves a purpose. Which is, to put it bluntly, that the sequel is its ugly cousin. Kick-Ass 2 has no idea what to do with itself. It has about as much direction as the Scarecrow from Wizard of Oz. Whereas the first film was almost a dialogue about the consequences our choices have, the second is just rudderless gibberish going wherever the wind takes it. The action is there, and there are even some great one liners (my favorite is subtitled from Russian toward the end, see if you can guess it). But it lacks the vision of its predecessor. It doesn't aim to say much, rather it just wants to open its mouth. To make things even worse, I took issue with some of the casting decisions. One of the characters from the first film has one scene and is subsequently written out of the movie with no afterthought, while another character is recast altogether. I would rather these people not be in the movie at all than having them there just to say you do. It comes off tacky to have them in there for the sake of what, legacy? I won't say this film is unwatchable, because it isn't. In fact, if you're not emotionally invested in the first movie like I am, you might even enjoy this one. But I've always seen the first Kick-Ass as a cleverly disguised dissertation on what it truly means to step up and take action against something, and dealing with what comes with it. Kick-Ass 2 is more of a doodle on a napkin: it can be fun, but it doesn't mean anything.",Kick-Ass 2

It was more a movie about Hit-Girl than Kick-Ass and that's fine because she's the one who really knows how to ""Kick-Ass"", pardon the pun. The critics should ""MotherF***er"" themselves to use some inappropriate language from the movie. This isn't the Brady Bunch and the violence is over the top but it doesn't actually show the extreme stuff like a beheading so stop bashing the movie for being an R-Rated action flick! Best Superhero: Hit-Girl of course! Best Villain: Mother Russian (Ivan Drago wishes he could be her).",Kick-Ass 2

The first kick ass movie is one of my all time favorite films and I have to say kick ass 2 is even bigger & better than the first one. Kick ass 2 has double the action, great funny bits through out, and the ensemble cast is amazing. The mother****** and Jim Carry really steal the show, but then again all the actors were great. It seems like this movie should be getting better reviews, because everyone I have talked to loved it and said they think it is as good, or better than the original.

377,the-reel-mrs-nesbitt,"Kicks less ass, but makes you care...",8,20 August 2013,"Undoubtedly the original Kick-Ass had more ass kicking, but Kick-Ass 2 focuses on making its characters human. Kick-Ass 2 achieved something its predecessor could not; it made me care!The film focuses on the repercussions of taking up the mantle of ""superhero"" and the harm that can come from peoples' actions. Just like the original it subverts our expectations. It teases the idealistic and heroic choices made in comic books and films and conveys that there is often a very real (and painful) consequence to ""heroic"" actions.The film spends time of building the human side to its characters. It does slow down the pace of the film and the build up of action is not as seamless or stylish as the original. However in my opinion, this does not hinder the movie, but gives it more heart.I was drawn to the movie, because I love superhero fiction and I enjoyed Kick-Ass's humour and over-the-top action! However, it's for certain I will be returning for the story and its characters in Kick-Ass 3. Thank you Kick-Ass 2, you got me hooked!",Kick-Ass 2

I'm not sure if it was because the movie was ""kick ass"" or that seeing it with friends was a great idea, either way I left the movie theater satisfied. Not only was I laughing, my friends were. And truthfully they are hard to humor. For me personally it kicks Man of Steel's ass any day. It was by far the best movie of the summer. It was fun and action packed. Movies like this don't come around that often.Overall, this movie blew away my expectations. It had great acting; an excellent Aaron Taylor Johnson, a stunning Chloe Grace Moretz, and of course, a hysterical Christopher Mintz-Plasse.

You may even say it's a bit tedious. In the sequel however, you don't have that anymore and they sure wasted all that time very well. It was way better than the first movie on so many levels, it was funnier, more extreme and sadder as well.And for those who are planning to go, there is a part after the end credits and it is worth the waiting. After all, it's a Marvel movie.To me this was the best movie I've seen this year.",Kick-Ass 2

I lowered my expectations significantly, i mean, a 28% on Rottentomatoes? come on.The movie was excellent for what it is, solid acting,especially from Jim Carrey and Christopher-mintz plasse.Good pacing, although i wouldn't have minded it being a little longer.I do have a couple of gripes. Some action scenes had annoying shaky cam for some reason and at times the movie starts to take itself too seriously, it's dangling back and forth over the line of too much.The first one didn't take itself seriously at all, it was just fun,fantasy,some shocking awesome violence and profanity.This one is like that,but like i said, the movie almost turns into a drama at some points, dances around it at least, but after the drama scene it's like ''hey,let's kill some fuc**n bad guys''.I really liked the movie,just enjoy it for what it is and don't expect it to be just quite like the first one and you'll be fine.

So don't pretend you are scared because of his violence or feigned about bloodshed must be justified, this is not an art movie, specialty film, or experimental film.Super heroes that can not exist in real life, that's the greatness of Kick-Ass, trying to bring closer the fanciful idea about anyone can be a Batman, a Black Widow and even a Superman.",Kick-Ass 2

(short review no spoilers),10,4 September 2013,"This is my first ever movie review review and I do not plan on going into a lot of detail as I want people to go see the movie and judge for themselves, The following is my opinion. As a fan of the first film and a collector of the comic book series I was incredibly happy with this movie. I was extremely excited as I took my seat in the movie theater and I was not in the slightest bit disappointed when the film concluded. The acting was brilliant, the script was funny and had emotion. When you sit down to watch ether Kick-Ass one or two you know you are watching a special movie that was made out of love for the comics/story rather than a studio looking for another quick cash in. Kick-Ass two is a comedy with a lot of heart and in my opinion it was my favorite movie of the year. Thanks for reading.",Kick-Ass 2
387,theworldclown,Kick-Ass 2 was something else,6,10 September 2013,"I really enjoyed the first Kick-Ass. Not much story tells you about how being a super hero in real life could turns out to be, and by doing that with such creative, brutally, mind-blowing way, add up with some nice taste of humor and sarcasm, Kick-Ass totally made me thrilled. Kick-Ass 2? Well, fewer laugh. But, you know what they said about quality vs quantity. And yet, it's not even the point. Kick-Ass 2 is still kick ass, but...it was something else.Like I just said, I really enjoyed the first Kick-Ass. But, frankly, I like the image of a dorky guy who stands up and get sh** throwing at his face, and still standing up; the image of a 12 yrs old girl killer who got more balls than all the men combine; the image of a whole-hearted, but insane father; I watched the whole movie and all I really excited about was the basic images of all of them, but not them. I don't care about Kick-Ass or Hit-Girl that much. Like when I saw an action fan-made videos or kinda stuffs, I could have watched them all over again and screaming, because they were amazing. But for sure, I wouldn't bother look up things about those guys on the videos. I don't care. They don't make me care about the characters.But Kick-Ass 2 did. It was more brutal. I was more ""grey"". It made the characters dealing with more mature, more serious problems other than just hero and idealistic stuffs, and even though you can easily predict the way it would turn out, watching them suffered through great loss, cried and collapsed, it pushed the characters a lot closer to you. You know those could be the things that happen to your neighbors, your friends or even you, and somewhat, you could really feel the pain. There are some scenes that really moved me and for the first time, they made me care for Kick-Ass.(Slightly Spoiler ahead, skip this part if you want) I've read some reviews beforehand and most of the disappointment about the movie point to the Hit-Girl ""weak"" plot. They said she had been softened up, messing around with teenage-girl craps while the world out there in vain (though most of them were mainly because they had to see Hit-Girl lack ""in action""). But I see no reason to moan, 'cause it's not *that* weak and in a way, her changing process was the only thing that make sense. I mean, come on, she might be a supreme crime fighter but SHE IS STILL A 15 YEARS OLD GIRL, with a stolen childhood !!! I haven't read the comic book version but I love the softened-up, touchy (Or whatever) Hit-Girl in this movie as much as that cheeky little girl in the first, and by that, you never get bored seeing Chloe/Hit-Girl on screen. (Spoiler ends)It got plot holes, weak lines and need-improvement acting, but you don't come to see a movie like Kick-Ass with a ""masterpiece-would-be-expectation"". It was BRILLIANT as a sequel. Kick-Ass 2 handled the emotional factor a lot better than its predecessor, and that was a high-five for me. It might not be the type of *Kick-Ass* you like, with lots of violence, sh**, guts and bloody tragedies in every scenes. But don't forget, Kick-Ass was also a story took place in an overdo reality, but still reality, and Kick-Ass 2 was the closer thing to real life than the first one. Now, I can say I'm totally into the characters and will definitely buy a copy of this movie. Can't wait for the 3rd one to come out.",Kick-Ass 2
388,surjus10,Balls to the walls,8,4 November 2013,"When I watched Kick Ass (first one), I got amazed. I was expecting a good film, but nothing like that! Sincerely, I think it is the best super-hero film ever. Kick Ass 2 is the sequel to Kick Ass. After finishing the mafia leader Frank D'Amico, Kick Ass and Hit Girl are living their lives normally, as super heroes, but D'Amico's son, Chris (who is Kick Ass' ex-partner) is planning to put them down, with a terrible plan...The film is great. Awesome action scenes, funny jokes, and well-done dramatic moments. The acting is also really good, including Jim Carrey's, who has done a great job as Colonel Stars and Stripes. One of the things I most liked about this film was the ""climax"" between Dave and Chris (The Motherf*cker!), showing a good and well-constructed rivalry, between hero and villain. Mother-Russia was also one of the high points in the film. She rocks, and the most exciting action scenes are with her. The final battle between heroes and villains was amazing. Unfortnately, it wasn't as good as it was in the comic book. In the comic book, it happened in the Time's Square (AWESOME), and in the film, it was in The Motherf*cker's quarter.This film is great.

Well, huge mistake. First thing that catches your eye is the head actresses pout. It is everywhere, all over the place, she's always having that fake innocent look in her eyes and the pout. I'm unsure if it is her natural mimics or she's thinking it is a genius idea for the role. The rest of the actors are OK but Chloe Moretz made it feel like the whole cast was horrible. I liked Jim Carrey, his acting was solid, and the ""bad guys"" were fine to watch too. The plot is your usual superhero thing, nothing special, it always is pretty bad, except the Batman movies. Dialogues in Kick Ass 2 made me feel embarrassed for just being there, inspirational wannabe conversations among kids are just a joke.

There was no real character development of the newbie heroes, so I couldn't have cared less if they lived or died. The middle part of the film detailing Hit Girl's attempts at being a normal teenager just felt weird, as if it was trying to capitalise on the whole ""fish out of water teenager girl"" story.The fight scenes were okay and there was some humour during the film.

When I get angry is when I can not reply to the comment or reviews; especially when you get some ludicrous rating of 1 and moronic review.

I did think there were some other draw backs to this sequel but they could have been completely disregarded if they could have just let hit girl be hit girl or at least just made her a small part of the movie because I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I do think it is worth watching just don't go into this movie expecting too much out of it.",Kick-Ass 2
