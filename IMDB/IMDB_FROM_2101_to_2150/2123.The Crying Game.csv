0,Leofwine_draca,Engrossing love story,6,3 March 2020,"THE CRYING GAME is one of director Neil Jordan's most engrossing and involving movies, made with depth and mature skill throughout. It's a small scale and simple story in which an IRA member, played in a hugely sympathetic way by Stephen Rea in his best role, gradually befriends a captured British soldier, as played by Forest Whitaker (who understandably struggles with his accent). After a lengthy introduction the story shifts to London, where Rea becomes infatuated with a mysterious hairdresser, as played by Jaye Davidson. It's a film I came to already knowing the plot twist - how could I not? It's one of the most famous of the 1990s - but this didn't stop the film being engaging. I found the romantic aspect handled in a particularly sensitive way, with Davidson thoroughly deserving his Oscar nomination in a difficult role. Ralph Brown and Tony Slattery are also welcome in smaller roles.",The Crying Game
1,SnoopyStyle,Such a shocking reveal,8,2 September 2014,"Jody (Forest Whitaker) is a British soldier lured and kidnapped by Jude (Miranda Richardson) and her IRA group with Fergus (Stephen Rea). Jody befriends Fergus and Jody tells him about his girlfriend Dil (Jaye Davidson). Jody runs away as Fergus follows reluctant to shoot him. By coincidence, the British army arrive to gun down the IRA group and accidentally runs over Jody. Fergus escapes and seeks out Dil, the London hairdresser.Writer/director Neil Jordan does something special here. There is a slightly homosexual tone between Jody and Fergus' interaction. It doesn't let on but it's constantly there. Of course it's about the shocking reveal. It certainly shocked me when I first saw it. At first glance, it could be seen as a simple gimmick. However watching it more than once, the whole movie is infused with that theme. The twist isn't something out of the blue and yet it's completely unexpected.",The Crying Game
2,Hitchcoc,"With or Without the ""Twist"" It's an Amazing Film",10,5 January 2017,"There are so many elements to this incredible film that I could go through, but they have been pointed out over and over. Suffice it to say that it has an intense, dangerous element, with forces at work that are utterly overwhelming. It has a couple love stories that transcend the ordinary (not just romantic love but that which holds us up as human). We have characters that are so complex and who reveal themselves to us in ways we seldom see. The plot is complex and engaging. It could be divided into fourths, with each part a single plot line which then comes back to center. There are no cheap, superfluous elements here. At the time, it was controversial and there was talk that it was simply pushing shock value. Put the commentary aside and be ready for the ride.",The Crying Game
3,Prismark10,Prick up your ears,6,12 May 2018,"Looking back at The Crying Game after a quarter of a century from its cinema release, it still is an intriguing film. It also looks increasingly quaint because within two years of its release there was a rapprochement between the IRA and the British government that would eventually lead to the peace process.Jody (Forest Whitaker) is a British soldier in Northern Ireland who is befriended by Jude (Miranda Richardson) who is an IRA agent. She plans to lure him into a honey trap where he is kidnapped.Jody angry and shocked befriends Fergus (Stephen Rea) one of his kidnappers. They tell stories to each other, Jody talks of his passion for cricket and his girlfriend Dil (Jaye Davidson.) Jody asks Fergus to look up Dil after he is dead.When the times comes Fergus reluctantly takes up the task to shoot him but Jody runs away into the woods and is run over by an army van that was on its way to rescue him and engages in battle with some of the kidnappers.Fergus escapes and arrives to London, gets a job in a building site and finds Dil who works as an hairdresser and performs at a nearby pub. They initially communicate via Col the barman (Jim Broadbent.)Dil is being harassed by a bully called Dave and it is not long before Fergus's IRA comrades arrive. They are angry at him for escaping in the aftermath of the botched hit on Jody. Yet Fergus and Dil still manage to fall in love through all the obstacles that arise.The film has an opening of a kidnap thriller with angry performances from Miranda Richardson and Adrian Dunbar as the IRA operatives. It then deviates to another kind of story, one involving a blossoming romance between essentially two outsiders, damaged in their own ways. Dil grieving over her boyfriend who has been killed but not knowing of Fergus's involvement in it.There are now two Oscar winners in this film. Forest Whitaker's cockney accent makes Dick van Dyke's turn in Mary Poppins into a masterclass of accents. The more subtle performance is from Jim Broadbent as the knowing barman.There is a precocious, vulnerable performance from Jaye Davidson whose hands betray a secret which Fergus failed to pick up on. The film has characters that lacked depth and a third act which was clunky and disappointing as Fergus is lured to another job by his so called IRA friends.",The Crying Game
4,classicsoncall,"""I kinda liked you as a girl.""",7,21 June 2019,"I watched the movie yesterday and THAT image is still in my brain. I can't say I was shocked, because it takes a lot to shock these days, but it sure wasn't expected. By that time, the story had already transitioned from being about IRA terrorists to a conflicted romantic entanglement that brought into question the sexual identities of all the principals, and I'm including in that statement the characters of Jody (Forest Whitaker) and Dave (Ralph Brown). They already had relationships going with Dil (Jaye Davidson), so they had to be in the know about his/her anatomy. After the big reveal, you could tell that Fergus/Jimmy (Stephen Rea) had all kinds of questions regarding his association with Dil, and it's a testament to the participating actors that they could pull off this mystifying story. The terrorism angle is picked up again later in the film with the assassination attempt that goes awry, and I couldn't help thinking that Miranda Richardson might have been channeling Uma Thurman's character from ""Pulp Fiction"", but in checking the release date of that picture coming a couple years after this one, maybe it was Thurman channeling Miranda Richardson from this one. All very disorienting.Anyway, I was intrigued enough to check out Jaye Davidson's bio page here on IMDb just to satisfy my curiosity, and I imagine you will too now that I mention it. Quite honestly, I didn't know what to expect but it's not as weird as it could have been I guess. I'd have to agree with the Fergus/Jimmy assessment from my summary line above as it relates to Dil - I kinda liked her as a girl too.",The Crying Game
5,gavin6942,Forest Whittaker's Accent??,7,28 April 2016,"A British soldier is kidnapped by IRA terrorists. He befriends one of his captors, who is drawn into the soldier's world.The then-fledgling film company Miramax decided to promote the film in the United States where it became a sleeper hit, earning over $60 million at the box office. A memorable advertising campaign generated intense public curiosity by asking audiences not to reveal the film's ""secret"" to their friends. Jordan also believed the film's success was a result of the film's British/Irish political issues being either lesser-known or completely unknown to American audiences, who thus flocked to the film for what Jordan called ""the sexual politics."" Alright, so I knew the ""secret"" for years before seeing this film. In fact, that is all I knew and thought it would come later in the picture. I was pleasantly surprised that this film has so much more -- history, political intrigue, thrills, and some crime elements. I have no idea what is up with Whittaker's voice -- he sounds dubbed.",The Crying Game
6,lee_eisenberg,"Cry for me, Ireland.",7,29 June 2006,"It's hard to tell whether they're portraying the IRA negatively or positively, but once the twist comes, you're sure to have your mind blown. The plot of course concerns an IRA agent (Stephen Rea) getting involved with the hubby (Jaye Davidson) of an English soldier (Forest Whitaker) whom he kidnapped. When I first heard what the plot was - including the twist - I actually assumed that ""The Crying Game"" was a comedy, sort of a modern-day ""Some Like It Hot"". But trust me, what this movie portrays is no laughing matter at all.Anyway, it's not like anything that you've ever seen before. And it certainly affirms Neil Jordan as a unique director. Also starring Miranda Richardson and Jim Broadbent.",The Crying Game
7,jboothmillard,The Crying Game,8,12 July 2005,"A very interesting and obviously controversial British drama from Oscar and BAFTA nominated director Neil Jordan. Basically British soldier Jody (Forest Whitaker) is kidnapped and held captive by the IRA, and an unlikely (brief) friendship develops with Fergus (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Stephen Rea). When the hostage-holding goes wrong and Jody is hit by a car when escaping, Fergus, feeling responsible, decides to go and see the woman Jody's lover. He eventually finds her, a hairdresser named Dil (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Jaye Davidson). He calls himself Jimmy and gets a job as a day labourer, and eventually starts seeing Dil, who has no idea of his IRA background. But the pivotal moment of the film is when Fergus eventually undresses Dil, and he didn't realise, she is a he! (The Crying Game definition: To find out your girlfriend who you've had intercourse with used to be a man, or, To get a woman to undress herself only for her to reveal a penis). He does promise to stay with Dil, as long as she/he (whatever you prefer) starts to dress as the gender he was born to be. Meanwhile, IRA member Jude (BAFTA nominated Miranda Richardson) who helped in the kidnapping of Jody has come back looking for Fergus, probably to kill him. Also starring Jim Broadbent as Col. I have to admit the first time I saw the film I thought Dil was played by a girl, and they had trick photography, I didn't realise it was guy! Featuring three or four versions of the song ""The Crying Game"", my favourite version is by Boy George. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing and Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, and it was nominated for Best Film and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Miranda Richardson was number 15 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and the film was number 32 on The 50 Greatest British Film. Very good!",The Crying Game
8,ccthemovieman-1,What's to like??,2,11 May 2006,"I really tried to like this movie. The critics (before I knew better) raved about this film so much it got me pumped up to see it. Well, to say it was a letdown is putting it mildly. Then again, a lot of people like sick and sordid films. I learned the hard way how sick mainline film critics are since they just loved the idea of a key character in the film turning out to be a transsexual. Wow! Cool! (Okay, if you say so.)There are just too many uncomfortable, sordid and dark scenes in this movie, including a horrible first 15 minutes in which Forest Whitaker is a hysterical IRA hostage out in the middle of the woods. That beginning was anything but entertaining, at least to me.However, I don't know anyone who watched this movie and liked it - not one!",The Crying Game
9,moonspinner55,"Unusual, intriguing film...",6,27 November 2005,"Highly unusual drama concerning an English soldier (Forest Whitaker) who is kidnapped by an underground Irish Army, eventually befriending his captor (Stephen Rea), which leads to a complicated series of personal entanglements involving the soldier's lover (the mysterious Jaye Davidson). Exceptionally well-made picture from canny director Neil Jordan, who also penned the screenplay and won an Oscar. Too bad the third act is so convoluted, and the final scene so banal, that a slight dissatisfaction clouds the overall result. Nevertheless, a daring and provocative piece with excellent performances. **1/2 from ****",The Crying Game

11,Theo Robertson,If It Wasn't For That Twist It Would Have Been Totally Obscure,6,13 July 2013,"A British soldier called Jody is kidnapped by the IRA and held hostage . Given the task of guarding him Fergus listens to Jody discuss his life . Showing Fergus a photograph of his girlfriend Dil and Fergus starts a strange obsession for Dil In 1992 this came and went in the blink of an eye at the British box office . Hardly surprising because the British box office appetite for Brit movies was still three or four years away . A British film in those days was basically a TV play with slightly better production values and this one is little different . When it was released in the rest of the world it became the film to see especially in America . Cynical Brits who hadn't seen the film would sneer that showing the IRA is a good light might have everything to do with it but then critics and marketing started making reference to the film's twist so much that when the film started picking up nominations at the big awards ceremonies people would jokingly ask if Jaye Davidson would be Oscar nominated as best supporting actor or best supporting actress This of course lets the cat out of the bag for everyone who hadn't seen the film . THE CRYING GAME exists mainly to set up this plot twist . If it was a conventional love story it would have headed straight to video and obscurity . Great suspension of disbelief is needed and the disbelief is a bit too difficult to suspend . Dil might look very feminine on celluloid but I can tell you in real life ladyboy wannabes are not so convincing . I remember one time in Pokhara in Nepal the town opened its gates to a ladyboy convention and I guarantee you not even Stevie Wonder would be fooled . There's a mannerism and a metaphysical aura to a transsexual impersonating a woman that fails to convince and knowing this you'd have severe doubts that Fergus would be taken in . The screenplay itself is very contrived with Jody having to become conveniently deaf which seals his fate and Fergus having to bump in to old friends That said I did find myself not exactly enjoying the film after first seeing it after a gap of nearly twenty years but respecting it more . This is certainly almost down to the hype surrounding the film on its release in America where the critics gave the impression this was the greatest film ever made . It's not but is a well acted well made drama . Forest Whittaker makes a mess of his accent which while rarely slipping in to American doesn't sound like a London accent . Stephen Rea manages to make his character likable even though he playing the long clichéd role of a "" good "" IRA man . Miranda Richardson who seemed to appear in every British film from the period does well enough enough to exorcise memories of her singularly awful performances as Queen Ezlibath in BLACKADDER 2 but the film quite rightly belongs to Jaye Davidson as Dil after appearing in this also gave an equally good performance in STARGATE then promptly disappeared as quickly arrived In summary THE CRYING GAME is a film that probably suffered from its own hype after becoming a sleeper hit in the States . It's never as deep as it tries try to be fusing issues of sexuality and identity . It's a love story with a difference but apart from the shock plot twist it's a film that would have appeared on channel 4 one Thursday night without causing a ripple",The Crying Game
12,LeonLouisRicci,One Story Two Many,7,6 February 2013,"This well known Film and its equally well known and at the time unexpected, explicit, and shocking scene, tries to be a dual Drama. It has a ""split personality"". It has both humanistic and political concerns. The double story combines uneasily and probably would have been better concentrating on the trans-looking and trans-spirited nature and the uncomfortable, but warm, relationship of the two very sensitive characters that are at the heart of this gallant effort.The opening scenes are the least affecting and the intertwining of both ""soldiers"" back-story commitment is uneasy, if not forced into the narrative. The best parts are some creative dialog and the ""lovers"" interplay. The result is a not so great film with an attraction of aspects that do move things along, but with uneven results. It is the compelling and quite different coupling that works the best and the other part seems to belong in another Film with another agenda. To geminate the two story lines appears to be the biggest failing and in the end it is very good by a half.",The Crying Game
13,evanston_dad,Is That a Flashlight in Your Pocket?....,8,6 January 2009,"""The Crying Game"" was quite a sensation back in 1992, and all anybody could talk about in connection with the movie was its big twist.I knew about the twist in advance of seeing the film, so I was able to concentrate on the rest of the story, and it's quite a good one. Neil Jordan crafted a slick little IRA thriller with a dusting of modern-day noir, and the film scores on both the levels of plot and character.Stephen Rea and Jaye Davidson received Oscar nominations for their performances (whatever happened to either of them?), while Forest Whitaker and Miranda Richardson (who had quite a prolific year in 1992) deliver solid turns as well.Grade: A-",The Crying Game
14,Mr-Fusion,File this under Movies That Draw You In,7,23 June 2017,"An IRA thug who falls for his prisoner's girlfriend. That's about as direct as it gets when it comes to summarizing ""The Crying Game"" (at least as far DVD cover blurbs go). But it's much more than that. Fate, deception, guilt, love - it's about all of those as well, but to discount it as centering on the twist is completely unfair. To me, the best thing about this movie is that it ended up being entirely different from how it began. And along the way, there are great performances (Stephen Rea and Jaye Davidson, in particular), striking cinematography and engaging direction to its credit.Note: If you've ever seen a certain Jim Carrey movie, then you know the twist I'm talking about. The reason I bring this up is because the movie stands on its own very well despite this spoiler, and remains absolutely worth seeing.7/10",The Crying Game

16,Smells_Like_Cheese,I knew how it ended and I was still shocked!,9,8 January 2007,"It's so funny because I know the exact plot of The Crying game, not just from I love the 90's, other viewers, or as this was named the number one most shocking movie of all time in Entertainment Weekly, I was thinking when I rented this movie how I wouldn't be shocked due to the fact that I knew what was going to happen, do you know what happened during the ""love"" scene? I actually gasped and laughed! Poor Stephen Rea, this movie was so great in the fact of how an Irishman's world could be totally turned over when the greatest circumstances come along.James has kidnapped along with his gang, a soldier, Jody. He and Jody become friends somewhat before tragically Jody is killed, but Jody asked him if he could see his true love, Dil, to let her know that she was the last thing he thought of. James meets Dil and falls in love with her to find out an interesting little ""Thing"" about her, she doesn't know yet that he knew her Jody and it could literally destroy each other once they find out each other's secrets.The Crying Game still to this day is one of the most shocking movies of all time and not to mention, just over all, a great film. The acting and story were just incredible and so unique. I really enjoyed The Crying Game, I think honestly anyone else can too, don't judge too harshly, look at the true art of the film and the story, it really is incredible. I miss the real shock movies, the one's that for some reason still contain the same emotions decades later, you know?9/10",The Crying Game
17,ElMaruecan82,"It takes great courage to be a good person, a great heart to look beyond the barriers...",9,27 January 2021,"Sex, race,, terrorism, gender identity... Long before these taboos became award-bait trends, The Crying Game"", dealt with them all without an ounce of preachy intent to become one of the most fascinating oddities British cinema ever provided: a poignant, moving and intelligent tale about people so entrapped by preconceived notions they believe to define them (a cause, an identity, even a gender) that they deliberately (or unconsciously?) refuse to see what heart and souls are hidden beneath a weapon, a uniform, or a naked body. The so-neglected human factor is the unsung hero of Neil Jordan's parable of human nature, tolerance and love.All the themes I've mentioned have been subjected to such a crucial and maligned attention that they became touchy and highly sensitive, jeopardizing one's career for a misfortunate tweet. However ""The Crying Game"", made ages ago, holds up very well, maybe more than today's films and I think its secret is in its sincerity: it can't be accused of surfing on trends for they were none at its time and so its intentions are as pure as the relationships it features; from the beautiful friendship to the puzzling romance whose emotional mechanisms prepares then leads us to something more intriguing that love which is its ability to transcend barriers we take for granted. Which is love at its purest, ultimately.But I make this review sound too abstract, let's get to the plot. ""The Crying Game"" starts with plain action: Jody, a British soldier played by Forest Whitaker, is kidnapped by IRA terrorists. Fergus (Stephen Rea) captured him right in the spot he was lured to by Jude (Miranda Richardson). She admits later that the seduction part ""was nice while it lasted"" but to use a euphemism, Jody wasn't his type (and she wasn't his type either). So even with twisted misconceptions, Judy is ready to compromise them for the cause she's serving. Fergus' nature is quite different as we discover later.Anyway, Jody is kept as a hostage until an IRA prisoner is released. Three days is an eternity for a semi-condemned to execution but enough to sympathize with your captor. And Jode's luck (within his misfortune) is that Fergus is a good man and the bond that will quickly grow out of some sweet exchanges is definitely not Stockholm Syndrome. Indeed, Jody despises politics and can see that Fergus is too good to sacrifice his decency for a so-called cause, and so he uses 'The Scorpion and the Frog' parable to make his point. And while he can't express his agreement, Fergus can't disagree : he too knows that if it wasn't for the 'cause', these two would have been best friends.Jode becomes an eye-opener and Withaker plays him with his usually quiet gentleness, the kind of buddy that makes you want to chill and just be yourself; and the ""intimate"" moment they share together (due to a biological emergency) is the build-up to a hilarious punchline that allows Jode to feel close enough to Fergus to ask him a favor. The flip-side of these tender moments is that the viewers figure out very soon that the story needs Jody to die so Fergus can honor his promise to meet his girlfriend Dil (Jaye Davidson).And it's all to the credit of Neil Jordan's Oscar-winning screenplay to surprise us even with that inevitability in our mind. Jode's death was imminent but the way it happens is both ironic and meaningful. Ironic because obviously Fergus didn't intend to kill him (which he technically didn't) but meaningful because his quest for Dil had to be be built on a little more than curiosity or posthumous friendship, there had to be some moral obligation for our protagonist and some connection to his friend's death anyway. Arc-wise, such a good man needed a redemption that required more than leaving the Organization and changing his identity.The film has a way to hop from a genre to another, politics take a break for a little while allowing to follow the strange romance growing between Fergus (as Jimmy) and Dil. Their interactions are witty, playful and full of innuendo... until something happens and that doesn't affect the enjoyment no matter if you know or don't. Just like knowing that the kid sees dead people in ""The Sixth Sense"", the greatness lies elsewhere. Still, I understand how ""The Cring Game"" couldn't have worked without a dose of secrecy and I too was fooled by the posters showing Miranda Richardson in femme-fatale look and Rea holding a gun, I bought the film as a neo-noir thriller but I'm glad it was sold that way to contradict my expectations... though I didn't know what to expect to be honest.What is remarkable though is the way situations unfold and leave us wondering how the characters react to it. I could tell that no matter what, Fergus wouldn't leave Dill maybe because he knows he owes her the truth. And in another masterstroke of irony (yes, the film is full of them), when the past resurfaces Fergus needs to take the right decisions to protect Jodie, and by acting so will not only strengthen their relationship but will confront it to an emotional knot quite similar than the one with Jody, but with one little twist that this time, it would be up to Dill to loose it or just... pull the trigger.Rea is absolutely phenomenal in a rather low-key performance, with his tired and let-it-go expression, he strikes as a man who's in far more confusion than any other character in the film. And through Dil, he'll learn to let his instinct drive him rather than his beliefs... and not commit the same mistake twice. Davidson is simply irresistible as Dill both before and after the little change he goes through out of love for Fergus. And even by his absence, Whitaker's ghost . shines all through the film as the soul reincarnated through the passion between Dil and Fergus.",The Crying Game
18,paul2001sw-1,"Clever narrative arc, clunky direction",6,11 November 2007,"Everybody who knows anything about Neil Jordan's film 'The Crying Game' knows about it's surprise ending. In fact, the twist comes well in advance of the end, but it's not the only surprising thing about this movie. Whereas some films lay out a premise and then never deviate from it, 'The Crying Game' moves repeatedly in unexpected (but not irrational) directions; if, at one quarter distance one attempted to guess what sort of film it would amount to, you'd probably call wrong; and again, at half-way, you'd make a different but still imperfect guess. It may be a thriller, but the overall narrative construction defies cliché.Unfortuantly, Jordan proves quite a clunky director. The movie seems low-key without feeling particularly intimate, lacking a certain intensity that the plot would appear to demand. And the performances were also moderate: Miranda Richardson over-acts, while Forrest Whittaker, unconvincing as an Englishman, becomes even less believable when we see him playing cricket. Jaye Davidson, who plays the character in greatest emotional turmoil, never varies the tone of her voice; while being ""cool"" is part of her act, to me the character felt increasingly lifeless as the story continued. Stephen Rea, admittedly, was good in the lead role, but his understated character needs more life around him, and he can't save the movie on his own. It's still worth watching, and even you think you know what's coming, the way it's revealed will still take you by surprise. But Jordan's earlier film 'Mona Lisa' had a bit more spark.",The Crying Game
19,Bored_Dragon,"""Definitely unusual""",7,18 April 2021,"Nominated in all major categories, this ""romantic"" crime drama won an Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. I watched the film mostly because of Forest Whitaker, but it turned out that his role, although important, is not particularly impressive. Nominee Stephen Rea did not leave a special impression either, but Jaye Davidson really deserved his nomination for a best supporting role, despite this being his film debut. Unfortunately, he had the misfortune to race for the Oscars with veterans, Pacino in ""The Scent of a Woman"" and Eastwood in ""Unforgiven."" Honestly, I was most impressed by Jim Broadbent, although he only appears in a few short scenes.The film is about a member of the IRA, whose unit kidnaps a soldier in order to exchange prisoners. While guarding the abducted soldier, he becomes close to him and after his death goes to find his love and convey the deceased's message to her. He finds her and, of course, romance follows. But the soldier's girlfriend is not what she pretends to be, so our hero and the audience are in for a shock.I believe that in 1992, the twist of this film might have been a surprise, breaking taboos and shocking the audience. But from today's perspective, when the things that this film shows have long since become part of everyday life, that factor of shock and surprise is lost, and what remains is a very nicely shot and acted, but totally obvious and predictable film. When the agony of boredom of the first forty minutes is added to that, my subjective impression does not reach even six. However, if I take into account the technical quality and the perspective of the time when it was created, I have to give it some slack.7/10.",The Crying Game

One of the terrorists befriends with the soldier and his life will change after some incidents that will occur.I liked this movie because it had a simple but nice and interesting plot that combined very well suspense with plot twists. The direction which was made by Neil Jordan, it was very good and I believe that he did an excellent job on it. He succeeded on making us understand the choices of his main characters, discovering their goals and follow their romance. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to say that both Stephen Rea who played as Fergus and Jaye Davidson who played as Dil were very good, and also Forest Whitaker who played as Jody, was equally good.

He felt compelled to meet her after the incident and was drawn into her world of perverted sexuality which revolved around a bizarre nightclub she worked in.

I myself have a strange history with this movie. I had a very strong idea about this film's ""big plot twist"" long before I actually sat down and watched it; a documentary on slasher movies also clued me in to the little detail that this film had hiding within its complex story structures. I have to say that upon having completely watched ""The Crying Game"" in its entirety, the ""big twist"" is still pretty shocking - even if it is to be expected. The film begins as an intense political thriller: IRA terrorist Fergus (Stephen Rea) is part of a plot to kidnap a black British soldier named Jody (Forest Whitaker, sporting his best British accent ever) in exchange for the freedom of several IRA members being held captive by the British military. The two strike up an unexpected, albeit tragic friendship: Jody knows that Fergus is no killer at heart, but instead extracts a promise from Fergus that in the event of his inevitable execution, he go to London to track down and protect his exotic lover Dil (Jaye Davidson). As expected, the two strike up a casual friendship that eventually blossoms into a tentative romantic relationship. And soon, even after the Big Twist, elements from Fergus's past as an IRA terrorist come back to haunt him. ""The Crying Game"" is a film that often explores the complexities of human nature (both the sordid histories of both Fergus and Dil come to the forefront for them both to deal with), against a backdrop of complex political intrigue, nationality, sexuality, race, and gender. These details, in addition to the subtle body language and nuances of the performers, make ""The Crying Game"" a complex and highly involving psychological thriller. It's a boldly acted, written, and directed little film with big-time ambitions. ""The Crying Game"" was undoubtedly one of the best films of 1992 and for plenty of good reason.10/10",The Crying Game
24,GiraffeDoor,Probably the best Wednesday movie ever,7,16 June 2019,"Calling a movie ""unique"" is not something I do lightly. It's not bizarre, avant garde or stylized but love it or hate it this movie will stay with you.OK elephant in the room: the twist. Was it really a twist? Did some people really not see it coming? I would never have considered it a twist if not for it being how everyone refers to the movie.Still a cool movie. At first it seems like a couple of arbitrary plot elements thrown together but thinking about it, it is a subtle and unpretentious examination of identity and the shallowness of who we think we are.Gentle but powerful in its handling, the acting is compelling, the direction is impeccable and the script is vivid.Not a movie that sits well in the stomach but you won't soon forget it.",The Crying Game

This very original drama deals with one man's dilemma as he must chose between his emotions and his allegiance to his country.Stephen Rea is very competent as I.R.A. activist 'Fergis', the man who faces the afore mentioned dilemma. In support of him are Forest Whitaker and Jaye Davidson, both brilliant in their respective roles as Jody and Dil.While the cast are great, it is the very funny, dramatic and occasionally moving script that really delivers great entertainment. Some audiences may be disturbed, but most will thoroughly enjoy the fantastic twist which will really floor you! Unreal!Sunday, May 2, 1993 - Knox District Centre",The Crying Game
26,rbverhoef,"Good, but may be too many twists",7,5 October 2004,"'The Crying Game' is an original movie in many ways. It seems to be about one thing, but suddenly turns ninety degrees and is about something completely different. It does not do this once but a couple of times, surprising us every single time. Here it works most of the time, but sometimes it feels the movie is there for the twists, not the story around those twists.The movie starts with a kidnapping by the IRA. Jody (Forest Whitaker) is the victim, the kidnappers include Jude (Miranda Richardson) and Fergus (Stephen Rea). Fergus is a friendly guy, only doing this for the IRA-cause. Jody talks with Fergus about a lot of things including his girl at home named Dil (Jaye Davidson). Fergus has to promise that he will talk to Dil if something happens to Jody.Things do happen to Jody, although not the way you might expect. Fergus keeps his promise but while doing that he is also running from the IRA, since things did not go as planned with Jody. He finds Dil and they fall in love. Fergus has hard times with that since Dil still does not know the truth about Jody.Around this point we are midway and we already have had a couple of twists, although some major ones still have to arrive. Up until here I really enjoyed this movie, but I realized the movie had no real focus. Personally I thought the movie was going to be about an IRA kidnapping, about some kind of friendship between a kidnapper and a hostage. It would have made an interesting movie. Now it is more original, changing it to a romantic story, sort of, with some sub-plots that really matter.Again, this would have been fine by me. But the movie has to change its subject again. Yes, I really was surprised by it but the movie lost some focus again. Especially this twist seemed to be there to shake up the audience. Fortunately the movie is good, with solid performances, so I wasn't really bothered by it, but the thought crossed my mind. For a lot of people the twists will make this movie better. For me it was a little distracting, but original and entertaining this movie definitely is.",The Crying Game

Besides Rea, Whitaker, and Miranda Richardson, I'd like to mention Jim Broadbent as a sympathetic bartender Col. For me, though, the absolutely stunning, one of the very best debuts in the movie history was Jaye Davidson who had no movie experience. You know, there are not many characters that I keep thinking about after the movie is over - where did they come from, how their life would turn after the final credits, how would this cruel world treat them, would they be happy? And I want them to be happy. Dil (Davidson) is one of them - what a marvelous creature, how vulnerable yet dignified she is, what a combination of dry remote coolness and quiet tenderness. No wonder, Fergus (Rea) (as Whitaker's Jody before him) fell under her spell even after he found out that nothing is what it seems. Great movie - makes you think, makes you feel, makes you talk about it, makes you want to see it again.9.5/10",The Crying Game
28,nycritic,The Story Within the Story,10,14 June 2006,"It's a rare feat when a story -- literal or visual -- can start out in one way, make you get involved in the initial theatrics that become the story's set-up, and suddenly, without warning, sweep the rug right off from under your feet and punch you dead in the stomach, leaving you with the wind knocked straight out of you. PSYCHO was one of those rare beasts that stand alone in its pedestal. The story of a woman who is in an illicit affair and wants out of her dead-end life, impulsively takes some money, and morphs into the songbird whose song gets cut in mid-tune as the story then turns into something completely black and sinister is the stuff of movie history. That you still cared for the perpetrator was amazing... but Hitchcock had a flawless story, one that needed only one major scare and one major twist to hook you in and then lead you into a nightmare.Neil Jordan must not have known the repercussions that his movie THE CRYING GAME would present -- and this was in a good way. He had thought on the title ""The Soldier's Wife"" for the film, but Kubrick advised him against it because it would spell it out too much and could hurt the movie's success. Because a lot of its success depended on if the audience would accept the plot twist that occurs roughly midway, thus a new title, one that would say as little as possible about the movie, had to be chosen. Thus how a British pop song which figures prominently within the movie and introduces the wild card was born. And because so much was made about the twist, was exactly the main reason that people flocked in droves to see it. I was living in Dominican Republic when this movie came out and I was one of the first ones to see it there... and I have to say I was floored.What this movie caused (in me, and everyone I knew, film critics and film buffs alike) was the feeling I expressed earlier: that of having the wind knocked right out of me. A movie that started out one way -- with the kidnapping of a British soldier played by Forrest Whittaker -- turning into something completely different, and not only because of the aforementioned twist but the gender reversals that takes place for two of the supporting characters. THE CRYING GAME is a lot more than what it seems to be from a superficial point of view; it's a game of political power that morphs into a game of sexual power and ends in an all-out battle of supremacy between the sexes. It's as if all of the elements that were introduced so carefully, like a house of cards, were blown away, leaving an afterimage that was there in subtle form.Stephen Rea's relationship to the three major players is crucial for anything to take place in THE CRYING GAME. From the get-go there is a hesitancy within his approach to the Miranda Richardson, who sports the masculine name Jude. She is all about action, pausing if at all to think later. She uses her own sexuality to bring down a man, and it catches up with her later in the most unusual way. But she also, we learn later, seems to want more from Rea's Fergus -- the terrorist blah-de-blah is only (to me) a setup for her more sexual machinations. A man trapped inside the body of a woman, she is really going after what she can't have, and Fergus is her complete opposite. Ergo, her complement. She may not know it, but something impels her not to leave him alone.Rea and Whittaker's friendship is a doomed affair, but one that allows him to jump a narrow chasm and embrace something even more exotic. It's not a problem that Whittaker's character already is above the action -- his active part in the story is essentially over the moment he becomes a prisoner; all he has left is to tell a story to whomever may listen. That Fergus does is like winning the lotto... but Fergus is a kind man and also beyond the terrestrial nature of the action. Now, that their interaction leads to Jaye Davidson who has a score to settle later on once the truth comes out of Whittaker's character's death is labyrinthine, but dependent on Rea's character's own evolution. Davidson, as the neutrally named Dil, is a woman who has her own story to tell as well, and a man's heart to open.A dazzling film, it's a staple of what to do with an intelligent script, and using a twist (or two) for the better of a story, and not revolving a story around a twist. It's thematically closer to VERTIGO in which a man falls into a complex love triangle and is unable to turn himself away from it, but goes one step farther by making that woman a true revelation.",The Crying Game
29,philip_vanderveken,"An unprecedented movie that might be very shocking, but that is also very good.",8,1 February 2005,"When first released in 1992, this movie created a shock wave and I sure can understand why. Even when seeing it today, this is still a rather unusual movie, even when you already know what will happen. It's unusual not only because it talks about the friendship between a kidnapped British soldier and an IRA terrorist who has to guard him, but also unusual for all the things that happen afterward. Of course I'm not going to tell you what you're about to see, but I'm pretty sure that you will be stunned, if not shocked.The director and the actors really did a very good job, because even though this movie may look like a complicated puzzle from time to time, at the end all the pieces fall into their place. And perhaps even more important: All the emotions in the movie feel very genuine. I never had the feeling that all that happened couldn't be true, even though it all was very remarkable.Despite the many twists, the rather slow pace of telling the story and the sometimes disturbing content, this is really a very interesting and original movie that should be seen by everybody. Personally I give it a 7.5/10, but I'm sure that many people will not like it because of some things that they will see.",The Crying Game
30,fntstcplnt,The Crying Game (1992),9,16 January 2020,"Directed by Neil Jordan. Starring Stephen Rea, Jaye Davidson, Miranda Richardson, Forest Whitaker, Jim Broadbent, Adrian Dunbar, Ralph Brown, Tony Slattery. (R)A group of IRA members, including volunteer Rea, kidnap a British soldier (Whitaker); later, Rea visits the soldier's girlfriend (Davidson) in London and becomes involved in a most unusual relationship with her. Stunning blend of thriller and romance explores daring subject matter in consistently fascinating ways, creating a story that is so full of surprises (many more than just the much ballyhooed ""twist"") that its very genre changes multiple times. Most serpentine suspensers are built purely on their own mechanism, but this one goes one step further by actually making the audience care about and identify with the original, layered characters. Davidson, an amateur ""discovered"" by a casting agent, gives a terrific debut performance, matched by a fine group of co-stars, some of whom have never been better. Director Jordan's Oscar-winning script, however, is the true star, and a very rare bird indeed for a movie that became famous for its shocking surprise: knowing the secret in advance doesn't spoil any of the pleasures of watching the plot unfold, and the writing never cheats or unnaturally deceives the audience for the sake of a cheap jolt at the moment the rug is pulled.91/100",The Crying Game

It has a fantastic script. Very real characters and a sharp wit gives it a great edge. It's quite small scale with two distinct halves, both a slow burn to big payoffs. Forget the context and content, this is how scripts should be written. Although Stephen Rea is great, I did find myself having problems with Forest Whitaker and Jaye Davidson in their awkward and forced line deliveries to the point where I thought there was something wrong with the sound. They may have taken me out of the moment sometimes during the long stretches of emotional brooding, but it's the film's thrilling moments that makes the film such a treat. 8/10",The Crying Game
32,valadas,The human soul is an abyss,6,10 February 2004,"Well the first thing that comes out on my mind is to ask whether feminine militants of IRA are such ""femmes fatales"" as the the character performed by Miranda Richardson which makes her a less convincing terrorist. Talking more seriously now, this movie is a soup which mixes a lot of ingredients that make it a bit awkward after all: IRA, terrorism, the kidnapping and execution of hostages, love-hate relationships, transsexuality and so on. To handle this odd and rather explosive mixture maybe a stronger hand than Mr. Neil Jordan's would be needed in my opinion. Because in spite of all those powerful ingredients the plot develops itself in a more or less apathetic rhythm if you exclude the final scenes. Stephen Rea is not very convincing either, in the role of a terrorist with a human heart and the first scenes where he's at once shown as that make us wonder why such a man has joined the IRA a movement made up, like all the other similar ones anywhere in the world, of people who never hesitate to kill unarmed civilians in cold blood as long as they think it necessary, without straining at a gnat with such delicacies as human life or good feelings or the simple fact that the killed ones have children, wives, husbands or other relatives who will mourn them. Well but that is quite another story. In purely film-making terms I still think that this melodramatic story would have required a more melodramatic talent to tell it to us in images and words because human soul is an abyss indeed like the Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa once said.",The Crying Game
33,Howlin Wolf,No tears please - it's a waste of good suffering...,5,3 September 2019,"I first attempted to watch this when I was around 15, or so... It was on Channel Four, in the early hours of the morning, and I had school the next day...Even at that age, I was smart enough not to be transphobic, but I still turned it off after the big 'reveal'. Despite my tired state, it still felt really out of context, and as though it had been placed there to shock, rather than to be explored properly, within the terms of the story...I always told myself that eventually I'd come back and rewatch it in full though, when I was less tired and hopefully more mature, to see if I still felt the same way. Well, last night was that night. Although I was still tired, I watched it all the way through this time... and unfortunately, the impression I got halfway through the film remains pretty much unaltered.It still feels like a stunt put there to exploit a transgender person's pain, in order to aid a cis guy's 'redemption' (remember that I felt this way when I was 15, and SJW's weren't a 'thing', then - so I don't think I'm being overly sensitive!). Dil is just a cipher, employed to reinforce stereotypical notions of masculinity.It also doesn't help that in the first half of the film, Forest Whitaker's performance is uncharacteristically awful. A more obvious example of miscasting, it would be hard to find - and it's incredibly jarring to the aura of grit and realism that the film otherwise works so hard to establish.",The Crying Game
34,Screen_Blitz,A gripping romantic tale with tests your expectations,9,30 April 2016,"Neil Jordan's The Crying Game is certainly no ordinary love story, it is far from it. This gripping drama boasts some of powerhouse performances by a surprising cast and awe- spectacular writing that fuels it into one of the most inspiring and captivating romance flick that greatly defies expectations from the opening moments to the shocking twist that defines the final act. This film stars Forest Whitaker as Jody, a British soldier who develops a romance with a cute blondie named Jude (played by Miranda Richardson) at a state fair, only to set up for a trap that results in him kidnapped by a group of Irish terrorists lead by Maguire (played by Adrian Dunbar). Taking him hostage, the terrorists hold him captive in their house deep in the woods while Ferguson (played by Stephen Rea), one of the members of the group forms an unexpected bond with Jody, much to the terrorist's dismay. When the hostage situation goes suddenly awry, Fergus flees to London where he finds Jody's lover Dil (played by Jaye Davidson). Adopting the name Jimmy, Fergus develops a relationship with Dil who he hides his affiliation with the Irish terrorist group from. When Fergus discovers Dil is not exactly who he believe she was, he finds himself in a potentially dangerous situation. As I mentioned, this is a type of film that requires viewers to take to their expectations and push them aside. And this does quite a diligent job at putting viewers' expectations to the test. From the opening scene, the film blesses viewers with a dark, but gripping story and it moves at a very steady pace. The pacing can be frustrating to some viewers who demand for a frenetic-driven story, but as it builds up to its shocking twist and the intense aftermath that follows it grows more and more cohesive to where the slow pacing succeeds to make sense. And much of this is thanks to Neil Jordan's enchanting screenplay. Perhaps the screenplay is not the only element that drives the film but also the performances by the cast. Forest Whitaker is quite engaging in what is arguably the best role he's demonstrated in his career. The bond between his character and Fergus played by Stephen Rea is strongly effective and enough to grip audiences' attention. Stephen Rea delivers a gripping performance as well, but the biggest appeal comes from Jaye Davidson who strives one of the most powerful (and criminally underrated) performances I have seen in a long time. Davidson nails the role with astounding conviction, and blesses the film with a performance that is too powerful to ignore. The Crying Game is a very powerful and unpredictable film that deserves the attention of many, and an intense thriller that delivers more than what moviegoers may bargain for. The screenplay, performances , and the overall direction by Neil Jordan earn solid praise, and make an awe inspiring film that stands above many films of its decade.",The Crying Game
35,seymourblack-1,Driven By Nature,9,10 August 2018,"It begins like a political thriller and develops into a romantic drama but what's most remarkable about ""The Crying Game"" is its incredible originality. It's essentially a piece about what it is to be human and the extent to which an individual's nature determines the directions that they take in life. The story that illustrates this is a real ""one-off"" and features a group of interesting characters whose awareness of their own nature and that of other people, varies considerably. The events depicted and the issues raised must've been challenging for many audiences at first and so it's rather surprising that in the years since the release of this film, that there haven't been more mainstream movies which have ventured into the same territory.During ""The Troubles"" in Northern Ireland, a British soldier called Jody (Forest Whitaker) befriends local girl Jude (Miranda Richardson) and after having some fun at a fairground, decides to move to somewhere a little quitter where they can be more intimate. As soon as they find a suitable spot, Jody finds himself being held at gunpoint and realises that he's been lured into a trap. He's taken hostage by an IRA cell whose members want to negotiate a prisoner exchange with the British Army and tell him that he'll be executed if their plan doesn't succeed within three days.In a remote country location, cell-member Fergus (Stephen Rea) is assigned to the task of guarding Jody and in the hours that follow, an unlikely friendship develops between them during which Jody shows Fergus a photograph of his girlfriend in London. The soldier, who's obviously convinced that his guard is a kind and decent man, says that if he's executed, he'd like Fergus to look up his girlfriend, buy her a maguerita and tell her that Jody was thinking of her. Fergus promises to do this and when it becomes evident that no prisoner exchange is going to be possible and Fergus will have to carry out the execution, what follows illustrates that Jody's judgement of what Fergus' nature will allow him to do, was completely accurate. Jody is, nevertheless, killed during the mayhem that follows when the Army suddenly raid the location where he'd been held hostage.
Fergus is fortunate to escape and makes his way to London where he assumes a new identity, gets a job working on building site and locates Jody's girlfriend, Dil (Jaye Davidson), who's a hairdresser in Millie's Hair Salon. After availing himself of Dil's services for ""a trim"", he goes to the Metro (a pub which Jody had told him that Dil frequents) where they strike up a conversation and subsequently become an item. They both withhold important information about themselves and inevitably some of the revelations that follow cause problems which are not made any easier to resolve when Jude suddenly arrives from Ireland and threatens that Dil will suffer unless Fergus agrees to take part in a planned assassination which Fergus immediately recognises is nothing short of a suicide mission""The Crying Game"" is skilfully written with each development following on very naturally from what preceded it. This is quite an achievement because some of the twists are extraordinary and shocking and the characters and their relationships are continuously full of surprises. The quality of the acting is exceptional throughout with Stephen Rea standing out as the naïve Fergus who initially has virtually no awareness of his own nature and then struggles to deal with the situations he finds himself in. Forest Whitaker is fascinating as the cricket-loving soldier from Tottenham because, whilst he clearly has considerable insight into the significance of an individual's nature, its never entirely clear in his exchanges with Fergus, whether there's an element of manipulation involved. Jaye Davidson is brilliantly cast as the mysterious Dil who, although appearing confident, is actually vulnerable and needy and Miranda Richardson is faultless as the ruthless terrorist, Jude.""The Crying Game"" is absolutely compelling to watch because it's so different, so affecting and such a human story. It's also very thought-provoking and the title song is ideal because its haunting quality fits the atmosphere of the piece so perfectly.",The Crying Game
36,mattymatt4ever,A beautiful film. Too bad it's now looked at as a joke.,9,28 January 2003,"****POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD*******I remember when ""The Crying Game"" came out it became a big sleeper hit and everyone was raving about it.  Then everyone got hold of the story's twist in which the main character discovers this alleged woman is a man, and it was parodied on several TV shows and a scene from ""Ace Ventura.""  OK, so some of the jokes were funny, but now all people think of when they look back to this movie is ""Hey, that's the movie where that guy finds out that chick is a man!""  It's actually much more multi-faceted, and I finally got the chance to watch the movie in its entirety in one of my media classes.
The characters are beautifully developed.  There are so many movies out there with thinly developed characters, but this movie is rich with character development.  And you get a sense of each of their motivations. Though the story is intriguing, the characters don't end up doing things that are strictly plot-driven.It's never established that Stephen Rea's character is a homosexual, nor does it need to, because I still believed in his love for Dil, whether he/she was a man or woman.  The film blurs the line between gender and race. Rea's character expresses his love for Dil in subtle ways.  Because of finding out about Dil's secret, he doesn't even want to make eye contact with him.  Yet whenever someone makes some sort of degrading statement towards him, he gets angry and resorts to violence.Rea's performance alone makes this worth watching.  It is one of the best performances I've ever seen!  He communicates every emotion so perfectly with his face.  I was constantly able to detect the conflicted feelings that were going on inside his head simply from his face.  It's so subtle, yet so effective.  Jaye Davidson also does a great job.  Oscar-winner Jim Broadbent has a small, amusing role as the bartender/mediator.  And Forrest Whitaker also gives a powerful performance in the first 20 minutes of the film.  A couple people criticized his British accent, but I didn't notice a single glitch.  Then again, I'm not British and I can't be the judge.  Whether the accent was good or bad, he still immersed himself fully into character and gave a tour-de-force like always.  Whitaker's an underrated, versatile actor and doesn't always receive the credit he deserves.The cinematography is excellent, concentrating a lot on Rea's reactions. The score perfectly intensifies every somber moment, and though it's fairly old by now I like Boy George's rendition of ""The Crying Game.""
If you haven't seen the movie, I highly recommend it, as long as you can view it maturely and not waiting for the ""scene"" to come up.

37,gftbiloxi,The Labyrinth Of The Human Heart,10,3 February 2008,"Few films have so consistently defeated expectations, both on and off the screen, as Neil Jordan's 1992 THE CRYING GAME, a dark and darkly humorous tale of terrorism, guilt, revenge, and the vagaries of the human heart. Producers disliked the script, which they considered both noncommercial and impossible to cast. Filmed on a shoestring budget, it was expected to go nowhere fast--and then became the most talked-about film of its year, alternately fascinating and outraging audiences and critics around the world, nominated for and winning numerous awards, and going on to become one of the top grossing films of its year.The film is extremely difficult to discuss because to do so undermines its power for a first-time viewer. In a general sense, it concerns IRA terrorist Fergus (Stephen Rea), who is involved in the kidnapping of English solider Jody (Forrest Whittaker.) Soon Fergus finds himself pursued by the English as well as the IRA, which feels he has betrayed them; he hides himself in the crowds of London, where he is attracted to Jody's girl--the elegant Dill (Jaye Davidson.) But the more Fergus tries to avoid danger, the more it swells around him, threatening to engulf both Dill and himself.I first saw THE CRYING GAME in its theatrical release and came to the film knowing absolutely nothing about it. It was a remarkable experience because each time I became convinced I knew what the film was about I was wrong: the story, the characters, the dialogue, the cinematography took an unexpected turn and proceeded down a completely unanticipated path. Although I was impressed, I wondered if the film would be as effective on a second or third viewing--but although the movie is filled with a host of twists, it is not superficial; it does indeed hold up to repeated viewings, for each time one sees it one becomes aware of additional nuances that one missed before.So what, ultimately, is THE CRYING GAME about? It is an extremely difficult film to define, but in the end I think it is about the nature of love. We cannot predict who we will love, who will love us, or what the outcome of that love will be--but even though we may struggle for it or against it, love drives us with a powerful force into situations and conclusions that we may not have anticipated in our wildest dreams. THE CRYING GAME is the labyrinth of the human heart in all its glories and follies and disconcerting effects.The collector's edition of the film comes with numerous bonuses ranging from an alternate ending to a documentary on Ireland's troubles to various ""making of"" features. All are worth watching; most interesting, however, is director-writer Neil Jordan's commentary, which covers many aspects of both the film and his career in general.

In lean times a film can live on these things alone. Crying Game is another example.(Shame it wasn't made in French I am sure it would have won the Best Foreign Film Oscar!) This film would have been quickly been dropped in to the bargain bin (if it got on to video/DVD at all) if it were not for a twist -- that while original -- is hardly worth waiting up for.When you start watching this you start to think -- yes, this is OK and very easy to follow. An examination of what is known as the Stockholm Syndrome (prisoner and captor getting too close) and is a kind of ""will he -- won't he"" (kill him) exercise.(A bit like a single intense episode of The Sopranos.) While this is generally OK it looks a lot like quality television and it does drag on more than it should. Even with quality acting and actors -- the thing develops at a snail's pace.(Special credit for Forest Whitaker for doing a wonderful English working class accent.) Then come the twist that people are praising as the biggest reversal of expectations since Psycho. For my part it was OK and makes the whole thing in to something different -- but it did nothing to disguise the waiting (rather than crying) game you have to sit through to get to it.On a general note, I am not a big fan of director Neil Jordan, but I admire the way that he tries his best to be different and try out new things.

I had heard about it back in the 1990s but never went to see it because it just sounded like sensational nonsense. In fact, it is well paced, well planned, well acted and well executed. The theme seems a bit less outrageous today than it must have in 1992, what with hordes of people transitioning and revolting against unwanted pronoun ascription and the like, but it does not seem dated in the least. In fact, it could have been made yesterday, for it seems fresh and original despite being nearly thirty years old. Glad that I finally got around to watching it.",The Crying Game
42,Movie-12,One of the most shocking and original movies of 1992. ***1/2 (out of four),9,29 May 2001,"THE CRYING GAME / (1992) ***1/2 (out of four)	 By Blake French:	I admire Neil Jordan for contributing his vastly original ideas to theater screens, as do I admire the Academy Awards, who appropriately rewarded ""The Crying Game"" with the best original screenplay Oscar in 1992. The film also earned nominations for best picture, director, leading and supporting actors, and editing. Jordan's style of filmmaking feels consistent over the years. ""The Crying Game"" offers the usual flavor of Jordan, but also incorporates unexpected, ninety degree twists that change the pace of his story altogether.	""The Crying Game"" begins in Northern Ireland, where the IRA takes prisoner a British soldier named Jody (Forest Whitaker). Among the team of committed terrorists is the quiet Fergus (Stephen Rea), and the seductive Jude (Miranda Richardson), who guard Jody in an isolated forest shelter. As Fergus continually watches Jody, the two become begin to like one another. Jody knows that his tragic fate nears, therefore, shows Fergus a photograph of his romantic interest, who lives back in London. He asks Fergus to look her up sometime if he ever gets the chance. 	The movie takes a ridged, unexpected turn, and the next time we see Fergus, he is living as a construction worker in London under a new name. He finds the soldier's girlfriend working at a beauty salon. Her name is Dil (Jaye Davidson). Fergus gets a haircut, and follows her to a nearby bar, then the next thing we know the two are deeply in love. But Dil has a secret-and so does Fergus. What would Dil think if she knew her new lover was responsible for her late boyfriend's death? 	Stephen Rae is the best thing in the movie, interlocking the several separate plots with a concrete narrative. The film takes his point of view, and does so consistently. This is essential, since we learn information as he does-a classic yet extraordinarily effective method of keeping an audience involved. Here, Jordan celebrates a clean story, but reveals information about certain characters that change the entire direction of the story, while keeping the important material in play. That is not easy.
	""The Crying Game"" is not for everyone-it's a hard, perverse movie with enough content to warrant several R ratings. The sexual content is unexpected and distorted, but stunningly original. Three minutes do not pass before a character casually utters the notorious four-letter word. Even the violence is aggressive and graphic. ""The Crying Game"" takes no prisoners, so hold on tight and come prepared for the ride. 	I think the film could have investigated the relationship between Dil and Jody with more detail. We learn how Jody feels about Dil, but Dil resists sharing her feelings about Jody. Is this done for a purpose? I think so. Neil Jordan is not the kind of director who would leave out massive plot nuggets like this, especially in a movie as deliberate and complex as ""The Crying Game."" However, Dil feels a little shallow in this area. With a little more emotion and dimension, she could have been even more intriguing. Jaye Davidson does a great job with the character, however, which probably explains why this element of the story has not received many other complaints.	""The Crying Game"" was certainly one of the most original movies to hit theaters in 1992, and deserved many of its award nominations and wins. Neil Jordan bravely takes us through controversial material, while at the same time, keeps us focused on the main points of the movie. He keeps the audience in his grasp the whole way through-something all directors should strive to accomplish.",The Crying Game

44,Eumenides_0,"A Great Story About Love, Tolerance and Sacrifice",10,7 April 2009,"The Crying Game is one of my favorite movies. Unlike most people I saw the movie knowing the twist. This perhaps allowed me to focus on other aspects, like the concise writing, the subtle performances, the camera work, the layers of themes. Over the years the popularity of this movie has dwindled as people have called it a gimmicky movie sustained on a twist. I think people must be insane not to see the beautiful love story, which is the real center of the movie. The twist only really matters for 30 minutes. The rest is all about characterization, feelings, ideas. Some movies, like The Sixth Sense and Memento, are all about the twist, they lead up to it and lose any interest afterwards. The Crying Game is a movie that could work well without it because it's all about the characters.Jody (wonderfully played by Forrest Whitaker), a British soldier in Ireland, is seduced by an IRA agent, Jude, and soon kidnapped by other agents, including the friendly Fergus (Stephen Rea in his best performance ever). A bond develops between hostage and keeper and as the execution day approaches, Jody makes Fergus promise to find his girl, Dil, and buy her a drink. Once Jody dies, the fugitive Fergus decides to honor this last wish and escapes to London.There he meets and falls in love with Dil. And what seems like a simple love story becomes a meditation about identity, gender, love, sacrifice and tolerance. Quite a lot for a gimmicky movie.Tolerance is the heart of the movie. Prejudice is explored in several forms along the movie, some obviously, like the IRA conflict which is all about religious prejudice, to Jody's being victim of racism, to Fergus as an Irish immigrant abused by his boss who loves the word 'Paddy', to the conversation about cricket being a poor man's sport in Antigua, Jody's birthplace, and a rich man's sport in England, down to the relationship between Fergus and Dil.The Crying Game is an endearing movie which deserves more attention and certainly must be appreciated for its intrinsic qualities and not for a cool twist Jordan came up with 17 years ago. I think so long as people enjoy a good story about love and friendship, this movie will never be forgotten.",The Crying Game
45,MichaelMargetis,"""I'm loud, darling, but never cheap. "" - Dil",7,19 November 2005,"In all honesty, I have to say I was extremely disappointed in 'The Crying Game'. People were telling it was such an amazing and surprising film, but I have to tell you I kind of knew she was a 'he'. I mean, who couldn't, - ADAM'S APPLE! I wasn't too surprised with that, but I was shocked when they revealed his/her/it's penis (WOW!), creepy stuff. But besides that 'The Crying Game' is overall a very good film. Neil Jordan does his finest direction to date with 'The Crying Game', and his screenplay is also powerful, but drags a lot especially during the middle. I think the best quality about this motion picture is the acting. Every actor is at the top of their game. Stephen Rea gives a carefully-crafted powerhouse performance (that is in my opinion his best) as Fergus, a member of a notorious anti-IRA activist group who with his co-workers including the crazy, violent vixen Jude (Miranda Richardson - in a swift and brilliant performance that should have earned her an Oscar nomination), kidnap an IRA Soldier, Jody (Forest Whitaker - in one of his best performances) to hold him for ransom. Fergus is in charge of guarding Jody and the two of them start a friendship. After all goes to sh*t, and half of Fergus' team and Jody dies, Fergus keeps a promise to Jody that he will seek out his girlfriend, Dil (Jaye Davidson - another incredible Oscar-nominated performance, the best he's given). Fergus falls in love with Dil, but doesn't know she's a he. When he finds out he decides to stay with her because he fell in love with her/him/it. But Fergus' violent past comes back to haunt him. 'The Crying Game' is a very good film, but it relied to much on it's twist, that in my opinion wasn't too much of a shocker. Still, even with that aside the quality of 'The Crying Game' is still up there. I would say if you see this one afternoon or night on HBO or one of the other movie channels I recommend you watch it if nothing else is on. 'The Crying Game' is a film about the acting which is no doubt exceptional. It's very gritty, and definitely not for the more weak-hearted (those who would hate to see two men kiss should avoid this), but I have to give credit where it is due and say 'The Crying Game' is not a great or excellent film like many will have you to believe, but again, it's a very good film with superior aspects all around, but the big ""twist"" isn't too convincing.

46,bregund,These days it's impossible to keep a twist secret,10,17 December 2018,"Picture the early 90s, the internet was largely a novelty and smart phones were science fiction, so the only way you might know if a film is any good or not is either by word of mouth of seeing a review in the newspaper or on television. Well, back then I kept hearing about this film and the twist that no one would talk about (""you have to see it"" everyone said). It made a big impact on me, not so much the gender-bending weirdness but the fact that the film somehow combined Irish terrorism with romance, skillfully weaving them together in ways that stand the test of time...I watched the film again tonight after so many years and enjoyed it just as much, the storyline is tight and the characters draw you in, as Jordan takes you down levels and levels into peoples' lives. I always wondered whatever happened to Jaye Davidson, he was perfectly cast in this film, his performance is much more than a novelty as he seems quite convincing in his role, and comfortable in front of the camera around seasoned actors. One charming device that I'm still struck by all these years later is how Dil uses the bartender (Jim Broadbent) as an indirect way of communicating with Fergus, it's original and not something I've seen in any other film.",The Crying Game
47,domino1003,Twisted Love,10,16 December 2005,"""The Crying Game"" still causes a stir after it was first released in 1992. The film offers an interesting take on a love story, with the usual case of betrayal, desire and violence. However, the film's interesting twist is what kept people watching the film back in 92, and still affects moviegoers today.Jody (Forest Whitaker)is a British soldier that is kidnapped at the start of the film, lured by the seductive charms of Jude (Miranda Richardson). A group of IRA terrorists kidnap him in order for the British to release one of their own. Fergus (Stephen Rea), one of the group members, befriends Jody. During one of their discussions, Jody shows a picture of his girl Dil (Jaye Davidson), who intrigues Fergus.Things soon go bad when the kidnapping turns incredibly ugly and Fergus flees to London. With a new identity and a job where the boss constantly chews him out, Fergus (Now known as Jimmy)seeks out Dil, whose a hairdresser. Drawn to Dil like a moth to a flame, Fergus finds out a bit more than he expected. And even then, he can't break his relationship with Dil.With the re-emergence of Jude (Now brunette and dressed to kill), Fergus is forced into a suicide mission, which draws Dil into the mix. This also leads into a nasty situation when Dil finds out the connection between ""Jimmy"" and Jude.Even though the ""secret"" has been let out of the bag many years ago, I'm not going to spoil it for the few remaining people that don't know it. But the film, directed and written by Neil Jordan (Who won an Oscar for writing it),still gives you an emotional story. You do feel a bit like Fergus: you really do care about what will happen.",The Crying Game
48,lagudafuad,I just couldn't get myself to like this movie,5,16 November 2012,"The Crying game has critical acclaim but I still found it hard to rate it above 5; to me it is something that is not for everybody.The acting delivered by the trio of Forest Whitaker, Stephen Rea and Jaye Davidson is the only thing this movie runs on, a triumphant entry into a world of perfect acting is what this movie delivers from the first scene. The movie's plot is also strong enough to keep you watching if you are that interested. The surprise that Fergus got when he found out that his new love is not exactly what he think she is, is the eye opener in the movie.Getting 6 Academy Award nominations and wining one for Best Original Screenplay, The Crying Game was released in 1992 to a favorable review holding a 100% approval rating from critics in Rotten Tomatoes. This psychological thriller drama was written and directed by filmmaker Neil Jordan (who is also a novelist on the side) who was behind the 1994 movie Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles and the 2007 movie The Brave One with Jodie Foster. Interview with the Vampire also had Stephen Rea as one of the cast with Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt.The movie went into production with the name The Soldier's Wife but the late Stanley Kubrick a good friend of Neil advised him against it, saying with a name like that people will expect a war film. The name of the movie is actually a song Dil (Jaye Davidson) sang at the club where she met Fergus (Stephen Rea). The Crying Game is a song by Boy George.The movies strong point is the plot, it thickens as the movie goes on; the plot has an IRA soldier named Fergus (Stephen Rea) and his unit, including a woman named Jude (Miranda Richardson) who was the bait to help kidnap Jody (Forest Whitaker).The IRA kidnapped Jody so as to use him as a bargain chip as they demand the release of other jailed IRA members, threatening to execute Jody if their demands are not met.While Fergus guards Jody, they develop a bond during which, Jody tells Fergus the story about the Scorpion and the Frog, which teaches the lesson that something's are natural to some people regardless of the circumstances in which they find themselves.Jody gets killed and Fergus has to keep a promise that he made to him to help take care of Dil.I won't want to rob you of the few thrills I got from the movie, but at least I can say it is not as grand as they all say, but I will let you be the judge of that.www.lagsreviews.com",The Crying Game

50,buckikris,"Believe Me, She's Everybody's Type.",9,24 May 2020,"The Crying Game came out in the early 1990's, and for the first time I had the opportunity to watch it a week ago. I heard so many positives about it I bought it for a great price. So here is my review on The Crying Game.The movie takes place in Northern Ireland in the beginning at a fair. Jody( Forrest Whitaker), who is a British solder gets involved with Jude( Miranda Richards). He is having the time of his life and little does he know she is a member of the I.R.A.. When the two go off to a secluded area for sex, Jody is kidnapped by Fergus( Steven Rea). The two take Jody to a secluded area where he is held prisoner, and for a ransom. If the English government doesn't meet the I.R.A. demands, Jody will be killed in so many days.While being held held Fergus develops a relationship with Jody. First it is just small talk then Jody starts to bring up his girlfriend, Dil( Jaye Davidson). He begins to show him pictures, and describing what she is like. Jody tells Fergus if he doesn't make it out, that Fergus will visit her in London. Fergus tells him to stop thinking like that, but he can't help it. One day Jody tries to escape from Fergus, only to be killed by an Irish Military truck. As the military moves in the I.R.A. hideout gets bombed. Fergus escapes and he vows he will visit Dil in London and tell her what happened.When he arrives in London, he takes up the name Jimmy, to fit in. He finds Dil working in a hair salon. When Dil's shift his over he meets up with her, and goes to the pub were she performs as a singer. The relationship begins to grow, and Dil believes Jimmy(Fergus) knows her secret. As things start to heat up, they decide to take it a step further and have sex. The two go to Dil's apartment and decide to have sex. This is where Jimmy( Fergus) discovers Dil is transgender. Jimmy is shocked, and Dil assumed he knew already.After this happens the two don't speak for days. Later after the brief spat they get back together. Even though Jimmy( Fergus) knows the truth about Dil, he is still attracted to her. Dil is a man anatomically but that doesn't matter to Jimmy. He still likes her/him but wants Dil to make some changes, he would like Dil to look more like a man. She refuses but lets Jimmy/Fergus cut her hair and wear some men's clothing. Jimmy/Fergus returns back to his hotel and finds his fellow I.R.A. member Jude already in his room. She and fellow I.R.A. member Maguire ( Adrian Dunbar) survived the bombing that, killed most of the other I.R.A. members. There she threatens Fergus he he doesn't complete the mission she will have him killed. The mission is to assassinate a judge.The night before the assassination Dil gets drunk and asks Jimmy/Fergus to come to Dil's apartment because she doesn't want to be left alone tonight. Dil knows what Jimmy/Fergus is planning to carry out the assassination and has plans of her own. Dil gets Jimmy to stay the night and while sleeping ties him to the bedpost. When he wakes the next morning he is held at gunpoint and saves Jimmy from carrying out the assassination. It still takes place, but Jimmy is not involved. He knows that Jude will now hunt him down and kill him for not getting involved.When Jude finds out Fergus/Jimmy failed his fellow I.R.A. members, she comes looking for him. She enter's Dil's apartment and gets shot several times, by Dil. Dil has Killed Her, but Jimmy/Fergus decides to help her out. He wipes her fingerprints off the gun and takes the rap for Jude's murder. A few month's later Dil visits Fergus in prison. They sit down and start talking, counting the days until Fergus/Jimmy's release.This is a great film I truly enjoyed. I thought Jaye Davidson did a remarkable job as Dil. If he didn't get an Oscar for his performance, somebody call 911 to report a robbery.",The Crying Game
51,dr_clarke_2,There's considerably more to The Crying Game than a big twist.,8,26 July 2020,"Neil Jordan's award winning The Crying Game is famous for its big twist halfway through. When the film was released in 1992, the twist was largely kept secret by reviewers and became the stuff of legend; it's now quite well-known of course, although its dramatic impact remains unaffected even if it is neither shocking nor surprising anymore. But there's considerably more to The Crying Game than a single twist.
Jordan both wrote and directed the film, and his screenplay is interesting in that it features as the main protagonist an IRA volunteer with whom the audience is expected to sympathise, and indeed does. That in itself was a bold move for a British film made in 1992, although the fact that said volunteer's two IRA colleagues are ruthless killers whose on-screen transgressions are ultimately rewarded with their deaths arguably balances this out. Nevertheless, Jordan's script is brave in tackling the subject. The story concerns Stephen Rea's Fergus, the aforementioned volunteer who becomes complicit in the kidnapping of a British soldier - Forest Whitaker's Jody - and ends up bonding with him, to the alarm of IRA members Maguire (Adrian Dunbar) and Jude (Miranda Richardson). Fergus finds that he is unable to execute Jody, who instead dies ironically when he accidentally runs beneath the wheels of a British Army vehicle, prompting Fergus to head to London in search of Jody's girlfriend Dil. Jordan tries to avoid writing his characters as good or evil, with Fergus spending the whole film questioning himself and changing as a result, and Jody frankly telling Fergus that he joined the British Army not to fight the Irish, but because he simply needed a job.
It would be inaccurate to say that The Crying Game is a serious study of the Troubles, which are essentially just used as background, but that in itself makes the film stand out. Once Fergus moves to London however, it becomes about something else entirely, as he falls in love with Jaye Davidson's Dil and is horrified to discover that she has an entirely unexpected penis. Despite Fergus initially reacting by striking Dil before vomiting, he ultimately realises that he still loves her, allowing the film to continue its trajectory as a love story; things go awry however when Maguire and Jude track Fergus down and forcibly recruit him for an IRA operation. Some modern reviewers tend to describe Dil as ""trans"", interpreting the character as a transgender woman, although Jordan intended Dil to be a transvestite, thus forcing Fergus to deal with the fact that he is in love with a man. Either way, the fact that he ultimately accepts Dil was quite progressive for 1992. More importantly in plot terms, it explores the theme of identity; not Dil's, but rather Fergus's, as he turns his back on his both his IRA past and his previous convictions about his sexuality.
A large part of the film's success lies in the performances, especially those of Stephen Rea and Jaye Davidson, who establish a convincing on-screen chemistry (made all the more impressive by the fact that Davidson had never acted before but still gives an utterly convincing, electrifying performance). But Jordan gets great performances out of all the cast members, with Richardson and Dunbar giving naturalistic performances in their roles, and Jim Broadbent getting a lovely supporting role as sage bartender Col. Whitaker's English accent is variable, but his heartfelt performance is crucial to the first half of the film, even if he is a bit fat for a squaddie. The characterisation generally works well, and there's an undercurrent of black humour running through the film, with some witty dialogue especially during the scene at the building site when Dil comes to see Fergus after she gets his apology note. Despite the film concluding with Fergus in prison, it ends on an optimistic note, with Dil visiting and waiting for him to be released.
The film's polished visuals are typical of Jordan, who favours dynamic camerawork, with frequent use of tracking shots. The film is shot largely on location, which gives it an added air of realism. In a particularly nice touch, after Fergus finds out the truth about Dil and returns to bar, the camera lingers on the other patrons, reflecting his realisation of what he - and probably most of the audience - missed before. There's a great partly diagetic soundtrack too. The Crying Game made a splash in 1992 because of the shock revelation that Dil had a penis; it's reputation has endured because it doesn't just rely on a twist, but because it is a well directed film with a well written screenplay.",The Crying Game

That is only the beginning. One of the IRA members finds himself later entering into the soldier's world.The twist is that the world is not quite what you are led to expect. This twist made this low budget film a huge commercial success internationally.The problem with ""twist"" films is that if you don't get to see them early enough you will be told the twist at some time. I have had the experience of seeing both ""the crying game"" and ""The 6th sense"" knowing the twist.With both these movies the story itself is compelling enough. Also in the crying game, the twist is not at the end but near the middle and forms part of the overall character development.Still an interesting movie though it simplifies the IRA into a bunch of thugs (some of them are, it is true) and reduces everyone to our nature, instead of saying we act out of circumstance.",The Crying Game

55,eshwarmail,A slow building multi-layered original drama with beautiful moments and unexpected twists,8,27 May 2016,"While it is famously known for its unexpected twist (though something doesn't feel right all along, one wouldn't expect it happen and with such graphic display), there are a lot more interesting elements to keep the audience invested throughout its runtime. It is very difficult to categorize the story into a specific genre as it touches different themes like conflicts between loyalty and affinity, sexuality, loneliness and monophobia with great ease and finesse. Another big positive is its masterful screenplay which binds many different story lines without rushing or underdeveloping any aspect and at the same time expertly placing beautiful moments at strategic places.Jody (Forest Whitaker), a British soldier gets seduced into a trap laid by IRS and becomes a hostage where he befriends one of his captors Fergus (Stephen Rea) who mutually responds to the affinity. A day comes when Fergus has to execute Jody but couldn't because of their bonding and Jody makes a run for it realizing that but gets crushed by an incoming tank of the British army who eventually annihilate the IRS camp. Assuming everyone to be dead, Fergus moves to Britain and starts living an anonymous life while looking for Dil (Jaye Davidson), who Jody mentions to be very special and requests Fergus to meet her. Fergus has to cope up with Dil's secret and his past catching up to him.Performances: Forest Whitaker starts off the proceedings well with a charismatic role with a small screen time that needs to be remembered throughout the movie. The mantle is carried forward excellently by Stephen Rea but the eventual showstopper is a career defining performance by Jaye Davidson as Dil with varying character arcs who is confident yet vulnerable and longing yet stubborn. Also a special mention goes to the bartender who plays an entertaining role. The rest of the actors does a decent job, they may not have layered characterizations but they settle into their roles well.Filmmaking: From the outset it looks like a slow building drama while the brilliance lies in its writing which brings various themes, story arcs and characters with such smoothness that it takes time to realize that the course of the story has changed from time to time. The director knows his winning moments as he invests enough of his runtime for such scenes which actually lingers on audience minds long after watching the movie. Almost always a conventional successful story is one which makes the audience to look forward to know how it concludes - 'Crying Game' is no different but with its unconventional theme and background it also adds an element of mystery and suspense making it even better. The background score does a great job by staying in the background, it is neither intrusive nor out of key and blends well with the proceedings on the screen.A slow building multi-layered original drama with beautiful moments and unexpected twists",The Crying Game

For years, I'd heard that this film holds this amazing plot twist, that will keep you astonished for months to come. What? If you don't know what this film is about, you're in for a real treat. Or, disappointment, depending on how you feel about the subject. Most people know already what the big surprise ending is, as I did, but if you don't I won't ruin anything for you. Just be prepared, that when you do find out what the twist is, it's pretty graphic and in your face.It's a film that I found distasteful, and really bad. It wasn't at all the type of film I thought it would be. I have to say I was overall quite disappointed with the film. It lacked quite a bit, and the first forty minutes of the movie, are unbelievably slow. Once you finally get to the point of the film, you're so numbed from the first almost hour, that it seems like the movie is hardly worth your time, by then.I will say though, that Jaye Davidson was outstanding in his role, and was quite believable. And, I'd like to add that I'm quite surprised that he hasn't done more, since then, acting wise.The film again, is quite slow, and not very well written. I felt the writers really strayed away from writing about the actual criminal activity that was going on, and focused more on the relationship between the two main characters. Which, frankly was pointless.I wouldn't waste my time with this one if I were you. It's not at all what everyone makes out to be, and although it is a cult classic, not all cult classics are worth watching, or as good as people tend to think they are. 'Rocky Horror Picture Show'.

57,jonathanruano,The Crying Game,10,10 April 2010,"In 1991-92, Irish director Neil Jordan filmed a masterpiece - it was called ""The Crying Game."" ""The Crying Game"" starts off as a tragic IRA story, but then evolves into something else and, before the 112 minutes are over, the plot changes again. Unlike the typical Hollywood film where you can predict how a story line will develop, it is impossible to figure out what is going to happen next in ""The Crying Game"" - and that is one of the great things about this movie. The other brilliant thing about this film are the characters, especially Fergus (Stephen Rea) and Dil (Jaye Davidson), who evolve and develop over the course of this film. Neil Jordan could have made a film with static characters like James Cameron did with ""True Lies"" or Stephen Spielberg did with ""The Indiana Jones"" series. But Jordan chose not do that. Instead he wanted to make a movie about people faced with difficult and quite unexpected personal crises and show how they evolve, or fail to evolve, to cope with these challenges. I have not ventured too deeply into the plot, because ""The Crying Game"" is not the kind of film that can be properly explained in a review. The Crying Game has to be seen more than once for it to be properly understood and the understanding of this film cannot be conveyed in a review, but rather can only result from a person experiencing it for himself or herself.

As well as Roger Ebert said about this title: ""See this film. Then shut up about it"" . Of that it is ""The Crying Game"", a history on the human nature. If we keep in mind the above-mentioned, then it would be breaking a ""rule"", because he/she should not talk about it. ""The Crying Game"" talks about a man that belongs to the IRA group and he kidnaps a British soldier. Next to other partners they contain it. Fergus, the man of which speak, creates a friendly relationship with the one kidnapped. Beginning a ""game"" at the same time in which will be discovered secrets, deaths will be given this way and of course, there will be tears. The movie, approaching topics like the terrorism until the acceptance. Is more than all that Fergus lives, as it plays that game that the life imposed him. Because after all, that it is the game of the life. In the case of Fergus, a merciless game of blood and tears, and this way to discover his nature, and to discover the nature of the others.There is another point that to touch and it is that of the appearance of the characters, being more specific, in a character. Jude is that type of Femme Fatale ""friend"" of Fergus. Then me chord of ""Pulp Fiction"" of Quentin Tarantino, and sight in my mind to Uma Thurman smoking a cigarette in their mat with a gun and some comics. Making a parallel one with the two characters, the identity of Jude is discovered as the catching woman that Neil Jordan creates and then Quentin Tarantino adapts. And we see how the beautiful Miranda Richardson represents that character.*Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any",The Crying Game
60,son_of_cheese_messiah,Could have been great but copped out,6,26 April 2011,"Considering the monumental reputation this film had, it is surprisingly average, a very slow moving plot and with rather clunky and, at times, amateurish direction.Even with its faults, this could have been a serious film, perhaps a masterpiece, if it had taken the easy route on several occasions. The earliest and most important of these cop outs is the shooting of Jody (Forest Whitaker). After its long (perhaps over long) opening sequence in which Jody is abducted, we feel we are at the start of a movie about moral choices and how, in this case the hero, Fergus, may have to do something he finds morally repugnant for the greater good. Alas, in a scene which completely deflated me, this choice is removed from him, Whittaker instead being run over by a British armoured car. Leaving aside the practical aspect (armoured cars are noisy things, not likely to creep up on you unnoticed), this completely destroys the powerful underlying tension of the film. Had Fergus shot Jody (or at least thought he had), then following his last request, had sought out the girl only to fall in love with her, the film would have asked serious questions about the nature of good and evil. Instead the hero becomes basically an errand boy.I do wonder if this strange decision was caused by a need to placate the American audience and thus sanitise the IRA to a degree? Certainly some of the next scenes in London seem to represent a cosy tourist view of the city with chirpy barman Jim Broadbent happily giving out cocktails to customers on their second visit (never known a barman to do that) and a clichéd white chav version of Essex man complete with shell suit. This stands out since the film is so careful (rightly) not to create stereotype Irish, black or LGBT characters. But this courtesy is not extended to white English males.The story meanders for a long time (with many rather pointless shots of a Jody bowling) both before and after the not so shocking reveal which I personally did not find that interesting. The story starts to flag just as Fergus's old IRA buddies show up. This lumbers to the final climax which again is rather amateurishly filmed.If you want to see a great and beautifully shot film about the IRA and love, ODD MAN OUT by Carol Reed is a far finer work.",The Crying Game
61,j-lacerra,She's My Type!,10,15 May 2007,"I knew nothing about this movie except that it was well regarded and starred Forest Whitaker. But I avoided renting it because of the title, which sounded sappy. But, once it was on I was enrapt with this tale of kidnapping and male bonding (of a nature). The scene in which captor Steven Rea allows bound prisoner Whitaker to urinate is hilarious. But it is really a dark movie, and quickly reverts to the gloomy premise that this captor will soon have to execute this prisoner.Of course, prisoner asks his new friend to call upon his girl after his death and let her know that his last thoughts were of her. At this point I'm starting to see a bit of Monster's Ball (a good thing). Somewhat deceptively predictably, Rea sees the girl, Dil, and falls for her. He is not sure how he will handle his secret, and then, BOOM!, we are let in upon HER secret! From here on in the movie is a love affair as well as a thriller. And a darn good example of both. For those reviewers here who said they saw everything coming, I say, Puleeeze! Spare me your smug and groundless boasts.Everyone in this picture was great: Whitaker convinces as a black British soldier (!), Rea underplays just right, Richardson is both sexy and menacing, all the bit players are perfect. But Jaye Davidson as Dil is just astounding. By the time this movie was two thirds through, I wanted Dil! This director is excellent. This film is better than excellent. It is a must-see; a clinic in acting, suspense, romance, sexuality, and even political violence on screen. See it.",The Crying Game
62,robsta23,"Uncomfortable, But a Solid Story",7,19 November 2015,"This film is somewhat strange in the sense that it feels like a political thriller for one portion of the film, but then throws you into a romantic story immediately after this (and aspects of the political thriller come back later). The first story is terrific in that it shows us an interesting bond between a soldier held hostage and the man who is assigned to watch him at gunpoint. It seems like a very tense story at first, but a good amount of humor emerges from the interactions between the two men to keep some of the tension at bay.I have to keep myself limited in my comments because what causes the ""first part"" to end and the ""second part"" to begin is a spoiler in itself. I don't feel at liberty to say much about the second part, but I will give it a try. The main points you need to know about the second part are that a romantic relationship develops and that a third party threatens the ""couple"" formed in this section of the film. Also, the midpoint of the film reveals a twist which made me uncomfortable for the rest of the film's duration, but did not necessarily cause it to be a bad film in my eyes.The film is well-executed and makes you think about important topics and issues which I will not get into here since it would spoil the movie. You simply need to watch the film in order to experience it; there are too many ways to spoil the movie if I get too in depth in my criticism. So I will leave you with the fact that the movie is well-executed, but the story is not the most enticing and I felt uncomfortable for a large portion of the movie. If you're willing to give a mysterious film which I'd say is a 7/10 a chance, go for it. If not, that's fine too.3.0/4.0",The Crying Game

The DVD we got did not have English subtitles, and with overly loud background noise and music, we found in near impossible to hear, let alone, understand what the actors were saying for what little we did try to watch. And we had read how good this movie is. And it looked it too, from what we have read and know of each actor. I wish whoever is redoing movies, or making movies, would make sure that audiences can understand most of what is being said (and seen) in a movie, and if not please add in English subtitles. That this is occurring more and more just shows that those in the business of making movies do not care about audiences. So another highly anticipated movie has been sent back. What a shame.",The Crying Game
64,dkncd,"""Who knows the secrets of the human heart?""",10,3 November 2007,"The challenge facing any reviewer of ""The Crying Game"" is to review it without revealing too much information about the film's ever-changing story. The best way to see this film is with as little information as possible going in. With that in mind, the film's story begins with an I.R.A. kidnapping of a British soldier and eventually focuses on one of the I.R.A. volunteer's journey to London to follow-up on a lead given to him.Stephen Rea gives a skilled performance as Fergus, the I.R.A. volunteer of principal interest. He manages to elicit sympathy and effectively convey the awkwardness of his position at all times. Forest Whitaker is likewise excellent as Jody, the British soldier who manages to remain touchingly high-spirited while suffering captivity. Miranda Richardson is memorable as the sassy and dangerous Jude. Jaye Davidson handles the demanding role of Dil very well.This film has a great story which is full of new developments and surprises that keep it interesting. There is one major plot twist in the story in particular which has become famous. Unfortunately I was able to deduce this twist based on information read prior to seeing the film, but it still proved very interesting and ultimately I wasn't hindered from enjoying the film. There are a number of discomforting moments in the story and an impressive amount of tension, which is built with the aid of the film's excellent score. ""The Crying Game"" remains engaging from start to finish due to superb performances and a well-developed story.",The Crying Game
65,quinimdb,The Crying Game,7,23 August 2016,"""The Crying Game"" was probably great in 1991, and the reviews reflect this, and it's still a pretty good movie today, but I can't help but feel that it's a bit dated. The film begins at a carnival with a man having sex with a woman, before suddenly a few other men holding guns come in and take the man away with a bag over his head. So it gets off suddenly and it's pretty intriguing, before one man (who we soon learn is actually our main character) explains the situation directly to us. We learn that Fergus and several other Irish Republican Army men (and the one woman that was having sex before) have taken Jody, a British soldier. Fergus and Jody bond when Fergus watches over him, much to the dismay of the other IRA members. These scenes are very well executed and the blocking in camera movements in them mirror the state of their relationship as it changes. Watch the scene in which Jody describes the frog and the scorpion story to Fergus. Fergus also learns that Jody has a woman at home whom he admires, and he plays cricket. Jody asks Fergus to take care of his woman when he dies. This close bonding leads to a rather tense scene in which Jody is supposed to be killed, and then isn't because of Fergus' good nature, and then is, by forces that were beyond his control. This lack of control is one of the main sources of fear for our main character, and it works for a little, but after Jody is killed, the movie gets a bit wonky in pacing and style.Fergus then moves to try and find the woman he promised to care for for Jody. He is driven by the cricket field that he works by. From here, the film gets rather predictable and unnecessarily slow for a little while. He meets Dil. He falls in love with Dil, and gets rid of her bad abusive boyfriend, who is the source of much of the strange and unfunny humor in this part of the film. She gives him a blow job, then he finds out that she's a man, which is a way more expected ""twist"" than it should be. There are many obvious nods about her sexuality up to this point. It should be subversive, but it's not. Fergus is very surprised, and slightly disturbed, but he comes back to her, because he ultimately does care for Dil despite her sexuality just as he cared for Jody despite being his hostage. Even if he causes himself and those around him to sink, his nature is being good. The film begins to start building at a good pace towards the last 10 minutes from here, and the last 10 minutes are great, tense, meaningful, and quite impressive in terms of editing and such, but so much of the middle of the film feels unnecessary and outdated, such as the music, humor, and the predictable ""twist"".",The Crying Game
66,RickHarvey,"Known for that one scene, Everything else has been forgotten",6,8 April 2011,"Known more for it's twist than anything, The crying game at best is a average drama . The film never went anywhere. First half was at least intriguing but after the Twist it began to feel cheap.With Forest's awful accent, it can take anyone many minutes to realise he English. The overall acting was fine and the conversations between the hostage and the capturer were engaging. All fairness , the first half of the film was enjoyable but after the twist it began to be daft. Thought i was watching another overblown story from the writers for Eastenders I find it hard why the crying game is ranked up there with the greatest British films of all time.

Every scene is repetitive in the second half and leads to a weird ending. I think film has a message which Neil Jordan couldn't really register. Actors were good, story was good and theme was good but it just stops moving after a point and falls flat on its nose in the end. The DVD's have an alternate ending in the special features which is actually what Neil wrote in the screenplay. The DVD ending of the film is what financiers pushed Neil Jordan for. I recommend if you liked this film then don't watch that ending because its pathetic. Also some of the reviewers felt that this film is irresponsible towards IRA. I think they shouldn't bother about that. The last thing anyone would remember of this film is IRA. Don't rent just wait you may get to see it on TV.",The Crying Game

He forms a surprising friendship with one of his kidnappers, Fergus (brilliant Stephen Rea) who has ""a killer smile"" but has also a heart. Jody adjures Fergus to go and find his loved one if something would happen to him...Neil Jordan has written an amazing script which makes you laugh and cry. The story is very well structured. It is a story of love as an universal thing. This is the philosophy that is very dear to me. Jordan masquerades brilliantly human reflections through well-written characters like Fergus and Dil (Jaye Davidson). Dil's character gets to say the best punch-lines in addition of Fergus. The metaphor of the scorpion and the frog reflects human nature greatly.The acting is fantastic. Stephen Rea is always very charming in his subtle way. Forest Whitaker was then just starting but his performance as Jody is touching. Jaye Davidson was a very good finding to play Dil. Miranda Richardson is ice-cold and cool as Jude.

I'm guessing this was quite a controversial and groundbreaking movie at the time.My only niggle was the cinematography and the location filming. The first part of the film could have been filmed anywhere, And the street scenes looked like they were stolen from Eastenders!

I probably knew about it since Ace Ventura was released because it satirizes the aftermath of the reveal.It holds up as a pretty good movie. Very good performance from Forest Whitaker doing what I thought to be quite a convincing British accent. Stephen Rea does a fine job as well as the protagonist. It's a shame that Jaye Davidson did not act much beyond this film because they are excellent in this role as Dil.I think this movie was a bit of a sleeper hit and these days doesn't really get talked about.

73,bedazzle,Guilt,8,26 May 2001,"Spoilers:Neil Jordan, while making this film had one question in mind, ""How far can guilt push a person?"" As Fergus demonstrates, plenty far.
1.) He moves to another territory - in fact the land of his sworn enemies - in order to fulfill the last wish of a dead man he had barely known.
2.) In fulfilling said wish, Fergus stalks Dil, beats a man, convinces himself that he is in love with her (really, he was simply trying to ""take care of her""), continues to protect her despite his marked repulsion concerning ""her"" transexualism, and eventually attempts to change her physical appearance and home to keep her safe (Though I think much of this change was reflective of an unconscious drive to bring Jody back to life, which is why Dil wore the same shirt Jody had always been dreamed of in by Fergus).    3.) Ultimately, Fergus ends up going to prison for a murder Dil committed.
Though it is easy to say that these events occured because of a newfound love which had evolved, that is not the point being made by Mr. Jordan. By continually reproaching Dil for calling him ""honey,"" Fergus makes it clear that he was not in love with her. He had merely been doing what he could to abate the tremendous guilt he had been feeling. More so, he did not choose to help her, it was his nature of extreme conscientousness that forced him into these extraordinary acts. It is precisely because this is not a love movie, that its statement is so profound.",The Crying Game
74,EyeDunno,Watch Again if you saw the Original Film Release,9,4 October 2016,"It's really a bit of an eye-opener to watch Crying Game in today's society if you can put yourself back to remember how things were in 1992. It feels like a completely different era of an even longer time removed since then. So much has changed, yet some things still remain constant. One of the most glaring reminders of the day: the murder of U.S. sailor Allen Schindler in 1992, and the military's alleged attempt for a cover-up afterward.My own perceptions and ideals have changed since I saw this at Baltimore's Charles Theatre. It's almost creepy to see how I've changed regarding certain... It's almost impossible to express without spoiling the film if I could ever say what I would like. Let me say however, that I wept with pain in my heart as I finally watched it again, just now. My empathy and personal awareness certainly has grown in 24 years since I saw the film's theatrical release. It's an amazing piece of cinematic achievement considering the time of its premiere. Really gutsy filmmaking, acting and direction for all involved. Seeing it again still makes my jaw drop because of all the nuances and story lines. It wasn't perfect looking at the film now. Some of it was a little dated, and perhaps I am being too picky regarding that. Yet it reawakens some troubled times that people faced in 1992, and how troubling things remain today.

80,paulmamak,A controversial film depicting British and Irish society in the early 90s.,6,23 September 2007,"I suggest to anyone wanting to see this film that they read what it is about before watching it.The film started off as outstanding, with Forrest Whitaker portraying a black Brit with an all most accurate British accent. His abduction by the IRA to me is the highlight of the film as you see the pain that he is having to go through in the overall circumstances. The electricity between Rea and Whitaker is incredible as you see Rea gradually showing remorse over the whole situation and how he has to battle his feelings for the sake of the IRA, being pressured by his allies. The climatic scene where is lead to be shot, only to escape and be hit by an army vehicle where the IRA members undergo attack by gunfire was amazing.The film then goes off on a tangent with Rea in scummy London, to fulfil a promise he made to Whitaker's character, of declaring the situation to the girl he left behind. Rea, trying to do so, starts to feel feelings for this girl as always in films. Leading to a build up of a romance between the two, until Rea finally finds out she is actually as he, ""the most shocking part of the film"". Rea, like anyone would, is disgusted over the circumstances, but continues to show feelings towards the he/she.From then on the film goes downhill with a complicated relationship forming between the two. Only to find that Rea's IRA companions have tracked him down and so he is drawn between the two situations.The film draws to a close by the IRA attacking a member of British government and Rea making his love clear to the he/she. Only for Rea to end up in prison after the he/she gunning down an IRA member.Overall I particularly enjoyed the beginning, but showed little interest in the controversial relationship.

As soon as Dil shows up I whisper in my wife's ear, ""That is one masculine looking chick"".  I was shocked but it takes more that a one second scene to make an entire movie.The film reminded me of 2001: A Space Odyssey (a great film).

It was shown on Film4's 'Films for Life' season in April 2011 so finally decided to watch it and was astounded by how bad it was. I'm bemused by all the comments here about the good script, good acting, etc because I experienced the exact opposite. The acting was appalling, especially Forest Whitaker and Jaye Davidson; Whitaker's English accent made Dick Van Dyke's Mary Poppins accent look good. It was all over the place, varying from Cockney to Australian to Texan American in one sentence. He was obviously concentrating on the accent as his acting was very hammy. Davidson was perhaps the most wooden and un-natural actor I've ever seen on screen - his happy, sad, drunk, murderous and suicidal were all delivered with the same emotionless deadpan monotone. The dialogue was stilted and full of cliché after cliché. The plot was unreal and relied on suspension of disbelief - apparently English people cannot distinguish between a thick Belfast accent and a Scottish one (wait a minute, that's Americans isn't it?); apparently the IRA plot the assassination of politicians off-the-cuff the day before in the back of a car with a 5 minute run-through and then, when it goes wrong, just wing it and deliberately instigate an OK Corral shoot-out....oh my, such a bad film",The Crying Game

Not a bad film, not a great film either, but it is the crazy twist that makes it memorable and that only survives (if you're lucky) the first viewing.  Stephen Rea makes the film human, mostly because his trademark 'lost mongrel' look works here for the first time since 'Angel.'  The rest of the cast overact (even Dunbar who can be very good) and poor old Forrest Whittaker struggles with the London accent so much that he ends up doing a world tour, taking in Sydney, Johannasburg and Macclesfield along the way.  Jaye Davidson is awesome, but it's one-time gig unfortunately.  I think for anyone who actually lives in Northern Ireland, the terrorists seemed pretty two-dimensional and the kidnap plot wasn't very believable let alone the army appearing in a rescue attempt.

I have recently viewed in on tape not having seen it it since 1993 and there wasn't much of it that I remembered except the big surprise which even then I had figured out a half hour earlier.The best part about this film is Jaye Davidson's performance and Neil Jordan's wonderful screenplay.  They were both unique for the time and stand up to it on this second viewing some eight years later.  The plot twists and turns and one is never quite certain where it is going. There are two story lines that seem unconnected until they connect up perfectly in the film's third act.As for Jaye Davidson he is quite amazing.  I also recall at the time of this film was out that I thought the Academy had best give him the Oscar this time because although he was young, his career would probably be limited.  I can see from his bio that it was indeed. He did a couple of small films after CRYING GAME but by 1995 he had now gone back to working in London's fashion world.  That is sad.  It would have been nice to see him get more chances to act.  Stephen Rhea on the other hand as the film's main character pretty much looked like he was sleep walking his way through it.

At the time of its release the ""plot twist"" in question was the main subject of discussion regarding The Crying Game; in retrospect, it is seen not just to be a gimmick, but also an ingenious narrative device--it fits organically with the rest of the plot, both before the revelation and after. Finally, The Crying Game is actually a film that deals with the universal theme of one's need to find acceptance and love in this world (This fact adds new dimensions to its theme song).

It just went into my head as a really good film and a rewatch would just confirm that even more. Anyway, years have gone by and it's not like I had forgotten it, but I also didn't think about the experience of watching The Crying Game. That is, until recently, when somehow I ran into the music theme somewhere. That made me watch the film again. It's probably even better now. The film hasn't lost anything, and to me that's a hallmark of a classic. Classics are timeless.

94,Fiona G.,Fantastic mingle of plots,7,20 April 2000,"What was the ""Crying Game"" all about? It is hard to say, but one thing is for sure, it was put together in a genius fashion. The viewer is unsure where it all steers at and the famous revelation of Dil's secret is only one point in the story, although it puts a lot of pepper in. Sometimes you will find that certain male viewers tend to be disgusted by even a mention of that being possible, but it seems some of them were quite enchanted by the beautiful Dil until then. In general, the cast is doing a very good job and make it easy to relate to the characters, what, in a story like that, is probably more difficult than it looks like. The script full of twists is very well written and the movie should be applauded for having the courage to kill one of the main actors right after the beginning (which is not to say, killing an actor early on always makes a great movie).If you are open minded enough for watching an individual look on the Northern Ireland problem mingled with an unusual lovestory, this is a must-see!",The Crying Game

The song-title of the movie the Crying game is a catchy song. Weird how Fergus ""kidnaps"" the ""boyfriend"" of transgendered ""girlfriend"" and becomes her ""new boyfriend"".

100,mgayles2005,Crying game...a crying shame.,6,1 February 2009,"1992 was quite a year, or I imagine it must have been. I was only five years old. I do recall voting for Bill Clinton during our elementary school election. Clint Eastwoods western UNFORGIVEN won best picture at the Academy awards. THE CRYING GAME won best original screenplay Oscar for Neil Jordan. A lot of hype was built around a shocking twist that would not have existed the internet was more accessible. In retrospect it was pretty obvious and the movie built around that shocking twist doesn't quite work.A British named Jody soldier falls victim to the seduction of an undercover IRA agent. Her associates kidnap him at a carnival and hold him hostage. Jody befriends Fergus, the only one of the group that isn't completely merciless. Jody escapes and gets run over by a tank when British soldiers arrive and obliterate the IRA agents. Fergus survives and goes to England where he meets Jody's girl friend Dil, and falls in love with her. Fergus hides the secret of his past and his connection to Dil's former lover while Dil hides a big secret from him.A big portion of the movie revolves around a twist. If you know anything about movies you know what it is. In this internet age nothing is unknown. If you have two function eyes you can figure it out. I wont ruin that twist. There may be someone out there who doesn't know it.Most of the movie is devoted the love story. I never felt a chemistry between Fergus and Dil. Dil is not a character I rooted for. I didn't think Dil was very interesting. Her obvious secret once uncovered makes her quite boring. The surviving IRA agents come back and find Fergus in England. This should have added a little juice to the story, but it didn't. I never found a reason to care about the story.The performances are solid all around, not counting Stephen Rea as Fergus. His performance felt lazy. Oscar winner Forrest Whitaker is sensational although he only appears in the first act. The Jody character has a habit of staying with you even after he's gone. The best performance comes from the actor playing Dil. I can see why the big secret stayed so secret: it was because the performance was so convincing.I personally hate twist endings. Most of the time there only done for shock value. This movie was one of those times. It was totally unnecessary and served very little purpose. Outside of the big twist the movie is not that great.",The Crying Game
101,DButcher,The Most Misunderstood Masterpiece Of Our Times,8,28 May 1999,"Neil Jordan's ""The Crying Game"" is the ultimate achievement in his career of variations on a theme. A film which has been embraced (unfortunately) by the gay community as a film about the acceptance of homosexuality, the very praise of the film for this reason has missed the point entirely.Jordan, through the story of an IRA terrorist who promises a soon to be dead British soldier that he will take care of his ""girlfriend"" explores Jordan's fascination with idea of the individual pitted against the demands of ideology. It does this in spellbinding and dramatic fashion. By the way, she's a guy. Thus the much talked about plot twist which is seminal to the story. But this plot point does not become an end, only a beginning. The IRA terrorist, Fergis (played by Steven Rea) had fallen for this ""woman"". Now, freed from the sexual feelings, Fergis still cares about her/him. When his IRA associates come back to town to plot their next terrorist act, they hold her life as a bargaining chip, forcing him to choose between the person (humanistic) or his beliefs (ideological). The unfolding of the story is riveting. If you have seen any other Jordan films, you know that this theme plays out eloquently in all his films. Whether it is Brad Pitt in ""Interview With A Vampire"" struggling with his conflicted nature or The relationship between Liam Neeson and Alan Rickman in ""Michael Collins,"" Jordan uses this theme as a powerful storyteller. While the theme of conflicted nature and being true to people over ideals may have resonance in the gay community that have misread the film, it is really a transcendent question we all face. Eloquently summed up in the age-old story of the frog and the scorpion, ""The Crying Game"" evokes with power and emotion questions which affect us all.",The Crying Game

105,duelek,Delicate Symbolism,8,30 October 2010,"The Crying Game is an impressive example of the use of twist, even after the cinema audience has experienced later movies like The Usual Suspects (1995), The Game (1997) and Fight Club (1999). After all the starting point of the story is a small-scale deception of romance set up for Jody by a small group of IRA members including Fergus, who ends up in a more original delusion and has to face its consequences just like Jody did. The two distinctive parts of the movie (in terms of location, setting, theme and even hairstyles) are very well combined with each other, both of them having the gentle ""nature"" of Fergus as their common denominators. With the exception of him, the members and actions of IRA are not sympathetic to the audience at all. One reason of it can be that watching the movie one doesn't get any idea about the specific motivations of the individual IRA members for what they do. Also the reason why a nice guy like Fergus ended up in a terrorist organization or is (at least at the beginning) convinced of the use of violence is not clear. His personal history and relations to people other than Dil and Jude (family, friends etc., we only witness to his quarrel at work during his whole presence in London) is another mystery. However this much anonymity (literally, since Fergus is Jimmy in the second part) thoroughly reflects loneliness and need for love in all the cases: Jody in custody, Fergus in exile, Dil in sexual exclusion. The deeper nature of the relationship between Jody and Dil had to remain secret in the first part but after Dil's secret was revealed it is only Fergus who tells about his own relation with Jody, when the reality is twisted again but this time only for Dil. Considering Fergus' second vision of Jody as he runs with his cynical laughter and Dil's discovery of Jude's part in her ""soldier""s kidnapping, I don't know who takes revenge from whom. But I especially liked Dil's grandiose killing finale, ironically mostly motivated by the jealousy against her victim's seductive breasts, which were the advantage of her sexual competitor against both men in comparison to herself. Like the romance of Dil and Fergus, the kind of Stockholm syndrome between Fergus and Jody has also its unusual oddities related with sexuality. It is not the bed scene when Fergus had to encounter a penis in an uncomfortable way for the first time in the movie, if you remember his help to Jody peeing, which was in turn Jody's second peeing scene, the first being together with Jude just right before being kidnapped when he had explicitly indicated how good he felt. As it can be seen, the movie is full with circular links, ironies and deceptions; connecting difficult and controversial but very different themes like the IRA and trans-sexuality in one story with a gentle and romantic tone.",The Crying Game
106,sansans_enscene,The Crying Game Review,10,26 February 2019,"Ethereal love. That's how I see this movie. Which is funny because it's not about the ease and lightness of love, but rather the weight and the burden it is to care about someone more than you should. The whole of this movie makes me look back and see it through a sunbathed filter, sleepy, and romantic. But in it's individual pieces, it's quite hard to watch. This can be credited to the casual pace of the movie despite its dark settings as well as the incredible acting by stars of the cast which includes Forest Whitaker as Jody, Stephen Rea as Fergus, and Jaye Davidson as Dil, supported by solid actors as well. Whitaker is dense and so is Rea. Their faces tell us there is so much more behind their stories. It's not just about Jody's time in the army, but rather who he's waiting for back home. It's not just about Fergus as an IRA agent, but rather about how he thinks its all a front to human nature. To Jody, there are naturally bad people in the world and to Fergus, there shouldn't be any at all.The most interesting relationship I have seen on screen in a long time is between Jody and Fergus. They experience this forbidden friendship that seems more genuine than the bullet loaded in the gun, pointed at their heads when they make a mistake. Plot is not what is necessary to me, that was never the case. This movie makes a good point in that. You don't really learn about the IRA's plans, or Jody's plans post-duty. You learn about how Jody believes Fergus is a naturally good person and about how Fergus falls in and out of love.This is where the slap-in-the-face of the movie comes into play (pun intended). The interactions between Fergus and the previously off-limits Dil is so intimate and I find that these two characters desire so many things in each other so strongly. They need each other so much but they are never able to satisfy it.The big themes in the movie are very big indeed. Trans-sexuality, homosexuality, depression, loneliness, political tension, racism, terrorism, and above all, love and love beyond meaning.Fergus was never a man of words. He really does not say much. His face could be mistaken for Droopy the dog from Tom and Jerry. However, Fergus screams pain and regret without saying it out loud. He is so sad, and this immortal and paralyzing sadness is truly something.The tone and emotions of the movie can be summarized in the song ""The Crying Game"" written by Culture Club's Boy George. It's lyrics carve a chunk out of your heart. In it's simplicity you dive deeper into its implications and in its complications come the performance of Davidson when he sings it on stage. His voice rides your emotions, and his hands, dancing around his body, lure you into a sadness that also lured Fergus in.I think Fergus knew all along Dil was troubled. I think Fergus really did know Dil was... not what he thought Dil was. I think Fergus fell in love with Jody through Dil. I think Fergus fell in love with the idea of Dil and not Dil herself. I think Dil's troubled self showed through her make up and her sparkling gloves and that Fergus saw it and felt the same way. I think people are not simple. I think people are complex. I think no matter how well you know a person, you still don't know them. I think love is ethereal and extra-terrestrial. I think love is a ghost that haunts you, like the tension felt in your chest when you hold your breath, like a breeze that blows the collar of your shirt against your lips. Like a star that collides into another.I believe love is for everyone and for no one. I believe the moon knows about the crying game. It just hides the fact, like everyone else does.",The Crying Game
107,dnjjr,A Masterpiece of Hidden Emotions by Neil Jordan,10,19 February 2006,"N.B. Spoilers within. It's hard to do justice to this modern masterpiece. Let me get this out of the way: ""The Twist."" The whole issue is a real shame to me; viewers should just stick to the complexities of the story and characters, and not  as the marketers selling the film would soon glom onto  a twist. To think that this would go on to nearly define for the world Neil Jordan's incredible movie! (Along with this, the ""I-could-see-it-coming-a-mile-away"" attitude...give me a break and just suspend some disbelief.) It doesn't matter now: the poignancy and importance of what Fergus (Stephen Rea) and Dil (Jaye Davidson) experience in this film have given it staying power. But let's start at the beginning, in Northern Ireland and the IRA, and the kidnapping of British officer Jody (the very solid Forest Whitaker). Here Fergus shows his true colors as a man, befriending Jody  his hated enemy  and proving himself something of a human beyond the sworn duties of his terrorist associations. This first 35 minutes of the film will indelibly imprint on everything that happens thereafter. Fergus's bonding with Jody cannot be helped  because of who the two men are  even as it complicates the emotions between them. The essential story narrated by Jody of the scorpion and the frog serves as background metaphor for the rest of the story: ""I can't help itit's in my nature."" Jody's revealing to Fergus of his distant lover Dil (why did he do it? To pre-avenge the terrorist acts happening to him? Out of pure love and sharing?) lights a fuse for the rest of the film, too. IRA activist and lover of Fergus, Jude (Miranda Richardson) proves herself tough in these opening sequences, but is nothing like the Valkyrie she will emerge as in Act III. Jody is unfortunately dispatched early from the picture, but the damage is done: his work on Fergus's psyche has been cemented.Fergus departs the IRA holdout, now in smithereens, and heads to London, where he becomes Jimmy. He looks up Dil, heavy with the knowledge of how complicit he was in Jody's fate. This, too, takes a constant place in the storyline and must always be kept in mind. (Stephen Rea wears his burdens in the way he talks, walks, breathes: he and Davidson are incredible.) Dil seems to be able to take care of herself just fine (dumping the the dufus Dave, for example), but once she meets Jimmy she falls in love. The feelings are mutual. At the club where Dil performs, bartender Col (a smooth and perfectly knowing Jim Broadbent) mediates the tentative relations between grieving Dil and searching Jimmy/Fergus. So, the decisive moment: the big reveal. Dil says honestly, ""I thought you knew."" And later (with the film's many touches of grim humor): ""Even while you were throwing up, I could tell you cared."" Fergus has another dream about Jody afterward: now Jody is not pitching (i.e. sharing) a cricket ball, but strolling away with a smirk and a genuine sense of revenge. But Fergus needn't worry: one of the great themes in this movie is the way he can't help but stick with Dil, no matter who she has turned out to be. It's all about Fergus's (and Dil's) huge capacity for love, which has become far more universal.All comes together breathlessly in the final Act. Jude & co. show up in London and re-recruit Fergus to the cause, an important assassination. Now Jude is ruthless and jealously knows of Dil and Fergus. It's incredibly touching when Fergus shears and disguises Dil to save her life: he has put her in harm's way. (One leitmotif in this movie is the music that accompanies the intimate moments between Fergus and Dil  a little sugary but very effective.) When Fergus FINALLY reveals to Dil his relationship with Jody, she is too drugged to fully grasp. But soon she will get it, in spades. The collision between love stories and terrorist plot is unforgettable. Jude is unprepared for the emotional force wielded by the liberated Dil, whose feelings for Jody come to the fore as she has learned of how Jude seduced Jody to his capture in Ireland. Now that Dil's secret is out (in the real world), the viewer must be fair to the film and *always* keep him/herself in Fergus and Dil's heads. Their points of view are crucial to taking this film on its own grounds. This is one of the most powerful and intelligent films I've ever seen; a thriller combined with multi-layered love stories. Jordan et. al. have created an utterly absorbing and memorable tale.",The Crying Game

At heart it is a remarkable study of loyalty, identity and betrayal. A textured exploration of the nature of allegiance and friendship, the film is anchored by fine central performances from Jaye Davidson, Forrest Whitaker and Stephen Rea. Indeed, the American actor Whitaker's utterly convincing portrayal of a modern urban Briton is ample proof of his impressive range. It is perhaps Whitaker's finest performance. The triangular relationship explores the principal theme on many levels, and the fine supporting performances from Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson add to the richness of Jordan's film.",The Crying Game

111,elfinadrawer,Way overrated,3,8 March 2007,"Honestly, this isn't that great of a movie. It has two wildly disparate ""acts""--the first concerning a hostage situation with the Irish Republican Army, and the second a sort of weird love story. The first act is somewhat interesting and well done, with a good performance from Forrest Whitaker (whom I generally dislike, except for in this movie and The Last King of Scotland). However, when it abruptly ends, the plot then drags on and on with a tedious love story, the only original element of which is its unconventional sexuality. The novelty wears off fast. This sort of otherwise boring movie might have been held together by tremendous performances from its leading cast, but the acting on the part of Stephen Rea and Jaye Davidson is sorely lacking, especially the latter.

119,eoreill,A film about breaking down barriers that's still good 30 years on,8,23 June 2020,"""The Crying Game"" is a film about understanding. Over the course of two hours and across two countries, characters that come from ostensibly opposite social groups learn to understand each other, in spite of the efforts of those from their own tribe to discourage that from happening.First there is Fergus and Jody. Fergus is a white volunteer for the I.R.A., Jody a black soldier for the British crown. Fergus is charged with guarding Jody after he is captured, and his sympathy for his prisoner allows them to connect, despite their conflicting roles in the Troubles. Later, Fergus meets Dil. They are, in a number of categorical ways, very different, but they form a bond as well. It isn't easy, and doesn't happen immediately, but their mutual good will makes it possible.If you thought ""The Crying Game"" was a film about the Troubles, you'll likely be surprised. It isn't, and it is, though not in the way you might expect. Surprise may be the film's defining characteristic, especially the way the plot turns from act to act. I won't give away any more than I already have; suffice it to say that the script is excellent. Not just in the twists and turns, but also the dialogue, which is brought to life with stellar acting, especially by Stephen Rea, Forest Whitaker, Jaye Davidson, and Jim Broadbent in a bit part. Everything is done well, including the soundtrack - its feature song, performed with moxie by Davidson before a rapt barroom crowd, gives the film its title.Well-written, acted, and directed, ""The Crying Game"" remains a relevant and gripping watch almost three decades after it was made.",The Crying Game

I was first drawn to the film because of its twist but was engrossed from the beginning by the truly moving story of friendship and caring that can take place in the most trying of conditions. That I ended up sympathizing with the protagonists surprised even me. They have so many layers that seem to mesh together so well and even their different tastes didn't get in the way of their friendship.There are a couple of surprises in the movie, not just one twist making this a complex and compelling story to watch more than once.",The Crying Game
121,snen,has not aged well at all,2,6 September 2018,"I can see why this was popular at the time, since there were almost no portrayals of trans people at that time, but it has not aged well, and in all honestly, it is not a good movie. it starts out with a bizarre, terribly mixed dub. It shows up a few more times, basically whenever there is a lot of movement. it seems the director didn't know how to record sound while there's movement. there's of course forrest whitacker's terrible accent, but on top of that, basically everyone has terrible acting. it is simply melodramatic. there is no character or relationship development. we don't understand how forrest and the main character become friends so quickly, really. Sure, there's some bonding moment, but the main character seems to fall into it too quickly. Forrest acts like a naive child. is he trying to manipulate him, or is it simply bad acting? it's hard to say, especially since everyone has similar performances throughout the film. the same with him and dil. suddenly they are in love and will do anything for each other, but why?? why won't he tell dil what's going on at all? also, if you know the twist, the whole movie is really obvious, and by today's standards, all of it is a big ""so what?"" I would say the only thing I really enjoyed, though it was still heavy handed, was how the metro is portrayed before and after he realises dil is trans. before, there are still plenty of hints that this is a gay bar, but they're fairly lowkey and subtle. like maybe yes, this is a gay bar, but it's pretty lowkey and chill. when he walks in right after he finds out, you say way more people of the same gender dancing together, and more people are wearing campy outfits, wigs, etc. more clearly gender nonconforming/non cis folks, some of them (and some cis guys) checking him out. the bar tender even is a bit more campy. i thought that was an amusing touch. but overall, if you are, like me, a millennial who were always curious about this movie you weren't allowed to watch as a kid, just heard whispers about... i'd just say skip it. it's mostly just annoying",The Crying Game
122,SuperMario2,Good but overrated...,7,30 July 2003,"Perhaps because I had seen the film before (years ago), the major twist was nothing new to me and didn't strike me as it probably should have.  That being said, I found the movie to be good but overrated based on what I had heard about it.  The storyline is familiar but the way things play out are not and that's where the film benefits.  There is strong acting throughout and I stayed interested, but once the film ended I wasn't extremely moved and didn't think too much of the proceedings after having turned off the TV. All in all, a good movie worth a viewing but not more than that...7/10.",The Crying Game
123,Hjernekrigen,The greatest movie ever made!,10,11 August 2005,"I don't use the term ""greatest movie ever made"" lightly. I actually NEVER use it, except for when it comes to this masterpiece. Superb performances, exceptional writing (which won Neil Jordan an Oscar) and battles with ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Psycho"" for having the biggest surprise/twist in a movie - ever! A twist which, like with the other two films mentioned before, was so respected that people DIDN'T spread the word about its nature. But it's not great because of that famous twist. It's great because it simply works on every level on a haunting, gentle and very simple way. Nothing is forced, and the whole thing (twist not-with-standing) has one of the most unpredictable stories ever told on film. Starts out as a hostage thriller, then turns into a drama, then an intimate love story and then ... well, I wouldn't want to give anything away to the unlucky person that has missed one of the greatest cinematic experiences in the history of film... Don't go on being left out. Give in to ""The Crying Game"" now!",The Crying Game
124,espenes-ebay1,great movie despite what I expected,10,6 February 2015,"I expected this movie to be rubbish. I'd never seen it before, I'd only heard it referenced in popular culture, in movies, TV-shows, etc, where they made fun of it.So I expected it to be horrible. But it was not. It was great. It had everything. It had action, shooting, suspense, violence, comedy. Romance. The unexpected.If this movie wasn't the way it was, it'd be far higher rated. It's simply a very good movie, with very good and accomplished actors in it, and a very good storyline.I would watch it again.",The Crying Game
125,delicreep,"Wonderful,",8,14 December 2001,"I watched The Crying Game for the first time during a summer film class. Even after sitting in a lousy classroom for 3 hours (lecture +film+lecture) I was buzzing when class ended. The performances are uniformly excellent, and the writing as well. Any film that can swirl a mix of sexual and political commentary into such a satisfying and unpretentious experience gets high marks in my books. See it!",The Crying Game
126,philipmurphy,"To understand Northern Ireland, start here",10,24 March 2002,"To understand how a person could end up killing for an ideal (or not) in the modern world, see this movie.  Its the best take on the IRA ever done in film.  And, hello!, its all about identity.  The movie works on many levels, yet never looses its way.  The casting is spot on, and the description of Northern Ireland and the passions, stupidities, confusions and human connections that run altogether to spawn a modern ""terrorist"" struggle ring true even in the most unexpected scenes.",The Crying Game
127,jen-97547,Truly Great Filmography Within Industry,10,28 April 2020,"A film before its time and perfectly placed in time. It crosses all boundaries and stereotypes to reach inside your basic thought processes so it can rip your heart from your chest. That makes it an instant classic in my book. It is a unique take on two people going through their own wars-actual war along with a deep mental war, both before and after. It goes above and beyond portraying the rawest of the the human conditions: love, need, acceptance, the unconditional search.
This film is beautifully made, portrayed, acted, directed, written and displayed on the screen for those that could think outside of the box at the time of its release. It took uniquely great humans to think beyond what they see and actually understand the deep underlying message without freely tossing stereotypes and slurs around. Today, the two main character portrayals are more widely accepted which makes it easier to absorb for the general masses.
In the movie business during these years people were not accepting or open to any filmography that showed different types of love and/or sexuality, but again, they missed the actual message of the film. Broken down into its simplest form it's merely seeking, finding and trying to hold on to acceptance in a very intimate form.
It is about the absolute, most basic of human needs: Unconditional Love. The need in us all to have just one human being take us as we are after everything has been stripped away. Two people sharing life, love, happiness, nightmares, joy, trials and tribulations.
I consider this film and all the actors portrayals within it to be pure art. Take a moment, watch the film and process all the emotion within.",The Crying Game
128,grantt,"SPOILER: ""Sick and silly homoerotic rubbish""",1,5 February 2000,"Evidently a cult movie with the homosexual set, The Crying Game is a homoerotic fantasy based on a deeply disturbed transvestite character, Dil, implausibly mixed up in Irish terrorism. The blurb speaks dishonestly and misleadingly of the film as ""a romantic thriller"" without disclosing its homosexual character. Irish terrorists should sue. The film should carry a health warning.",The Crying Game

Holy crap, I know it's from 1992 but ""SHOCKING""?
The most ""shocking"" thing I could see from the movie, without spoiling it for others, was the goldfish bowl scene which was supposed to be funny. It's not and kinda cruel 😢
Everything else was fairly predictable, but if you choose to see it, make up your own mind...",The Crying Game
130,enefeb2007,queer-looking fellow,10,12 February 2007,"My friend told me that this movie actually about a male spy who disguise as a woman call Dil and goes to IRA territory. Then he approaches one of the members which is Fergus to wheedle him for some information. And that guy Fergus gradually falls for him and finds out who he really is when he tries to make love to him. So the spy tries to kill Fergus. My friend told again that this movie was a racy story, obscene and I was not supposed to watch it. So I decided not.Then I saw Stargate. And I was awe-struck by the appearance of the actor who plays the Amon God Ra. Turn different angle, he looks like a girl. Turn other angle, he looks like a boy. ""Who's that?"" ""That's the guy who plays Dil!"" my friend said. So I watch it. And it is awesome! Turn different angle, he looks like a female. Turn other angle, he looks like a drag. Turn different angle, he looks like a female. Turn other angle, he looks like a drag. Even when he shows his male attributes, his face looks like a female. That's odd. Congratulation to those who could see he is a drag from the start. Because the person I know who watched the movie with me confessed she was confused. Through the shocking scenes and everything, especially when she saw the sweet, exotic face of the actor at the end of the movie. She was still confused. Albeit this crying-jag, queer-looking fellow, the story is a real corker. Marvelous acts. Fabulous soundtrack. Quite tremendous success in movie making. It's worth watching. It's not just a movie. It's a masterpiece of art.",The Crying Game
131,hammer_time89,amazing film,10,19 November 2005,"This is one of my favourite films of all time. There is so much hatred in the world today that makes you loose faith in things, but this is a film that gives you faith in humanity. Fergus is such a genuinely kind person, this tale of platonic love is incredibly moving. I love how even when he finds out about Dil, that he still loves her in a platonic way and goes to jail for her. It is a moving and thrilling film, and you will be enthralled by the characters. Jaye Davidson is absolutely amazing there, as is the rest of the cast. This is a film for the very open minded and any one with any preconceptions will not appreciate the film fully, in my opinion.",The Crying Game

134,swbarrow,Intriguing and Compelling!,7,18 March 2003,"I watched this movie recently for the first time.  I knew all about the movie from the hype it got 10 years earlier, and I knew what to expect, so it wasn't really a shock to me (especially since I also dated a transexual shortly before the movie came out).  I found myself also wondering if Jody had set Fergus up knowing that he would be killed.  However, the movie focuses on the 'true nature' of people, considering the frog and scorpion story.  I think that Jody genuinely liked Fergus and, due to life experience, knew that it was in his nature to be kind.  Because of this, he wanted Fergus to visit his lover knowing that once he met her, there would be a strong chance that he would take care of her.  He also knew that, if anyone else was going to be able to get past Gil's physical problem, that it would be Fergus.I enjoyed this movie immensely and would recommend it to anyone interested in an adventurous/intelligent/romantic movie.  And figure out for yourself if it was all a nasty last-resort prank played on Fergus by Jody, or if it was a loving last-resort plea to have Fergus look after Jody's ill-fated but beautiful lover.",The Crying Game
135,SouthWalesJesus,Interesting but underwhelming,5,26 April 2011,"I have just finished watching ""the crying game"" on Film4's films for life, and must say I was underwhelmed...I can see how when it was released it would have been highly controversial and like practically nothing that came before it. And for this reason it was probably deserving of the awards it won. The acting is admirable, as is the directing etc but truthfully I just didn't enjoy it. I was only three years old when it was released and have seen many films which I'm sure had the way paved for them by crying game before watching the original, but compared to later movies with similar content or controversy it is just lacking something.The truth is I just didn't enjoy watching it, I found my mind wandering, which is never a good thing when watching a film. The twist that was so shocking in 1992, but today's standard is rather predictable (I won't go into further detail for spoiler purposes) what happens after that was where the beauty of the writing comes to fruition, it was too late for me by then. Bottom line, if you are a movie buff you should see this movie to appreciate the quality or writing and acting, but if you want to enjoy a film you can probably give this a miss.",The Crying Game
136,mark_fmt,guys! this is 100% in rottentomatoes.com!,10,9 April 2007,"The twist did not matter to me. I knew that Dill was male because I knew that the actor playing him was nominated for best supporting actor. What mattered to me is the creation of the film. It was well written. It was well directed. Wow! I never thought Neil Jordan is a very good director. And of course the musical score! It was very familiar. It has been overused by many other films and soap operas. I know now that that familiar score came from this movie. And the acting of the cast is just superb! Here is Forest Whitaker in an unrewarded earlier film. (He really deserved his long overdue Oscar!) My favorite scene was the shooting scene near the end of the film. It resembled the shooting scene in Scorsese's classic, Taxi Driver (1976). It was realistic and strongly acted. Come on guys! This is rated 100% in rottentomatoes.com.

137,junktrash-2,Forever fighting....,9,14 October 2007,"This is a great movie. While ""the scene"" achieved great notoriety and some think that's all the movie is about, it's really about so much more. The desperation of the Irish to achieve freedom from England is very much on display here. Like other ancient feuds around the globe, the passion on both sides is evident in their willingness to do just about anything to advance their cause(s). It's also a powerful, if strange, story of human love. Complicated, deeply felt, real love. The kind that would make you sacrifice virtually everything to prevent the one you love from suffering pain. Excellent acting makes this a worthwhile investment of time. A film to remember and cherish.",The Crying Game

140,fredfirth27,How Could Anyone Think This is Good?,1,30 October 2012,"This movie has received a great deal of critical acclaim, but I'm not sure why. The Crying Game has incredibly poor pacing, with characters being given little back story, confusing, abrupt cuts between scenes, and important plot points being thrown in with little introduction. Character motivations are unrealistic, as when Jody explains that he was not actually attracted to Jude, and as also evident in Dil's odd relationship with Dave. The movie's score is sappy and the approach to visual composition is mediocre. I think the reason this movie has received acclaim is because it made a daring move in including the IRA and transsexuality in the plot, but that doesn't excuse the poor structuring of the film. The plot itself could be good if combined with a more thoughtful approach to editing and visual/audio atmosphere, and with a better script and acting. Even Forest Whittaker couldn't pull out a good performance out of this disaster.",The Crying Game

This story took me for a spin. Sure, the direction and acting has flaws that damn near every 90s movie has. But it's 2+ hr runtime isn't enough to elaborate on everything this movie has to offer. I would've watched a 3+ hr version, were it ever made. I wish I had the vocabulary and eloquence to explain all the things this film made me feel and all the themes I noticed and explored in my mind during and after. This is a movie I can watch over and over again. Much like Before Sunrise, I love the characters and despite lacking a significant backstory I find myself musing over who they are and how they lived.

And the nature is something one shouldn't try to suppress or pretend it's not the way it is. Just pay attention to the music which underlines opening credits and the one that comes with end credits and you'll get the whole picture.

143,susanelizabethfetzer,Life-changing film that will give you a whole new perspective,10,30 November 2015,"Released in 1992, The Crying Game was considered to be one of the most controversial films of its time, and it featured one of the most well-kept secret plot twists in movie history. This film was criticized in both the UK, where it was filmed, and in America, but for entirely different reasons. Within the UK, The Crying Game was not well- received because of the underlying political issues, particularly the sympathetic portrayal of an IRA agent. In the U.S., the film was criticized mainly for what director Neil Jordan referred to as ""sexual politics."" These specific elements, however, were precisely what drew audiences to the film. Neil Jordan's outstanding film deals with important themes of race, nationality, gender, and sexuality in a way that has opened my mind to a whole new approach to filmmaking. I have a tremendous appreciation for the way this film pushed boundaries, not for the sake of shock value but because it was absolutely essential for telling this story. It is my belief that artists should to be able to freely express themselves in their work, however contentious it may be. Controversial topics like those in The Crying Game should be embraced and celebrated rather than shied away from.",The Crying Game
