0,TheLittleSongbird,Nowhere near as bad as was expected,6,19 September 2016,"Of the two Hercules films released in 2014, this one is the far superior of the two. The other being the awful 'The Legend of Hercules', with Liam McIntyre as its sole saving grace. 'Hercules' was very flawed and was very misleadingly advertised, but it was decent.Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson is a charismatic and likable Hercules, and much closer to what Hercules should be like than the disaster that was Kellan Lutz in 'The Legend of Hercules'. He is not a ""great"" actor, but there is something appealing about him here, he does look more comfortable than some of his other performances (he has come on a lot since 'Doom' for example) and he has fun with his one-liners.Rufus Sewell in a different role is amusing, and even funnier is a scene-stealing Ian McShane, although his material is basically a big running joke it's a very funny line and remarkably doesn't wear thin or become repetitive. John Hurt very rarely gives a bad performance, many performances of his are magnificent in fact, and while he has been better he is good here. Ingrid Bolso Berdal is a striking and strong presence as Atalanta.Mostly, 'Hercules' looks good, looking more of a cinematic release than the straight-to-DVD-schlocky look of 'The Legend of Hercules'. It's beautifully shot and while one is reminded of '300' the editing is not as stylised or as indulgent. Costumes and sets are much more tasteful and easy on the eye. There is an appealing over-the-top-ness with the odd embracing of the cheese factor without being too ridiculous, and the darker moments do have tension and emotional weight. Love the chemistry between Johnson, Sewell and McShane, and it is definitely the film's strongest asset. What there is of the action is exciting enough, and the music is fitting and pleasant even if not mind-blowing.Brett Ratner's direction is a bit routine however, and the story, while with good moments and at least it is clear what it's trying to be, is generic and over-familiar. The script is not as bad as that of 'The Legend of Hercules', but does feel underwritten and clunky, while of the characters the only really interestingly developed ones are Hercules and Amphiarius. The rest are stock, especially the villains, who are poorly played.Joseph Fiennes in particular is catastrophically bad to the point of unintentional comedy. The special effects are a little weak as well, rather artificial.All in all, nowhere near as bad as expected. Not in terms of advertising, it was actually pretty intriguing but those wanting a proper adaptation of the legend will find themselves short-changed (the only resemblance really is in name only), but more in correlation to how much 'The Legend of Hercules' stunk and there was the worry that 'Hercules' would be as bad or worse. Luckily, while still heavily flawed, it is much better. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Hercules
1,SnoopyStyle,The man living the legend,6,15 March 2015,"It's 358BC. Hercules (Dwayne Johnson) is a world wearied mercenary with his nephew Iolaus spreading his legend of the Twelve Labors. With seer Amphiaraus (Ian McShane), sharp-tongued Spartan Autolycus (Rufus Sewell), mute Tydeus and Amazonian Atalanta, the group works for gold. Three years earlier, he returned to Athens ruled by King Eurystheus (Joseph Fiennes) after his heroic Twelve Labors. He hoped to live in peace with his family but his family was slaughter. Ergenia is the daughter of Lord Cotys (John Hurt), the ruler of Thrace. They hire the mercenaries to battle a sorcerer named Rhesus with an army of Centaurs.I really like the idea of a man Hercules living the legend of Hercules. Dwayne Johnson is a terrific charismatic presence. He is what's right about the movie and none of what's wrong can be laid at his feet. The movie shows flashes of what it is intended to be. The problem is that director Brett Ratner screws it up a little at a time. The movie should make it clear at the beginning that Hercules' legend is all exaggerations. This should be a movie debunking all of the legend. Only at the end should the movie show his one moment of supernatural strength thereby proving his legend. Also Lord Cotys' turn has to be much more overt for Hercules to change his mind. Ratner doesn't have it in him to be truly great.",Hercules
2,boblipton,I Actually Liked This,6,10 October 2020,"Dwayne Johnson plays Hercules as he goes from a mercenary for John Hurt -- the English one -- to someone with a conscience.I expected this to be about as ridiculous as The Legend of Hercules, released the same year. I was pleasantly surprised. Not only is the production and cast first rate, with some fine cinematography by Dante Spinotti, but director Brett Ratner's staging allowed me to play the ""where did they lift that shot from"" game; I identified bits from SAMSON AND DELILAH, SPARTACUS, and CONAN THE BARBARIAN during the denouement alone.It's based on a graphic novel by Steve Moore. Because he got no money from it, Moore asked fr his name to be removed from the credits. He died soon after he made the request, and so wound up not only with the credit, but a dedication. All free to the producers!",Hercules
3,Prismark10,Demigod adventures,5,23 February 2015,"The Legends of Hercules is a well known tale and often told on the screen. Director Brett Ratner's film stars Dwayne Johnson, Ian McShane, Rufus Sewell, Joseph Fiennes and John Hurt. It is based on the graphic novel Hercules: The Thracian Wars and tells the stories of Hercules as an overblown tale recounted by his nephew.The film is a pleasantly entertaining adventure film shown in an updated manner with good special effects, some knowing humour but there is nothing too spectacular or eye catching.Dwayne Johnson plays Hercules in a more human manner. However although showing the physical prowess, we also know that Johnson has enough charisma for the big screen that he has shown in previous films. This is not fully explored as he just seems a little bland and therefore wastes his talents.",Hercules
4,kosmasp,Less Hercules more Rattner,5,2 February 2015,"If you don't buy into the myths and like a story to be as funny as possible (also predictable), you can watch this freely. If on the other hand you might have issues with the ""comedy"" on display here and the lack of action scenes (I have only seen the theatrical cut), you might wanna over-think watching this movie.Irina Sheyk might have gotten to know the Rock (Dwayne Johnson) better than the movie itself suggest, if you believe the rumors, so at least one ""good"" thing came out of this. Even though C. Ronaldo might disagree. But relationships off (and on) camera aside, this is simple Popcorn entertainment, like it or not",Hercules
5,jboothmillard,Hercules,5,19 August 2016,"There were three films made about the famous Greek mythological hero with great strength in 2014, I'd heard about this version, only a little about the terrible Kellan Lutz version, and nothing about the John Morrison version, this was the second of the three to be released, directed by Brett Ratner (The Rush Hour Trilogy, Red Dragon, After the Sunset, X-Men: The Last Stand). Basically in Ancient Greece 1400 B.C., Hercules (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) is the powerful son of Zeus, king of the gods, and leader of a band of mercenaries, but he has suffered his entire life. Hercules has carried out twelve arduous labours, including killing the Hydra and the legendary indestructible lion, he has also lost his family, causing him to turn his back on the gods, finding his only solace in bloody battle. Over the years Hercules has been warned of six similar souls, they are only bonded by their love of fighting and presence of death, they never question who or where they fight, just what they will be paid, these mercenaries have been hired by Cotys, King of Thace (John Hurt) to build a great army. These lost souls however will have their eyes opened to how far they have fallen, and Hercules will prove his worth as he battles his enemies, and of course overthrow the vicious rule of Cotys, in the end Hercules is victorious and his companions bow to him. Also starring Ian McShane as Amphiaraus, A Knight's Tale's Rufus Sewell as Autolycus, Aksel Hennie as Tydeus, Ingrid Bolsø Berdal as Atalanta, Reece Ritchie as Iolaus, Joseph Fiennes as King Eurystheus, Tobias Santelmann as Rhesus, Peter Mullan as Sitacles, Rebecca Ferguson as Ergenia, Isaac Andrews as Arius, Joe Anderson as Phineas, Stephen Peacocke as Stephanos, Irina Shayk as Megara and Nicholas Moss as Demetrius. Johnson is certainly suited to the leading role because of his muscly body and has enough stern, he looks good wearing the lion's head and loincloth skirt, Hurt is surprisingly sinister, and the other well known supporting cast members are fine as well, the story is just about simple enough, the special effects for the Greek monsters and big sequences are good, and the fight and battle scenes keep you watching, overall it's a fair and reasonable action fantasy adventure film. Worth watching!",Hercules
6,paul_haakonsen,"The man, the legend...",7,8 July 2016,"Right, well given the background of the movie, being Hercules and all, and it starring Dwayne Johnson, then I must admit that I didn't have the highest of hopes or expectations to this 2014 version of the legendary Hercules.I did find myself very surprised throughout the course of this movie, because it turned out to be a very entertaining and enjoyable movie. And hats off to the writers for coming up with a more plausible and realistic approach to the tale of mighty Hercules. And also a hats off to Dwayne Johnson, because he really impressed with this movie, as he carried the role quite well.I am not going to go into details about the storyline, because I assume you already are more than familiar with tale and myth of Hercules. But this movie differs, because director Brett Ratner took a very hands-on and pragmatic approach to the story, keeping it quite real, though with a hint of fantasy.There was a good continuous flow to the storyline and the various events that took place along the way. There was a very visible red line throughout the entire movie, without any confusing detours or distracting sub-plots.The effects in the movie were quite good, but the fight scenes were particularly impressive. And there were lots and lots of fight scenes. And the CGI creatures in the movie looked realistic and quite nice, as did the rest of the CGI that was added to many scenes.One thing that did sit like a thorn in my side was when Hercules used the f-word. Yeah, he did that, which was very periodic inappropriate. He said ""f-ing centaurs"", and at that point I was fearing that the movie would take a turn for the worse. But luckily it was just a single slip.The cast in ""Hercules"" were doing good jobs, and they had some very good talents on the cast list. And these actors and actresses were portraying some richly detailed characters that were quite impressively brought to life on the screen. Dwayne Johnson carried the movie quite nicely, although it was somewhat of an acquired taste to see him with that set of hair and that beard. But also Ian McShane, John Hurt, Rufus Sewell and Aksel Hennie really brought something very distinct to the movie with their on-screen charisma and ways of portraying their respective characters.""Hercules"" is a very enjoyable and entertaining movie, especially if you enjoy the fantasy genre. Just keep in mind that this is not a full-blown fantasy movie. I was genuinely surprised and entertained by ""Hercules"" and I am rating it a very solid seven out of ten stars.",Hercules
7,utgard14,"""All the gold on Earth is not as convincing as a pair of breasts.""",3,2 November 2014,"Earlier this year we had the ridiculous Legend of Hercules. Now we have this, directed by Brett Ratner, who sucks at life as well as filmmaking. I'm not surprised in the slightest that he would produce a movie lacking in any merit whatsoever. It's a textbook example of a big dumb action movie. Which is fine, in and of itself. I'm not a film snob. I've enjoyed many BDA movies over the years. But I generally like the ones that have something interesting about them to recommend: great action, snappy one-liners, colorful characters, good special effects, some sense of style. This has none of that. It's a shockingly dull action movie. Dwayne Johnson's Hercules is no fun at all. His line delivery is monotonous. He rarely, if ever, smiles. His hair, beard, and dirty appearance make him look like he belongs roasting weenies on a hobo fire under an overpass somewhere. Well, roasting weenies and injecting steroids. He's surrounded by respected British actors slumming for a (hopefully) good payday.There's not a unique moment in the movie. It's all cribbed from other fantasy/action movies. The set pieces are all uninspired. The CGI is spotty, particularly for a major theatrical release. It's really just a boring movie with no value and nothing to recommend about it. Dwayne Johnson may be The Rock and have personality to spare, but movies like this do him no favors. He's not a serious dramatic actor. He needs to stick to lighter roles that play to his strengths. Avoid pieces of excrement like this.",Hercules
8,neil-476,Another case of false advertising,7,8 August 2014,"Hercules and chums are mercenaries, pressed into service for Lord Cotys to put down a rebel uprising which looks likely to overthrow the throne.The trailer teases this movie as being a myths and monsters movie: it isn't. It's a fairly routine swords and sandals actioner, and the mythical critters teased in the trailer all come before the opening title, and are either tall tales depicted, or things seen unclearly from a distance. What is left is a rather dark film with a lot of battle action, pitched uneasily at a level which is too graphic for family viewing and not graphic enough for those who like blood and dismemberment.There is a single F word - unnecessary and out of place.Dwayne Johnson does this stuff well - he looks good, has great physical presence and, even when the part is somewhat darker than usual, he remains very likable. The supporting cast are all quite good - it was interesting to see Rufus Sewell playing a goodie for once (kind of like a young Ian McShane even though McShane was also in the film, with all the best moments of humour), and John Hurt gets to play both ends of the spectrum, meek and scenery-chewing.I quite liked this - it is certainly a lot better than this year's previous Hercules offering - but felt that it was a missed opportunity: they promised me monsters and then didn't deliver them!",Hercules
9,Uriah43,"One of the Better ""Hercules Movies""",7,22 August 2015,"In the ancient days of Greece ""Hercules"" (Dwayne Johnson) was acclaimed to be the illegitimate son of Zeus and a mortal woman. Needless to say this didn't make Zeus' wife Hera too happy and as a result she sought to have him killed. Recognizing this Zeus had her agree that if Hercules could withstand 12 challenges known as the ""Twelve Labours"" then she would leave him alone. This movie essentially begins with Hercules having successfully navigated eleven of these trials and wandering the land of Greece with several companions at his side looking to hire themselves out as mercenaries to whoever has a righteous cause and money to back it up. This results in a young woman named ""Ergenia"" (Rebecca Ferguson) coming to them and asking for their help in battling an evil warlord who is attempting to conquer the land of Thrace. Being promised his weight in gold Hercules and his companions accept. What they don't realize is just how difficult the task is about to become. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this is certainly one of the better ""Hercules movies"" ever produced as it combines generous amounts of action and modern special effects to a rather good overall plot. Admittedly, some of the action was over-the-top but that's probably to be expected from a film of this sort. In any case, I enjoyed this movie and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",Hercules
10,FlashCallahan,Unleash the wolves.......,6,30 October 2014,"After twelve arduous labours and the loss of his family, Hercules turned his back on the gods finding comfort in bloody battle. Over the years, he has gathered a group, their only bond being their love of fighting and presence of death. They never question their path, just how much they will be paid. Now the a king has hired them to train his men to become a great army. But all is not what it seems......Its a Brett Ratner movie, the man who made Chris Tucker the highest paid actor in Hollywood, and is responsible for the atrocity that is Tower Heist, so understandably, I had reservations, but apart from Tower Heist, his films have been enjoyable, and they always have a lot of spectacle, so I gave it a chance.And it's not bad, not good by any means, but compared to the Renny Harlin take on Hercules earlier this year, its a lot more fun.Johnson is always a pleasurable screen presence, he made a huge mistake with Pain and again, but his films are always watchable, and plus, this has a wonderful supporting cast, from John Hurt, to the hilarious McShane, they all add something to the mix.But, the film plays it safe and tries to hark back to the eighties too much. Imagine Conan The Destroyer, with a hint of Commando, plus lots of sidekicks, and this is the result, entertaining, but very predictable.Hercules gets introduced in a wonderful way, (the first twenty minutes are brilliant), but then it seems to lose its way. They get hired, have a battle, have another battle, get double crossed, and the have another battle. Exactly what you would expect from this type of film.Effects are good, but the writers really waste Fiennes in his role, and it ruins the film. He pops up at the beginning, and then at the end, and it seems like he's channelling Lee Evans with his voice.If they dropped him, and recast Sewell as the main villain,this would have been A Knights Tale, they should have just had Hurt as the King.But I'm not a film maker, and this does exactly what it says on the tin, sword and sandals, and Johnson.",Hercules
11,Wuchakk,"The Rock is great, but the movie's banal",6,9 November 2014,"""Hercules"" (2014) stars Dwayne Johnson in the title role where fantastical aspects of the legend are attributed to storytellers and the movie focuses on an exceptional man with great strength.You have to be careful with humor with these kinds of sword & sandal flicks because too much of a tongue in cheek approach will spoil it. They had just the right amount in 1982's ""Conan the Barbarian"" that kept it from being too heavy without turning into a joke. They try to do the same with ""Hercules,"" but aren't as successful. I prefer the more serious approach of ""Troy"" and ""King Arthur."" I always thought The Rock (Johnson) had the potential to be a great action star, like Schwarzenegger, and ""Hercules"" proves this. In fact, he's better, but Arnie had better movies. I'm hoping Johnson will get better films too, although ""Hercules"" isn't bad, it's just that the first half has a been-there-done-that feel, not to mention the we're-only-taking-this-so-seriously vibe. Thankfully, the second half gets better whereupon we find out not all is as it appears. I also like Hercules' likable band of misfits that become their own family. BOTTOM LINE: ""Hercules"" is a well-done sword & sandal fantasy/action romp, highlighted by The Rock in the eponymous role, but it's too hackneyed and campy compared to its betters.The film runs 98 minutes and was shot in Croatia and Hungary.GRADE: C+ or B-",Hercules
12,zetes,"Hardly terrible, but not very good, either",6,27 July 2014,"Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson stars as the Greek demigod. He's probably the only human being alive who could credibly play Hercules, at least physically. I don't think I'd call Johnson a great actor, but he has a certain charm. I like to think of him as the modern Schwarzenegger - sure, he's not a great actor, but his films are fun and he's always a fun presence. I wish this film gave him a character with a little more humor, because that is the area in which Johnson really excels. This Hercules is a pretty glum character, a little aged and still suffering from the death of his wife and children, whom he thinks he murdered. The premise here is that Hercules fought with a team of warriors (Ian McShane, Rufus Sewell, Aksel Hennie and Ingrid Bolso Berdal) and allowed his nephew (Reece Ritchie) to pass along the stories of his exploits as tall tales. He is not a demigod here, just a mortal with some dedicated friends and a great PR person. The story has Hercules and his team come to Thrace to help a king (John Hurt) repel some rebels. Hercules and co. have to train up the Thracian army. I like the whole team Hercules aspect, but the story isn't particularly interesting. The action sequences are well done. I don't much like the look of the film, all CGIed up and a dull brown colors. Among the cast, I think Sewell did a great job, and I also quite liked Berdal, a Norwegian actress who kind of reminds me of Nicole Kidman. Overall, not bad, not good. Worth a look on video, maybe.",Hercules
13,namashi_1,The Rock is Super as Hercules!,6,14 November 2014,"Dwayne The Rock Johnson is super as 'Hercules' & also the best thing about the film. Though this epic-adventure is fairly entertaining, it never towers above its heavy lead star.'Hercules' Synopsis: Having endured his legendary twelve labors, Hercules, the Greek demigod, has his life as a sword-for-hire tested when the King of Thrace and his daughter seek his aid in defeating a tyrannical warlord.'Hercules' is a throughly watchable film, although not memorable. Reason? Ryan J. Condal & Evan Spiliotopoulos's Screenplay is ordinary. Although the action-sequences are simply outstanding & Brett Ratner has directed the film well, the Writing Material doesn't offer any wow moments, which certainly acts as a minus point. Nonetheless, 'Hercules' never bores & the prime reason to that is The Rock. He's simply perfect as the demigod, enacting the protagonist with strength & charisma. A Fan of The Rock, like me? Watch 'Hercules'. He's just getting better & bigger!",Hercules
14,Hellmant,"Could have been an epic adventure film, like the original 'CONAN THE BARBARIAN', instead it closer resembles 'RED SONJA'!",5,5 August 2014,"'HERCULES': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The second feature film about Hercules this year, following 'THE LEGEND OF HERCULES' (starring Kellan Lutz in the title role). This one stars The Rock, as the Greek demigod, and it was directed by Brett Ratner. It's based on the graphic novel 'Hercules: The Thracian Wars' by the late Steve Moore (although he wanted his name removed from the credits, and advertising, due to the fact that he received no pay for it). The screenplay was written by Ryan J. Condal and Evan Spiliotopoulos and tells the story of Hercules, and his band of mercenaries, being hired to stop a ruthless warlord. The film costars Ian McShane, Rufus Sewell, Joseph Fiennes, Peter Mullan and John Hurt (who also appeared in two other sci-fi flicks this year; 'SNOWPIERCER' and 'ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE'). I enjoyed this a little more than the last big screen Hercules film but I still found it to be pretty mediocre and average.Dwayne Johnson plays Hercules, a man who is said to be the demigod son on Zeus. He now leads a team of mercenaries while his nephew, Iolaus (Reece Ritchie), tells tall stories about him; to help perpetuate his image. Hercules, and his associates, are hired by Lord Cotys (Hurt) to train his Thracian army in battle; against a vicious warlord named Rheseus (Tobias Santelmann). Hercules soon finds himself wondering if he's fighting on the right side though. He also deals with nightmares from his past, dealing with his family being murdered (possibly by him).The movie is basically a big budget bad B movie; it looks great (especially in 3D) but that's about all it has to offer. Johnson does make a good Hercules but I was hoping they'd do much more with his character. This could have been an epic adventure film, like the original 'CONAN THE BARBARIAN', instead it closer resembles 'RED SONJA'. Other than the action it's just boring. The other characters are boring too (with the exception of McShane). Johnson and Ratner have both done much better films.

15,FeastMode,my notes,2,25 June 2019,"Except for a few good action parts, everything about this movie was terrible. especially the acting by the rock. not only was he an awful actor, he was the only one in the movie without an accent and it was so noticeable. in a few parts, he tried to use an accent, but only one word in the sentence would have the accent (1 viewing)",Hercules
16,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Rock, paper, demi-god.",5,18 November 2018,"'Hercules (2014)' takes an interesting approach to its story and the mythology surrounding its central character - though it's an arguably less interesting approach than the more conventional or, rather, expected one (especially since this was the one that the trailers heavily pushed). It also has a decent lead performance from the rarely, if ever, unlikable Dwayne Johnson - or 'The Rock' (as he was still then partially known). However, neither of these things can prevent the piece from ultimately being a pretty generic, bland and almost entirely forgettable entry into the rarely engaging middle-big-budget 'fantasy-history' genre. 5/10",Hercules
17,bowmanblue,"One great big silly, fun cliché",7,3 December 2014,"There's nothing worse than a film that's completely clichéd in every way. Or at least I thought so until I watched 'Hercules.' It's absolutely everything you've seen a thousand times before, therefore it's a mystery as to why I enjoyed it as much as I did.From what I hear it's hardly based on fact (and when I say 'fact' I mean the Greek legend of Zeus and Mount Olympus etc). Instead, it's based on a comic book which, in turn, is based on the classic tale of Zeus' half human-half god son, Hercules, and his adventures. Seeing as I've completely forgotten everything I learned about Ancient Greece at school and I've never read the comic books, I can't comment on how well it ties into whatever source material it's based on. However, I can tell you that – if you're in the right frame of mind – it is quite good fun.Dwayne 'The sometimes Rock' Johnson plays our titular character and he plays him with as much charm as you'd expect from our muscle-bound leading man. Many have criticised him as an 'actor,' but then he doesn't need to do an awful lot of soul-searching to find inspiration to smash every baddie he encounters in the face. He does the job. He's cool. He's likable. And he wipes the floor with monster he meets.And Dwayne's not alone in his quest. Unusually, we get to see quite a lot of his mates, namely the band of warriors who follows him wherever he goes, generally picking off anyone who's still alive after Herc has beaten an entire army to a pulp. Yes, his homies are all walking clichés, but they're also fun enough to root for and it's simply nice to see that, despite being 'part immortal' on his father's side, even Herc needs a chum or two to get things done.Do you really need to know what they do? There's a baddie doing bad things. Herc and co have to stop him. Don't bother wasting any more time on plot intricacies than that.The film runs for an hour and a half and, if I'm honest, it actually feels a bit rushed. If they'd added an extra 20-30 minutes of character development, they really could have made something quite epic (as opposed to a fun little B-movie). Perhaps the worst thing about it is the computer-generated effects. And they're worse at the beginning. Seriously, there are some scenes near the start that looked like they were created by a media student for his homework assignment (they do get better. A bit).If you want to know what sort of mind frame I was in when I watched this, I'll tell you. I was home from work with a cold. I didn't feel 100% and was wrapped up under a blanket as I watched Hercules and his posse kicking ass. I didn't want a deep and meaningful, heart-wrenching drama or anything I had to think about. I just wanted a fun little action movie to rest my brain to. And I got one. If you find yourself in a similar state, this is the kind of movie that should nurse you back to full health.",Hercules
18,ThomasDrufke,"Hercules, The Son of .......",5,20 November 2014,"All I wanted out of this movie was an entertaining adventure out of the strongest demigod. What we got was pretty much the opposite. Don't get me wrong this film has it's fun moments, almost all of which come from Dwayne The Rock Johnson's one liners. But the film doesn't at all give us what the trailers promised us. Hercules isn't even a demigod. He is just a legendary warrior who happens to have a following that create his back-story.The Rock was a great Hercules. He, much like Arnold in the old days, has a tremendous amount of charisma and charm that carries over well to all his roles. But even he couldn't save this by the numbers swords and sandals flick. It's a very interesting move on the part of the filmmakers to not have him actually be Zeus' son, I give them credit for having the guts. But it didn't pay off. Some of the best parts of the Disney Hercules movie was this half god man defeating these huge and terrifying beasts. It was his journey to becoming a hero. But instead this film focuses a great deal on the war-like battles he helps the people of Thrace in. I realize some of these comments may come off as too nostalgic or that I'm not reviewing what I see instead what I wanted to see, but the reality is the film didn't deliver.If there is a sequel, which there very well could be because it was semi-successful, I would hope they change up the back-story somehow. It's just a waste to have The Rock playing Hercules and not give the character what it deserves. Not much of the cast stuck out as giving great performances or bad. And the film is pretty predictable. The spectacle was nice though. I actually thought the effects were great for the most part and the battle sequences weren't anything to scoff at. I just don't think it was enough to overcome the films major weaknesses.+The Rock's charisma +Biggest and baddest Herucles yet +Looks great-Takes away the best part of Hercules -By the numbers -Predictable, nothing stands out 5.9/10",Hercules

So just bring it! The movie is about the legendary hero Hercules (Dwayne Johnson), whom just finish completing another labor of his 12 labors. He's ask by Ergenia (Rebecca Ferguson), on behalf of Lord Cotys (John Hurt), who wants Hercules to train the armies of Thrace to defend the kingdom from bloodthirsty barbarian Rheseus (Tobias Santelmann). Hercules agrees to it, due to the weight in gold that Lord Cotys promise his group of mercenaries when the task is completed. After training the army, Hercules and his men lead them into battle against local barbarians only to find out that there is something going on, more than it seems with this war. Dwayne Johnson really does look the part with the long beard, lion coat and cub, more than any previous film adaptation. He somewhat plays Hercules with heroic tone and charm, I haven't saw since the days of Kevin Sorbo. Rock's Hercules is capable of showing moments of vulnerability and soulfulness, while also being able to throw a horse and knock down marble statues. Still, besides from the action, the Rock felt like he was holding back with his personality. I wish, he was able to bring in, more of what makes the Rock, the Rock. You know, his charisma. While, Hercules could be kinda boring, he's surround by great character actors, as his band of mercenaries. There is the spear-wielding prophet Amphiaraus (Ian McShane) who has a death-wish. Then there is the knife-throwing hot headed thief Autolycus (Rufus Sewell), the feral warrior Tydeus (Aksel Hennie), storyteller Iolaus (Reece Ritchie) and last, the Amazon archer Atalanta (Ingrid Bolsø Berdal). They did most of the humor for the film. It would had been funny to see Hercules do some stable cleaning. Sadly, there isn't any of that. The action was kinda realistic, but some of the blows from Hercules was a bit over the top and cartoony for a real saying the myths about Hercules is BS. It wasn't that bad, after all, it's Hercules. He supposed to have Demi-God strength, supposedly. I have to say it's pretty damn violent for a PG-13. After all, how many PG-13 movies, do you know that has bloody decapitated heads nail on a stalk, hundreds of dead bodies, and limps being rip apart? It felt like 2003's Troy, at times, just grittier. The battle scenes were pretty damn impression, but often clichés with battle speeches, training montages, and turn coats. I just glad, it didn't go with the whole slow-motion 300 movement crap that a lot of sword & sandals films are doing these days. The only down side from the action scenes is the CGI. This film had some of the worst CGI, I have ever saw. Thank Zeus, it was shorten used. The whole first ten minutes were really rushed as hell. For a movie that 92 minutes, long. It's full of non-stop action. I like how the myths and the legends take a backseat for realism in this film. I think, for people looking for Gods and monsters. They will be disappointed. Don't believe the trailers for this film. The movie tease that they might be real, but never show them. There is a good reason for this and the movie explain it, well. Hercules encourages people to tell tall tales so that enemies will fear him and allies will be motivated by him. The myths people tell are exaggerated, but although still impressive. The villains weren't that great, in my opinion. I wish, Joseph Fiennes had a bigger part as King Eurystheus. He's such a good actor, who I think is downplay to the point, that I rarely notice him. John Hurt was alright, but cartoony over the top. Historical, the movie is not. The dialogue is a bit, modern for a Sword & Sandal film. Iron Age instead of Bronze, Roman war tactics, but it's just nitpicking. The music by Fernando Velázquez was alright. The movie is one of two Hollywood-studio Hercules films released in 2014, the other being Summit Entertainment's The Legend of Hercules. It's way better than the Legend of Hercules in every way. The movie did come with some controversy. Steve Moore, the recently deceased author whose name is used in the promotion of the film wanted to have his name disassociated from the adaptation, according to an interview from his friend, acclaimed author Alan Moore of 300 fame due to that fact, that Steve Moore received no payment when it was picked up by a studio, contrary to his understanding of his publishing contract. Another reason is that the studio remove Hercules's bisexuality storyline from his graphic novel. His friend, Alan Moore brought all this to light, has accused the filmmakers of using his death as free advertising and urged a boycott of the movie. The ads for the film avoided any mention of it being based on a comic book to save face. Overall: Despite what Alan Moore wants you to do, I have to recommend watching this film. The film was a pleasant surprise to me, and I'm pretty glad, I end up seeing it.",Hercules
23,The-Sarkologist,Exploring the reality behind the myth,7,4 August 2014,"When I was just about to walk into the cinema I updated my Facebook status to say 'I am going to regret this' to which one of my friend's replied 'you sure are'. As it turns out I didn't regret it, despite it being nothing like those incredibly ridiculous Italian Hercules moves of yesteryear (even though I only ever saw one). I also said to another friend 'so, you're Greek. Are you going to see Hercules?' to which he responded that it was too Hollywoodised for his liking.Okay, Hercules does not follow one of the traditional Hercules stories from the ancient world (the most famous being his twelve labours) but it certainly does touch upon them. What really surprised me was that it also touched upon the events of The Madness of Hercules (Heracles Furens), the story in which Hercules goes mad and kills his wife and children shortly after returning from war. In fact, that event plays a very important role in this film, though the way it works out was completely unsatisfactory for me (probably the one thing that annoyed me about the film).However, it was not so much the film that caught me, but the theme that runs behind the film. As a sword and sandal action flick, it is a good movie, but if it was just that then maybe I would have regretted the $20.00 and the two hours I spent watching it, but it does go somewhat beyond that to explore the nature of mythology and legend. The statement made at the beginning of the movie is that it is a story about the Hercules that we do not know and that story is, believe it or not, that Hercules probably did walk upon the Earth, and he probably did perform those twelve tasks, it is just that myth and legend have exaggerated the story somewhat. There are a number of aspects that create these myths, such as your basic horseman being described as a centaur, humans masquerading as monsters to terrorise a village, and a warrior being demonised as a sorcerer to create fear and loathing in one's subjects. Then there is the question of who was the father of Hercules. The stock standard answer is Zeus, but is that really the case? Did Zeus really come down to Earth and impregnate Hercules' mother? Most likely not, but that does not mean that Hercules never existed because of that one thing. In fact, more likely than not, it was just an excuse that his mother made when her husband discovered that she was pregnant and that he was not the father.",Hercules
24,Floated2,Less of Script,4,31 May 2015,"Hercules (2014) in this version of the myth, Hercules is something of a Robin Hood figure, surrounded by a band of merry mercenaries who decide as the movie begins that they need just One More Payday to make them wealthy enough to buy last names and retire.Said comrades include Ian McShane as Amphiaraus, whose powers of prognostication virtually guarantee that he'll get to mutter ""Never saw that one coming"" at some turn of events. Aksel Hennie is Tydeus, mute except for one well-timed utterance. Reece Ritchie is Iolaus, Hercules's nephew and the group's chronicler. Rufus Sewell is Autolycus, who at one point leaves the gang, taking all the treasure they don't want — the Han Solo exit I believe it's called.",Hercules
25,poe426,Deconstructing Mythology...,5,17 February 2015,"Granted, Mythology's just THAT- Mythology; larger than Life stories about larger than Life folks... but HERCULES??? It was bad enough when Sam Raimi oversaw the televersion (which I couldn't watch for more than a few minutes without moaning piteously, like some skewered lamb bleeding out before the coming feast), but here we have a Big Time production company shelling out some major-league Money and whadda we get...? Cgi and a Hercules so down-to-Earth that he ain't even really related to Zeus. He's a construction worker who hangs out with his drinkin' buddies and somehow becomes the stuff of Myth. Unlike JERKULES (the aforementioned TV series), however, HERCULES DOES manage to come across as a fairly close approximation to Robert E. Howard's Conan- closer than any of the movies have come so far, anyway (and that ain't sayin' much...). Johnson kinda sorta LOOKS the part, but the movie as a whole leans more toward JERKULES than memorable Mythology.",Hercules
26,leonblackwood,Expected Better! 4/10,4,6 December 2014,"Review: I'm kind of in two minds about this movie because it starts off well but then I got a bit fed up with it after a while. I don't think that there was another actor that could have played Hercules, but the rest of the cast was pretty poor, except for John Hurt and Ian Mcshane. The storyline also wasn't that great and there wasn't that much depth into the characters past. Basically, Hercules and his team, go around Greece helping people tackle there enemies for money. He is then asked by John Hurt to take on these weird warlords, only to find out that he is being double crossed by the people he is willing to help. Its  really basic storyline which could have done with a little more thought. Apart from that, some of the fighting scenes weren't that bad but I did expect a different twist on such a classic concept. Average!Round-Up: I know that Hercules was an extremely powerful warlord, but the beginning, when he is wrestling with a lion and this huge sea monster seemed a bit ridiculous. It's not that it didn't look impressive because the director made good use of the CGI but it just seemed really over exaggerated. The makeup team could have done a better job with the Rocks wig but thats just me picking at straws. Anyway, there's enough muscle bound action to keep the audience entertained but I personally found the movie weak and not that memorable. I honestly think that it was the hype surrounding the movie which made it a blockbuster success but I think that the director would have to invest in some decent actors if he wants to make this a successful franchise.Budget: $100million Worldwide Gross: $243millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action adventure movies about Hercules fighting against savage warlords to save a village. 4/10",Hercules
27,Vartiainen,Different take on the Hercules legend,6,17 April 2015,"A movie based on the graphic novel Hercules: The Thracian Wars by Steve Moore, where we get to see Hercules who's a bit different than the figure of legends, myths and Disney films. In a sense the Hercules you'd get if you put him into the real world, with a touch of Conan the Barbarian for flavour.Dwayne Johnson makes for a fantastic Hercules. He has the physique, obviously, but he also has the presence, the enormity of character such a legendary figure requires. He is very much larger than life and you get why so many stories were told about this man and his labors. I hope they make a sequel and get Johnson to reprise his role.I also enjoyed the supporting characters that come from the graphic novel. Amphiaraus (Ian McShane), the fatalistic warrior prophet who believes to know when he's about to die and thus fears no battle before that day, is easily my favourite, but they all have their moments and work very well together.I do admit that the story could have been a bit stronger, but it's not bad by any means. It lacks that spark of uniqueness and/or greatness the best movies have, but it keeps the plot going and all of the characters are given their moments. It's a film you're going to see for its characters and style, the story is there to keep things going.Hercules was a pleasant surprise. My initial impressions weren't that high, but it pulled me in with its characters, charm and entertainment value. Recommended.",Hercules
28,DarkVulcan29,"Just popcorn fun, nothing more",8,31 July 2014,"A little better than The Legend of Hercules, but this film is just meant for fun popcorn type of thing, it never tries to be anything else. Dwayne Johnson as Hercules feels like The Scorpion King that gets renamed Hercules, his performance is no different.All in all an entertaining action film, where everybody gets a chance to shine, even John Hurt has the king. The scenery is nice, fight scenes are alright not great. It's not a 300 type of film. I was entertained by this film, but didn't really love it, and probably won't wanna own it, it's just a one time film for me, I felt Dwayne Johnson was a little out of place in this film.",Hercules
29,PWNYCNY,A credible movie.,8,8 August 2014,"Surprisingly, this movie has a coherent story and almost succeeds in actually being dramatic. Dwayne Johnson delivers an impressive performance as Hercules, half-god/half human, who has to prove to the world that he is for real, and not just a hyped up legend. It would be easy to dismiss this movie as just another overblown live cartoon with a bunch of comic book characters with personalities that are about as deep as a puddle of water. But that would not be accurate. The movie actually deals with certain themes that give the story depth (yes, depth). One can root for Hercules without being embarrassed and can take the movie seriously. The problem with the movie, and this is a problem for all these action-adventure half sci-fi-half fantasy movies, is that they are so obviously potboiler productions that even when an effort is made to actually tell a serious story, it still comes across as cheesy. But that's just the nature of the genre.",Hercules
30,stevendbeard,Good Hercules Adaptation,8,25 July 2014,"I saw ""Hercules"", starring Dwayne Johnson-The Fast & the Furious movies, Tooth Fairy; Ian McShane-Snow White and the Huntsman, We Are Marshall; John Hurt-Snowpiercer, the Harry Potter movies; Rufus Sewell-Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, The Legend of Zorro and Ingrid Bolso Berdal- Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters, Chernobyl Diaries.This is a good Hercules movie-a lot better than the last one that came out. This one is based on a graphic novel called 'Hercules: The Thracian Wars', and is directed by Brett Ratner_X-Men: The Last Stand & all three of the Rush Hour movies. Dwayne plays Hercules, who is still the son of the Greek god Zeus and a human female-so he is called a demigod-and he is stronger than the average man. He still had his twelve labors to perform and then he settled down with a wife and had a couple of kids. One night, after passing out from drinking, he wakes up to find his family dead-he has no knowledge of what happened and he is blamed for their deaths. He goes on the road to forget his problems and becomes a mercenary, along with a few of his friends, including Ian, Rufus and Ingrid. Ian is a psychic or a seer, which comes in handy-he even knows when and how he himself is going to die. Rufus prefers knives and is a pretty good fighter, although not quite as strong as Herc, and Ingrid is an Amazon archer-she is pretty fast and accurate with her bow & arrows. John is the ruler of a town that is being raided by centaurs-half man/half horse creatures-and some half dead looking people so he hires Herc to train his army and lead them to victory. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, language and some sexual situations-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 38 minutes. I really liked it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Hercules
31,XweAponX,Very Interesting rendition of the Mythos,10,26 November 2014,"I loved the imagery of this, it had all of the aspects of Hercules/Xena which I loved. But here, when the imagery is used it depicts not actual events, but how the legend has been passed down by mere mortal men.Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is as much Hercules as any actor who has portrayed the DemiGod, Kevin Sorbo notwithstanding. Dwayne is more than a sheer bulk of rocky flesh, he is one damned fine actor as well, and I have loved his work since the time he guest starred in Star Trek: Voyager and beat up ""Seven-of-Sixty-Nine"".The landscape of this film is fantastic, some of it real, some of it excellent Matte Paintings. And as Dwayne and his merry band of Mercenaries- Including Ian McShane and Rufus Sewell (Amphiaraus and Autolycus the King of Thieves)- pass through it, we are reminded of how legends begin.I haven't seen Joe Fiennes since ""Enemy at the Gates"", does the man ever age? And once again we have John Hurt. But the real standout here is Ingrid Bolsø Berdal as ""Atalanta"", who really knows how to unleash a can of Whoop-Arse on screen. Aksel Hennie is the non- speaking animal-man and of course the whole story is rendered by ""Iolaus"" - Reed Ritchie, who, unlike the side-kick from the 90's TV show, is not allowed to fight.We are given many images in this film that depict old Greek legends, only to have them revealed as mundane things later. I suppose this is how any story changes from historical account to embellished legend.Because we don't remember heroic figures as mere men, we always grant some kind of godlike quality to them. And what do we remember? Just like ""The Man who shot Liberty Valance"", we remember the legend- Because that's what we as mere men need to hear.",Hercules
32,alindsay-al,An above average film that is better then you expect,6,6 March 2015,"There were two Hercules films last year and the best thing I can say about this film is that it is a hell of allot better then the legend of Hercules. This film sees Hercules and a group of mercenaries are hired by a king to take down a rivaling nation until something suspicious comes up. Now Dwayne The Rock Johnson plays Hercules in this film and I thought he was great in this film. I am a big fan of the rock and I liked what they did with his character and he is a great action star. The supporting cast were all good too, Ian mcshane was great in this film with his character getting more depth to him which made him the best character. John hurt was great in his role as the king and his character had depth to him. But even though the other characters are cool they lack depth to them to make them truly interesting. I liked how the story made Hercules a bit different considering they made him a merc which was a nice surprise, also I liked the twist that they had in the film. But for the majority of the film it goes just as you expect and it is by the numbers really. The script was a bit better then I thought it was going to be with some great humour, however, there was also a lot of cliché dialogue in the film. The action scenes were styled really well and looked good, however, the cgi is bad at times and does take you out of the film. Overall this is an above average film that you could watch and enjoy it.",Hercules
33,estebangonzalez10,I am Hercules!!!,6,27 October 2014,"""Are you only the legend, or are you truth behind the legend?""Hercules was one of those rare cases where I was glad the film was nothing like the trailer was portraying it as. From the trailers I was expecting yet another Clash of the Titans sort of fiasco, but I was pleasantly surprised the film took an entirely different approach. Instead of portraying the Greek mythology as something completely accepted in this world, it actually is just a myth that some have more trouble than others in believing. Hercules is one of those silly action films that rarely work for me. I tend to find these sort of action packed movies where there is very little character development dull and boring. Surprisingly however, the action sequences looked impressive and somehow I was engaged by the characters. For the first two thirds of this 90 minute film I was on board with the breezy and light hearted action, but unfortunately the final act included an uninspired twist that didn't work for me. I felt like the film rushed to the conclusion and tied things up too neatly. Hercules has many flaws and lacks depth but it makes up for all of this with some slick visuals, engaging action sequences, and an impressive lead performance from Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Brett Ratner won a lot of enemies when he ruined the X-Men franchise for many fanboys, but he has also made some entertaining and decent films like Red Dragon and the first Rush Hour. Hercules may not be a great film, but it was much better than I anticipated and I had a decent time with it despite being predictable and pretty straightforward. Perhaps the best thing going for Hercules is the lead performance from The Rock who completely drives this film and engages us with the title character. He is an action star with a lot of charisma who happens to sell the funny moments as well. Ian McShane also deserves his share of credit for the comedic moments of this film. He is great in his secondary role as one of Hercules's sidekicks who also seems to have the ability of foreseeing his own death. Rufus Sewell, Aksel Hennie, Ingrid Bolso Berdal, and Reece Ritchie each deliver as part of Hercules's faithful companions and despite not having any depth to them whatsoever I still managed to care for each one of them. The greatest weakness of the film might be the lack of a strong villain and a somewhat unbelievable twist. All in all, Hercules is decent enough to give a mild recommendation from my part.",Hercules
34,Fluke_Skywalker,Epic blandness,5,10 November 2014,"Though it's certainly brisk and boasts substantial action, Brett Ratner's 'Hercules' is never-the-less a dull, neutered PG-13 entry in the sword and sandals genre currently dominated by the likes of '300'.For the bulk of its running time, 'Hercules' remains without a villain. Consequently it flows from one monotonous action scene to the next, giving us little reason to care about the outcome. The third act ""twist""--which you can see coming despite the fact that it never once tips its hand--still manages to be unsurprising and feels cheap and unearned. That it actually breathes some life into the story says a lot about the film itself.The normally charismatic Johnson seems to have been put in check by the clunky script and ham-fisted direction of Ratner, and without his sizable charm, the film sinks like, well, a rock.",Hercules
35,sauravjoshi85,Surprisingly good,8,18 January 2019,The movie is a period movie and full credit to Dwayne Johnson for playing the role with perfection. This movie might not be as grandeur as Gladiator or as gorgeous as 300 but still this movie possesses a charm in it. The start of movie is little slow but it will not disappoint you. If not perfect then a good period drama.,Hercules
36,r96sk,Mostly disappointing,6,4 May 2020,"Mostly disappointing, 'Hercules' fails to deliver in what should've been a thrilling action film.It's still an OK production, with a few decent qualities. Dwayne Johnson is perfect for the titular role, even if it isn't one of his best performances; the iffy wig doesn't help either. Ian McShane and Aksel Hennie are good casts, though both are a little underused throughout.I didn't like the multiple villains, especially as none of them really stand out. Away from McShane (Amphiaraus) and Hennie (Tydeus), I don't think they got the correct actors for Hercules' team - the remaining lot all slightly irritated me in different ways.The plot isn't the greatest here either. I did actually enjoy the ending in truth, it's the best part of the film... everything up to that point plods, as well as having rather obvious plot devices. The overall score could've been better, also.It all accounts for unsatisfying viewing, unfortunately.",Hercules
37,3xHCCH,"A Sword and Sandal Version of ""The A-Team""",6,27 July 2014,"In this latest film with the Greek hero in the title, Hercules (Dwayne Johnson) is shown to be a mercenary for hire, who uses his mythic demigod origins and legendary ""labors"" to advertise himself. He has with him his band of cohorts, the loyal Autolycus (Rufus Sewell), the mad fighter Tydeus (Aksel Hennie), the Amazon archer Atalanta (Ingrid Bolsø Berdal), the young storyteller Iolaus (Reece Ritchie) and the seer Amphiaurus (Ian McShane).The king of Thrace Cotys (John Hurt) hires Hercules to beef up his army against the vicious centaurs led by Rhesus (Tobias Santellman). However, ulterior motives and political ambitions are soon revealed such that Hercules had to dig deep into himself in order to break free of the nightmares that haunt him and draw out the real hero in him.When I saw the trailer with the hydra, boar and lion, I thought this Hercules film would be tackling the legendary labors of this Greek hero. So despite the fact that I found Dwayne Johnson's Hercules hairstyle very awkward-looking, we still went to watch it, in 3D no less. I was disappointed that this sequence would be over and done with in the first few minutes of the film. The rest of the film was just like a ""sword- and-sandal"" version of the ""A-Team"".Despite the story, the action sequences were quite good though. There was that very long battle sequence with graphic close-up violence which looked more realistic than the stylized battles in the ""300"" films. Director Brett Ratner is known for his action films and his skills show in these exciting scenes. The 3D effects were also very good, with all the arrows, spears and debris hurtling out at us as we watched. The cinematography and visual effects were also well-done. Dwayne Johnson could not seem to get himself into the period. Even if he is wearing those ancient warrior costumes, he speaks and acts as if he was in the present day. You can't deny his good-guy charisma though. Ian McShane stands out as the prophet Amphiaurus. He figures in the single LOL-moment in the film, which was really came at the most welcome moment to break the grim monotony. It was good to see Joseph Fiennes back on the big screen after a long absence, albeit for a short role. He plays King Eurystheus of Greece, with whom Hercules had a major falling out.In the technical aspects, this is still better than the Kellan Lutz film ""Legend of Hercules"" we saw earlier this year. Overall though, mindless popcorn that it is, ""Hercules"" was still an entertaining action film aimed to get our adrenaline going.",Hercules
38,aharmas,Bit disappointing,5,4 August 2014,"At first I didn't think ""The Rock"" would make a good Hercules, but once I saw the film I couldn't say anything negative about him. The demi-god is after all not big on words, and this is not Shakespeare. Plus, he's got the physical attributes and the persona to pull off this job. The movie producers did a good job putting on the screen what this historical period must have looked like, and the effects are not bad at all. It was also a pleasure to see some good actors playing nasty: Fiennes and Hurt were very effective, and they chewed the scenery when required.So what happened? If you are a fan of mythology, you will be disappointed because the film only addresses the myths in reference, and we barely get a chance to see them. The film deals with a completely different ""period"" of Hercules' life, and it wasn't the best the writers could come up with. Once again, heavy on the effects and looks and not enough care going into the writing.Maybe if you are willing to sit through some barely amusing battle scenes that are easily surpassed by some of the thrills in the less seen ""Pompeii"", a film that at least had some respect for its source and spent more time in the choreography of the gladiators' fights and took care to focus on the destruction of the city. Yes, I was impressed by the destruction of the big statue here, but I would have liked to see more of the demi-god powers than a last minute turn of events to prove a point.Leave your brain outside, sit and enjoy the air conditioning and get ready to get in ""Transformers"" mode, and you'll be pleased with the loud effects and the thin storyline.",Hercules
39,peterp-450-298716,"The movie won't achieve a legendary status, but at least it was way better than ""The legend of ...""",6,4 November 2015,"""I thought heroes fight for glory. But mercenaries fight for gold.""Remember my review of ""The Legend of Hercules"" ? Probably you noticed that I wasn't really impressed by it. First, there was no sign of the ""Twelve labors"" in this film. And it was a hodgepodge of topics from various films. It looked a bit like ""Gladiator"" mixed with ""Pompeii"" and ""300"". And also, Kellan Lutz didn't have enough charisma to become a mythical figure like Hercules. That's why I was so curious about this version with Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. And although it's not exactly a masterpiece, it still could captivate me. First of all there was a small part dedicated to the labors and also because of some memorable moments.What intrigued me the most was the fact that one questioned Hercules's status as a god in a subtle way. I doubted at some point whether he really was a descendant of Zeus or simply a mortal provided with the necessary muscles and fighting skills. It seemed as if he wasn't immortal : ""Cover up, before your loyal army sees you bleed like a mortal"". It was as if he used that unique status to scare off opponents (""The more they believe Hercules is truly the son of Zeus, the less likely they are to fight"") or to use this infamous reputation as a lure for new clients. The opening scene with Hercules being assisted by his companions to hunt down a band of pirates, gave the impression as if he couldn't single-handedly get the job done.Okay, maybe it was the intention to make ""the mystery Hercules"", invincible son of Zeus, more mysterious. Johnson plays a heck of a Hercules. That's an indisputable certainty. His impressive torso and superhuman biceps filled with swollen veins make him a fearsome and imposing demigod. ""Conan"" will always be associated with Schwarzenegger. Believe me, ""Hercules"" will be the same for Johnson. An ideal role written especially for him. It's just pure joy to see this semi-barbarian screaming out loud while rushing towards his opponents, frantically waving with a huge mace. With crushed and split skulls as a result. The level of adrenaline is skyrocketing during the great battles.Of course you could say that they've borrowed from other classics. It's just like ""The magnificent seven"". A group of professional mercenaries taking upon themselves the arduous task of training a group of non-military citizens in martial art. Obviously, this army of simpletons grows out to be the most ruthless killing machine ever. In recent years we've been spoiled with epic battles as seen in ""300"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"". Unfortunately, the battles here aren't as overwhelming as the latter. And you can also feel a bit of the atmosphere from the movie ""Gladiator"" in this mythical spectacle.But unlike ""The legend of Hercules"" you can see some old timers at work here. Like John Hurt who plays the part of Lord Cotys, king of Thrace. He wants Hercules and his henchmen to defeat a violent warlord. And Ian McShane and Rufus Sewell play respectively Amphiaraus and Autolycus, two companions of Hercules. Each of them are veterans who bring some drama into the story. And there's also some humor to enjoy. The funny dialogs between the group members you definitely can call successful. Fortunately they didn't end up with a type of Bud Spencer parody full of silly jokes. The final result is a perfect balance between light-hearted humor and spectacular action. So if you're a fan of straightforward action with a humorous wink, you'll like this Hercules !More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",Hercules

The next battle faces directly Hercules and Rhesus, who has been rumored to have an a centaur army. Turns out, they're simply men on horse backs. Herc and the Thracians defeat Rhesus. But he gets suspicious when Rhesus repeatedly claims that the war is unjust. When he gets her alone, Ergenia confirms his suspicion, that Cotys killed the former king, her husband, whom Rhesus was defending. Herc confronts Cotys but Cotys dismisses him by giving the crew their gold. Herc decides to stay and fight Cotys. Except for Autolycus, the crew stayed with Hercules. They storm into the palace but gets captured with Ergenia and her son Arius. Waking up, Herc finds himself in a dungeon, with Eurystheus and Cotys facing him. Eurystheus reveals the truth of how Herc's family died. Cotys then orders to execute Ergenia. Amphiaraus motivates Herc and Herc breaks his chains loose and foils the execution. Ergenia frees the crew and Rhesus while Hercules handles three wolves. Out of the dungeon, Hercules then kills Eurystheus. Cotys finds refuge behind his army and threatens to kill Arius. Autolycus kills the soldier who holds Arius, and a battle ensues. Tydeus died protecting Arius. The group starts losing ground to the army and retreats back up some stairs and spills oil and fire onto the stairs, barring the army from them. But the soldiers form the shield wall and advance on them. Knowing the strength of the shield wall he teaches himself, Hercules then uses his strength and push the Hera statue to roll onto them, killing many soldiers and Cotys.The story doesn't really show that it was developed well, and so does the direction seemed not adequate to build and convey a solid story on screen. The opening scenes were epic into some levels, yet when it comes to the first real battle scene, the hype disappears suddenly. After that, the story builds up too slowly. The twists are so very predictable that they rather disappoint when they occur. The finale is not well designed, it felt lacking and weird after the movie ends.The action scenes are just another average mêlée blade and blunt and bash battle, with some projectiles here and there. At first I thought the action here would be better than the other Hercules movie earlier this year with Kellan Lutz in it. But how disappointed I was when I found that the level of action is just quite the same. I guess the idea of humanizing the legendary demigod and separating him from the myths makes it hard for the developers to insert more epic actions.Dwayne Johnson acted out just enough, feeling at home with a mêlée battle action dominant role, which what his background was strong suited in. From the rest of the crew, the senior names of Rufus Sewell and Ian McShane live up to their reputation, even though they're not such great stars. Yet the newer names seems rather dull in their roles and seemed as rather functioning only as a complimentary character to fill out the action sequences. Irina Shayk doesn't really do anything for this movie, especially after her performance isn't really significant though it's a crucial part of the story. Still, having John Hurt really doesn't hurt this movie in deepening the conflicts.My final say is that Hercules (2014) will only get a 5 out of 10 score from me. It's just a so-so of an entertainment, though a recommendation is a no from me.",Hercules
42,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,Seven Samurai Go To Greece,6,25 January 2021,"This isn't Greek mythology. This is The Seven Samurai (or The Magnificent Seven, if you prefer) with some names from Greek mythology and a bunch of CGI slathered over it.Duane Johnson plays the role of the bald guy who rubs his head and recruits all the rest of the Samurai (or Yul Brynner as Chris)All the way down the line to the sn0t-nosed kid representing the character played by Toshiro Mifune/Horst Buchholz.They get hired by the leader of the local impoverished shythole to save them from the rampaging warlord/bandit.

43,moviexclusive,Some good old-fashioned battle scenes and a surprisingly generous dollop of tongue-in-cheek humour combine to make this perfectly serviceable summer popcorn fun,6,23 July 2014,"Many box-office prognosticators have their bet on 'Hercules' to be the first expensive summer flop of the year, and - truth be told - before we saw Brett Ratner's take on the Greek demigod, we were just as unimpressed by what the trailers and the poster made it out to be. But the marketing of this utterly cheesy but surprisingly entertaining swords and sandals epic missed out one crucial point in its over- eagerness to sell the combat spectacle - it is also very intentionally funny.In deconstructing the myth for a modern-day summer popcorn viewing audience, Ratner and his writers Ryan J. Condal and Evan Spiliotopoulos have drawn their inspiration from Steve Moore and Admira Wijaya's graphic novels 'Hercules: The Thracian Wars' and placed our titular hero squarely in reality. As the opening narration cheekily warns, this isn't going to be the legend you're familiar with; rather, it uses the legend - including his fabled 12 labours - as no more than hearsay which his nephew tells to motivate the troops Hercules is leading into battle.But really, Hercules is just a mere mortal with superhuman strength here, who leads a band of mercenaries helping kings and queens to slay beasts and conquer foes for a return in gold. Besides his aforementioned nephew Iolaus (Reece Ritchie) who longs to prove himself in battle, the rest are just as fearless as Hercules himself - including the knife- throwing Autolycus (Rufus Sewell) with his witty asides, the spear- wielding seer Amphiaraus (Ian McShane), the super-sexy Amazon archer Atalanta (Ingrid Bolsø Berdal), and the brutish Tydeus (Aksel Hennie). They are as tightly knit a crew as anyone can ask for, and fiercely loyal to Hercules to whom they owe their lives.As man, Hercules finds himself haunted by the death of his wife and children three years ago while in the kingdom of King Eurystheus (Joseph Fiennes). Accused as a murderer in Athens, Hercules is hack for hire by the ruler of Thrace, Lord Cotys (John Hurt), who enlists his crew to defeat a warlord rumoured to be a centaur and into the dark arts. That is the excuse for the first of many well-choreographed battle scenes, which Ratner stages with more verisimilitude than one has come to expect from similar such genre pictures. Though a trained viewer can still pick out the CGI, these scenes are nevertheless exciting and thrilling, combining good old-fashioned formation tactics with Ben Hur-like chariot chases and some Lord-of-the-Rings type one-versus-many pounding.Those looking for some 'Game of Thrones' intrigue need not apply; indeed, the narrative here is as straightforward as it gets, no matter the minor twist two-thirds into the film that has Hercules struggling to make a moral choice when he realises that he and his crew may have been manipulated by Lord Cotys himself. It does however offer enough to give Dwayne Johnson to flex his dramatic muscles as Hercules, as his call of conscience gives him an opportunity to grow into the hero behind the legend. That is of course nothing compared to the physical weightlifting which Johnson is called to do in the movie, the inevitable demands of the role only demonstrating why he is such a perfect fit for it. It is difficult to imagine any other Hollywood actor today than Johnson in the character, but it is more than just his physique that we are referring to here. Yes, Johnson also couples that with charm, charisma and comic timing, attributes of which play nicely to Ratner's neat balance of camp and solemnity in tone. Johnson is also joined by a stellar ensemble, in particular Hurt's scene-chewing performance as the duplicitous ruler. Coming after such pompous predecessors like the god-awful 'Clash of the Titans' and its sequel 'Wrath of the Titans', as well as other copycats like 'Immortals' and even this year's 'The Legend of Hercules', Ratner's 'Hercules' comes almost like a breath of fresh air. It embraces its B- movie roots, doesn't try to be more than what it is, serves up a generous dollop of tongue-in-cheek fun and engaging battle action on an epic scale. Ignore the cynics - this is pure pulpy entertainment that is perfectly serviceable summer movie-going fun. After all, it takes a certain kind of movie that dares to reserve a zinger like 'f**king centaur' for its lead character in fourth-century BC.",Hercules
44,quincytheodore,"Even with The Rock's charismatic presence, Hercules is still a mediocre endeavor",5,4 September 2014,"Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson certainly has flair for on-screen presence, he embodies the character with amazing physique and intense commitment, but sadly the script material is drab and uninteresting, one that's inferior to TV show, the likes of Spartacus or Rome. It attempts to humanize Hercules, presenting the man behind the legend, which is quite admirable compared to other grandiose renditions that share the same title or action movies in general that depict superhuman characters. Unfortunately, the plot is highly predictable and aside a few decent skirmishes, it doesn't offer anything notable.The story portrays Hercules as a mercenary, although his previous acts and original are usually shrouded by excessive storytelling, which serendipitously benefits him. Along the way it delves deeper on the titular personality, shedding bits of mythical tales to reveal the actual man. This concept is sound, although neither pacing nor screenplay manages to reach that level of accomplishment. In short, it's rather boring. There are far too many similar elements from other adventure movies, even from Johnson's own Scorpion King from last decade, and it's not presented in better fashion. Humor and banter rarely hit the mark, thus making the story build up from first acts stagnant.Johnson as the star is an imposing figure, often instilling larger than life persona. How he succeeds in pulling off the worthy Hercules look is half the movie already, and to his credit, Johnson has the heart aside from the brawn. The rest of the cast are fine addition, Hercules' ragtag band of mercenary fits the bill, while John Hurt and Ralph Fiennes round up as the kings. Unfortunately, there's little engaging interaction and what transpire is pretty straightforward. Scenes flow with barely any momentum, they are very slow and plagued by average stereotypical situation.Action does happen, even if some spark of brilliance is only sighted for few brief moments. Although scale isn't as big and choreography is average, the battles are still serviceable. Use of CG, and 3D for that matter, is a bit underwhelming. For the beasts are apparently artificial, and as far as debris go, throwing them into audience's eyes is far too outdated underhanded tactic. The movie does take advantage of the mature rating to deliver more visceral combat, it may not be complex, but it has impacts for most part.The intention of displaying more human side of Hercules is noble, however with such thin content, the movie is hardly equipped for such profound task. Dwayne Johnson could probably give more to the role, but he is definitely an appealing personality suited to be Hercules. Sadly, there's not much else to the movie.",Hercules
45,MR_Heraclius,Hercules,6,24 February 2020,"Someone had the incredibly stupid idea of showing Hercules' infamous tasks within the first five minutes and then tell a somewhat conventional story of antique battles and rebellion. The Rock is a charismatic hero and his team works, too. Without this cast this movie would have fallen to pieces. As it is, the action is decent, the result entertaining enough and thankfully it doesn't take itself too seriously.

46,Screen_Blitz,"Dwayne Johnson spears in for a tense, but unremarkable sword-and-sandals adventure",5,2 October 2016,"Hercules, the iconic hero of the ancient old Greek mythologies has made for some interesting stories in both literature and cinematic media; but has faced some notable abuse in the latter category, with the critically panned 'The Legend of Hercules' earlier in the year as a example. This tense, violent epic starring the alluring action star and former wrestler Dwayne Johnson in the role of the titular hero blossoms the Greek hero in a more polished execution by the hands of director Brett Ratner. Though the film has a fair share of excitement and intensity in the bargain, the film drives in an execution that leads little to be desired and interests that eventually wears away after the first hour. Whether it's the lack of nuance in the story, or the forgettable characters; this fantasy action adventure feels more of a missed opportunity than an exciting force to reckoned with. This isn't however, to say that Dwayne Johnson doesn't deliver a solid sense of fun to the screen when the epic action sequences unfold. In this epic adventure, Hercules (played by Dwayne Johnson, son of Zeus, is haunted by his blood-stained past which involves the brutal murder of his wife and daughter. Living a life of constant suffering and bloodshed, Hercules has turned his back on the gods, and seems to have no sight of redemption. That is until Lord Cotys (played by John Hurt), the kind ruler of Thrace enlists Hercules to his band of warriors including Amphiarus (played by Ian McShane, female archer Atalanta (played by Ingrid Bolso Berdal, Autolycus (played by Rufus Sewell, and wild barbarian Tydeus (played by Aksel Hennie) on a treacherous journey to defeat the ruthless warlord Rhesus (played by Tobias Santelmann) while discovering his true image.For a valiant and powerfully endearing Greek warrior like Hercules, there are only a handful of actors in the Hollywood roster to suite the role of the titular hero, and Dwayne Johnson more than fits the bill. With his highly appealing muscular physique and equally likable personality, Johnson shines brightly in the role as the powerful demigod sporting the thick loincloth and sandals while getting the chance to show off his bare biceps. The energetic performance however, does not quite anchor the film nor does it stand out above the rest of the cast. At least, he provides just enough energy to fuel his character in the midst of this otherwise unremarkable hack-and-slash extravaganza. With the story revolving around our hero struggling with s shady past and his people questioning him of being the son of Zeus everyone recognizes him for, there should have been a more thoughtful, if not groundbreaking plot to experience in the bargain, or maybe a more compelling study on the Hercules's genesis. Sadly, the film never reaches any of these dynamic roots. While the story offers at least some interest value, it's quickly loses its appeal near the film's one hour mark, and it never cashes in any surprises beyond some brisk action sequences presenting our characters in violent sword-slashing combat. The key concept questioning the identity of Hercules as the powerful son of Zeus is quickly abandoned never left resolved. The character department on the other hand lies the great weakness that makes the film is less than engaging above a surface level. None of the supporting characters including the villain are interesting, and the cheesy dialogue doesn't do them much justice nor do the cartoonish performances by the support cast including Ian McShane -- who is given almost nothing to do, that leave them to resemble quirky caricatures than believable characters. This is not to say the film doesn't have some positive light however. The action is somewhat fun, but nothing particularly impressive above some beautiful special effects shots. The battle sequences are brutal per say, enough to push the PG-13 rating to the very edge as we witness some brief shots of CGI blood spew. Unfortunately, these sequences are the only thing keeping the film sustainable for its rather short 98-minute run-time which if longer, could have left plenty of room for a story and character with further depth.Hercules is a middling epic action adventure that had plenty of potential, but sadly never rises above the average level nor does it offer any good surprises to make it an enthralling experience for all seeking for an extravagant action thrill ride. Though there is a little entertainment value to be handed during the battle sequences, the film is ultimately a forgettable entry.",Hercules
47,Troy_Campbell,Switch off your brain and enjoy.,6,25 July 2014,"Brett Ratner's mythical, action-centric yarn is everything you expect a Brett Ratner mythical, action- centric yarn to be, for better and for worse. Big and brash, but lacking in brains, this medieval-esque romp is at its strongest during the multiple fight sequences, whether one-on-one or with warring armies. Ambitiously constructed and executed with undeniable flair, the action is never less than exciting and offers up a swathe of bone crunching, limb lobbing and horse throwing (yep!) events that, although predominantly not memorable, are extremely fun in the moment. There's also a tongue-in-cheek vibe throughout that is perfect for this type of movie, allowing the inherent silliness to be enjoyed rather than derided. Yet there is also plenty wrong with this blockbuster, most notably the shonky acting and b-grade dialogue. Undoubtedly looking the part when pummelling his foes to a pulp, Dwayne Johnson – required to talk and emote in a manner other than his usual smart- mouthed, modern badass – otherwise struggles as the soulful, sensitive man mountain racked with guilt and self-doubt. John Hurt and Joseph Fiennes share the (dis)honour of being the film's worst culprits in the acting department though, their hammy, over the top performances are embarrassing and unintentionally laughable. Hercules is a typical Ratner flick, with all that implies, which is best consumed with your brain off.",Hercules
48,pyrocitor,Zero (expectations) to Hero(ically daft yet oddly endearing),5,10 July 2015,"Disney is hard to beat. So why even try?This was probably the mindset behind Brett Ratner's take on the iconic Greek demigod, so renowned his feats spawned an adjective. You can sense that the legendarily trashy Ratner is just itching to go balls out in a campy action romp with Dwayne Johnson occasionally flashing his winning grin in between thrashing CGI monster after CGI monster. In many ways, this would have been a more enjoyable movie, if only for its owning up to its willful stupidity. Instead, Ratner appears to concede that any traditionally mythological tale of Hercules wrestling the hydra and Cerberus was bound to court unfavourable comparisons with Disney's jaunty 1998 Hercules romp, with Ratner unlikely to go the distance in the match-up. To differentiate, Ratner's Hercules takes its inspiration from Steve Moore's grim graphic novel, caving to the all-too-familiar 'dark origin prequel' route. Here, the mystique of Hercules is (loudly, repeatedly) challenged, playing his legendary labours off as hyperbolic exaggeration and willfully cultivated marketing to help him find work as a glorified mercenary for hire. In terms of magic and monsters, we are fed a compulsory giant-beasts-battling pre- credits sequence (yay!) before the film slumps into 'serious mode.' Awww. For quite some time this doesn't sit well – a film opening with baby Hercules reaches for a bolt emblem on the ceiling accompanied by bombastic voice-over and triumphantly clanging music is hardly aching to be taken seriously. But, as the feeble plot kicks into gear, with Johnson's Hercules being hired to protect the city of Thrace from the forces of a tyrannical warlord by training its ramshackle army (a subplot largely pilfering the best bits of Mulan – ""somehow Dwayne'll make a man out of you""), the film finds its footing and voice somewhat. We're still firmly in budget-bloated-B-movie territory here, but before you know it, you've stopped scornfully thinking of all the things you could be doing instead of wasting time on this movie (""I never did do that second load of laundry..."") and started getting oddly invested in this silly, shoddy film. Ratner farts out some decently entertaining action mayhem here and there, but the real joy of the film is to be found in Hercules' weirdly endearing entourage, and their earnest attempts to make sense of their gritty Grecian lives. Ratner's Hercules may not have much of a brain, but it does have heart – enough so to unironically sell its own thematic claptrap about morality dictating destiny. As such, in spite of the bar being planted (not quite Hades-level) low, the film is hard to take cheap shots at. Like a dopey, clumsy puppy, you can't quite hold a grudge for all of Hercules' laundry list of flaws, simply because it seems to be trying so gosh-darn hard it's kind of cute. Johnson is perfect casting for resuscitating a movie this daft. Even when attempting to sell his Hercules as a brooding, tormented Maximus-lite, the artist formerly known as the Rock has enough charismatic to power a hydroelectric dam, and is enough of a consistently pleasant presence to continue to justify the viewer's attention. The supporting cast of 'shouldn't-you- be-too-good-for-this-kind-of-movie' character players match Johnson with aplomb, and gamely commit to their hilariously one-note characters. Rufus Sewell's snarky Autolycus and Ian McShane's cantankerous, foreboding fortune teller Amphiaraus steal all the best (surprisingly funny) one-liners, and their banter with Johnson is by far the film's strongest asset. Aksel Hennie gives a surprisingly sweet performance as the near-feral Tydeus, while Ingrid Bolsø Berdal makes for a great stoic badass as the heroic archer Atlanta. Rebecca Ferguson struggles gamely to remain sympathetic amidst the film's worst writing and uneven characterization as 'disposal love interest 101', while the always excellent John Hurt and Joseph Fiennes are effortlessly talented enough to remain enjoyable even when coasting into increasingly over-the-top screeching as the film's resident bureaucratic buffoons. Those looking for even a sliver of historical authenticity, a half-credible script, or any worthwhile thematic subtext should know better than to go near any film involving Brett Ratner with a ten-foot pole. What Ratner does deliver, however, is fun of the campiest, least demanding degree. His Hercules, dumb but oddly sweet, and elevated by Dwayne and his amazing friends, picks up just enough momentum to make sticking the film out slightly less than a Herculean feat. -5/10",Hercules

There is a tongue in cheek regard for the ""son of Zeus"" mythology and modern marketing concepts to explain his appeal.Hercules has been played by several ""hunks"" including Arnold Schwarzenegger (1970), Lou Ferrigno (1985), Steve Reeves (1957), and Mickey Hargity (1960). Johnson is physically impressive, though perhaps less so than Arnold and Ferrigno.If you're interested in the film because of the coming attractions, be forewarned that the fight with the Nemean Lion, the Erymanthian Boar, and the Lernaerean Hydra take place in flashbacks that last less than a minute.Rufus Sewell (Dark City), Ian McShane (Deadwood) and Ingrid Bertdal (Chernobyl Diaries) do a good job as part of Hercules' ""peeps"", but the film falls a little flat.

The fact that it doesn't take itself too seriously is a benefit, but I'd have liked the script to be a little stronger and the humour to be sharper, as it does stop this from being a full recommendation from me.

55,RforFilm,"By the Gods! Hercules is a better then expected action movie, though it's everything you expected.",7,24 September 2014,"By the gods! The mighty Hercules in ancient Greece was the then equivalent to today's superheroes. It's been debated for a while on whether or not a real Hercules existed, but the legend certainly kept him alive. The story is that Hercules was the son of the king of the Gods, Zeus. He lived as a mortal as he slayed many beasts that gave him his reputation as a demigod or a half god. He's been the subject of many artifacts found by archaeologists and has appeared on many works of art related to the Greeks.Now what I know about Hercules I learned from school. I have not seen any of the Italian adaptations nor did I catch The Legend of Hercules from earlier this year. When I think of Hercules, I think about the Disney animated adaption from 1997. This is the only version I've seen and I liked it, even if it was artistically misguided. That said, the movie I'm reviewing is based off of the graphic novel Hercules: The Thracian Wars which gave the legend a full personality and his own journey of exploration to find his place on Earth. The adaptation by Brett Rather (the Rush Hour trilogy) translates it to a high action-packed Hercules.If you think that our Greek hero will be fighting monsters and magical creatures, think again. This is a revisionist Hercules that tries to dispel everything that he's done. This Hercules (played by Dwayne Johnson) fights along with a fellow group of hunters including a prophet (played by Ian McShane), a thief Autolycus, a warrior Tydeus, a female archer Atalanta, and a storyteller/P.R. guy Iolaus. The team helps establish Hercules' reputation as the son of Zeus by playing up the factor that he fought mighty creatures that were actually ordinary animals or nonexistent. But Hercules is still powerful enough of a fighter that he can be no match for another person.One day, Hercules is approached by Ergenia (played by Rebecca Ferguson) representing her father Lord Cotys, (played by John Hurt) who wants the legend to train his army for an upcoming battle. The group accepts the offer in exchange for their weight in gold as a reward. Hercules does his best to build up the strength of the men and wages war with an enemy general Rheseus. The battle proves victorious for Hercules, but he's told later that this might have been a trick from Lord Cotys who has intentions on becoming an emperor of the Ancient World. The legend needs to prove the truth behind the name.When you see the posters of a loin-clothed Dwayne Johnson fighting warriors, Hercules' delivers exactly what you would expect out of that. The more movies I see Dwayne Johnson in, the more convinced I am that he's the modern day Arnold Schwarzenegger. He's very charismatic and is a lot of fun to watch when he battles his enemies. Hercules reminded me of Conan the Barbarian minus the fantasy elements and campy performances.Is the film as memorable as Conan? Unfortunately, what Hercules lacks is two things; interesting side characters and an exciting first act. I cannot remember the personalities of the sidekicks other then that they were good fighters. I don't even think that they go through any kind of change. Ian McShane is the only one I liked as he got some good lines and of course John Hurt works great as the villain (any movie that guy touches turns to gold). Part of me felt that much of the first hour was filler for the second act. Not that it was bad, but when compared to the battles and climax finale, you'd wish that the whole project worked together.I'll give this seven paintings of Hercules out of ten. It's mindless entertainment, but something like this could have been a lot worse",Hercules
56,spookyrat1,Man. Myth or a Little In-Between?,7,3 February 2020,"Hercules is a thoroughly good action film and I like the approach the film-makers take to their famous mythical subject. In general, a Troy (2004) interpretation is adopted, whereby everything is de-mystified and the pantheon of Olympic Gods is neither seen, nor heard. However using the intermittent vehicle of Hercules's nephew storyteller Iolaus of Athens, we do see some of his fabulous ""Labours"", that the man himself and his loyal band of followers are at pains to inform the curious, ""may have occurred"" in the past giving rise to his legendary status.The movie has good production values, the sets and locations are convincing and the action sequences are particularly noteworthy. The adoption of a ""magnificent 6"" arrangement also adds plenty of depth to the characterisations, rather than just totally focusing on the big guy. Good to see Rufus Sewell finally playing a ""good guy"" again, rather than his customary villain and I particularly liked the roles of the feral warrior Tydeus of Thebes and the Amazon archer Atalanta of Scythia, both played by Nordic actors, Aksel Hennie and Ingrid Bolsø Berdal respectively. John Hurt, Ian McShane and Joseph Fiennes add plenty of experience and depth to the support cast and it's quite interesting seeing Rebecca Ferguson in a fairly substantial support role, just prior to her ascension to international A - list fame.Overall Hercules is fast-paced, funny, and packed with plenty of eye-popping action with impressive effects. Action fans should be satisfied, as might those viewers, perhaps more interested in the Greek Mythology side of things.",Hercules
57,jrarichards,Liked it more than anticipated,8,19 January 2020,"Remember those American epics from the 50s and 60s (even early 70s) into which they drafted loads of top-flight British actors in order to get beautifully-voiced delivery of erudite-sounding lines? Well, you'll get plenty of that in Brett Ratner's 2014 version (of comic-book origin) - thanks to the dulcit tones and fine screen presences of John Hurt, Joseph Fiennes and the ""lookalike dream team"" of Rufus Sewell and Ian McShane, who all deliver wise and very often witty lines in nicely-created cities and indoor settings, as well as outdoor Hungarian locations.Dwayne Johnson does absolutely well enough acting his part (yes really, it's more than just the muscle). It's then fun as we see how Hercules got by with his legendary accomplishments with more than a little help from his friends (as also played by Norwegians Aksel Hennie and Ingrid Berdal, plus further Brit Reece Ritchie, who also does well); while the debunking of centaurs as men on horses, Cerberus the three-headed dog as three separate wolves and so on is a far less deflating (far more elevating) experience than you might expect. It's also nicely summed up by closing Ian McShane comments to the effect that our poor old world needs real heroes more than the legendary exploits of gods or demigods.That also hits home more than you might imagine...The battle scenes seen on the large scale look pretty impressive, with different defensive and offensive tactics deployed in a mostly plausible way; while the body count - though astronomical - is achieved by choreographed microscale violence that avoids gore or excessive detail (the film appeared on my TV screen as a ""12"").And, as in those old epics of past decades, a great deal of emphasis is put on morality and doing the right thing - ultimately if not always immediately; as realistically padded out for the 21st century with a measure of cunning and a lot of wry humour.It's all good fun!",Hercules

They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. The kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. Johnson is a unique presence in American cinema and hopefully this is a sign that he will do more of these kinds of austere, gripping character pieces more often in the future. The only thing that keeps it afloat is the sensitivity of the bilaterally desperately needy relationship between the main characters.",Hercules

But no, it was not meant to be.Instead, what we saw was the result of the studio bosses thinking, 'Oh dear, this is more like a comedy version of 300 in Brett Ratner's hands, how will we ever make a trailer that will grab peoples attention?'And this is what we saw. In fact, the trailer is pretty much the first opening lot of minutes of the film which we soon learn becomes fictional as stories are told of Hercules around fires, in pubs, and to children.With a less epic feel, and more comedic tone, we are carried into battle with Hercules and his friends where they laugh, kick ass, look pretty and kick ass in this family friendly Conan that only redeems itself in the last ten minutes.Hercules isn't bad, in fact I did enjoy it as a background movie while I was wrapping Xmas presents and it did hail a few stand out moments.

61,cinematic_aficionado,Not worthy of this mighty name,5,30 July 2014,"The demi-god who received the Hollywood treatment and a bad one at that.Hercules is one of the better known mythic figures and it is only fair and right that when you can get a decent cast and budget approved we are to be expecting a great film. Period! Let's face it, the fact (well, according to mythology) alone that he completed the 12 labours as well as participated in the retrieval of the golden fleece with the Argonauts would suffice to provide material for a mighty adventure movie, or couple of them.Instead, the makers of this movie brushed off the 12 labours and made Hercules a mercenary in the paid service of a corrupt king, not to mention made him appear uncertain to the point of insecurity the same person who in the ancient world embodied extraordinary strength and masculinity.I would not go so far as to call it a bad film, just hardly mediocre.

62,DareDevilKid,This is not Hercules - Just a Solid Action Flick,6,2 November 2014,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 2.5/5 starsAs a stand alone, swords-and-sandal action film, ""Hercules"" packs quite a decent punch. The Rock makes for a terrific on-screen Hercules, and the action scenes are well-choreographed and executed, without feeling too rushed or overcooked. But truth be told, both the plot and action have nothing to do with any of the legendary adventures of the mythical demigod.Except for stitching together a few random, threadbare vignettes of his famous twelve labors, the film does absolutely noting to play on the mighty persona and mystical aura that have kept readers and viewers enamored about this Greek demigod down the ages. Renny Harlin's ""The Legend of Hercules"" - though not entirely accurate itself - released earlier this year was a much better and way more entertaining film compared to this Brett Ratner version.Pity Dwayne, The Rock, Johnson starred in the wrong version of Hercules' tale. I don't see this franchise going very far.",Hercules

While I'm busy obsessing over one title, several others can slide past me and I'll either discover them later thanks to a website or a friend or I never find them at all. Luckily, my geekiness in other departments, like movies in this case, can also help. I've never read the graphic novels by Steve Moore that this film was based on but, thanks to this film, I now know of them and now want to buy them.Sadly, I also know about how the creator got screwed over big time when the books were optioned to be a movie.Even thought Moore was passed over tons of cash when this film was adapted (and that is something that happens way too often in Hollywood when they buy properties from artists), the film was still really entertaining and really makes me want to seek out the source material. The action in the film was very satisfying, the cast is great, The Rock was just perfect as Hercules and I really like the new direction they took with the legend—it made the overly familiar tale fresh and new.I don't really have any complaints about the film and its presentation and really dug the approach the film took. Overall, I was very entertained by this one.Hello! The name is Rev.

64,bgar-80932,Average The Rock flick,6,6 December 2018,This is basically what you expect out of a Hercules with The Rock in it. It's not bad and at times the fighting is actually pretty good but it seems to be unsure if it wanted to be an adult movie or a kid movie. Still overall I like what they did with the story making the slaying of the monsters more tall tales than reality and Hercules actually fighting with a group of mercenaries instead of just himself. He helps one side defeat the other but then realizes he was on the evil side and in the end redeems that.,Hercules
65,bbickley13-921-58664,I never doubted for a second that Dwayne Johnson would make a spectacular Hercules,7,26 July 2014,"It's way better than the other Hercules 3D movie that came out earlier this year, but of course that's not saying much. What I am saying is that the Rock makes everything three times better than it would be without him. In his Conan-mirroring role, Dwayne Johnson was perfect as the legendary Hero of Greek myth.The story consist of putting a real spin to the myth of Hercules calming he's just a man who made up a story about being the son of Zeus in order to make more money as a mercenary for hire, but a situation occurs that forces Herc to be the legendary Hero he was only faking before.Most of the action is anything but down to earth , instead very over the top, giving the essences of watching the people's champion back in the wrestling ring. The special effects on the movie were great too. I seen a few Sword and Sandal flicks recently, like Pompeii, were the special effects were really awful, but I guess that's the advantage of having Brett Ratner in the director's chair, you can a least get a string of good effects.My one pet peeve is that the 3D was not good enough for the movie to rely so heavily on the gimmick. Having things fly out at you once in a while did not enhance my movie experience with this one.Overall watching Dwayne Johnson flex his pecks in this action packed fantasy film was worth the ticket price.",Hercules

Hercules appears with a lion's hide and the story is full of twists, but in essence Hercules and his merry men are mercenaries for hire. As in most good stories, the noble forces win out and Hercules is a force for good. He works on helping the daughter of the Lord of Thrace to save the kingdom from civil war. The set up is easy and the 3D effects are in your face action. At a bit of over 90 minutes it is tolerable and allows you to experience mayhem up close. Hercules, as in most good action epic tales, spends a large amount of time setting up the case for a series. This sword and sandal action movie makes for quite an experience.",Hercules
67,ArchonCinemaReviews,"Hercules the man, not hercules the GOD.",6,5 January 2015,"2014's Hercules starring Dwayne Johnson looks at Hercules the man, rather than the legend of the demi-god son of Zeus.You think you know the truth about Hercules? You know nothing.The son of Zeus and a mortal woman, Hercules is burdened with the task of enduring twelve arduous labors in order to appease the goddess Hera, or so the legend goes. Hercules travels the land, tasked with helping others as the ultimate warrior. In the 2014 film, King of Thrace hires him and his fellow mercenaries to prepare an army to defeat a tyrannical warlord to finally reunite Greece.The 2014 film Hercules is a different tale than fans of Greek mythology may expect. As the tagline suggests, before he was a legend, he was a man. Based on the Radical Comic ""Hercules"" by Steve Moore, the screenplay written by Ryan Condal and Evan Spiliotopoulos charts the adventures of the mortal embellished and exaggerated by his closest allies to instill fear into their enemies. The Hercules audiences are shown is just a man, a glorious and unmatched warrior, but a man just the same, exploitative of his triumphs to allow superstition to supersede his legacy to veneration.Who is physically better to play the infamous demigod Hercules but Dwayne Johnson? Though his acting skills may be inferior for cinephiles to take seriously, the content of his films allow him to compensate for his acting with charisma. Unfortunately 2014's Hercules has no flexibility for the former to take place and the acting of the film is stiff overall.The film itself says ""You want to know the truth about Hercules? I prefer the legend"" and I wholeheartedly agree. Though entertaining and at times funny and containing a few fight scenes worthy of legend, all in all the film is forgettable.

69,blackmamba99971,Enigma of a movie,10,11 August 2014,"Well as far as legends go this one is the more appealing. Hercules the Demi-god clad in leather fights to save a kingdom from a tyrant on the borders Astecsus. Yet within the fold of the man himself his feats are told by his nephew to others to give a remarkable boost to his name. As his mounting jobs continue twelve trials are given to him by Hera, and Zeus to see if he really can overcome hardship in so many ways or to write his own destiny by his own hand.Other than the obvious I found this film refreshing because of the twist, and take on the beloved character written into history by scholars, or philosophers. To become a hero using his brute strength, and wits given to him by the gods. Except some did not believe such a man existed in the first place. Only someone with incredible resolve to stop a mad man from taking a throne, which did not belong to him in the first place played by (John Hurt).In the midst of battles Hercules displayed awe, and inspiring feats of fighting, using every resource he could find. Changing a page in history when he dissolved away his doubts, and finally killing a ruthless king he once hailed as a fair ruler played by (Joseph Fiennes). It is a wonderful tale of courage in the face of tyranny, as well as giving the past or future the closure to his turmoil for which he nearly went mad for... The death of his wife, and children.Dwayne Johnston played Hercules to the letter. With charisma, poise, audacity, and strength for which Hercules was known for by his peers. It gives the genre the needed boost, which will carry on long after in the archives of past films of the same subject in Greek Philosophy. He fits the role perfectly. The music was great, the action was endless, and the depth of his characters pain ran deep, which gave him his strength. I have to say in all of the Greek legends this one was always my favourite. Excellent portrayal. Highly recommended to all over the age of 16.",Hercules

It is based on the graphic novel Hercules: The Thracian Wars.Though he is famous across the ancient world for his larger-than-life exploits, Hercules (Dwayne Johnson), the son of Zeus and a human woman, is haunted by his tragic past. Now, he fights only for gold as a traveling mercenary, accompanied by a band of loyal followers, including Amphiarus (Ian McShane) and Autolycus (Rufus Sewell). However, when the benevolent ruler of Thrace and his daughter seek his help in defeating a savage warlord, Hercules must find the true hero within himself once again.",Hercules
71,LloydBayer,"Made with mind mushing incompetence, Hercules is a disappointing departure from myth and legend.",4,21 August 2014,"In the annals of Greek mythology, volumes upon volumes have been written about the rise and ultimate decline of an epoch when Gods mingled with men. From divine beauty to epic battles of courage and preservation, cinema has sparred no opportunity in dramatizing this ancient eon either. Hercules, the new film from director Brett Ratner, is not a film that evokes such cinematic glory, nor is it anywhere in the echelons of the mythology it haphazardly borrows from. In severing its umbilical ties to said mythology, Ratner's version undoes everything we have learnt in school and in cinema, by having us believe that Hercules, the product of Zeus and a mortal woman, is not really the demigod we thought him to be. Instead, Hercules (Dwayne Johnson) murdered his wife and children because his mother Hera made him do it. Talk about a nasty mother-in-law joke but given here that Hercules is named after his mother, you could be led to believe all sorts of things, including the blood line of Norman Bates. Constantly plagued by visions of this brutal murder, Hercules believes he is a mortal, while his nephew Iolaus (Reece Ritchie) believes otherwise. In fact, Ritchie's voice fills the opening scene, narrating his uncle's famed ""Twelve Labours"". We get to see the first three Labours (nine-headed Hydra, Erymanthian Boar and Nemean Lion) in the first three minutes of the film. The remaining nine Labours are either non-existent or sloppily written. Instead, Hercules is written-off as a mercenary who agrees to help Lord Cotys (John Hurt) train his Thracian armies against an invasion of barbaric hordes and Centaurs lead by Rhesus (Tobias Santlemann). The reward is his weight in gold. Going from a rock to a boulder, that's a lot of gold for Johnson's Herc the Merc, and there's plenty to be had between his band of misfit warriors - Ian McShane as the spear wielding Oracle Ampiaraus, Rufus Sewell as the knife-throwing Autolycus, Ingrid Bolsø Berdal as Atlanta the archer, and Aksel Hennie as a raging bull. What should be a piece of cake becomes a baking-oven mess when an absurd twist in the script redeems the aforementioned mother-in-law, only to reveal treachery and betrayal from the titular hero's closest allies. Somewhere in this mangled PG -13 mess (PG-15 in the UAE) is an R-rated film bursting at the seams. Along with the script writers, Ratner can't seem to decide if this is Greek tragedy or Shakespearian comedy. There are traces of both, but bland at best. To be fair, the pragmatic departure from myth has an interesting plot arc, but nothing is done to build on it. Loopholes in the script add a lot of confusion to the premise, and part of this extends into having to decide whether or not Hercules is a demigod. While this gives Johnson's Hercules some complexity, it also undermines the legend preceding his character. The name Hercules never sticks and all you see is Dwayne Johnson in leather armour with lion-skin head gear that would look fashionable in Siberia. Character misplacement adds to Ratner's debacle. So much so, some actors have dual roles, first as white pieces and then as black pieces, all before someone turns the chess board and you start all over again. John Hurt and Joseph Fiennes (as an Athenian King) are the victims here while Mc Shane barely gets away with comic interjections. Although action is fairly straightforward, nothing can be said about the hamstrung CGI used in the film's three main battle scenes, except that it complements the mind mushing incompetence of the story. For all that it tries to be (Troy or 300-lite), Hercules is still void of myth and legend and everything you would expect in an eye-brow raising action film. You won't even find Johnson raising that cocked-eye brow to signify the gig is up.",Hercules
72,p-jonsson,Enterteaining but Hercules it is not,7,24 January 2015,"A fairly entertaining movie but Hercules as most people know the story it is not. The movie blurb from Paramount is at least fairly honest in calling it a ""revisionist take"". Most other commercial texts talk about the legendary twelve labors and in general makes you think that Hercules is  well Hercules. Do not be fooled. Most of this movie goes to some length to portray Hercules as a normal man, unusually strong for sure but certainly no demigod, that have created the myth surrounding him himself with the help of his friends. If you are into Greek mythology and do not like it messed with this movie is not for you. It is a classical Hollywood rewrite focusing on action with little respect for anything else.Having said that, it is not the total disaster as is normally the result when Hollywood makes ""their take"" on something classical. Hercules and his team are a fairly charming bunch of hard hitting rascals. The revised story is not really all that bad. Simple and predictable of course, it is a Hollywood action movie after all, but it works fairly well.The movie is an action movie so naturally the main reward of this movie are the action scenes which are fairly good. Over the top, unbelievable and devoid of any form of actual military strategy of course but still quite entertaining. Whoever wrote the scenes having Hercules and his friends running around in the middle of huge battles without much in terms of protection while the rest of the army huddled down in this famous shield wall formation is no genius, military or otherwise, that has to be said. Well, at least it got Hercules some head bashing moments.If you are a fan of action movies and are prepared to put your brain in park and just enjoy the show this is a rather entertaining movie. At least this is my take on it. Some of the scenery is quite beautiful, even slightly breathtaking. It never really feels slow and the acting is on a level suitable for the movie. A slightly above average Hollywood ""rewrite"" I would say.",Hercules
73,Finfrosk86,"Just not very good. Not bad, but not that entertaining.",6,12 June 2015,"We all remember (well in my head we all do) the horrific movie that was The Legend of Hercules. Yes, it was the year where two Hercules-movies were to hit the silver screen with only months separating them. (Strange, but it is a well known phenomenon, two very similar movies coming out at almost the same time. Deep Impact - Armageddon. Capote - Infamous. Friends with benefits - No strings attached, and the list goes on)But enough of the history lesson! We got The Legend of Hercules, and it sucked. One of the worst movies I have seen in a long while. Then later comes Hercules. Now we get our Hercules-money's worth, right? Wrong. It's just not very awesome.With a movie about Hercules, you can go two ways with how you present the story. Unfortunately, they chose the boring way. Really boring. I think I know what they were trying here, and they don't really succeed. They are trying to ""up the stakes"", but instead they just up the boring.The action is alright, it's all alright.Funny thing for me, a Norwegian specimen, is that two Norwegian actors are in this. And Aksel Hennie actually does a pretty decent job. I'm not really a fan of his, but I liked him here. For me he was one of the highlights, to be honest. Ingerid Bolsø Berdal was also good. Makes me a little proud that actors from this little cold piece of land, get some Hollywood-love.But anyway, the movie, it is just not very good. It's alright. If you like muscles, Dwayne The Rock brings plenty of that! (hello steroids! It's steroids, so don't even.)I don't mind steroids, by the way, but people should know the truth.So Congratulations to the director, you managed to make Hercules boring.

74,James_De_Bello,4/10,4,26 September 2014,"4/10 This movie is simply put a mildly pleasant mess. By this I mean that even though you know exactly what to expect the moment the first frame appears on the screen, you probably didn't imagine your prediction was so spot on. The film is something that someone could have made by cutting together various scenes from the last twenty years of fantasy and action cinema. It literally rips off shots and situations from ""300"", ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Troy"" and hits every single dam note you expect it to hit. Other than the fact that five minutes in you could tell what would happen to every single character, the movie is really unbearably predictable to the point where I couldn't take it anymore and I was actually anticipating the dialogue, yes the dialogue of people on screen. This is not a hyperbole, I swear I knew everything without haven't even seen a trailer of the movie! There was not one frame of it I did not expect. It plays out by the book and offers zero, zero contribution to cinema. If there was a book with all the lines ever spoken by movie characters it would most certainly not add a single word to it after ""Hercules"" came out. And this makes me feel bad about Dwayne Johnson, even though he is animatedly supporting the movie, because I really love him as a screen presence and see in him some good acting chops combined with a waterfall of charisma, but this is not the work I would like to see him do. I really want him to challenge himself to more out-of-the-box action (and not) roles and not something so straight forward, inserted in a ten times more dull movie. He is perfectly fine in the role and most certainly holds up the movie almost single-handedly and even the rest cast brings an acceptable job, only a couple come off as annoying, but they can't save the banality of the movie. Story-wise, other than being more predictable than rain in London, there are so many elements that make no absolute sense. It goes on relying on object and situations that come out of nothing, the time-span is all over the place and character motivations are or obsolete or seen-one-thousand-times-before. What saves this movie is the fact that it never got boring and pulls off some decent battle scenes. What it does so perfectly wrong in storytelling is also what makes it bearable because even if you are stupefied at how much Brett Ratner thinks you're stupid, you end up getting carried along by the whole ordeal of it and thanks to two or three crisp action scenes I wasn't disgusted by the movie as I thought I would have been or how I was with something like Transformers 4. The film still suffers from all of the above, very random direction, some very cheap, video game level Cgi in some parts of the movie and a bunch of idiotic elements such as fire buring stones (final act) and the whole centaur talk going on in the first two acts. ""Hercules"" fails in doing what its simple premise intended, but manages to offer some mild entertainment thanks to its lead, its cast and a couple of battles that manage to attract your attention to the screen for their duration.",Hercules

76,shawneofthedead,"A trademark big, dumb Brett Ratner movie that veers haphazardly between the sublime and the excruciating.",5,23 July 2014,"Brett Ratner makes big, dumb movies. Now, strictly speaking, there's nothing wrong with that. Not every movie has to win Oscars galore; some movies can exist solely to entertain. However, even with that caveat in mind, Ratner's track record isn't great. For every fun, silly entry in the ridiculous Rush Hour franchise, there's his bigger, dumber, altogether more reviled version of an X-Men movie to scrub off the CV. Hercules - a cheeky-yet-sombre reinvention of the Greek hero and myth - lodges itself somewhere between the two extremes. It's big and dumb, sure, and often in a hugely amusing way - but, at other times, it's actually impossible to ignore the film's frankly terrible plotting.The first inkling that this is not the Hercules you know comes in the form of Dwayne Johnson. Buffed to the max and sporting a skinned lion's head for a helmet, this ""hero"" is actually a mercenary for hire - wading into battle for the sake of monetary reward. It turns out that there's nothing all that demigod-like about the guy we all thought was the son of Zeus: his feats of great strength and endurance, known popularly as the Twelve Labours of Hercules, are merely stories, tall tales embellished to make him seem larger and more heroic than life itself. Instead, this version of Hercules roams Greece with his merry band of myth-makers: knife-thrower Autolycus (Rufus Sewell), Amazonian archer Atalanta (Ingrid Bolsø Berdal), storyteller nephew Iolaus (Reece Ritchie), berserker Tydeus (Aksel Hennie) and wry soothsayer Amphiaraus (Ian McShane).That's actually a pretty interesting premise - one that allows Ratner to have quite a bit of fun while he lays out the rather more serious bits of his plot. Indeed, Hercules is saved from its generally leaden story by the rich, sarcastic vein of humour that runs through it. We may have to be regaled by the twists and turns of Hercules' recruitment by Lord Cotys (John Hurt) to fend off the apparently supernatural enemy advances of rabble-rousing warlord Rhesus (Tobias Santelmann). But much of the joy of the film comes in its unapologetic bursts of comedy. Iolaus - effectively the troubadour of the piece - sings Hercules' praises in a thoroughly tongue-in-cheek manner, hawking leather armour while his uncle rolls his eyes. Tydeus barrels headlong into Hercules' precious shield-wall. Amphiaraus constantly awaits the fiery death he has foretold for himself. It's all quite happily ridiculous.The film is considerably less successful when its plot rears its ugly head and it moves into heavy-handed, dramatic territory. There's something intriguing about the politics in Thrace, particularly between Lord Cotys and his feisty daughter Ergenia (Rebecca Ferguson), but it's dwarfed by a host of competent but not hugely inspiring action sequences. This is also the kind of movie in which the villains don't kill the hero of the piece when they have the chance, just so the movie can keep on going. And keep on going it does, into a bizarre misfire of a final act that undoes a lot of its earlier, rather canny deconstruction of Hercules' myth.Johnson, always a winning presence, is effective but strangely under-used here. The kind of twinkle-eyed comedy the Rock has proved so good at is bypassed, sadly, in favour of plunging Hercules into a bitter battle with his inner demons. Hurt, too, is hamstrung by a role that's too solidly black-and-white - whatever the shade of Lord Cotys' morality. But the supporting players are clearly having a ball. McShane, in particular, practically waltzes through and away with the film, hitting his action beats as squarely and sublimely as he plays his distinctly hammy comedy.In summary: anyone hankering after a straight-laced re-telling of the Hercules myth will be disappointed. This is most emphatically not the film for them. To be fair, it's not quite the film for those who are looking for something a little edgier either. At some points, Ratner's film hits the mark: it cleverly peels away the layers of legend to reveal the person beneath - an uncommon man, but no anointed demigod. At others, its plot debunks itself into incoherence, and the melodrama of it all threatens to overwhelm the far better-judged moments of humour. The final result is a big, dumb movie that's undeniably entertaining, but falls short when it tries to be something more.",Hercules
77,jawneyfloros,the rock as Hercules,10,19 November 2018,Review: I loved this movie because it is a brand-new take on Hercules. Instead of focusing on just the myth or the legend of Hercules this movie focusing more on the concept of is Hercules a human or a god. The direction and screenplay are both incredible. The casting and acting are incredible also. Especially by the Rock as Hercules and Aksei Hennie as Tydus. The cinematography is absolutely incredible. The sets and costumes match the ancient Greek period which is also incredible. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.,Hercules
78,monstermayhem32,Great take on the legendary take,7,28 July 2014,"I would have to say that it was a rather risky move having Dwayne Johnson being cast as the legendary Hercules. However it seems as though the risk was well paid off since he manages to show the charm and strength that he brings to the character. However like the Hercules film that was released earlier this year with kellan lutz, this version seems to focus more on the men aspect compared to his god powers. However it does retain similar characters like his stepmother Hera and iaolus in which he is Hercules nephew rather than his friend like in the Hercules TV series that starred Kevin Sorbo. The plot of the film has Hercules and his mercenary group working with lord cotis played wonderfully by the legendary John hurt. However Hercules ends up getting betrayed and finding out who was the one responsible for his family's murder.",Hercules

He will flex his muscles, do incredible things, have some kick-butt fights, and stand up for good against evil. sounds like most of his movies, just a different time/era. The plot is that Hercules is not really a god, but goes around convincing people of his achievements by glorious storytelling, with his merry band of warriors, a la Robin Hood. He is hired by a rich guy to fight against some bad guys. Then he starts to question what is the truth here, and the plot thickens.Of course he had a beautiful wife, and brave companions. Lots of people get killed. that's what I expected, and was not let down.I liked this movie for pure entertainment and mindless good versus evil.

80,higherall7,The 'Truth' about Hercules...,7,23 January 2017,"I was galvanized by this movie! I remember the trailer. I was eagerly licking my chops in anticipation of viewing it soon. Unfortunately, life gets in the way, and it is only now that I can report finally viewing it in its entirety. Regardless of the liberties taken with the Mythos of the Son of Zeus, I thoroughly enjoyed this version of the Hercules tale.The beginning was great and called to mind the paintings done by the great Frank Frazetta for the Conan and Tarzan covers. The visual appeal of the opening sequence is so exhilarating that afterwards you are ready for the holes being inevitably poked into the fabric of the Hercules legend. This is for the adults, who, unlike children, cannot take things at face value and must bring logic and 'facts' into the fun. Compared to the graphic novel, by Steve Moore, the look and the feel of the film is a decided improvement. When Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson makes his first appearance in the opening scene wearing a lion's head as a helmet, he looks just like the character I read about in a children's book when I was seven years old. Face it, in Hollywood, looks are everything. This explains the enduring appeal of Lynda Carter's Wonder Woman. The fact that she actually looked like the comic book character come to life at times towered over such trivialities as character and plot development. Here Dwayne Johnson embodies the character in his own way much as did the late great Steve Reeves. You believe he is the real Hercules no matter what is said about him and his adventures.I remember watching 'ZENA: THE WARRIOR PRINCESS' and reading later in TV GUIDE how it took half a dozen ladies of similar appearance to Lucy Lawless to create the Warrior Princess myth. Lucy did all the acting; especially in the tight closeups; but there was an alternate Lucy for the swimming scenes, a Lucy for the jousting and sword fighting scenes, even a Lucy for the bareback riding and crucifixion scenes. The point being it took a whole team of people to create the legend of 'ZENA: THE WARRIOR PRINCESS'! This is the point with this version of 'Hercules', I believe. Here we have a warrior of unusual strength who goes around with his own myth-making machine. The sundry details of his labors and adventures are dubious and moot. But the hyperbolic way in which he is 'presented' to his 'public' is Hollywood merchandising mocking itself with a knowing wink. This is a Hollywood Hercules before there even was a Hollywood; and as Kirk Douglas used to chide John Wayne, yes, it may be true that he did not really kill all those Indians, but still, he sure packs a hell of a wallop in a bar fight.Let me not mislead you. I'm not writing this to convince you there is something profound or philosophical going on here in this movie. Quite the contrary. What I do like about it is the light play between fact and public relations. We are told at the end of the story that this is the 'truth' about Hercules. But you get the feeling that even this is to be taken with a grain of salt, because somebody may be carefully parking their tongue in their cheek for popcorn and ticket sales.",Hercules
81,Bruce722,Plagued with an identity crisis but still watchable.,5,23 February 2015,"Brett Ratner's Hercules film struggles with a bit of an identity crisis. On the one hand, I really like what Ratner tried to do in making the myth and lore of Hercules just that; myth and lore. He made the character simply a fantastic warrior and eventual mercenary who, along with the help of his comrades, played into the living legend in order to acquire jobs and terrify his enemies. I mean, who would want to go toe-to-toe with the mighty Hercules? The problem with the film is that Ratner doesn't leave the fantastical at the door as he should've. On the one hand, he portrays Hercules as a mortal and mocks the existence of hydra, centaurs, and cerberus. On the other hand he includes a psychic who can see visions of the future and he has Dwayne Johnson's Hercules perform superhuman feats that no mere mortal could do. Many of the action and battles sequences also fail here, with Hercules leveling many a foe with a single swing of his club. This identity crisis doesn't ruin the viewing experience completely but it does hinder the film's ability to create serious drama or intrigue. This film ultimately feels a bit shallow and the underutilization of Irina Shayk might be the biggest disappointment of the entire movie. She seemed to get half of the screen time in the trailers but gets maybe 30 seconds of screen time in the actual film. That's called poor representation. Overall, it's a decent watch and one of the better live action Hercules films I've seen but it fails to live up to its potential, largely due to poor direction.",Hercules

This is just 'blah' and tries to come off as a serious movie. Now that wouldn't be SO bad but somehow it shines HUGE light on Mr The Rock and his ability to really only play, well, himself? He actually comes across as a bad actor in this and you really do sit there and realize ""Hey, hes the same in every movie"". Now, i am a Rock fan so its hard for me to admit that this film was rather poo. Its a fun film to sit down with fellow movie buffs to make fun of and maybe create some fun drinking games over but this film left me feeling quite sad as it had such huge potential.Note: If you're making a Herculese who isn't half god then he should NOT be able to throw a F@%*ing horse!

83,faithless4734,Mediocrity,5,29 July 2014,"This film and the concept of the storyline had fantastic potential. Sadly the director and the writer and the producer all failed horribly. The battles were poorly designed and executed, the worst was the battle against Rhesus, he was allegedly waging this incredible campiagn thru Greece and then he faces Hercules and suddenly his army turns into nothing more than individuals charging into a wall of spears. The horse charge at the start of the battle is stopped without breaking the shield wall at all and all the calvary are suddenly and mysteriously gone including any dead horse. The shield wall is shown multiple times and there are almost no bodies in front of it but we are to believe that they are stunningly victorius and completely destroy the 'enemy'? The final battle against the true evil king, Lord Cotys, has Hercules and his companions knocking over 'bowls' that anyone can see are filled with burning charcoal. These then catch the stairs completely on fire pouring down the staircase like molten lava. Finally Hercules topples a statue of Hera to break the armies attack and the head roles down the stair a hits Lord Cotys knocking him of the side of a cliff. sadly in all previous scenes there was no cliff anywhere near him. The next wide pan shows a giant hole in the courtyard that was not their before and is not explained at all and is apparently the spot Lord Cotys fell into.How disappointing.",Hercules

This film is a billion times better than The Legend of Hercules released at the beginning of the year; and that I did not even bother to review. Hercules is directed by Brett Ratner and starred Dwayne-The Rock-Johnson in the main role. This is probably not the best movie of the year. However director Brett Ratner could make good looking movie and The Rock is awesome. I like him in everything he does and this movie reminds me of The Scorpion King (2002) which is one of his best movie ever. I'm surprised to say that this film is not as bad as I thought it will be. It's not a super great movie but it's not awful as well. The Rock is good as Hercules, he's big, strong, likable and good at action and kicking asses. Indeed there are some impressive battle sequences which were handled pretty well. The major drawback of this film is that we are waiting for the big twist till it's only 20-25 minutes left on the film. The big turn didn't happened soon enough unfortunately. Beside this aspect I wasn't really expecting more of this movie and may be that's the problem. Overall Hercules is a bit better than I thought and a LOT better than what happened in this other Legend of Hercules movie of January.",Hercules

86,bastille-852-731547,A Fun Summer Popcorn Movie,7,29 July 2014,"Honestly, when I heard about Dwayne Johnson playing Hercules, I wasn't sure what to expect. I had mixed feelings about the role, although since Johnson is so macho and strong, he would be a better choice than many. I also had mixed feelings about the plot--I was worried that it would be too formulaic and stick to the ""12 Labors"" plot, as there was already a movie released in January entitled ""The Legend of Hercules."" But while it's not perfect, this ""Hercules"" gets much more right than wrong. Instead of a reheated storyline from other Hercules movies, this one tells the ""untold story"" and discusses what life was like for Hercules after the well-known ""12 Labors"" (which are shown very briefly in a prologue) myth. The main plot is that Hercules trains and leads the Thracian army into battle. While the movie's main focus is the action, there are also a few humorous moments which breaks things up a little bit.Still, the villainous characters in ""Hercules"" are fairly undeveloped, and some of the content (the three-headed Hydra) is a bit repetitive. But the action and original story make this movie fun and enjoyable as long as you keep your expectations in check. Worth seeing at a matinée.",Hercules

I can't really say much else, but it's mainly about the war and him becoming a hero inside and things.-As a film goes is was good, but not that good. The story wasn't bad as far as cliché stories go. It did take a look at Hercules as a man and even went as far as to say it doesn't matter if he was half-god or not, it just mattered who he was. I liked that.-The acting was okay. The Rock wasn't great, but he looked like he really cared about the roll and he did his best. Everybody else was forgettable.-The tone and pace were fine. The film is predictable, and has a lot of genericness. There were a few moments that were surprising, but at one point, one of the friends actually leaves after the grand stick-with-me speech. I was like ""Cool, I hope he stays gone, because that would be so cliché!"" Aaaaand he came back.-The effects has some eh moments and some cool moments.-The music was cheesy. Not bad, but not fitting.-It's PG-13 and has violence, some language, which surprised me, and some brief partial nudity. Nothing is too bad.-As a whole, it's pretty generic, but entertaining. I would not give it more than a 6.5/10 though. I will say it's worth watching on Netflix/Redbox though!",Hercules
88,deacon_blues-3,Demythologized--but not too much,7,11 August 2015,"Dwayne Johnson makes all the FX believable! Just looking at his massive physique, you are not really surprised that he can flip an oncoming battle steed, flatten 5 adversaries with one blow from his club, or even topple an enormous statue of his ""step mom"" Hera from her pedestal. The characters in his cadre of mercenaries are all likable enough; Ian McShane as the visionary, Amphiaraus; Rufus Sewell as Herc's Spartan BFF, Autolycus ; Aksel Hennie as the ambiguous and taciturn Tydeus; Ingrid Berdal as the chaste but alluring amazon, Atalanta; and Reece Ritchie as Herc's verbose nephew, Iolaus.

89,craig-hopton,Boring movie with thrilling finale,5,20 April 2015,"This movie was a real disappointment. The concept isn't bad - Hercules is a normal man and the myth of his godlike feats has simply been exaggerated to sustain his legend.The problem is that Hercules's feats (the Labours of Hercules) are exactly what would make for a good cinematic spectacle - killing the Nemean Lion, capturing the Erymanthian Boar, etc. By skipping past them we end up watching a simple historical military campaign, and not a very interesting one at that.Then there's another problem - the acting. Dwayne Johnson has the physique to be Hercules, but his face seems to be incapable of mustering more than a single expression. Ingrid Berdal looks perpetually embarrassed to be cast as a scantily clad warrior. Even John Hurt is unconvincing as the backstabbing king.But then...... comes the finale!In the last thirty minutes, this movie springs brilliantly to life. It's an exciting, thrilling, superhero- esque dénouement that almost, almost rescues the movie from oblivion. If only the rest of the movie had been made in this vein.But as it is, all round, Hercules classes as a mediocre affair.",Hercules

Okay, they might have filled the cookie cutter stereotypes but I liked how they were all faithful and loyal to him and they didn't pull the old 'one of them resented his leadership and plotted against him' routine.The action scenes were really well done, particularly the battle in the village with the green berserkers, with each character getting some cool moves and the fighting was crunching and violent.I also enjoyed the novel twist on him being a mortal and that his reputation was bigger than he was.Good fun and well worth the admission fee.",Hercules

92,gerry_barnaby,"Outstanding Film, Tells the true story behind the legend that is Hercules",10,25 July 2014,"I've got to say this is the best version of Hercules I've seen in a long time, Dwayne Johnson really done this iconic character justice by bring the legend & the myth behind the man himself it was epic. The battle choreograph in this film is outstanding with some of the best stunts I've seen, it really show the true strength of Hercules which is why some people believe him as a demi god because of the sheer strength. Most of the film is a mixture of mythology & the real legend that is Hercules which is brilliantly told in a way you can easily understand not once did it show unrealistic theme. Like most legends are told by the deeds they do in real life, most legends come from real events, in history this perfect show the legends like Cerberus with the three heads showing the real life legend in the film which is brilliant done. Ian McShane play the Amphiaraus who can see the future if the god so wish to let him, he play this role with a funny sarcastic humour but a warrior that cant fight, he bring a very light humour to the role, Aksel Hennie play Tydeus who seem to be haunted by a battle years ago as a child from seeing what he seen, it made him a little animistic but a fierce fighter none the less, The gorgeous Ingrid Bolsø Berdal play Atalanta a Amazon warrior skilled with a bow & can fight like any man alive, she was awesome on the battle field, it was like watch a female version of Legolas from Lord of the rings, brilliant acting as a heroine for the story. Reece Ritchie plays Iolaus, who try he best to spread the word of Hercules legend by every seem to think him a fool, but he just wants to be a warrior like Hercules, brilliant performance from him, John Hurt performance is spot on as Lord Cotys bring a ruthless & multiplexing personality as you think he the good guy but is hold something back, brilliant shown in this film. Joseph Fiennes is kind of a cameo playing King Eurystheus but he play this perfect, a lot of his past in this film involves Hercules dark past. Dwayne the rock Johnson wow just awesome as Hercules, though most of the film i could tell that he was in pain clear from the injury in the wrestle match he torn the tendents in he pelvis, he was hiding it well but you could see the way he was walk he was in pain but still carry's on, but its just the way he portray this character is just outstanding performance i don't think they could of got a better actor to play the role to do it justice.Rufus Sewell playing Autolycus, brilliant acting playing character with a skill for knife throwing which matched his character perfect. The C.G.I effect are awesome special with the hydra in the swamp, perfect environment that portray the mythical breast perfect, the way the show Cerberus as well is outstanding perfect look for a hell hound gate keeper with three heads. This couple with visual effects,stunts & amazing choreograph fight scenes this is a outstanding film for Dwayne to be in, this is a film i recommend watch, i know a lot of people think Dwayne Johnson cant act but this film proves just has brilliant of an actor he is.",Hercules
93,vistheindian,"The Rock, the only solid foundation",6,4 August 2014,"Quickie Review:Hercules (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) has finished the twelve labors and risen to the legendary status of a Greek demi god. Now as mercenary for hire, the King of Thrace calls upon him and his team to defeat the threat of a warlord. Dwayne Johnson is a fan favorite and one of the most likable actors in Hollywood. Just watching him embody this legendary character makes for some entertaining moments of action and humor. It's no surprise however that apart from the lead actor this is quite a shallow experience, and the little depth that is given is handled poorly. Even if you are just watching for the action, that aspect was lackluster as well.Full Review:The recent sword-and-sandal movies from Hollywood have been mediocre at best, and absolutely horrendous at worst. So only one thing kept my hopes up for Hercules and that is Dwayne Johnson. So as I expected I was not impressed with the movie, but it was not an entire failure.As I have mentioned several times already Johnson saved Hercules. If it weren't for him, I assure you that this would've been just another generic entry in the genre. Just look at the pictures from the movie. Good lord, he is the closest thing to a demi-god we have ever seen in cinema (at least in recent memory). The charisma that he brings on screen just grabs your attention, from the threatening stare down to the wide friendly smile to a child. Yes, I might be man-crushing out right now, and if you have never done that before then you are lying sir or m'aam! The other cast members, although lack any depth were at least likable. Each of them were relevant to the story, and deliver some quirky funny lines from time to time.What surprised me the most is how misleading the trailers were. From all the footage shown, it seemed like this was going to have some epic scale fight scenes mixed with some fantastical creatures. That is far from the truth, because you learn early on that the mythology behind Hercules is just that, they are myths. Hercules and his gang just use these stories to build their reputation and strike fear in their enemies. So if you are looking to watch a fantasy oriented film, you'll be sorely disappointed.The story also leaves something to be desired. Of course I understand this is not the type of movie that should be taken seriously. I actually wouldn't have cared for the quality of the story, but the fact is that they did try to make a more serious plot with some back story that was supposed to deepen some inner conflict for Hercules. This back story only has any significance in the last 15mins of the movie. So they should've just let go with this unnecessary convoluted back story mess and just stick with a simple fun story.Hercules, in the end is nothing special. It's a good time killer, so I'd recommend just waiting till it comes out on Blu-ray and DVD to give it watch.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Hercules
94,CowherPowerForever,I Am Hercules!!!!,7,27 July 2014,"As we near the end of July 2014 we have a fairly good mindless action film, directed by the often criticized Brett Ratner. While the story is light and doesn't hold up that well, the action is downright fun from start to finish, and Dwayne Johnson(The Rock) gives a very good performance as the son of Zeus. This is my review of Hercules.The film was written by Evan Spiliotopoulos(who hasn't wrote anything since 2009 and his last effort was Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure, a children's animated film) and Ryan Condal(who is new on the scene only having written a short film and a TV movie called The Sixth gun). While on paper it would be easy to assume that these two guys would have a hard time adapting the comic that was made by Steve Moore, but this film actually felt and moved by very well. Well I can't speak of the content of the source material that Steve Moore wrote, I generally feel the story Spiliotopoulos and Condal wrote was passable. Now, with a film like this you aren't going to get any award nomination besides maybe a Razzie, but the story pieces together the action, with a passable plot twist that most will see coming. Overall, their efforts aren't great by any definition, but they do an okay job with all these great characters and setting up some good backstory for the fight scenes.The film is directed by Brett Ratner, whom a lot of people have a problem with, but I personally don't mind as he delivers what he always has, and that is mindless fun for ninety minutes to an hour. If you ever expect an Oscar directed film by Ratner then you are setting yourself up for a giant letdown before you even walk into the theater. Ratner's last big movie was Tower Heist, which was basically a comedy with some action scenes here and there. His last major action film was Rush Hour 3 way back in 2007, so it was a joy in my opinion to see him back directing a bigger action film. Ratner really brings out the strong action scenes and even acting from actors like Dwayne Johnson(The Rock) and Ian McShane, as well as nice performances from John Hurt and Rufus Sewell. While I wouldn't call the acting amazing in this film, the actors generally gel nicely which adds a nice little depth to the film. The action in this film is what most will go see this film for. Ratner knows how to direct a nice action scene, but some of the CG heavy scenes look kind of silly, but in this type of film, I think that actually helps it out. While there are only a few action scenes, they do last a considerable amount of time, and with a rather short ninety three minute runtime(without credits) that is a good chunk of the film. So, in my book Ratner gets a big thumps up for his effort in this film, as does the cast lead by The Rock.Overall, if you really want a fun popcorn flick to watch one weekend, this is easily the film for you. With little in the way of a story, the action pushes all that doubt away, and makes for a truly wonderful film for most of us to enjoy. The question most will have now is whether or not the 3D is worth it. I watched the movie in IMAX 3D, and while not a lot pops out at the screen, it adds some nice depth, and when things do pop out at the screen it looks amazing. The IMAX is always an added bonus as it brings a giant screen and top of the line sound. So, not only is the film worth watching, I would say the IMAX 3D is also worth it if you are into that type of gimmick.7/10",Hercules
95,ahegde3149,A roller coaster ride but a bad one.,4,13 November 2014,"I don't know how many Hercules based movies are made till date in Hollywood,have seen only this year's 'Legend of Hercules' which was horrible. While this one is a definitely a huge improvement over 'Legend of Hercules' but still it's far from a good film. Now I don't know much about the mythology involving Hercules, I only know he is demi-god who performed some impossible feats. But this movie is nothing about the myth of Hercules, in fact it addresses that Hercules is not just a myth.So we are introduced to Hercules in first 20 minutes of the film, get to know he performed 12 labors involving defeating monstrous creatures. Its told quite blandly though. Hercules has some 4-5 companions who specialize in war and work with him and are almost like family.Among them is a guy who doesn't know to speak(behaves quite an like an animal) whose character was quite interesting.Then suddenly our hero accepts an offer from some king called 'Cotys' to help him in war to defeat some mysterious enemy called rhesus whose army has ability to become centaurs(half-man half-horse). And our hero is going to be the savior. Its frankly quite boring in first hour unless there is some war action.Also there is some mystery induced regarding the family of Hercules. After that again the film dips only to revived by a twisty climax. There is also a moment where our savior says 'I am Hercules!!!!' which definitely made go 'yeah.. go beat them up' waking me up at the right time.The last 20 minutes of the movie balance the equations somewhat. So its like a roller coaster ride.Dwayne Johnson's looks rock solid as Hercules with his pumped up body, acting nothing memorable though he just plays it up to the mark. The lion's skin on his head and the club in his hand really add to his awesome physique, that's how Hercules should look like.Another nice performance is that of the quite animal guy I talked about(don't know his name). Apart from that nothing great about the performances. The movie is visually good but nothing great in writing department, well what else do you expect from such action oriented movies. I would say it was on par with this years '300:Rise of Empire', fans of such action movies can give it a chance rest I believe should not be interested.RATING:[2/5]",Hercules

I mean, after all the hype, month after month of promotion, Hercules this and Hercules that....this.... this is what we get? As I sat there in the cinema, letting this film rape my eyes, I began to question myself and really give myself an internal telling off. I have this irritating inability to just walk out of the screening during a film. No matter how horrific the film is, my backside just appears to be glued to the seat. Not only was i upset with my lack of assertiveness, but I also lost faith in my fellow man. Whilst I was gradually chewing my face off, I couldn't help but notice a few people who where clearly enjoying the film. Laughing at material that was no funnier than a violent case of diarrhea (yes i know, ironic, because this film is just that). I mean it was bad.....really bad, not funny whatsoever. It was painfully predictable. And these people where...laughing. Why? Was it a case of ""if you don't laugh, you'll cry""? I sure hope so, for the sake of humanity. Every single character in this film, was diabolical. And collectively they create a time wasting tragedy. The direction was paralytic. Even the action is criminal . In the trailer, they show Hercules battle mythological beasts and I in no way want to spoil anything, but be prepared to see 90% of those ""battles"" in the first 5 minutes...i do not jest. It is false advertising at its finest. And as those 5 minutes disappear into obscurity, all you are left with is ""The Great One"".... Dwayne Johnson try his damnedest to stop his strong American accent from taking over...which he fails to do...every 2nd or 3rd line. But hey, casting wouldn't be about finding someone who can actually do the accent, or someone who can act, or someone who isn't cocooned in cheese. It's all about those muscles. Plain and Simple. Dwayne Johnson is an average actor, he was great in ""Pain and Gain"", but for this role? This was a case of biting off more than you can chew. And ironically enough ""The Rock"" acted like stone.I must also add that if I where as shallow as this film, i could have easily used this as a way to terminate my long term relationship with my girlfriend. As prior to going to see it, our options where ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" or ""Hercules"", and my girlfriend chose this. Looking back that choice was like either having a 5 star meal or eating my own feces. So there you go, this film has the capability of possibly ruining lives. If you want to see a film about the legend of Hercules, there is a perfectly good Disney film that caters to the legend and doesn't try to re-write or re-analyze it. And I can't believe these words are being typed by my fingers.....but...there is also a Hercules film that was recently made called...""Legend of Hercules"" starring future Oscar winner Kellan Lutz.... and in a previous review, I trampled all over it and actually typed Dwayne must be shaking in his boots, well in hindsight he should have been, because yes people, Kellan Lutz played Hercules better than Dwayne Johnson and that....that is probably the BIGGEST insult I could ever give anyone...",Hercules

Frankly, both movies are terrible.Although he looks magnificent, the lead actor's delivery is poor, even for a notorious B-movie star like The Rock.The film includes an Amazon woman in Hercules' posse in order to lure female moviegoers, but still manages to be sexist. The plot is utterly common and predictable. Dumbed-down jokes attempt to break up the tedium. The only bright spot in this film are the two supporting actors who incidentally worked together in Starz' excellent ""Pillars of the Earth"" series.In fairness, this film isn't worse than a 1950s B-movie sci-fi or sword-and-sandals film.

100,YJLcool,A decent realistic take on the legend of Hercules,7,28 July 2014,"In many ways, Hercules caught me by surprise. The film's unexpected take on the legend of Hercules might not appeal with certain audience groups. Basically, the film tries to tell us that the legend is not what it seems to be...it was fabricated to make people fear or respect the titular hero instead.The story takes place years after Hercules' 'legendary twelve labors' and the death of his wife Megara and their children. Hercules works as the leader of a group of mercenaries - knife-throwing thief Autolycus, the Amazon archer Atalanta, the spear-wielding seer/fortune teller Amphiaraus, the fearless, bestial warrior Tydeus and the storyteller, Iolaus, who is also Hercules' nephew. They're all loyal to Hercules. Hercules tries to save up enough gold so he could retreat and get a quiet peaceful life by the ocean. The group was hired by Lord Cotys of Thrace to assist him in defeating a powerful warlord who's into the dark arts and has a strong army of centaurs by his side. As the film progresses, we soon realize that things are not what it seems to be.The story is quite straightforward with some slight twists to the legend. Each of the characters in the film has a distinctive personality, they were given slight backstories and screen time for the audience to know them. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson imbues his character with just enough charm and charisma to convince the audience that he fits the role perfectly. His enormous physique shows his dedication to the role and he sure looks like the legend. The film placed our legendary hero quite firmly in reality. But, Hercules does live up to his name and legend when the film gets to its third act. The battle scenes are well-choreographed and the battle formation strategies are both exciting and thrilling. The Thracian army training by Hercules and his group of mercenaries was quite enjoyable as well. There's also some occasional funny moments in the film which provides some unexpected laughs for the audience along the way. Overall, the film is a successful realistic take on Hercules. The film does deliver an acceptable action spectacle and feels fun and entertaining despite the absence of fantasy elements that usually comes with the legend.",Hercules
101,moviescoundrel,Not So Mighty,6,30 July 2014,"Dear Brett Ratner....do better. You're capable of making a decent movie, and then you make movies like this. This could have been a complete failure, or better than average, but instead it falls pretty much right in the middle. I guess it's kind of like an origin story, except without much origin, or good explanation. Hercules (Johnson) in this film, may or may not be the demi god son of Zeus, and other than being ripped and strong, nothing too special is present. He has a decent band of helpers. It felt much like the ""King Arthur"" reboot with Clive Owen some years back, nothing that special about Arthur/Hercules, but they did some okay things, and they had a band of loyal comrades. Hercules goes around and swings his club at some things, but he's not that special. Then he agrees to help a king and train some soldiers. So kind of like Braveheart, except without the leader's charisma, the plots details, and anything else good that could happen. The story is lame as well for the most part. In fact until about halfway through I was moderately bored and uninspired. Then a decent sized battle occurs, Hercules throws some guy and a horse through the air, and says ""F#$%ing Centaurs."" There are some centaurs in this battle, not many it seems, and he doesn't throw one, he just says it. Weird Ratner, weird. Almost as weird when in ""X- Men: Last Stand"" one of the antagonists toward the end calls someone a ""bitch"" just to get the word in their it seems. Weird. Anyway, the movie does get better at this point, and there is a surprise or two, some humor, and a tad of character development. Not enough to salvage it totally from mediocrity, but better than letting it fall way below.",Hercules
102,liam_nb,This movie doesn't deserve any hate for being bad cos it was never gonna be good,8,8 May 2020,"I look at this in the same way I'd look at any movie with the rock in like fast and furious or that GI Joe sequel when it's that type of dumb action movie that has little to no story and just a load of good action with some charismatic actors to hold attention when not stabbing people, so sit back enjoy dumb action for under 2 hours.
When I first saw this movie I didn't particularly appreciate this cos of Lord of the rings mostly the specifics on why I didn't like it was the lack of mythology which was a bit lame but on a second viewing I can just enjoy dumb action and you can too, also the big battles are really well made considering not Helms Deep quality but still good and worth a watch.",Hercules
103,Filmreader,Boring Dwayne,1,17 October 2021,Play Dwayne Johnson. That is enough for me to make it a boring movie. But generally any film with Dwayne is boring for me. If was other actor maybe I would change my rating.,Hercules
104,stephenlovelette,A great PG-13 for those willing to buy in.,9,30 July 2014,"I cried.Go ahead. Laugh it up.Greek minstrels sang tales of his twelve labors. Roman historians like Tacitus and Plutarch inked record of his deeds.Most recently he was the protagonist of the 1997 Disney animated feature. Which is good, but on the lower end of the classic spectrum.The demi-god makes a cameo in Homer's Odyssey, for Pete's sake!My point being: We're due for another dose.This weekend Hercules lost in the box office to Lucy, despite a superior score on Rotten Tomatoes.Lucy pulled in almost $44M, earning back its $40M budget. It's now at 58%, certifiably rotten and deservedly so. My displeasure with Lucy's deceptive trailer has increased considerably since reviewing it.Starkly contrasting the experience with Hercules, which made only $30M and cost $100M. It now clings to 'Fresh' status with 62%.Based on a Radical Comics series ""Hercules"" by Steve Moore, director Brett Ratner offers a revisionist take on the classic tale.A recent trend in PG-13 is to parade the rating throughout. Two summer blockbusters are guilty of this: Godzilla and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. DotPotA is particularly at fault for feeling like a franchise vehicle.IMDb and Rotten 'Matoes should include another statistic: Number of submissions to the ratings board.Hercules has admirably high stakes. If one's looking, there are moments you can pinpoint when the footage is cut to 'earn' the stamp of approval. Either way, I'm nearly certain this one pushes the limit. The battles feel real and characters die on-screen.In order to acquire a PG-13 rating, one of the criteria limits the number of 'F-Bombs'. If the curse word is uttered more than once, the movie can't be released with anything less than an 'R.'Like last year's All is Lost, Hercules puts its one 'fuck' to good use.Perusing various reviews, one quickly recognizes the vitriol toward Ratner. One critical reviewer mentions how the director, 'nearly ruined Hannibal Lector and the X-Men.'Hannibal, really? Who cares?In regards to the X-Men, we can agree he made mistakes.I don't believe his goal was to lessen their integrity, and try to avoid schlepping hurt feelings between franchises.Speaking of which, I'd much prefer a sequel to Hercules in exchange for the next Apes flick.Fans of that series need to settle down. The Apes movies are cool, okay? Can we please move on?Anywho.What really makes Herc shine is the casting.Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is perfect for the role.In Roman mosaics Hercules's image is shown tanned bronze for symbolic reasons. The same goes for the Etruscans who cast his deeds onto bronze mirrors.Therefore Dwayne's skin tone is appropriately dark - on a symbolic level as well.Plus he's an excellent actor. He's charismatic and lovable. Some might associate him with the 'good guy' role, when he's nailed it as the antagonist twice: In Doom as the corrupted honorable leader, and in Get Smart as a charming double agent.More importantly, he's prolific.Most importantly, he never mails it in.For that we thank him. Good on ya D.J.The value of Ratner's version is bolstered largely by the supporting cast.Ingrid Bolso Berdal is a Norwegian actress and plays the orphaned Amazon, Atalanta.Her badass bow-slinging performance is worthy of esteem. Warrior women are always physical roles, and I think directors hesitate to craft intricate female fight sequences.The majority of the credit's due to Ingrid's acting, however. Not many could pull off Atalanta, and most wouldn't be brave enough to take it in the first place.Especially considering the two-piece armor she wears in every scene.Before quibbling, someone should compare the percentages of bare skin between Ingrid and Dwayne. I can almost guarantee he's more naked.To the point: Hopefully Ingrid pops up more often.The movie opens and closes with Ian McShane doing voice-over as Amphiaraus. You might recognize him from the HBO series Deadwood, in which he plays one of the greatest sympathetic villains ever. Or his more recent role in 2012's Snow White and the Huntsman.McShane's terrific regardless, and his character is reminiscent of Vitruvius, the unreliable prophet (voiced by Morgan Freeman) in The Lego Movie.Rufus Sewell plays Autolycus, and delivers a performance in which he must navigate some clichés. He's a tremendous actor, because he quietly softens their impact.You may recognize him as the lead role in a great movie: John Murdoch from 1998's Dark City.As a final note, Hercules ends with one of the best credits sequences released this year. It's noteworthy because it's brilliantly animated, and contributes to the narrative.If you haven't seen Ratner's revisionist take, I'd suggest catching it in IMAX 3D. People love to hate on the new movie-going experience.It's bigger. From a technical standpoint it's better.Try not worry about the price to visual improvement ratio when you can be enjoying the film.All in all, in a summer sea of PG-13, Hercules is a cut above the rest.With its riveting story, a strong cast of diverse characters and plenty of fighting to go around, something's bound to catch your eye.",Hercules
105,andreascaloni,FUN AND ENJOYABLE RIDE,6,1 March 2021,"Dwayne Johnson plays the classical hero, leading a squad of mercenaries to defend the king of Thrace. An entertaining action flick, Hercules offers a fun and enjoyable ride, retelling the story of the legendary character and his heroics. But the climax could've been better and the battles scenes aren't epic. Nevertheless the film with its sprinkling of tongue-in-cheek lines makes the 98 minutes a fun watch.Rating: 6,5.",Hercules
106,Tyson14,Good entertainment with something to say about the sons of god,8,31 July 2014,"If this had been headlined by anyone other than Dwayne Johnson then I'm not sure I'd have turned up at the cinema. Even then it was a bit touch and go. What could this sword and sandals flick offer that wasn't already covered by many others the last fifteen years? It turns out Hercules is pretty unique in its attempt to say something important about the world we live in, layered beneath the many coloured imagination of director Brett Ratner and the needs of a PG12 rating.Hercules is one of the great legends of ancient Greece, the half human son of Zeus. The slayer of mighty beasts and a single man able to face down whole armies. Or so the legend says.It has been three years since Hercules was banished from Athens for the alleged murder of his wife and children. He now roams the lands around the Aegean sea, a mercenary for hire, along with his small band of loyal soldiers. When a beautiful princess asks Hercules to save her father's once proud kingdom from marauding centaurs, the offer of payment in gold to Hercules weight is too good to refuse. As Hercules trains the rag tag army of this beleaguered nation and leads them to battle, Hercules and his men realise not all is it what it seems. When Hercules's past turns around and confronts him face on he has to also face the reality of his own legend.Despite an often flat first half carried on the very broad shoulders of our man Dwayne, we realise at the mid-point a quite interesting premise has been played and the second half is quite something. Dwayne is always charismatic if not possessed of the ease Rufus Sewell and Ian McShane have in front of camera, both of which almost steal the show. Hercules small band of warriors work well together although Ian McShane in particular has all the best lines and moments, memorably towards the end.Ultimately this is very watchable, a good way to spend a few hours on a Friday night. It has a very worthwhile message, is underpinned by great actors and is clever, at least in the second half. But there is something missing. This is a PG12, which means for all the violence, of which there is a lot, there is nothing to ground it as real violence. Hercules has heart but it's a long way short of Conan (1982) and a league apart from Gladiator (2000). By giving it such an unrealistic context, violence without reality, to achieve a younger audience it detracts from the core message, so painstakingly woven through the story.Hercules is good entertainment with something important to say if you're willing to overlook a few shortcomings, mostly around catering for a younger audience.",Hercules
107,kuuk3,"Gets better after 20 minutes, tries to be different",6,30 July 2014,"Firstly, the film has a slow start. We see almost motion comic footage of Hercules doing his 12 labours in slideshow form, with Hercules face hidden in silhouette. So I felt a little cheated. Then we have a scene which tries to set up what makes this version of the main character different than any other version we have seen before. I wont give it away, as its basically what the film is about. But it tries to play with our knowledge of him. It doesn't ignore the back story of his wife and kids, but glosses over those parts until it becomes necessary to divulge that information. Again, i think it would have been better to see it, rather than be told what happened. I knew his history and so was wondering if they would portray this properly. Instead they do something to set-up a villain for the end which I wont give away. Just know that they do tie up all lose ends as needed, but a prior knowledge of who this character is and what he has done does help the viewer understand his motivations and his life up to this point.Its when the big war starts that you really sit up and start paying attention. Somehow watching the Rock talk doesn't interest you, but when the fighting starts with the epic 200 people battle sequences, you suddenly see where the budget went, the fights are fantastic!What is really great is how Hercules and his band of merry men (and woman) use smarts to outwit the enemy rather than simply use strength each time. That was clever. From the moment of that first fight the film moves up a notch and becomes excellent entertainment. Its a historical film and tries to be serious about its overall message. Dwayne does a good job but he's not going to win any awards for this. The other cast members actions are predictable and sufficient. But don't really add much to the plot. They could have been written out and it would have changed nothing. The running length is long enough to feel satisfied and not so long that it overstays its welcome. The plot twists you see coming a mile away but at least it tries to do them. Other than one characters actions near the end which was so obvious it was stupid to include.In conclusion, its worth watching. It takes it times to grab you, but once it does it doesn't let go. There are a few stretches of how strong Hercules is, but not enough for you to hate it. The 3D has its moments, but like most films I would rather have watched it in 2D as I don't think it made a major difference and its more comfortable not having to wear those glasses with my head upright the entire time.",Hercules
108,MajorBaleegh,Hercules without special powers,6,3 October 2018,The film Hercules failed to deliver the audience the actual essence of Hercules character. He was half god as his father was Zeus and half human as his mother was a mortal woman. In the entire movie it wasn't shown anywhere that he uses the godly powers he possesses. He was shown injured and hurt like normal human do where as if you see the Hercules the legendry journeys in that tv series the Hercules was never hurt or got injured as he was half god. The audience lost the interest as he was shown as a normal human not as some super hero which was expected out of this character. Kevin Sorbo should have played the role as he looks like a Hercules and Dwayne was out of proportion for this role.,Hercules
109,Chiller7,"Pretty good, if you can forgive the false advertising",10,22 November 2015,"First viewing: I was disappointed, because I thought it'd be more of a fantasy movie. Second viewing: I got past the lack of fantasy elements and realized, hey, this is actually pretty enjoyable.The advertising, from the trailers to the movie posters, appeared to promise an epic fantasy action adventure, prominently featuring Hercules battling giant mythological monsters; but in the actual movie those monsters were barely seen at all. In fact, the few brief shots of the monsters that they show you the trailers are about as much as you get to see of them in the entire movie. This was clearly a case of false advertising, because most blatantly of all, one shot in the trailer shows a man swinging a whip that's brightly glowing like it's on fire - some sort of magical weapon perhaps? Nope, in the movie, that same whip was not on fire at all, just an ordinary whip. That's why the first time I watched this in the theater, I left feeling a bit disappointed by it.But I just watched it again and realized it was a lot better than my initial impression. Once you get past the lack of fantasy elements and accept that Hercules just fights a bunch of human enemies here, not gods or monsters, the movie's really not so bad. There's a lot to like here. Dwayne Johnson and his muscles fit the role of the strongest man in all of ancient mythology well. The action is enjoyable enough, especially the moments of Hercules showing off his ridiculous strength, knocking people off their horses with a simple swing of a club, kicking a wooden cart flying into the air like it was launched from a cannon, etc. Hercules's companions are a likable crew, even if we only get a bare-minimum amount of backstory on them. Even the corny humor was funny: ""If the skin of the Erymanthean Boar is indestructible, how did Hercules cut it off the boar?!""The scale of the movie is also smaller than you might expect. This is a self-contained little story in the life of Hercules, not his whole epic. Don't expect to see Hercules explore all of ancient Greece, because he instead spends the whole movie in the little kingdom of Thrace, and mainly in the king's castle and on a couple of battlefields. It's a simple story, but entertaining enough.",Hercules
110,j-madej,"""Hercules"" is technically well made with impressive battle scenes that bring to mind Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" in the scope and reality.",6,27 July 2014,"Many people laughed when Arnold Schwarzenegger set out for Hollywood and decided to become a movie star. His English had a thick Austrian accent and his face was not the ideal male handsome look of the time, but as bodybuilder he knew very well how to present his imposing physique. There was almost something charismatic yet intimidating about him. James Cameron once said that Arnold was the best actor he ever worked with, in terms of raw physical direction. Of course the emotional part left something to be desired and was a domain of his immediate competitor in Sylvester Stallone. This brings us to ""The Rock"" Dwayne Johnson 42 years old ex wrestler turn actor with booming Hollywood career. Dwayne like Arnold had an experience performing in front of the audience and knows how to present his physique. I really liked his performance in ""Pain & Gain"" as a role I felt was closer to him and his type of acting. Sometime comedic timing is the hardest to create but to him it comes easily. Yes, ""The Rock"" is very muscular here, but lacks the charisma and believability in his acting. I really think he is more fitted for comedic roles. Thankfully he had a strong supporting cast including Ian McShane (another good role after ""Cuban Fury "") and Rufus Sewell as well as always excellent John Hurt. There are some nice female characters that do not get as much screen time as we would like but then again this film is mainly expression of a male testosterone. Unfortunately what lacked in otherwise relatively solid movie was the believability of the lead, the ""Rock"" as the main hero. The idea is to show him as strong mortal men who's legend presided his potential. He has few trusted mercenaries who help him with his endeavors and initially he and is mates are a muscle for hire. As the story develops they need to find out if they have morals and if the serve the right cause. As the story goes:""Having endured his legendary twelve labors, Hercules, the Greek demigod, has his life as a sword- for-hire tested when the King of Thrace and his daughter seek his aid in defeating a tyrannical warlord.""""Hercules"" is technically well made with impressive battle scenes that bring to mind Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" in the scope and reality. Fighting choreography works very well on a big scope. Costume design (the lion skin on top of Dwayne's head) and the unnatural facial hair (beard that was clearly glued on him) created unwanted distraction and chuckles from the audience. I have to be honest I liked ""Hercules"" and was much more entertaining then I expected, due to the solid direction by Brett Ratner whom I've met at the Polish Film Festival back in 2011. Nice guy! Ratner in his directorial style has the ability to keep things light and comedic where the other directors would make things otherwise dark. He is set to direct ""Beverly Hills Cop 4"" and I think he might be suitable for that type of comedic-action style of movies. I just wish in ""Hercules"" he would have decided to be bit more realistic with keeping all the comedic accents, which are good tension relievers. But when Dwayne is giving last pep talk to his man, before the battle and you in the audience don't feel a thing, that's when you as the actor playing the part did not do your job well no matter how imposing physically you originally looked. I just felt that young Arnold form ""Conan the Barbarian"" would make a great Hercules here, though Johnson as Hercules might have better grasp of English then Schwarzenegger back in a day, in terms of presence and charisma, no contest. Where is a prime Arnold when you need him?!For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",Hercules
111,hypersonic8999,Pleasantly surprised,8,28 October 2014,"(very minor spoiler in the last paragraph) As a Greek who grew up on the myths of Hercules and general Greek mythology I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I was expecting a very skewed retelling of the 12 Deeds of Hercules, but instead the film does not center on those at all. Instead Hercules is a mercenary mortal who has built up quite a fierce reputation, along with his companions. If you are a fan of adventure, then this is a good film to watch. The acting is unexpectedly good (not the best, just average but still on the better side of the scale) and the story is interesting. There's little forced romance or drama. There's effort to make the setting look more like Ancient Greece than most films about Ancient Greece try to depict: for example the places are real, the names of the characters are more or less Greek (with very few latinized exceptions), the military tactics displayed are actual Ancient Greek tactics (specifically the Thebian phalanx that is employed by the Thracean army, as well as the Peloponessean square) and the few references to mythology, theology and geography are also solid. The maps displayed have proper Greek names on them.The story has a few twists and turns, but is put together nicely and although predictable and with a couple holes it serves the pacing and the action well.All in all, the creators made significant effort to make this film right and they succeeded for the most part.(minor spoiler warning) Towards the end in particular there's a very gripping scene where one of the characters is about to be executed and I found their performance to be the best for such a scenario that I have ever seen.",Hercules
112,Alise_shenle,Better Watch This than the Legend of Hercules,8,24 July 2014,"First of all, I didn't watch this movie in 3D, because it was not filmed in 3D, so I expected the 3D version to look dark and hard-to-see. Anyway, you all know the Rock is not well-known for his acting prowess, but luckily his Hercules did not take himself too seriously. Hercules is thus a funny and normal guy character. The supporting cast is full of people who look alike--the prophet like a stoned Iron Man; the Princess look like Keri Russell. The Rock also look believable, his body is exactly how you imagined Hercules to look, unlike Kellan Lutz who is entirely too pale and ""pudgy"". The plot is fairly straightforward. We're told from the start that this Hercules is mortal, so you will feel anxious about Hercules' life. This movie then follows the standard formula for Summer blockbusters: A special team (A Team, GI Joe etc) finds they were betrayed by the government (king) and then break into jail (prison) to clear their names. Expect lots of modern jargon and humour. Special mention to Atalanta who is like Legolas but prettier. Although sometimes Hercules do stupid things, in the end he redeems himself by performing some pretty smart moves, such as some modern weaponry and marketing interludes (not to mention some FBI-like training montages). In conclusion, the unpredictable, action-packed movie is family-friendly and there are no romantic scenes to slow down the pace.",Hercules
113,FallsDownz,"""Hercules is one of those movies that try to be new and try to be fresh but in the end it just fall in the same category that calls repetitive""",6,25 July 2014,"First i have to say that at first i thought this movie are going to be like bad or like meh but i'm pretty surprise , it's actually better than i thought it would be.With the story that pretty entertaining and interesting , it's like a Maleficent in that kind of story that instead of using the old story , they create a new one mixing it and it just makes this movie a lot more interesting than it should be and i kind of a love to see them trying to give us new stuff instead of using the same thing over and over again like we all kind of a expected in the first place, so if you expected Clash of Titans or Wrath of Titans in this movie you'll not get it for sure (which is good thing i guess?) .The casting are also really good in Hercules pretty much everyone is doing great like Dwayne Johnson aka. ""The Rock"" , Rufus Sewell , John Hurt , Aksel Hennie , Peter Mullan and my favorite Ian McShane still doing fantastic job in this movie. They all great in the movie and giving it so much light and heart BUT even that i have to say that a lot of stuff in this movie is really repetitive like characters or story that even they try to mixing it and make a new cool story one it just still repetitive and predictable .and another thing that just bugs my mind is Production Design that just looks pretty bad i mean if you saw the disaster Pompeii movie , it's kind of that bad buy Hercules may be a bit better.Overall this is a pretty decent but can be fun movie if you like the cast then go ahead and you probably not disappointed but don't go see it expecting to saw a lot of CG a lot of fighting like Wrath of Titans because you'll be disappoint for sure.",Hercules
114,CrisMovieCorner,"A mythology free Hercules, really?",4,30 November 2014,"Swords and sandals are not usually my thing I mean I haven't even seen ""Troy"" or ""Gladiator"", which for somebody who considers himself a cinephile is all kinds of wrong. So going into this I wasn't expecting much, main reason I watched it was I am a fan of The Rock he makes enjoyable films. Which half the time aren't actually well written or made films, he is just a great performer, has been since his days of wrestling. I tend to check out pretty much everything he does, a fair amount of the time I enjoy the films. for instance I enjoyed ""Pain & Gain"" and ""Snitch"" (may review them in the coming weeks).Brett Ratner is very much a hit and miss director in my opinion, he makes enjoyable stuff like the Rush Hour films, well at least two the third lacked the charm I found. Anyway back to Ratner, along with his good films he makes some awful choices like well the obviously bad ""X-Men: The Last Stand"". This time around Ratner has made a semi decent film, his use of CGI are good at times, however his dull visuals of mountains and expansive land are boring to look. He tries to replicate the scenes we see in the likes of the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, but this idea falls flat on its backside.Dwayne Johnson was a good casting to play Hercules, however he was not the best character in the film his entourage were more than steal scenes. His team of Rufus Sewell, Ingrid Bolsø Berdal, Ian McShane, Askel Hennie and Reece Ritchie were better characters than Hercules. There is moments when Ritchie's Lolaus completely changes the tone of the film, fits of laughter from some of his bullshit twists on the Hercules story. Plus Askel Hennie as Tydeus was brilliant, he doesn't speak much but his crazy antics are a nice change from the attempt at drama that isn't that intriguing most of the time.While the film is based on one the widest known Greek mythological stories, this film however is based on a comic book written by the late British comic writer Steve Moore. The film strips back the story we all have known for a long time and changes it more than anybody would expect; Hercules is NOT the son of Zeus, He did NOT undertake the labours like we know, while he does do the labours it turns out they were not mythological. In fact, in this incarnation the labours he performs were all against mortals like himself, They are two biggest changes I know of, I don't know the actual details of Hercules story just the very basics from growing up watching the animated show and Disney film. That being said I kind of felt cheated in the sense that I wanted to see some mythological based aspects to the film, not for the story to be completely rewritten into some crap twist on the story.With three big battle scenes there is a few fun parts to the film, not enough to warrant this film being considered as anything more than a pop corn flick if it even deserves that title. While these fight scenes are fun to watch, they do not make up for the shoddy story and boring drama that struggles to bring in your attention and keep it. Plus it also felt like they writers or even director didn't really know in which way to take, while Hercules in the film is a mortal, there is two scenes in which you would struggle to believe he is only human. In one scene he throws a horse with a man on its back and in another he pushes over a statue that towers in comparison to anything a man could move.Overall, the film was an okay nothing more than I expected from a Brett Ratner attempt at making something mythological. I have heard many people claim it is far superior to this years similar release of ""The Legend Of Hercules"" starring Kellan Lutz, if that film is of less quality than this I don't think I will ever watch it. Hercules while it could be considered a popcorn flick, I would advise looking elsewhere for a fix of swords and sandals, not that I personally can recommend any. However, there surely has to be better options than this, if there is not then I can't see how the subgenre has lasted so long. This may sound unorthodox, but I struggle to give this any more than 4 out of 10, that is a star for each battle and one extra star for the entourage as a whole other than those I can't find any other positives to add to the film.",Hercules
115,koen_smit,Very entertaining and well made movie.,8,8 August 2014,"My expectations of this movie were not so high. Why? Because I was expecting another Wrath of the Titans kind of mess with legends and monsters and some comedy with a bad storyline and focus on effects and not on storytelling. Luckily I was wrong. This is a very entertaining and well made movie. The scriptwriter did something smart: he took the legend of Hercules and his 12 chores and took the magical away by explaining what the monsters actually were and are. Obviously Hercules himself ís extremely strong and has the help of his friends to keep the legend alive. When he finds out he made a wrong choice he has to accept who he is.Dwayne Johnson is such a remarkable person. Every time he appears in a movie I still think beforehand, well let's see why they hired the Rock for this part. And every time I am surprised by his edginess, natural charm and acting skills. If it's action movie or comedy, he always delivers, maybe not Oscar-worthy but he does the job he was hired for. Here as well. You do believe his strength, he has several leader-speeches and delivers them with ease and conviction as if he has been doing this his whole life. His troubled soul regarding his family did get its place in his character development. Maybe that could have integrated a bit more in his character, but did I miss it? No. The rest of the movie is very well cast as well. No one is mediocre, everyone delivers what is needed and then some more. Especially Ian McShane, John Hurt and Rufus Sewell were once again a pleasure to watch. The script was well written, it's pace is good and there is no unnecessary scenes that have nothing to do with character development or storyline. The dialogues are strong and well- written. The twists in the story are believable and the typical Hollywood action movie- development is used in an organic way. In the trailer you do see some magical things happen, like the lightening whip. But in the movie this has made normal again, and that was a good choice.This all makes it an entertaining and well made movie, one I think I wouldn't mind watching again in some time.",Hercules
116,videodrome1234,Actually not bad,6,23 August 2014,"It's an interesting year in regards to the Hercules legend. 2014 sees 3 films about the Greek hero, though maybe its pushing it to call the Asylum beauty a film. At the beginning of the year The Legend of Hercules came out, which is jockeying for the position of worst film of the year. It was bloody horrible. But now we didn't have to wait any longer for The Rock to try and reestablish his demigod status, this week sees the release of his film. But did he manage it? Well that's the big question. One thing is for sure all signs point to the fact that they took it more seriously than the film from the start of the year. First off Paramount gave the film a pretty high budget. Then they took the filming to Hungary where they could get even more for their money without really messing with the quality, 'cause already with Hellboy 2 the Hungarians have proved they know how to put together a visually pleasing film. Brett Ratner got the director's chair who's proved that he knows how to make a blockbuster. It's true he's not really a very original director with few truly original movies to his name but somehow a lot of producers have his name pop into their heads when they need someone to put together a project they are convinced will be successful. You can make a case for the script being placed in the hands of untried writers but obviously this film isn't even going to be known for its scripts depth. Not that we'd want it to be either. Then we get to the film's star The Rock it can be totally said that he's pretty much a hot name right now. Even if his name right now isn't a guarantee for success, 'cause really his biggest successes came for brands that were pretty established. Either way the afore mentioned signs pointed to this being an entertaining trash movie. And the result? Unfortunately mediocre. Fourteen hundred years BCE, a tormented soul walked the earth that was neither man nor god. Hercules was the powerful son of the god king Zeus, for this he received nothing but suffering his entire life. After twelve arduous labours and the loss of his family, this dark, world-weary soul turned his back on the gods finding his only solace in bloody battle. Over the years he warmed to the company of six similar souls, their only bond being their love of fighting and presence of death. These men and women never question where they go to fight or why or whom, just how much they will be paid. Now the King of Thrace has hired these mercenaries to train his men to become the greatest army of all time. It is time for this bunch of lost souls to finally have their eyes opened to how far they have fallen when they must train an army to become as ruthless and blood thirsty as their reputation has become. There is a twist to the film that sets up the whole thing in the first scene. That is that the hero is just a normal mortal, but he is a mercenary who with the help of his brothers in arms talks up his legend and makes himself a demigod claiming he is in reality Zeus' son. The film starts with his cousin talking him up and telling tall tales about how he fought with a bunch of mystical beings. Brett Ratner keeps playing with the audience, anytime you're convinced something supernatural is happening it always turns out that this is just a trick and an illusion. Let's be honest that's a pretty interesting twist of the story. It is pretty much in line with what was expected a mindless action parade. The films basic story is flat and the script is filled with weird one liners but it's okay 'cause that's also what was expected. The actors do a good job with the 1D characters, there is never a second of development and definitely no depth to them. Of course whoever got the bright idea that The Rock should be the star had to have known what they were getting. Dwayn Johnson is like Schwarzenegger. He doesn't act they kind of just write films around him/ for him. The Rock fills the screen and owns the movie. He's really cool and badass. That's it. Nothing more but that works for him and it's pretty entertaining. So if you like The Rock's films this won't disappoint either. But it has to be said that despite the many negative things in the film it works. It's fun, fast paced and visually pleasing. Unfortunately the makers made a mistake that could have derailed the whole thing and that was they tried to make the ending serious. That was a mistake. Then the entertaining film became lame. They shouldn't have done it. Hercules until the last quarter of the film is a typical mindless entertainment summer flick, brainlessly visually pleasing and action packed, but likable and enjoyable. Then it just goes off course. So it's a 6/10 that could have been more without the ending. https://www.youtube.com/user/Videodromeblog",Hercules
117,thedukeofmovietown,Only slightly better than the 90s TV show,5,31 October 2016,"I saw HERCULES! Now, this new sword and sandal film might as well be a sequel to Scorpion King because it's pretty much the exact same movie. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson plays Hercules in this movie and unlike a lot of other films, this version is more of a man than demi-god with the legend of his exploits far exceeding his reality. With his team of mercenaries, which includes Ian McShane, Ingrid Bolsø Berdal, and Rufus Sewell, he travels the world in search of gold and glory. However, Hercules' true metal has yet to be tested as he fights against a new enemy which holds mysteries of his past. Now that's all I can tell you without giving anything away. This movie is trying really hard to recapture the magic of Gladiator and mix in a little bit of that mystic Troy flavor and it might have done that if it were handled better. First off, The Rock is not a very good actor...like at all. He's like Stallone, as long as he doesn't talk, a la Rocky & First Blood, he's great. This movie doesn't get it, and it ends up giving Johnson too many opportunities to put his foot in his mouth (shined up and turned sideways of course). The second thing is that the movie is rated PG-13 and I'm sorry but if you're going to try do this right, it's simply got to be an R-rated film. Without the brutality it comes off as like a tiny bit better version of Hercules the 1990s TV show which MAYBE they were going for but ehh... I highly doubt it. Overall I'd say this is a good Redbox movie but with so many other choices this summer, save your money. It's not bad, it's just passable. Put it on the shelf as better than Alexander but not quite as good as Troy and just BARELY under Scorpion King. Hercules gets a 2.5...out of 5.",Hercules
118,TheReviewMaster,Hercules Returns: Funnier than Ever,7,7 May 2015,"INTRO: Unlike others I enjoy Brett Ratner films. I find his directing simple yet creative. I enjoyed Rush Hour, Rush Hour 2, Red Dragon, Tower Heist and even X-Men 3. Rush Hour 3 was a bore though.PROS: The violence surprised me. I don't like seeing someone stabbed and the effect of violence watered down. Hercules didn't water things down, and it didn't overdo it either, striking the right balance. The cast was superb, the characters they portrayed some of the best I've seen in a film in a long time. The witty humour in the script had me laughing the whole way through. It's by no means a comedy, but damned good fun. The Rock is best when he's not playing it serious, and he appeared to be enjoying running around in a skirt.CONS: The musical score had no real motifs or cues that stood out, and music is a big deal for me in movies.OUTRO: Hercules returns in an adventure that puts Kevin Sorbo to shame.",Hercules
119,gemandeye1,Good movie that could have been Great.,6,9 March 2017,"This had the makings to be a iconic film in the same genre like 300, Troy, Gladiator, etc. but it just didn't get there. I watched it in 3D which definitely had added a point or two since that was done well. However, the movie itself was just lacking something. They had a great cast. No complaints on the acting. The script was a bit too corny at times. IMO if they would have stayed on task with just blending the myth with the history and not tried to force any silly dialogue in this movie would have been a classic. That and maybe added a bit more intensity ad length to the battle scenes. Many scenes just seem to get cut short. I know there is a director's cut that is just a little bit longer but I' not thinking the few extra minutes are going to make this one. This is not a waste of time by any means. Enjoy it as a simple sword and fantasy movie. Just don't have your expectations set for an iconic epic.",Hercules

There are moments of Predictability, and Cheesy Dialogue, but overall enjoyable. It's a good action movie. And - you grow to care about the characters.

122,Rasalgheti_2000,how many times are we supposed to watch the same crap?,2,20 November 2014,"through the years there have been recurring characters, it is all about the movie makers, they are well aware that most of the public are nothing but a bunch of fools who do not think, and of course they (directors, writers, studios) can afford to make films about the same character over and over and again and again, being sure that popcorn munchers will arrive to put their asses in the cinemas. An example of this,are Robin Hood, Dracula, Tarzan, The Three Musketeers, and of course Hercules. This year only three different versions of Hercules were released . Maybe are we all blind? it is that just we can not demand that at least for one year, another story is recreated? something about a historical person? are we doomed to see again and again the same crap at the movies? what do you you think? are all of you happy with the stuff that the entertainment industry has to offer?",Hercules
123,pjr235,Great movie. Must watch.,9,27 October 2014,"I loved the little bits of humor sprinkled throughout. The movie was very textbook and quite predictable, but in this day and age, all we can hope for is a good journey and that's where this movie got its rating(for me). It kept my attention, flowed at a good pace and didn't take itself too seriously.I don't know why people are so stingy with their rating. I'm rating it on how good of a time I had and how well I enjoyed the movie, and it was great! I don't think there was much more that I could ask for.I already got plenty of mythical beasts from Clash Of The Titans.(if I'm remembering the title right.)Here, we get a different and more realistic take on the legend.The sets! CG or not, some of those cities were breathtaking! I think it was Athens/Hercules' home where he lost his fams. All that marble!I'd like to take this time to thank the makers for not getting cheesy with any crappy romance. They brought us up to it in the end and then let us decide. Thank you guys. I hate when the focus of the movie is clouded by that crap and I'm glad they showed that a movie can have all the right stuff and not have it be all about getting to screw the Queen or the Princess at the end, nice as all that is. We got a solid story with fantastic action. I loved all the characters.I recommend this movie. If my review helped in any way please be sure to hit the like/yes button :) Happy watching.",Hercules
124,tiffanyyongwt,I quite like how this movie debunk and deconstruct the classic mythology and provided insights how legends are formed,8,30 November 2014,"Dwayne Johnson as ""Hercules"", what other reason do I need to watch this movie? Being a fan of Greek mythology, Hercules is a familiar story. And fans often used this point to judge my review, feeling that I should be disappointed with the movie. Too bad, I'm not at all disappointed, as it gave me almost all the elements I look for in a blockbuster (though with a little too much absurdity nearing the end- toppling with gigantic statue of Hera with his bare hands).I quite like how this movie debunk and deconstruct the classic mythology and provided insights how legends are formed (thanks to Hercules' nephew Iolaus (Reece Ritchie) who boasts and exaggerates the stories). Well, at least that's also how many ""Gods"" in Taoism were formed! Here, Hercules is a mercenary who uses the tales of his ""divine"" or mysterious parentage and superhuman labours to woo new clients and scare the enemies.While some may find the action scenes a tad over-the-top, I like the exaggerated feats which make one think if those spectacular (past) battles are really what happened. Hey, it's based on a comic and a mythology!With fast-pace, funny and charming (lines), Hercules' sidekicks were all given their moment to shine with their skills (and Iolaus with his gift of speech) which made each character memorable. Yes, the female-version of Hawkeye, Amazonian warrior Atalanta (Ingrid Bolso Berdal) was pretty good, though VERY busy with her single arrow shooting.Avid Hercules fans will most probably hate me for liking what they hated, and if there is really anything to pin point on, it would most probably be somewhat fake CGI of the mythical monsters, thought there weren't many of them (thankfully!)Hercules (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) Ain't Dwayne Johnson THE Hercules? Duh, who else but him? I can't remember who was the previous Hercules actor after watching him as one. Forget 300 (or 400 or 500), Rock's the person. Any one else, but Johnson, will look ridiculous in his conquered lion's head and loincloth skirt (Remember Luna Lovegood in Harry Potter?). The fact that he pull this look off, made him the best and only choice for Hercules.Amphiaraus (Ian McShane) (Spoiler Alert!) Amphiaraus is perhaps my next most favourite character besides Hercules. As the famed Seer of Argos, Amphiaraus was able to predict and foresee the future quite accurately, with the exception of his own death. While others try their best to avoid death (and you know how it usually end: You can't outrun death), he is one who accepts death with open arms. When he prophesied his death in a rain of flaming arrows, the epic slow motion when the time really come, and Amphiaraus welcoming the ""gift"" of arrows yet, missing every single one of them, was hilarious.

125,Incendid,The better Hercules of the year.,6,26 July 2014,"Ciaran's Review: Hercules is an action packed fun adventure film with a half-decent story, okay acting and of course great action. To start, the film is directed by Brett Ratner, personally i only liked Rush Hour, which was one of his earlier films. Anyway, his directing wasn't annoying throughout the whole movie, there were a few scenes where he seemed as if he wanted the audience to notice his directing, but for the most part his directing was clean and didn't annoy audiences. The story in this movie was definitely not a strong point, according to the end credits, the film was adapted from the Hercules comics, i have not read the comics and i still managed to follow the story. There wasn't anything special in the story, although towards the end of the film we do see some twists and turns which did prove to be entertaining and i was actually quite interested in what could happen next. I will say this, the story is quite clichéd and therefore was quite predictable, but i feel the film made up for this by bringing stunning visuals and awesome action-packed scenes. Now onto acting, the cast gave a good performance all round, Dwayne Johnson although not my first pick to play Hercules, still embraced the role he was given, his supporting cast also seemed to slip into their characters. John Hurt may have been the only actor who was perhaps going overboard with his performance but other than that, the overall acting was good. Sometimes in a movie there is a great death scene that is so over the top it makes you laugh so hard that you start crying, there is one of these scenes in Hercules. So to conclude, i recommend that you go see Hercules as it is a fun action packed adventure film with a decent cast and story. Hercules is receiving a 7/10 from Ciaran.Jacob's Review: I didn't expect much from this movie but I did not really want much from it. I put this on the same level on which I put something like the Mummy series on: shallow, corny but mostly an entertaining ""popcorn flick"". The action was, at some points, ""fist-pumpingly"" awesome, the acting was good and so were the effects. It follows the story of the glory- seeking Hercules who really is just a facade or a legend to scare villains. The problem with this is that at the end of the film, he is encouraged to become the legend and gains super strength but that blatantly stated that most of the Greek Mythos was just a myth so did he really become Hercules or not? That left me a bit vexed but overall this movie can be missed but if you are looking for some good, almost 90's-esque action then it delivers. There are plenty of hilarious movie deaths both intentional and unintentional. This movie probably delivers the most unintentionally funny death sequence from John Hurt because it is so cheesy, so ridiculous and obviously computer generated that I was out of breath. It gets a 7/10",Hercules
126,mjk280,An uninteresting myth,3,15 August 2014,"I was hoping for some straight-forward action and some good old fashioned brawling with this one, but the industry continues to amaze me by screwing up movies where all you have to do is......not screw it up.The beginning of the movie tells the tale of Hercules in quick flashbacks, describing the adventures and trials he's completed in the past. Defeating a hydra, a lion with impenetrable skin, etc. This was really interesting. So interesting in fact that they could've probably made a movie about it! Unfortunately in a bizarre case of decision-making the writers decided to have this movie revolve around how all of that is just a tall tale, and Hercules is actually just a tough guy mercenary. He and his group of kill/maim for hire buddies use the tale to scare and intimidate those they might be paid to ""take care of."" In short we're treated to a tale of a muscly guy who beats the crap out of people instead of a mythical figure who fights interesting monsters and completes deadly tasks no mortal man could hope to survive. Also, he wears a felled lion's head on his........head. I thought it was a goof at first but no, that's really the look they were going for. So Hercules and his group accept a job that will give them all the gold they could ever want. They train common folk to fight before the big battle at this point. Sorry, they don't train them to fight. They train them to all stand in a square with their shields and protect whoever is inside the square. Because that's what we want to see. Not The Rock tearing ass through villages or enemy encampments or something. They took one scene from '300' where the characters take a defensive position and based the majority of the action on it, and a nice little chunk of the plot too.Well lo and behold what do you know? The ""villain"" they've been chasing this whole time (who we know nothing about) is actually a good guy! To boot, the king The Rock has been working for is the bad guy! Why? Because the movie says so! The Rock and his group decide to take on the king and his armies against all odds and succeed, culminating with The Rock pushing over a statue half as tall as the Washington Monument. Seriously. Then there is an implication of ""was he just mortal or was he really something else?"" *barf*Ian McShane was the one bright spot in this movie. It's a shame this is what he's relegated to. He's a very good actor. John Hurt was John Hurt, which is fine. The Rock himself does a pretty good job and was a good choice for this I thought, it's just everything around him is extremely mediocre. The rest of the cast is very forgettable, though there aren't too many fleshed-out characters in this movie. They beat you over the head with a little back story on each of The Rock's companions but most of it is just to give you a little something to work with as you watch these people.Overall, a crap effort but all they had to do was show how bad ass Hercules was and all the cool things he did. Instead we get too much talking and a plot no one cares about.",Hercules
127,geoffgee,An excellent retelling of a mythological character's story,10,30 July 2014,"I went into the cinema expecting this version of Hercules to be a somewhat lighthearted telling of the legend. I even wondered if I might be about to see another spoof movie! What I found however, was that what humour there was seemed to have been almost entirely selected for inclusion in the trailer. The actual film I found to be a much more serious and dramatically told story. For me that was a pleasant surprise. This is a story with considerable depth. It is also brilliantly filmed with much artistic beauty apparent in the sets. I saw it in 3D on an Imax screen and the whole spectacle was breathtaking. The acting throughout is excellent and I felt great empathy, especially towards Hercules and his diverse band of companions. This is another fine example of a modern retelling of the story of a character from mythology (I saw and reviewed The 'Legend of Hercules' back in April which I also loved). My recommendation is to go and see Hercules at least once at the cinema - then buy it on blu-ray or DVD when it comes out. That's what I'll be doing. Highly recommended 10/10.",Hercules
128,stevenfreekin,Discover the man behind the legend,8,25 July 2014,"Well, just as i expected it turns out this version of Hercules was better than the one from January this year. This movie was pretty entertaining and fun. The Rock pretty much did his ""The Rock"" thing and everyone cheers together in unison. The supporting cast did a great job, especially Ian McShane's character. John Hurt reprises his role from V for Vendetta as the corrupt power hungry king who suffers the same fate. This version of Hercules is equivalent to the idea behind Robin Hood (2010). There's no magic or any mythology crap like in Clash of the Titans as we all know none of those gods actually existed.So if you're interested in finding out the origin story of how Hercules became The Rock then this one is for you, but if you're gonna argue about crap like him being white and mythology then definitely the Renny Harlin version is for you.

129,orlando-somera,You've got to be a wimp to not like this gorgeous flick,9,6 August 2014,"I'd been badgering my wife to see Hercules with me for one reason only, it stars Dwayne Johnson. (OK two reasons, I'm also a fan of Greek myths.) Now Dwayne may not be the poor man's Channing Tatum but he's genuine and unique and miles above the likes of Arnold Schwarzenneger who seems almost inhuman next to him. Of all the fine actors in Hollywood these days, he's the one guy I'd most want to sit down and have a beer with. I'd really like to know what it's been like for a big guy like him growing up in the US. I can't imagine how he's been able to keep his head straight.This film, which has the best costumes I've ever seen in a movie about the ancient Greeks, uses Johnson's rather puzzling persona (a gentle soul in a strongman's body) to emphasize the story's take on the Hercules myth, that he was only a man coping with a huge reputation.He's picked up a ragtag gang including an Amazon (Ingrid Berdal) who immediately grabbed my attention when she displayed some of the most beautiful moves I've ever seen any woman perform in any action movie, ever. For the rest of the movie I found myself secretly wishing she'd survive every dangerous situation and be in the next scene. Then there's Ian McShane as a seer, the only bit of supernatural indulged in, who is probably the next most attractive character on display. McShane seems to steal every scene he's in and shows himself a consummate showman.But the star is Johnson and for me, as a guy, I understood every expression on his face and every inflection in his voice. It made me think about having power and what it could mean. Johnson as one of the most likable big guys in movies is the perfect guy to give those questions voice.The plot is clever, the production values top notch as is the entire cast. The direction is a little rocky but this is still my favorite Hercules movie, hands down.",Hercules
130,tags_skeewee,Wait until it comes to redbox,2,25 July 2014,"Wow, just came from viewing the latest movie with the name Hercules in the title. Why, oh why must Hollywood continue putting out this garbage. This movie is a little better than the Keller Lutz movie but not by much. Why does Hollywood feel they have to make naturally violent movies into watered down, boring ass pg-13 movies!! It is so unbelievable when you see heads and body parts b being cut off without spewing blood, I mean really, why bother trying to cater to 13 year olds, lots of parents these days let their younger than 18 year olds see rated R movies anyways. It completely takes away the realism of the movie. I found myself rolling my eyes thru most of the movie. Why can't we get movies that are supposed to be about ancient times actually put the effort to try to really capture the time period. The soundtrack for this movie sucked. , really, it did nothing to bring you into the movie. Yes there is action, but as said above, lo bloody battles, there was no tension, you knew no one was going to die during certain fight scenes. The costumes looked like they borrowed them from other gladiator movies. The scenery was forgettable, bland, uninteresting. There was zero character development so you don't care about any of the characters. There was one scene where they were yelling at each other that made me think of the scene in the movie Scary Movie where Damon Wayan's character and his friends are getting high when the killer character is smoking with them and they start yelling ""WHATS UP"" repeatedly. I like Dwayne Johnson but I didn't really believe he was Hercules. His mannerisms and speech made me think of his wrestling character The Rock. I could go on but I'm tired. Tired of these crappy movies.",Hercules
131,nick-sultana,"""I... AM... HERCULES!!!"" The best adaptation of the muscular hero yet!",8,27 July 2014,"There have been many takes on the story of Hercules in book and film, but this year we have had 2 different takes; The Legend of Hercules and this one. ""Which one was better?"" is the question but this review will provide the answer in satisfying reasons why Hercules triumphs better.Dwayne Johnson (a.k.a The Rock from the WWE) has played a fair amount of action heroes in his career in film, but seeing him portray the mythological half-man/half-god hero was no surprise since he was Mathayus in the 2002 action flick The Scorpion King (seeing it now makes the film look so dated and cheesy) but seeing him now in another similar role has improved him over the years and overthrows TSK. His body though is pretty much bulked up for the role, undergoing a massive training routine at the gym (you would see in his Instagram/ Facebook posts) and the final result does truly represent Hercules's appearance as told in the mythological fables. The supporting cast includes the wonderful talents of Ian McShane (Deadwood), John Hurt (Hellboy and V For Vendetta), Aksel Hennie (Danish action-thriller Headhunters and making his debut in American film), Joesph Fiennes (American Horror Story: Asylum), Ingrid Boslo Berdal (Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters) and Rufus Sewell (Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter). They all get a decent amount of screen time and provide the story with some great performances, none of them go over-the-top (besides the action on screen) but it looks as though they had fun during the filming production.Speaking of production, the production of this adaptation is truly close on terms of detail and realism and the cinematography of it plays a big role. The direction of Brett Ratner (X-Men: The Last Stand) is pretty much better than expected, he does give an eye for detail on action, character, story and even set pieces. The locations used in the film are much like the impact that Game of Thrones uses on audiences, they make us want to see the real beauty of it through our own eyes and again cinematography helps this. Storyline itself is well written and composed by the writing talents of Ryan J. Condal and Evan Spiliotopoulos, but it loosely follows the graphic novel Hercules: The Thracian Wars by the late Steve Moore but the fault is that the plot is short (for an 98 minute film) and it could have possibly gone longer by adding some more character development, action scenes or even a deeper back story to the hero. The action sequences themselves are very entertaining and come up frequently when needed, so there's no sight of stopping to keep the audience glued to the screen. There's plenty of swords, shields, chariots, sandals, fire, arrows, sharp spears and CGI assistance to accompany the action, but another fault with it that it lacks the bloody imagery (as violence in Mythology was pretty brutal at times) but I think they aimed the film at a younger audience to keep box-office sales up. Maybe in the Blu Ray release we could get an extended cut featuring more scenes and shots of the action, but I still find it entertaining.Overall, it's probably the best take on the Mythology muscular hero in sometime and shines a light on the character that can be told right. Unlike the dreadful The Legend of Hercules (with featured a wooden acting hero, too much CGI imagery and a plot that's all over the place), Bret Ratner's Hercules is a definite popcorn action flick that ticks the right boxes for how Hercules should be seen to modern-day audiences. Fingers crossed if a sequel will come in the future.",Hercules
132,vampiri,matinée rubbish,3,30 July 2014,"I never learn! 1 + 1 = 2, once again I watched a thrilling trailer and read a decent Review in a respected Swedish newspaper, that handed Hercules 3 out of 5. All in all, I had such high expectations.Plot: after his legendary 12 quests Hercules leave for Thrace to quell an uprising. But this new task involves more than just smiting some armored crooks...The Review in the Swedish newspaper mentioned Errol Flynn in relation to Dwayne Johnson, and that Johnson lacks Flynn's matinée abilities. This is quite true, Think Robin Hood (1938) , Captain Blood (1935) and the Sea Hawk (1940), Flynn mastered these types of films, especially that smile of his, full of charm. Well, Johnson lacks this charm. But still he has evolved as an actor, and is, by me at least, no longer considered as a lump of muscles only capable of some cheesy one liners and bashing in heads.Back to the matinée classification...yes this is definitely a matinée Movie. It took me about 2 minutes into the Movie to realize this. You can hear it in the tone of the voice over, the look/color of the print and the looks of the first crooks to be killed off. It has the mandatory silly, although occasionally good/funny, one liners, lack of depth in Everything, standard plotting. A matinée must at least have charm like Flynn's Movies mentioned above or the Pirates of the Caribbean installments.Another thing that is missing, which I Think is vital to this type of film, is the fantasy/legend elements. The fantasy elements are present in quite old Movies like Jason and the Argonauts, and new Movies like Clash of the Titans and Immortals. This is a Movie which is built on Greek mythology and this is, on the whole, missing here. Greek gods and creatures would have made the Movie better.The supporting actors are decent enough, especially my fellow Scandinavians Rebecca Ferguson and Ingrid Bolsø Berdal. Mcshane and Sewell do not disappoint but seem a bit off in this genre. John Hurt is excellent as usual until the end where he starts yelling like a teen getting grounded. The worst miscasting I have seen in years is the casting of Joseph Fiennes, what is he doing here?This genre, what I call sword and blood genre (although ""matinée"" itself may be considered being a genre on its own), demands these things because getting your arm chopped off should generate a lot of blood, Think Braveheart and you will know what I mean. I like Clash of the Titans, and yes, it does not have a lot of blood, but it has charm, better actors and generally higher production values instead.It lacks plot - the story is very thin and has no Eye brow-rising surprises.However, the scenery is good as well as the armor and weapons.If you favor matinées and do not crave blood, and like the following Movies: the Legend of Hercules; Pompeii; Clash of the Titans (1 & 2); as well as the Hercules TV series and Xena Warrior Princess, this Movie is for you. Yes, when I Think of it, Hercules: the Tracian Wars is too much TV Hercules to my taste, and is what I Think ticked me off.Sadly, I won't hand out more that 3 out of 10.",Hercules
133,oldgirl,Liked the message,8,18 January 2015,"For those wanting a 'genuine' mythology Hercules; this is not the movie for you. For those wanting a dark and realistic take on Hercules; this is not really the movie for you.

This isn't one of them, but it was worth the price of admission and the time spent. I'm glad Johnson got this movie done, and glad that I watched it.",Hercules
134,patbradley435,One thrilling ride,8,24 November 2014,"This movie deserves much better ratings here on IMDb. It is well made and a really good romp. Okay, you're not going to get an Oscar performance from Dwayne, but the rest, such as John Hurt, Peter Mullan, Ian McShane and Joseph Fiennes can be trusted for great performances every time, even though they're a tad over the top in this, but splendidly so. The visuals and special effects in this film are top- notch and the battle scenes are very stirring indeed and extremely violent and graphic. There was not a single moment in this that I was distracted or bored. I give all credit to the director for the great job he has done.Don't listen to some of the negative reviews, this is a great fun movie that will not disappoint. Go see it.",Hercules

I read the user reviews on IMDb before i came in to see Hercules and i must say i find this movie underrated. I came in with a low expectation because i didn't think Dwayne Johnson is capable of acting in a 'serious' movie, but i was proved totally wrong. This movie was already good from the first minute. I loved the narration, the cast, the characters, the plot, the plot twists, everything! It was only 5 minutes ago that i walked out of the theater but I've typed this much, i really cant get over how good this movie is, its probably one of the best movies I've seen in months, even year. There are a few goofs that i find funny but its not enough to bring Hercules down, for example I doubt there is even the word 'fuvking' back then. Go see this movie with your family and friends asap. I am not usually this crazy for legend fictions but i swear Hercules is worth your time and money.",Hercules

137,jacob-m-ford97,What happened in 98 minutes?,6,27 July 2014,"It's hard to find an original idea in a movie these days. Sometimes it seems like every major blockbuster released is either a sequel, a comic- book adaptation, or some sort of remake. ""Hercules"" is no different. Adapted from the graphic novel titled ""Hercules: The Thracian Wars"" which was of course adapted from the ancient Greek legend, this film had few original ideas. At the start Hercules, the supposed demi-god, and his band of warriors are traveling the Grecian world, killing people as they are paid to do so. We soon find that Hercules is not actually a demi-god, but rather a very large man whom he and his companions have fooled the Grecian world into believing he is the son of Zeus. The story develops as a very attractive woman comes begging for Hercules to come save her people. Hercules agrees, once a fitting price is decided upon, and what results is Hercules finding both his biggest challenge yet and his heart. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson stars in this film as Hercules. Perhaps being the thickest, brawniest, and largest professional actor working today, he fit the part very well. Visually, that is. The acting left a little bit to be desired. Never uttering a single line that was not in the form of either a mumble or a full out scream, it was extremely difficult to find any sort of personality in Hercules aside from the fact that he was played by ""The Rock."" Rebecca Ferguson takes the largest supporting role in this film, playing the damsel in distress. Her performance was just as empty as Johnson's, which honestly was the case with the entire cast. John Hurt plays the part of the wimpy king who's in need of more leadership than his kingdom, Tobias Santelmann sits in the role of the initial villain, Rufus Sewell, Ian McShane, and Ingrid Berdal play members of Hercules' heroic gang along with Aksel Hennie playing the silent Tydeus, who's supposed to be your favorite character. As the film began I actually became excited. The way screenwriters Ryan Condal and Evan Spiliotopoulos decided to leave fantasy or magic out of the story, and have the characters play upon that fact, really sparked my interest. However, they were inconsistent with that. Not inconsistent by having supernaturals play a real part in the story, but inconsistent by the fact that this is what they were planning to do and didn't do it. I really wanted to see Hercules be a large baby who had to have his companions do everything for him, which is what the first few minutes of the film set me up to believe. Unfortunately this didn't happen, and as soon as this became evident I lost most of my interest in the film.That's honestly where the entire fault of this movie came: From the first five minutes. And what happened there almost seemed intentional. For example, the first one or two scenes were overflowing with visual effects, and visual effects that were extremely poor. But just at the start, the rest of the film had good quality animation. I initially thought that this was just because the VFX artists had done a lousy job, but where the dialogue and story led in the next two scenes led me to believe the visuals were bad in order to mock the kind of movie they were making. However, as the story developed, I found that this was not their plan, and whether it was intentional or not, the visual effects used in the first few scenes actually were just bad. My biggest issue with this film is that I couldn't determine what director Brent Ratner wanted to do with this movie. What I got from advertising was that this was going to be a full out action/fantasy film. What I got from the first few scenes of the movie was that this was a movie mocking itself. What I got from the rest of the film was a bland mixture of the two. I didn't dislike this movie, but I had no reason to like it either. So as I left the theater I felt the exact same way I felt as I was walking in. And that should never be the case. I give ""Hercules"" a 6.5/10.",Hercules
138,Ali-hamza-re,Hercules,8,29 October 2014,Well start with it that people saying the film is bad and awful but sorry for the spoiler it is not. the movie is great. great action scene well written and the visual effect is simply amazing. I know that the trailer is false it say we see monster i agree with you at that point but the is not bad without monster and the battle field is thrilling. The twist in the film is great. Dwayne Johnson done a great job its acting and appearance is simply great. I love how good the Dwayne Johnson look in Hercules. If you think the film is bad well if you love CGI and action scene then you can watch this film it take only your 90 minute. I know you can spare that much time to watch the film and your time will not be waste and it is worth watching. I love love every character in the the film and some great glorious scene. I hope i will watch typically like that type of film. Great 8 out of 10 worth watching,Hercules
139,Fredtimbo,"Oh, Dwayne",6,11 July 2017,"I may have liked this movie years ago had I not seen Gladiator. And Troy. And Thor. And 300. I really like Dwayne Johnson and a few of his movies--Walking Tall, Snitch, The Rundown--but the excellent supporting cast (e.g, Rufus Sewell, John Hurt, Joseph Fiennes) did not make up for his acting in Hercules. He may not get nominated for Oscar, but he's capable of better acting. Movies in this sub-genre have become cliché, and this narrative of the mythological character was rather predictable.",Hercules
140,theflixerdotcom,This is not the Hercules are looking for...,6,25 October 2014,"To be honest, I didn't get a chance to go to the theatre to watch this one. It seems like I wasn't the only one I think the major flaw with this movie was certainly the story that was used. This was based off of the graphic novel series which kind of humanizes Hercules instead of having him be the demigod he is alluded to being in the legends.I know people are on a big realism kick, but I think in the story of Hercules it hurts him more than helps him. That said, apparently he still has super strength. He does things such as flip a horse with his bare hands, and kick a horse drawn chariot (minus the horse) at bad guys with enough force to take 3 of them out. This was a bit of a problem for me because the direction they were going was that he was not a demigod, and he even says as much, but for some reason he still possess inhuman strength. I call that inconsistent.Luckily, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is the one playing Hercules. He is such a strong actor that he is able to carry this movie by himself and I think his portrayal was good given the material he had to work with. I think both he and I would have liked to see him portray the original Hercules and not this watered down version.In the end, this movie is a good action movie but I wouldn't say it's a good Hercules movie. If you go in with that expectation, you will enjoy it.",Hercules
141,joelsmith190,*Heracles 2014,10,7 January 2015,"I did like this. It was a good mix of action, comedy, and had some good plot twists. There are only a few gripes for me to go with on this one. For one, it lacks a good villain. For two, they used the wrong name for Heracles, because they used the Greek names for the gods, but then used the Roman spelling for Heracles (Hercules). I understand why they did that, but for a myth-buff like me, it's a bit annoying.All-in-all, I thought it has potential to be one of the best movies of the year. It's the third best I've seen thus far (after TF4 and GoTG, in that order). When I saw him face the Nemean Lion, I was a little afraid this was going to be a ripoff of Scorpion King (even though Heracles was actually an archer in the mythos), when I saw the bow (and I'm a big Mummy/Scorpion King fan. Have been since I was a little kid). But this movie easily bests the disappointing ""Legend Of Hercules"" with Kellan Lutz. It has two of my favorite actors: the Rock (obviously) and the bad guy from A Knight's Tale, Rufus Sewell who is barely in any movies.This movie has great action, great acting, a few really cool characters (namely Sewell's, Johnson's, and the old spearsman/oracle). Every other character was bland, but I didn't mind that so much. This movie takes out the annoying dragging on and romance annoyingness of some movies, and gives you a non-stop, at times hilarious, throw guys around. I at first predicted that in true Season Of The Witch and King Arthur style, that his entire team dies, but.... Eh, you'll have to watch the movie.It's definitely worth a watch, even though it's not like Clash Of The Titans or Percy Jackson where it's more mythos-based. It's a man dressed up in a lion's skin with a big ass club. If you like this kind of stuff, it's definitely worth a buy.This movie gets an all-around 9.5/10. It's really good. It never drags on, or at least, not for long. It's pretty badass. With some really cool characters (some of the team, Heracles himself, and the bad guy and the other guy could've used some more diving into of their characters though). The twists are a little surprising, but once you watch the movie through, it makes complete sense.",Hercules
142,dim404,Better than the reviews,6,13 November 2018,"I liked this film. I am a history buff but petty things like names, chronologies, stirrups and lots av anachronistic details do not seem matter in this fun movie that wasn't even filmed in Greece. The Rock is pleasure to see and especially the deconstruction of the Heracles/Hercules myth is enjoyable and humorous. Good acting in this context and good cast overall.
Recommend it as is.",Hercules
143,acutler,Trailer misleads badly- the movie's not bad at all,7,26 July 2014,"OK the trailer said this wasn't the legend we had heard. But the trailer did showcase mythical creatures and implied we would still see ""The Son of Zeus""And here lies the film's problem. And it isn't really the film's problem at all - it is the trailers!It simply means that the entire audience start watching the film and within 5 minute experience a massive downer on the film as it appears Hercules is a fraud, a common mercenary living off his fake tales.If the trailer was done properly this would not be a problem, because if you can put the trailer and the marketing out of your mind, what you actually have is a decent popcorn flick that is by far the most compelling telling of Hercules on-screen since the animated Disney tale, and in many respects it surpasses that tale in a much more satisfying manner.The trailer should NOT have shown any of the mythical elements, which belong to dream sequences and tales within tales, barely 5 minutes of the movies running time.Forget the trailer, enjoy the movie for what it is. It is not first class, but for Brett Ratner it is surprisingly coherent story-telling, and The Rock and his fellow actors sell the rather predictable twists with surprising humanity. Much worse is offered at the summer box office.",Hercules
144,nsterjo,Surprisingly good!,8,27 July 2014,"I usually reserve the word ""impressed"" for one or maybe two movies every year, and this summer has been generally unimpressive with its cinematic offerings. I wasn't gonna go and watch this one, but I had some time to kill and needed something light and entertaining to watch. I came out of the cinema pleasantly surprised. The best thing about this movie I'd say is the fact that it doesn't offer you too much but it provides you more than you'd expect. Although quite predictable at times - as if that can be avoided in Hollywood - it manages to surprise you in many ways, not the least of which is how they have approached the whole story of Hercules. Acting is faultless, including The Rock, who is not the best actor out there, the script was not hateful or lame, and the directing quite decent. All in all, I had a good time watching this movie and did not end up being disappointed or hating it, which is the only reason why I would say that I was actually impressed by Bret Ratner's Hercules.",Hercules

Don't do that. Don't set yourself up to be let down - let down by your own preconceived notions and expectations of what something will be, when you have none to really go on other than the poster...As far as movies (and the news) go, Hollywood has the final say in how anything they put out is going to be. That is just how it is. ""Have-no-expectations-other-than-expecting-to-be-entertained"" way of looking at ANY Hollywood production, and go from there.

This movie was a blast, the story about Hercules in the movie, was really intense. This is the real legend of Hercules, not that p*ssy a** ""Legend of Hercules movie,"" f**k that movie. The characters in this movie do act like real warriors that'll save the kingdom. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson does a great job as Hercules, when he plays as Hercules, he just nails it. This guy is a complete bada**, he knows how to come with clever stuff, and knows what a warrior should be. The king in this movie is kind of a dick, but I understand why he's like that, because he does want to rule the kingdom his way. The other characters that help Hercules on his journey are pretty good as well, and their personalities are pretty interesting. The action in this movie was awesome, it was pasted right, it was intense, and watching it in 3D makes you feel like you're inside the battle field. There is also humor in this movie, and the humor did make me chuckle a bit, of course I will admit that Hercules has some really white teeth, yeah and it's kind of looks silly, but that didn't bother that much, what did bother me was the dream sequence that Hercules always has, because they keep on use it again and again, which does get a little annoying. Overall this movie was awesome, it may not be the best movie of 2014, but it was a lot of fun, and Hercules is worth buying on blu-ray, if it's unrated, because I still think it needs an unrated directors cut, when comes out on blu-ray.",Hercules
149,pouge162,Better then Expected,7,1 September 2014,"This was one of those movies I really didn't expect much, but it was pretty entertaining. It plays Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson to his strengths and his supporting cast adds to the fun feel of the movie. It's by no means a masterpiece, but what it is, is a good popcorn film with enough action to entertain the adults and clean enough to let the kids watch. It's definitely a 10 for the boys in their teens. It reminds me of the movies I liked as a kid that age (The Beastmaster, Conan, and the original Clash of the Titans).This movie takes a new twist on the old tale. It tells the story as Herc as a mortal with a great PR campaign and plays with the notion that he is maybe the real thing. Ian McShane does a humorous job as Amphiaraus with his somewhat talent for prediction. The rest do well enough (The actress playing Atalanta looks remarkably like a younger Nicole Kidman).This is a movie that deserved a better reception at the box office than it received, but I believe it would have done better as a winter movie, but it will do great in the DVD/rental and many people will see that it is better than expected...",Hercules

Of course the story could be a little more profound, and the secondary actors could be a little more interesting, but its a Brett Ratner movie, so you cant expect much more I'm my opinion. The movie have good special effects, a decent soundtrack and is short for this kind of gender, just 1h40 minutes thank the lord, more of that and it will be unbearable.So if you don't have nothing to do on Sunday afternoon, and you have kids in the house, you can play this movie, it will entertain all the family and allows you to do something else at the same time you watching it.",Hercules

But after seeing the other recent ""Legends of Hercules"" film with Kellan Lutz, which was terrible, I was skeptical. However, this film is actually very good. This film takes a different approach to Hercules than normal. It made for a good film that is different than other versions. The film is packed with action and fight scenes which are mandatory in this genre. I enjoyed the battle scenes. The biggest surprise was the film did not feature any Gods or Goddesses, which seem to me always are a requirement for films about Greek/Roman mythology and heroes. But this film actually did not need Zeus nor Hera. It is a solid film.Sidenote: Dwayne Johnson and Jason Momoa probably go up for the same roles. I think Dwayne would have made a better Conan if that is ever redone. But this kinda film is his wheelhouse.",Hercules
152,iepw12,Simply excellent entertainment,10,3 August 2014,"I give this film ten simply because it was way up there for sheer entertainment, with no over the top blood and gore , something I find mostly completely uneccessary. It made me laugh when it was meant to and it had that 'Saturday morning pictures'(sorry all those under 60years old) feel of excitement without any of the cheap sensationalism which so many films seem to employ these days.Maybe others call it cheesy but I actually like it when the good guys win(a certain George Lucas made quite a success of that). So if you like the poster(Dwain never looked better) you want to be entertained for 98minuites without having to work too hard, I'm gonna say this is an excellent (maybe great) movie and I will check back in to see it again tomorrow. Oh yes and it has two movie moments which are superb in my view, I leave you too work out what they are but they both involved the 'Rock' at his best even if he did need to swear for one of them, it was worth it, and the other, well Heros always have to emerge from clouds of smoke or flames or some such and given how hard the man worked to get himself looking right I reckon he does one of the best emergence ever, go and enjoy it, and watch Tinker ,Taylor, Soldier, Spy another day.",Hercules
153,bestcriteria,Simply awful,2,25 July 2014,"I wanted to like this movie so much, and it was a big let down. I like mythology (primarily Greek and Roman), have read most related stories, and was looking forward to Hercules.I was let down, but was not alone. To my surprise, the theater audience was mostly old people, as myself, so I imagine that they too were hoping to see another mythology-based movie; but a good one.Too bad - the movie creates it own stories, and they are not any good. SPOILER There also is a lot of inconsistency - one time Hercules can defeat powerful foes and even hurl a horse over his head, but moments later mere mortals can easily bring him down if it is convenient for the story, of course. And you guessed it, a few moments later yet, he displays awesome power again.The supporting cast is good, but Dwayne Johnson just doesn't cut it - well, at least for me, anyway. I can think of many other actors who may have made the movie a little less bad, but they probably did not want any part of it. There were a few funny moments (very few), and Hercules mother, at the beginning of the movie, was promising to watch, but she appeared only for mere moments.Did I watch it in 3D? No! I have watched enough 3D movies now, and the truth is that after a few minutes, the 3D 'magic' disappears and I don't even notice the effect. I am convinced that our own brains make up for the 3D in our minds, and a regular movie looks just as good, and it costs half as much. This Hercules is not even worth in DVD!",Hercules
154,urgentneptune,Hercules Review: The Legend of Rockules,8,29 July 2014,"Hercules ReviewDwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson stars in this narcissistically named movie chronicling the adventures of the famous Greek hero. StoryRockules and his band of merry misfits act as mercenaries for hire in this clever spin on the classic myth. I suppose you could consider the following a spoiler even though it is revealed in the first fifteen minutes of the movie. Regardless: SPOILER ALERT! In this movie, Hercules is not portrayed as the actual son of Zeus. Instead, he is just an incredibly strong and powerful man whose story has spread throughout Greece like a monster killing Paul Bunyan. So everyone in the country thinks that Hercules is a demigod, but only the viewers (and a select number of side characters) know the truth. Hercules is accompanied by 5 other mercenaries who are infinitely more interesting the Hercules himself. The fellowship consists of The main man himself Herc, a female archer, a bloodthirsty mute, a comical soothsayer, a storyteller, and a man who throws knives well. Their quest: To live like Kings by working for whomever pays the most.Using the tales of the all-powerful Rockules, the Fellowship of the Rock increase their fame and their wealth until they are hired by a King to train his troops and lead them into a mysterious civil war. From that point on the movie consists of great action packed fight scenes and secret motives of the King lead Hercules to make a moral choice become the real hero everyone thinks he is. And that he does! By the end of the movie, I was pondering whether or not he was actually the son of Zeus. He certainly performs like he is.Since the story of Hercules is one that has been told many, many times, a lot of his back-story is essentially summed up in a couple of minutes. The audience is almost expected to know who Hercules is so they can focus on all the head clobbering action. The side characters are really cool and have a lot of potential, but their backstories are not explored as much as I hoped. Hercules (referencing the movie itself and not the main character) steals many ideas from other other movies, especially 300. However, it makes up for this fact by blatantly referencing 300 multiple times throughout the movie. These all made me laugh, so the unoriginal ideas have been mostly forgiven.All in all, plot was way more interesting and complex than I expected, and while most people will only remember the fight scenes, I will remember this movie for its creative interpretation of the ancient legend.Acting/DialogueNote: Because the movie uses actual Greek names that are impossible to remember, I will be describing the characters rather than naming themDwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson (who looks more like a tank than a rock) plays Hercules well, especially since Hercules is a character of brawn and therefore is not expected to be eloquent or well spoken. This, overall, leads to some poor dialogue that consists of mostly one liners.Best performance in this movie goes to Ian McShane, who plays the soothsayer. His character is by far the most complex and interesting. Plus, he's funny! With good supply of comical relief and a stellar performance, McShane's character helps hold the movie together.SFX/ActionThe fight scenes (as previously mentioned) are very 300-esque. However, the battles in Hercules seemed to be the perfect scale. Even with a realistic amount of soldiers fighting at any given time, the action seems non-stop and is almost exhausting to watch. Everything looks real and (for the most part) remains within the realm of possibility. Hercules obviously steals most of the glory when it comes to awesome fight scene moments. Nevertheless, the Followers of Rockules hold their own, and together as a team, they seem unstoppable.ConclusionWhile not Dwayne Johnson's best movie, I thought Hercules was great. I personally give it an 8/10. I know some may disagree, but one thing is for sure: Hercules is a hell of a lot better than Transformers: Age of Extinction.",Hercules
155,sjd912,Weird mix of King Arthur and 300,5,24 July 2014,"Hercules wants to follow the footsteps of the self-proclaimed ""historically accurate"" movies like King Arthur or Kingdom of Heaven: it strips down the legend of the mythical-creature-fighting demigod to a skilled mercenary, who uses the help of his fellow warriors creating his fame. But at the same time the movie has a similar design to a 300- copycat: cheap dialogs, cheap sets, cheap costumes, weak characters, horrible acting (I mean, what the hell was Joseph Fiennes doing???) and pretentious slow-motion. Most of the battle are like they're from the pages of a comic book (of course, it IS a comic book adaptation, but still...): every swing of Dwayne Johnson's sword kills two or three of his enemies, one of his warriors can shoot 3 lethal arrows at the same time, and most of these things are just simply laughable. Although I must admit, while Brett Ratner's action scenes might not be the most creative, they look cool, and they deliver a little fun in this weak film.So the main problem is, that while the movie wants us to take it seriously, and not to look like an immature fable, that's exactly what it turns out to be: a shallow, dumbed down, generic fantasy-blockbuster.",Hercules

Dwayne Johnson is charismatic, and brings a very human element to the legend, and this is something I really liked about the film. It didn't rely on superhero like feats that are completely outrageous. Of course there are some elements of that, but they try to give the impression that the legend of Hercules is something that is just that...legend, fostered from rumour and misdirection.Well cast, each actor played their roles believably, and delivered the script as expected. Decently written, it didn't feel too campy at any point. Like some others have said, it takes a few minutes to really grip you, but when it does, you won't stop watching! And really...that's the exact purpose of movies, especially ones like this.So in the end, I found myself liking this a lot more than I thought I would walking into it.

159,LeeRob7,"Where hype and creative, dramatically exaggerated storytelling makes a legend into a demi-god",8,10 August 2014,"A different twist to a classic tale. Without giving away too much (because you definitely should see this movie!) Day be Johnson plays the daring, super strong hero of Greek mythology told in fables across time depicting ultimate masculinity. Hercules, son of the god Zeus (or not) embarks on many missions/trials of bravery across ancient Greece for... well... money gold rather than notoriety and heroism, they're just byproducts of his daring deeds. He, accompanied by his band of fellow mercenaries, fight battles against insurmountable odds, monsters (rather people dressed as monsters) and hordes looking for fortune and fame culminating in unwittingly enslaving the kingdom of Thrase for a tyrannical Lord who declares himself king in the same of Hercules' success against the rebels. Seeing what be has done, Hercules decides to follow his heart and act selflessly to right his wrongs and liberate the kingdom ultimately fulfilling his heroic potential with the aid of his trusted followers. Johnson does well as the muscle bound, super strong in this somewhat more believable tale of the Greek hero with an excellent supporting cast all round. Where clever hype and dramatic storytelling pave the way for mislead perceptions of a demi god in the minds of the masses. Very entertaining and enjoyable which every action buff will thoroughly enjoy. Brilliant cinematography and fight scenes with exceptional writing ultimately let down by a surprisingly rushed, tame ending. I hope there's a sequel, 8/10.",Hercules

"" Hercules is an interesting movie..easy conflict and stays in line with the fact that the Hercules is a demigod, the son of Zeus.The most different with the series, which played by Kevin Sorbo is this movie shows a beautiful logic battle and shows a true strength of Hercules and his labors.The story is smart enough than any Hercules before.Dwayne Johnson, Ian McShane, Rufus Sewell, John Hurt act so promising in this movie.I watch in 3D and it was so great! Honestly, there are so many beautiful women in this movie, love it so much: Atalanta (Ingrid B. Berdal), Ergenia (Rebecca Ferguson), Megara (Irina Shayk), Karolina Szymczak and Barbara Palvin. Maybe it was part of the strategy to kept the audiences awake stays on the screen. and it works!

There are no CGI monster fights, but a few good sword-and-sandles epic battles.Most importantly this movie knows what it is and know how tired the usual origin story tropes are.

The Rock was terribly miss cast, and is evidence that not anyone can play any role. He was totally wrong for the role of Hercules. I am a fan of his, but this was not a good role for him.

The question of what we believe or imagine to what reality truly is???....Don't be late for this movie as the start of this movie is good to watch. It is stitched with bravery, honor,strength, brutality and bits of humor. Watch the 3d version of the movie it structured for that. Acting, stage, costumes are good.

Lets just pretend, that Hercules actually was a mercenary, and that he fought alongside with others.If we forgive all of the history inaccuracies, if we forgive the horrible actors, the excruciating script, and the mixing of Greek gods (zevs, ares, Hera etc.) and the name HERACLES, switched to the roman HERCULES.

Beyond that, there is nothing, but that doesn't make for a bad couple of hours if you like action period films. If there is anything to criticize specific to content, it is perhaps in the final shots we might see a poorly scripted, overplayed, and hastily wrapped film. ""Get the dirty bastard!""?? Yikes.

And what nonsens is the the ""raided village"" scene now? Was it all faked?
This makes just too little sense at all.But the real bummer is the showdown!
This is so ridicilous and so plain stupid!
Why do Lord Cotys men even follow him at all, although he just revealed his true evil face?!?

One of the biggest reasons I found myself enjoying this movie as much as I did. As Syfy goes, there isn't any exceptional CGI or totally unbelievable feats of strength etc. The fact was the STORY played a bigger part than the action and gave the entire movie balance between the two.

172,johnptomai,"Fair, but could have been Epic",6,6 November 2014,"Yet another movie falls to the formula method of Hollywood. The story of Hercules at it's core is a saga of a bastard son. Born as the illegitimate son of the God Zeus and a mortal woman, Hercules has to struggle to survive the challenges of the gods, thrown down to him on earth and ultimately choose if he wants to be god or man. Its a Jesus saga. A superman saga. The premise of the core story of Hercules could have become a masterpiece movie in the hands of a great writer and director.In terms of the story & characters: I would have liked so seen the authors flesh in the drama of Zeus and Hera at the birth of Hercules. -Shakespearean drama. -aka.. Marlon Brando scenes at the birth of Kal-El. -Mother, Father, and evil Hera collide and conspire to ruin/save the life of young Hercules.From there, I would have introduced the ""Rock"" with detailed scenes of the challenges his ""parents"" through at him. -The Dydra, the Lion...etc. Instead, these amazing opportunities for character development were given the 15 second treatment. Intelligent viewers want to watch characters evolve into heroes. We want to see why they are who they are. We want to see them evolve from nothing, against the greatest odds to become champions. From that foundation, the entire second half of the movie -Hercules Conquests- would have meant so much more. And this movie could have been one of the greatest character dramas ever.-In my opinion, Dwayne Johnson possesses all of the acting skills to be the character of a much larger, more deeply founded story.",Hercules

It is just a film based on some faked ancient events with some eve catching action sequences. The cast is good. They do a reasonable enough job. But still could have been better. I still have hopes for Hercules though. I guess that there might be another part of this film coming up in the future.

174,ColeMan88,"Decent Movie, Good Summer Flick",6,30 July 2014,"'Hercules' is about Greek demi-god, Hercules (Dwayne Johnson), who has gone through and completed his twelve tasks to be allowed to live free. After completing these twelve tasks, the daughter of the King of Thrace, Ergenia (Rebecca Ferguson) seeks Hercules help to defeat warlord Rhesus (Tobias Santelmann). 'Hercules' is an action packed film directed by Brett Ratner.'Hercules' is a rather average film, on many aspects. However there were a few stand-out features in this film. This is a good movie to go see with friends during the summertime. However, if you are a critic going to see 'Hercules' you may be a little entertained as well.The acting performances in the movie were pretty average. The best performance definitely came from Dwayne Johnson. It was one of his better performances, but not his best. I am getting quite impressed by Dwayne Johnson. I feel he is developing into a pretty accomplished actor and is not far off from having a great role. Costume design was done pretty well. Cinematography was a little better than average. Editing a little worse than normal. The CGI was good at some times and really bad at some times. Other than these four features which were a little better or a little worse than average, everything else was about average. This should make for a good summer film, but not a very critically acclaimed film.The best thing about this film, as you could probably guess, was the action sequences. The action in this film is a little far-fetched, but then again it is supposed to be. This movie was made for the summer, just to gain some money and for people to go and enjoy. One more thing about this movie that was done pretty well was the writing. Writers Ryan Condal, Evan Spiliotopoulos and Steve Moore do a pretty decent job with dialogue and it was nothing to be ashamed of.Overall, 'Hercules' is a fun film that you can enjoy with your friends. If you are a critic, you will not be surprised, but you will not be disappointed. With good action sequences and decent writing and acting, 'Hercules' received a 6/10 stars from me, but it could have received a 6.5/10 if allowed to.",Hercules

If you use 300 or Troy as a benchmark this movie falls utterly short. It's still a watchable movie, but it just fails to impress.This is no low budget movie. It's clear they spent plenty on it. That makes it even worse because you know that they had the resources to make a great movie, but squandered it.The story is weak. There's nothing captivating about it. Hercules doesn't seem interesting enough. His companions add very little and take a lot away.The dialog is ordinary. You are unlikely to hear anything that will stay with you for very long.The soundtrack is average, though not poor. A great movie needs a great soundtrack and Hercules doesn't have one.Character design/development is very bad. It's hard to say how good the acting is because if the very design of a character is flawed no amount of good acting can make up for it. Most of the support characters seem very uninteresting and for the most part act randomly. Dwayne Johnson as Hercules seems OK. He certainly has the looks but I don't think he received the necessary support required to really make the character his own.The only great feature of the movie are the visuals, which are stunning. In all other aspects the movie is average. It's not unwatchable though. Just go in without big expectations and you should be treated to a decent action movie.",Hercules

It tries to show Hercules as more of a man than a demigod and fails at it. The sets are false looking, the fights are false looking, and in the end it all comes down to Hercules' superhuman strength to win a fight. So where is the frigging reality, again? The plot is threadbare thin, and very cliché. In fact, it reminded me of the plot of Gladiator = Emperor has wife and children killed, hero gets betrayed, hero avenges and gets accolades of the public at the same time. Oh, and there is no payoff from all the emotional moments that are set up with the supporting cast.Good for casual viewing on a lazy day when you have run out of ideas for good movies.

183,Chronosus,Big book of clichés,4,10 August 2014,"Hercules, the mythical hero we all know and love. Except here he is replaced by a pretty strong regular human that needs help of his friends to get the job done. What we are left with is a movie about mercenaries set in ancient times, and it's hard to fault the audiences for expecting something more epic because myth of Hercules has so many great scenes that Hollywood is so good at depicting. It just seemed like a perfect opportunity. Instead here we have a wasted opportunity in a movie based not on the myth but graphic novel that questions Hercules divine heritage. That would be fine if they built a movie around this and actually toyed with idea and tried to confuse audiences with the question is he demigod or not, but it's clear from the get-go that he is not, and not only to us but to the people of ancient Greece in the movie. Wasted opportunity this is indeed because filmmakers had an ideal Hercules of this generations of actors - The Rock, and one of the rare heaps of muscles that can actually do some acting. Both he and the supporting cast are solid throughout, but they are given just a bunch of clichés that should pass for dialogue, and often it's to the point that you could quote exactly what they will say before they say it. All this could be corrected with some beautiful scenery, photography and great battles. Battles are the only thing passable but nothing to write home about, and special effects and photography feels second grade. So what we have here is a movie called Hercules that isn't about Hercules but some mercenary, and which goes through all the regular hoops for this type of movie, that has all the potential in the actors but fails to utilize it and ultimately the movie that you'll probably forget about in a month. Cmon Hollywood, give us the real Hercules!",Hercules
184,barok_232,Very disappointed...,3,27 July 2014,"I'd love to tell you that this movie was great but I'm not into lying.I very fine cast, a very fine director and a very fine mythological hero lead to a mediocre result. Seems impossible to think at first, right?In my opinion it IS impossible to fail, unless of course one would be that stupid into changing the ""mythological"" theme into a ""reality"" theme. Because that's what they did with this movie. One would expect to see Gods such as Zeus appearing, and of course mythological monsters such as the Lernaia Ydra. Now you'd object that the Lernaia Ydra WAS in the trailer and I have to inform you that whatever bits you saw in the trailer containing mythological monsters (eg Lernaia Ydra, the Lion of Nemea etc), that was the exact amount you'll see them in the film. It's just in the first 2 minutes' opening and later on you'll realize it is only the story-telling by Hercules's nephew, Iolaos, ergo: not really happening in the film.The movie portrays Hercules as a mercenary, who is being hired by anyone to provide war services in return for gold. He also has a whole team assembled (/facepalm) in which his nephew (Iolaos) is the PR guy, promoting stories about Hercules being a demi-God, just to advertise him enough to get him hired. There is also a prophet in the team who never predicts anything in an absolute manner, only says things like ""the Gods are not telling me..."", and even if he does, he is later proved to be wrong. So is he a demi-God? The movie doesn't say for sure, but everything suggests that he's not. The ending of the movie is not only very annoying and uninformative, but also tries to be educative-moral, saying ""anybody can be a hero if he believes in himself"" or a similar crap line. (/vomit)The story evolves around a ""job"" that Hercules is given, to help a king restore his kingdom's peace blah blah blah. Then there is some sort of mystery regarding how his wife and child died (/facepalm) and in the end there is of course a conspiracy-like turnaround that proves the good guys to be the bad guys blah blah blah (it's boring even to try and make it into words really, you won't even care about the story, trust me).Let's try to sum up. You will not see Hercules-the mythological figure in this film. If you want to see Hercules go check out the cheap production TV series with Kevin Sorbo. This is just a movie to fit the genre of movies like ""Spartacus"" or ""Alexander the Great"" etc. It is based on the REAL world whereas it should all be MYTHOLOGY (fiction).On a more technical level, cinematography is OK with some good action sequences. Movie is full of cliché, stupid punchlines, you know, anything that would make the movie ""american bullshitty flavored"". So the movie is a joke for the brain, and, if it weren't for the decent direction and the big budget, this movie would be a joke for the eyes and ears too.Anyway, see it once, it won't bother you that much, but I doubt you 'll ever want to see it again (for any reason).",Hercules

188,d-justins,One of the best movies of the year.,8,23 November 2014,"Give me a moment and I think you'll agree. This year has not produced many good movies. When i saw the information for Hercules, I expected a CGI-filled yawn-fest, not really offering any value. This movie was quite opposite of my expectations, which is probably why i enjoyed it so much. Instead of a movie of CGI monsters filled with CGI battles, we get a story of a proposed-lifelike history of how the Hercules myth started. This was a nice twist to the very common, boring (action-packed) films that have been put out recently. The casting of the movie was spot on. The attempts at staying relatively close to accurate history (i.e. Location of city-states, relationships between the city-states, and constitution of armies (small in number)) It was really nice to have choreographed fight sequences, yet the movie is less about the fighting and focused on relationship dynamics. I really enjoyed this film and hope they make a sequel.",Hercules

190,shamrock_d,An adventure - thoroughly enjoyable ...,10,2 November 2014,"I stayed away from watching this version of Hercules because a friend who had watched it while visiting her son in the US said it was terrible.However, as I read other reviews, doubt began to creep in and thought maybe it's worth giving a try. I'm glad I did. I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish.I am a teacher of history and I had always been fascinated with legends and mythology in different cultures. I'm glad, though, I read some of the reviews here revealing that this was the story of a man and not Hercules the demigod replete with fire-breathing serpents, lightning and magic. I can understand, however, how readers who venture here are misled to thinking this was just another Greek mythology tale with all the special effects. There were none of the special effects associated with fantasy but effects were definitely there.Yes, the thunder was there in this movie but it was in the battle scenes, the emotions and the wide vistas of the landscape and the thousands of soldiers filling them crashing into each other in thunderous roar.The acting was good but we need to put down and behind us the other somewhat mindless roles that the Rock (Dwayne Johnson) had been typecast into, otherwise our judgment may be tainted and all the actors in the movie will suffer from this bias.See Hercules as a man - and as a man he fights - with the internal demons that haunt him as well as the physical forces of weapons, men and the manifestation of his nightmares.What I also liked was the touch of prophesy brought by their soothsayer-warrior accompanying them in their exploits - with each prophesy coming true in surprising manifestation. So, we are not completely bereft of the influence of the gods and destiny in this tale, yet there is none of the booming voices and flashes of lightning announcing their presence.Yes, we need to leave the mythology and legend behind to enjoy watching this. We are, however, given an alternative theory of how Hercules - his heroism and feats - spawned our beloved tales of Hercules the demigod.Sit back, enjoy the story, the action and the scenery.",Hercules

Even at the end you aren't quite sure if he really is a demi god. That said, lol, he can pick up a horse and slam it down on its back, and rip the jaws of a wolf apart with his bare hands This film, simply put, is awesome. Awesome, there I said it, I hate myself for loving it, but it really is that good. I cannot think of a single bad thing to say about it. You may see it and hate it, but genuinely I loved it. It has everything that an entertaining blockbuster action film should have - bad guys, swords, fire, explosions, monsters, fisticuffs, disaster, comedy, action and abundant special effects.

And also, if you don't believe in yourself maybe you have the fortune to have a number of friends who believe in you and somehow this trust is internalized by you. As for the rest of it, Lord Cotys (John Hurt) wants power for the sake of power and the frame-up made by King Eurystheus (Joseph Fiennes) to Hercules is lacking in credibility. That frame-up would make sense if that man wanted to take your place, if you felt threaten by his popularity. But when you know that all he wants is to live in peace, you let him go. I have to mention that the director suggested that the movie is for adolescents, and too much critical thinking is not recommended for an afternoon of effortless entertainment.",Hercules

My question I ask is why a surprise, the rock is my hero, but I think it's because these genre of films often don't keep my attention. But I never once turned away from the screen with a hint of boredom. Instead my head was nearly in it wanting to fight alongside the rock!

No story or characters. Main character of rock has no substance nor he has any expressions. Nothing much to write aboutRock maintains same expression. I don't blame him since there is no change of scenario anyway. What i did not understand is whether the makers wanted to make this like a fairy tale or children or they wanted to make an epic like Gladiator. Either way, they failed.Visual effects are good though and only thing which could make me sit without running away",Hercules

196,tripolis29,Reality vs Legend...Decent try by Dwayne,8,31 July 2014,"I rarely review, but this time I really had to do it. I really wanted to share my good impressions about this movie. I entered the theater with really low expectations, not to mention very different expectations regarding the plot. I expected the plot to focus at least for a while on the 12 Labors, but it didn't. But that wasn't necessarily bad. On the other hand, I also expected something like Renny Harlin's adaptation, or something close to ""Hercules: The Legendary Journeys"" but no... What I saw really surpassed any expectation I had. Although I had never read the graphic novels, I found it surprisingly amazing... As a Greek, I grew up with these myths. Greek Mythology has always been the ""fairy tales"" that all Greek kids want to listen to or read about before they go to bed.. The Odyssey, the Iliad, Jason and the Argonauts, Theseus, and the 12 Labors of Hercules among so many myths. You read about people and places that were near your hometown, or the place where you live. It's not the Middle Earth, it's not Narnia, it's Athens, it's Arcadia, it's Macedonia, it's Thrace, it's Sparta...places where so many heroes walked and fought and were glorified. I was born in Arcadia, near Nemea, where the Lion killed by Hercules was supposedly roaming... What I enjoyed in this movie is the fact that it plays with the idea that a myth, a legend can be real at some point. That every legend is based on some true facts, on actual persons, on real events and this film explores the process through which a story can grow and become a legend and a myth. Hercules killing the Hydra, which actually might had been disguised soldiers, or Hercules kills with his punch, when he was actually holding a blade hidden...the legend is maintained and grows with the help of his ""agent"" Iolaus. In many ways it reminded me of Troy, which is a movie also ""landed"" on the real world, showing how a real story becomes an exaggerated legend: Achilles is found by the soldiers with only one arrow on this heel and they immediately assumed that this was his only destructible part of his body..and the legend begins... I want to give credit to Dwayne Johnson. On first look, the casting of Hercules seems a little bit out of the blue, and I have to admit that I'm not a Dwayne Johnson fan, however, I liked him a lot. And I really liked the chemistry of the supporting cast. At one point it reminded me of Arthur and his Knights' chemistry of Fuqua's film ""King Arthur"". The film without using mythical creatures as in ""Clash / Wrath of the Titans"" it manages to deliver a lot. As a Greek, I didn't feel insulted as I was in ""Immortals"". Good work Brett Ratner.",Hercules

Think this movie sucks but I think it's a masterpiece really we don't know what happen to Hercules after the 12 labors (I think) but really The Rock fits well as Hercules and the battle scenes are just amazing don't hate on this movie but really if I'm missed everything wrong with it just tell me I would understand the acting is good too and the movie at least needs some thoughts really the movie is a b tier if I had it,Hercules

Movies like Star Wars: Attack of the Clones have the same flaws (bad directing and awful screenplay) but at least they have awesome special effects and compelling action scenes. In this movie also CGI is cheap and the duel in the opening scene is ridiculous. Beautiful landscapes, that's the only good point and the reason I gave it 3/10 instead of 0 I don't demand historical accuracy or a perfect knowledge of classical mythology to enjoy a movie. I loved The Gladiator, for instance, but if you have to cook something up, do it well. Or, at least, don't call it 'Hercules' but give it a fantasy name.",Hercules

200,soundwave86,"Try The New and Improved""Hercules""! Now Completely 'Mythology' Free!",2,5 August 2014,"If you're a fan of the Mythology of Hercules in any way, shape or form and expect to see it in this film, you will be sorely disappointed. This film has pulled a complete ""World-War-Z"" and left absolutely EVERYTHING about the original mythology out except for the fact that it is called ""Hercules"". But what about all that awesome trailer footage? You know, of Hercules and his amazing feats of heroism? Surprise! Nothing but trailer fodder that is all over in the first 2 minutes of the film. The main focus and theme of the film is how Hercules is NOT the Hercules from myth and legend. So right off the bat the trailer has straight up lied to you. But don't worry, what they leave out from the actual mythology of Hercules they more than make up for in plot points that are VERY BLATANTLY stolen from every other medieval/ancient era epic film made in the last 20 years. Everything from beginning the film with the ever popular ""you think you know the story of Hercules? Here's the REAL story of Hercules"" narrative, to timeless cliché classics like ""sidekick leaves due to differing views but returns during climactic battle to save the day"". Even if you aren't looking for a true-to-its-roots Hercules movie, this movie is so completely generic you could substitute just about any other epic of the same genre and you'd swear it was the same movie. Right down to the costumes and battle sequences. The story is painfully predictable, the jokes are hammy and don't fit the tone of the genre, the characters are stock, wooden and forgettable, the fight scenes are boring, the action is unsatisfying.Bottom line, if you aren't a Hercules fan looking for actual Hercules action then you'll be less disappointed than I, but I would still recommend skipping it and saving your money by simply watching Troy/Braveheart/Kingdom of Heaven/Beowulf/Robin Hood/300 instead; the experience will be the same, I promise. However, if you have ever enjoyed the mythology of Hercules and want to see some of it brought to life then this is not the film for you. It is the cinematic equivalent of biting into a chocolate chip cookie only to find out they're actually raisins.",Hercules
201,brijester,Just about OKbut it's demeaning to the Hercules Character,6,9 August 2014,"I went for this movie first day, first show. Before seeing this, on the morning of that day, I saw the rating for this movie on IMDb. It was just 6.7. Still that (unfortunately) did not deter me from seeing the movie. Then, I saw the trailer of this film. Trailer was quite good (as most trailers are). But sadly the movie wasn't even half as good. Now, as a movie, it's good no doubt. But the point is, it's a HERCULES movie. And that is where it fails. The character of Hercules has a lot of mythology around him. He's a demi-god who's been renowned for his strength and nobility and for fighting against Gods and monsters. But in this movie it's depicted that most of the ""facts"" about Hercules are either completely false or they are exaggerated. And this is the reason that I'm angry ,as any Hercules admirer might be. It might be a ""new take"" on the character but still I think it's not proper to change the core of the character, especially the very part which defines the character; the part that makes the character very likable. In the beginning of the movie, it is shown , for a few minutes, that Hercules is fighting the legendary monsters like Hydra, Nemeean lion etc. Bt those scenes are shown as part of a story that a captured character was telling to some pirates in order to instill some fear in them about Hercules. Throughout the entire movie, there is NO sign of any Greek gods or goddess or any mythological creatures. Here, it is shown that the character Hercules is a mercenary who works for money. It's really ridiculous. The original Hercules (the one that we are familiar with) would NEVER become like that, even if his wife and children were brutally murdered. Dwayne Johnson might have he physique to play the role of Hercules but his acting is hardly memorable, to say the least. He should stick to those roles which suit him (especially action-based roles, where emoting is not required). Atlanta and Ergenia are very pretty but their roles are quite small. Joseph Fiennes, a fine actor, is wasted in his minuscule and ineffective role as King Eursytheus. I have no idea as to why an actor of his caliber would do such a role. Maybe he's in dire need of money. Or maybe, he lost a bet. This movie can be avoided. Nothing great in it; just passable. Only die- hard Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson will enjoy this movie; Hercules fans will hate it.",Hercules
202,psymax,The Rock is Herrrcullllllessss!,7,26 August 2014,"Here's a good example of a movie that you shouldn't make assumptions just from watching the trailer and maybe do a bit of research first. I was really hoping for a special effect laden film filled with CGI monster fights that had epic demigod versus mythical creatures.""Clash of the Titans"" and its sequel ""Wrath of the Titans"" have proved that audiences like watching fantasy/adventure films. I felt so misled. This film actually wants to do the opposite. Here's a film that wants you to know the truth behind the legend and the myth. So, I was a bit disappointed. I was even getting a bit annoyed at how ridiculous the violence was in this film. I felt at lost on what, was happening. I then realized that there is a team dynamic in this latest retelling of the Hercules saga. I find it quite endearing that in his travels, Hercules had gathered people who were in one way or another shared his fate, to wonder the lands in search of purpose and redemption. In a way, Hercules had somewhat created a makeshift family to replaced the one that he lost. Once that was established, the film got more entertaining and the interaction between the characters got more interesting. Waiting for the end credits, I now know that this version of Hercules was based on a graphic novel. And, so everything made sense and the purpose was clear in the making of this film. I had always done research on the films that I watch, based on the actors, directors, movie genre and subject matter. Knowing what previous Hercules films and legends were about, I made the mistake for assuming that it was the same for this one. I was so wrong, but glad that this has reminded me time and time again not to jump onto conclusions. On a good note, Dwayne Johnson's version of Hercules is by far the most closest to the likeness of the mythical legend that we all know and familiar with.",Hercules
203,corwin05-134-857653,Nice and entertaining,8,8 June 2015,"I wasn't expecting much. I mean, with the Rock in it, i was thinking it's the Scorpion King all over again... Just remember if you watch Hercule, it's not a serious movie. Like ""King Arthur"" serious. Well, i was happy with it. Just this kind of movie you watch with some friends or even alone, with some beer or popcorn... Entertainment. Yep. Nice battle, no fancy special effect once the first 10 min are behind us and that's great. No useless splash of blood every two sec to pretend to be adult.The story is about what make a man into a legend, but even with that in mind, the movie keep having fun at giving us hint that he is a demigod, then taking that back right after, making him a simple human being with a self confidence issue. I liked it, because the hero is not complaining all the time. He got his moral code, his friend, and that's it. He's not a dark, silent, tortured, bad ass hero. Here, Dwayne do a great job at picturing this kind of inspiring hero. Besides having great size of arms, of course...If you want a movie with heroes who alway looked angry at something, wrestling with cgi enemy and staring the blankness of the green screen, go for Clash of titan and its sequel, you'll be served.",Hercules

An example of one of these clichés is, brace yourself, the guy who hasn't talked for years, spoiler alert, At the end he talks! Amazing! In the first moments 'Hercules' tells us of his 12 labours, a well known tale the would have beaten this movie tenfold. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

The movie Hercules embodies everything that professor taught us about the ancient times. Hercules keeps it amazingly real, yet bringing in the glory of the ancient times of Greek legends. I guess many people are so entrenched is the Hollywood's bombastic and unrealistic special effects that they were disappointed by how close this movie kept it to reality.

Without a doubt, it is the best Hercules film since the era of Steve Reeves. Earlier this year we had The Legend of Hercules, a very weak effort and this is far superior on every level. Terrific battle scenes, nice references to Greek Mythology, great special effects and top notch wardrobe and costume design bring the Ancient world to life. A good vein of humour and a superb British supporting cast (now compulsory for this genre) all go to make this very above average for this type of movie. Dwayne Johnson is suitably heroic and turns out to be a great choice to play Hercules. Try to see the movie in IMAX if you can and enjoy the movie for what it is, an entertaining romp!",Hercules
209,showem,Just a bit of fun,6,13 August 2014,"In some reviews, people are complaining they have changed the myths around Hercules to make him more human. Seeing as this is coming from source material of a graphic novel, (which I don't know) you have to accept this might not gel with what you know of the classic myths of Hercules.The plot isn't the strongest point, or it should have had a bit more build-up and hints at what was to come, as the turnaround seemed to happen rather quickly. I feel like another movie might have been left on the editing floor. But there are many good points. The acting is good. Dwayne Johnson isn't exactly stretched in his emotional range as Hercules, but he comes across as strong and likable. The rest of the actors are good too. Not overly hammy, but not taking themselves too seriously either. There are some clever bits of dialogue between the members of Hercules' band too. The costumes and makeup are great. There is a lot of action, which you would expect for a movie of this genre and it doesn't disappoint on this front. But there are enough breaks for you to catch your breath and the plot to move along. As we wanted to simply see a fun summer movie that didn't go overboard with bad CGI or acting, this was ideal and fit the bill. By the end, I felt it was a good, although not great, movie from the ancient Greek myths. I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel, but with the story a bit more developed this time.",Hercules

So if you ignore that and that there is nothing historically, geographically or mythically right, the movie is not that bad at all. Dwayne Johnson is making a good role and it is actually gives some spin to the character. The plot is very interesting and the view of the ""Hercules"" is also very interesting and good in my opinion. I did not like the acting of Ingrid Bolsø, but other than this and completely imaginary history, everything was good.With beautiful scenery, good sound and cinematographic, this movie is great fast-sword action movie with full of 3d effects to enjoy 2 hours in the cinema.",Hercules

But the producers chose a completely different direction for this re-telling. Aside from the shorts at the beginning we see no monsters. Nor do we see beautiful gods and goddesses. Hercules' greatest enemy in this story is the very real (and human) threat of betrayal and treachery. And rather than a one man- show, we see Hercules aided by a band of loyal friends who are every bit as skilled as the demigod. The film raises the question what is more important: what others believe of you or what you believe about yourself?

This review contains spoilers.The trailers I saw for this movie made me believe it was going to focus on Hercules and his legendary battles with monsters from his labors.However, they quickly gloss over those monsters in the first few minutes, then say ""this is the story of the real Hercules,"" and the movie doesn't contain any Gods, magic, mythological beasts, or demi gods. Instead, the movie says there was only a man, a mercenary, who happen to have people spread myths and legends. That he also was never alone, but pretty much always had the backing of his friends in battle.As a huge fan of Greek mythology, I went to the theatre expecting what the trailer advertised, and was hijinxed by another ""Brothers Grimm"" that didn't even make up for it by adding some magic later, but left one wanting... The story was way too easy to call as well. I'd love to have seen another ""Brothers Grimm"" after seeing its value upon rewatching, but if they make a sequel to this Hercules, I think I'll pull an Autolycus, only I won't be returning.Only surprise to me, was them chaining up the ""animal"" at night because he suffers PTSD, then having him unchained at night in another scene helping Hercules with his ""ptsd."" Pretty sure they just missed the error but it still made no sense.All in all, I gave it a 4/10 because it was watchable and had some nice action. The advertising for this movie lost it a few points alone since it wasn't what was advertised, the acting was OK but who in their right mind would ever have cast the baker who moved to Germany in ""How I Met Your Mother"" as a fighter...also her scenes seemed like they just wanted to add a Legolas character as well as a female to the ensemble of characters.

He makes it point blank up to the 20-30 archers eventually, only to fight them hand to hand combat with his axes. Whoever directed this movie needs a good firing.

The supporting cast played its role very well too, providing good support. Sure, don't expect mythological accuracy, cause here you won't find it. The only thing that bothered me a bit is that in the end of the film they portrayed some of the labors being executed by the whole team, while it was supposed to be executed by Hercules solely. And the large scale special effects, like the whole fire scene and the statue destruction weren't so good. A very entertaining movie, worth its money",Hercules

First of all Hercules is the roman adaption of the Greek Heracles meaning that the original myth is Greek. Set in the timeframe of ancient Greece when the legend was live, it narrows time to a certain age. The weapons, the armor and above all the shields used in the movie is a mixture of both ancient Greece and ancient Rome aswell as used by the wast germanic tribes in the northern part of central Europe. I'm not demanding nor was I expecting full historical accuracy, but this is like taking inventions from more than a few centuries from a whole continent and putting them all together.As far as the story goes, not much is accurate here either. So as most often with big Hollywood productions, the scenery is great, the fighting scenes are lavish but the core is pretty much non existent.",Hercules

It turns out to be a comedy-action flick. Nonetheless, it is still okay for me.Surprisingly, there are no gods, evils or humans with magic in this film. What we have are spears, arrows, swords and roars. The movie doesn't turn into what we see in 《Clash of The Titans》and 《300》.There are only humans, just normal humans. Perhaps the names of Greek gods and monsters are just metaphors.

I definitely give this movie a straight 9 outta 10 because of the amazing story line and presentation. All the characters were played very nicely and the actors succeed to tell their own story without effecting the track of the events.

But non the less I was still a little put off when I realised who was playing Hercules. It's not that Dwayne Johnson is a bad actor necessarily (after all he did pro wrestle for a number of years) It's just that I cant help feeling his acting can come across a little cheesy in some roles ( again that's probably due to his training as an actor in the WWF ring) But to be honest I was pleasantly surprised & I also think that he suited the role of Hercules quite well. But lets be honest there isn't a hole lot of A celebrity out there in the land of Glitz & Glamor that is Hollywood! that can play a muscle bound ""Demigod"" with the strength of 10 men. And he done such a good job in scorpion king! Over all I give the film 8/10 5/10 - for being start to finish action, blood and violence (after all isn't that what we watch these films for?) Another 2/10 for the completely fresh take on the Legend that is Hercules (I'll say no more on that, just watch it your self's) And the extra 1/10 is for ""Atalanta"" Played by Ingrid Bolsø Berdal Mmmm hot & dangerous! my favourite kind of women :)",Hercules

The Rock is his usual bad self and the acting overall was decent. Special affects were OK. Again everything about it was ""ok"". As I said in the title, wait and rent it later and save yourself some money.",Hercules
225,joanna_ts93,A surprisingly fun and realistic portrayal,8,4 December 2014,"Before I watched the movie I expected the usual mythological face of Hercules. Being Greek, I've grown up with these myths and watching movies about them can be both fun and frustrating.This movie took a different road by not giving Hercules god-like powers and making his legend a more reality based one. Although I do love the myth, I liked the more realistic version a lot and surprisingly the writers and directors did a good job of not making this a mess of anachronistic events and ideas. I will not go as far as to say that it is historically accurate(when we're talking about 13th cent. BC how accurate can a movie really be?) but it was a very good melding of myth and reality.What surprised me the most was how much Dwayne Johnson fit the role of Hercules. He had the slightly ironic, slightly tragic and very barbaric face I always gave Hercules in my mind.All in all, this may not have been a masterpiece but it was a fun way to spend the night and I will probably watch the movie again in the future when I want something entertaining and comparatively light.",Hercules

I was expecting the Hercules of classical mythology.Acting was pretty good, so if the story line would have been better, it could have been a really good movie.It didn't feel like it was taking place in Greece.I have to admit that I did nod off a couple of times, but luckily I was at a drive-in where it wasn't noticed.I probably won't buy it when it comes out on DVD, but I may rent it to watch again.",Hercules

I'm sorry, but if you aren't a Dwayne Johnson fan or a muscle building, teeth breaking, blood shedding type of movie guy then this one is not for you. Awesome performance from the rock. Who could have thought that Dwayne Johnson could display such acting prowess. The co-actors support him well. To hell with storyline and emotional crap as long as you get to see The Rock as the powerful Hercules bashing skulls with that thorny club thingy of his. The movie turns folklore into myth, doubting whether Hercules is really a son of Zeus or not. But who cares.....watch it for THE ROCK...And yes....i am a Dwayne Johnson fan ;)",Hercules

Everything is cheesy, the plot is ridicules and the whole thing is just awful! Wanted to get up and leave after the first 20 minutes but stayed cause I had nothing else to do at the moment and I like the rock...Perhaps for 10-13 years old kids it might be 'Nifty' but not for a grown- up who like theater, especially when they are guiding you and letting you know whats coming next...

If it wasn't for such a misleading trailer I probably would have liked it a lot more. Once I watched it and figured out that in the movie Hercules was just a myth and there was no magic, monsters, or Gods, I was pretty disappointed. Still, The Rock is one of my fantastic actors.

235,monic-balt,fun take on the legend of Hercules,10,5 January 2015,"***SPOILERS*** I found the film to be quite enjoyable. The fight scenes were great (particularly loved Atalanta's movements), the funny scenes were effective (my favorites were Amphiaraus' ""dying"" moments lol), and there was no unnecessary love connection between the hero and the princess in distress.The film was obviously showing the legend of Hercules was a purely overblown retelling of their adventures by the nephew storyteller in order to scare enemies and increase their reputation. The lion and the boar were normal creatures (albeit really large), the hydra were normal men wearing masks, the centaurs were just men on horses seen from afar, the 12 labors from the gods were just jobs from lords and kings. I particularly enjoyed the animation during the credits that showed his friends were actually there and helped him defeat his enemies.If only people would stop watching movies with a set expectation on what they want to see, they would have a lot more fun watching.",Hercules

238,soulnado,What to Expect With Low Expectations,4,30 July 2014,"Never before has there been a good film portrayal of ancient Greece's favourite myth. So why would Hollywood start now? This latest attempt at bringing the son of Zeus to the big screen is brought to us by X-Men: The last Stand director Brett Ratner. If the name of the director wasn't enough to dissuade you from watching this Olympus-sized fail fest, let's dive in.We begin with a narrative of Hercules' origins. His parentage, his legend and his twelve labours. And at first it seems as though we are in for a respectable action packed re-telling of the legend.Then we remember that he's being played by the Rock.Whether you love Dwayne Johnson or hate Dwayne Johnson, there's no denying two things here. First is that he can can actually be pretty damn entertaining. The second is that there is no way in hell that we are ever going to be sucked into a performance of Hercules with such a strong American accent. And given that it's the only one in the film, disbelief already is no longer suspended.We are quickly introduced to the Rock's motley crew of fellow mercenaries. That's right - Hercules is a mercenary now. Just go with it. And you can rest assured that these supporting killers will have no further character development than: Geeky sidekick; cool but crude best friend; female Legolas; the crazy one and the old dude who is a bit more profound than the rest.After the opening boss fight, the Rock and his answer to the expendables are interrupted during a drinking session by the daughter of Cotys of Thrace, played by John Hurt, who want to hire him and his merry men to save his city from a ruthless warlord.The most interesting thing this film tries to do is to play down the myth of Hercules, in which the central characters acknowledge that he is just that - a myth. And so the people of the city that he is trying to save is given nothing more than a boost of morale, knowing that they have the son of Zeus on their side. Hercules in this film is shown a bit like Alexander the Great(or rather Michael Jordan in Space Jam). And it almost works. After all, this has never been done in a Hercules story before. Unfortunately, this means that everything we love about this character is effectively destroyed. It tells us that the monsters he faces never really existed, which sort of takes the fun out of Greek Mythology. The execution of this is ultimately a rather confusing one.The battle scenes can be quite fun, if a bit long and the CGI badly rendered. But it's here that we see the film's biggest problems. It tries to be funny and at the same time it tries to be reverent and epic, complete with it's own Braveheart speech. And it fails as both. The jokes aren't funny and they don't fit. The tone of this film is very confused, and the end result isn't satisfying.It gets about as close to the actual myth as any adaptation has ever gotten (before ultimately ruining it), and out of the three, yes three Hercules films released this year - being 'The Legend Of Hercules' and 'Hercules Reborn' - this one is the best by far. Unfortunately this is saying very little. For anyone wanting a good version of this story I refer them to Peisander.Really though, what do you expect from Brett Ratner?",Hercules
239,Yankeeserck,A great twist on a classic story...and the rock!,7,4 August 2014,"""Hercules"" starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson absolutely delivers on its promise to be entertaining. I went into this film with half-hearted expectations, thinking that Dwayne Johnson wouldn't fit the part well, I fully expected this to be an entire film of blood and fighting. This is far from correct. The writers of this film are fantastic going for almost ""A knight's tale"" vibe to it with a ton of comedy. I honestly found myself laughing out loud much more than I found myself getting drilled with constant WWE style fighting like there was in ""The legend of hercules"", mind you this is a very good thing. The laid back style of this film is what makes it so great, sadly this film failed in the box office, hopefully folks can see the potential and eat it up on bluray/DVD.",Hercules

As a fan of history and mythological movies; This is a disaster. The warfare scenes are barely adequate, while there is definitely deficiency of blood for that kind of movie. Well I guess it is a good movie for teens, to see it in school on a last day at history lesson, but it doesn't even have much historical concept. Also it's okay, if you want to introduce your small ones in history/mythological kind of movies. Good job on a trailer though, You had me fooled! I'm deeply disappointed, due to how far we have gotten with technology, and special effects - nothing is impossible anymore, yet they still make movies like a century ago. This movie is a real disappointment and in my opinion not worth a watch unless you're a first time history/mythological movie watcher.",Hercules
241,jreda1,Rock Bottom!,1,4 August 2014,"Hercules has hit rock bottom. This movie is horrible because it is worse than bad. It is boring. The plot takes time to unfold. The Rock is sleepwalking through this movie. Not even his natural charm can save this movie. I know this movie is not a comedy, but it falls flat when it comes to the humor in it. The action scenes look lame. I know this movie is PG-13, but at least show a little more blood in the action scenes. This movie would have been better if there was more fantasy in it. The movie was way too realistic for a Hercules movie. Hercules is more bark than bite. I hope the Rock does better movies than this, such as a Scorpion King 2?",Hercules
242,fairytale_damnit,Trying to be different - didn't work for me,7,24 August 2014,"I actually did enjoy the film. However it seems they were trying a new approach to the story where they get rid of all the mythical legends and portray them as no more than stories, transforming the film into just another action movie. Still, Hercules does perform some crazy deeds which leave you wondering if perhaps he is the son of Zeus after all, guess we will never know. I personally would have preferred to see some magic in this film, but that's just my opinion, you might enjoy it for what it is.Nonetheless it makes for an entertaining movie: much humor, surprisingly decent acting, plenty of action, and lots of shield walls. However, you got to be forgiving of the countless goofs and sometimes ridiculous, sometimes predictable plot.",Hercules
243,captainslone,Epic Version of the Myth,8,1 August 2014,"To begin with this movie was not based on Greek myth but on a graphic novel that was based on the Greek myth much the way the movie 300 was. The graphic novel and subsequently the movie take some small liberties as you might expect. It is closer to the myths than say, the Kevin Sorbo TV version. But if you go back to Steve Reeves, his movies weren't exactly classic myth based either and his are considered classics.Funny I should mention Sorbo's Hercules since it seems like the graphic novel may have been influenced by the series since this Hercules travels with a group of compatriots, most of which he didn't in the myths but did in the series, such as Autolycus, Atalanta and Iolaus to name a few. (He did some with Iolaus in the myths).The cast was great. I had my doubts about Dwayne Johnson but he really pulled it off. Ian McShane played well in the comic wise/man role. John Hurt was good as well but I can never see him without picturing the ""Alien"" popping out of his belly.As you might expect the FX were excellent, the fight scenes well done and exciting. The plot is part redemption story, part action flick. Hercules, beaten down by recent events in his life has become a mercenary, he and his cohorts fighting for money. But the plot, as you may guess, leads him to rethink his life and possibly choose another direction(or an old one?).Critics of the movie stick on adherence to the myths. Don't let that distract you. The movie version of Gone With The Wind did not follow the novel verbatim but nobody cared. Same with The Lord of the Rings. A good movie is a good movie. And this one is well worth the price of a ticket.",Hercules
244,MissCholula,Recommended!,10,2 August 2014,"I just saw Hercules last night. I am so glad I did. It had a great cast and kept me interested through the whole movie. Dwayne Johnson was very fitting for the part of Hercules. I believe it contained a very good message, useful for everyone. There was bits of comedy, action, adventure, and some very moving moments. It was so entertaining I plan to go back and see it again, if I can. And it has to be very good in order for me to even consider going back to see it again. It's hard to find good movies to go to, and a lot of them, in my opinion, are not worth the time and the effort. Hercules is one of a handful of exceptions. If you get a chance, go see it! You won't be sorry you did!",Hercules
245,frenchvanillacreme,"Sort of like it, Sort of don't...",6,30 October 2014,"If I wasn't already a fan of Dwayne, then I probably would not like this movie. If this movie was made with any intention of gaining him fans, I think they failed. He either shines too much, or is completely overshadowed by nearly everyone else in the movie. Now, if this movie had any intentions of making me a fan of the actress who played Atalanta the archer, they've succeeded. She was my favorite character, and one of the best. But in my opinion, she wasn't the only one that out-shone Dwayne or his Hercules portrayal. Just watch it, and you'll see what I mean.Other than that, the whole hybrid-mythology thing is odd. They're in Greece, but didn't use the Greek version of Heracles; Instead opting to use the Roman Hercules. I understand why they did it, but it would have been just a touch more believable if they had used the correct version. Overall, it's okay... I guess. I kind of liked it, but it was like nothing really happened. That archer though... I like her.",Hercules
246,eric-striblin-es,The Scorpion King....Hercules Edition,6,8 November 2014,"The movie isn't as bad as a lot of the other reviews on here make it seem. That being said it's also not a great movie either. It's a pretty dull movie overall. The story reflects back on many of Hercules great acts (which would have made the movie better if they would have spent some time on those) but instead goes with a pretty fantasy-less story of portraying Hercules as pretty much an average (albeit massive) Joe whose success seems to be based on having lots of friends instead of demi-god powers.I personally think that Dwayne Johnson is a great action star, but doesn't seem like he was given much to work with script wise here. Some decent action scenes but that is about all that is to be had here.",Hercules

248,aj-dion1,Mythology vs reality,9,16 November 2014,"Have to admit I really enjoyed this movie. Will be adding to my movie collection. Interesting twist on the common story and to be completely honest is more believable than the myth. Loved the downplaying of the ""gods"" and magic bit as in reality most myths are really just exaggerated real life stories. So this was refreshing to see. Up there with 300 to be completely honest. I did like the approach taken with the group of friends behind the scenes and loved the credits with the images of his friends helping him with his challenges. Very cool. Dwayne Johnson gave a brilliant performance and was nice to see him in something a little out of his comfort zone with the whole family/emotion thing. So can recommend to see simply for that solid piece of acting.My favorite performance was actually from Ian McShane as Amphiaraus. Was a funny twist to have someone who could see his own death and faced it head on and at times seemed to embrace it. The flaming arrow scene was very funny. Rest of the cast was fantastic as well. Thought the Askel Hennie portrayal of Tydeus was impressive and was sad to see his character die even though it was in truly epic style. Oddly this also reminded me of 300 so puts it in good company.Overall an enjoyable movie and a pleasant change from other historical/myth based movies that follow the ""common"" interpretation. Nicely done.",Hercules
249,reenieshelton,We enjoyed this movie,8,27 December 2015,"My family enjoyed this movie. We grew up watching movies such as Jason and the Argonauts, Sinbad etc. We found this movie entertaining and action packed. Ian McShane is always good in his roles. John Hurt does not let anyone down either. I think people are much too harsh in judging this movie as the worst they've seen and they apparently have not seen Pink Flamingos the absolute worst movie ever made and that is not just my opinion. How did John Water's ever become some kind of hero? Sorry I digress. Hercules does contain minimal profane language. There are no sexual situations or gratuitous nudity. Dwayne Johnson may not be an Oscar winning actor but he's not the worst I've ever seen. I suspect if you watch this movie with an open mind you may enjoy it too. Or not :D",Hercules

251,mark-snelder,Laughable failure,2,23 November 2014,"This movie is actually an advertising scam to trick you into spending money to waste 2 hours of your time. I give it a 2 out of respect for some of the main actors who were still performing their duties, despite the utter crap they were shooting during the making of the film.Indeed, there are no true hero scenes in the movie, like Hercules dealing with monsters and performing legendary deeds of any kind, in fact there was only a clumsy story of Dwayne Johnson being a mercenary in classical Greece. After an hour or so of horribly bad battle scenes where the bad guys fall like flies and the heroes seem to randomly kill people just to keep you in the cinema, the script writers were apparently pressed into writing a twitch to it, and the story actually begins. It ends there as well, after everyone you expect them still to kill is finished in a rush. Hurrah! What clumsy storytelling. What misconception of character development basics. What disrespect of the viewer.Professional shooting of highly unlikely action scenes, impossible battle survivals, ugly CGI, mediocre acting of an uninspired cast, and endless plot holes in a story insulting to the intelligence of an amoeba does not make a movie worthwhile. It still leaves you baffled by the ignorance and stupidity of its makers. I've had it with Dwayne Johnson movies. This film was not made to entertain the audience, it was made to get their money. A joke.You are warned: see something else or you and anyone watching it with you will ruin your evening together. I say it is a laughable failure and a joke but in fact it is not funny at all.

253,hobgoblinh,Good Ol' Saturday Action Flick,7,25 July 2014,"If you are looking for elegant scripting, subtle acting, or Oscar material, seek elsewhere. This is the sort of movie suitable for summer viewing, with lots of monsters, creepy villains, and bigger-than-life heroes. The Hercules of the title is supposed to be a brooding, haunted man. Now, we all know Dwayne Johnson is more adept with dry humor and hearty smiles. Well, since Arnold Schwarzenegger is getting a bit long in the tooth for roles such as these, someone else will have to take over the muscle-bound brooding. As it is, Johnson commits himself wholeheartedly to the part. In the film he brings with him a group of comrades in arms, picked up in adventures from the past. Most are disillusioned, and see themselves as mercenaries rather than heroes. Most striking among them is Aksel Hennie in the role of Tydeus. He tends to dominate scenes in which he appears, particularly those which are action scenes; a good thing, since he has almost no lines at all. The makeup artists did themselves proud in turning him into someone more frightening than most of the baddies in the film. Ian McShane had a fine time as well, as a warrior-cum-psychic with glimpses of the future. What scars the makeup people didn't use on Hennie, they saved for McShane, giving him a face that spoke of previous near-death experiences. The script gave him some of the best -- and most cynical -- lines. For once Rufus Sewell played one of the good (?) guys, Autolycus, but he seemed to be conflicted about any good impulses that came his way. It is a pleasure to watch his peculiar blend of cynicism and heroism. As might be expected, there was the token female warrior, Ingrid Bolsø Berdal, playing Atalanta, an Amazon. She tended to bludgeon people with her bow as often as with her arrows, and it is a wonder she put no one's eye out. She also was rather slender for an amazon. As for the art design, and yes, I said ART design, I think it is worthy of notice. In many of the brief moments devoted to the more heroic 12 labors of Hercules, such as the Erymanthean Boar and the Nimean lion, the designs would have made Frank Frazetta proud to know that years after his death, his designs still impact films today. The mystic blue markings on the hair-deprived, half-naked warriors in one scene were truly reminiscent of one Frazetta book cover, and all the more noticeable, because there was no good reason for them to be fighting without their knickers. Or skirts. Or whatever. The lighting of the prison scene was pure Frazetta, and there's no shame in taking a page from his book. I come from the generation that offered at least one Greek myth influenced film per year as kiddie fare, and we had the monsters supplied by the immortal Ray Harryhausen. This film reminded me of those days, and I think this film, held up the tradition very well. As art, it's a 7 out of 10, but as myths with fantasy added, it did itself proud.",Hercules
254,frankiesfavor,Hercules The Mortal,7,29 October 2014,"To be honest, I didn't have high hopes for this movie. But it was surprisingly thrilling. I even caught my self holding on to my chair during the battle against the ""Centaurs"". But let's start from the beginning. The whole plot is that Hercules really isn't a Demigod. He simply is a mercenary(with a heart- breaking backstory) with a crew who would do anything for him, seeing he already has saved their lives. The movie also contains some of Dwayne Johnsons humor, which I always enjoy. Not to mention that the characters are quite entertaining. I really wished I'd see more of Rufus Sewell though. But Aksel Hennie as Tydeus was an entertaining attribute to the movie and the story.The plot in it's self is OK, but what made the movie for me was that the movie didn't cover up the fact that it simply is an action movie.",Hercules

I'm not going to reveal anything but the story is really bad,if that can be even called a story, the acting is horrible, Dwayne Johnson instead of pumping muscles he was supposed to make the effort to learn to act. Special effects are the average for today's movies and them alone can not compensate for the lack of acting by the main actors. The film is in one word boring, does not even hold the attention. I can not mention a single bright point in this film everything has failed. I think Hollywood would need to stop making films with Greek mythology because they simply do not know how to make a film that is at least decent.

I would not say it was better than 300, but it is close. I would say there is a lot of blood shed though. It is not boring, and will keep your attention. My husband tends to get bored with some movies, and he liked this one. I would definitely recommend it as well. I think it's worth watching. There is much worse out there that's for sure.",Hercules
259,bigleek,"Entertaining film,worth watching.",8,4 June 2015,"Some people are pompous and to critical or try to be clever film critics when they are obviously not. The film was a fresh and entertaining as it was meant to be. And not the same as same as films of the traditional myths of hercules. And I certainly found this more enjoyable as hercules films go as did the rest of the family. So do not go by the negative and ridiculous markings and judge for yourself. You won't be disappointed. I hope there is a follow up film with the same cast, and has the same witty sense of humour as this film had..The rock, McShane were great as was the amazonian girl. John Hurt gives as always a solid performance.",Hercules
260,jrr-rogers,Quality Rock film despite lame previews,8,24 July 2014,"Saw this Thursday night, and my friend and I were well entertained. I am a bit biased because I love the rock, but I found this to be on par with his other, more popular movies. CGI was fine, despite a lot of negative vibes the previews gave off. (Saw this in 3d) Good battle scenes, music, and locations. Not as light hearted as one might expect. Most attempts at humor were somewhat poor, but the one-liners deliver. Good supporting cast, same warm fuzzy feeling all Johnson's movies provide. Movie felt a bit long, but I was never bored. If you are looking for a good summer action movie, and aren't a harsh critic, then look no further. If you are looking to critique acting skills and special effects, then you may want to pass. Movie like this are for entertaining, not winning awards!! 8/10.",Hercules

After seeing the trailer i expected to see gods, demons, super powered action. I was extremely disappointed with the false advertising of this film and all the action sequence shown in the trailer just gets over in 2 min into the film. Rest of the movie is dull and you will be left craving for action throughout the movie!. The special effects are nothing special.This movie doesn't deserve a review above a single line.I give 1/10 for it is a case of cheating, false advertising, the story of the movie is very predictable and ordinary",Hercules

Honestly she was not a good match. she clearly isn't cut out for this type of work. Swin suit model come on. Not thinking she is attractive.I thought the movie could of used some better actors for characters. the cinematography was way out there but good. Dwayne is HUGE but the tattoos are not my type of look for a guy. IN all I thought the movie had spunk and charisma. I am a war guy myself but a fan of the rock so wanted to check it out.

I thought it will be the great movie but too sad I'm disappointed. First half before intermission was not so interesting except first 15 to 20 minutes film. Second half was the worst only because of the twist that the king flipped out part. It shouldn't be mixed like they put comedy, drama, betrayal, and action. Of Course I enjoyed the action but it was not enough. I would say that filmmakers should not try to create the sequel. They would come with totally different story. Over all the movie lack of interest. It should've to be keep interested to viewers and movie lovers.",Hercules
264,cooldude-m24,this movie was just like a typical salman khan movie,4,3 August 2014,In this movie the directors need to know something about physics . I think the movie makers was too much impressed by our typical Bollywood movies of Salman khan where SALMAN khan always have some super powers whenever he kicks anyone they fly in the sky and fall 1 km far (sorry for my English here) the same thing happened here our hero hercules have some superpowers though its origin or existence was not mentioned anywhere in the film as there was a scene in the movie where he Punch's a guy and he falls after a great distance and then he come out of the chains just because he is the great hercules who is nothing but a man but still the heroine was going to die i was like what the hack is this..,Hercules
265,bayrockets17,So many things wrong with this movie,1,27 July 2014,"First review I have written. I have never been so moved to review a movie until now. I am not sure if the movie has more clichés or plot holes in it, but there are a ton of both. I would have preferred a movie just showing Hercules defeating his 12 labors. The highlight of the movie was the first 5 minutes summarizing the 12 labors Hercules faced. Instead we are given a ridiculous story of Hercules as a mercenary after his family's death. He is hired to lead an army against rebels. The reality the rebels are the good guys and he was fooled. Cliché? Ergenia, the King's daughter could have simply paid Hercules to kill her Father. That would have been a simple task, seeing as he had no army at that point. Anyway I could list a ton of issues with the movie but the biggest one I would like to point out is the appearance of King Eurystheus at the end of the movie. The man turns out to be the murderer of Hercules' family. He is nowhere in the movie at all except for one flashback which showed him briefly. Yet this ""King"" shows up at the end of the movie when Hercules is captured. So you are telling me...Sometime after returning that day from a major war and during celebrations King Eurystheus showed up to Thrace knowing that Hercules wouldn't leave with the gold? This King traveled to Thrace with just 3 murderous dogs? None of his own soldiers to protect him? What King does that?If you ignore all the plot holes you are still left with a movie without much character development or narrative at all. Honestly I had to check the character list in IMDb because I didn't know the names of any characters after watching the movie.Don't waste your money on this movie.",Hercules

It can be compared to a night of fine dining followed by a dance. I beg to differ to those who were disappointed with this beautiful movie. It was more than what I expected from the legendary Hercules character. This might be a little bit of a spoiler so Spoiler Alert!. Without spoiling much for those who have still not seen it, I was really craving to see the more 'human' side of Hercules and This movie delivered on all levels. It is a full package of entertainment. Perhaps expectations differ among the viewers. If you are expecting the mighty god like characteristics with lot of magical characters and showdowns, then this movie might not be for you. As far as my expectations go this is a solid 10/10.",Hercules
268,frodo94,"Entertaining, funny and well done.",8,10 November 2014,"Most people will try to compare this film to other titles of a similar ilk. Personally, I enjoyed it for what it is - entertaining. It doesn't take itself too seriously, the CGI is pretty cool, there are some genuinely funny LOL moments in it, and it just quite epic enough to be cool. Of course, it's a film called Hercules starring Dwayne Johnson, and I'm sure that critics and hipsters and purists will have a field day with this. However, if you are one of the few people left who just enjoy a good, entertaining film with no strings - watch this. It's refreshing to see a film not trying too hard, but still managing to keep enough quality to no make it a farce. Would recommend highly to people who just enjoy fun films.",Hercules
269,perdikos13,This is not the myth of Hercules,3,28 October 2014,"As a Greek, I was unpleasantly surprised by this film, Sure i enjoyed Dwayne Johnson's films in the past but I was more eager to watch this film especially due to the bad taste that i had from the other Hercules film that was released earlier this year. The result? Pure disappointment. Let me set some things straight right here. The thing about Greek mythology is that it is so unbelievable but at the same time so awesome. You can't think about these stuff these days. And then here comes this films and violently rapes the Greek myth about the half- god Hercules who was so kind but possessed superhuman strength an dealt with the monsters of his era. They present him as a common mortal man, just a little bit stronger who has a staff of people to present him, represent him and assist him in all his labors and acts. This totally compromises the sense of Greek Mythology. This is not Hercules. It is just a film about a team of mercenaries, one of whom is extremely strong that go around ancient Greece an fight. For example it is like filming a movie about Superman where he is just a normal guy flying in a jet-pack and wearing a bulletproof vest. Would you like to watch that? Sure but don't call it Superman. Or imagine if a film was called Spiderman and when you watched it you found out that it was about a guy wearing spandex and parkouring here and there and had nothing to do with the original concept.",Hercules
270,alexandergarcia232,"Dwayne Johnson as Hercules is not great cinema, but it is rock solid.",7,25 July 2014,"This Review is going to be short and to the point.The Positive of the Movie: The movie had better acting and visual effects compared to The Legend of Hercules. The Rock was Great as Hercules. In many ways it remains very faithful to the original myth in that it talks about this larger than life ""son of Zeus,"" who completed amazing labors. His name (albeit his Roman name yet again) is legendary all over Greece. This story helps spread and exaggerate the ""legend"" of Hercules as a major part of the plot. Hercules' nephew is a companion whose main talent is storytelling. He embellishes and tells of all his great deeds in a way that cements him as a legendary hero.The Negative of The Movie: All the 12 labor scenes you saw in the trailer where only in a brief montage, running a total of 1-2 minutes only. The movie was more about the man Hercules and not the Myth. He Isn't a demi-god, He Isn't the Son of Zeus, He Doesn't have the strength of a God, He Is just a regular mortal who became a great warrior.Overall It was enjoyable but forgettable Movie. The rock was great as Hercules and his band of mercenaries even though you don't remember their names by the end of the film were interesting because of their skills. The film reminded me a lot of the scorpion king.",Hercules

I expected another clash/wrath of the titans movie which were just meh, and in the most part it was but with better/ more interesting characters and development. the story was decent enough compared to other movies of the same type. One thing i did not like were the jokes, they were the type of ones that you think in your head are funny, but then you retell and no one laughs or just don't realize its a joke and it falls flat. yeah there were a number of those. ""the burning spear"" for example. Other than that the movie did what it was suppose to and a little bit more. i enjoyed the Rock as Hercules i though it was well cast, Hurty and the other actors were decent as well, cgi was well done and not overly as abundant as i though it was going to be. overall another easy watching-entertainment-summer-action-flick that exceeded expectations. not Oscar worthy but definitely more watchable than some of the other action flicks *cough cough tf4*Of course this is my own opinion and i will not be held liable for any money that is lost because of a disagreement of such.

274,cafeneaua-politica,a disaster movie in my opinion,2,25 July 2014,"Together with my boys and their friends, I went to the movie ""Hercules"", a blockbuster action in their acceptance (of the children), a disaster in my opinion such as an intellectual adult.I summarize me to remember that the entire film is made in the purest Hollywood minimalist concept style, full filled with demonetized clichés. I only remember from many stage, the one where the film's hero, Hercules, like any hero or epochal character of American movies, mandatory before a big confrontation, necessarily has a mobilizing speech designed to motivate fighting the barbarians, the Germans Nazis or any aliens.Then, it seemed as very miserable the effort of this film creators to present everything from an atheist perspective, with total demystification of original thread of legends of Olympus, in which is found the original legendary Hercules, reducing to zero the all influence of the supernatural, of the occult mood and destiny, making from this mainly character case, a poor neighborhood bully, which among other trifles, is learned by heart some cheap texts to impress local Geishas.It is quite obvious in recent years of American cinematography the trend to manipulate the Western without brain mass-consumers, trying atheistic to substitute an endless God with filthy of human body and spirit. That equalizes everything downside, at the end remaining nothing than form, that only shiny packaging, that wraps any marketed product from Western civilization, but one empty of any content, with substituted content, or broken content .From my maybe narrow point of view, one of a human who still consider himself a cultivated person, declare that this kind of movie is a sweet garbage, and a big waste of time & money.Take care of yourself from,""Primus Inter Pares""",Hercules
275,lbhurt,Really poorly done with every imaginable cliché trotted out and thudded across the screen.,1,26 July 2014,"I went into this movie with high expectations as I've enjoyed most of The Rock's movies and I am a huge childhood fan of Hercules (the old movies, not the Kevin Sorbo series) and I hoped this would be a return to the glory days of Hercules. Instead we have tired old cornball stereotype a la Steven Spielberg at his most nauseating with the smarmy kid, the athletic girl, the wise old cornball, the loyal dog-boy, and the capable friend. There is a suggestion of Hercules being a fraud and his ""disciples"" around him being the root of his mythic status with the little PT Barnham kid endlessly hocking everything Hercules does. The fights scenes are a couple steps back in technology as I have no idea how you could release this movie in light of the stupefying fight scenes delivered in say the ""300"" movies. The Rock wears what looks like a child's training bra for a chest-plate for nearly the entire movie despite the fact that the chest muscle rests somewhere around his collar bone. Everything about this movie is superficial, adolescent, and about the level of a low budget Saturday morning cartoon... on public television. This is career ending bad. The kind of bad that sticks to you and follows you around. Brett Ratner's feeble direction in this crap-fest succeeded tremendously in ruining everyone's career involved in it. Ishtar should thank God this movie was made as now it can rest peacefully knowing some unfortunate incompetent souls have somehow managed to save it from being the worst movie of all time.",Hercules
276,benbotto411,every other action film,5,28 July 2014,Hello chums of IMDb. Today I went to see Hercules now I had a feeling that this film would be another one of those fight em up films. It was filled with action that we had seen in other movies. Now the special effects in this film looked very low budget. (SPOILERS)The scene when the statue falls and kills lord cotys is very low budget the statue falling looks very animated and very fake.The film may contain some very low budget effects but overall good entertainment. Young children will love this film to bits because of it action scenes and fighting. Older children my find this film a drag and a bit boring,Hercules

Hercules has his family taken from him by the King he swore his oath to, a King who it turns out is in league with a rival King to take all of Greece as their own. When he finds out that he has been fighting for the wrong side, Hercules unleashes his full might.A must see summer hit, especially for fans of Dwayne Johnson.I highly recommend this movie.",Hercules

The well done seam between myth and reality was subtle, and the characters were unique and well developed. Costume design was also impressive, and the plot beat a lot of expected clichés. The issues I had with the film were very minor, small historical things. That being said, the film didn't present itself as sternly historical, and judging it as such is not a good way to interpret and go in to this film. What one should know going in to see the new Hercules is that it is a big step in the right direction for action films, mythos movies, and in a lot of ways big budget films in general.

Some positives about Hercules; It wasn't dragged out and cut straight to the plot; it did have some CGI monster sequences but overall kept the film realistic. Had some humor. The Rock and his co-stars did a good job entertaining as a team. I didn't care or didn't want to see Hercules, but I saw it anyway and was actually surprised at how good it was.

A lion jumping off a rock but one never sees Hercules fighting him. The Hydra fight scene was very brief, probably 15-20 seconds. In fact, if you saw the trailers, that is the extent of how long you saw monsters. The movie had a few funny moments but this movie was definitely over hyped. Completely predicable. The producers would have been better off staying true to the Greek story. I have seen Conan the Barbarian movies better than this movie.

There is a brief look at a few of the mythical beasts Hercules is said to have slain but the story is presented in a format that gives way to the possibility that Hercules could have been a real person.His divinity is non-existent in this movie. But it doesn't make him any less a hero. If anything it makes him more of a hero to be able to do the things he does without being the son of a god.The makers of this movie went out on a limb, took a huge risk, and in my opinion, achieved something few others are willing to even try. They showed how superstition can alter your perceptions of what you see and what you will allow yourself to believe in. They showed how willing people are to accept fantastic stories when in need of what they believe would take a miracle. This movie shows that miracles are a matter of perception and that anyone, if they believe in themselves can do great things.So yeah, if you just want action, boobs, and gods doing twisted stuff to people, this isn't the movie for you. If you like movies that make you think, with real human depth (not referring to individual characters as much as humans in general), as well as a healthy dose of violence and awesome stunts, then this may be the movie you've been waiting for.",Hercules

It reminded me a lot of Troy (which I really like by the way). I am one of those people who has a passion for ancient history warfare, and I really liked how it was portrayed here.

284,sanji06,"Great take on the Hercules story, the Rock does rock",9,14 September 2014,"Hercules was one heck of an unexpectedly well crafted ride. The movie takes a quick twist in the beginning by revealing that the classic stories of Hercules are just myths. This reveals the full cast of heroes. The story is relatively standard at the start with a sub-plot of Hercules' past. I was initially unhappy with the concept, but the movie quickly won me over by fleshing out the idea. It certainly didn't hurt that most main characters were played very well. Of course Sir Ian McKellan did an excellent job, as did the Rock. The supporting cast was good on the whole, although some of the more minor performances certainly dip. Overall, it was a fun but more engaging movie that was enjoyable from the start to finish.",Hercules
285,theioaltheio,Wrong character choice,1,7 August 2014,"Who chose Dwayne Johnson to act as Hercules. Wrong choice. I mean look at him, he is better chosen for Prince of Persia because he has the looks of a Persian warrior. He doesn't fit a Greek character. He is a good actor but putting him in a wrong characterization makes the whole thing bad. Even if the plot or the story is good but the casting does not fit the characterization, it will still end up bad. For me, the movie is not worth the 6.6 rating. Budget is high but when I watched it, it's just a lot better than a low budget film. sorry but it's my personal opinion. Make Dwayne the Prince of Persia and he will surely shine.",Hercules
286,yassinfes,I watch it is very nice,9,21 October 2014,"This is nice film i watch it you can download herehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vyNxt652jQIt doesn't ignore the back story of his wife and kids, but glosses over those parts until it becomes necessary to divulge that information. Again, i think it would have been better to see it, rather than be told what happened. I knew his history and so was wondering if they would portray this properly. Instead they do something to set-up a villain for the end which I wont give away. Just know that they do tie up all lose ends as needed, but a prior knowledge of who this character is and what he has done does help the viewer understand his motivations and his life up to this point.Its when the big war starts that you really sit up and start paying attention. Somehow watching the Rock talk doesn't interest you, but when the fighting starts with the epic 200 people battle sequences, you suddenly see where the budget went, the fights are fantastic!What is really great is how Hercules and his band of merry men (and woman) use smarts to outwit the enemy rather than simply use strength each time. That was clever. From the moment of that first fight the film moves up a notch and becomes excellent entertainment.Its a historical film and tries to be serious about its overall message. Dwayne does a good job but he's not going to win any awards for this. The other cast members actions are predictable and sufficient. But don't really add much to the plot. They could have been written out and it would have changed nothing.The running length is long enough to feel satisfied and not so long that it overstays its welcome. The plot twists you see coming a mile away but at least it tries to do them. Other than one characters actions near the end which was so obvious it was stupid to include.",Hercules
287,zaphodalive,Surprisingly good,7,31 October 2014,"A lot of people went into this movie with expectations that this would follow the mythology, and I think that's what let them down. However, as an artistic representation of not only the myths, but a possible truth behind the myths, this was an entertaining watch.I'm only vaguely familiarly with the mythology, but I know enough to know the way it was represented. This film represents that mythology in a different way - more genuinely believable, and less fantastic - but blends the original mythos in in a way I found very interesting. A lot can be forgiven for an intelligent, new look at an old story, and I don't think this film needs to be forgiven very much at all.The story was fairly well rounded with a some light/moderate complexity to it which was nice, and it was much less far-fetched than I thought it would be. The acting was - in general - excellent, with only one or two instances where I thought it was a bit too cheesy or overdone.Dwayne Johnson was fantastic; having seen him in several films I was expecting a less solemn, more caricatured, performance. But he was excellent, and I have gained a little more respect for him as a serious actor (though I wouldn't cast him outside head-bashing quite yet).Overall an underrated movie in my opinion, and definitely worth a watch if you like a good story.",Hercules
288,b1820806,Action Hero Movie with Swords and Shields...,10,1 November 2014,"This is my first review ever. I had to start because i want to give good movies justice! This Hercules movie is refreshing and a new take on Hercules. It is a TRUE hybrid take of Hercule's as a man and a ""god""...not just your typical demigod, clash of titans, gods beaming in and out, angels flying down to help... type movies. If your expecting those, you would be disappointed. Instead this takes a look of Hercules as a man (I am trying really hard not to spoil the movie here!). It is promoting good morals, that often times how we are is what we make of ourselves. It is full of action and highly entertaining and the story was decent! So if your into action, sword and board... type movies you will definitely enjoy this one. One of the better action war movies i've seen. Don't get too hung over by what your current thoughts are about Hercules and what you expect of him already. Keep an open mind and watch this movie as a hero action movie and you will enjoy it much more.As a side note... I hate critics saying things like, this Hercules movie is not good and no one has made a good enough Hercules movie thus far...well maybe your damn standards are too high. I feel like this portrayal of Hercules is one of the best one out.Hope you all enjoy it as much as i do.",Hercules
289,gs-utilities13,Actually Very Good,10,11 November 2014,It was actually pretty good. I like how Ratner is one of many new directors actually shooting in real time and real scene camera as opposed to the Green room garbage. I saw it in theaters and i bought the blue ray. The film is stunning as are the locations it was shot in. Blue Ray has loads of extras . I think an extra movies worth. The movie has lots of real action and no video game action there is a difference. All of the characters are done with extreme detail and are interesting. The film was actually too short but with the blue ray you can get the extended cut. I think a lot of money was put in this movie and it shows. But i don't think they should have released it so close to a Marvel Blockbuster. We could have used this movie in the Winter when everything was dry not in late August.

291,avamantek,awful,1,27 December 2014,"complete garbage movie, if you watch this and like it, you probably like watching Hentai. terrible movie. It was like they were making up the story while shooting the movie, and they end up killing off the best character in the damn movie, the 1 guy who doesn't open his mouth. that is good acting in my book because the rest of them were horrible. watch this movie if you dare, if anything this movie is a comedy. I'd rather watch Adam Sandler movies than this. The rock should go back to wrestling and stay there with that performance, just poor. No character progression at all, I knew this movie was kind of short for a reason, terrible movie. If you want to waste your time with such a god awful movie. If you honestly think this movie is a 6, I'm done with watching movies because I cant trust scores anymore. Lord.",Hercules
292,yhprum1985,Awful,1,30 December 2014,"Bad acting, like watching a production at the local school, slow and drawn out deaths and fight scenes. The story line is very predictable, the one liners made me vomit in my mouth a number of times, that was unpleasant. Hercules himself is not that god like, just looks like a guy who has been to the gym a lot lately, and he almost died a number of times at the hands of average solders. You should have had someone who was at least bigger than everyone else, and since when was Hercules a drunk? As for the killing of a women and her child, yuk, unnecessary. Please, dear lord, do not allow a sequel to be made. Awful, awful, awful, awful, awful.",Hercules
293,diazm1211,OK but not the best .,9,30 December 2014,"Now I know a lot of people are bashing this movie apart. Basically people are going to see this movie thinking that its following the mythology of Hercules. That's what most people were let down by,its more close the mythology but this flick is based on a comic book (I never read the comics but I know this because it was on Wikipedia,its called Hercules : The Thracian wars by Radical) The story was well paced and good, maybe goofy at sometimes but it was well put and solid.My only problems with this movie were the short run time (1hr,38 minutes) and the 3D. The runtime could have been extended so we could have more things explained in a better time frame but it had to be 98 minutes long which I thought was disappointing because I wanted to see more of the movie but I never did. I mention the 3D was bad and not too good. It was basically good at some points but not all the time and I was let down with 3D because my cousin pressured me to see it IMAX 3D the IMAX format worked well with that awesome crystal clear imagery and kickass surround sound but 3D was bad. We paid $40.00 bucks to see it in IMAX 3D besides it would be better if it was just in IMAX 2D or regular 2D. So all in all this movie is not the best but it is a good attempt from Paramount and MGM and kudos to them for that. Hell, its better than the Summit version with Kellan Lutz ewww.",Hercules
294,moviebookfangirl,Surprisingly Good,7,4 January 2015,"This is not the type of movie I would usually want to see. I have never really gotten into Greek mythology and know virtually nothing about it. The main reason I decided to rent this movie is because it starred Dwayne Johnson. In the beginning it was a bit slow because I was unfamiliar with the characters and plot and wasn't sure how it was going to go. However, as it went on it got increasingly better. The special effects were well done and the director was smart in the angels of the camera and how it all played out. The actors did a great job (especially Dwayne Johnson). While this movie is not a comedy there were several funny moments the I wasn't expecting and appreciated. The plot was easy to follow and it wasn't confusing to someone like me who knew nothing about its characters or the background of the story. Yet at the same time I think it was true to the legend and that those who love the story of Hercules will be happy with it. Overall it was very good especially for the type of movie it was. If you like Dwayne Johnson or Greek mythology I would definitely recommend it.",Hercules
295,codywinfrey,a charismatic lead can't elevate bad material,4,2 January 2016,"Other than the presence of Dwayne Johnson the acting and special effects in this movie wouldn't be out of place in a Doctor Who episode set in ancient Greece. It seems more like the low budget WWE films The Rock was in before the Fast franchise made him a star. Every decent special effect sequence teased in the trailer is essentially no more than was shown in the trailer and the movie doesn't seem sure of what it wants to do with Hercules's Origin, it plays at him being a con-man selling the idea he is Zeus's son as a lie, then has him perform feats of strength that wouldn't be out of place in a Thor movie. Every actor looks bored , I didn't think it would be good, but I thought it might be a fun silly action movie. It's just not what the trailer sold it as.",Hercules
296,viilutaja,"Not one of the greatest ""Rock"" movies but not the worst either.",5,28 July 2014,"Went to see this movie without any expectations, only what I have seen from trailers on TV and internet(which didn't impress much). And what I discovered was 1,5 hours long medium quality movie. But occasionally managed to surprise me,because it turned out to be different than in trailers. My only concern was that they showed all the storyline from the trailers but it was not a case at all. And the action was quite enjoyable. Characters had different backgrounds. Would have liked to see a moving picture stitched to the story when the Hercules companions meet-up story was told. The approach to the legend of Hercules was more realistic than ever before. That was nice surprise. But will not remember it after few weeks. My rating 5 of 10.",Hercules
297,bwfwrites,Should have been rated RS,1,21 May 2016,"For Really Stupid. I pulled this up on Amazon Prime to have something to go with my Friday night bowl of buttered popcorn. There was more substance in my popcorn than in this movie.Dwayne Johnson should stick to comedy. This movie had a thin, predictable plot and shallow performances that were inevitable due to a weak script. I should have known better than to waste my time watching it--unlike the sword-and-sandal epics of the 1950s and 60s, this was pretty much aimed at an audience with the collective IQ of a swarm of lobotomized houseflies. Other than all of the gratuitous violence, there really wasn't much for this movie to hang its hat on. This makes the cornball ""Legend of Hercules"" look like high cinema. Maybe they should have hired Kevin Sorbo instead of ""The Rock.""",Hercules
298,catchmekillme-29048,Great popcorn flick!,8,4 July 2019,"Seeing The Rock do what he does best as the Demi-god hero Hercules! This isn't an Oscar worthy film which the cast and crew are acutely aware of!
This is just one BIG FUN movie! You'll cheer for Hercules and boo the bad guys!
Dwayne Johnson is the perfect actor to mutter lines like ""Do I look afraid?"" While staring into the camera while basically winking at his audience.
If you want fun and excitement this movie is for you!",Hercules
299,dilipdell,End Credit 3D Awesome..!!,6,28 April 2021,The 3D pictures on the end credit at the end of this movie are great.It had very good 3D animation. Great end credit animation i ever see.,Hercules

Complete crap.",Hercules
301,fc_candido,"Not that incredible, but not necessary bad.",7,1 December 2017,"Hercules is a movie all about expectations. Based on the trailer and the promotional material, it easy to assume that the movie would be about the classic story of Hercules doing his twelve labors, but this hope is rapidly broken in the movie's first minutes, which show that the myths are just lies or exaggerations spread by Hercules and his mercenary friends to benefit themselves by getting easy gold and inspiring fear. Because of that, the movie subverts what is expected from a mythological movie and transforms itself in quite a surprise. I personally enjoyed this initial twist, but I can understand the disappointment of someone that went to the theaters expecting Hercules to beat some monsters. Apart from the subversion of the premise of a normal mythological movie, like Disney's Hercules animation (which treats supernatural beings as a part of its universe), Hercules is not quite different from a conventional action movie like Fast and Furious. It has fighting scenes and, in the end, what matters is friends trusting in each other. A good part of the movie is just about The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) being The Rock, an incredible strong guy that likes to show his muscles and always does the right thing when it matters, but in this movie especially he does not see any problem in lying to get money, though. During the movie, the question about what is fiction or not is raised, just to leave the conclusion cloudy as to whether supernatural powers are something real or not in its narrative universe. Doing this in the end bothered me because it is possible to understand the movie as a generic movie in which the protagonist has super human strength and that simply negates its initial subversion of the genre of mythological movies. In addition, the most prominent message that the film brings is that narratives can be dangerous, and that they can be used to control people's opinion of an oppressor as someone good. Therefore, we need to have more sides to a history than just one and we cannot trust everything that we are told. It a good message to bring in a blockbuster movie that at seems quite unpretentious, especially in 2014, when we were not so immersed in this post-truth era of politics. In conclusion, the movie is just OK. It has an interesting premise and it is packed with enough action and comedy to be fun and bring some kind of message at the same time. It will not blow your mind, but it will certainly provide you, your friends and some popcorn with a good time.",Hercules
302,jmitchellpowers,OK,6,26 July 2018,"Mr. Johnson is always great. There were so many other stars in the cast that I can't believe it was under my radar until it hit TV. One of my issues with the movie is the depiction of the Thracians: They were portrayed as half-naked painted barbarians with battle cries that sounded like zombies. Also, they seemed to be wielding Egyptian khopeshes instead of their traditional rhomphaias. Finally, where were the Thracians' horses, for which they were known?",Hercules
