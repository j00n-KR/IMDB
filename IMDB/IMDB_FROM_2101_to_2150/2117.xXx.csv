0,Leofwine_draca,Dumb action vehicle that works quite well despite the stupidity,6,6 December 2016,"A brain-dead exercise in OTT action, lacking in wit, style, and intelligence. Yet not without a certain moronic charm to recommend it. xXx is basically FAST AND FURIOUS director Rob Cohen's take on the whole spy/Bond sub-genre, in much the same style as his car-racing flick: big, loud, obnoxious, and obnoxiously smug, thinking itself to be the hippest, most stylish offering yet, when in fact it offers the same tired clichés and obvious paper-thin plot and situations. It starts off relatively well, with bizarre situations (a fake diner hold-up) and a particularly unlikable leading man, the rude and charmless Xander Cage who does dumb things like parachute from a car falling off a bridge. After a little while, and a change of location to Prague, things become typically dumb: Cage breaks into the baddies' inner circle, falls in love, gets found out, then lots of people shoot each other until the film finishes. Hmm.It does look good, with great locations and a budget which is able to convincingly portray the special effects in a good light. But the action is fast, yes, furious, no, most of it being unconvincing in the extreme, yet not in a good way like one of those zany kung fu flicks. They're in it for the fun, this tries to be realistic, it doesn't work. There are outrageous stunts – Cage's trick with the dinner tray, for instance, and plenty of big-bucks OTT explosions and even avalanches. There are admittedly some bits that work (I liked the exploding flying motorbike shot, so shoot me) and it certainly seems fast-paced with little drag. The cast, too, keeps it interesting: Diesel's lunk is still different enough to be worth a watch, whether just to hear his latest big-headed wisecrack; Euro-villain Marton Csokas is pretty charismatic, and a few stalwarts show up like Danny Trejo and Samuel L. Jackson, playing riffs on routine characterisations. The hot Asia Argento is also present, and her appearance may be enough to make male viewers watch it; there's something so base and low about her here that she's a character hard to resist – some might say Dario's greatest offspring (or is that SUSPIRIA)? So, all in all, not badtypical, but enough stuff to keep watching.",xXx
1,SnoopyStyle,stupider version of a Bond movie but Vin Diesel has his charms,6,18 May 2014,"Xander Cage (Vin Diesel) is an adrenaline junkie and exhibitionist with an attitude. He causes chaos for the sake of his underground agenda. NSA Agent Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) arrests Xander and recruits him to infiltrate the organization of gangster Yorgi (Marton Csokas). He has the background and the attitude to fit in and best of all, he's expendable. Yelena (Asia Argento) is Yorgi's girl assistant. The action is from an inferior Bond movie. The story is convoluted. This is basically paying homage to Bond. At least lots of things blow up. Vin Diesel does have the charisma even if his acting is strictly functional. He shows that he could be a good action hero. He just needs to find the right franchise. This is flashy without the right substance. That seems to be the trademark of director Rob Cohen. There is too much stupidity going on. I don't really like the eurotrash motif. However there are just enough good stuff here to see this as escapist fun.",xXx
2,Horst_In_Translation,"Diesel's rise to stardom continues, but sadly the film's level is not on par",4,26 January 2017,"""xXx"" is an American movie from 2002, so it has its 15th anniversary this year. Fittingly for this anniversary, they made the third entry to this series recently and the lead actor is once again Vin Diesel. He has worked together with director Rob Cohen on several occasions, such as the very first ""The Fast and the Furious"". And now you also know what to expect here. This one here is the epitome of a pretty pointless action movie. It is about an extreme sports athlete who gets recruited by the government to go on a very dangerous secret mission. And honestly, this mission and the story around it are just not enough for two hours in terms of quality. Even I as a fan of Samuel L. Jackson must say that his generic character cannot really elevate the material here. It is all as expected. Diesel's character of course easily gets all his missions done, even if they try to make it look hard and he also always makes a cool statement afterwards, which may work on the first two or three occasions, but gets repetitive and try-hard relatively quickly. The only scene I somewhat liked was when they were at this restaurant and the girl (of course Diesel's character takes care of the bad guy's lover) gets informed that somebody is aiming at them. This was a pretty tense scene because Diesel for once has to go out of his comfort zone, but everything (before and) afterwards is just one action sequence following the next, at the very end also in the snow. And about Jackson's character making jokes how it's just a test all the time and the real mission is yet to come. Oh well, maybe it finally did in this recent release.Back to this one here, you can easily identify the filmmaker's intention to turn this into something deeper than pointless action, but I just don't feel they had the talent and this is also what people say about his other works sometimes. Here, one example would be the scene when he recognizes the woman's boots and how Jackson's character explains it all afterwards. And of course Diesel's character is also the one cracking jokes with the other guys in the plane, so we see what a cool, likable alpha male he is, not scared of attacking that one other agent all the time, the one we are supposed to consider unlikable, but I personally did not really like Diesel's character either. Occasionally, they try to throw in Bond references, like when he says what he has to do for his country before going to bed with a hot chick, but yeah, it all just feels funny for the sake of it and not really creative or authentic. This is a perfect example of a movie with which one film is one too many already and let's not even talk discuss sequels, but the success with audiences resulted in it actually becoming really successful (not with critics though) and that's why even 1.5 decades later still new films are being made. I personally give this one here a thumbs-down though. Not recommended.",xXx
3,Prismark10,Cage in a rage,6,6 February 2014,"Fast and Furious director and star (Rob Cohen and Vin Diesel) reunite to take on the world of espionage.From an early moment we see a spy infiltrate enemy territory and then reveals himself in a tuxedo. The spy is soon out of sorts when he has to blend in during a metal concert.Blending in as the new century arrives is not a problem for Xander Cage. A big muscular, tattooed extreme sports addict. He has been recruited by Samuel Jackson doing an early Nick Fury impersonation to go on a mission and do his bit for the Stars and Stripes.The plot involves renegade Russian anarchists who want to destroy major cities by way of biological weapons and install a new world order. The group has already been infiltrated by Russian agents and unite with xXx to take out the bad guys and weapon.The plot is indeed pure James Bond with its European setting but Diesel does not cut it as a super-spy. Extreme sports addicts might enjoy Diesel trying to out ski an avalanche.The film is also too long, it needed to be tighter, the bad guys are unmemorable and as the years since this film has shown. Bond is still the name you know as Diesel bailed out for the sequel.",xXx
4,kosmasp,Bond he ain't,4,20 May 2007,"Not that the movie tried back then to be like a Bond movie. It tried to update the spy movie/myth into the modern day. The key word being tried. In my eyes it never achieves that goal and I do like Vin Diesel (although more his Pitch Black character or his recent ""Find me guilty"" movie)! That this isn't the greatest action movie, that has been established by others here before. There's not much story here, but that can be forgiven, because it's an action movie! But where it really fails, is the sometimes bad choreography of the action scenes. And that is something that cannot be forgiven or overlooked. Especially a motorcycle stunt is edited so badly it nearly made me sick! So all the updated spy things (character, gadgets and so fourth) are thrown away at the end ...",xXx
5,gavin6942,Extreme Fun,7,21 December 2015,"An extreme sports athlete, Xander Cage (Vin Diesel), is recruited by the government on a special mission.I wish I didn't like this film. I mean, I'm not typically someone who goes for over-the-top action films. I like the cheesy 1980s ones from Cannon and all that, but I am not huge into the fast cars and all that. And that, this film won me over.Most likely it had something to do with the metal aesthetic. Opening with a Rammstein concert, flames and all, definitely caught my attention. And then you cast Asia Argento? Good choice. She had a few good years and this was probably one of them...",xXx
6,lee_eisenberg,the things Vin Diesel's gonna do for his country: act in silly movies,5,15 July 2005,"""xXx"" is basically another ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"". Xander Cage (Vin Diesel) is a muscle man hired by the government to be a secret agent. He goes around kicking booty and falls for Russian agent Yelena (Asia Argento).I guess that there's nothing wrong with the movie, per se. It's pretty fun, albeit improbable. It's just that I wouldn't recommend it to you as your first choice. I gotta ask: is Vin Diesel ever going to act in anything other than movies that have him flexing his muscles? Actually, he did star in ""Saving Private Ryan"". And of course, Asia Argento's father Dario is a famous horror movie director.",xXx
7,jboothmillard,xXx,4,19 March 2012,"I had always heard about this high action film because of the two leading stars, and it is an easy title to remember, but I had never actually seen it, so I was definitely interested to, from director Rob Cohen (Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story, DragonHeart, The Fast and the Furious, The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor). Basically the US government have a list of people with criminal records and special skills who qualify as perfect for a special mission, and National Security Agent Augustus Eugene Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) has chosen who he thinks is the best of them. Xander 'X' Cage (Vin Diesel) is an extreme sportsman, notorious underground thrill seeker and sure fire adrenaline junkie, his attitude stinks so naturally he has no interest in Gibbons's proposal, but he is forced with the possibility of facing prison. His mission is to enter a world of crime and gather information about an Eastern European underground organisation called Anarchy 99, that others have failed to infiltrate, they are apparently trying to destroy the world. The group is led by Russia ex-soldier Yorgi (Marton Csokas) who has a grudge against authority and society in general, and obviously world politics, so naturally he wants to rid the world of it completely. X, or 'XXX' (Triple X) is getting closer to the villain via his apparent girlfriend Yelena (Asia Argento), and of course his no sense of fear of danger attitude, as well as his determination to get through situations come in very handy to defeat the enemy and save the day. Also starring Michael Roof as Agent Toby Lee Shavers, Danny Trejo as El Jefe, Richy Müller as Milan Sova, Tom Everett as Senator Dick Hotchkiss, The Karate Kid Part III's Thomas Ian Griffith as Agent Jim McGrath and ""Let Me Blow Ya Mind"" rapper Eve as J.J. Diesel obviously got his action man status from this film, after having many small parts, and he is relatively alright with his gruff demeanour, and Jackson does alright as his scar faced mentor, it is admittedly a rip off of James Bond and an excuse for just as many explosions, big landscapes and big stunts, but it doesn't try and grip you with a decent enough plot, but overall it is not a terrible spy action thriller. It was nominated the Razzie for Most Flatulent Teen-Targeted Movie. Okay!",xXx
8,ccthemovieman-1,Diesel Is Decent As Latest Macho-Hero,7,21 September 2006,"Vin Diesel is a pretty good guy to play these new action-heroes. Like ""The Rock,"" he's a big, muscular macho guy who men can look upon with some respect and the ladies can fall for. Unfortunately, a number of these testosterone-filled action films, including this one, are somewhat moronic in nature. However, they are undeniably entertaining.You can always depend on one thing in these type of movies, from the ""biker movies"" of the '50s to today's films: the hero will always be a rebel against authority and any laws of the land. Also, an even more-recent theme is to have the government actually employ the rebel to get the job done because their men are unable to accomplish what this ultra-tattooed macho man can do! It's so much garbage, but it has its moments and Diesel still is a likable hero of sorts. Like Arnold Schwarzenegger before him, and Steven Seagal, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Chuck Norris and then ""The Rock,"" these kind of muscle-men have fairly clean mouths and at least some ideals. For pure action, the movie succeeds because, in the end, it does entertain which is the name of the game.",xXx
9,Tweekums,Mindless fun,7,17 September 2009,"I hadn't seen this film before yesterday but when I looked through the television guide it looked like the least bad thing on. I'm rather glad I decided to watch it as it was quite fun. Sure the plot was sub-Bond and Vin Diesel is hardly the worlds greatest actor... he does however do what is required in a film like this.Vin Diesel plays extreme sports junkie Xander Cage who is recruited by the US security services when their own agents keep getting killed on a mission to infiltrate a group calling themselves Anarchy 99. As one would expect with such a film the group has an evil purpose, in this case to poison millions of people with a binary nerve gas.The plot is really just an excuse to show a series of dramatic stunts including parachuting from a car as it goes over a bridge parapet, doing spectacular motorcycle stunts while being shot at from helicopters and snowboarding in front of an avalanche. We also get Bond-style gadgets including a multi-purpose gun, binoculars that can see through walls and high explosives disguised as sticking plasters.If you want a couple of hours of mindless fun with great stunts and spectacular explosions then check this out. While Xander Cage will never challenge James Bond in the spy thriller stakes xXx is more entertaining than certain Bond films... there is no CGI surfing here.",xXx
10,ma-cortes,"Unstopped action-packed, violence and overwhelming scenarios",6,11 February 2008,"This blockbuster concerns about Xander Cage, a macho-man with natural athletic abilities, he's an extreme-sports expert. When he is by force recruited by NSA agent Gibbons(Samuel L. Jackson) for dangerous mission and as avoid going to jail but he has some problems with the law . Xander can succeed where other US Government agents have failed. He must to go underground Praga and infiltrate as undercover agent into Russian ring called Anarchy 99, led by a ruthless mobster(Marton Csokas) who uses nuclear weapons. Xander Cage must combat a cruel enemy far beyond his possibilities, he's only helped by a gorgeous girl(Asia Argento). Furthermore, Xander is supplied with technological arms by an agent(Michael Roof), similar to Q-James Bond.The film contains high-energy action, noisy thrills, struggles, emotion and spectacular scenes. It's over-the-top action movie plenty of explosions, firepower, gun-play and breathtaking pursuits as when a motorcycle runs afoul with bounds and leaps. The picture is stirring and exciting, though also a routine actioner with no much sense. Tough Diesel as one army man is cool, he's co-executive producer. Lively musical score by Randy Edelman , adding hard rock, heavy metal and disco-music. The film is produced with high budget by Neal H. Moritz, an action movies producer and usual of Rob Cohen movies. Cohen is a nice director of hits, such as ¨Stealth, Fast and furious, Daylight, Skulls, Dragonheart¨ among others. It's followed by an inferior sequel starred by Ice Cube and again with Samuel L Jackson and directed by Lee Tamahori.",xXx
11,Quinoa1984,A true action pic stylized for its audience (teens),5,13 August 2002,"Much of XXX can be seen as a homage to the James Bond franchise, we have the gadgets the stunts the M and Q characters, just a less suave attitude with Vin Diesel than with a Connery or Brosnan.  Here, Diesel is a stunt man sort of, and has three strikes against him, until Gibbons (Jackson) comes forth and brings him an opportunity to serve his country.  He agrees, since it gets him out of jail, and it pits him against a group called Anarchy 99 (the Vandals reference is nice amidst the usual clunk of dialogue. Nothing people haven't seen before; the stunts especially are one degree from going into parody ala Austin Powers territory.  But it's kept at just the safest enough level and it can be seen that a lot of work went into these stunts and effects in these action scenes.  Exciting, as long as you don't ponder it after it's over.  B+",xXx
12,wes-connors,yYy,4,26 August 2011,"Because he is such a gnarly dude, the Unites States government puts muscular criminal Vin Diesel (as Xander ""xXx"" Cage) on the payroll as a secret agent. After passing some tough guy tests administered by superior scar-faced agent Samuel L. Jackson (as Eugene Gibbons), Mr. Diesel is sent to the Czech Republic to befriend, but really fight against anarchistic accented Marton Csokas (as Yorgi), who throws a great party. Secretive girlfriend Asia Argento (as Yelena) is an important distraction. If you like fast cars, bikes and explosions with your dirty, dangerous and tattooed Diesel, this film is for you.**** xXx (8/9/02) Rob Cohen ~ Vin Diesel, Samuel L.

13,BandSAboutMovies,Hot Topic Bond,5,10 April 2020,"After The Fast and the Furious, Rob Cohen and Vin Diesel teamed up again to create this James Bond for the 2000's. Xander Cage is a stuntman and X-Sports loving rebel who gets hired by the NSA to infiltrate a gang of Russian terrorists named Anarchy 99, who have acquired a biochemical weapon called Silent Night.Seriously, this movie couldn't be more 2000's if it was filmed inside a Hot Topic while everyone was wearing JNCO jeans.NSA Agent Augustus Gibbons (Samuel Jackson) offers Cage a deal. He'll clean his criminal record if he joins up and stops the Russian group.Seeing as how this is a 2000's movie, of course Danny Trejo shows up as a criminal. Asia Argento shows up as Yelena, a Russian undercover agent who falls for Xander. There are also plenty of cameos, like Eve, Rammstein, Tony Hawk, Mike Vallely, Carey Hart, Matt Hoffman and Buckcherry singer Josh Todd. Seriously, this movie is so 2000's that it tastes like Surge.The film immediately sends up Bond by having a version of him - Agent Jim McGrath (played by Thomas Ian Griffith, who was Jan Valek in John Carpenter's Vampires) - get killed off before the action begins.As much fun as I've made of this movie for being dated - just check out VIn's fur coat - the Bond movies probably feel the same way for some people. Oh well - any movie with Asia in it is worth watching, right?",xXx
14,michaelRokeefe,No kidding! A secret agent?,2,5 July 2003,"Adrenaline-charged combustion. Full throttled maximum volume action.

15,hitchcockthelegend,"Bang bang, fire fire.",7,18 June 2009,"xXx is directed by Rob Cohen and written by Rich Wilkes. It stars Vin Diesel, Asia Argento, Marton Csokas, Samuel L. Jackson & William Hope. It's shot mostly in Prague with Dean Semler on photography and Randy Edelman scores the music.Underground adrenaline sports hero Xander Cage has fractured just one too many laws. The secret service, in desperate need of agents tough enough to complete the most hazardous of missions, have Xander under threat of prison, something he can avoid if he gets to Prague and infiltrates Anarchy 99 and foil their fiendish terrorist plot.You can just imagine the meeting of minds at the lunch table for discussion on xXx. Right, so it looks like the James Bond franchise is heading downwards again, and this up coming Bourne thingy probably wont have any legs. Look guys, I really think there is a market opening for a kick ass secret agent movie. Lets get beefcake man mountain Vin Diesel to star, set it in a quality location, maybe Prague, and let all hell break loose. Slot in a foxy chick like Asia Argento to stir the loins of the thrash metal Satan worshippers, and put in a crazy Bondian villain intent on making the world implode.You know what? They went ahead and did it. Made for $70 million the film, in spite of divisive reviews, went on to make over $270 million Worldwide. The out shot is that xXx is just over two hours of disposable, unadulterated, explosive action fun. 6.5/10",xXx
16,Theo Robertson,Bond Deconstruction,4,27 February 2005,"This starts with a man wearing a tux getting killed by some Slavic gangsters at a Nu-Metal gig . It's never mentioned on screen but the implication is that the dead man is Bond, James Bond and throughout the movie where treated to an alternative universe where the world is no longer saved by sophisticated suave secret agents but saved by a loud crass extreme sports loving American Did I use the word "" treated "" in the above paragraph ? Maybe that's too much of a strong word because XXX isn't much of a treat . Okay I disagree with many of the people claiming this was the worst movie of 2002 but Rob Cohen is a very shallow director while Vin Diesel is a laughably bad actor who makes Sylvester Stallone look like Anthony Hopkins in comparison . What compounds this problem is the amount of homage the movie pays to the Bond series . Isn't this movie trying to do away with Bond ? So why does Xander Cage borrow lines like "" The things I do for my country "" which sounds a lot like "" The things I do for England "" from YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE . all throughout the movie we're treated ( Again that's maybe not the right word ) to little nods and winks to Fleming's superhero which makes the movie end up being a 21st century homage to JB and I doubt if this was the original intension . The story structure mirrors that of the franchise of cramming in several different locations because it seemed like a good idea at the time , so much so you find yourself forgetting what the original plot was , there's a femme fatale and the bad guy wants to start effectively world war three . Seen it all before XXX is dumb , loud and spectacular when it needed some wit and a better leading man . If your only requirement in a movie is stunts and explosions you'll no doubt enjoy it but I do prefer substance in a movie",xXx
17,CinemaSerf,"""Tha Saint"" in a sheepskin coat...",6,27 July 2020,"Vin Diesel is actually quite good in this as an adventurer who manages, frequently, to wind up US law enforcement by causing mischief and mayhem against those he thinks deserving of exposure. When NSA agent ""Gibbons"" (Samuel L. Jackson) arranges for him and his team to be dumped in the Czech Republic they have a choice - infiltrate a ruthless gang of Russian hoodlums bent on world domination or... go to jail. Initially, the team think it's all an hoax but as it becomes clear that they actually are in a real scenario it all starts to heat up. Diesel has bags of charisma, attitude and muscle on screen, for this. Sure, it's not new nor will the writing and dialogue cause you to need a dictionary (unless you are about seven years old) but as action films go, it is perfectly watchable with plenty of car chases, pyrotechnics and gadgets.",xXx
18,poolandrews,"""The next time you send someone to save the world make sure they like it the way it is."" Decent if shallow action film.",5,7 May 2010,"xXx (or 'Triple X' as it's said) starts in Prague as an undercover US agent is killed by members of an organisation who call themselves Anarchy 99. Meanwhile in the US extreme sports internet superstar Xander Cage (Vin Diesel) steals a senator's car & drives it off a very high bridge (filmed at the Foresthill Bridge in Auburn which is the tallest bridge in California) in protest to the senator's views, Xander is caught & NSA agent Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) offers him a deal in which Xander either goes to prison for the rest of his life or accepts the job of going to Prague & infiltrating Anarchy 99. Xander has gain the trust of Anarchy 99's leader, a former Russian soldier named Yorgi (Marton Csokas) who intends to detonate bombs of a deadly chemical virus called Silent Night over several major capital cities & killing millions. Xander has to stop him & his plan & uses his extreme sports skills to stay alive & defeat Anarchy 99...Directed by Rob Cohen this big budget action film is a mix of James Bond spy adventure with a bit of Léon (1994) & Die Hard (1989) thrown in there to give it a bit of an edge & a mainstream teen appeal, while not a bad film xXx isn't anything special. The whole plot is lifted from a James Bond film, the evil organisation with some madman at the helm who has devised some elaborate over complicated scheme that threatens the entire world. Here in xXx the gimmick is that the man sent in to stop the world threatening plan is an anti-authority extreme sports enthusiast who has an attitude problem to start with but soon comes round as he becomes your typical action hero fairly quickly, sure his extreme sports skills lead to some cool action scenes but dramatically speaking it has zero impact on the story (except that bad guy's trust Xander because they have seen him on the internet, yeah right). The angle in which a Government agency hires a criminal to do their dirty work is also unoriginal & the basic plot is rather absurd. Why does Yorgi want to kill so many people? Sure he has some speech about making the world free but what's in it for him & why kill millions to achieve it? Also what's to stop him being killed by the virus? He never indicates he has antidote, does he? xXx also has questionable morality, the opening sequence seems to say that video-games & rock music are great but then Xander has a running gag with a bad guy about his smoking & that it'll kill him. The character's are poor, Xander is far too one dimensional while the bad guy Yorgi is given virtually no motivation or background at all & the twist that Yelena is a Russian spy seems to have had little though behind it as it never amounts to anything significant. At over two hours in length it's a bit long but it does move along at a decent pace & there's plenty of action & eye candy here, sure xXx isn't deep or meaningful or even makes much sense (a solar powered submarine?) when you think about it but it does have a certain entertainment value.One good aspect of xXx are the action scenes which shine, from motorbikes jumping over exploding barns to jumping through barb wire to out snowboarding an avalanche to shoot-outs, to explosions, to para-sailing to car chases to driving cars off bridges to water-skiing a submarine xXx delivers on the action front. Apparently a stunt man was killed during the filming of one of the para-sailing scenes during a second take. Like the James Bond films themselves agent Xander Cage gets a Q like gadget man who gives him various things like x-ray binoculars & a fully loaded car that Bond would be proud to drive himself. While it's nicely shot & the stunts & effects are impressive the soundtrack is often awful, I hate loud rock music at the best of times & xXx certainly isn't the best of times if you know what I mean.Shot in 82 days on a supposed budget of $85,000,000 this was filmed in California, Austria & Prague. The acting isn't great, Vin Diesel is OK, Samuel L. Jackson is always watchable while Asia Argento is very attractive & makes for a hot love interest.xXx is a decent action film, it's rather brainless & has little to no plot worth mentioning but the action, stunts, the odd amusing one-liner & gorgeous Asia Argento keeps it watchable if nothing else. Followed by xXx: State of the Union (2005) & soon to followed by xXx: The Return of Xander Cage (2011) which is currently filming as I type this.",xXx
19,lastliberal,"If you want someone to save the world, make sure it's someone who likes the world as it is.",6,15 August 2007,"Yes, I know that this movie is a little over the top, but it qualifies as one of those guilty pleasures we visit from time to time when we want mindless entertainment. In that sense, it excels.I was just looking for a Danny Trejo fix until Machete comes out and found this and Nightstalker. Trejo was only in this for a short time as the Columbian Army swept in and blew everything up. That's OK, it satisfied me for a while. During that raid, we got to see some of the best stunt work with a vehicle as drivers maneuver motorcycles around exploding buildings. During this stunt, helicopters fire at the motorcycles, a motorcycle jumps an exploding vehicle, a stunt driver on a motorcycle jumps through barbed wire and a stunt man jumps over barn as it explodes behind him. AWESOME! This movie features action sequences and sound work that makes the best Bond movie seem tame. You see a stunt man harpoon a moving boat while in a car traveling parallel to the boat. Using a parachute, the stuntman attaches himself to the moving boat and flies behind it. As a bridge approaches, the stunt man unhooks himself from the parachute harness and slides down into the boat. You also see a stunt man drive a Corvette off a bridge and escapes the inevitable crash by parachuting off the car and gliding to safety.Lots of explosions, shootings, fantastic Bond-type equipment, and a great GTO.So, Vin Diesel will probably not win any awards outside of MTV, Blockbuster, or Teen Choice, but he is fun to watch.And Asia Argento, daughter of the famed Dario Argento, has been thrilling us ever since she burst out of her bra as a topless seventeen-year-old in Trauma (directed by her father). We get a little nip slip here (don't want to upset the teenies), but nothing like her skintastic performance in Scarlet Diva, the movie she wrote, directed, and starred in.I also got a Samuel L. Jackson fix that will hold me until I can catch Black Snake Moan.All-in-all a good night.",xXx
20,zardoz-13,"Watching ""XXX"" is the cinematic equivalent of chomping a giant, greasy, triple-decker cheeseburger.",8,10 July 2007,"Brawny, bald-headed, baritone-voiced, tough-guy Vin Diesel radiates the kind of charisma and presence reminiscent of the late Telly Savalas. Savalas made a career out of playing notorious villains, most memorably arch-foe Ernst Stavro Blofeld in the 007 classic ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" (1969), until he won TV fame as the lollipop-licking N.Y.P.D. Detective ""Kojak""(1973-78), who popularized the phrase ""Who loves ya, baby?"" Like Savalas, Diesel usually portrays villains, but his morally-ambiguous rogues heroically redeem themselves in thrillers like ""Pitch Black"" (2000), ""The Fast and the Furious"" (2001), and if it gets released in October, the long-overdue Mafia melodrama ""Knockabout Guys"" (2001). When he isn't cast as a bad-guy-gone-good, Diesel has provided the voice for the misunderstood monster in ""The Iron Giant"" (1999) and aroused sympathy as a doomed G.I. in Steven Spielberg's overrated, below-average, World War II bloodbath ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998). Instead of signing up for the ""Furious"" sequel, Diesel has teamed up with director Rob Cohen, who called the shots on ""Furious,"" to produce ""xXx,"" a superficial, slam-bang, European-lensed spy saga in the tradition of James Bond but aimed primarily at the PlayStation generation. Although it lacks the originality of ""Furious,"" ""xXx"" compensates for its formulaic flaws with high-voltage pyrotechnics, unbelievable stunts, and a sadistic ex-Soviet officer with a scheme to topple all status quo governments. The hopelessly derivative screenplay by Rich Wilkes, whose credits include ""The Jerky Boys,"" ""The Stoned Age,"" and ""Airheads,"" plunders the Bond franchise but pays homage to ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""The Third Man."" Diesel flexes his tattooed biceps as Xander Cage, an anti- smoking activist/outlaw Internet celebrity who risks his neck with extreme-sports escapades like stealing a right-wing California state senator's Corvette. Cage rigs the ride with crash- proof Sony cameras, so he can broadcast the footage later on-line and rebut the senator's campaign to ban rap music, skateboards, and videogames. Plunging the car off a high-rise bridge, Cage bails out with a parachute at the last minute before a fireball explosion obliterates the vehicle. Inevitably, the cops catch up with him. In swaggers National Security Agency honcho Augustus Gibbons (the incomparable Samuel L. Jackson with a facial scar like Play-Doh and a Velco-looking wig) who cuts a deal with Cage and packs him off to Prague. Xander penetrates a plug-ugly posse of perpetrators known as 'Anarchy 99.' Led by Yorgi (New Zealand actor Marton Csoka who played Celeborn in ""The Lord of the Rings"") and his cold-as-ice concubine Yelena (sexy Asia Argento, renowned Italian horror movie maestro Dario Argento's daughter), these nefarious nihilists party hardy with German metal band Rammstein when they aren't assembling a hydrofoil sub to deploy their biological weapon named 'Silent Night.' Director Rob Cohen shrewdly shuns subtlety in ""xXx"" for the sake of super-charged sensationalism. This invigorating but uninspired PG-13 rated epic features a gratuitous number of superbly-choreographed car chases, acrobatic motorcycle antics, and ear- splitting gunplay, along with several obvious anti-substance abuse messages. Watching ""xXx"" is the cinematic equivalent of chomping a giant, greasy, triple-decker cheeseburger.",xXx

22,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Brings new meaning to the term 'insulting to the viewers intelligence',1,4 May 2005,"Values change over time. A hundred years ago, you were happy if you could live past the age of thirty and had someone you liked to spend your time with. Until recently, you expected an action film to be more than a muscled guy spouting poor one-liners and blowing stuff up. Well, I guess that would be recently meaning up to the early 80's... but this is really setting a new standard, breaking all limits and going through the bottom and setting a whole new low. When did movies get this damn loud? I had to turn down the volume before the opening title appeared on the screen. Before I proceed with this review, I must give you an example of just how bad it is, try to give you an idea of it. About three minutes into the film, a guy(who is *clearly* a secret agent, and clearly meant to die right away) runs through a crowded dance floor, knowing he's been spotted. Instead of trying to disappear in the crowd(come on, nobody does that anymore... right? I mean, it wouldn't do anything... not even throw off the orientation of whoever is chasing him and give the sniper aiming at him a run for his money), he jumps up on the stage... making himself the most obvious freaking target ever. So what happens? He gets shot. Big surprise. Yeah, but what happens next? He falls backwards into the crowds' hands, who treat him like he was stage-diving...(backwards... unmoving... with a big, red spot on the front of his suit... honestly, how much does the film-makers expect us to swallow?) No, seriously. At that point(well, actually even before that) I knew that the movie I was about to see wouldn't have any value or serve as anything even remotely interesting. It's not even a decent time-killer... I've stared at spots that were far more exciting than the fake, clearly orchestrated action. I've seen drunks and stoners that were more coordinated than the gun hit placements in this film. The plot makes no conceivable sense. The pacing is so far off that I'm surprised I didn't fall asleep a few minutes(not to say it wasn't a struggle). The acting is horrendous, with one or two possible exceptions. One thing I want to make perfectly clear; Vin Diesel is NOT one of those exceptions. Vin Diesel... what kind of a damn name is that? You don't have to be a genius to figure out it's a fake name(oh, sorry, an 'artistic' name... please). You want to know his real name? Check his biography. No, wait, I'll make it even easier; I'll tell you. It's Mark Vincent. Now doesn't that just sound cool? No? Well, apparently Mark didn't think so either. What's that? He was convinced that he wouldn't be popular with that name? Well, Schwarzenegger didn't change his name. Neither did Van Damme. They seem popular enough... right? The truth is, Mark is just a poser... he's just another muscled guy who can't act but who is attractive to the girls(god only knows what they find so damn amazing by that brainless jock). He spends half of the movie talking about how it's bull that video-games and violent movies corrupt the American youth, and you can't help but think about what he says... and realize it's true. He's the one corrupting them, he and anyone else responsible for this movie and any other of its kind. All this talk of anarchy and the general 'screw you' attitude towards any form of authority... seriously, it's like they're trying hard to turn kids against parents, teachers and cops. Isn't America sufficiently plagued with young criminals? And what the hell is up with the thoroughly misogynistic way of presenting female characters? Just about all of them are whores and generally just there to please the men. No protests, no 'I'm better than this stuff' attitude anywhere... they just accept that women are made to serve men, and nothing else. The one female character who isn't ""giving it away for free"" as my favorite character ever, Dr. Cox of the TV show Scrubs would put it, is still a hooker. I think her exact words are 'I could be your girl instead of his(the bad guy's)... if you would pay me as much as he does'. OK, so maybe she isn't really a prostitute... but she falls head over heels over Mark, after knowing him for very little time. Finally, I'd just like to say that the effects are generally horrid, the action is dull, derivative and lacking in any imagination or creativity and the weapon/gadgets usually work as a huge tease. Being the big lover of weapons that I am, I was a tad excited when Mark was handed what has to be one of the biggest damn hand-cannons seen on film. Imagine my disappointment when the sap barely uses it at all. The same goes for gadgets(less important, but still). Also, near the end, Mark gets to drive a bad-ass car with a trunk-load(literally) of destructive hardware... and it's only used for having the typical 'there must be something here we can use/oh what does this button do then' scene. The characters are all stereotypes and clichés, with Mark being the guy who saves the world because he has muscles, a low vocabulary, a ridiculous accent and some poor one-liners, Asia being the girl who falls in love with Mark for no apparent reason, the geek who gives Mark his gadgets(I won't bother to change his name). Eve even shows up, seemingly just to tell off a video game producer... because Mark won't 'sell out'. Whatever the hell that means. Wouldn't someone fighting for video-games be honored or consider it a victory to have his own game? I recommend this only to fans of Mark as well as mindless teenagers with no conception of how the real world works. If you're still not sure, yes, I do hate Mark Vincent/Vin Diesel. I really do. 1/10",xXx
23,view_and_review,Vin Diesel filling the Sly/Arnold void,6,29 April 2007,"If the script writers could have gotten away with mere grunts for dialog, they would have done it. This movie took the very testosterone laden approach of action, a hot chick, more action, juvenile dialogue, and more action.Vin Diesel is quickly becoming the Stallonenegger of the 21st century. Even though I don't think he is foreign or has a severe speech impediment, he still is given nothing more than one dimensional characters with monosyllabic lines. Apparently it works because XXX and ""Fast and Furious"" both raked in a lot of cash. Still, this extreme action movie wasn't that captivating to me.",xXx
24,anaconda-40658,It Deserves 3 X's All Over It.,2,1 September 2015,"XXX (2002): Dir: Rob Cohen / Cast: Vin Diesel, Asia Argento, Samuel L. Jackson, Eve, Danny Trejo: Vin Diesel has three X's tattooed on the back of his neck as if he could actually read them back there. He is a daredevil stunt person of impressionable ability who commits illegal acts. Once caught he is visited by Samuel L. Jackson who is scarred on one side of his face. Why this information is needed is beyond me but Diesel is sent on a mission in return for a pardon. Lame plot consists of numerous action scenes to place violence throughout as much of the film as possible. Directed by Rob Cohen who previously directed Diesel in the equally stupid The Fast and the Furious. The production is fine but that is about as far as compliments go with this sh*t. Diesel is typecast as this implausible hero who makes narrow escapes and kicks the crap out of everyone. Asia Argento is lifeless as his potential sidekick and romantic interest who can also kick the crap out of everyone. Jackson is perhaps the most laughable appearing with that stupid scar on his face. Eve also makes an appearance although it can be assured that it will likely do nothing to further her acting career. Action and violence at its most over the top render this one of the stupidest action films of the year. The only purpose this film serves is to reveal that filmmakers have too much money to waste. It should be met with a big black X. Score: 2 / 10",xXx
25,FlashCallahan,get me out of the Xander zone....,4,6 May 2013,"Xander Cage is a thrill seeker who until now has been untouchable by the law. NSA Agent Gibbons forces Cage to cooperate with the government to infiltrate an underground Russian crime ring and avoid going to prison. Betting he can succeed where other conventional spies have failed, Gibbons sends Cage to enter this world of crime undetected, using his natural athletic prowess and a whole lot of attitude. Enlisted for a dangerous covert mission, he must combat a ruthless enemy far beyond the scope of his experience....When this film was first released in 2002, I was blown away by the whole proceedings. The music was good, the clothes were cool, and the set pieces were pretty top too. And it had the added bonus of Jackson doing what he does best.Ten years later, the film just doesn't hold up. The clothes are awful, and the one thing you realise is that Diesel cannot act to save his life, and seeing him spout out turgid one-liners is embarrassing, and I was bought up in the eighties.This chap was supposed to be the next big thing, and after this, the only movies that he can carry are ones beginning with fast and ending in furious.The action scenes are still ample, but I really got fed up quickly at the slow motion and waiting for literally six or seven edits and cuts, before a vehicle landed on the ground following an explosion.I can honestly say that anyone who loved it back then and are in their thirties, go back, see it and wonder why you enjoyed it.It's a real dud, that goes on for too long and relies on beautiful women and pyrotechnics to entertain.",xXx
26,Aaron1375,Just could not get into this movie,3,22 October 2018,"I watched this film a few weeks ago while at my fiance's house. I had never really had an urge to watch it, but it was only fair that I let her pick out the film so she picked this one. Suffice to say, I was not a fan of this film as a film that boldly titles itself XXX should be way more over the top in certain areas. Basically, it should not be a PG-13 rated movie and should contain nudity and over the top violence. This one pushes the envelope for a PG-13 movie, but with the title being the highest rating attainable it should be pressing closer to a NC-17 rating! I do realize you cannot try to get the XXX rating as then it would be a hardcore adult movie, which still probably would have been better than this mindless drek.The story, heck I barely remember it! All I know is that the film starts out with a James Bond type agent being killed by these guys so that makes Samuel Jackson decide an extreme sports star with no training is the best bet to get this super bad guys. Of course, the soon to be agent is going to be Vin Diesel seeing how he is the star, so he goes over to Russia to buy some cars making this almost feel like a Fast and Furious film. He falls in love and has to stop missiles and he is going to load up a car with every weapon in the book and the filmmakers promptly have him not even use the car's many gadgets! Okay, he uses one or two, but what is the point of introducing said spy car if he isn't even going to have a freaking cool chase with it?So this film tries to be a counter to James Bond, but fails. I wouldn't trust anyone who wore that fur coat Vin Diesel was wearing to making my fries, let alone save the world. Vin Diesel is just Vin Diesel here, he is pretty much the same guy he was in The Fast and the Furious only he is going extreme sports which he does not look like the type. He fit right in Furious, cause I see him behind the wheel of a muscle car, on a skateboard or something, not so much. Samuel Jackson is pretty entertaining though, but that is nothing new.So in the end, as I expected, I did not care for this movie at all. Totally unmemorable, the action is just meh, no nudity because they give the XXX title to a PG-13 film, hell, if they were going to do that why not make it a G then it would have been a touch ironic. They would go on to make two more sequels, but neither scored big at the box office so this one would not become the franchise Fast and Furious would become, not even close.",xXx

Turning down big money for the awful Fast and Furious 2 for this film pumps up his career.  The role is perfect for him and is marketed for the Y gen crowd. The sticker skateboarding is a crime is a dead give away.  The film is entertaining, and cheesy all in one; you'll see with that boat thing.

33,ThomasDrufke,Welcome to the Xander Zone,6,17 January 2017,"If any future filmmakers are looking for inspiration in the guilty- pleasure high octane action genre, xXx is exactly the film to look into. What's not to like about it? Heck, even the horribly awful things are entertaining.Back when Vin Diesel decided not to come back to the Fast & Furious franchise, he chose to join F&F 1 director Rob Cohen in taking on another ridiculous action extravaganza, xXx. Now, the Fast & Furious franchise has figured out the right balance of lighthearted humor, bada** action sequences, and developed characters who we actually care about. xXx certainly has fun action, but that's about it. The humor is there, but in no way do I believe it's intentionally funny. And the characters are pretty awful. Or, at least the dialogue coming out of their mouths is awful.But does a film like this really need to have great dialogue? I guess not. Especially when it contains countless one-liners that do nothing but put a smile on my face from ear to ear. Essentially, this is just another Fast & Furious movie. Fast cars, explosions, women in scantily clad attire, incoherent plots, over-the-top villains, and catchy music. All are staples of the franchise, and Xander Cage's first film outing is no different. The supporting characters are fittingly absurd and bizarre, led by a prototypical performance from Samuel L. Jackson & an equally clichéd turn from Marton Csokas. I think the bottom line is, this movie is so far-fetched and insane that it works as one of the best mindless action adventures of the last decade. No one would believe a guy like Xander Cage would be recruited as an undercover agent in any sort of organization, but that's not really the point. xXx sets out to entertain, and that it does.+One-liners+Full-throttle action+Over-the-top-Really, really awful dialogue-Cliched -Does anyone actually care about these characters?6.4/10",xXx

There's action galore and incredible stunts. The photography and visuals are fantastic, and the action sequences amazingly well done. This is a James Bond wannabe, with more action. 'xXx' is loud, noisy and vibrant.The premise might not be all that logical, and what the fancy cars had to do with anything I still don't understand (apart from making it look like another Fast and the Furious movie...). The humor is just a tad to much, making this more of an action comedy than action thriller like the Bond movies.If it's action you're looking for, 'xXx' will satisfy your every need.

36,Floated2,Predictable yet very entertaining,7,12 October 2010,"xXx is a very entertaining and fun thrill ride with a lot of great action scenes. The plot is rather simple and predictable but thats the worst of its worries. For an action-packed, brain-dead testosterone fest, I have to admit Rob Cohen's xXx isn't that bad. I remember hearing mixed reviews about the film and I wanted to see how it was for myself. Though the script is full of the most corny of action dialogue, and the story is as epic in its unlikelihood as any Bond picture could be, but I think that's the point. The fiery explosions, the unmitigated villainy, the stunts, the gadgets—it's all so gleefully over-the-top. The film starts off pretty good, drags a little in the then gets a little better towards the ending. Though the first hour is its best.Script-wise, the film is less impressive. You're desperate for Vin to bust out the cool one-liners at every stage of the movie, but the best he can manage is ""I told you smoking would kill you!"" (yes, kids, there's a MESSAGE here), or, worse, ""If you're going to send someone to save the world, make sure they like it the way it is"". There's also ""Oh, the things Im going to do for my country..."" Overall the film was great as entertainment and brainless fun but could have had a better story",xXx

He must infiltrate a ruthless, international, untouchable and powerful underground gang who are suspected of having in their possession, some biological components which they plan to unleash upon an unsuspecting world.

Anarchy 99 aim is world domination and planned to use chemical weapons to destroy the world's major cities. The dialogue of the film was bad and there is no subtly. It is just a show of explosions and shooting battles where the bad guys can't seem to shot straight. It isn't even trying to be comedic which at least True Lies try to do (I'm not a fan of that film either). It seem to be an attack on Bond type films, but it didn't work. It was just aimed at 14-year-old boys and having extreme stunts and unrealistic events such as riding on a mission in the middle of the river Vltava. This sort of film would have had a short shelve life and will not last. It could not build a franchise and most people would outgrow this sort of movie.I remember when it was released that there was some talk that Vin Diesel was considered to be a potential Bond, and I was thinking what the hell are you one. Die Another Day tried to be more action based and be more unbelievable. The director of that film, Lee Tamahori, ended up directing the sequel.

I'm guessing just because of how low his voice is. Anyway, Mr. Diesel hasn't played any ordinary characters, at least ones that involve a major role. Pitch Black (2000) and The Fast and the Furious (2001) were the films that propelled him to where he is now, but both characters had abilities that allowed them to be almost superhuman. Here, Diesel plays just a very skilled professional.Vin Diesel plays Xander Cage, a popular stunt artist who believes that the majority of the government's laws don't apply to him. It is because of this attitude that he carries, that makes other ""civilized"" people not so fond of him. However, there is one person who finds Cage to be quite beneficial to the US government. His name is Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) and he's got a proposal for Cage. If Cage can infiltrate an evil Russian crew and obtain important information, Gibbons will make Cage's problems go away. Sweet, so in other words, Cage will become a spy! So to become a spy he needs a nickname - how about triple X (xXx) because he has three X's on the back of his neck? That works. It's almost like a new name for the spy genre. Instead of 007, its xXx. Is it appropriate to the character - yes. But honestly, will anyone really find this memorable? I guess some would. It depends on your opinion of the character. Rich Wilkes, the writer of this movie does make the character of Xander Cage likable. It's just odd how he writes the story in a fashion that makes it sound like hiring uncivilized people to do civilized jobs are okay. I mean, sure it's okay if every person who doesn't like authority was like Xander Cage. Why? Because Xander Cage does have moments of character development.But to honestly think that a plan like that could work? I don't know. Anyway, the acting is good. Vin Diesel puts a good performance for a guy who only knows how to be a spy for literally a week (that's what he says). Jackson also is convincing as Cage's boss. In fact, Diesel and Jackson exchange some funny lines with each other so it works. On the flip side, I wasn't charmed by any of the antagonists. Martin Csokas as the main villain is one the most unlikable characters there. Sure he makes himself a good villain but villains can have charm too. There is no charm with this man. His attitude towards society makes Xander Cage's attitude look like fluffy pillows.As for action goes, there is a lot of it. But it feels brain dead every now and then, which can get tiresome. Adding to that is the musical soundtrack. Various artists sound themselves through the film but if you're not a fan of heavy metal or at least heavy rock, you as a viewer will have a hard time enjoying the film because it does come up quite a bit. As for the musical score, it does have a main theme and is effective during sentimental moments too. The composer, Randy Edelman is not a novice to this kind of genre so I have no complaints with how he composed his music. However, I do wish it was more frequent in the movie. The actual soundtrack containing various artists seemed more dominant. Other than that, it's a decent action flick with enough Diesel to fuel your interest. Just expect anything too clever.Vin Diesel does his best to be the next generation of the spy genre but the movie plays big, loud and stupid at times. Not to mention that the villain has nothing to be liked about. It's not all bad, but it could have been better.",xXx
46,Easygoer10,Not Very Good,5,11 October 2019,"First off, I am no Vin Diesel fan. For example, almost all he ever wears are ""wife-beater"" sleeveless tees. On the other hand, I really like Marty Csokas. He is a truly brilliant actor. Besides that, this film is all action, but the plot is woeful. Skip it.",xXx
47,Rob_Taylor,All in all it's a pretty standard action adventure.,6,18 December 2002,"This could have been a very good film, but its just too damn much of the same old spy-action-stuff that we've been deluged with due to the Bond films. I know it was designed to be a clone of the Bond films, an affectionate fun-poking, so to speak. But it did it really have to stick so closely to the formula? I mean, they even had a ""Q"" character.Vin Diesel carries the film, of course, as was intended. But whilst this movie will not harm his box-office appeal in the slightest, it's also not really stretching him at all. Neither did Fast and Furious, for that matter. He's capable of a lot more. I just hope he doesn't end up getting sucked into the Hollywood ""no-brainer action-hero"" role. That would be a terrible shame.Samuel L Jackson, likewise, hasn't much to do in this film.All in all it's a pretty standard action adventure with a charismatic leading man and lots of gadgets and special effects. Funny in places, and enjoyable enough if you just want to be entertained for a couple of hours without having to think at all.",xXx
48,eric262003,Formula Taken From The James Bond,8,26 April 2010,"The dynamics of this the movie ""xXx"" is that director Rob Cohen must have been following the style and formula of spy hero and icon James Bond. Though it is bombarded by the clichés of the typical Hollywood spy story, Cohen carries the film a little further by adding the heart-pumping excitement of extreme sports to the mix. James Bond, move over, and let Xander Cage (Vin Diesel) take over. ""xXx"" is more quicker, clever and entertaining than any of the Bond movies come together.Though it may not come to grips with political correctness, it paints a satisfying picture of modern machismo. Xander Cage who uses the nickname XXX, has similar intensity as Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone, but actually comes off as being more clever in his dialogue. True Xander oozes with the stereotypical laden clichés depicted by action heroes before him, defying death, philandering with the ladies, damaging properties to save others from ruthless baddies and driving cool cars and carrying studly gadgets. The James Bond that we've known especially from the sixties often lured ladies and were often viewed as pawns to be saved and for the her4o to look good while saving the day. And to have some fun with them in the process. ""xXx"" is different that it goes beyond the surface of an average action flick. One of these days people will say that Rob Cohen has successfully resurrected a near dormant genre as it comes across as a case study self-identification. But the action is what everybody is truly wanting to see and...who could blame them?",xXx
49,Gislef,"Stunts A+, Acting C-",6,12 August 2002,"When XXX focuses on the action sequences, it does pretty well. Van Diesel's physical work is good, they blend him (as opposed to his stunt doubles) into the sequences pretty well, and the movie has just enough outlandish Bond-style stunts to work. The only thing odd is that the movie almost treats Diesel himself as a extreme sports star. Ever seen Gymkata? It's kind like that, where they set up Van Diesel to ""Do something that spotlights your XTreme Sport Talent of parachuting/skateboarding/skiing/whatever"". Except...Diesel doesn't have any such talents (as opposed to the guy in Gymkata who did). Weird.When it comes to something besides action and one-liners, Van Diesel doesn't quite have it. His chemistry with Asia Argento (also good) is not very good, and he looks like a fish during his romance scenes. He also doesn't really capture the ""Uncaring anarchist-type guy who learns to care when confronted by real anarchists! vibe that the movie requires of him.Samuel Jackson is okay, the techno-geek is okay, and everyone else is...passable but forgettable. There are some odd filming and story decisions. The villain gets killed off prior to the climax, which leaves it curiously flat. The big build-up to the high-tech super-car is somewhat of a let down: Xander doesn't _use_ any of its capabilities. And for some reason the director felt obliged to intercut a high-volume super-fast chase sequence with shots of low-volume couples kissing and children playing - I guess to capture the pathos of what is going to be destroyed. Totally disrupts the flow.Overall a good fast-action low-brainer kinda flick. It's basically a star vehicle for Van Diesel, and I'd like to see him succeed. But he needs to get in a little more work before he can pull it off entirely.",xXx
50,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""xXx"" is dumb fun that kind-of, sort-of works for the most part... Certainly, a good rental...",7,20 September 2009,"From director Rob Cohen (""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story""; ""The Fast and the Furious"") comes the insane-o 2002 action spectacle ""xXx"" (""triple x""), staring Vin Diesel and the beautiful Asia Argento.Xander Cage (Diesel) is a daredevil who is wanted by the police for a number of charges, all relating to his awe-inspiring (but very illegal) stunt-work. A memorable introduction for the character involves him stealing a car from a mean spirited, uber-conservative sleaze and driving it off a bridge, while he leaps to safety with a parachute as friends record it from the sidelines.At the same time, NSA Agent Augustus Gibbons (my favorite actor of all time, Samuel L. Jackson) is dealing with the loss of an agent looking for a mysterious computer chip in the Czech Republic. He decides to try a new initiative- sending in a new kind of undercover agent, one who isn't a trained operative, but rather is a real civilian with real street-smarts. And so, he lands on Xander.After Gibbons abducts Xander and places him into a few tests of will, smarts and physicality, Xander accepts the responsibility to infiltrate the mysterious Criminal Organization Anarchy 99, where he must stop their leader from making a deadly biological attack.The film is basically an MTV version of James Bond... rather than being suave, Xander's edgy... Rather than intricate gadgets, he's got a whole mess of guns and explosives... Rather than being charming, Xander is blunt but cool. Etc. Although it is hard not to notice the James Bond influence... Xander's got his own version of M, his own version of Q (in that he has a gadget-guy)... his own bond girl (in Argento's character, the presumable girlfriend of the villain). And the movie's very loose plot line is vaguely Bond-esquire.The acting is par for the most part. Diesel is a lot of fun to watch, and Argento and Jackson deliver decent performances. The supporting cast, mainly the villains, are very cliché but work.Rob Cohen's direction is really what elevates this film. While character development isn't really writer Rich Wilkes strong point here, he does supply Cohen and Diesel with enough spectacles to make this worth watching for the action alone. Cohen's guidance of the camera and actors in the many intricate action set-pieces and beats is impressive, and I'm willing to say that a scene involving a motorcycle chase during a drug-raid in Columbia is flat-out one of the best action-sequences I've ever seen.I guess it boils down to this... the film is a big, bloated silly piece of moronic fluff. But it is most certainly a very entertaining piece of big, bloated, silly, moronic fluff. I loved it when it first came out (when I was about 14) and I still enjoy watching it from time-to-time, at the age of 21. And I most certainly will see any new sequels involving Diesel's character in theaters. (I skipped the first sequel, ""xXx: State of the Union"", because it was the bad kind of fluff, where even the fluff went stale, and also most of the characters were replaced for no real reason.) Overall, I'm giving ""xXx"" a 7 out of 10. It's silly, but vastly entertaining. If you're in the mood for a light thrill-ride, then I'll guide you with our hero's catch-phrase- ""Welcome to the Xander-Zone!"" Aka, see ""xXx"".",xXx

The look and the music is really not comparative to the classics of James Bond movies. The hardrock soundtrack is very bad. Please don´t insert again such bad music in XXX2. Okay there were many actions scenes and special effects but they are far away from the ones we see in James Bond films. The avalanche scene was very realistic but the mountain chase was also similar to James Bond. Last but not least the audio sound was not clear enough on DVD.You may think now why I compare this film always with James Bond movies? The answer is very simple: XXX is a charmless copy of James Bond. That´s it. Anyway worth seeing. 7/10.",xXx
52,denis888,"XXX  A Good Film? No, A Collection Of Goofs",1,10 September 2007,"There are good and bad films. Some are good in everything. Some are terribly bad. Some are funny, so their badness is not that terrible. Some are so dead serious that they become simply unbearable. But then, there are films that are nothing but a collection of hilarious goofs. XXX is one of those. No, let us be fair, Vin Diesel is a good actor, and here, he together with Samuel Jackson, try their best to save this quagmire of banalities and clumsy ideas. But they fail. The heavy lead weight of despicable cleavages and silly mistakes just draw this movie deep down. Well, the plot is trite to the last limit, so it is not worth retelling, but several obvious goofs and certain mistakes are obligatory to be mentioned. 1. When Vin's hero, XXX, is landing with a parachute after he exploded the read Corvette, we can see that on his neck there is no XXX tattoo, although, next moment, it does reappear. 2. FSB is an organization in Russia, which is concerned about internal affairs, so an agent of FSB will never be sent to any country like Czech Republic to work under cover. The American equivalent will be FBI, which is not connected with the activities like in the film. Moreover, FSB never let its agents be neglected. Even in the wild 90's it retained its high status. 3. The very idea that everything bad in both Europe and this world is done by bad Serbs is old, trite, banal, beaten and certainly not true. All Bosnian and Albanian atrocities aside, we should say that using the same old song about bad Serbs again and again is not funny and simply betrays the lack of ideas and good taste. But then, in Hollywood, seems like nobody even realizes where Serbia is and what the whole war was about. 4. The whole film again shows the certain pro-Democrat and anti-Republican sentiment. But, yes, this is Hollywood and in the films here the USA is shown like a creeping fascist regime, where people (even criminals) may be thrown into some drug-trafficking country and become the targets of some extremely brutal experience. This is funny, unreal and obviously shows off its libertarian origins. Finally, when will it be enough to make films in Prague? As if there are no other cities in Europe. Prague is nice, but as Ringo Starr once quipped, too many cakes will result in diabetes. Thankfully, Vin did not agree to participate in XXX 2. That one was enough.",xXx
53,Terryfan,Welcome to the Xander zone,8,21 May 2015,"I remember in high school a lot of students were talking about this movie xXx. Staring Vin Diesel, Samuel L Jackson, Asia Argento, among others.Just watching this film after so long of not seeing it made me think about how much my view point of it has change back then I enjoy it and I still do today but it's not a perfect film.Then again it wasn't set up to be that way but still don't think I'm bashing the film no sir no ma'am I'm not. I enjoy the film it just has been so long until a few months ago that I just watch it again to see how it holds up today.The story of the film features Vin Diesel plays Xander Cage an Adrenaline junkie who ends up getting the attention of Agent Augustus Gibbons of the NSA who recruits Cage for a job to become a spy for him.The Soundtrack of the film has a mix of metal and hip hop songs featuring Gavin Rossdale, Drowning Pool,Nelly, N.E.R.D., Queen of the Stone Age and much more. The theme of the film is ""Adrenaline"" by Gavin Rossdale which in it own right match the film and the character of Xander Cage so good job by the music department to pick this song as the film theme.What is the driving factor of the film is the action and stunts are pretty much out of this world. Some stunts almost think that was impossible for them to pull it off. But sure enough it was very well done which is enough to keep your interest. Some of the cast could have been do with out but Vin did well as the anti hero of the film since he wasn't intend to being in the mess in the first place but he was in it non the less.Some of the characters could have been better off not making it onto the film but what can you say about it but still I found the film to be enjoyable.With great stunts, tight soundtrack it's enough to enjoy the filmI give xXx an 8 out of 10",xXx

Yorgi has a biological device and intends on releasing it in highly populated areas. When Gibbons tells Cage to back down and go home, he refuses and tries to stop Yorgi.

59,PatrynXX,On track to become Moonraker 2.,5,5 January 2003,"(spoilers?)I am a big fan of the James Bond series.  But spy movies in general are quite fun to watch.  xXx is just way to stupid.  It's similar to Moonraker in this fact.  The villan is as stupid as the idiot in Moonraker and actually the villan in Moonraker would have killed this guy long ago. The villan is an absolute moron.Other complains: Sound editing is poor.  The sound effects during the concert parts were overpowering.  The music is muffled.  Bad combination. Kept thinking something was wrong with my speakers when Rammestein came on at the beginning.The plot is disjointed.  I'm not sure if there is any plot holes, but the plot is choppy.  It skips around.  Not totally explaining anything.Vin Diesel isn't horribly bad in the movie, but he ain't good as always.
And let's face it, this is Sony's revenge against MGM to losing out on getting their own 007.  And frankly, it's a good thing MGM won that. Because this would have ruined the series more than Die Another Day. It also came into the same problems people complain about Bond.  It isn't violent or sexy enough in today's society.  My copy I got from Blockbuster had a deleted scene called Girls.  They blurred em out on the bed. Someone was obviously peddling to the wrong group of people here.  More than likely... Teens.  This movie desperately wanted an R rating.  Which probably would have made the movie much better than the crap that came out.5/10

61,sarastro7,A bit of a cult classic,8,12 October 2004,"I went to see this movie two years ago with the expectation of a modern American-style James Bond action-adventure. I was quite disappointed, at first. But now I think the movie has aged very well. It has a cool style, and Asia Argento makes it *very* much worth watching.While there are dumb things and bad performances in it, the movie *also* contains good things and some very serious performances. The overall plot may be ridiculous, but a lot of the individual scenes strike me as very realistic and believable.I strongly doubt the sequel will live up to the first. The first movie is on the road to becoming a cult classic; it has all the requisite things: jokes, seriousness, sarcasm, irreverence, intensity, wild action, attractive characters. Even a hell-bent anti-establishment attitude. In fact, the only weak parts are some of the ridiculously evil bad guys, and a bad climax. But hey, most cult classics have pretty bad climaxes.I first rated this movie 6 out of 10, but I've subsequently had to make an upward modification to 8. It deserves it.",xXx
62,mentalcritic,It accomplished what it set out to do...,7,1 October 2004,"As the Bond franchise has worn on past its use-by date with not a fresh or new idea in sight, it should hardly be surprising that competition on the espionage-based action-adventure front is emerging. And to be quite frank, the competition doesn't exactly have a tough field to fight on. Three of the last four Bond films have been utter tripe, with the most recent in particular an utter embarrassment in the face of this upstart. Even Licence To Kill isn't all that interesting compared to some of the recent cloak and dagger superheroes we've seen in film or otherwise.XXX succeeds where Bond has failed by setting aside any conventions about class or preening, and getting right back into the guts of what a visual medium should be about. Deisel's Xander Cage doesn't expect the viewer to be impressed by overused dialogue. Instead, he communicates through a relative economy of words and lets his actions do most of the talking. The gadgets or stunt skills demonstrated in early parts of the film have a purpose later on in the story.It is this latter point where XXX utterly caned Bond 20. In XXX, we see our hero steal a car from the kind of man anyone who grew up during the 1970s or 1980s would love to stick on a pole and drive it off a bridge. While the snowboarding sequence crossed the line between extreme and ridiculous, Vin Deisel makes this work because he looks, sounds, and even generally acts the part. After Bond 20's ""See? I can be X-TREME too!"" opening, it's no wonder that rumours are persistent that Pierce Brosnan will not be coming back.But to get away from the Bond/XXX comparisons for a second, let's look at what this film was trying to accomplish. You can have all the extreme sports conventions and secret agent plots in the world, but it is all for naught if you don't entertain your audience. In that sense, XXX works by diving right into the Indiana Jones style of action, setting a pace that gives the viewer little, if any time to consider the improbabilities of the situation. Which is one area that any action film thrives upon - if you give your audience time to think about what they've just seen and how probable it is, you're dead in the water.Going back to comparisons between XXX and Bond for a second, it seems a fixture of this kind of series to have improbable women with improbable personalities doing (comparatively) mildly improbable things. If the action is only as good as the main antagonist, then the dialogue and interpersonal relationships are only as good as the leading woman. XXX has Asia Argento. The last five Bond films have had Halle Berry, Sophie Marceau, Teri Hatcher, Izabella Scorupco, and Carey Lowell. Rosamund Pike and Famke Janssen notwithstanding, I rest my case in this department.Getting away from that overworked comparison again, I am definitely not a XXX zealot. There are numerous problems with the film that become obvious when you look past the surface. None of the characters have anything remotely resembling a third dimension, and many of them don't even approach a second. As previously hinted, some of the stunts are so ridiculous that they almost undo the film. Even when your pace is so fast that you're not giving the audience time to think, you can't just openly defy the laws of physics. A hero narrowly dodging bullets, an audience will accept. A hero running from the centre of a nuclear explosion (or an avalanche) past the edge without the aid of a miracle, they won't.Unfortunately, it seems that XXX is destined not to become even a two-episode franchise. Deisel has already left the series, and the same director who helmed Bond 20 looks set to direct episode two. A two-punch knockout, in other words. Given that XXX is firmly rooted in the time it was made, however, that's probably a good thing. In all, I gave it a seven out of ten. Jump in expecting merely to be entertained, and you can't go wrong.",xXx

Not enough pleasure.,3,10 August 2002,"From Rob Cohen (director of ""The Fast and the Furious"") comes another mindless action vehicle that caters to those who fry their brains all day with Playstation and Nintendo 64.  Unless you're a sucker for elaborate stunts, there's nothing to see here.  How the hell do they come to the conclusion that XXX is the Bond for the new generation?  If that's the case, then I'm going back in time.  Screw that!Sean Connery...Roger Moore...Pierce Brosnan...Vin Diesel???  Comparing XXX to 007?  What the hell are you thinking?  How do you go from ""Shaken, not stirred"" to ""I live for this s**t""?After hearing Vin Diesel's inspiring story on ""Jay Leno"" about his early attempts to become an independent filmmaker, I decided ""What the hell? I'll give this guy a chance,"" totally shrugging off his horrible performance in ""Fast and Furious.""  And what do I get?  Another horrible performance. Vin maintains the same conceited, I'm-the-man expression throughout the entire film.  It gets extremely annoying at times.  He tries to sell every line he delivers, as if he's waiting for applause from the audience.  I thought the whole idea of XXX is he's a RELUCTANT secret agent.  That would've been a great premise.  He's having a ball!  Vin doesn't even have nearly as much charisma as a Sean Connery or Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan.  He's just another muscular body.  The women will most probably swoon, but that's not saying much.  The cool thing about most action heroes is that women love him and guys want to be him.  Well, I don't wanna be a damn thing like this moron.The acting, with the exception of Samuel L. Jackson and the beautiful woman who plays Vin's love interest, is horrible.  The dialogue is beyond horrible.  The music is cool but, like in ""Fast and Furious,"" often mismatched with each scene.  Basically, Cohen thought to himself, ""Young people are watching this movie.  I'll just insert a hit song wherever possible.""Even guilty pleasures require a certain degree of wit.  This movie doesn't contain anything that even resembles wit.  If you're 18 and under with the attention span of a 2-year-old, you'll have a blast.  But if not, please avoid this disaster of a movie.

64,fmarkland32,A poser...,1,19 July 2007,"This is the movie that made me indeed hate Vin Diesel and label the worst action star ever and his vehicle is a prime example of what is wrong with the genre of action that I love so much. Vin Diesel stars as Xander, a would be rebel who is recruited by the CIA (Or someone big) to infiltrate a terrorist unit and then singlehandedly saves the world while getting the girl. XXX is a would be update for James Bond, and as such this proves an extreme arrogance to the audience. Basically the movie tells us that XXX is a rebel without a cause, a anti-establishment type who is needed because James Bond is outdated. (Hence the opening where a James Bond style spy is killed in a rave.) This is the message throughout, what makes this atrocity against mankind so laughable is just how derivative of the Bond formula. The gadgets, the girls, the super bad guys with elaborate plans, the skiing stunts (Okay Snowboards now, oooh!) and indeed the name is all borrowed from Bond. (Indeed, not sure if anyone has brought this up but XXX is actually the name of Bond's love interest in The Spy Who Loved Me) So with such derivative material, I suppose a watchable movie could've been made. Too bad that XXX represents a third rate Michael Bay movie, with appallingly soulless action, unexciting villains and a hero so dense that one can't believe such a worthless movie was thought of as a good idea for the man shooting it through his camera. Worst of all there is no edge, Diesel has less action star charisma than even Jeff Speakman (Although Diesel does play anti-heroes well.) and basically this movie is hopeless. Watch a real Bond movie for the real thing, don't watch this poser.As far as action flicks go, working your way down from Schwarzenegger to Diesel, is almost as much of a valley as working our way from heavy metal to emo.

66,jon.h.ochiai,Agent Extreme,8,12 August 2002,"Director Rob Cohen's ""XXX"" starring Vin Diesel is both an extreme departure from and an homage to James Bond. XXX is long over due as a Gen X version of a secret agent-- in your face, smash mouth, aloof, heavy metal, extreme action. The concept is very edgy. Give writer, Rich Wilkes, some props.Mysterious Agent Gibbon (Samuel L. Jackson) recruits Extreme Sports Star, Xander Cage (Vin Diesel), as an NSA agent. Actually, Gibbons extorts Xander Cage into serving his country-- either that or jail. The NSA needs to send an operative into Prague to infiltrate a group of anarchists lead by Yogi (Marton Csokas). As Gibbons puts it ""We want to send a snake into the snake pit... not a mouse."" The action is extreme, probably breaks every law of physics, but it is fun. That is the operative thing-- fun. Diesel as Cage is truly the new paradigm of the secret agent. He is anti-social, buff, tattooed, self-interested, and smart. The funniest scene in the movie occurs when Cage reveals to Yoge's girlfriend, Yelena (well played by Asia Argento), that he is a secret agent for the U.S. government. She says ""No, you're not."", and proceeds to laugh. XXX never takes itself seriously, and has a sense of humor. Rich Wilkes's idea is great, the story is routine, and the one liner's for Diesel for the most part work. Vin Diesel is a movie star. He is charismatic, has a great voice, and a lot of attitude. He plays Cage right-- we get a sense under all the tough guy, lone hero stuff he really cares. XXX is a fun movie. Vin Diesel is going to be a major action star.",xXx
67,carbuff,"This is an ad for Red Bull, isn't it?",8,10 May 2015,"This isn't really a film, rather a bunch of ""Xtreme"" sports stunts strung together under the pretense of a modern souped-up James Bond- style storyline. It's basically really, really dumb with plot holes so large that they might as well have driven the stunt cars through them, but then, that's par for the course with this kind of movie. It's chock full of all kinds of gear, weapons, vehicles and improbable physical feats. I have no idea of how many blanks were fired filming this for my entertainment, but I really wouldn't be surprised if it were upwards of a quarter million, given the two hour runtime and the prolific use of automatic weapons. Still, as long as you accept it for what it is, it keeps moving and holds together pretty well, although the particular examples of ""Xtreme"" action showcased in this film (and I use that term loosely) date this production pretty obviously to the early naughts.",xXx
68,ivo-cobra8,An adrenaline-action-junkie fantastic my all time favorite Vin Diesel film,9,27 August 2017,"What can I say about this movie that was already said? It is my favorite Vin Diesel film and I think it is a really good adrenaline- action junkie fantastic film in my opinion! I love this film and I can say it is better than all 3 Riddick films that I am so sick of those films Vin Diesel is doing today. xXx is my favorite Vin Diesel movie alongside with The Fast and the Furious franchise.I had this movie on 2 CD's in 2004 that was 2 years later after this film was released and I have enjoyed it so much it brings so many memories. I bought a computer in 2004 it was my first and my good friend and neighbor bring me some movies on CD's in which was this movie on 2 CD's xXx (2002). Every day I watched this movie it was a blast action film and I love it. I just recently bought xXx Blu-ray 15th Anniversary Edition alongside with xXx: State of the Union and the new movie xXx: Return of Xander Cage on Blu-ray. I have enjoy all 3 films but this one? Is my personal all time favorite adrenaline spy action-junkie film.I have enjoyed this film and everyone from the cast did a wonderful job this movie does not imitate James Bond but it is his own film. Vin Diesel did a solid excellent job. ""My kind of people would say, Kiss my ass, Scarface."" , ""I live for this sh**."" ""Dick, you've just entered the Xander zone."" This film has everything it has real stunts no fake CGI, no shaky cam. It has a great stunts great jump with a red car corvette, great jump with parachute, great jumps with motorcycle. You have a gang who drive a motor cross, you have a terrorists on a snow mobiles, you have Xander Cage on a snow board fleeing from the avalanche he caused. The Corvette jump was not a CGI and it was filmed simultaneously with eighteen cameras, at the Foresthill Bridge in Auburn, California. At 730 feet, it is the tallest bridge in California, and the third tallest in the United States. That stunt was really insane and dangerous in which Vin Diesel really performed. The movie has a lot of adrenaline stunts field with action. It is a thrill-seeking extreme sport turned in to a spy field with action in this film that's what I love.The movie is also a spy film and espionage which is about group of Anarchy 99 who stole the biological weapon and they distributed in to nerve gas in which the leader Yorgi (Marton Csokas) want's to unleashed in to the city in Prague, Czech Republic and kill millions of people. Xander Cage is recruited and works for NSA to stop this dangerous terrorist. I love how Xander stops Ahab the boat from lunching the rockets he saved the world and he stopped the bad guy.I love Vin Diesel so much and he's performance of Xander Cage is excellent he just fits in the character so much. I love Asia Argento so damn much in this movie she is so hot sexy babe Xander Cage has such a luck to get such a girl for his alley. Samuel L. Jackson is great as Augustus Gibbons, Xander's boss he fits so much in to the character those 3 actors are worth to watch in this movie.The film was mostly shot in California and the rest was shot in Prague, Czech Republic. The director Rob Cohen and producer Neal H. Moritz (who also wrote the script for xXx) from The Fast and the Furious reunites with Vin Diesel again for this movie and it is excellent. The movie has a great soundtracks that I like: Adrenaline by Gavin Rossdale, Feuer Frei by Rammstein and of course Bodies by Drowning Pool.This movie get's an A 9/10 for been my personal favorite Vin Diesel film and it is filed with extreme adrenaline sports and action in to a spy movie I love this film to death! xXx (pronounced as Triple X) is a 2002 American spy action adventure film directed by Rob Cohen, produced by Neal H. Moritz and written by Rich Wilkes. The first installment in the xXx franchise, the film stars Vin Diesel as Xander Cage, a thrill-seeking extreme sports enthusiast, stuntman and rebellious athlete-turned reluctant spy for the National Security Agency who is sent on a dangerous mission to infiltrate a group of potential Russian terrorists in Central Europe. The film also stars Asia Argento, Marton Csokas and Samuel L. Jackson.

69,Angry_Arguer,Fatal,1,28 August 2003,"When True Lies came out, I admit it was lame.  Certainly lamer than T2, but it still had its moments.  James Cameron might not concoct the greatest scripts, have the best casts, or use his camera in the right fashion, but at least he can be concerned about such details as dialog and plot.xXx only shows that ""American cinema"" is getting synonymous with ""American torture methods"".  The movie is one whole mind-numbing, brain-rotting, nihilistic overdose of color and crap.  There is no message, there is no style, there is no understanding of the genre, and, furthermore, it is made by the creators of The Fast and the Furious.  If that movie marks a change in the action genre, I am sorely ashamed to go to the theater today.XXX starts its failures by having an actor who couldn't act to save his neck.  I was happy when Diesel's character bit the dust in 'Private Ryan and this movie made me wish that it happened more often in his movies.  I'd pay to see that.  Not to mention the fact that no effort is made on the behalf of Rob Cohen--whose name has never been related to smart film--to make this film anything better than what it starts out being.Overall, skip this movie.  There isn't anything here that hasn't been done someplace else with more power and finesse.  Just the same as Bad Boys II. 1 out of 5 stars.",xXx
70,spookyrat1,Stunts story Stunts!,4,1 March 2019,"I like Vin Diesel. like Samuel L Jackson and liked The Fast and the Furious (directed by Rob Cohen), but have to say that this is one brain dead movie, where I'd surmise that Cohen and his production team have gone to the well, one too many times.Diesel, in playing the title character, attempts to give us another version of Dominic Toretto, this time without family, but with more money and more supposedly comical lines. I say ""attempts"" because he frequently looks embarrassed about what's going on around him and with good reason. Regarding Sam's ""Gibbons"", think of a smirking Nick Fury with lots more make-up, leading a really dopey team of supposedly elite agents, that wouldn't be up to polishing SHIELD'S floors.This is one of those big budget ""action"" movies that's had plenty of money thrown around to all departments, except the most important ... the scriptwriting office. So what we get is a really weak storyline which only exists to link a series of generally well-constructed, but increasingly cartoonish stunts. I will add that I hope the stunt department were well paid, as they are more of a focus of the movie than the lead actors. I also believe that sadly, one of their brotherhood was killed performing in a second take of a stunt we see late in the film.The whole tone of the film is wrong too. Cohen was clearly attempting an American stylised piss take of the James Bond franchise (There's even a Q character, who is one of the more genuinely comical figures.), but his script is just too thin and way not funny enough. For a lesson in how to do this sort of thing properly, I hope he's since watched the Kingsman movies. Note Rob, they aren't necessarily directed towards pre-adolescent teenage males, like this expensive rubbish.I feel that I'm being generous in awarding this film 4/10, but as mentioned earlier, the production standards are pretty good, as are the quality of many of the stunts, the best being the one involving the bridge early in the film, which echoes a similar one performed in GoldenEye, if I remember correctly.",xXx

73,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,xXx is no 007,2,22 October 2005,"So someone got the idea that James Bond isn't ""cool enough"" and the result is the putrid pile of excrement known as ""xXx.""The opening scene has a spy, in a suit, getting knocked off in an underground club (with Rammstein performing) by bad guys who dress like they are in a High School garage band. With the ""Bond type spy"" removed in this pathetic attempt at a metaphor we are introduced to Xander Cage who is an extreme sports athlete, political activist, and car thief all rolled into one. He starts of by stealing a politicians car and crashing it in an extreme bridge jump then soon enough he is (only Rob Cohen knows why) recruited by a secret agency working for the US Government to spy on some eastern European criminals, but this is only after he has ""proved himself"" in a series of ridiculous tests to see if he is worthy enough of the job. Now this all would have been entertaining and terrific, but (unbeknownst to Rob Cohen) most of the movie going audience isn't 5 years old.Rob Cohen has ""crafted,"" in a truly pathetic attempt, a new action hero who is supposed to relate to the younger audience better because he blasts dance music at parties and plays sports. The only real thing Cohen has created here is a sad excuse for mindless action scenes and a plot so cliché it is not even funny. I mean when the bad guys' motive is ""Mother Russia"" you just cannot help but to laugh. This idiotic, lame, semi-political, pseudo-American patriotic plot element is so tired, and here, presented so badly that Cohen should be embarrassed. Also, the film's supposed claim of James Bond being out of style and boring was spectacularly shot down when ""Die Another Day"" proved better with audiences, critics, and box office. 2/10 Rated PG-13: overblown violence/action, profanity, and ridiculously juvenile sexual material",xXx
74,swilliky,Mediocre action thrills and stunts,4,21 January 2017,"Riding off the success of Pitch Black and The Fast and the Furious, Vin Diesel kept up the stealing cars and criminal hero act with xXx. Diesel plays stuntman Xander Cage who is recruited by NSA Agent Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) to help nab Russian criminals in the Czech Republic. The leader of this group of criminal is a stock villain named Yorgi (Marton Csokas). The acting is over the top and the stunts are outrageous making for a mediocre action flick.Xander Cage takes on a role as an anti-James Bond and solves the international crises that men in nice suits can't. The scar-faced Agent Gibbons puts xXx through a series of tests, knocking him out and throwing him into situations a normal person wouldn't survive. Xander uses his extreme sports skills from biking to skating to outrageous driving to get out of trouble. Facing a lifelong prison sentence, Xander agrees to work with the NSA and heads to the Czech republic. He quickly falls in with the group of criminal using his lack of respect for rules as a gateway into gaining the trust of Yorgi. Xander encounters and falls for the mysterious Yelena (Asia Argento) who he discovers is a secret agent herself. When Xander reveals her secret to her, she doesn't believe him until his cover is blown and he is taken off the mission. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",xXx

There was a lot of action, and not much time wasted between action scenes. The action scenes where longer than most, and many where completely new. I will admit there where quite a few cheezy one liners, but it did not detract for the movie at all. The plot was more creative than I had thought it would be, and the band was awesome. I could only hope they perform that way live. A very good action movie.",xXx
78,LebowskiT1000,Mindless Action....But Fun,7,14 August 2002,"I can't say that I loved or hated ""xXx"", it had it's high points and it's low points.  There were a ton of little things I didn't like about the film, just tiny little things that I would have liked changed.  Other than those little things, the movie was pretty decent, for the most part.The action and stunts in this movie is most definitely an overdose, I couldn't believe how much flashy stuff was in this film.  If you like to see stuff get blown up then you'll surely like this movie.The only major complaint about the movie that I have is the scene where he's in Columbia (or where ever he is) and is riding around on that motorcycle. He was just flying all over the place with that thing, and no ramps or anything in sight.  That scene kind of bugged me, but it was over fairly soon and the movie went on.As for the story, it was nothing terribly complicated, pretty much your typical bad-guy-wants-to-create-chaos-and-good-guy-has-to-stop-him sort of story .  Lots of cookie-cutter bad guys and what not, but it's all in good fun.In the film's defense though, there were a lot of cool things to see.  Some of the stunts were just phenomenal and a few scenes in particular that just made me grin like an idiot because I liked it so much.  Also, seeing Rammstein in the film was a pleasant surprise.  AWESOME music (I kind of wish they'd have used a different song in the film though)!!!As for the actors, they all pretty much did an ok job.  Vin Diesel was just what you'd expect, although he did have some pretty bad dialogue in the film.  I'm really shocked that Samuel L. Jackson agreed to do this film, but hey, that's just fine with me.  I thought he did an ok job, nothing extraordinary, but good enough for me.  The rest of the cast was good, nothing to complain about.One other thing I'd really like to mention is that the trailers gave away WAY TOO MUCH!!!!  I didn't see a whole lot of television commercials, but I did see the trailers in the theaters, and they gave away just about every cool scene.  I was a little bummed, but I'm sure a few months from now I won't care.This review is getting a bit longer than I had expected, so I'll wrap this up.  I thought the movie was pretty good, not as good as Vin Diesel and director Rob Cohen's last film, ""The Fast And The Furious"", but still a fine movie.  I've noticed a great deal of people comparing this film to the James Bond films (as is to be expected).  I would definitely agree that this film is better than some of the older Bond films, but I wouldn't dare say that this one is better than the more recent Bond films.  So, anyway, if you're into action movies with lots of explosions and some crazy stunts or just want to see Vin Diesel with his shirt off, then you'll definitely want to see this film.  If you're looking for a movie with some real substance to it, this is not the film for you.  In any case, I hope you enjoy the film and thanks for reading,-Chris",xXx
79,Antagonisten,Sucks,3,23 January 2005,"Seldom has an action movie given me the same feeling that xXx did. A mighty yawn is the best description i can give you. ""A lot of noise for nothing"" is another good description.Xander Cage (Vin Diesel) is an extreme sports legend who is known for his extreme stunts that he films. Now he is contracted by the US government for an undercover mission in eastern Europe. Somehow they feel that Cage might have a better chance at succeeding where regular agents have failed.The premise of this film is of course ridiculous. But that in itself does not always mean that the movie will be ridiculous. Unfortunately this movie though is just as bad as the premise. Beside Diesels usual wooden acting, Asia Argentos pathetic accent and the general lack of acting (Sam Jackson excluded) is the fact that this movie never raises your pulse. When i see an action movie i want to be thrilled, i want something to make my heart race. I want to be sit with my mouth open in disbelief. And here they, on top of things, mixed extreme sports and action movies. That sounds like a pretty good mix for the action sequences. Still, there is not a single action scene in this movie that gives me that thrill. Rather there is just a whole lot of noise going on, but it never goes anywhere. Loads of foreplay and no climax you might say.So, does this suck? Yes it most certainly does. There is no real reason to watch this at all since there are hardly any redeeming qualities. Might be just to watch the clothing in this movie then. It's not often that you see someone dressed in a fur jacked and tank-top. I rate this 3/10 (clothing included).",xXx
80,Spanner-2,Entertaing,6,12 August 2002,"This action vehicle stars Vin Diesel as the new breed of action star, tough guy jerks with little appealing personality who engage in impressive stuntwork to beat up the bad guys. Now dont get me wrong, this is a perfectly entertaining  film, but Diesel is just not  a very likeable guy and that does hurt the film to some extent... though the visuals and the action sequences remain top notch, though some of the scenes involving digital people looked a tad fake to me. Samuel L. Jackson is great, as always, playing Diesel's agent boss.. and the script has a few creative touches.. so I suppose it is worth it despite Vin's character issues. GRADE: B",xXx

The stunts are very fake and overblown, particularly where Vin Diesel tries to outrun an avalanche.After all, these types of movies are meant to be eye candy and not bother with the story.It wasn't crap, but is wasn't good either.

82,PyrolyticCarbon,"Big action flick with fun set pieces, good entertainment although the ending sags a little",6,17 January 2005,"You get what you expect with this movie, an action fest filled with one liners and little in the way of character development, but you know what, it's okay, you are still allowed to enjoy it, and that's exactly what I did.Yeah, it's a no brainer and there are a few laughs where you expect maybe there shouldn't be, but you're still laughing and that's enjoyment. Who knows, perhaps they were expected! The plot isn't that tough to get a hold of, and the character of Vin Diesel just devours the screen almost blocking out the point for a plot in the first place, but it still doesn't matter. The action scenes are excellent fun, and watching the amazing avalanche sequence is wonderful. You know it just can't work out like that, but still, it's fantastic to watch.The acting isn't that bad and it's well filmed, and until you see the master plan in action everythings going along to plan and formula. It's that last part of the movie that bugs me, that contraption that is launched just seems toylike and over engineered to me. Without raising a laugh, it makes a mockery of what the film has been trying to do to that point and just looks entirely out of place.However, the stupid contraption aside, it's a really fun movie and a good way to waste a few hours in the name of entertainment. Diesel is very good and commands screen time, and the whole premise works out quite well.What did surprise me is seeing the almost subtle movement of the character from caring about himself and getting out of the mission alive and as soon as possible, to caring about the future of one person and then suddenly about the mission and the saving of the city. It was interesting seeing those scenes that pinpointed some of these moves and reinforced the stereotyped aspects of his character.Oh, plus he drove a really cool car in the film! The DVD Commentary is very entertaining and informative, with some really good insights into the process of filming and the characters involved. Rob Cohen clearly shows his passion for cinema throughout. The additional extras are enjoyable as well, and with deleted scenes including their own commentary, the whole package sits well on DVD.",xXx

At first when this came out I didn't run out to see it, but as soon as it made it to DVD I rented it. It actually wasn't terrible, but wasn't the best either. It was basically just your average action movie, with some low budget dialog and great action scenes. This movie is really fit for those hardcore action fans out there. I wouldn't call it hardcore action but it was decent at best. The action was very consistent and the dialog wasn't the best, but wasn't terrible as well.

After being arrested he ends up in a top secret government facility under the control of Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) and is told that Xander, along with two other guys are competing to get a top secret job and have his criminal record cleared.After the stupidest fight scene of the modern day including Xavier jumping a bike thirty feet over a fence with no ramp leading up to it, and him avoiding hundreds of soldiers and a military helicopter, he gets the job. Xander is to spy on and collect information on a diabolical mad man named Yorgi (Marton Csokas). For no reason, Xander goes out to complete the mission. Wow letting a criminal into a foreign country and not watching him. Of course he won't run, and he doesn't.Instead after infiltrating the place he manages to do things James Bond couldn't do let alone any human being. The acting is terrible, the plot, slim, and the action, mildly amusing. Their is no character development or interaction.

86,smakawhat,Borderline good,6,15 September 2002,"Vin Diesel, plays Xander Cage, a renegade punk who likes to play around and make daredevils stunts.  We first get a glimpse of him stealing a senators corvette, and then drive it off a bridge while parachuting out of it before it explodes into a canyon, as his colleagues video tape the entire thing ready to post his latest adventure on the internet for the whole world to see.  However, Xander is later ambushed at his home by a secret agency [led by Samuel Jackson] who decides that it has lost too many secret agents and would like to use thugs like Xander who might be intelligent and adventurous, but just expendable enough to infiltrate a secret agency overseas bent on destroying (what else) the world.  Xander having 2 strikes against him for his lawlessness can't exactly refuse, his bridge stunt would be strike 3 and it's either take the mission or spend 20 years in jail.So this is bond with a twist really.  Does it work?  Well the stunts are great, the plot is typical Bond recycling..  nothing wrong with that but I can't think of a film I have seen in recent years that left me so borderline.  Is it cool.. oh hell yeah,  check out that snow boarding scene, what about believable??  Not at all, this movie is all about fun and escapism anyway...  How can I not like a film that has Rammstein opening up the show!!  Skin???  Oh yeah there's some good one's in there.But then there is Diesel.  Does he work in this film, yes when he has to flex muscle either physically or verbally with one liners he's a winner. But when it comes to being an intelligent character no, because deep down when you look at him he's not sophisticated he's not a ladies man.  He is a thug, and walks around as if he's putting potholes in the floor.  Kind of awkward.  At times I found myself really enjoying this film, and at other times not..  I came out thinking is this a neat new character, or is this just Bond mixed with Xtreme Sports?   Is this a good escape?? oh hell yeah, sexy???  sure!  Well acted?  Not really...  And Samuel Jackson's talent and character is wasted.Worth seeing?  maybe..Rating 6.5 out of 10",xXx
87,bix171,Not Quite,5,21 January 2003,"Star Vin Diesel and director Rob Cohen reunite to update the spy genre but the vehicle they've chosen is somewhat inferior to their previous joint effort, the audacious speed-jockey opera `The Fast And The Furious'. While not a complete washout, `XXX' seems determined to shoehorn the extreme sports action into the creaky, cliché-driven 007-retread of a plot instead of liberating it and while there are plenty of dazzling stunts and effects they seem unwisely strung together in a desperate attempt to deflect the many shortcomings in Rich Wilkes' script. Cohen clearly has a talent for colorful visuals and kinetic editing (three editors worked on the project) and he's making a case for becoming the preeminent action specialist working today but it's a halfhearted bid--his lack of interest in providing more content to give the razzle-dazzle some emotional weight indicates an inability to climb to the A-list of his genre's directors. Diesel disappoints this time as well; his heart doesn't seem to be in the project and though his silky bass-baritone delivers his bad jokes with ease he seems more focused on trying to develop a brand name than sticking to the matter at hand.",xXx
88,flingebunt,xXx is actually a genetic disease,6,7 March 2005,"James bond was an invention of the 1950s and 1960s. He was cool because he wore a tuxedo, drank vodka martinis (the cool drink of the period), treats women like objects and had a license to kill.The problem is that cool moves on a bond doesn't. xXx takes the wonderfully successful formula of the bond movies and attempts to put in a new character.Xander Cage is an action sports hero blackmailed into being a super spy. He is cool for the no rules generation. He loves risk for risks sake, but is still alive because he takes none. He dresses outlandishly (are we sure he is based on James Bond, not Austin powers). He is a reluctant hero who is more loyal to human life that his country. He is uses non lethal violence, rather than be an assassin (Bond is a murderer and this has never really sat well with modern audiences).Does it work, the answer is, partly. Too much time is spent on recruiting Xander to the mission and his reason for being and his motivation is generally unconvincing.The whole pretext is unconvincing, so it would have been better if they spent less time on it and got to the action.Yet it is an interesting experiment, good fun, bad acting (especially Vin Diseal who usually is convincing enough in the roles he plays, not enough overacting on the part of the villains, high testosterone action.But they never really understood Bond. You have to realise, Bond is not a spy but an operative.

89,barberoux,Things blowed up real good.,4,3 February 2003,"""XXX"" was a loud stupid movie.  Some of the stunts were fun but ridiculously over the top.  The movie consists of lots of people shot with machine guns, flaming blasts and babes dancing.  As is typical for this type of movie the gadgets are used once and forgotten.  If they wanted to know what was going on in the castle why not use the miraculous,(and totally unbelievable), binoculars to see right through the walls and watch the goings on, with sound.  Those binoculars alone would have solved most of the problems in the movie.  Maybe the batteries ran down. Vin Diesel plays a good action hero but needs a script with a bit more substance.  The lead babe, Asia Argento, played a morose, complaining, skinny chick.  She needs 10 pounds and a good night's sleep.  I fail to see her appeal.  Miss it.",xXx
90,shanfloyd,"Cheap plot, good action",8,12 January 2003,"As the tagline says, Xander Cage ( Diesel ) is ""a new breed of special agent"". Well, if you compare him with our familiar special agents like Mr. Bond you may find some things in common, like having a ""boss"". Here M is replaced by Gibbons ( Jackson ). Anyway xXx has also some new things to offer. He's not quite a serious special agent. He's an adrenaline junkie who rather thinks life is quite a joke.
And his special abilities are now utilised to save mankind from a dangerous nuclear weapon unleashed by a mad criminal. Such a cheap plot... but the movie succeeds to attract audience (mostly teens) probably because of its cinematography, superb background music and cast selection.
No one would play Cage better. This movie can only be seen just for having Vin Diesel in action.",xXx

92,stormhawk2021,"Not a greatest action movie, but entertains",5,14 May 2017,"If any future filmmakers are looking for inspiration in the guilty- pleasure high octane action genre, xXx is exactly the film to look into. What's not to like about it? Heck, even the horribly awful things are entertaining.Back when Vin Diesel decided not to come back to the Fast & Furious franchise, he chose to join F&F 1 director Rob Cohen in taking on another ridiculous action extravaganza, xXx. Now, the Fast & Furious franchise has figured out the right balance of lighthearted humor, bada** action sequences, and developed characters who we actually care about. xXx certainly has fun action, but that's about it. The humor is there, but in no way do I believe it's intentionally funny. And the characters are pretty awful. Or, at least the dialogue coming out of their mouths is awful.But does a film like this really need to have great dialogue? I guess not. Especially when it contains countless one-liners that do nothing but put a smile on my face from ear to ear. Essentially, this is just another Fast & Furious movie. Fast cars, explosions, women in scantily clad attire, incoherent plots, over-the-top villains, and catchy music. All are staples of the franchise, and Xander Cage's first film outing is no different. The supporting characters are fittingly absurd and bizarre, led by a prototypical performance from Samuel L. Jackson & an equally clichéd turn from Marton Csokas. I think the bottom line is, this movie is so far-fetched and insane that it works as one of the best mindless action adventures of the last decade. No one would believe a guy like Xander Cage would be recruited as an undercover agent in any sort of organization, but that's not really the point. xXx sets out to entertain, and that it does.",xXx

94,Shiva-11,James bond meets the X-games...,7,13 August 2002,"By Greg UrsicMention the word ""spy"" and for most people it conjures up British accents, tuxedos and martinis  shaken, not stirred of course. While I've been a Bond fan for longer than I care to admit, let's be realistic for a moment; it's pretty hard to relate to a polished pseudo aristocrat who beds supermodels, battles supervillains and saves the world on a weekly basis. Where are all the regular Joe average superspies?Xander Cage is an attitude riddled adrenalin junkie who is always looking for the next big fix. His fun comes to an abrupt stop when his latest stunt catches the attention of the wrong person in the NSA and Xander gets shanghaied. It seems that a certain anarchist group, composed of earthy ex-Red Army regulars is intent on ushering in a new era, and suave, sophisticated spies stick out like, well, suave sophisticated spies. The NSA feels that this is a task that Xander, a tattooed delinquent, deemed to be the `best and brightest of the bottom of the barrel' would be perfect for. Well, with a few exceptions.With Schwarzenegger contemplating a run for Governor, and Willis finally being accepted as a `serious' actor, the Action Hero genre has been left bereft of a genuine successor. Enter Vin Diesel, a man of few words, who first popped up on Hollywood's radar when his indie film `Multi-facial', which he wrote, directed and starred in received great reviews at Caanes. Most importantly, Diesel caught the attention of Steven Spielberg, who cast him in `Saving Private Ryan' as Private Caparzo. His breakout role as Dominic Toretto in `The Fast and the Furious' (a film intended to showcase Paul Walker) proved his power as a box office draw and he was soon being hailed as the go to action hero for the next millennia (Revolution Studios is betting huge that he will be- they signed him to a three picture deal and will pay him $20 million for the first sequel).As Xander, Diesel is surprisingly low key  he is pensive, humorous, growly and explosive when necessary - and there is no doubt that `XXX' is his vehicle. Diesel dominates every scene that he appears in with an understated cockiness, and those ever-bulging biceps. Asia Argento (daughter of horror meister Dario Argento) affects a Courtenay Love style persona  her Yelena is tough, b*tchy, no nonsense and cold as ice. Yelena, like Xander, is edgy, rough, and quick-witted. The supporting cast, with the exception of Samuel Jackson as Xander's slick and slimy protégé, are largely unremarkable.
The action sequences are for lack of a better word, extreme: from the opening base jump (okay, technically it's not a base jump in the strictest sense of the term) with a twist sequence, to the amazing freestyle motocross sequence to the boarding, the stunts are amazing. I also appreciated the fact that neither the spies or the gadgets have much polish  the Q equivalent in `XXX' is a total geek/frat boy wannabe whose gadgets lack subtlety, and are largely untested (XXX's retrofitted GTO requires a `Gadgets for Dummies' guide). There are several elements that hamstring the film however.The actors are constantly hemmed in by lackluster dialogue  it doesn't matter how charismatic a character is, they are ultimately defined by their writing. There were no pithy catch phrases or witticisms  a necessity for any action hero. There are also too many lulls in the film  I appreciated the action sequences but repeatedly found myself getting bored with the filler in between. Also, the `secret' plot elements were far too obvious and easily divined. Finally, I was largely unimpressed with the FX used in several sequences (especially the avalanche).If you are looking to give the old gray matter and inject some excitement into your weekend, splurge on a matinee.",xXx

Vin Diesel is a good enough actor to have a leading role. Asia Argento is gorgeous. The car chases, the bike chases, the stunts, everything is made for one purpose only: to suspend disbelief and have some fun. I did, and I'm glad for it.There is another point to be made - nobody seems to have noticed that the main character never smokes, drinks or uses drugs, even telling one of the bad guys ""cigarrettes will kill you"".

I give it an 8.This one is about an Extreme Athelete, Xander Cage (Vin Diesel), who is unwillingly recruited to perform a black ops type of infiltration of an international criminal organization. Yes it is kind of a stupid idea, but in the genre of action movies, many story lines are.I gave it an 8 because the action sequences are exciting and fun,and the pace of the movie makes it even more fun. The acting was a little weak, but then again it is a Vin Diesel movie. I am not too proud to say that I have a crush on Asia Argento and wish she did more Hollywood movies. For that point I definitely got my Asia Agrento fix.This is not for you if you want to sit down and watch a well thought out espionage thriller this, but if its some mindless action you crave it is absolutely what the doctor ordered. You may find the storyline a little outrageous but what it lacks there it makes up for in exciting action, and that's all it really is suppose to be.Like my reviews? Hate em?

I found it far less predictable than the James Bond junk that is churned out every three   years. The last Bond movies were sleep inducing. This isn't. If you think the concept of Vin Diesel as a secret agent extreme sports fanatic is improbable, wait until you have to make sense of a 50-something British flamboyant ""secret"" agent having 20-something babes swoon all over him.

99,ilovedolby,Terrible Film?,2,18 January 2003,"I have to admit that I wasn't expecting much from this film. The trailer made it seem so ridiculous and predictable. Starring Vin Diesel (Saving Private Ryan, Pitch Black), plays an extreme sports fanatic who is sent by our government to find out about a Russian secret society called, Anarchy '99. Naturally, this secret society, or gang, has plans of world domination by the use of chemical weapons. It's a pretty obvious plot that we have seen used before. Some may say that I should lighten up about the whole thing, and remember that this kind of film is more for fun, what with it's action sequences, slick one-liners, fast cars, cool fight scenes, and beautiful women. Well, its action sequences weren't done all that well, in my opinion. Its slick one-liners weren't even amusing. I could care less about its fast cars, or it's typical fight sequences. It does have a beautiful woman, but most of them seem like skanks. There was one thing that I did think was somewhat cool; an avalanche scene, that although was impossible, was cool visually. And Vin Diesel can act, although this was a film that really didn't require him to give a good performance. I would have expected something much better from director Rob Cohen, who last year directed the successful film, The Fast & The Furious, which wasn't that bad at all. But XXX just stinks! Look, to sum it up, XXX tries to be a younger, cooler James Bond. Sorry folks, you don't send a boy to do a man's job. * 1/2",xXx

101,fredericksmith1952,This is an incredibly adept and insightful parody of the Bond genre that has been railroaded as an attempt at a serious action film.,10,20 March 2012,"Triple X, is an updated version of James Bond battling the evil forces of SMERSH or SPECTRE or whatever group of baddies are in the mix at the time. Vin's character, the extreme sport athlete known as Xander Cage, is the ideal candidate for this type of assignment. He's agile, quick on his feet, and knows how to deal with the counter culture. Some people have said in reviews he is not ""acting"" in this film, but they are probably the same folks who feel that Anthony Hopkins is just another pretentious Englishman. Samuel L. Jackson does an excellent job of portraying the pragmatic NSA operative who realizes the world is changing, even if his superiors do not. Marton Csokas (and the rest of his mob) are all two dimensional, stereotypical bad guys, and the good guys are the same...which is exactly what they needed to be for this film. Asia Argento may never win an academy award, but she rises to the task in xXx portraying Yelena, the forgotten FSB agent who is trying to survive. The real treats in the film are the inclusion of Danny Trejo as the Columbian drug lord and Michael Roof as Toby Lee Shavers, the ""Q"" of the NSA who has only two loves, making impossible weapons and chasing (unsuccessfully) hot women, of which there are plenty in this film. In short, this is an incredibly adept and insightful parody of the Bond genre that has been railroaded as an attempt at a serious action film. And that is particularly disturbing considering how often we use the letter X to denote extreme. When you watch this film, enjoy it for what it is, a flight of fantasy taken to the Extreme. Rated PG-13 for violence and language and some innuendo, the teens in the house ought to enjoy this as much as anyone who likes Bond genre films.

102,Someguysomwhere,Daredevil lawbreaker is enlisted by the U.S. government to penetrate a foreign organization.,4,4 April 2007,"Serious Vin Diesel fans may forgive the flaws in this movie (or not) and find it worthwhile. What's wrong with this movie? All the important things: the acting (principally Diesel's), the action, and the script. All in that order.I personally like Vin Diesel and think he has presence but unfortunately he is a bad actor. Presence can only take you so far in the ACTING business. The people who made this film should have realized this and given him fewer lines. Let him play the strong, silent-type. Instead, they let him play a cocky, wise-ass. Mistake, since this type is talkative. Less would have been more.The same thing for the action. It was over-the-top and not believable. Nothing wrong with fantastic action as long as it's done so well that you believe it did happen, like a magician's trick. They should have done less of the over-the-top stuff to make the action more credible. People go to a movie to suspend their reality and enter an alternate as voyeurs. The success of this depends largely on credibility. In other words: you, the movie-goer, can't be THERE (nor do you want to be) unless you believe it's happening.Lastly, the script. It's the least of the movie's fault. But considering everything I've said before the movie might have done better if it had leaned toward comedy. Then bad acting and poorly orchestrated action would not have been so visible. It could all have been considered a part of the ""comedy object"".I give this film 4 stars out of ten which means you should see it if you have nothing better to do or you are a serious Vin Diesel fan who doesn't care.

It fails at life. It fails on every single level. The action is too over-the-top for you to take anything seriously. The acting is so bad from our muscular leading man Diesel that you root for HIM to die, not the bad guy. Just watching his stoned, one-note face and listening to his emotionless, painfully self-righteous voice is enough to make you want to throw up. This ex-bouncer is possibly the worst actor who ever made it big. He makes you forget Affleck and Coleman Francis, that's how bad he is.The story is dumb and contrived. xXx is a film directed without any style at all, filled to the brim with extreme sports, ""cool"" attitudes, tough cars, gay-ass shirts for Vin, rave music, and all the things the director thinks is cool enough to bring the teenage crowd into the theaters. Unfortunately, he was right.Since xXx aims to be full-blown, no-limits action, you would expect me to say ""at least the action scenes were good"". No. The action is so overblown, so ridiculous and pointless it just feels like overkill. Obviously we need an explosion every two or three scenes, how else are we supposed to follow what's going on without falling asleep?Samuel L. Jackson keeps cashing in money with little to show for it, riding on his popularity after Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown and True Romance.

106,extravaluejotter,Watchable Bond-Lite,6,12 January 2007,"Vin Diesel is a very watchable actor, with distinctive features, a muscular physique and a voice that feels like he's pouring Jack Daniels into your ears. The fact that he can also portray more complex emotions than ""Happy"" and ""Grumpy"" makes him one of the most under-rated actors currently working in Hollywood.However, his agent has very poor judgement and for every decent film he's appeared in, there's a clunker that outweighs it. For every ""Pitch Black"" there's a ""The Fast and The Furious"", which is a real shame. ""xXx"" falls between these extremes, fortunately.In ""xXx"", director Rob Cohen manages to craft a more believable star vehicle for Diesel than the jalopy he rolled out of the garage in 2001. The script may be sub-Bond but it's an inventive and distinctly up-to-date spin on the standard spy movie formula. Cohen makes the most of the humorous elements of the plot and also manages to create some tension as well. His team do good work with the impressive stunts and the use of CGI in them is kept to almost tolerable levels. You can, for example, almost believe it when X is snowboarding ahead of a massive avalanche.Setting the bulk of the action in the Czech Republic is a good move, as the locations are clearly not the back lot of an LA sound stage. The armourer also bought in some Czech-made weapons, a nice realistic touch for all the gun-nuts out there. Unfortunately the armourer also supplied Vin with one of the least convincing prop guns in movie history. X's pistol has a blocky barrel and compensator that looks like it's been hacked off an automatic and glued on to a revolver frame. It also gets a cheap (£19 on eBay) red dot sight AND a laser. That's right, gun fans. 2 red dots to aim with! It's as ugly as it is pointless.Vin Diesel is backed up by a solid supporting cast who all act like they mean it. It's the conviction with which this story is told that lifts it above merely mediocre. That makes me recommend ""xXx"" as an OK brain-out popcorn action movie. It even rates 6.5 out of 10.",xXx

Was I satisfied?Sure. The first half hour is great, good action scene with vette, great coffee scene and laughable Columbian start. After than, the movie goes a little bit slowly and try to copy new bond movies with nearly impossible action scenes, Q's gadgets and a maniac who wants to kill a half of a world population.What puts this movie a little above average is Vin Diesel. He was the right pick for a role of confident, pumped up and ""I-don't-wannabe-spy"" type of guy, though he would be wholly inappropriate to play a role of James Bond.

His timing and delivery of one-liners (important if you're to become the hero of an action franchise) is pretty rotten. Rob Cohen's overkill on the motorbike jumps wore thin quickly, but the avalanche scene was cool. So the direction was adequate, if somewhat uninspired. Asia Argento reminds me of Joan Cusack. With less wit and worse teeth. The villain sounded like Ed Ross' Nicolai out of Six Feet Under. The ending was pure cheese.Like I said: random thoughts.

From an action point of view, this movie's about as much fun as you can have with your pants still on. Buildings explode, bullets fly by and Vin Diesel grins and goofs about like any self-respecting action star should. I mean okay, the movie doesn't give it's audience any credit for intelligence, utilising a paper-thin plot to lead us about like a blind man, and the entire female cast, even Asia Argento (who trust me is very good when she's GIVEN SOMETHING TO WORK WITH...), are really just left to sit around and look pretty while all the exploding goes on, but I can't hold that against it too much. It just must be explained first.Given the way of the Hollywood blockbuster, i.e. the hideously PC lacklustre uninvolving pap we're getting force-fed these days that you instantly forget when you leave the theatre, it's nice to see a film that doesn't care if you like it or not. xXx is this movie. It knows it's not big, clever or funny, but it doesn't care and it gets on with it's exploding wares with admirable effort. In fact xXx is much like it's star Vin Diesel. He, and the film, may not be the greatest in their field but damn it they're gonna try as hard as possible to keep your bum on the seat.They succeed. You won't be forgetting xXx in a hurry. You might not enjoy it as much as I did, but if none of this film leaves a gawping 'wow, they actually went and did that' expression on your face, you may well be dead. My only real criticism other than the movie's stereotypical nature (which is a given anyhow given it's director and publicity) is it's running time. I watched the extended special edition cut and it's about 2 hours 10 minutes. Either way you cut it that's a long time to sit through a movie that boils down to 'get girl, kill baddies'. Minor gripe though. Check it out, it's worth your time.",xXx
111,mweston,2 stars (out of 4),5,15 October 2002,"Maybe I expected too much. From the previews, it appeared that maybe this would be James Bond for the 21st century.

The hero, Xander Cage (Vin Diesel) steals a Corvette, leads police on a chase, and jumps it off of a very high bridge, escaping by parachute. And he captures all of this on video from many angles. It turns out he's some sort of an extreme stunt and video game underground star. And when he gets home after all of this, there's a huge party waiting for him.Meanwhile, Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) of the NSA (in the ""M"" role) is having problems. His agents, who are more in the James Bond mold, don't fit in with the people they are trying to spy on: an organization called Anarchy 99. He needs someone like Xander. So he recruits Xander and a few others like him, who are in trouble with the law or would be if they had been caught. Threatening Xander with jail time if he doesn't go along, Gibbons convinces him to become an agent.Toby Lee Shavers (Michael Roof) is the NSA agent in the role like Bond's ""Q."" He's just a geeky guy who has been in the agency for years and never sent into the field. He's the only comic relief in the movie, unless you count the unintentionally funny dialog.Yelena (Asia Argento, who is actually Italian) is the girl. She doesn't get a last name, but at least she gets a first name and a mildly interesting character. The rest of the women in the movie are purely decoration. You would think that, if this is James Bond for a new generation, the status of women would be better. But in fact it is *far* worse.Yorgi (Marton Csokas, from New Zealand) is the eastern European villain. He's fine but not very memorable. His fortress is cool, but his evil plan is more ridiculous than most James Bond villains' plans.The cinematography was better than I expected. The filming was done in locations including Prague and Lake Tahoe, and it looks very good. The special effects generally didn't call attention to themselves, which is a good thing, except for an avalanche, which looked horribly fake.The big problems with the movie have already been mentioned above. The dialog is distractingly bad. The villain isn't compelling. The special effects aren't always. Not mentioned yet is the soundtrack, which was heavy on rap and probably good for the target demographic, but not for me (I did appreciate hearing the theme from ""The Third Man"" being played briefly on the zither, but that doesn't make it onto the soundtrack CD).I would recommend *not* seeing this movie. That said, some people have liked it far more than I did, and it has done very good box office business, so there will be sequels. I just hope they hire better writers next time.Seen on 8/17/2002.",xXx

This film is a Bond movie by another name. It's begins badly, but once the location moves to Prague it becomes more interesting. The bad guys are bad and smoke cigarettes, like bad guys should. The femme fatale is a luscious Russian spy. The action scenes are totally over the top, as they always are in a Bond film. The only thing wrong with it is the lead actor with his thick, tattooed arms, shaved head and absence of talent.There are some risible scenes in which he camouflages himself by wearing a shiny head on top of his black outfit at night, and still wears the black outfit when he's sneaking up on the baddies in a snow-covered mountain. There are some almost touching scenes with the sexy Russian spy - but I felt sorry for her having to kiss him. I don't remember Mr. Diesel being this bad in Pitch Black.Initially, I was prepared to give this film no more than 5 out of 10 for effort, but it rose to a 6 when I finally found myself enjoying it. It would have made 7 out of 10 except for the lack of a credible actor as xXxander, the Muscles from, er, LA.Oh - and Samuel L. Jackson? I wonder if he's still hitting his forehead against a brick wall saying ""Why? Why? Why?"". Not your best role, Sam sweetie.",xXx
113,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 72,7,2 February 2017,"Has action changed all that much since 2002? Because action in movies has. Back before about 10 years ago, characters were much less jokey, things blew up a lot more, and bad guys had terrible aim.While dated as can be, xXx is an enjoyable watch. The film's inspiration is questionable, but Vin Diesel plays the title role exactly how you'd expect him to. There is no shortage of platitudinous quips, but he delivers them in a way that makes you forget that the dialogue is terribly written.Diesel plays Xander Cage, aka Triple X, a criminal stunt man hired by the US government to infiltrate the international mercenary group, Anarchy 99. There's not a whole lot more to it than that, yet the film seems to be able to stretch itself to nearly 120 minutes (132 in the director's cut).xXx is so 2002 that, at times, you can't differentiate it from a early 2000s Disney Channel Original Movie. It sacrifices practicality for spectacle whenever it gets the chance. But considering its action-based modus operandi, the film still tends to drag at times.Ultimately xXx does nothing new. At all. The only reason why anyone would watch this film is to experience Vin Diesel's charisma and charm. Because that's really the only unique aspect brought to the otherwise trite premise.But it's entertaining. Mindless, but entertaining. Despite the hackneyed script, you have to commend the movie for not taking itself too seriously, ultimately not making it a chore to watch. It's actually quite fun and ridiculous in all its glory.Twizard Rating: 72",xXx
114,Captain Ed,"Mindless, popcorn-munching fun",7,23 August 2002,"Let's face it, no one is going to see XXX to be enlightened or to have their philosophy broadened.  This is a popcorn movie, one that demands little from the audience except to sit back and suspend a lot of disbelief.Vin Diesel is fabulous as the eponymous, newly-minted secret agent who is (oddly enough for a secret agent) world famous.  How he gets to be an agent is pretty entertaining; fat ankles and exploding cocaine fields get him through his tests.  These are conducted by Samuel L. Jackson, who is on hand to 'supervise' his newest employee.  Yeah, right -- good luck.  Anyway, Diesel owns this film, absolutely grabbing you by the lapels and dragging you along for the ride with his athleticism and his Bronx charm.  Maybe major stars have exploded onto the scene in better vehicles, but make no mistake, Diesel has arrived.  Keep your expectations low and your eyes wide open, and you will have a tough time finding a more fun way to pass a couple of summer hours in a theater.  7 out of 10.",xXx
115,smashattack,"A little bland, but better than I expected.",6,15 February 2003,"When I first saw the commercials for XXX, I was thinking, ""Oh, great, another stupid teen flick.""  When I first saw it, I wasn't too far off. However, I expected it to be totally stupid, and to act way too cool for itself.  It actually wasn't as bad as I thought.  It isn't something I would have seen in theaters (I actually skipped the chance), but it's also something I wouldn't mind seeing again.Xander Cage is a party animal with some ugly tattoos and an obsession with rebelling against the government.  His resourcefulness is recruited by the CIA (or one of those many, many U.S. secret organizations) and is forced to pass several tests.  One of the ""tests"" isn't bad, but the second is so far from reality that it's almost funny.  ""Triple X"" does so many stunts in the Colombian field that it's not only supernatural, but disgustingly unnecessary.One major downfall of this movie is the music.  I forgot who composed the original score, but that's not the bad part.  The bad part is the music from popular songwriters that are shoved into the movie.  Half of them don't even fit, and I'd like to mention that all of them are pretty stupid.  I've never been a fan of rock or metal, since recently it's been so uncultured and just plain nasty.  I guess it fits the movie amazingly well...Anyway, there are some good scenes and some bad scenes.  The climax actually isn't so far out.  It seems to be pretty realistic, if you want to call having a car with every James Bond equipment slapped into it ""realistic"". One bad seen involves a prostitute, which isn't necessary in a movie.  But this movie is supposed to appeal to teenage men, so I suppose it's... er, ""appropriate""?  Yeah, right.All in all, I found XXX to be a little better than I imagined.  However, it's not MUCH better, it's only a little.  Some of the action is good, and some is totally ridiculous.  Don't watch this movie unless you're either sick, staying at home, and don't have anything better to do (like I did) or you're into this kind of near-mindless action.",xXx

Vin Diesel could have been replaced by a steel pole and i wouldn't have noticed. The only good thing? Asia Argento is hot and a good distraction from the rest of the crap on screen. The so-called action scenes are weak and unexciting. They looked like they were put together with firecrackers and toy cars. Triple X would not last five minutes with James Bond.

The plot is ludicrous, the characters unbelievable and the acting (oh, I mentioned this already) dilettante. Effects had gone overboard and factualities of science wildly disregarded. Yet! Yet, this movie was quite the entertaining one. Subtly (purposely?) funny at places completely overshadowing the dysfunctional slapstick that absolutely didn't cut it, and above everything else - it didn't hesitate. The action was brilliantly choreographed and impressively implemented.Thomas Nielsenp.s. Samuel L. Jackson should really not have been here.

Since then I've tried watching it again and it really does suck. So I guess my friend and I witnessed a rare thing in the movie world. A movie that works only once and then decays immediately afterwards. The ultimate in disposable culture. You watch it once and then throw it away.

In fact, any of his other movies are better than this one, simply because every other movie of his made sense. I felt this one just kind of throws both Diesel and the viewer into the action without giving us a half decent reason for him to be there in the first place. XXX's strongest redeeming element is it's mindless action - you can just turn off your brain, because you won't have to think once while watching this movie.",xXx
122,Streetwolf,"Unrealistic stunts, plot was good, but..",7,30 December 2002,"After reading many reviews I finally gave this movie a chance and it wasn't half bad...i said half.Summary: Xander Cage is an extreme sports adrenaline junkie slash small time criminal, who is famous due to his stunts and videos that he makes whilst he does something weird. At the same time the NSA are looking to hire someone from the outside with a track record of being a criminal that will help them break a Russian mob ring, that seem to be up to no good. Xander gets chosen for the task and after a few tests and over the top stunts he gets sent to Russia for the mission.Vin Diesel is great in this movie as being the tough new agent who has no idea what he is doing, but still does it with style when he has to escape or to infiltrate. As for everyone else they made the movie look bad. I counted 3 cars, 5 motorbikes and a few buildings blown up, the motorbike stunts looked so fake they actually bored me, but the snowboarding stunts were a breath taking! The ending was not bad, but there were some things in the movie that were terrible. Lame love scenes, Vin Diesel seems to have a hard time kissing the women!I rated this movie 7/10",xXx
123,jake-179,"eXcellent, eXtremely eXciting!",10,16 August 2002,"This is a great action movie, bottom line.  I have read many reviews of this movie, and most are positive.  But I am finding a lot of reviews that are negative, and they seem to be written by people who are simply cynical.
So let this review speak to those cynical movie goers who have lost the imaginations they once had as kids.XXX is an inventive new spin on a great, old fashioned movie idea.  The idea of course is a secret agent movie.  Right from the beginning, Cohen lets us know he is nodding his hat to 007 when a ""Bond"" type agent in a tuxedo finds himself horribly out of his element at a Ramstein concert and is quickly killed off. From there the movie takes off on a roller coaster ride of awesome stunts, special effects, and ballsy adventure.For those of you who are knocking the special effects, take a moment to really analyze them.  All the effect sequences in the movie are totally on par with everything else out there right now.And, like it or not, the stunts in this movie cannot be ignored!  Many of the stunt sequences that look like they may have been CGI are ACTUALLY STUNTS.  The motorcycle jumping over the exploding barn is AMAZING.  There is no doubt that stunt guy got his eyebrows synged off!  Also, the end stunt when Xander is parasailing on a parachute attached to the speeding boat/missle.  I liked how Cohen added the suspense of the bridge coming up really fast, and Xander had to slide down the line, just barely ducking the bridge, to land on the speeding missle.  Those kinds of close calls and impending catastrophe really added to the excitement in the movie.  And it is PRECISELY that kind of inventivness that Hollywood so desperately needs! These are the sequences that were so horribly lacking in the MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE movies!Some of the cynics have also been knocking the dialogue.  But I found the dialogue to be fitting to the movie and substantive enough to keep me interested.  For example, the trademark ""Diesel Monologue"" during the corvette theft sequence.  Diesel is a great actor, and he has always been careful to choose rolls that allow him to put that talent first.  I also found his ""pithy comments"" to be surprising.  What I mean is, most of the time the ""pithy comments"" in movies like these are either ridiculous (like Schwarzenegger's have become) or obvious, like what Austin Powers does. (Yes, I know Austin is making fun of those lines, that is why it works in his movies.)  Diesel's comebacks and one liners are tough and clever.
The one stunt that stood out to me as being distracting was the motorcycle jump at the columbian drug dealer plantation.  Vin Diesel appears to be ""flying"" or even HOVERING on the motorcycle in one part.  I think that was due to a bad job of editing, but that was the only sequence I found distracting.And yes, as everyone has said, the avalanche sequence is the most exciting in the movie.  I thought the special effects in that sequence were very convincing and the flow of the action was extremely well planned and resulted in a edge-of-your seat feel.As an added treat, the end credits play out over an amazing, eye-popping 3-D extravaganza.  I have never seen an end credit montage quite like that one. The 3-D animation kept me glued to my seat, despite the fact that the movie was over.  It appeared to be a very expensive compilation, and that alone was worth the admission cost.  No one else appears to be commenting on this unique end piece.  It was really entertaining and very well done.TRIPLE X was TRIPLE GREAT.  This is a great ""Tough Guy Movie,"" and if you didn't like it, then you are a sissy.",xXx
124,miro-6,"Very good action movie, very bad acting",7,12 August 2002,"I was waiting for this movie very enthusiastic. I liked a lot Vin Diesel as in ""Pitch Black"" as in ""The fast and the furious"". I liked the direction by Rob Cohen of ""The fast..."" . I have to say that XXX is very well directed and full of great action.......but Vin Diesel has been a delusion. When I watched ""Pitch black"" I immediately said: ""This guy will become a star"". Today he is a star but his acting is not so good asI though at my first sensation. Off course he acts better than Schwartznager, but this is too easy. My suggestion to him is that: ""You get the face, you get the body, you are cool with a nice personality now you have to improve your acting"". Any case XXX is a cool movie and I recommend it to anybody who likes action movies. My rate to the film is 7.",xXx
125,JAKastner,Better then Bond but fails to be different,7,23 August 2002,"Vin Diesel quickly became the next big action star after racing street cars in the sleeper hit of summer 2001 called The Fast & the Furious. The movie had a surprisingly $40 million opening weekend and had legs that took the $38 million budgeted film to $140 million before the summer season ended. No doubt this impacted Vin Diesel's career. Diesel now returns to the action genre along with the director of The Fast & the Furious, Rob Cohen, to bring a 21st Century twist to the aging James Bond series. Will teenagers flock to this film like The Fast & the Furious or will this be Diesel's first major budget flop?The story goes that Xander Cage, played by Vin Diesel, is a man who lives on the edge performing death defying stunts like stealing cars, flying them off a bridge and then parachuting from the car to safety. Well, this time he has finely been caught by NSA Agent Gibbons, played by Samuel L. Jackson, who recruits him to be an undercover agent for the United States. If he does this then his criminal record will be wiped clean and he is free to go. Xander ""xXx"" Cage travels to Czechoslovakia to involvtrate the group known as Anarchy 99. As he digs deeper and deeper into the organization, he soon learns that millions of lives are on the line and he is the only one that can stop them. The story, much like those of the tired James Bond series, is moderately done though the film does not avoid the predictability that pragues the James Bond films. It has the typical sexy woman who starts off as the villain but is more then she seems. They also have the predictable one liners that don't do much to justify the character of Xander Cage for me. The story moves along pretty well throwing an action sequence here and there when the plot begins to slow down in any which way.Vin Diesel is xXx. He has the look of ""he was made for this role"" which plays extremly well during the movie especially during the action sequences. I would love to see Vin Diesel in more of these roles but wonder if he will be tight casted and not be able to expand into dramatic or comedic roles in the near future if he has the desire to. Samuel L. Jackson is okay as Agent Gibbons. He doesn't really stand out and not to mention his role is nothing more then a cameo. We don't go into depth with his character not that it matters with the story but it would help develop his character's purpose in the movie. Asia Argento is well received as Yelena. She plays the typical Bond, or is now xXx, girl who starts off as a villain but is more then she seems. Her role is nothing more then we have seen in the past, so I don't blame her acting ability for the lack of new excitement to her character.Overall, xXx succeeds at bringing new excitement to the spy series but does nothing new in the story line area. Most of the stuff in xXx's story has been done here and there thoughout every James Bond film and there should be something more exciting then what is presented to us. The action sequence are very well done except for the avalanche scene. The only problem I had with that scene was that you could totally tell that Vin Diesel was CGI and the graphics for the human character should have been done better. The loud metal rock music may be appealing to some teens but it just seemed too much for my taste in this movie. Vin Diesel does a good job and should do well in action genre films. I would suggest that he get into other genres before he is tight-casted but that is his decision on where he wants to go with career. Hopefully xXx2 will present something different from the typical James Bond film and not follow in its predicessor's steps.My Rating: ***1/2 out of 5",xXx
126,Blackace,Diesel Takes Next Step To Becoming Action Hero,8,24 August 2002,"After hearing that Vin Diesel would be doing a Xtreme style James Bond secret agent film, I was ecstatic. I feel that Vin Diesel has the charisma, cockiness, charm and acting ability to become the next Arnold Schwarzenegger. We all know that Arnold isn't the greatest actor in the world, so doing action movies like Total Recall, T2, True Lies & Conan should be a snap for Vin. Everyone is saying that Vin was a huge hit in The Fast in the Furious, but failed to realize that he was great in Pitch Black. I thought his acting ability in that film really paved the way for TF&TF & XXX. True..Saving Private Ryan was a great role for him too, but that was more of a cameo then anything else. As for XXX, its definitely a great movie to see. I think the writing was pretty horrible though. The plot of the movie is kind of lame, but the stunts and the chemistry between Xander & Yelena really save this movie. I can't say enough about the incredible stunts. The avalanche scene was spectacular and longer then I would have thought. The motorcycles stunts were also very well filmed. Of course these stunts were truly unrealistic. They look great, but in real life he'd be dead. The interaction between Xander and Yelena were pretty good, but someone needs to teach Vin how to do on screen kissing. Every time he kissed Yelena the people in the theater laughed. The other casts were pretty much fillers and didn't add anything to the film. Even the evil Yorgi didn't seem that menacing to me. He was more menacing as Borias on ""Xena: Warrior Princess"".Overall the movie is worth a viewing; on the BIG screen. Waiting for this movie to come out on DVD won't be the same. Unless you have a projection machine with a killer sound system, your better off seeing this at the movies. The explosions and sound effects are wonderful in Dolby Digital Surround. Let's hope that the sequel will spend more time on the script, dialogue and plot, then on the stunts. A few twist and a little bit of intrigue would be nice.  8 out of 10.",xXx
127,ericjg623,The next Sly or Arnold ..... ??,8,3 September 2002,"It's entirely possible. Vin Diesel has the biceps and, more importantly, the attitude to be the next really big action hero. In this movie he shows his stuff by portraying a new kind of tough guy, a Gen X rebel who's into anarchy and extreme sports and who can only be brought under control (and barely at that) by someone who's just as tough and has the benefit of far more experience. That someone is Samuel L Jackson, one of the few current major stars with the presence to pull off his role of a top secret NSA agent whose job it is to recruit talented scumbags and get them to work as spies. The tension between these two characters is terrific, and adds greatly to the fun of this movie. The plot of XXX is pretty basic, which is how it should be, since we don't want unnecessary complexity to get in the way of the action, stunts, and dialog. Once he's been recruited, Diesel's character, nicknamed `XXX' in honor of one of his tattoos, heads to Prague to infiltrate a group of, well, for lack of a better term, neo-fascist heavy metal anarchists with a secret plot to bring down governments across the entire planet using a sub to distribute some sort of deadly poison. This premise is, like most action movie plots, entirely ridiculous, but who cares? What makes this film work are the same ingredients that made Stallone and Schwarzenegger worldwide mega-stars, namely, great stunts, non stop high adrenalin energy, and a star who has just the right set of qualities, a combination of attitude, coolness under pressure, and a good sense of humor. Zingy one-liners delivered with just the right tone are, of course, de rigueur. The bottom line is that Diesel delivers the goods on all counts. This movie works for one simple reason  its star is the real deal, a guy with the self-confidence to take what could have been a hokey piece of schlock and turned it into a blockbuster. If Vin Diesel stays smart and focused, he could quite possibly find himself at the start of a long career that may rival the two abovementioned gentlemen.  8/10",xXx
128,TheArgentWolf,I hated it,1,3 May 2005,"I can safely say that I have never been so bored in my entire life. The film lasted, what? Almost hour and a half? After an hour, the plot line hadn't developed at all, and all I was seeing was the same thing over and over again, and quite frankly, it got pretty boring. So therefore I think that the script was badly written, and the plot line was wrote on the spur of the moment, and not developed on at all.I didn't think much of the cast either - they were all pretty weak actors. I even hated the lead, and the lead character is supposed to hold a film together - but he was one of the worst parts of it.To people who would like to see this - or see the sequel - I wouldn't recommend it, unless you want to be seriously bored for a few hours.",xXx
129,Uthman,"Cheesy sound, dialogue, and cinematography",3,16 September 2002,"This film had undoubtedly the worst sound mix of any big-budget action adventure film of the last 15 years. Submachine guns blare away, and all you hear is a whisper. The filmstock looks grainy and may even be expired film for the lack of decent color rendition. Vin Diesel, whom I liked in PITCH BLACK, was wooden, unconvincing, and unintentionally humorous as a romantic interest. Nor was his leading lady any help in this regard. Asia Argento didn't have near the appeal to pull off the female lead in this type of movie. The bad guy's plot to destroy the world was more laughable than anything Dr. Evil could ever concoct in an Austin Powers film. As for the musical score, I'm not sure if there was more than one song throughout the whole movie; it all sounded like the same ceaseless growling and screeching to me.Much has been made of the stunts, but in an era of seamless CGI, how does one know what is a stunt and what it computer-generated? At least in a Bond film of the 60s or 70s you knew it was real.My 17-year-old son liked XXX, but I think most adults, even those who enjoy action-adventure films as a guilty pleasure, would be well-advised to stay away.3 out of 10.",xXx

What's Samuel Jackson doing here? Did he lose a bet? Vin Diesel was quite at home among the beautifully illustrated, strategically pierced Eurotrash.  ""Why is it always the a-holes who pass the test?"" was posed by a regular agent about the motley collection of recruits. Is he referring to the screen test. But then  I thought Vin Diesel was a wine to be served with at tailgate parties. Everything about this film is beyond belief. The effects are brutal - I believe no animals were harmed in it's filming however a stunt double was killed- the dialog punishing - ""the things I'm gonna do for my country"" says Cage as he moves on a perky seductress- and the plot derivative - Cage is offered a get out of jail free card if he works for the agency. What's that smell?  A sequel perhaps? Nature has a way of washing clean our mistakes as Prague, the scene of this crime, is now half submerged.You won't fall asleep on this one unless you can snooze through an earthquake.

131,khouston86,only 2 reasons to see it: 1.to turn off your brain 2. to fantasize about Asia Argento,4,21 March 2003,"This movie makes it clear from the opening scene that thinking is not welcome.  It does so by presenting dialogue and posturing so phony that thinking about it is pointless.  It literally forces you to sit back and try to enjoy it.  And if you watch the whole movie that way, it is pretty enjoyable in a mindless way (even though, just to remind people, if you did anything important without your brain, the result would be eventual disaster).     The male mind is wired so that we can fantasize about women whether we are thinking hard or not.  Thus, watching the lovely, seductive Asia Argento for 2 hours is very enjoyable here.  In fact, she was really the only thing I liked about this movie, to be honest.  And, please, no one, no one ever try to claim that this movie is smart.

The idea is great, but the whole movie just feels so depressingly shallow, like Cohen's creative vain would have just dried up. The camerawork is boring and the angles destroy the action.

Vin Diesal is capable of better things, and he handles the action well, but why oh why does the director persist in showing us a stunt in 30 different angles. After 3 it gets old.

137,Steven Reynolds,Hideous,5,17 September 2002,"It's hard to imagine a film so awful you could describe it as a blot on Danny Trejo's resumé, but here it is.  I've heard Vin Diesel call this `the climax scenes from every action movie ever made, all rolled into one.'  He's right.  But writer Rich Wilkes and director Rob Cohen seem to have forgotten that a climax is only exciting as the payoff to something else: an engaging story.  And this isn't one.  It's tediously vintage James Bond, right down to the appalling accents, oversized Euro-thugs, M, Q, gorgeous bad girl, silly gadgets, laughable doomsday device, and the obligatory love scene denouement.  Either this is some kind of postmodern gesture or it's plain lazy writing.  I'll go with the latter, and the proof is in the viewing: it's boring beyond belief.  But at least the thumpin' soundtrack should keep you awake - that, and the macabre desire to see just how bad it can get. Along with the millions of dollars this will safely pull from the pockets of gullible teens worldwide, it should also garner at least one award - surely it's the unbackable favorite to take out the inaugural Razzie Award for Worst Editing.  The escape from the Colombian drug lords beggars belief.",xXx
138,RJBose,Action (Fast and Furious),8,18 January 2003,"This film does not have pretenses; it is a reasonable action movie in the James Bond ""Secret Agent"" genre, (with the added ""outcast"" twist well known from the ""Dirty Dozen"") but you know what you're getting when you rent this DVD (or at least you should). The movie serves as a star vehicle for the muscular and athletic Vin Diesel, and borrows liberally from the conventions of the ""spy"" movies of the James Bond type: evil Slavic villains, sinister plans for world destruction/domination, elaborate high tech devices, and even more elaborate,picturesque secret hideouts of the evil plotters, and (of course) an attractive Russian moll, who may or may not be what she appears to be. The plot is simple, if somewhat dopey, but servicable for the goal of inserting Mr. Diesel into the formula.  He is a renegade ""extreme athlete"" well-known enough to have a cult following around the world.  Threatened with incarceration in a Federal prison for his past and recent transgressions, he chooses to cooperate with the National Security Agency (which in real life is responsible only for intercepting, translating and analyzing foreign intelligence) in order to clear his record.  The theory is that Diesel's Xander Cage character will be more readily accepted by the targeted renegade gang of former Soviet soldiers operating out of Prague, in the Czech Republic, where previous attempts at infiltration have resulted in the agents' demise. The ""James Bond"" action which ensues contrasts the scruffy, gruff Diesel, (who is nonetheless affable) with the effete and smirky Bond of Pierce Brosnan.  (Diesel also cuts a much more physically fit and commanding figure than the skinny wimp from Ireland who is Bond's latest incarnation). Certainly some of the ""extreme"" action is a bit far-fetched, but that's what these movies are for.   The Diesel engine has arrived.",xXx
139,SamRag,Marketing is the key,7,15 August 2002,"When I first heard about XXX I didn't think much of it.  I had seen the Fast and the furious, and even though I felt it was a great entertainment, it didn't go down as something out of the ordinary in that genre.  But the hype including XXX has been unbelievable, which is either due to extremely successful marketing, or this film being great.  Having seen it, I go for the marketing as being the main reason.  It is true that XXX has everything that action film should have, good one liners, great action sequence, requirements to save the world, some romance and a hero.   XXX is nothing new though, and even though I'm sure Vin Diesel appeals to the younger generation, and has Humphrey Bogart voice, I think we should just appreciate it for what it is.

Maybe there were just too many little things that threw you out of the moment, from poorly faked belly tat's to a snow boarder out running a motorized vehicle to a Doomsday device that has to be right on top of it's target before it can fire a missile.  And the motorcycle and the helicopters scene  I haven't seen anything that sad since Keanu Reeves tried to ride a bike in traffic in San Francisco, talk on a cell phone and shoot a gun all @ the same time.  It is not just one person or one thing that makes this a bad effort, because there are several good elements, but there is so much potential, that the final product really brings you down.",xXx

142,bluzman,Lotsa Bond Action -- But None of the Style,7,18 August 2002,"Some of the hype I saw before going to see this movie said Sony was looking to create a franchise player like James Bond -- i.e. a vehicle for many similar movies.  To that end, they have failed.  The possibilities, like much of the plot and development of character is far too thin.  A tattooed, extreme game player with as coarse a persona as James Bond's is smooth seems very limiting.  What will he face next?  Nuclear-capable skateboarders or BMXers, drug peddling neo-Nazi bikers. I can't see him filling the man of the world role necessary to fill movie houses 25 times like Bond has. 
On the other hand, the special effects and general action kept my son and I sufficiently entertained.  Neither of us regret going, but, given the choice, neither of us would have chosen it over the next Bond film.",xXx

145,tom-darwin,Xander's a Xecret Xuper Xpy,5,8 April 2006,"The Cold War may be over, but the production of movies about superspies from supersecret, superdooper ""intelligence"" agencies seems likely to drop no faster than the national debt. This time the NSA, not content to just listen to our phone calls, infiltrates a band of vicious Russian mobsters peddling advanced weapons. When his agents all turn up dead, spymaster Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson, suitably scarfaced but awfully loud for a secret agency that specializes in wiretaps) carefully recruits an ""outsider"" that the mobsters won't be able to recognize. A series of action-packed tests eliminate (yes, eliminate) all candidates except Xander (Diesel), a genial adrenaline junkie & eco-environmentalist Robin Hood who films himself stealing from the rich & arrogant, then drops the loot off a bridge. This may be the first film to try to endow Xtreme Sports with social conscience, but, fortunately, it doesn't try very hard. Under Gibbons's tutelage, Xander learns the delicacy of spycraft and approaches the mobsters with all the deftness we have come to expect from 40 years of James Bond plus 20 years of Stallone & Schwarzenegger: zooming around in flashy cars, shooting up neighborhoods, beating up both friends & foes & bedding the all the babes. Xander's stunts, including a long parachuting/snowboarding act, make Bond look like Ironside. Diesel is as commanding & enjoyable a ruffian here as he was in ""Pitch Black,"" but without Riddick's grim baggage. He carries an action film with the Gen-X, in-your-face combination of confidence & cynicism that old-timers like Sly & Arnold could never manage and that no current action star has quite mastered. The film at first unfolds with mystery & intrigue worthy of an Eric Ambler story. That may have been accidental because the writers & director soon show as little interest in developing the story as they did in creating a title. ""xXx"" throws it all away with clichéd action orgies that go from silly to ludicrous. Xander's special revolver is much like Eddie Valiant's in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit."" His vintage GTO has so many ""options"" that you wonder why he doesn't just say ""Go-Go Gadget"" whenever he wants anything. By the end, with the death of millions only seconds away, you'll either be laughing or already dead yourself from brain oxygen deprivation. The film that might have really put a new spin on the old Bond model instead winds up a slightly enjoyable, overlong and forgettable big-budget actioner. ""xXx"" might have been campy if the spymaster had been a Peter Lorre type, maybe named ""Ignatius Spumati"" or something, rather than Jackson's tired urban tough guy named ""Augustus Gibbons"" (you don't even want to KNOW where he went to prep school). Maybe, for Diesel's talents to really shine, he needs an action film that busts the genre as effectively as ""The Terminator"" did. With Hollywood still bent on remaking every profitable film & TV show from the last 50 years, Vin may hang it up to run for governor somewhere before he gets a chance.",xXx

147,easmith03,Dialog is just something to fill in the gaps between explosions,4,3 January 2003,"This movie reminded me of a Gen-X version of James Bond.  The plot seemed to be an homage to the Bond series of movies, including a line by Xander ""The things I do for my country"" said into the camera, just before getting into bed with one of the villain's girls was almost a copy of a scene from a James Bond movie.  Also, the arch criminal has a ridiculously complicated, and expensive plot he is developing.  (Almost Austin Powers-esque)  He has dozens of people working for him, extremely high tech equipment, security, contacts etc.  The old ""One of the worlds most successful businessmen wants to wreck havoc on the world.""  However in this case the US government has already lost too many agents trying to crack this one, so they just kidnap a 1/2 criminal, 1/2 gonzo journalist, 1/2 extreme athlete, Xander, and pretty much force him to infiltrate the bad guys.  Xander is famous enough to be recognized by the bad guys for his extreme exploits, but doesn't raise in other suspicions as he begins to investigate what they are up to.  Naturally Xander is able to do things that none of the regular spys could hope to accomplish.  Using his extreme sports skills he can jump mini bikes 40 feet into the air, while firing a gun, can operate the host of high tech weapons given to him by 'M'... oops I mean another agent, can parachute, out race an avalanche on a snowboard , and can do it all while making smug comments dodging bullets, and almost constant explosions.The movie is definitely for action junkies.

This movie is obviously the set-up to a long franchise designed to replace dear-old-James-Bond who has, unfortunately, run out of steam long time ago. One last quick note, suspend your disbelief at the door before entering the movie house... some twists to the story do not make sense, to say the least....

I hear Bond fans talking about the ""mindless action"" and I'm wondering what they thought of DAD. At least this movie spends the first hour or so developing the plot before it jumps into the action. And Vin Diesel, in spite of appearances, is an accomplished actor with a better resume than Bronsnan. Much of the negative reviews are based on form rather than substance. And that said, at least you don't see XXX wearing nothing but a tuxedo in zero degree temperature or driving a $500,000 invisible car that the gov't paid for. And there isn't a long drawn-out fight with a supervillian with explosions going off all around them. Imagine actually shooting the villain with a sniper's rifle instead of doing it that stylized Bond way! And Vin Diesel actually looks concerned and worried many times during the film; maybe if he threw in a smirk or two or a one-liner while the scientists were being gassed Bond fans would be happy. Or maybe if the villain had diamonds in his face or a bullet in his brain which will eventual kill him (but is making him stronger in the meantime!!!), Bond fans would be able to identify with him.

In fact, it has more action than the last 2 James Bond movies combined, while actually paying homage to the James Bond genre, which having been around now in movies for 40 years was way, way overdue to be given a makeover for the 21st century and handed over to a younger generation.  Yes, there are several critics who call the plot of this movie dumb -- they either conveniently forgot that a great many matinee action movies aren't to be watched for intellectual forays into what lurks in men's hearts and souls (these movies are made to be fun like an amusement park ride), or they never went to many Saturday matinees when they were younger.  And the plot in this movie isn't any worse than any James Bond movie script, period.   The icing on this cake (yes it's all eye candy, and I just couldn't get enough) is that unlike dozens of other fantasy/action flicks, the actors are all good in this one -- and especially unlike some James Bond movies, the main female love/spy interest is not played dumb.

Shortly after he is abducted and reluctantly trained by the NSA before being shipped off to Prague where he falls in with(small spoiler) a group known as Anarchy-99.

He had some great potential showing in things like ""Boiler Room,"" but he apparently felt that he found his niche in films like xXx, where lines are really corny and go something like: ""Do you want some ice before your brain overheats?"" It's a shame.This movie (movie, not film: film implies it's more sophisticated) threw away any opportunities for acting by making the characters larger than life (by a scale of about a trillion% ), so any potential care for the characters was instantly eradicated.xXx, in the opening act, offers Diesel's character as a, for lack of a better term, badbutt rebel (how original). He is then forced by Samuel L. Jackson (in one of his worst vehicles) to use his power for good (how original). Then he gets with a girl (how original). Then he saves the world (haven't seen that one before). In fact, the only potential way this film could have been good was if it had been a satire on action films, but sadly that wasn't the intended goal.I must apologize: I haven't begun to even scratch the surface of this blatantly unoriginal movie (the only more unoriginal movie was its sequel, xXx: State of the Union, because it copied everything the first did plus the first). Then, not only is it unoriginal, but it copies everything ""bad"" about other movies. Vin Diesel is a waste of potential talent, and the movie is bad.

168,EJBaggaley,A cheesy wannabee 'James Bond' film!,5,10 December 2004,"The film xXx is the poorest excuse for an action film I have ever seen. I admit this film had a few good scenes (ie.When Xander Cage/ Vin Diesel parachuted from his car, when his car came off the bridge and when the avalanche was following Vin Diesel while he was skiing down the ski-slope) for the stunt work in this film was fantastic, but overall this film was a shallow Hollywood Hype that only a poser would enjoy. Vin Diesel is the most Idiotic so called 'Actor' I have ever seen in Hollywood. Not only his acting was dreadful in this film, but he has no originality and persona of his own. A least actors like Sylvester Stallone and Jean-Claude Van Dam have their own characters, but all Vin Diesel is, is a mish-mash of all action actors 'In one'. To sum Vin Diesel up, I'd put him on the same level as Mr.T and Steven Siegal as they too are nothing but muscle-bound thugs that pose themselves through Hollywood. At least the film 'If looks could kill/ Teen Agent'(A James Bond parody) with Richard Grieco had aspects of sophistication in it, but unlike the film xXx, this film had no sophistication, whatsoever, for the directors of this film tried to make xXx into a new age sophisticated American James Bond sequence, but instead became a boring and ridiculous poser film. Who knows - if the directors of xXx changed the storyline around and chose somebody other than Vin Diesel to play the role of Xander Cage, like Tom Cruise or Christian Bale, maybe this film would have been something worthwhile, but unfortunately this film was a joke.

170,Gareth_Hacking,Boring,1,23 January 2003,"This bored me. This truly did bore me. It bored the people I watched it with. We all agreed it was one of the worst films we'd seen this year. Why did this happen? XXX was supposed to be the future of action films, `better than Bond'.The film opens with a dig at Bond when a spy wearing a tux is easily found and killed by the bad guys in a Rammenstein gig. We then are introduced to Xander Cage who is apparently an extreme sports legend. We (the audience) know this because he jumps off a bridge and Tony Hawks (not the one who dragged a fridge round Ireland) and Matt Hoffman kiss his ass. He has also never sold out' which we know because a busty businesswoman tries to get him to endorse his own computer game (something the two above have made a fair few dollars from doing). I won't go on as you probably know the rest. I thought that Diesel was good in what I'd previously seen him (Saving Private Ryan, Boiler Room) but here... There's a speech he delivers saying how he guessed he was in a tested that, for me, was like nails on a blackboard. Plus the way his mouth was almost permanently hung open reminded me of a chimp. When he kissed Argento for the first time it looked like he'd never done it before in his life.Characters I could care about also would have helped. It is two days after seeing the film I can't remember any of their names beyond Xander Cage. Our bad guys are basically a main evil baddie, a muscleman, his even bigger brother and a sharpshooter. There was absolutely nothing memorable about any of them. Also, a cardinal sin of action films is to be unexiting. Another is to not convince you that the hero is in danger. There were a few times when it was obvious that a shaven-headed stuntman who looked nothing like Mr Diesel was falling through the sky. The biggest problem was the heavy reliance on the very Bond formula this film is trying to surpass. The hard-ass boss for the hero to banter with, the beautiful women, the eccentric inventor and glamorous locations are all present and correct. I see there's a sequel on the way. I will not be looking forward to it.",xXx
171,hoju_31,drivel,1,27 March 2009,"Where do I begin? Let's start with Vin Diesel, shall we? His acting was astonishingly bad. There had to have been cue cards just off screen, there's no other explanation for that level of ineptitude. The NSA recruits a criminal to go on a mission? Apparently that agency doesn't require security clearances anymore. Also, as someone who actually does work for a government agency, the CIA or DIA does the kinds of things he does in the movie, not the NSA. I can overlook mistakes like that in a mindless action movie however. What I can't overlook is when action scenes start breaking into Matrix territory. I enjoy mindless action scenes as much as the next guy, but when they break the laws of physics several times over while ripped off James Bond music plays in the background, it becomes hilarious, and not in a good way. Even if, by some miracle, this was a great move, I still wouldn't be able to get past Diesel's acting. He makes Keanu Reeves' ""performance"" in ""The Matrix"" look Oscar-worthy by comparison.",xXx

This is a leave your brain at the door and enjoy the eyecandy kind of movie.Just 2 complaints, the build up to the character Xander Cage becoming a secret agent was terrible. I did like that whole scene in the diner though.

174,masonx,disappointing,1,2 October 2002,I am prepared to give Vin Diesel the benefit of the doubt as far as his acting abilities. It is incredible that he once auditioned for the part of the transvestite in Flawless. A part eventually played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. However if he expects to be the new Arnold Schwarzenegger perhaps he should wait for another vehicle than this overblown over hyped artless piece of moviemaking.

176,Justin Harris,It's got nothing on Bond,5,28 December 2002,"Vin Diesel. I thought he was great in BOILER ROOM. I remember thinking, he's gonna be a huge star, a great actor. But then he goes on and does THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS and this film, XXX. Neither films which really required acting talent on its part. So we're presented with XXX, a supposed new breed of secret agent. Is it as good as the JAMES BOND franchise? Of course not. Is the story interesting? Not really. Are there plenty of action scenes to keep one entertained? Well, yeah. But aren't there a hundred movies just like it? Of course.This film is pretty bad, even for an action film. It has absolutely nothing on James Bond. Quite honestly, it's one of the worst Bond knock-offs created. Now I like Vin Diesel and think he can still do good movies, but with movies like this and the inevitable XXX sequel... dear no. Go see any JAMES BOND movie or THE BOURNE IDENTITY rather than this recycled garbage.SCORE: 5 out of 10 (average)",xXx

I am also a big fan of Vin Diesel because he is in my opinion a great actor. I also liked how this movie related to some of the previous action movies that I have seen. For one it really relates to some of the James Bond movies because their is always a hero that never gets killed. Vin Diesel also reminded of what he was like in the Riddick movies, it seems he was always the guy flying around cutting bad guys to shreds. I really like this movie and advise anybody who loves action movies to definitely see this one. It is a trip to see Vin Diesel in a mountains of explosions.",xXx

I mean, I like metal, I like Rammstein, but the soundtrack is just too loud. It kind of smothers everything and there are no quiet moments in between to relax.2.: There's nothing but action. Okay, I knew that before, but there aren't any quiet scenes. So after a while the action gets boring. And usually I like action-movies.3.: Ever heard about characterization? The villain remains bland, uninteresting and not really threatening. The same goes for his companions as well as - well - everybody else in this film, including Asia Argento and Sam Jackson. You just don't care about the characters.4.: The acting s*cked. Okay, Sam Jackson plays his usual cool, but he hasn't got much screentime, so he can't save the film. And Vin Diesel? If I didn't know he can do better (like in Pitch Black, Boiler Room or Multi-Facial, even in TFATF he was better!), I'd wonder what he is doing in Hollywood anyway. Okay, the script is very weak and the stupid lines the actors have to say make a good acting difficult, but he just isn't convincing. I like Vin Diesel, he was the reason I wanted to see this movie in the first place. But in this movie his acting is really bad. And the kissing-scene with Asia Argento is totally unerotic.5.: There is no suspense or else of any kind! The plot just plays along without any highs and lows. There are no twists, no surprises. Everything is forseeable. And the stunts? Yea, they are good, but do they have to show 25 times how Xander flies through the barbed wire on his motorbike? Once or twice would have been enough. And the avalanche? It was okay, but...The film is not totally bad though. There are some scenes in it which are totally funny, and some of the one-liners Diesel's got to say were really cool, but those couldn't save the movie for me. And the credits were cool. But I think they should have saved that money and put it into a decent script instead. And maybe Vin should make his next films with a different director where he can show more of his acting ability. There are more people out there than just 18 year-olds, and just action without a decent plot gets boring pretty soon.All in all it is a movie which you can watch once, but that's about it.",xXx
179,tenn-noodlehead,Not as Good as we wanted it to be.,7,8 August 2002,"Okay, we were really looking forward to this movie.  After Pitchblack and the Fast and the Furious, we were anxious to see Vin Diesel in an all-out action role.  He does do that and does it in true tongue-in-check action hero fashion, but this was mostly a rehash of old material.  It didn't really do anything new or special.  It is a great late night hbo romp or good weekend matinee movie, but we expected so much more.",xXx
180,wezzel,007 shouldn't be afraid,7,3 November 2002,"XXX suffers from the worst fate any movie can have. Mediocrity. I wish I could say it's just a big, dumb, bad action movie. But that would be unfair, cos for most of the time I was really entertained. There were some very thrilling action scenes (the avalanche was well done, just like the bridge stunt) and the plot was a 'best of' every Bond movie you've ever seen. Now it would also be unfair to call it a good movie. The acting, on all parts, is far below average. Vin Diesel doesn't seem to be able to speak one convincing line in the whole movie. Asia Argento should stick to the movies of her daddy, and the villain was a carbon copy of (again) every Bond villain you've ever seen.I'm not sure if I like the idea of Diesel becoming the new action hero. He has some screen presence allright, but he doesn't have the 'je ne sais quoi' of Ah-nuld. Ah-nuld rules by the way (before XXX began I saw a teaser for T3, so I'm in an Ah-nuld mood, sorry bout that). Anyway, Diesel was good in Fast and Furious (a movie way better than this one)but I really don't think he's leading man material.If you want to go to XXX, you'll probably have a fun time, but chances are you'll start to forget the movie before the end credits role.

182,tombstone81,At least you're SUPPOSED to laugh at Austin Powers!,4,4 February 2003,"I can only plead with the script writers for XXX not to try and remake ""Monty Python and The Holy Grail"" and cast Vin Diesel as Gallahad or King Arthur.  They botched this Bond rip-off so bad I can only imagine what they'd do to the aforementioned comedy classic.  Basically, a bunch of drunk & stoned twenty-somethings decided to make a younger, hipper Bond movie and apparently wrote the script on the inside of a greasy pizza box.  This film has no idea where it's going from ground zero.  Vin Diesel essentially copies every Bond move, except on a Generation XXX scale (replace the skis with snowboards, the Aston-Martin with a '67(?) GTO--that apparently changes colour from black to blue to purple to burgundy (BRUTAL CONTINUITY!!)--and the hot sexy Monte Carlo babe with a poorly accented Euro-Goth).  I can't believe IMDB voters have actually settled on a 6 for this movie...or that someone who has gained the respect of Hollywood as a decent actor (Samuel L. Jackson) would lent himself to this tripe.  Vin Diesel tried too hard to upstage his success in the Fast & The Furious by actually pretending to act in this movie...and it failed miserably.  F&F worked because he played the cool, strong silent type...a much better role than a secret agent who's ""witty & intelligent"" quips come off more like a chimpanzee attempting Hamlet.  Save yourself the rental charge on this one and rent a classic, real James Bond movie...or watch the Fast & The Furious over again...or simply watch Austin Powers where at least when you double over laughing you know that you were supposed to be doing so.  A 4 on my scale only for the explosions and the GTO (I'm a muscle car fan and loved the '70 Charger in F&F).  Take out the GTO in this one and we're looking at a 2.",xXx
183,Shrykespeare,Just enjoy it!,9,2 June 2004,"I have read all the bad comments about XXX - knocking the movie's unfounded comparisons to the James Bond films, slamming Vin Diesel's acting ability, charisma and screen presence, and thoroughly lambasting the film's cookie-cutter Euro-baddies and illogical story line.You know what? You are all correct. And you know what else? I couldn't care less.Comparing Xander Cage to James Bond is like comparing the Incredible Hulk to Superman. Both are comic book ""heroes"", but they have little in common. Bond is suave and debonair; Cage is muscular and quite throughly un-handsome. But it really doesn't matter. I went to XXX with no illusions about what I was going to see. I expected a 100-minute-long music/extreme-sports video, and that's what I got. And I was entertained every step of the way.When I was a teenager, I enjoyed all the lowbrow Arnie movies that came out (Commando, Raw Deal, Running Man); you watch them now, and you wonder for a moment why you like them. Then it hits you; because they are simple, good-guy/bad-guy shoot-em-up entertainment. And that's why XXX works; sometimes you need to watch a movie where you can just enjoy it without having to think too much about it! There comes a time in everyone's life when one, for the most part, grows out of movies like that. I will still go see the occasional lowbrow shoot-em-up, but not as often as when I was younger. Sometimes I am entertained, and sometimes not, but that's the risk you take with any movie. In this case, I was entertained. Very much so!It's a bad pun, but there are two kinds of films: movies with action, and movies with acting. If one goes to a movie and expects one thing but gets another, they will be outraged, and pepper this website with negative reviews. My advice to them: just enjoy it! How can one watch the scene where X snow-surfs down the mountain just seconds ahead of the avalanche and not go ""Whoa!"" That alone was worth the price of admission!In this day and age, all movies will be analyzed, dissected and scrutinized down to the microscopic level - that's a fact that won't change. But as far as this movie is concerned, I say only this: put the magnifying glass down, park your butt on the couch and enjoy XXX; a campy, overly macho, thoroughly implausible, completely enjoyable romp.My score: 9 out of 10.",xXx

185,pmoney13,"run of the mill, and pretty boring",4,25 August 2002,"Vin Diesel proved with Pitch Black that he could carry a film on his broad shoulders, but XXX just isn't a worthy ""breakout"" role for him. The film is being hailed as a James Bond picture for the next generation, but fails to give us anything different. The film isn't really bad at all, just somewhat dull. It's a movie in which every action scene and every plot device is one that has been used in hundreds of movies before, so we basically know everything that will happen in the movie, therefore it really isn't that exciting. Let's see some originality, some inspired filmmaking. Diesel has the charisma to be a major action star, but let's get him in something better. When you have a popcorn action movie like this, there are two absolute essentials you must have to pass as quality entertainment: good villains and memorable one-liners. XXX strikes out on both of these counts. The villains are typical slimy Euros who talk under their breath and glare so that we know that they are evil. The best action movies have great villains, and that usually means having a recognizable actor in the villanous role. Here we have a bunch of no names. Where's John Malkovich? Or Christopher Walken? The one-liners are bad, very bad. ""I want all this...in here"" doesn't exactly rank with ""Yippie-Kay-Yay Mother F***er"" or ""Hasta Lavista, Baby"" in the annals of great action film quips. Without these two elements to raise it from the rest of the pack, XXX is basically another toss-into-the-pile spy flick, a forgettable vehicle for it's star, Diesel.",xXx
186,gutterbox20,decent film!!,8,21 August 2002,XXX wasn't a bad film.  it was pretty good!  vin isn't in his acting prime here but the action pretty much compensated for that.  the movie was a little predictable but it's all good!  this type of movie is usually what is expected of guys to go see but surprisingly there were 5 times as many girls as guys in the theatre and that's no exaggeration!!  the soundtrack is killer!,xXx
187,Dolemike-2,Perfect Summer Movie,7,8 August 2002,"I got a pass to see XXX. I was going to pay to see it, so I was glad I got the pass. Going into it, I expected a big, loud, dumb action movie with more style than substance. I was right, and the movie was quite entertaining thanks to the great humour involved. That's where the problem lies: were they trying to be funny with the ludicrous stunts and cheesy one-liners (i.e. was this a well-done spoof of the spy genre)? Or was it actually trying to be a good movie, that happened to be so stupid it was funny? You can see how that line can be kind of blurry, but I'm willing to give the filmmakers the benefit of the doubt. So, if you're just another moviegoer, expecting nothing more than thrills, chills, spills and kills, XXX is the perfect summer movie. Expect nothing more. 7/10",xXx
188,cossallpsycho,A mixed bag...,7,4 November 2002,"First of all I'll go through the bad aspects of this film. At the top must be Vin Diesel. I was a fan of his after Saving Private Ryan and The Fast And The Furious but his performance in this is mind bogglingly bad. Its the same with Asia Argento. The only good performance in it was from the ever brilliant Samuel L. Jackson who can't help being cool for every moment of his life. But maybe the performance would have been half-decent if it had not been for the dire, unimaginative script. You cannot make a movie out of a string of overused, badly timed one liners. Again the best written part of the script belonged to Mr. Jackson. Overall it was pretty cliched. Now to the good...the one redeeming feature...ACTION! The action scenes were immense. The Columbian Cocaine attack was a bit stupid when he manages to hop over a fifteen foot fence but Rob Cohen definately knows how to shoot an action scene. My personal favourite was the snowboard/avalanche chase which actually got me involved...of course it all went down the pan when he finished off with another crappy one liner but the effects were impressive as were the action scenes overall.I didn't much care for any of the characters and the plot was predictably predictable but as mindless action it is about as good as it gets (ish).",xXx
189,jmuntmootcourt,"Not exactly smart entertainment, but fun.",6,2 March 2005,"Look, I'm not going to pretend that this is some sort of masterpiece. Though it is basically another ""generic action flick"", the twists that they add to it make it worth watching. The way they incorporate their ""recruitment program"" into the movie is fun and original, and though Vin Diesel doesn't really ""act"" in it, it's a lot of fun to watch. It has a few suspenseful plot elements, and the way they incorporate his status as an extreme sports star (not a spoiler, it's in the previews) into the way he conducts himself as a secret agent makes it more believable. Ever think about some of the stunts that go on in an action movie and wonder, ""Okay, exactly WHY would this particular person know how to do that?"", because it seems completely unlikely that there would be some sort of training program for the stunt they just pulled off? This movie doesn't have that, because whether he's on a motorcycle, skis, or whatever, you can believe that an extreme sports star would be able to pull off what he's doing. Though the plot is as unrealistic as most movies of this genre, the stunts are a lot more believable than you'll find in most.",xXx

Problem is, when you finally do...you wonder what the big deal was because she's got no personality and is as boring as an insurance sales convention!!  And not as pretty as you thought she was, either!This movie is all marketing and technique and loud annoying German techno-metal, but there's nothing cool about it!  How can that be when you're talking about a movie about an extreme athlete who becomes a secret agent?  I have no idea how, but they've made it lame. You get the feeling that the movie was spawned during a meeting of studio execs when some ""genius"" had the idea of a guy outrunning an avalanche with a snowboard.  They just needed a way to fit it in a movie...the result is an remarkably boring and overwrought piece of dreck, and also one of the five most fake movies of all time!  A heat-seeking missle homing in on a cigarette?  C'mon now, this is utterly absurd!  Maybe if they had tried to make the movie a little more fun, a little more tongue-in-cheek, it might've been okay.  But it takes itself way more seriously than it ought to...and the result is derivative and laughable.

192,chasman99,Base Action thrills,7,24 January 2003,"If you want substance...of any kind...rent something else.  Even Bond flicks have some conflict.  The plot between Vin and the rest of the group is weak. I was all over the idea that an X gamer, no fear guy would make a great secret agent.  Here's the problem.  Ever watch the X games?  Those guys don't look like Vin Diesel.  Picture Vin on a BMX doing tricks.OK, now stop laughing.  Don't get me wrong, the movie has what you expect it to.  Lot's of explosions and some good dialogue.  Vin does need to work on his comedic timing as his one liners are usually flat.  His tone of voice changes so little you don't get the full effect of the humor.As for the stunts there were a few issues.  They were set up as great and conceivably they could be.  The Avalanche shoot was a great idea, but it wasn't believeable enough.  I don't expect to believe it but I expect to be convinced it doesn't matter that it couldn't happen.  When the snow is 2 feet from Vin and he just started?  Well, that doesn't work.  Had the avalanche closed in on him ever so slowly there would have been more suspense.There were two majorly glaring weaknesses.  1) Am I supposed to believe that Vin cares about anyone?  Let alone people he just met?  A little character development would have been good here (maybe a friend stuck in jail while he serves God and Country)  and 2) the death rocket that gets launched.  My son has made more threatening looking things with his tinker toys!All in all, if you want explosions, it ain't bad.  It tries to be Bond...suave, subtle and confident.  But it needs to be hard core, edgey and full of obvious attitude.  This needs an R rating.  The real X game and thrill junkies are ""R"" people themselves.  Don't downgrade them for the sake of the folks out there with no adrenal glands.  Make a mad rush movie about mad people with balls the size of Cleveland.  That would work better.

I was prepared to let these thingsslide and just enjoy the action and fun. For that reason, I highlyenjoyed the film, giving it an 8.One special point to note here is that Xander Cage, our hero, hasa surprisingly low body-count in the film when compared againsthis contemporaries (the older Bonds would have low BCs, butPierce Brosnan is nocking up 50+ per film these days).As stated everywhere, the stunts are pretty huge (some way overthe top), and potential viewers should go in with the expectation oflaughing at the ridiculousness of it sometimes, but this is a prettyfun action film!",xXx
195,JesperT,Really going downhill for Mr. Jackson,2,26 April 2004,"In terms of movie-budget Vin Diesel may be moving upwards from the absolutely awful The Fast & The Furious to the just as awful xXx, but that is about as positive as I can be.xXx's plot is pathetic, and it cannot match even the worst James Bond movies in terms of realism (and at least they can boast some level of originality). Since it isn't a James Bond spoof either then this just isn't worth spending the 2 hours on. There are no twists, turns or surprise twin brothers, only straight forward action with a lot of stunts, explosions, avalanches and bullets being fired that can hit everyone, except for Mr. Diesel.Vin Diesel plays an extreme-sport fanatic that is signed up as a government agent, but adds little depth or emotion to the character. His best performance was definitely still as the voice of the Iron Giant :-)
Maybe it is intentional, but then the directing leaves much to be desired, and judging from Samuel Jackson's performance then this may actually be the case. I always considered him a good actor, but I am drastically reviewing my opinion.Gone are the days of Pulp Fiction and 182 and there seems to be only lame big-budget action flicks left for him (and yes, I would say that Star Wars 1 & 2 fall under that category as well). It has really started to go downhill for him.Overall I give this a 2. It's still not the worst movie of all time, but I'm just getting too old for this.",xXx

His ways with women was incredible and other than that theaction was mind blowing.

197,Spud1000,"Enjoyable action film, but by no means a classic.",6,20 October 2002,"One fact that will be very apparent to anyone who watches this film is that this is another attempt to put a fresh face to the James Bond genre, in this case by using the extreme sports craze as a starting point. The references range from the subtle to the (more often) blatant. For instance, the opening scene features a spy in a tux wandering into a Rammstein concert and getting spotted easily and shot.All the Bond cliches are there in vast quantities. This film has gadgets, the supervillan with the mansion in the hills complete with underground laboratory, a car with rocket launchers behind the headlights, walls that spin around to reveal an arsenal, the spymaster talking through a video phone, the list goes on.This all begs the question what new this film has to offer, as everything else has been done so many times before. The only real thing it has is Vin Diesel, which is a hell of an asset when it comes to it. Sure, he's not going to win any Oscars but this isn't what this film is about. This guy has a very fresh brand of style, which anyone who has seen the Fast and the Furious will be familiar with. In that respect, he is perfectly cast. Even if he looks nothing like his stunt double...And that's about it besides a lot of explosions and some over-the-top stunts. Enjoyable film yes, but I don't think that Bond is facing any real competition here.",xXx
198,Einsiedeln,"Nice stunts, but overall weak.",6,13 August 2002,"Although Vin Diesel has a great deal of star power, he needs to choose his new roles better, in my opinion.  ""XXX"" was hackneyed, poorly scripted tripe which had the slight benefit of decent special effects and lots of explosions.  The production design was lame, the costuming decent, and the character interaction laughably bad.For a good spy thriller, catch ""Alias"" and skip ""XXX"".",xXx
199,loopydate,*Yawn*,3,9 August 2002,"*SLIGHT spoilers ahead, probably nothing you didn't see in the trailers*I remember the first time I saw the trailer for ""XXX,"" I turned to the friend I was seeing whatever film the trailer was in front of (how's THAT for weird syntax?) that I wouldn't expect a plot out of that movie, but the stunts looked cool.As the release date drew closer, and the ultra-cool Vin Diesel (who I still think is the best bad-ass since Samuel L. Jackson) made the press circuit, I was starting to warm to the idea more and more, so when the aforementioned friend decided he wanted to get a ""crew"" together to watch ""XXX"" tonight, I was in.So, I went in not expecting a plot and, boy, was I not disappointed. However, the sheer asininity (is that a word?) of the ""story"" was almost like an emotional vacuum, sucking away my ability to stare slack-jawed at the action like Cletus from ""The Simpsons.""The only (and I mean ONLY) redeeming quality of this film was the stunt work.  The opening sequence, the motorcycle-helicopter chase, and the gunfight after gunfight after gunfight were all pretty cool, but without a semblance of plot to hang these on, they just seemed like Rob Cohen's excuses to get people to ""ooh"" and ""aah.""They have been calling ""XXX"" ""this generation's James Bond.""  If that's the case, I hope my generation reconsiders.  ""XXX"" had good stunt work, but the best spy movie of the summer is still ""The Bourne Identity.""*OK, here comes a pretty big spoiler.  Stop reading if you don't want to know how it ends (like you don't see it coming anyway)**Be absolutely sure you don't want to know how it ends**I'm about to tell you**Stop reading NOW if you want to be ""surprised**DO NOT READ BEYOND HERE IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS**OK, I warned you*One question:  Why did Samuel L. Jackson have so much faith in XXX's ability to defuse ""Silent Night?""  We were given no reason to believe that he could handle something like that.  Here's how it would have made more sense...[XXX harpoons himself onto Ahab.  SLJ turns to the Czech police.]SAM JACKSON:  Call off the jets![He watches XXX approach, that dumbfounded look on his face.  He turns back to the Czech police.]SAM JACKSON:  Never mind!  Blow the damn thing up![And they do.  The end.]Unfortunately, the wonderful master-of-physics screenwriter helps XXX figure out that putting a missile in backwards makes it blow up!  Is that true?!? I don't see how it could be, unless the firing mechanism is in the back of the missile itself, and not in the sub.ALSO, what the heck did Yorgi have on that boat that caused it to blow up like an A-bomb upon impact with that cliff?And did the cinematographer get a new tripod for Christmas or something? That had more static shots than any action film I've ever seen.  The movie I made with my friends this year had more dynamic camera work, and it was all done on a DV cam handheld by college students.  We didn't have a $100,000,000+ budget to throw around, and I think ours beat this movie for cinematic skill.And the acting was better.But, I'm getting off-topic...Anyway, DON'T see ""XXX"" unless you really, REALLY don't care about plot, shot sequencing, acting, or...well...a film.  Go see ""The Bourne Identity."" Or, if you have to see a sophomoric spy film, see ""Austin Powers 3.""  At least ""AP3"" was intentionally funny.  And Dr. Evil was an infinitely better villain than Yorgi.And there's talk of making this a franchise.  Please, Rob Cohen.  Don't do it.  Vin Diesel's cool, but this movie was not.  Vin, get yourself a gig as Juggernaut in ""X-Men 3"" or something.  Do NOT make the sequels.  And Mr. Cohen?  Try a romantic comedy.  Or, if you want to make ""this generation's James Bond,"" see if you can't get yourself a job on one of the future Bond projects.  Once Pierce Brosnan hangs up the vodka martinis, get the guy that played The Professor in ""Bourne Identity"" (whose name escapes me right now. I know I'll kick myself later when I remember it) to play Bond, and revolutionize the genre from the inside rather than trying to assert yourself in a saturated genre.I gave this movie 3 out of 10 stars, because when it comes out on DVD, if you just skip between the action sequences, you'll have a damn good time watching it.  Maybe even watching the whole thing with the MUTE button on would be better.  Better yet, get some friends together, turn the volume low, and do a ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" knock-off.Just DON'T spend $7 on ""XXX.""  Please.",xXx

The bridge is real, and they really did run that gorgeous thing off it, man attached.",xXx
201,Joekingfans,Triple Testosterone,10,10 August 2002,"I've seen all 20 of those James Bond films, and ""XXX"" puts them all to shame!As far as Action/Adventure movies go, in ""XXX"" the Action is hotter, the sex is hotter, the humor is funnier, and Vin Diesel is much more masculine that Sean Connery!  This is a much better movie than those classic Sean Connery Bond flicks.I prefer Van Diesel's performance of Xander Cage even to any of the Action/Adventure roles of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvestor Stallone.I grew up in the 60s, and the American spy films such as Dean Martin's Matt Helm franchise, or James Coburn's two Flint movies were ""cool,"" but they were never quite as good as the actual James Bond films.Thus far, I'm finding the 2002 spy films, ""Minority Report,"" ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" and ""XXX"" to be much, much better than the James Bond films.The coming attractions trailer for Eddie Murphy's ""I Spy"" also looks like it will put the Bond franchise to shame, as well.It wouldn't surprise me at all if the latest Pierce Brosnan Bond, ""Die Another Day"" doesn't even come in first place at the Box Office.MGM should begin sending out an ""SOS,"" because all the cookie cutter Bond films are so locked into that James Bond formula that it's just ""Same Old Stuff,"" ""Same Old Stuff,"" ""Same Old Stuff,"" ""Same Old Stuff....""The fact that People magazine named Brosnan ""Sexiest Man Alive"" this year means little more to me than being named ""Employee of the Month.""Let's face it, James Bond shouldn't be played by an actor who keeps turning down invitations to join the AARP.Vin Diesel and Sean Connery also have something in common: They're BALD! It really works for Vin Diesel, but I'm sure if a woman had a romantic dinner with Sean Connery, she'd keep dropping hints about how he looks so much better with the hairpiece on.The premise of ""XXX"" about an ordinary fellow being suddenly swept into high profile espionage reminds me of Cary Grant's adventure in ""North By Northwest.""Cary Grant was the first actor considered for the Bond role, but would agree to do only one film.  Too bad the producers didn't take Cary Grant up on that--but it was all about money.  (They want you to agree to do 3 at once so they don't have to pay you as much for the second and third one.)I'll be back to see ""XXX"" in the theater tomorrow.  There's something about watching the film with an audience that's much more satisfying than waiting 6 months to watch it again when the DVD comes out.There's bound to be a ""XXX"" sequel.  If it were up to me, I'd title that one ""XXX: NC-17!""You'll enjoy ""XXX.""  I give it four stars.",xXx
202,zach-27,We're in the Xander Zone!,7,20 August 2002,"Unbelievable, extremely loud, yet funny and exciting, I urge you not to miss ""XXX"" while it's showing on the big movie screens, which is where it is especially designed to be fully appreciated. Vin Diesel, who portrays the iconoclastic Xander Cage, is truly a 21st-century secret agent, complete with smart-alecky witticisms, machismo, Generation X/Y swagger, and surprising sensitivity.  I don't care what the critics say, this is one impressive flick - photographed by Oscar winner Dean Semler (""Dances With Wolves""), I was was pleasantly surprised by the overall craftsmanship this work displays.  Yes, the stunt work is over-the-top, but it's all fast-paced and totally absorbing.  I really forgot about my everyday problems as I got swept away by the action and adventure led by Messrs. Diesel and Samuel L. Jackson.  Like the incredible avalanche set piece, you too will be overwhelmed by the power of ""XXX,"" and if you're not careful, you'll find yourself forever in the Xander Zone! Don't miss it!",xXx
203,joits,disappointing...,4,26 August 2002,"all i can say is that if vin diesel wants to be the next arnold then he has to find himself another director to work with cos rob cohen isn't the director who will take him to the superstar level.  this movie was just your standard average movie and nothing really made it stand out from other action movies.  lots of action scenes and explosions yet it doesn't make you jump out of your seat in amazement, you've seen it all before.  this movie even makes fun of james bond in the beginning but that's just because its jealous that the 007 movies are a lot better in several departments such as the acting, plot and action scenes.",xXx
204,McHenry,Pretty juvenile...,3,9 October 2006,"Did anyone else notice the RPG - type weapon that the Vin Diesel character uses near the end? Did you happen to see that it's simply a modified SONY camcorder? How cheesy is that? Was the props budget running out by then or what? This movie was I think the beginning of the end for Vin Diesel action career. He did well in Saving Private Ryan, but then for some reason started to shoot down his own credibility by accepting action roles that only barely pubescent males would appreciate. Too much implausible action with too little substance. Someone earlier compared it to James Bond style. At least 007 films have a story.",xXx
205,saykeng,I learned something interesting & useful from this no-brainer movie!,7,12 August 2006,"I love watching action movies, even if some of them are no-brainers! My purpose of going to the movies is very simple: firstly, to be entertained within a span of about two hours, & secondly to pick out some interesting & useful ideas.Triple X is one such action movie. The plot is very simple: An extreme sports renegade (with no fear but has a bad attitude), Xander Cage (played by Vin Diesel), is recruited by a NSA big shot, Augustus Gibbons (played by Samuel Jackson), to spy on & then foil an attempt by a nasty group of Czech criminals, known as Anarchy 99, & led by a crazy villain, Yorgi (played by Marton Csokas) who had some nutty ideas to change the world using a biological virus, called Silent Night.The many high-octane action sequences (cars, bikes, skis, boats, helicopters,...), all the way from the opening scene & the attendant rampant explosions, plus all the state-of-the-art weaponry, including a super-duper Bond-like vehicle, in the movie are quite fun to watch. The dialog is witty, too. For example, in Prague, while Xander was about to go to bed with a sexy girl, with compliments from Yorgi of course, he remarked: ""The things I'm gonna do for my country."" Among others,there is one particular dialog, between Gibbons & Cage, during the first half of the movie which strikes my personal attention.When Gibbons offers Cage a job to work for the US government, with a view to redeem the latter's crimes, Cage turns him down flatly. That's when Gibbons tells him the story about the difference between the eyes of a lion in captivity & the eyes of a lion in the wild.This also reminds me of an insightful dialog between Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) & Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) in one of the earlier scenes of the movie, Rocky III. (In contrast to Triple XXX, Rocky III is an intelligent movie.) The movie tells the story of how Creed convinces & retrains a down-&-out Rocky to go back into the ring to fight against Clubber Lang (Mr T) who had earlier gave Rocky a thorough bashing in humiliating defeat. In that particular scene, Creed tells the story about ""the eye of the tiger"". Creed desperately wants Rocky to regain his focus quickly in order to win. Incidentally, this is also the title of the movie's signature tune.These are certainly interesting learning points, especially in terms of understanding life (or survival) skills. I often share these stories with teens who are searching for directions in life.In summing up, I have enjoyed watching Triple XXX & learned something interesting - & useful - along the way.",xXx

But not that bad if you just turned on the TV on a sunday afternoon and have nothing else to do.In the end, this is what there is most of in our world today.

207,flying-monkeys,Diesel Powered Spy Flick,8,1 September 2002,"As an avid fan of the up and coming actor Vin Diesel I was totally stoked to see his follow-up to The Fast and the Furious. I was extremely pleased. I felt the plot was pretty good, typical of most spy flicks but felt it was rushed at some points and jumped around a lot. I enjoyed the actors' characters and felt they all did a good job portraying them. However, the writing seemed to be lacking something. Some of the humorous lines weren't funny and a bit over used, in my opinion, if another actor had portrayed X some of the lines would not have went over at all. I felt Vin played this character very well and it was very believable to watch him in many of the movie's action scenes. I didn't feel overwhelmed by computer generated action either which was nice. Most of the stunts/scenes are quite believable.I think most people will enjoy this movie as long as they go in expecting an action flick, not some thought-provoking, deeply moving film. It's not the best movie ever made but it can definitely hang with the big boys of the Bond series and spy genre. I feel this is a good performance from Vin (he keeps getting better and better) and I can't wait for his next film, Knockaround Guys.",xXx
208,per8,not enough action and too intellectual,2,12 September 2002,"How can people say that this was a good action film?For one thing, the lead, Vin Diesil, is such a wuss!  He constantly cowered before the bad guys and seemed to be in utter fear throughout the whole film.  It would have been nice if he just fought back instead.  Also, the Neil Diamond inspired soundtrack put me to sleep.  Vin is scrawny, he obviously needs to spend more time in the gym - I don't think he was in very good shape before starting this film.  Also, the moves he did (during what little action there was) seemed clumsy and things that my 85-year old grandma could do.Why didn't they just put Samuel Jackson in the lead role!  He would have kicked butt and added some real action during the snowboarding scenes. 
The overly-intellectual dialog was over the top.  C'mon, this is an action film, not ""my dinner with Andre"".  There was too much exploration of the pathos of eastern Europe, long-winded speeches about world peace and epicurean phenomonalism - I mean, who cares?  I may as well just go watch Mulholland Drive with a bag over my head so that I won't be able to figure out what's going on.Also, I think they over-did the homoerotic subtext - I don't have anything against that - but I wonder if mainstream audiences are ready for it.The film could have used a greater variety of gear - instead of just the usual car chases.  For instance, there was not ONE SCENE that used a jet ski, when one could have been obviously used during a certain part of the movie that I will not reveal here because then that would give away the ending to the movie and I don't want to do that because although it didn't have enough action I don't want to ruin it for anyone else that wants to see it.Per A.

209,mdonath,Moronic writing brings it down a few notches,3,28 July 2005,"Vin Diesel is surprisingly good in this move. The Italian girl is nice as well. The Prague location is a great choice. Some of the action shots are inspired. The direction is bad, but that doesn't sink the film.The problem is with the writing! It's beyond idiotic. Even with the assumption that they are shooting for the low standards of a James Bond movie, the writing is so pathetic that one wonders if they were actively trying for a Golden Raspberry. BTW, the Razzie nomination xXx did get was for ""Most Flatuent Teen-Targeted Movie"", and it lost. Rich Wilkes must be wondering just what kind of merde he needs to produce in order to get props.",xXx
210,hubcap18,Best action movie I've seen in years!,9,24 August 2002,"This is one excellent action movie! The only action movie I've seen in recent memory as good as this is the more plot-driven The Bourne Identity. As for the plot of XXX, I'm not sure I could accurately explain it, but in movies of this type the plot is usually secondary. There are a whole lot of explosions, gunplay, Bondian gadgets(band-aids wired with explosives), and high-tech weaponry. Much of the movie is set in the Czech Republic. The best scene is one in which Xander Cage(Vin Diesel) tosses a couple of explosives over his shoulder in a very snowy mountain range, deliberately causing an avalanche to thwart the villains chasing him while he snowboards away. I was just captivated!However, no movie is without problems. For one thing I didn't see The Fast and the Furious, but based on this picture, Diesel can't act at all, it was just painfully bad. The dialogue was also awfully corny. Even the usually clever one-liners (often uttered after defeating a villain) fell flat.
The two above minor flaws are what lowers this movie from a 10 to a 9. Keep an eye out for brief appearances by rapper Eve, skateboarder Tony Hawk, and German techno/heavy metal group Rammstien, who contribute a song to the typical high-octane action-movie soundtrack. If you love action movies(and don't mind bad acting), you MUST see this one.",xXx
211,jareinhardt,Not a classic but very enjoyable,8,18 August 2002,"I went in to see this movie with my 17 year old son.  I knew going in that it wouldn't be a masterpiece & it didn't disappoint me.  However, I found myself enjoying it. Mr. Diesel will never be a Tom Hanks or even a Michael Meyers but he has presence.  The camera likes him & so do all the teens.  He is definitely a man's man.  Everyone had to admit his is cool & very likeable.  His delivery of dry humor in the one liners doens't work & should be re-thought out.  However, I found myself believing him as a spy. An American spy.  Go to see this movie and just sit back & enjoy the action.",xXx

Things move along at a good pace, and you don't have to think about it too much.So to recap, those looking for Oscar winning performances & a story that will leave you thinking about it for days, this isn't for you - but if you want something you can just switch on & not have to engage your brain, then this really could be for you.So if you like the Running Man, Under Siege & similar types of movies - check it out & get yourself the soundtrack!",xXx

No. Don't quote me on that. Quote me on this: the movie was VERY stupid. Now, I don't mind stupid. Hell, I love stupid. The right mix of stupid and bad-ass can make for very rewarding viewing experiences (ie, 2004's The Punisher). Unfortunately someone forgot to throw in the bad-ass in this. Just like Cohen's previous effort The Fast and The Furious, xXx panders mainly to the Limp Bizkit crowd. Who could have known you can't write ""poseur"" without three x'es?Infusing the soundtrack with embarrassingly bad hardcore, Cohen lets you know immediately you're in for a particularly annoying ride. A ""regular"" Bond-like spy is assassinated (at a Rammstein concert, of all places!). Nice symbolism there, Rob. Out with the old, in with the new, huh? Superspies don't cut it anymore people, we'll need... EXTREME SPORTS JERKS!Especially painful is that he has three pretty charismatic leads (although Diesel's no Dwayne Johnson) and a capable villain.

215,szhsub,Could be even better,9,26 April 2005,"The title of this movie is a little bit strange (as it is rating/code for adult movies) but the popularity of this movie has helped in changing the impression of the term/abbreviation ""XXX"".The main character Xander Cage (XXX) is amusingly eccentric and true definition of ""bad in attitude but good in heart"". The character is perfect for Vin Diesel.The movie gives a very powerful impression of Xander Cage (XXX) in its beginning. Xander Cage (XXX) is rude, a bit proud and practical fan of extreme sports but surprisingly intelligent. His physical abilities and intelligence make Agent Gibbons to get XXX as an NSA Agent.The character Yorgi was also very interesting and he did best as villain. A perfect villain is very necessary for a good action flick. Hope to see this actor in more movies.As the summary says this movie 'could be even better'. Provided the power of leading character, the writer could provide us with an 'even better' story and plot twists. There are some turns in the story which are kind of silly or too simple. But as an Action movie it is perfect if not best.There are some modern-day James Bond movies which have actually bored me but XXX never did so.

I liked him in the Fast and the Furious, but I liked the cars even more. He does a very good job in this movie at playing the bad cop, and I like that role. The special effects and explosions and such were awesome, and probably took a lot of work and time to perfect. The stunts, though most of them are almost physically impossible, were well choreographed and came out looking great. True to form, there are some awesome cars in this movie too, which kept me hooked. I would recommend this to fans of action films and fast cars, because you will find lots of both in this movie.",xXx

It's not like the old days of Commando or Rambo. This movie brings that era back just a little bit. Although it's not an acting masterpiece, it is a roller-coaster ride of action and fun surprises. VD is no James Bond but he is definitely a rough and tough action star. The special effects were great although some of the action was very unrealistic. I liked the gadgets used in the film, which is what makes if feel like a Bond movie. There was a moment in the film where I had a Fast and Furious flash back, but I let it slide. Vd is up right up there with Arnold and Stalone in my book of favorite cheesy action stars. The movie has it's repeat value, meaning I can watch it over and over again.

219,spselecter,A truly tense film.,10,23 October 2002,"This film is action at it's best! Although Vin Deisel showed a poor performance, I went to watch this last night because I am a great fan of Samuelle l Jackson, a few of my favourite's are 51st state, shaft and I'm sure these will soon be greeted by his latest film. But unfortunately I was half asleep the whole way through although I jumped a little at the scenes with him in, sadley he was no more than a character actor to my liking.It is a bit corny in parts, but the action doesn't help it. I can't say this is amoungst the top 10 favourites of mine, the plot is spectacular but it needs tweeking just a little first of all they should have made Xander a reluctant secret agent (which I expected anyway), also to be honest they should wipe out the whole machine destroying the world thing. Which is stupid.There isn't much to say about this film, but I will say that if you like the idea of your ear drums exploding go and see it, if not wait for the dvd and turn it right down because it's rather worth watching even when you take off it's many faults. 7.4/10",xXx
220,spselecter,Taking James Bond one step further!!!,10,26 October 2002,"The creators of ""xXx"" have taken the tired old James Bond formula and successfully revamped it for new audiences. This is demonstrated in the very first scene of the film where a tuxedo clad secret agent is pursued into a head banging club in Prague. There, he stands out like a sore thumb and is promptly shot and killed. It's rather symbolic of what this movie is trying to do. It has the basics of a James Bond film like exotic locations, impossible stunts, cool cars, gadgets (even a Q), and beautiful women. But it throws in new twists like extreme sports, more modern music, and attitude. Lots of attitude. In the end, it's more entertaining than recent 007 flicks.If you're a fan of action films, then you'll love this movie. ""xXx"" has several show stopping scenes including an explosive chase at a Colombian drug processing plant, a chase on a mountain between Diesel on a snowboard and some snowmobiles in an avalanche, and a gunfight in a castle. Another clever action scene features Diesel and Argento chasing a runaway boat in his GTO. They attempt to stop the boat while reading the instruction manual in the car that describes all the newly installed gadgets. Not only was it amusing, it added an extra edge to the chase.Vin Diesel is his usual bad self. This role was definitely tailor made for him. As much as his cocky attitude is unappealing to me, it fit the character just fine. Xander Cage has the potential to be a cool long running action anti-hero. Samuel L. Jackson is kind of cheesy as NSA Agent Gibbons, but again it's his attitude that makes him fun in this film. (It's ironic that in recent Marvel Comics they've been depicting Nick Fury, Agent of SHIELD to look just like Jackson. That's exactly his character in this film minus the cigar and eyepatch.) Asia Argento also does a fine job as the first Bond Girl.er.X Girl. She's both tough and sexy at the same time and more than a match for Diesel.The locations are cool and the music is a strange mix of Czech heavy metal, dance music, and even opera. It all comes together to give the film an exotic feel. Another interesting note is that the final credits are probably the most elaborate I've ever seen. While James Bond opens with dancing naked woman visuals, ""xXx"" closes with elaborate CG that you'll probably want to stick around and watch. Overall this is a fun moviegoing x-perience and a great popcorn flick.I know this is going to make me sound like an old fogie, but here goes. First off, I didn't care for a lot of the heavy metal music. I generally don't like ""songs"" where there are guitars set on 11 and blaring with a guy incoherently screaming ""lyrics"". That describes half of this soundtrack. You may be into that sort of thing, but it didn't suit my personal tastes. I did like the rest of the soundtrack a lot, though.The sound was turned up just a bit too loud, too. I knew it was going to be a problem when, in the opening scene, the sound of one guy knocking another into a door blew my eardrum out. Thankfully the high frequency buzz left ringing in my ears muffled a lot of the rest of the cranked up sound. Bring your earplugs.Finally, there are a couple of moments where the movie seems like it's begging to be accepted by its target audience. Cage rails against a senator for attempting to outlaw skateboards, video games, and music. It's so preachy that it's laughable. Then we're constantly reminded that Cage loves snowboarding and he learned to shoot guns by playing video games. It seems so desperate to connect with teens that it doesn't realize that it's unnecessary. They're going to think it's cool anyway.In the end ""xXx"" is a fun action adventure and a cool new entry to the spy movie genre. I look forward to seeing what they pull off in a sequel. 7.3/10",xXx
221,SILV3R,Bond-Lite,7,18 October 2002,"Rating: 12A Stars:  Vin Diesel, Asia Argento, Samuel L Jackson Theme:  Secret agent action adventure Language/Nudity/Violence:  Moderate language, scantily clad ladies, loads of extreme violenceBig bald black guy with an obvious dislike for authority and a propensity for hobbies most would class as ""more than a little silly"" is forced to work for the government he so regularly and deliberately irritates.  And that's pretty much all the plot you need to know.  Guns, gadgets, cars, bitches (I'm quoting), bangs, maniacal sociopathic mastermind criminals and testosterone levels so high that your girlfriend may leave the cinema as your gay lover.  What more could you possibly want from a Friday night?The easiest comparison to make is the one that the xXx publicity machine has been using to generate hype, James Bond.  The writer and director have had 19 Bond movies to use as a reference library, and some of the choice cuttings are obvious.  The opening scene celebrates the death of the old guard with the killing of a tuxedoed secret agent who slips from back streets into a club.  But this is not a champagne reception, rather a European industrial thrash metal gig. The Bond-esque agent falls from the stage after being shot, right onto the moshing crowd.  A prolonged shot of his dead body being bounced aloft lets you know the movies intentions from the outset.  There is a regular stream of references throughout the movie, including the obvious two fingered salute of a parachute decorated with an American flag (thankfully the only stars and stripes this movie contains). xXx  wants very much to be the replacement franchise.While comparisons are apparent, there is also the deliberate differences, highlighting just how alternative xXx is.  The unbeautiful cast - Diesel is not the typical pin-up model and his 60 Marlboro Reds a day voice is certainly not the velvet Queen's English of James Bond, the conspiracy theorists version of the NSA is far removed from Bond's government department and the soundtrack is more street than Albert Hall.  Q, excuse me, Agent Shaver is taken out of his mad professor's house and actually given some field experience.  Jelena is alluring but no Halle Berry. Bang for your buck, the explosions far outnumber the exposition, although there is very little you will need explaining.  Even the appearance of Xander Cage (6'2"" Vin Diesel) is the polar opposite of Bond, tattoos on top of muscles on top of attitude.  His coat is stolen from a Hollywood pimp and the rest of his wardrobe is borrowed from Bruce Willis' Die Hard collection.  Even his choice of car is designed to show that he is not part of the Bond generation.  Out of a line of Ferraris, Lambourghinis and other European super machines, Xander chooses the American classic GTO (and to any other humans being he has clearly made the wrong choice, but he seems happy with it) .The acting is passable, Asia Argento is probably the best, and has the critical European acclaim to back up her ability.  Jackson isn't stretched and Diesel is Diesel, the same way that Arnie is Arnie.  The narrative is unimaginative and the dialogue is laughable.  And it just doesn't matter. For all its failings xXx is entertainment and not pretentious enough to even claim anything else.  At just over two hours, its about the right length and packs more stunts into its duration than an audience can rightfully expect. The stunts are big too, really big, and so much fun to watch that you are grateful for the multi-angle repeat shots.  They're even more impressive because, thanks to a little clever CGI, Diesel's face can be seen as he throws motorbikes, cars and himself around like hacky sacks.This re-teaming of Rob Cohen and Vin Diesel, having had great success with The Fast and the Furious, is going to make people money.  It will have at least two sequels, hopefully with a different writer.  It will make lads around the country more than content for a couple of hours at the weekend. And I'm sure there are a fair number of women out there who aren't going to mind watching Diesel's body for a while.  With an obvious inspiration, a couple of cameos (Eve, Matt Hoffman) and a couple of bizarre references (the theme tune to The Third Man being the most obscure), xXx is entertainment of the most mindless order.  Bond movies are a genre unto themselves and they remain in their own company for now.  This film, and potential franchise, shares borders with Bond, but never quite reaches its territory.  While the King retains his title, the crown prince may have been found.  Not a replacement, more an alternative, and certainly an acceptable filler until Die Another Day next month.Mark:  7/10 Who to go with:  The lads.",xXx
222,Hellmao,Poor XXX,4,5 November 2002,"In the opening sequence, a spy dressed in 007-outfit, is shot during a ""Rammstein"" gig in a cave-like setting. What could have been a nice reference to this ""James Bond, make way for something new"" idea is completely spoiled when the movie imitates every possible James Bond item including a Q-character presenting a car with special gadgets. Much of the stuntwork is spoiled by extensive repetitive slow-motion, hysterical cutting and surprisingly poor special effects (i.e. the avalanche). The ""good guy"" on the run on a motorcycle, chased by the bad guys and the bullets hit the ground in two lines to the left and right for half a minute. Boring. About the plot - okay, that's not fair. And now the man: XXX has big muscles, big tattoos, some fashionable rock star equipment and is fashionably bold. He kicks on adrenaline and himself, he hardly speaks more than one sentence and has a range of one and a half different emotional expressions. He is a pain in the ass for everybody and very quick in breaking secret service clerks' noses, but he is politically supercorrect, fights the evil because he does not find it nice if many innocent people get killed and smoking is dangerous, of course. The only thing missing is an MTV-tattoo on his chest. Anyway, probably one of the contributors to the message board is right by saying: ""This is America."" XXX II or XXXX or whatever the sequel may be titled has probably supporting roles for Britney Spears and Fred Durst and a plot around a dangerous new drug from terrorists on Jihad. My suggestion for Vin Diesel: take some acting lessons, get some hair - and please, change the coat.",xXx

Move over Arnold and Sly, there's a new kid in town.I really wanted to give this film a rating of 8 in the genre of action film but the database doesnt separate between genres as such. I gave other films such as ""As good as it gets"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" a rating of 8 and overall ""XXX"" doesnt measure up to those standards (It's like eating the best cotton candy you ever had in your life, you might rate it a 10 but its STILL just cotton candy)for these reasons, and wanting to preserve the overall integrity of the database rating system i gave ""XXX""7 of out 10 stars",xXx

OK, let me begin by saying that if you have any faith in the ability of Hollywood and Rob Cohen to generate a quality product, go see XXX.  Triple X Starring Vin Diesel and Samuel L. Jackson is the enchanting tale of X-TREME sports star Xander Cage, the ultimate bad boy complete with menacing scar, witty catch phrases, and KUNG FU GRIP! By a strange twist of fate, Xander ends up being drugged and enlisted in the services of Samuel L. Jackson, to be James Bond.  In this realistic setting, being James Bond means being Vin Diesel. The last time I checked, James Bond jumped a dirtbike over an exploding fence while tending to his equally explosive libido with another bond girl.  Some people may tell you not to see this movie because the stunts are next to impossible, and completely outrageous.

Your turn in Saving Private Ryan was an example of what a good actor could do with a very small part.  Pitch Black was a suprisingly suspenfull horror flick. Everything else you've done since that time has been, not only dissapointing, but flat out awful. XXX is the worst of the bunch.  None of the actors make an attempt to perform here.  Perhaps it's because they realize how moronic their lines really are.  Samuel L Jackson, such a solid actor, must have needed money to take on this colossal piece of schlock. People, stop going to see movies like this so they'll stop making movies like this.  Force good actors like Jackson and Diesel to take on challenging projects that might just be worth seeing.",xXx

Every move Xander Cage makes is the exact opposite of what James Bond would do but with the same results. Everything this movie attempts is pathetic. The extreme sports, not ""selling out"" (by making a video game??), defiant hubris in the face of authority, every last thing. This is the perfect James Bond parody. Everything about the movie is James Bond except for the lead character. This review really isn't serving the movie justice at all. If I could, I'd go through the movie scene by scene. OK You talked me into it.Intro- Spy in tux using a gadget tries to escape from bad guys by running into a Rammstein concert(with pyrotechnics and body surfing). Big mistake James, you're in a tux. You stand out! Oh well, they kill the James Bond character and we're immediately introduced to......XANDER MOTHER F____NG CAGE. SOME SENATOR WANTS TO CENSOR VIDEO GAMES AND MUSIC??? XANDER'S GONNA STEAL HIS CAR FROM THE VALEY AND DRIVE IT OFF A BRIDGE. I know, you're bored. How about this- He has a parachute and jumps out before the car crashes. Doesn't appeal to you enough? He does it live on the ""World Wide Web"" via a ""Web cam"".Also he doesn't drink anything except juices or vegan meals, but he thinks tattoo's and doing extreme stuff is pretty awesome. He is a non-smoker. Get with the times Bond James Bond! Would James ever punch Q in the face? I didn't think so.WATCH THIS MOVIE.

XXX is filled with the standard corny one-liners you always see in action movies, but in this one Vin Diesel gets to deliver most of them.  He's about the coolest guy on the planet right now.  And the stunts looked great - like Vin really was jumping off of a car falling off of a bridge or outrunning an avalanche (great sequence, even if totally unbelievable).  If you loved the ""good"" 80s and early 90s Schwarzenegger flicks (or if you could recognize Tony Hawk in a crowd), then you'll love this movie.  Definitely 95% entertainment (meaning it's meant for the 95% of moviegoers who wouldn't know a Bergman film from a Buñuel film), but it's also a glimpse at how big Vin will become.",xXx

It has a typical action/adventure plot, but the action in non-stop. This film contains lots of things blowing up, and some spectacular stunts. Jumping over an exploding building on a dirt bike, and out-running an avalanche on a snowboard. This film is a must for all action/adventure fans.

I almost walked out of ""xXx"" at least five times but it wasjust so unfathomably bad that I was glued to the screen out of pureshock.  Aside from probably the least-sexy screen kiss ever, Vin Dieseldoes little to distinguish himself as an actor in this vehicle.  Hislines are delivered as though being read off cue cards.  The plot isinsipid, predictable and, surprisingly, even dated (aside from thenotion of biological weapons -- no, wait, that's been done beforeand better, too).  Not a single element in this movie aside from the inclusion ofevery imaginable ""extreme"" sport is anything that hasn't alreadybeen included in a Bond film.  Ironically, the first scene in ""xXx"" isdesigned to let the audience know they are NOT watching a Bondmovie.  It's a tongue-in-cheek (if mean-spirited, like much of therest of the film) nod at the Bond franchise that suggests this movieis going to go places Bond would never dare.  Well, if goingsomewhere completely lacking in class and wit is where theyintended, that is just about the only fresh ground covered.  Sointent were the producers on out-Bonding Bond that they ended upcreating only a pale, inexplicably illogical, dull imitation.  If all aviewer wants is to see some cool extreme sports stunts, renting aspecialized video ought to be a much more fulfilling experience,especially since the stunts will be real and not riddled with editinggimmicks and digital enhancements.",xXx

That was so cheesy.  Men find that sexy?  Okay...Maybe he should try another genre.  A genre where his character isn't trying too hard to be macho or the toughest guy in the room, and believes he is. As a woman, it really turned me off.Vin is somewhat of a newcomer.  So, that explains his part in this movie. But Samuel Jackson?  He has proven he's better than this.

He should stick to some roles with less speaking.You will find some parts of the film entertaining, like when the completely wooden barn explodes into a ball of flames as if it had been laced with glycerine, or when Vin is seen wearing a Yeti whilst walking around Prague.The stunts although quite spectacular at times were really over the top and would have done better if strung together onto a video of it's own entitled ""Just stunts"".",xXx

Vin Diesel is extreme sports athlete Xander Cage, pressed into the service of his country by Agent Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L Jackson).  The movie is a perfect vehicle to allow Vin Diesel to demonstrate his considerable acting talents.  The role plays on his ability to make you truly believe that he is capable of performing the incredible stunts.  He is not afraid of being shown as flawed though, and to allow other characters to be more knowledgeable.  The bad guy, Yorgi, who is the leader of a group of ex Russian soldiers called Anarchy 99, is played by the wonderfully sinister Marton Csokas whose agenda is slightly different from the usual Bond villains.  There is no preamble - the movie goes straight into the action. The rock music soundtrack helps make this movie the best one of the decade so far!",xXx
240,SeriouslyMike,Stupid as every super spy movie. Fun as every super spy movie.,7,6 April 2005,"*sigh* So, there we have a new breed of super agent. Beefed-up wise guy with anarchistic tendencies. That's who Xander Cage (Diesel) is - and hell, I like characters like that. First: we have an insane terrorist threatening the world with a prototype WMD. Overdone to death. And that organization name... ""Anarchy 99"" - who the heck invented this one?! I understand that Rob Cohen was on that anti-globalist hype and bearded guys in woodland cameo don't necessarily sell well, but anarchy has no sense whatsoever. Second: we have spy gadgets - not too little, not too much. The GTO is somewhat a pastiche or parody of ""super spy car"" - and that's planned. Three: we have evident mistakes, ie. Prague is shown being close to snowy mountains and and a medieval castle while in fact it's not - not counting the second motorbike escape scene it could be fixed with adding some travel scenes. Four: not all characters are played on equal level. Yes, you can fall in love with Asia Argento (I did ;) ), Samuel L. Jackson as Gibbons is nice to watch and Vin Diesel as the ""tough-cookie smart-ass"" is okay too, but Marton Csokas as Yorgi is terribly cheesy. I don't know if he was told to act like a mad villain from 60's movies or did he screw it all up himself, but he's irritating.To be honest: it IS stupid, but which super spy movie isn't? I think only ""The World Is Not Enough"" tried to be quasi-realistic, but this is a matter for another discussion. Anyway, XXX is stupid and that's why it's fun to watch.

242,Melanie82-1,Overall great re-release with one exception,6,10 September 2009,"Well folks here we are again. As with all Hollywood movies that spawn a sequel, a re-release of the original movie is usually a precursor to the new film. The re-release is usually peppered with shameless tie-ins to the new film, and ""xXx: Uncensored Unrated Director's Cut"" is no exception. This release is, however, does have advantages over the original release. The most notably being the 8 minutes of extra footage not seen in the theatrical release. Anyone who has the original DVD will recognize the additional footage as the deleted scenes from the first release. This might not seem like much of an improvement but the movie flows so seamlessly that its hard to spot the new footage and it does add to the overall tone of the movie. This release is a two disc set, with the typical making of and stunt featurettes that are a staple of action movies such as this. The release also includes the trailer for and a sneak peek at the new film. There is also a short that I consider to be the one notable blemish on an otherwise great re-release. WARNING: If you are a big fan of this film like me, and do not wish to permenantly damage your opinion of this movie, I highly recommend you give serious consideration to watching the included ""The Final Chapter: The Death Of Xander"". As the title implies, this short tells of Xander's ultimate demise and is designed to bridge the two films. This short might not have been so bad had it not been for the gruesomeness and finality of our hero's death that leaves almost no chance for a surprise return. One wonders if this short was retribution from director Rob Cohen for Vin Diesel not doing the sequel. In conclusion, if your still reading, the re-release of this film is an improvement over the original with the additional footage but some of the bonus features are something to be desired or hated. Just depends on how big a fan you are.",xXx

What I actually liked about Vin Diesel (don't get me wrong, please) was his neck. It (his neck) had style. The rest.. is up to you.The stunt with the Chevy was disappointing. What p****d me off most, was that they've been showing it 4 so long, as if it was a masterpiece of action, like ANY of James Bond intros. But please..I do, however, have respect 4 those fellas, who did the motorcycle stuff (it wasn't Vin Diesel himself, I presume). The pieces were great, but the stunts never make a movie - rather it's a good movie, that shines even brighter with some STUNning gems in it. And this one is dim :(I maybe would have said more, but I didn't watch the rest and went to see 'Minority Report' instead. A decision I did not regret ;)PS 1: I'm only sorry 4 Samuel L. Jackson.

But only one of them I had to wait to catch on DVD.XXX was a film which I'd heard mates raving about - supposed to be better than Die Another Day - which was going to take some doing.One thing is for certain: Xander Cage takes one look at his US oppisition, Jason Bourne, Jake Hayes, Kelly Robinson, and blows them all away.This leaves one man: Bond, James Bond - who(as mentioned earlier) came up hot in DAD.So how do things match up?1. Neither film slowed down. Evens so far.2. Graves was a better bad guy than Yuri. Bond one up.3. Cage has by far the classier weapon(THAT gun is what I would want if I was a spy) and so pulls evens again.4. Halle Berry is fitter than Asia Agento. 5. But the XXX soundtrack edges DAD.6.

246,peter-c-odlaug,Should've Been Scrapped,1,31 January 2003,"For the love of God why did Hollywood make this?  Why did anyone think that this movie was as good as people I've heard talk think it was?There will be some spoilers so be warned... The premise of the film, punk no-good-nick gets offered spy job in lue of jail time, succeeds in upsetting superiors, doing away with the bad guy and getting his woman seems like an alright idea on paper and the shame is that it could have been good on the screen as well. The script lacked any qualities of being a worthwhile effort for its writer(s) with bad attempts at one-liners and technological spy linguistics. Also, the inconsistancies of the plot shine through without effort. Example: Triple X blows up the bad guys motercycles and a car at his castle/manor after escaping from the underground lab.  The bad guys girlfriend (who's actually a secret agent for Russia but the bad guy ""knew all along"" supposedly) manages to make it from the underground lab (when Triple X is already well on his way on a motercycle) to Triple X's safe-house to save his life by somehow managing her police buddies (The 2 Ivans) and still having time to get to the safe-house less than one min. after he arrives. Another amazing feat is the arrival of snow crawlers seconds after an avalance buried a building and Triple X in a remote mountain location. Simply amazing.  Russian special agents and snow crawlers must have transportation magic. Vin Diesel's performance was almost worthwhile.  He tries so hard with the material given but neither he nor Samuel L. Jackson can salvage the movie sadly. The movies' makers had their minds stuck on one summer movie formula throughout this film it seems.  Blow up a LOT of stuff (i.e. cars, buildings, cocaine fields), get a small army of almost naked women dancing, an actor who looks like Kevin Spacey with long hair to play the villain, a guy with muscles, a decent looking lady, make sure they have some acting talent and you'll have a movie that kids will shell out money for at least once or twice and you can make a sequel or two out of it.Vin Diesel's last words in the movie as Triple X sum up my feelings for this film ""You gotta be kidding.""",xXx

I have a feeling that the writer has watched his share of Bond movies, and you can definitely see the influence, including a great one-liner, ""Nothing like fresh powder.""Don't go into this thinking to see some great acting or a deep storyline, take it for what it is; a summer action blockbuster meant to be pure escapist joy for an hour and a half of your life.

No pretensions to high art, bad overdone special effects, bad acting, dumb dialogue, wooden characters. Bring it on! Bring on the high energy, comic book action; bring on the save the world plot; bring on the really bad  villains; bring on the ultraviolence!  The music knots the movie together with its pounding rhythms -- when the editing fails, which it often did.  I actually thought the tunes were one of the strong points of the movie, and I am no metalhead. That, and all the big explosions! The James Bond references made by others were right on the money.  This is the American Bond: crude, rude and to the point. This movie is far better than every Roger Moore Bond movie; and compares well to the Pierce Brosnan ones.  But a better comparison is the Die Hard series. Pure action and thrills.  Check your brain at the door, and enjoy a wild, testosterone-driven thrill ride, because XXX delivers.",xXx

The film is made all the better on a personal level in the fact that Rammstein make a live appearance at the beginning of the film. Vin Diesel has the charisma and potential to be the next big action movie star and has a really cool voice. Samuel Jackson gets to play his typical gruff shouting role that he has made his own and there are several stunts that are truly breathtaking, it is just sad that one of these led to the stuntman performing it's death.",xXx

Bye bye little mouse!"" (waving his hand 'bye bye')2 - As Diesel is about to be killed by the Czech cop-turned-traitor, the cop is shot through the wooden door by Argento's character (who obviously couldn't actually see where her bullets would go).  The best part is they actually try to explain it by having her say, ""I heard where you were in the room""3 - at the end, when Diesel is on 'Ahab' and the missiles are about to fire, the expression on his face as the camera pans up from the missiles to him. Classic.It has amused me to no end to think of the director actually directing the actors to act the way they did.  ""Now, when the camera pulls up onto you, I want you to look terrified as if you don't know what to do and you are frozen with fear!........Perfect!  Its a print!""Anyways, feel free to list your personal favorite moments.  I'd love to be reminded of why I found it so awfully amusing.",xXx

259,Fred_Paris,"Watchable, but pretty bad",5,15 April 2004,"XXX is rightfully compared to the James Bond series. It does indeed resemble the recent incarnations of the British secret agent movies except that its makers seem to have been intent on overdoing everything. This includes more bad acting, more ridiculous sets, more ugly props, more unbelievable explosions. Oh and whoever thought of a ""solar powered submarine"" ought to be shot (although the ""submarine"" ends up navigating on the surface all the time so I expect it's not that big an issue after all). The only strange exception was that the female lead didn't have a breast implant for some strange reason. Maybe all the budget was spent buying gasoline for the explosions.Some lines of the dialog are relatively funny in a 2nd degree kind of way buy most fall flat, thanks to Vin Diesel's remarkably flat acting (and to the lines themselves not being all that great to begin with).So what you'll get is people driving cars amidst fuel explosions while firing guns (poorly, as usual) and delivering poor one liners. It is entirely possible to spend two hours that way on a rainy night and even remotely enjoy it but if you want a good action movie or one with clever dialogs or even decent acting, this definitely isn't it.",xXx

I think a 12 year old directed it to. So if you're 12 years old, you might enjoy this film. XXX is so bad, you might need to provide your own jokes and dialogue Mystery Science Theatre style to help ease the pain of watching this.Now I know you can't take a movie like this too seriously, but come on. They didn't even try with this one. There's a heat-seeking missle that that singles out one guy in a room full of people because he's smoking...and let's not forget the lead female who has the amazing ability to shoot one guy through closed doors and avoiding hitting another. How did she do that? Well, she explains: ""I heard you talking so I knew where you were standing"" (Apparently she uses this same magical ability later in the movie to see straight through a bridge wall to find the hero.) XXX is full of really bad moments like these.Some of the stunts are pretty cool though. However, some go too far. So far that they stop being cool and become absurd.Sometimes I like to be entertained by a mindless action movie, but this one is so mindless that I think that I am now less intelligent having seen it.",xXx
261,spearsdw,Like a D-grade comic book brought to life.,4,28 August 2002,"***POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD***This is a REALLY bad film.  The main culprits:  the screenplay and Vin Diesel's acting, both of which are god-awful.  This super-schlocky superspy movie has as it's main bad guy a Czech anarchist who perfectly represents the cinema's current East Bloc baddie stereotype; it must be written in some fabled ""Screenwriter's Code"" somewhere: ""All post-Cold War Eastern European villains will have long, greasy hair and five o'clock shadow and will sneer a lot.""  Anyway, he's intent on A DEVIOUS PLAN WHICH WILL PLUNGE THE WORLD INTO ANARCHY!  Yes, folks, this is the ""new breed"" of spy movie; aren't you excited?  Vin, of course, plays the hero:  Xander Cage, an extreme-sports punk who keeps getting in trouble with the law (but kids, his heart is in the right place, god love him!).  Samuel L. Jackson is the NSA bureaucrat who comes up with the only-in-movieland caprice of recruiting Cage to infiltrate and take down the above-mentioned villain's organization.As I mentioned earlier, Diesel does not distinguish himself in this, uh, ""project.""  The only other things I've seen him in are ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Pitch Black"", in both of which I thought he was good.  But, geez, with ""XXX"", it's like he's suddenly been struck clueless.  I guess he was too busy; he was also an executive producer (which means he was one of those PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE for this drivel) so he probably couldn't be bothered with mundane matters like delivering dialogue with emotion or establishing character.There are some good things in this movie.  Asia Argento (Dario Argento's daughter, for all you horror fans out there) does a great job as the Love Interest Who Is Forced To Keep Switching Allegiances.  She's tough and sexy but vulnerable too.  Also, there's fantastic footage of the beautiful city of Prague (where most of the film takes place).  And there's a terrifically weird, eye-popping animation sequence over the closing credits.You know, in retrospect, it's kind of lame when the end credits are among the most enjoyable parts of a movie.I see where IMDb already has a listing for ""XXX 2.""""The horror...the horror.""",xXx

All in all I thought the film was poor but a great laugh to watch because everything was so far fetched and made no sense at all.

Incredible laughs!What? Vin Diesel is not a good actor? Well what do you need to be a good actor? You have to create feelings to the ones watching you.

How can you people think that a three-hour movie with a ""frog rain"" climax can be interesting?

First of all: Vin Diesel must be the worst actor in history, he is worse than Hayden Christensen and Pamela Aderson. Instead of reading his lines he communicates them in a kind of caveman-fashion... secondly he also grunts the rest of his lines.Then there is the worst action scene in history of film-making.Vin Diesel is to escape a castle full of bad guys: Vin Diesel have placed C4-explosives around the castle, then he steals a bike, and rides to the gate, then but 5 bad-guys springs out - Vin Diesel shoot these people with ease, then he rides at full speed at the gate (which must be around 15 meters high), then somehow Vin Diesel manages to jump his motorcycle up in the air, then about 25 bad guys shows up on both sides of the gate, Vin Diesel being the tough guy which he is, jumps back on the seat of his motorcycle, graps around the back of the bike, then pulls out a machine-gun (all this is in a lame slow-motion), then Vin Diesel manages to shoot every single bad guy between the eye in a cool fashion, then he shoots all the badguys on the other site, lands in a cool fashion, and pulls a detonator and uses it to blow up most of the castle....... all this in what in the reel world would have been 15 seconds...... i have never seen a scene in a movie which i have hated more....it speaks for the whole movie.

Here's the thing though.  Two things actually, number one: it's intended as pure escapism, nothing more, nothing less, and on that it succeeds.  Number two: it's James Bond.  Bond is also ridiculous escapism, full of mediocre acting, gratuitous sex and violence, and an explosion every scene.  Xander Cage is an american James Bond.  I know, James Bond is sophisticated and stylish, but that's why I say Cage is an AMERICAN James Bond...british are sophisticated and stylish.  Americans are brash, loud, and crude.  James Bond represents the british stereotype, Xander Cage represents the american stereotype.  How can there be any doubt of this, when one of the most famous Bond scenes (Bond parachuting with a british flag parachute) is almost identically recreated in XXX with Xander Cage parasailing with an american flag parachute?  The story could be substituted with James bond at any point and it would be exactly the same. You can't judge a movie like this on the merits of ""high art""...the criteria for its success is really a criterion: is it fun?  Yes...yes it is.  It's pointless, ridiculous, and absolutely sensationalistic, but it's fun.  Based on the merits of its criterion, it achieves its goal perfectly. 10/10",xXx

I mean heres Xander who is recruited by a secretive organization to save the world. Then there is Yorgi who is the evil boss of this one, determined on reaching a specific goal, no matter what it takes. The acting is good, but not particularly of note; mostly I went to see this film because of the extreme sports involved and because I wanted to see a good action flick.So to finish off, I believe that XXX was created so (and I'm not trying to nationalize here or anything) that America would have there own secret agent.

This is a true callback to the action epics of the 80s, complete with a lead actor that is obviously enjoying himself and what he does.  Diesel isn't a great actor, but he's really good in these roles and that's all that matters.This isn't a high drama that should make you think, so I don't see why people are complaining that it didn't make them think.  It's obviously a high energy action film, and it did it flawlessly.  It also harkened back to the days of 007 doing outrageous stunts and measured up with ease.Does XXX replace Bond?  No, but they can very easily co-exist as they don't really merit comparison, other than they are both spies.Is it a stupid film?  Only if you expected something more than a big action movie, which is what all the promotional materials said it was.

This has got to be one of the most appalling, pointless, moronic, tedious films ever made - it is a triumph of bad film-making. The performances from Diesel, Jackson and everyone else in the film are at a level more often seen in nativity plays, ably assisted by a script resembling an episode of The A-Team but with less emotion and less philosophical depth. I have never been a great fan of James Bond movies, but I suddenly felt a warm, intense longing for Connery, Moore et al after seeing this absolute car-crash of a film. Beyond the extraordinary incompetence of the direction (from a director clearly unable to understand the use and necessity of geography in any scene, let alone the concepts of atmosphere, tension etc), the poor, out-of-date special effects, over-bearing, nasty score, and desperately awful acting, this was so enormously old-fashioned as to be insulting.

Other than dealing out a healthy slice of Vin Diesel justice the film offers little more. The direction is to say the least excrement; a soundtrack that would get even Stephen Hawking running in terror; acting as usual for Vin is top notch, raising the bar for the likes of Kevin Spacey and Anthony Hopkins. If you didn't enter with epilepsy you're sure as hell going to leave with it; as the senses are raped by explosion after mind-numbing explosion. It's true what they say; sawing your own leg off with a stone is both less painful and more entertaining. The plot is overly simple to the extent of it being a personal affront to the audience; how many times have we been subjected to the same 'working for the government - saving the world' combo?

If you don't mind the cheesy ""EXTREME"" generation of products and advertising that has assaulted us in the past few years and like watching things blow up then this is watchable. I never found myself wanting to turn it off although a lot of the scenes had me feeling truly embarrassed for Vin, who plays a much better Riddick than Xander Cage (I mean, come on, the lead character's name should give you a clue as to what kind of movie this is). Extremely clichéd, predictable, and obviously aimed at 13 year old boys, I still found myself watching it until the end which is more than I can say about some movies. The action sequences were great, Asia Argento was hot as usual, and there were occasional moments of coolness, but for the most part this movie falls flat on its face due to the contrived plot line, young target audience, and lack of violence that should be at least somewhat prevalent in an action movie with this kind of plot. I think 2 people were shot with actual bullets in this movie, the rest were tranquilized or gassed silently (no coughing up blood or intense scenes here folks).

I had felt a rush like that since ""JP3"",(the brilliantly edited avalanche sequence will make you get on the edge of your seat). And the production design is great you know they spent a lot on this film.What didn't work: The villain here is so stereotypical, evil Russian accent, machine that could destroy country and create world war 3, this is all to familiar.

Did the studios even test screen this movie?  If they did, did they realize that the audience was laughing at the movie and not with it.  Bottom line:  This is the worst movie I have ever seen.  Seriously.  But if you want the fun experience of going to a movie where the person sitting next to you is laughing his head off while Vin Diesel is blowing the bad guys away then go see this movie.",xXx
285,mz4392,Good Action Packed Film,8,9 March 2003,"The film has a good plot and is tangled with mystery. There are a couple of scenes that are a little far fetched but the graphics made up for any deficit, wait until you read the stunt line up and you will understand. I gave it an 8 based on the stunts and graphics, it held my interest and was entertaining. If you are an action person I would recommend owning the DVD or the VHS tape.",xXx

Amazing (impossible) stunts, lots of tatoos, big ol' guns, and... cars! It got old after a while though.  It was much too far fetched for my taste.

There were moments when I found myself either a. shocked into silence by the absurdity of the thing or b. laughing at the complete implausibility of some of the scenes or the horrendous dialogue.      Given this I will concede the fact that the action sequences were for the most part well choreographed. Some of the special effects were also great.      But unfortunately this does not make up for the poor script, wooden acting and a disappointing performance by Samuel L. Jackson. The plot was poorly developed and vital information went unexplained for far too long.     I really, really wanted to like this movie but my tolerance of stupidity can only be stretched so far.

I like the plotline and think the action and stunt scenes were excellent. I was glad that we got to know a bit about the characters, but I would've like to know about more about Samuel L. Jackson's character. I hope that they have a sequel for this movie, cuz I would go and definately see it. The soundtrack for this film was great too.",xXx

Though I am not a Rammstein fan, the energy they gave the beginning of the movie was a great way to pull the audience into the action. The stunts and driving were wonderful, as usual with Vin Diesel movies. The plot was okay. I pretty much knew that the chick was an American undercover from a little after the movie started, and she wouldn't have been my pick to end up with Xander, but whatever. The movie was still nicely executed and did not disappoint me after beginning my obsession with the actor and watching his Riddick movies.

He is soooooooo XXI° century. Tatooed, terrible fur coats, does not drink, hate the smoke, come out from jail, become friend with his enemies, shoots at the police officer to convince the ""bad"" that he is with them, has no respect for anyone...It is a sign of the times, today's heroes are ambiguous scrap, borderline and psychotic, with very few notions on how to distinct good from bad - apart his own - preferably built in some strange place, with a doubtful past.Gosh if I was 16, I know how I would like this movie for the action and the ass-kicking phases... But today, I just wonder if the ""stirred but not shaken"" old model of ""save-the-world-hero"" wasn't just better than the moraleless, cynical and despaired XXX ? Or is he just too U.S. vs. his Brit counterpart ?***SPOILER*** By the way, if you like James Bond for the scenarios and the plot, XXX is a typical Bond plot : a crazy russian and his anarchist fellow friends wants to destroy with biological weapons all the major cities of the world for some obscure political reason. They were already infiltrated by the Russian secret services, but they lack so much of initiative and funds that the American agent has to come and save the poor Czech people who don't even know they are being threatened...

But the problem is that for some unknown reason studios keep on hiring Rob Cohen to make movies, and he ruins them.  I mean, come on, XXX was terrible.  The script was god awful, worse than The Fast and The Furious.  The acting, besides Vin Diesels was terrible.  And the film looked awful.  Rob Cohen does not know how to properly compose a shot.  Everything just looked atrocious.  And the fact that people are comparing this to James Bond makes me sick.  And Bond film, even Timothy Daltons, were better than this.  It was so blatantly trying to appeal to 12 year old boys and was disgusting, always talking about playstations and skateboarding.  Enough already.  Vin Diesel tries to say that he is a secret agent kids can identify with.  Hmmmm.  Young boys identifying with a muscular 30 something year old tattoed covered man who is antisocial and drives cars off of bridges, who travels to Prague to fight a World Crime Organization, and while he's at it has lots of sex with exotic european women.  I can't think of one young boy that can identify with that.  They they just because he mentions playstations and skateboarding and he snowboards abit kids can identify with him?  James Bond was doing extreme sports long before it was cool and trendy.  James Bond kicks XXX ass any day.  XXX is a sell out. The movie stinks. XXX could have been good.

However, the reason why I could watch this movie without getting bored is not the story or the characters of the movie. The reason was the continuous action within the movie.

But, to my surprise, it wasn't that bad after all. Sure, it certainly is no masterpiece, and the plot is quite ludicrous (though it's not any worse than, say, the plot of any of the James Bond movies...), but in the end, it IS just an action flick. It aims to entertain with explosions, stunts and some hip and cool (though not very believable) characters ... and it does just that. So, if you're looking for some easy entertainment you won't need your brain for, go watch this movie. Yeah, it's a guilty pleasure, but ultimately an entertaining one. 5/10",xXx
299,sir_tal,A short comment regarding expectations in regards to movie reviews.,10,12 September 2002,"This movie was very enjoyable for what it was, which is why I rated it very highly.  Have I seen ""better movies?""  Yes.  I believe I have.  For example, in my opinion, nothing is going to touch Sean Connery as James Bond in the spy genre, though I am always open to any challenges.So what was this movie?  It was a chance for a newer generation to relate to the spy genre.  Espionage movies were very big in the James Bond heyday, but most of the younger generation just doesn't catch the whole ambiance of the James Bond movie.  (Pierce Brosnan makes a great James Bond, of course, but the actor is not the point...the character is.)  I've actually heard people ask what a martini is.  Nothing wrong with that, but XXX just sort of brought it down to a new level, and an enjoyable one...Vin Diesel really brings his charisma into this movie full-force, and makes a very believable scuzz bag.  :)  This movie is an excellent flick, and if you've not watched it yet, I highly recommend it!  (May not be suitable for younger children, but my mother-in-law enjoyed it, so it's probably pretty harmless.)  :)  -C",xXx

Or did his reputed publicity-shy attitude contribute? Because he was, along with star Vin Diesel and Asia Argento, pivotal to the success of the movie.",xXx
301,cosyCloud,loud and action packed!,8,1 September 2002,"The summary pretty much says it all. I truly enjoyed this movie for what it was. An action-packed action movie.

303,daisy@olypen.com,very average,5,15 August 2002,"This movie is very unimpressive. It wasn't terrible, The stunts were at first fun to watch, but after a while I felt they just delayed the movie.The plot was ok, and the acting was decent, I just thought that after a while the movie really seemed to drag.

304,psegrin,Absolute James Bond ripoff!!!!,1,9 August 2002,"XXX is perhaps the biggest James Bond ripoff I have ever seen. From the line ""The things I do for my country."" to the American flag parachute is a direct ripoff of 007. I'll admit the movie has some great action sequences, but I've seen nearly all of them done before in a James Bond film. The biggest ripoff has to be the car. 007's car is what made him unique and fun to watch. When someone ripsoff Bond's car, I consider it a direct insult.As for the movie itself; it had a nice concrete storyline with action sequences. If you're into watching a lot of stunts being preformed on screen, the I suggest you see this movie. One thing that bothered me in the movie was Vin's fur coat. That thing looked god awful. Bad choice on the costume design's part. My final verdict is; if you like gripping ""edge of your seat"" action, then go see this movie. If you don't (which I strongly recommend) then you really aren't missing anything special.",xXx
305,lbrunson,Move Over James Bond? No!,6,27 August 2002,"I saw this movie a few days ago.  Now, the buzz in the entertainment world has been that this movie is action packed and sends James Bond to the old folks home.  While it is action packed--there is no doubt about that--it just wasn't as good as it was hyped up to be.  I can't exactly put my finger on it, but XXX is missing something.  Maybe it was the fact that Xander Cage seemed to be invincible, (SPOILER...maybe) I mean the bad guys never seemed to get the upper hand on him. All in all, I think a few little improvements here and there would have improved the movie, but it is still definitely worth seeing.",xXx
306,noonie-1,"B movie action flick, had some good shots but most bad.",2,30 August 2002,"This is a B movie action flick. If you like to see stuff blow up go see it. Leave during the avalanche scene (it has some bad edits, or maybe it was a broken film at the theater), stay and be disappointed by the ending (nothing blows up).The beginning is the best and it slowly degrades from there. Perhaps the script writer and editor got tired and stopped trying towards the end of the movie. This movie has some really great scenes, concepts and action sequences. Too bad it couldn't have ended with a better action sequence. The boat vs car chase at the end was simply disappointing. Lame chase scene at about 25 miles per hour (no matter how much you move the camera the vehicles don't really look like they go faster).  Some cool graphics during the end credits though.Some of the explosions looked real, some were obviously computer generated.This might make a good 30 minute show if the bad parts were edited out.",xXx

As it is, the movie falls flat as soon as xXx (Vin Diesel) opens his mouth. Apart from this, the story and special effects are good, actually even pointing your mind towards Bond, though not as gentlemanlike an approach. If you are a fan of special effects and can see past V.D:s lack of acting talents, (hard but it can be done), you will probably enjoy this movie. If you need quality acting for your pleasure, then go see something else!",xXx

Sure it isn't the most thought-provoking of films, but it doesn't set out to be.It is an action flick, and does exactly what it says on the tin. I was entertained, and even impressed by the special effects.
Dialogue and plot not so good. Even the subtitled dialogue was dire: ""Catch him quick, kill him slow"" Yuck.But For a pop-corn movie it did the job.",xXx
309,tswindude1221,Are you serious????????,2,13 October 2003,"When I decided to rent this movie, I had heard all my friends saying this was the greatest movie. They loved it. I could usually trust them in their opinions, but their opinions were way off.We all probably agree: 2 Fast 2 Furious was a total improvement on the The Fast and The Furious. Why? The best guess I can give is because Vin decided to leave. He's a total publicity stunt. A money-maker. And we fall into the trap. Vin, if you're reading this, take my advice: you can't act, so go back to being a bouncer. At the very least, you would make a publicity stunt working as that.The biggest problem with XXX is Vin can't act. He's in every scene, and this is what shines through. I don't know how they can't Samuel Jackson to actually work with him. Even if Vin could act, it's no savior to a script that lags in every single thing they do. How could that be possible in an action movie of that caliber? Simple: through the whole movie, you ask yourself, Is that possible? Given this kind of action movie, it really should try to keep some level of reality to it, but it seems Vin's motto happens to be is, ""As long as it makes money."" Even the special effects are horrible. The avalanche makes you look at the clock, the chase at the end of the movie makes you wonder how long the movie is (and there's only five minutes left in the movie!), and the motorcycle chase scene made me think of other things I could be doing.The worst part of the movie (this is quite a feat, actually, they should be given an award) is Jackson's lines are more predictable than Vin's. How in the world could that be possible????In the sequel coming out in two years, Ice Cube is taking over Vin's part. I actually think Vin did the project a favor by quitting for a second time in a row.To make a horribly long story short: a very generous * out of ****",xXx

However, I recommend it for action fans.The main part of the story is poor, but it haves some incredeble moments, that really saves this movie. And by showing cool technology, It even shows some unnecessary scenes. Voice acting is OK. But, they really know how to do the Russian accent.

Enter Vin Diesl as a macho extreme sports guy that is destined as the new breed of agent. After 2 days of ""training"" he is sent out to catch the bad guys. In order to make a good secret agent movie you need a great bad guy. The Russian ex-military, now anarchist is very stereotypical and pretty uninteresting. Even his Evil Plan (TM) was uninteresting.Overall a uninspired, boring movie even if it has a ton of explosions. Vin Diesl displays the acting skills of a garden gnome, and i kept hoping James Bond would show up in his tux to kick his ass. Even the worst James Bond movies is a lot better than this.",xXx

The film in my opinion is actually well done, has a good story, plot line, decent acting, and plenty of action to keep you entertained. No. It will never win an Oscar, but then actions movies rarely do. But for an action movie...there are a lot worse out there and xXx is one of the best. But the ending leaves you feeling like you have just found out that the winning number of 36 on the lottery ticket which has just won you the Jackpot, is actually a 38, and you actually just won a single note. I thought my TV had just tuned in to an episode of Sting Ray or Thunderbirds meets James Bond 1980. Awful. And whilst most action films are largely based on lies (ie: man stands in front 10 people shooting at him with automatic machine guns and lives to tell the tale), this ending makes you sit up and think ""give me a break !!""

I didn't expect much, just an enjoyable action movie with my new favorite star, Vin Diesel. And still the movie has managed to disappoint me. The action is there all right, and the cinematography was excellent. BUT, a movie requires a basic interesting plot and reasonable dialogs, not to mention good acting. All these were missing !!! I thought Vin Diesel chose right not to make a sequel to THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS, since it was a pretty stupid movie. But now I have to question his artistic motives, because he comes out quite pathetic in XXX (and to think they are planning a series ...)If you'll leave your brain outside the theater and forget that Vin Diesel ever played Riddick, then you might enjoy this one.",xXx

But unless you are the target audience for this movie (13 year old males) this is not the movie to see.  The dark, vulgar undertones of this movie traumatized my nervous system almost as much as the loud continuous noise and explosions that did not cease from film beginning to film end.  The special effects attempted to be breathtaking, but the CGI in this film was poor at best.  Many times I found myself shaking my head as Vin Diesel rushed into danger in a clearly fake CGI world.  Then there is the acting and script.  What acting and script?  I truly think that they were making this up as they went along.  Have we really sunk this low that we are expected to be entertained with noise, explosions, and special effects without the benefit of meaningful acting and scripting.  I feel insulted.  The only redeeming factor of this movie (and I mean the only redeeming factor) was Samuel L. Jackson's performance.  But this was not enough to salvage this poor excuse for a movie.

But the movie itself sucks a lot. It tries to be a James Bond with a bad ass flavor but actually fails miserably. Some of the action scenes are actually quite well scripted and I would'nt be surprised if others found them to be excellent but the way they've been executed makes them plain boring and one could even fall asleep. The story is the standard bad guy wants to destroy xyz place using nuke/bio/chem weapons. The villains come across as idiots and Vin Diesel sucks in his role.",xXx

A guy that the girls like that is too cool for me to even begin to be jealous about. His character here and the situations he is put in are so unbelievable that the only way I could accept it was to think that this was like a super-charged comic book. After I made that decision, this movie was a blast. Just like with FAST & THE FURIOUS, I left the theatre filled with adrenaline, wanting to try all the stunts and start racing a motorbike. Despite how over-the-top the stunt sequences are in the film they are presented well enough that I can't help but cheer in the theatre. That's what this movie is: a chance for you to say, ""Oh s**t!"" as many times as you want amongst 500 people. In my opinion, XXX blows 007 out of the water.

Besides the story is easy going and enjoyable if you just accept it for what it is.I don't like to compare movies across genres, so I always rate movies compared to others in their own genre and xXx is borderline 10 in the action genre, but I have to give it a 9.

326,darth struction,Don't believe the critics. 'xXx' does it better than Bond.,9,10 August 2002,"""xXx"" is dumb and unbelievable.  So what! This is a ACTION SPY MOVIE, based on the time-tested and time-worn 007 template, with a few upgrades for the new millenium.  If you're expecting realism, that's your problem.  I've been a fan of the Bond movie franchise but it's been dated and stale since the seventies. (Although Timothy Dalton was quite a good actor, overqualified for Bond films, actually.)  ""xXx"" is a guilty pleasure that is as much of this millenium as Bond was to the sixties. It is also a paradox, the slavish copy that is sharper and fresher than the original.The acting by the Diesel, Asia Argento, Marton Csokas and Samuel L. is surprisingly good, much better than you'd expect from any action flick. Diesel plays Xander Cage seriously but with healthy doses of humour.  His character does daring and courageous feats, but is also capable of feeling fear and vulnerability.  Diesel's innate intelligence is clearly apparent, showing once and for all, that he's much more than a lumbering musclehead. You'd be hard-pressed to find performances this good in any Bond movie.The plot of the movie really is dumb and unbelievable, but with a few twists that actually work.  The characters are written as smartly as possible under the circumstances.  They are given motivations that are at least halfway believable.  All through the movie, Xander Cage is a fun fantasy figure who also manages to be more identifiable and likeable than the snooty upper-class 007 ever was. Bond is cruel but gets the job done.  Cage is a more complex character who starts out as an anti-authoritarian rogue but develops ideals and feelings for those around him and also gets the job done.Another upgrade over Bond is the stuntwork.  With only one or two exceptions, the stunt-doubling is near flawless.  Most of the time, it's easy to imagine that Vin Diesel is doing the extreme stuntwork.Add it all up and the proof is there, xXx  007.  Not only is ""xXx"" not as bad as most critics would have you believe, but if you suspend your disbelief and keep your expectations in check, you can almost imagine that it's one of the best movies of 2002.",xXx
327,MrBlack74,IF only he could play cards...,1,17 August 2002,"OH please anyone who attempts at seeing greatness in this film is looking far too deep into the shallow inch of film-making which, is XXX.First the film could not have ripped off of James Bond more blantantly, namely THe SPy WHo Loved me. From the car, to the rival spy is nearly a spot on match to the above film. Second the film is unbelievable, now of course that's the basis of almost all action films but this one especially so, outracing an avalanche, c'mon. Lastly they ripped off of the glorious Dr. Strangelove, with the whole AHab riding at the end. 1/10,  i reccomend no other films",xXx

Vin Diesel may well be the next big thing in leading men of action, but this sure wasn't the vehicle.",xXx
330,genocidal,Great Entertainment,10,10 August 2002,"Lots of action, explosions, extreme stunts and chicks. This film had everything you could want in a movie, it even had a reasonable plot.

Submarine?,4,11 August 2002,"I only got one problem with XXX, besides the script, bad acting, and bad directing...(spoiler alert)What is up with the submarine?Other than that it is almost a tolerable action movie.

332,Mr-KISS,Who Cares,7,5 June 2003,"It was good fun and cool to look at. XXX is no 'Memento' or 'Citizen Kane' nor is it a 'Bond film'. Don't expect it to be a life changing experience or a cult classic. But anyone who expected something more, either hadn't seen the trailer's or don't understand the ""Trailer - Movie"" relationship. XXX was a faced paced, revved up action movie, it was a longer version of it's trailer. (It was also as intelligent and story based as its trailer) But what else would it be.Young males and action fans will like it. I don't think it was aiming for the Oscar or the AFI top 100 (not they mean much). In short if you don't like switching your brains off for 90 minutes and enjoying mindless action, don't waste your money at the cinema's and then complain about it on the internet. Otherwise line up and enjoy it like I did.",xXx

It is cartoonish, lurching from one action sequence to another, with long boring bits inbetween. The writers obviously didn't spend much time thinking up a plot, and even the special effects and stunts are over-hyped. I couldn't wait for it to end.The only thing that was good about XXX is that it showed how out of touch movie the movie critics who claimed that ""Xander Cage is the next generation's James Bond"" really are.

I believe they could have stretched that out another 15-20 minutes and gave us a few more action shots as well as one last humorous situation.  But, overall I gave it a 9.",xXx

OK, I admit, it is no intellectual movie, nothing You have to think of, but I do not expect something like this when I go to see an action movie. My bottom line is that Triple X is a very well done action movie, the dialogues may not be very bright, the plot not very realistic, but the actors and the stunts are great. Xander Cage, played by Vin Diesel, is bad and rebellious, nevertheless he deserves the comparison to James Bond. He is funny and he is not stupid. He has charm and he knows how to react in dangerous situations. To sum it up, Triple X is a great action movie, with interesting and good actors, and it is definitely worth a look.",xXx

I can only say... WHAT THE %&@# ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT. 1: xXx is not suave, 2: xXx does not have super high tech gadgetry, 3: xXx only comes close to comparing to the stunts of 007.Vin Diesel's character Xander Cage is not trained to be a secret agent, he's not meant to look at a situation and figure all the angles and beat the bad guy. he has other people doing the thinking for him. plus there are several times in the movie where his inexperience with such tools as firearms shows. Cage is a guy that looks at movies and says ""I could do that"". thats what made him an extreme athlete. he doesn't get the hang of actually killing people for a while. he finds his skills from copying what he sees in movies and does in video games.one of my favorite parts of the movie is when Diesel says to a cop,""you got a bazooka, dude stop thinking Prague police and start thinking Playstation, BLOW $#!% UP""! this one line shows that he is immature and inexperienced. hes always just along the lines of reality and video games, as that is a big part of todays culture.His inexperience as a secret agent is the second main highlight of this film, he is just an extreme sports punk. nothing more nothing less.",xXx

Conceived by Rich Wilkes (""The Stoned Age"") as a revamp of the James Bond legend, Cohen's film is a vacuum of time, talent, and money.I am having trouble coming up with a concise, clever way of maligning this film, simply because there is so little right with it. Even the near-100 million dollar production and its effects look cheap. The film is a concoction of buzz words and fads led by rising star who somehow manages to be out-classed by Arnold Schwarzengger.1/10",xXx
343,jen-dave,I was dumber for having watched this film,1,7 August 2005,"The closest thing to film-making in this movie was the repeated flashes to the xXx tattoo. Nice editing and timing in those shots. However, I GOT IT after the first sixteen times! The action scenes were mildly thrilling, and if that's the only reason you go to see a movie, knock yourself out with this one. However if you're looking for plot or character development, you'd really be better off knocking yourself out with a large blunt object than seeing this joke of a flick. It didn't earn the dubious distinction of being the first movie I ever didn't watch until the end---I had enough time invested that I couldn't see not finishing it. However, in retrospect, my time would have been better sent watching paint dry---It would have given me more insight into humanity.",xXx

348,moviemayker,Another cheesy action movie,2,11 August 2002,It amazes me that scripts like this get the green light. This movie was just pure cheesy action. It made me curious how Vin Diesel is riding around on a motorcycle in the middle of a cocaine plantation going off of invisible jumps while shooting down thugs in mid air and being chased by helicopters that are 20 feet behind him shooting machine guns at him but they still manage to miss while he jumps (on his motorcycle) through a 30 foot barbed wire fence without a scratch.

349,PIMPX78,Xcellent Xciting Xtrodinary Film Journey!,10,20 August 2002,"Already a huge fan of Vin Diesel I was biased going into the theater, however, this movie was nothing short of brilliant. It was action packed from start to finish. Vin plays a rebel named Xander. He is sexy and easily lovable at the same time. His style and attitude exude sex appeal and danger. He is summoned by Samuel L. Jacksons character to find out information from an Xtremely dangerous group located in Prague. He uses his street smarts and brilliant physical strength to essentially save the world. It is the inbetween that will have you gripping your seat, chuckling and clutching your heart. His stunts are amazing and as an extra bonus the soundtrack is phenomenal. You will not be disappointed with this film. The gals will love seeing Vin performing dangerous, heart stopping stunts but they will love the fact that underneath his tattoo's and rough exterior is a soft hearted man that wants to do the right thing. The fellas will enjoy the stunts, fast cars, sexy women and neat gadgets that all come along with this movie. XXX is it. The movie of the year with the actor of the year! Vin should be beaming with pride over this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!",xXx

I work in a law firm and would be considered by most very conservative.  However I am a realist and we all know this is make believe so go see this movie with that intention.  Too many people are overanalyzing the movie and expecting ""a beautiful mind"" NO PEOPLE IT""S A ""RELEASE MOVIE""  Go sit back and let the kid in you OUT TO PLAY AND DREAM AGAIN.  People talk about the stunts being over the top well my only suggestion is to sit down and watch the X-Games when they come on. All of the stunts on the moto-bike are well within reason (if you have watched X-Games you would see they didn't go as extreme as they could have) Now yes the avalanche scene is a bit .... okay impossible, but remember IT""S A RELEASE MOVIE go with it laugh, cringe, shout whatever just enjoy yourself, Trust me the realization of bills, real terrorism, a failing economy and whatever else is going on will be around to keep you grounded once the movie is over.

I dont want to give away the movie to the unlucky people who have not seen this movie yet but it is basically a lot like a new age 007 movie. Xander ""xXx"" Cage (Vin Diesel) play the leading role.

After jumping a Vette off a bring and parachuting into the river below he returns to his hideout where the police raid the party and use a tranquilizer on xXx who says ""It was only a Corvette"" before the tranquilizer finally kicks in.

Prague is visually a great city for movies, and like San Francisco seems to insist on being a character as opposed to a backdrop. If James Bond were being created today he would be a lot like Xander Cage. The opening scene shows a tuxedoed spy getting killed trying to infiltrate the baddies. Point made. True, the Bond films have kept up with the toys, but the vibe of them is still early sixties. Pierce Brosnan was nine years old when Dr. No was released. Rob Cohen seemed to be going for a Kubrick-like visual poetry thing. He didn't match the master, but I sensed shades of A Clockwork Orange in the nihilistic party ethos of Anarchy 99. Not a movie that will win an Oscar, but a lot of fun. I left the theater entertained.",xXx

For example when the ""hero"" is about to shoot the ""bad guy"", a huge ""door"" is heading for him, and with just about 20 cm left (between the ""door"" and the ""hero"", he is about to get crushed!), he starts shooting, and when finished, the door is 30 cm (!) above him... still closing in... hm, I mean, come on! This movie actually SUCK, I'm sorry about my choice of words, but hey, it really does!I can say that this movie is entertaining from time to time, and maybe it's worth renting in a couple of years, if you like american unrealistic dream-action movies!

However it isn't all that bad. It's a movie that has it's flaws (many do) and to tell the truth I don't really care. If you go into this movie expecting a basic action film than you won't be disappointed but don't go in expecting a masterpiece. This is an OK film and if you relax with it it is an enjoyable experience. The one thing that did strike me as odd is the first kissing scene between Vin Diesel and yalana.

The plot is silly, but hey this is a spy movie, most are.  There are some great one liners, and it is turning out to be a good movie.....then it happened.  I actually went back to see the movie again to find out exactly where it all fell apart.  After you hear the line ""These guys are cool, but they ain't that cool"" leave, just stop watching, you have to trust me on this one. At that point the movie takes a serious nose dive, the acting goes to hell, the plot gets stupider, and the characters become crap.  Oh yeah, then there is skate boarding with SILVER WARE.

While some of the scenarios we're over the top, they're no worse than some of the stuff Bond pulled in his movies. On that count, they're parallel.

The movie had very nice action sequences, most often labeled as extreme sports. But I have seen all of them in one or another Bond movie - some in movies made 20 years earlier. And for the photography of skiing scenes - there definitely is no better way to do these than to put Willy Bogner backwards on skis! The movie had all to much resemblance to key elements of the Bond movie ""The spy who loved me"" - even the other leading character beside Bond was named Triple X (XXX). The beginning of the movie suggests that the character played by Vin Diesel would make a better spy than a James Bond character, mainly because it fits better in a ""Rammstein"" environment. If all the difference is exchanging a tuxedo with lots of tattoos and a rather selfish attitude, I rather prefer the British gentleman with a forty year career! In comparison to the twentieth (official) Bond movie ""Die another day"" I must say that I liked Miranda Frost a lot better than this girl in XXX. And of course the Bond story again was very much larger than life, while XXX always tried to remain somewhat believable. So in the end XXX might be an nice action movie, but it is definitely no competition to James Bond!",xXx

The dialogue is idiotic and jam packed with cliché's.What made me run screaming the first time I watched it was a scene between Triple X and his love interest.  When she askes him if he remebered what she said when they kissed...  and answers ""I lied""...  COME ON!!!  We are we continuously exposed to these boring movies.

Vin Deisel is a decent actor, and anyone can tell you that he sucks at acting, but compare him to Arnold Swartzenneger, who in all his films, have punchlines, and either does a stupid smile or has a stone face.Second, Anarkey99 is actually a pretty realistic attempt to show what Exessive Anarkism stands for, with a badass villain.Third, It breaks the bond clichés WHILE having a bond plot, which actually works! fourth, the stunts are all pretty much real.This film is one of my favorites, its not Shakespeare, but its pretty damn good. The people who review it don't have an open enough mind and try to think OUTSIDE the box.",xXx
371,FMiso,Oh god Lundgren with a way bigger budget! what a waste of time and money!,1,23 February 2005,"oh my god is this a crappy movie!!!! Who could possibly like this smeg??!?? Oh!! now he eliminates a whole drug-smugglers camp with a motorcycle, now he jumps from a plane, blah, blah..boom..boom..blah..blah..boom..boom No seriously this is not a movie it's more of an endlessly long universal- studios-stunt-show-rip-off. Vin Diesel is the worst actor i've ever seen, and whats up with Samuel L. Jackson? he must have been drunk as he accepted to be a part of this. shame on you man! Sorry and whats with all the sucky macho-action-attitude stuff?? don't get me wrong i like a good Arnie flick once in a while. so don't think i don't get the point that xXx is meant to be a cool brainless action-flick. The fact is that Diesel (unlike Arnie, Snipes, Stallone or Willis) even fails to deliver that kind of cool action-hero attitude and humor one finds in all those classic brainless action-flicks like True Lies, the Die Hard series or the Escape from.. films. Worst of all this film isn't entertaining at all. you'll just sit there and watch one stupid stunt, one brainless uncool line of dialog after another and pray it's over soon. I didn't get that far though, i had to turn the DVD-player off after 30 minutes because i could'nt stand the stupidity of this movie. In my opinion don't even think of watching this crap even if you love action movies.",xXx

I enjoyed watching this movie and I liked the main character (Vin Diesel) There should be more movies like this! I saw Alone in the dark, and you could say : ""thats how the movies shouldn't be"", but about xXx you could say : ""now thats a good action movie"". :)It had very good screenplay, I think that Rob Cohen is a good director. Maybe the movie did seem unrealistic, but it sure was good fun. Of course the movie wasn't rated very good, because its like ""just"" another action movie, but movies like this are made for fun, and people are supposed to enjoy them. Because to tell the truth. Lord of the Rings was pretty boring, I better watch movies like this than Lord of the ring. Very good movie xXx. I don't think that the second part will stand close to this, first because it doesn't have Vin Diesel. and usually sequels are not as good.",xXx

There is no middle ground. xXx is one that I have a deep dislike for. Vin Diesel fits many parts but a James Bond-ish character is not one of them. It's not that his acting is subpar, but it just doesn't work. Add to this the fact that the movie is composed entirely of clichés and recycled, ridiculous action sequences, and it's all downhill. I actually squirmed when viewing the movie, I was that anxious for it to end. If you want to see Vin Diesel at his best, go see The Chronicles of Riddick, Pitch Black, or A Man Apart. xXx = formulaic, like The Pacifier.",xXx

I love the stunts and fast moving scenes and of course the whole love story really made the movie more interesting. It had great suspense and good lines. I think that Vin Diesel was the perfect man for the role. He always does good in movies where he is the bad/good guy with the tough attitude, and his voice really fits the role and makes it sound even better. Also Samuel L. Jackson did really well in his role as the agent he added suspicion and anticipation to the movie. I just really thought that this movie was really good and I hope that more are coming out like it!!!",xXx
375,ambrunt,xXx my kind of film,8,17 August 2006,"Being a Vin Diesel fan this film was a must see for me. After seeing ""Pitch Black"" and ""The Fast and the Furious"" I like his calm and cool with a hint of casual violence thrown in for good measure. He has the ability to carry the roles he plays with absolute confidence in himself without appearing over confident or false which would be easy to do in such roles as these. OK the film is full of hi-tec impossible gadgets and more extreme sports stunts than a stunt-man convention. But the gadgets fade into the background as the stunts and very credible acting talents of Vin Diesel and Samuel L Jackson as the good guys supported by Michael Roof as the Tech-Head (the one supplying the previously mentioned gadgets) and Marton Csokas and Asia Argento as the baddies make the easy to follow plot whip along at break-neck speed. Vin Diesel plays the extreme sports expert and adrenaline junkie Xander Cage press-ganged into working for Samuel L Jackson (Agent Augustus Gibbons) to uncover a gang of ex-special forces soldiers of Russian Decent hell bent on plunging the world into anarchy and that is all there is to it really, but throw it to the mixing pot the very well done introduction of Xander base jumping from a car being driven off a bridge and the imaginative tests for the induction into Gibbons agency, add a dash of excellent metal music then bring to the boil with lots of motorcycle stunts snowboarding and a sprinkle of the normal explosions in slow motion and you get an easy to watch entertaining action film. No it is not the world's best action film, no it is not the cleverest plot, no there are no massive twists and yes there are some corny gags and a few predictable outcomes. All in all a beer and nuts film that you can watch over and over because there are always little bits of stunts that you have missed or a corny line that makes you smile. So it doesn't bother me that others don't like this film, it has two of my top ten favourite actors (Diesel and Jackson) and it is amongst my collection of DVDs, so it gets an 8/10 from me just because it does what it says on the tin.",xXx

377,laconicy,A good diversion to get your heart racing,7,9 August 2002,"You probably won't leave 'XXX' thinking of future Oscar nominations, but you will leave feeling alive and wanting to go out to do something exciting.In his role as Xander, Vin Diesel comes across as a honest individual with an edge, but it's comforting to see he isn't uber-flashy or trying to overact in this leading role. After viewing 'XXX' I wouldn't mind seeing Vin in another leading role in another movie, even a sequel.The editing, or maybe the stuntwork, was superb. There weren't any jarring changes in camera angles to smooth out seemingly impossible action sequences that ignored the laws of physics. The film kept the viewer at high alert with every action shot, pushing the realm of the believable with each passing moment.The high-intensity pace was also a drawback. There were action segments that were drawn out too far. The viewer became numb to the steadily rising crescendo of death-defying and superhuman acts Xander was capable of. And, if you're in a theater with superb sound support, your ears will begin to bleed after just so much gunfire, engine squelches, explosions, and staccato techno beat.Some of the writing was quite clever, resulting in enough zingers from Xander to get even jaded movie audiences to chuckle and begin to identify with him.Samuel L. Jackson was an added bonus, though his stony exterior and odd sense of humor made it seem as if he was reliving his role in 'Unbreakable.''XXX' is a pretty good movie. It's not high-drama, doesn't tell much of a story, and won't make you think. But it will give some thrills and is one of those movies you should see on the big screen for the best effect.",xXx

When are directors going to learn that this is such an over used cliche and try something different (""Russia saves the day"" maybe).The plot: A Russian army breakaway group called Anarchy-99 are planning to destroy 10 major cities and hope that all the countries of the world start blaming each other.

With obedient Czech's, commanding and superior Americans, and Russians who simply cannot understand where their place is. After they are beaten in Cold War, assh*les think that they can oppose us in the mafia-style stuff. O no, this will not work!It makes man really ask himself, how scriptwriters of this kind of sh*t are not ashamed, to write such cloned deeds. And, because that's major difference between them and me, is superfluous to talk about anything else.Crap in terms of character motivation, storyline, and in (especially) at least believable trail of realism. Same bullshit, as movies Bad Company or Chasing Liberty. Doesn't matter that those movies are different in genre  state policy of US is clearly depicted in both, and meant to infiltrate in sub conscience of young Americans. Same is here. That is sole purpose of XxX. (Aside of earning money).Nor Europe, nor Russians are like this. Sooner people who enjoy this kind of movies realize that, return of the Cold War will not be so soon. That is kind of low-brain ideology, which is tolerable in food industry-poetics as Too fast, too furious is.

He then answers with a typical film guru's answer and she tells him no, not that kind of movie. What film do you like even though you know it is bad. What film do you find yourself watching when no other film will do. She tells Dawson hers is Hardball. She then goes on to explain how she can't help but feel for the kids of a rough neighborhood and that she gets choked up at the end. Anyway, XXX is that film for me.

Reality television has no real value, but in some cases it can be quite entertaining to watch. The same, in theory, holds true to most action films. While some are able to expand beyond the limiting shell of the genre, most, even some of the better, fall pray to it.And here is xXx, a starring vehicle for barritone voiced Vin Diesel, and an attempt at a movie franchise for years to come. Do they have their franchise? Probably. Is it entertaining? Yes. Is it really that good? No.The plot of the movie revolves around Xander Cage (Diesel)0, a rogue extreeme sports athlete who is eventually 'recruited' by Samuel L Jackson, in secret government agent mode, to serve his country. This doesn't sit well with Cage, but he agree's. This brings him into the fold of your typical Russian anarchists bent on destroying the world, complete with a romance interest for Diesel.xXx has some high quality stunt sequences, granted, at least one of them doesn't really make sense as to the reasoning for it, but heck, why ask questions?Vin Diesel has movie star quality to him. Even some corny lines can't hold him back. Diesel has what most other action stars lack: actual acting skill. In the right roles, Diesel can really shine.If you're looking for a fun way to waste around 100 minutes, go watch xXx.

So who qualifies??? You got it!!! Our very own Xander (aka XXX) for a mission to Prague to gather intelligence on some wacko group that is trying to destroy the world (and spread anarchy) with bio-chemical weapons (we've heard that before).

Then forget about reading my review or anybody else's for that matter!  It doesn't take 2 brain cells rubbing together to know what you are going to get here, and you get PLENTY of it!  This was not a typical movie choice for me (my guy's turn to choose), but I had some idea what to expect and I think you do too. Having said that, here is a BIG SURPRISE - this was one of the MOST FUN, simply enjoyable movies I have seen in months, maybe a couple of years!!!  This film is wonderfully unpretentious.  It doesn't take itself too seriously, and we shouldn't either.  Does XXX provide deep intellectual insights, an elegantly constructed production with soul-searching performances, an air-tight plot with masterful dialog, gritty realism, completely true-to-life action scenes, brilliant editing?  Although the answer is obvious (in case you haven't seen the trailer, the answer is NO), a much better question is, WHO CARES?!  This movie is all about fun!  Crazy, mind-blowing, awesome (and in some cases,of course, obviously impossible) extreme stunts!  Diesel is charismatic and charming, the girl is sexy and engaging and the bad guy is appropriately nuts.  The plot is good enough. The way they take out a communications tower doesn't make much sense, but otherwise we'd miss out on another amazing stunt scene so once again, who cares!  (Hey, check out 'Signs', a supposed new masterpiece by a supposed great director, if you want to see a film that really makes no sense!) There's some humor and a few decent one-liners, too.  One of the Bond spoofs is even smartly hilarious (a car stuffed Bond-style with gadgets that end up being virtually useless).  The way this film is NOT extreme is also refreshing.  There is just basic shoot-em-up and action stuff - no extreme violence/gore, no extreme profanity, no extreme sexual content, and no extremely 'important' artistic message.  In other words, nothing to detract from the great fun of a fast-paced, amazing stunt-fest that is light, refreshing, and visually awesome.  The perfect summer action flick!",xXx

Although my main reason to go was to see him, I enjoyed the movie very much. The lines are clever, the stunts were amazing, and Vin's acting performance was very notable. Usually when there are a lot of stunts performed in films, you don't see the actors' faces because it's not them, it's stunt men. It was really awesome to see so much of Vin's face while the stunts were being performed. It was also refreshing to watch the entire movie without too much profanity. It was very sporadic and the 'F' word was not used once. The movie was so good I developed a craving to see it again and it was nice to not be too embarrassed of the movie to take my mother to see it.

The violence is almost as benign as the ""A-team"" but there was a bit too much portrayal of women as objects.",xXx

413,tenchymuyo2,Best FX,10,26 August 2002,I don't know what that other guy was talking about.  The avalanche scene is the key reason I want to see this on my home system.

414,kuribo,Exactly what you'd expect,8,12 December 2002,"Okay, before you see this movie, you have to concede two things. Firstly, that the acting won't be all that great. It's like, alright, Vin Diesel is this big buff dude, and some of the cast members are strictly eye candy with little to no acting talent. However, if you're looking for a top-notch acting job, I suggest you stay away from action films. The second concession you'll have to make is that this movie isn't what you may call ""cerebral entertainment."" By this I mean, you're only going to enjoy it if you go into it knowing what to expect.What to expect is this: A fast-paced thrill ride with one explosion and stunt after another. Sure, there's a plot, but I've seen this movie three times, and all that sticks in my head are the explosions. And that's the way it should be. Vin Diesel isn't intended to be the next sophisticated Hollywood thought-provoking artist. He's a Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwartzenegger for the new generation. And he does well in these types of roles.If you go into this movie, expecting an art-house film, you'll be disappointed. If you go into it expecting a more modernized, American James Bond type film, with less suaveness and more sweat, you may come home happy.Personally, I liked this movie. It did in spades exactly what it set out to do: Be an hour and a half of mindless, pointless eye-candy entertainment, which you can stare at for awhile. Then, you can come out of the theater and go ""OH wow! Did you see that one explosion? That was the bomb!"" Why do people knock movies that aren't ""intelligent"" enough? Not everything is about thinking, and this is one of them. Sit back and enjoy the car chases, explosions, and free falls, because life's too short to analyze everything. I give this movie four stars out of five for being a cinematic, thrill-ride eye candy production that does its job well.",xXx
415,mrusso0154,You can't miss this movie!,10,7 September 2002,Wow! What a great movie! I just saw it today. It was the best two and a half hours I ever spent in the movie theater.

418,jackiechan03-1,gets boring,2,9 November 2002,this film does have what it says .  a lot of action and over the top stunts. but it  is now boring  to watch this kind of action now a days .vin diesel was funny in it . but watching him on the motor bike going through the barbed wire at the columbian  shoot out nearly put me to sleep. there was only one part of the film i was impressed with . the bit were  vin or stunt double  goes over the exploding barn . if that was done 4 real completley then the guy had cuts  it was some crazy and well done jump  oh and asia argento is gorgeous .this kind of action was great in the 80s - early 90s . not now  . back then it was cheesie and  the were not trying to be perfect at the stunts .all my fav action films are from the 80s-90s .  RAMBO 2-3 / ALIENS  and a few others .  and now a days cgi animation films r kicking the ass of action films . and jackie chan is the only one worth watching 4 action .oh and all this  crap about the 1st half an hour of xxx  being worth the admission ticket is a lot of crap.,xXx
419,GDRight,What the Hell?,1,20 January 2003,This one has academy award written all over it. Vin Diesel's perfomance as XXX is sure to win an oscar. If you can't tell I'm joking you obviously haven't seen this movie and your lucky. I don't even need to go into the movie itself. What a joke. This is the perfect example of a Hollywood sellout.

It has no plot, lousy characters, stupid one-liners, and such crappy action that when I think about it I can't even put it into words because there aren't any. Honestly it is that bad.I won't really get into details about what exactly happens in this picture, you can see for yourself at your own risk. One thing that bothers me though is people who actually think ""xXx"" comes close to BOND. IT DOES NOT COME CLOSE TO BOND! The people who say this have probably never watched a Bond flick. The only way this monstrosity compares is with gadgets. By that I mean that all the gadgets in ""xXx"" are probably Q's rejects, because they're so stupid.

He'd rather live out his life being the extreme sportist he is. But, a heavy threat hangs in the air and he is roped into becoming a hero...and winning a woman along the way.Yelena (Argentino) is a far cry different from 'Bond girls' and fights Xander with biting words and suspician along the way of the movie...and we have our own suspicians about her.",xXx

If you want to waste two hours watching a potato faced action hero who's main ability is to be able to find perfectly placed ramps which enable him to leap walls, cars and buildings go ahead.
The only truly amazing thing about this film is that Samuel L. Jackson agreed to be in it. Mr Jackson you should be ashamed.",xXx

426,EmmaGoose,Don't watch it if you don't like action!,5,1 May 2011,"Definitely my kind of movie. Im the kind of person who loves action movies with amazing stunts and killer punch lines. There has to be awesome actors, great settings, smooth characters, heavy music and action sequences that don't lose the plot.And guess what! This ticks all the boxes. I know it may not be the most intelligent thing ever, its not a brain teaser, but it's great entertainment and I just love to see a cool guy kick ass. Especially when its Vin Diesel. The movie is about hardcore stunt man Xander Cage being forced to spy for the government to rid him of his prison sentence. He must infiltrate Russian gang Anarchy 99'. My Favourite Movie!",xXx
427,RokHrd,Awesome ride!,7,12 October 2004,"Total, non-stop thrill ride! Has it all...intrigue, adventure, comic-relief, suspense and romance. This film is James Bond on steroids! Xander Cage uses street-smarts experience and sarcasm versus 007's polished sophistication. The set-up of finding a ""New Breed of Secret Agent"" is just enough to get you prepared. Samuel L. Jackson is excellent as the professional, disciplined veteran who pushes for a real-world solution to counter outdated intelligence methods. Great editing combined with a soundtrack that doesn't allow the film to slow down, ""XXX"" keeps you glued to the story and the camera angles of the GTO put one in mind of the Batmobile. Vin Diesel is the ladies' eye-candy and Asia Argento is simply hypnotic.Another ""unlikely hero"" film, Christian Bale & Taye Diggs in ""Equilibrium"" is equally worthy, albeit along a near-future sci-fi theme.",xXx
428,FEAvera,James Bond meets Rocky Balboa with **** stunts,6,29 January 2005,"For plot, xXx rates a 1.For acting, a 0.For action, a 10.This movie is unbelievably stupid, but somehow people (including me) like it. Just watch it, take it for what it is, and go with the flow. Vin Diesel plays an ""extreme protester"" recruited by ""The Man"" to accomplish some vague mission. Don't get too concerned about the mission, or anything else for that matter. Anything resembling a plot is present only to justify the explosion or parachute jump or whatever impossible physical challenge the stunt-masters have come up with. Just be happy you rented this instead of paid to see it in a theater. Invite your friends over, have a few beers, and enjoy!!!",xXx
429,architeuthis_flux,"Hell, I quite liked it",7,10 March 2005,"All I really wanted when I sat down to watch xXx was an action flick with some sex chucked in, and the odd cool technical thing. Leaving my judgement and values at the door, I waded right into the thick of the strangely harmless gunfire, unlikely situations and ho-hum dialogue, and I enjoyed myself thoroughly. I don't care whether Vin Diesel can act or not - and he can, in my opinion - I think he's gorgeous, and he certainly has the physical presence to fill this role with the requisite amount of aplomb. He might be a thug, but he's a thug with a soft voice, bright eyes, and big muscles - and he's perfect as Xander Cage. Candy for the brain, candy for the eyes - that's what xXx is, and I like candy once in a while.",xXx
430,kdrussell-63452,Great for steaming,8,29 July 2018,The writing is well below average with both the premise of the stunts (although entertaining) and some of the dialogue; but the quality of the actoring somewhat helps make up for it. This makes it a great steaming movie on par with modern high budget action films that Vin Diesel also appears in.,xXx
431,sterling-10,"""Third Man"" music played in background in ""XXX""",8,15 August 2002,"When Cage walked into the club in Prague, you can hear music very similar to Carol Reed's ""The Third Man"". There is even a quick shot of a ""zither"" playing the music, the same instrument made famous by ""The Third Man"". Thought that was interesting. The movie though had some great action sequences, but overall, it doesn't take the cake. Even though, this is a ""must see"" movie.",xXx
432,Woofi,"A new, improved, James Bond?",6,11 August 2002,"Just finished watching the film and it certainly kept me interested from the beginning to the end.  James Bond has needed a major face lift for a while, and switching the main character from a Martini-drinking debonair sophisticated Brit to a tattooed hunk was a very good start.  The stunts, for the most part, stretched reality to the point of disbelief, kind of like stretching a chiclet to the moon.  Let's face it - parachuting onto a mountain, setting off an avalanche, and out-chasing the avalanche and a half dozen armed men on snowmobiles, all while only on a snowboard is a real trick.  But just for fun appeal, I definitely give this film my thumbs-up.",xXx
433,Gibe,no brain,1,2 March 2003,"This movie was an awsome blockbuster. I'm really disapointed with that fact. This means that a lot of people loved it and this movie is only for no brain teens. No story, nothing good in it. I'm really afraid they gonna do a sequel.",xXx
434,pokeefe90,"Worst movie ever, but...",1,1 February 2003,"...hilarious for that very same reason. I went into this film with the expectation that it was either going to ""bad/bad"" or ""bad/good."" It turned out to be the latter. In a way, watching this movie was kind of sad. You know that everyone working on this film thought they were making a really cool movie, but it ended up being embarrassingly terrible. For the love of it all, XXX pulls tricks on his motorbike while he dodges bullets and escapes from explosions!Another point to mention is that if you only read the dialogue of this movie, you would have no clue what it was about. It's all just really lame one-liners! But then again, that's what makes it so funny.I highly recommend this film if, like me, you enjoy absurdly terrible films.",xXx
435,michaeldent,A shelved video game,5,10 August 2002,Before going to see this film discharge any sense of logic. The action scenes have some very cool stunt work yet most were so far-fetched it makes you winch. It was an attempt at creating a James Bondish human video game yet I think watching 'SlamBall' would prove to be more of a successful venture. Vin Diesel has a brighter future in film once he abandons the search for a quick quip and learns to put some emotion in the performances. I had a feeling I should have requested a ticket to see 'signs' but my 12 and 14 year old sons asked enthusiastically for this movie instead - they did enjoy the film. I guess they may have been the intended audience.,xXx
436,vettejetevan74,This action movie is underrated,8,11 April 2006,"When most people see this movie they think it is overrated. As for me, I think it is underrated. For an action lover like myself, it keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire movie. While the plot is very weak, it has very cool fighting sequences which in a way override a weak plot. It was a huge plus to have Vin Diesel as the star because he is a straight up monster! Asia Argento adds the spice to make it an all-around awesome movie. While Xander Cage (Vin Diesel) is a spy in a fake espionage movie, people in the movie show him as a rebel that has mass skills with sports and Grand Theft Auto. He will stop at nothing to do what he must do.",xXx
437,dudecalledrik,Don't bother watching this stinker.,1,1 October 2007,"This movie is a waste of time. First, the story lacks any semblance of intelligence. If you're the kind of person who craves action, and doesn't really care too much about thinking, then you might enjoy the first half of this ""movie"" about an extreme athlete who is recruited by some ""government agency"" to atone for breaking the law. However, holes in the plot become apparent to even the most caffeine-riddled video gamer or couch potato. Second, the ""action"" sequences are too long and pose as a never-ending showcase for Diesel's character to reinforce what you already know: He's and extreme athlete. Some of the stunts would have been better served to move the story along, rather than keeping it stagnate. Finally, as much as it pains me to say this, one of the worst performances was by Jackson. For a guy who cranked out great characters in such movies as Pulp Fiction, Red Violin and Unbreakable, he sure looked disinterested when reciting his lines in this picture. I had to stop watching it after one hour. Save yourself the rental fee.",xXx
438,zackg-3,A great movie I think it is very well done,10,11 October 2006,"xXx is a very good movie I don't get what the other people are saying about this movie. I have seen over 10 times and every time it just gets better! This is very good quality movie with some very very funny scenes in it. If you are a fan of Vin Diesel you will love this movie just as much as I did this goes beyond what bond does in his lame ass movies. This brings something new to the spy genre just because someone else makes a movie about spies it is just like James Bond? This movie brings xander cage into the scene as a stunt junkie with a bad ass attitude set in a plot to save the world from destruction. WHAT COULD BE BETTER!!! This is a good movie and I extremely recommend buying this. Good acting, Hot girls, and a awesome plot and writing.10 stars",xXx
439,focusedwolf,This movie is cool :P,10,27 November 2006,"Was on TV other day and i have to say i really enjoyed it. Especially like the dialogue about stealing the car of that senator kinda guy that wants to do away with all violent music and video games. ""Come on Dick, it's the only education we got"". Ahahaha...thoughts of my generation XD. The movie had that awesome looking GTO. They killed a bond-ish guy in beginning to show ya how outdated that character is. That awesome looking revolver. That part where triple x runs right into meet with the head badguy. lol this movie is priceless.Their are those parts where the movie feels scripted and unreal...like the diner scene... how could triple X know about stock brokers? Just doesn't fit with the character :P O yea the part about ""playstation-ing it up"" and the expression of that Russian police guy + that camcorder rocket launcher sorta kill that scene, but then thriple X kills the big bad boss with a gun...not many bond movie head-badguy's die in such a practical way so that makes up for this.Video games, Weird Russian police girl, Nice Guns, Nice car, Stunts...it's kinda like that game grand-theft-auto + james bond... games bond lol",xXx
440,cemgrinder,Not fun at all,5,25 July 2006,"While at first glance, it may seem as though this movie has some elements to make it quite an entertainer namely action, guns, explosions, stunts and special effects, it really does not deliver despite having all those. The only one who knows how to act in this movie is Samuel L Jackson and the rest of the cast really ruin any potential with their third rate acting effort. This business of bad ass attitude plus extreme sports angles in a twist to a James Bond theme or anything else, just does not work. It is supposed to be cool but it really ends up looking lame. The only moment I could call memorable in this movie is when the colombian drug-lord comes in as a total loser and gets laughed at ""Funeee guuyy"" and of course, the intro concert by Rammstein.",xXx
441,CryingWhitch,not every movie has to be logic..this one is just fun,8,29 July 2006,Some people may think that this movie is totally not logic but to me it is great. I like movies with a good story and some logic but sometimes I just want to see a movie in which thinks explode and were's a lot of shooting and no logic because I just want to watch it and not think about it. Movies are made to entertain people and to enjoy yourself watching it not to take it apart in pieces and afterward yell that it's not logical.... Besides..who needs logic when there's a man like Vin Diesel in a movie...(sorry but I am a woman after all...) And hey who cares if there's a weapon made of a handy cam...don't look at that as an unlogical thing but look at it as a smart idea...would you think of that yourself? Probably not. And would you take an action movie seriously if the explosions were small... if the explosions were really realistic? Sometimes they just have to make it bigger than it would be in reality to make it worth watching and to make it exciting. So don't go examinating every movie...just enjoy.,xXx

The acting and script are so bad it is just amazing. Vin Diesel can not act, nor can anyone else in this film or so it seems. The stunts are rubbish, are not believable at all. The James Bond movies beat this film by a mile. I am just amazed at why this film was every made at all or why anyone likes it. It is a lame Hollywood attempt of a spy film and it fails.The ending is bad as well, to be honest i don't know if there is anything good about this film.

The story line is well connected together everything seems to fit in well. i enjoyed watching it with my friends and by myself. the story takes a bad ass criminal sends him in to save the world he falls in love and well you can watch the movie to find out the rest. the sequel is not quite as good but also worth the watch.",xXx

The editing is so horrible that in the action sequences you get lost, theres no sense of orientation and in other suspense scenes it goes back and forward in time between the clips. There's more but that would spoil it for the people who doesn't care what I write and will go and see it anyway.The thing that kept it from getting a one was the first 20seconds, they should have filmed a Rammstein consert instead.",xXx

They are SOOOOO drawn out and over the top it's like the director is laughing at you with every sequence. I went into this expecting a fun and at least somewhat SMART action movie ala James Bond or Mission Impossible. What I got was a Universal Studios stunt show with high school drama dialogue. The only somewhat exiting sequence is the snow boarding one and even with that you have to suspend ALL disbelief. Overall an absolute horrid and pointless piece of trash. When this goes to DVD I'm sure I'll see it in the comedy section.

There is high-tech, non-stop Action!!! Xander Cage do every kind of extreme sport: Snowboarding, Motor Cross,... And the stunt with the car, that fall from the bridge is really great! And at the beginning the song is absolutely mega cool! Rammstein with Feuer Frei! It's fantastic! I recommend this film to every Action-Fan! It is James Bond mixed with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Superman! The film is a mixture of James Bond, The Fast and the Furious, and The Rock! It is (in my opinion) the BEST Action-Movie EVER!

Then, dream up your own ending! it'll be 50 times better than what they came up with. Watching the ending honestly made me very frustrated, because I could of rented something a lot better. Vin Diesel is not very believable actor.. he's probably as popular as he is today, because of his body. The stunts in the movie were awesome, which is probably the only thing that kept me from turning it off. The over all plot wasn't bad.

Fans of the Fast & the Furious will note similarities through the fantastic cinematography.  Rob Cohen did an excellent job!!!  This is not a movie for the faint at heart.  Non stop action throughout 6/8th of the movie. It's a movie for the Gen X for sure & I foresee xXx to be the 1st of many.  The stunts were at times almost unbelievable, but at the same time awesome to see!!!  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves action & definitely to those who love Extreme sports!!

Even when watching it for free I could barely bring myself to watch the entire thing.  Whoever decided that Vin Diesel should be in movies should be hunted down and punished for his sins against humanity.  Then again, there is one type of person who likes this movie.  An idiot.  So if you are an idiot, by all means watch this movie and enjoy what should be outlawed by the Geneva Convention.  Also, if you're not sure if you're an idiot or not, watch this movie.

465,Soul_Survivor_Dj,Vin Diesel's Pitch Black and Boiler Room Can't Top xXx,3,4 January 2003,"When I saw previews for this movie, I thought it'd be an okay film with a lot of action. To my surprise, it was utter garbage, with some of the most over the done ridiculous and not believable action scenes. If they wanted to make this film awesome or exciting, don't make them go through 15 to 20 minutes of action and missions that turn out to be a test in the end. That's what half the movie is actually, and the action scenes and stunts for the testing period seemed to be more thrilling and exciting then the actual intended action that comes later. Another thing I couldn't stand about this film was the acting. The acting sucked hardcore, I couldn't believe Vin Diesel went from his magnificent and excellent performances in Pitch Black and Boiler Room to this utter piece of s---! It wasn't only Vin Diesel, it was everyone else, including the excellent Samuel L. Jackson (which seems hard to believe) and Asia Argento (who's career has been known for her movies where she takes off her clothes and doesn't put them back on again). The action scene in the end with him outrunning an avalanche is completely flawed. No one can out run an avalance that's going 200 - 300 miles an hour and someone outrunning it on a snowboard that's going 80 - 100 miles an hour. The action is this may be over the top but true movie fans would notice the flaws and the boring dull action scenes. If they made it accurate, maybe my opinion would go up a little, but I doubt it. The story line is also a joke because when I was watching it, I remembered almost 13 other action films that were the same exact thing. Overall, xXx is a complete waste of time and is just a poor excuse for action and excitement. I think the film was only made for all the teen girls to see it so Vin Diesel can take off his shirt. I'd give it a *1/2 out of ****. Now I want to know why they want to make a sequel out of this s---ty movie. xXx is resently stupid and is as dumb as a box of rocks.",xXx
466,Jedi Wills,Good fun tongue-in-cheek action spy romp!,5,29 September 2002,"Despite being an American straight copy of our home grown James Bond, I quickly warmed to the character of Xander Cage. No matter how cool it would be to be a spy, it becomes harder and harder every year to relate to Mr Bond, with his Tuxedo's, Dinner Parties and Martini's, whereas rough and ready Xander embodies todays culture and society, drinking pints, checking out metal core nightclubs, driving fast cars and blowing stuff up, he's just out to have fun! And I for one (and I know alot of other people will too) can relate to that. And I think this is where xXx succeeds, by creating a semi-believable character, creating this person, that could quite easily be anyone, not just the Oxford/Harvard top-of-the-class toff. I can see this becoming a big franchise.Story-wise is a slight dissapointment, the copy of the Bond Baddie is just that, a Bond Baddie, there is no altering of perception here, its just the same old, same old, bond bad guy here. As usual he wants to blow up the world, but not really for any logical reason. Ive always wondered in films like this, why do the evil henchmen and scientists create these chemical/nuclear/biological weapons, to get a fat pay check, so their boss may destroy the world. Do they think they can still spend their $50,000,000 in a post apocalyptic environment. And this kinda dissapointed me too. If your going to ground a character in reality and get people to relate to him, then you've got to create a believable story.The Script however, doesnt let down at all. It is incredibly punchy, with some brilliant one liners from Xander and one or two other good ones from the secondary characters.Overall this film is a lot of fun. Its worth seeing purely for Vin Diesel's excellent portrayal of this character. This will make Vin Diesel into the action star he deserves to be.",xXx
467,MattGts2000,Hollywood's New Low.,1,15 August 2002,"I was able to see XXX a few nights ago, and was quite excited prior to the opening credits to the film. The movie's opening was good, a dark gothic death-metal club paints a very morbid picture of the movie's bad guy. After this point the movie portrays nothing more than Hollywood's attempt to turn a video game into a movie, only that video games are much more believable than this movie. This trifle of a film only shows what not to do as a follow up to a blockbuster that you had the previous summer. With unbelievable characters, and even worse dialogue, this film should be forgotten by all that see it.  However the movie does have an upside, the soundtrack consisting of such bands as HateBreed, Rammstein, and Bush's Gavin Rossdale provides somewhat of an escape from the harsh reality of the movie.",xXx

All I can come up with by way of explanation for the current low rating is that a bunch of 70's burn-outs who don't even know what a FPS is, might have skewed the rating in this rare instance.  Suffice to say, if you are a Die Hard or Terminator fan, or a HALO or Splinter Cell aspirant or master, XXX will not disappoint you.",xXx

I don't know, can't tell, or don't care if Diesel is a wonderful actor, but he plays this role like he was born to do it!  (Nevermind that I could just stare at him alone for 2 hours!)  The movie itself is a fast-paced, energetic action flick geared more towards teen-aged boys fresh from their X-boxes and Playstations, but as an adult woman, it was very enjoyable nonetheless!  I would recommend it to anyone who wanted to forget about their lives and worries for a little while and be absorbed in something that seems sometimes unreal, but very entertaining and fun over-all.",xXx

It's the high-budget, ridiculous-stunt-packed, everything-explodes action movie equivalent of Plan 9 From Outer Space.How director, writers, and actors can even attach their names to a product so horrible across the board is mind-boggling.  It looks like someone ate John Woo's entire catalog and then threw up.But if you love movies from which expect no entertainment other than to laugh at its complete failure, this is your movie for 2002.  And of course, make sure to surround yourself with those people who yell ""PULL THE PARACHUTE!  PULL IT STUPID!

Another annoyance i felt was with the 'athlete' portion of vin's charecter.  I didn't think that it would be good to, while fleeing in gunfire, steal silver tray from a resturaunt and do a rail grind, ollie, and reverse to another rail to help him get away.  Another stupid stung was (one of the times when vin got a dirt bike) he did a 'superman' grab to get in better position to shoot someone... seems unnecessary if you ask me.  But there was one nice touch, most of the movie was in untranslated russian (to avoid unnecessary plot), although they were nice enough to translate a few cheesy one liners... one in particular comes to mind ""catch him fast, kill him slow""Overall, avoid this movie at all costs.  If someone you know rents it in a few months when it comes out on VHS, and DVD with all those special features i'm sure there will be... maybe watch it then but expect to make fun of it.one last warning, there will be people saying this movie is great because vin diesel is so cool, and he does such awsome stunts and there are explosions woah cool!!!  but those people are mindless idiots and wouldn't know a good movie if it hit them in the face.",xXx

The director, Rob Cohen, most recently known for the high adrenaline rush of a movie, ""The Fast and The Furious"", has completed yet another crowd pleaser. The movie combines the elements of action, suspense, and drama to form ANOTHER adrenaline rush movie. The movie describes the story of a sports daredevil, Xander Cage (Diesel)who is just about at the end of his free ride in the world, with all the s*** he gets away with. He has a run-in with Gibbons (Jackson) who gives him the opportunity to do something completely out of his shell, and help the country which is threatening to put him away for all his crimes. Things start to spiral out of control after that, when Cage realizes that he is getting into deeper stuff than he ever imagined possible. His cover is later blown, but it doesn't seem to faze him much. Gibbons decides he should be removed from the case, and has everything he has taught Cage about thrown back in his face, when his realized that Cage isn't going anywhere. Diesel goes from racing illegally with sick looking cars and something around every corner, to jumping out of cars falling off a bridge, and blowing up parts of the mountain to create an avalanche that traps the bad guys, leaving him to snowboard off home free. (For awhile at least) He gives an awesome performance, and everyone should go see this movie. Proving that he not only has sex appeal, but can act in any situation given to him. He'll be around for some time to come. It definitely gets ""2 Thumbs Up""",xXx

It's hard to blame him though because the lines were so bad it was impossible to make a good delivery of them (like the script of Attack of the Clones).

484,dcbortz,This movie was a waste of the 35-mm stock it was shot on.,2,12 August 2002,"Vin Diesel's extreme sports approach to the spy saga was illogical, witless, and just plain stupid.  All aspects of this movie were flawed.  The stunt work may seem entertaining and fun to the average 7th grader, but jumping a dirtbike 20 feet in the air without any form of ramp is just plain implausible and impossible (and don't forget, this sequence was probably the most well-done of all the action sequences in this film).  There was very little sense of time or reality.  The tech nerd that Vin works with in this film manages to do the work of 30 people by himself and in half the time (for example, fully customizing a GTO and packing it full of weapons in a matter of hours), and the gadgets he creates, like the binoculars that see through walls, are so far fetched that a 7 year old would consider them corny.  There are more things wrong with this movie than there are right things.  The script (if there even was a script) was was cliche and full of terrible one liners.  The script managed to be both unoriginal and witless at the same time. It even stole one line directly from a Bond movie! Kudos to writer Rich Wilkes on this one.

That anyone would willingly allow the creation of such a mindless, poorly-written truckload of intellectually bankrupt drivel is entirely beyond me.  Shame on the writer for accepting money for falling asleep on his keyboard and calling it a script (as well as for soiling the good name of ""The Vandals,"" by quoting ""Anarchy Burger"" - I hope they got paid a good amount to allow use of their lyrics in this ""film;"" and if they didn't, it's time for a copyright infringement lawsuit).  Shame on Vin Diesel for doing a decent film like Boiler Room, and then making ""The Fast and the Furious"" look like ""Schindler's List,"" by making ""XXX,"" all the while accepting the 10 million he demanded for the role.  It was literally a pleasure to see a total of fifteen people in the entire theatre.  It was downright satisfying to see two people leave within the first five minutes.  Hopefully, word of mouth can spread on how awful this is, and we can just let the wretched thing writhe in pain, as it drowns in its own shame for deliberately poisoning so many perfectly good minds.  If you appreciate the fact that your body produces energy for you to perform any function, including seeing movies, you will spare it the humiliation of having wasted all of those nutrients, which it went through lengthy chemical processes to digest, on seeing the cinematic equivalent of septic leakage, known as ""XXX.""

I dont think the producers thought this thing through much past the hype and special effect aspect.  The action is almost non-stop, which can be good, however it was overdone in this case.  I think that just about everything in the movie was combustible.  They could have tossed a bicycle off a cliff and it would've burst into flames.  The dialogue (or lack there of) was also pretty bad....lots of poor cliches...very bad script.  The entire movie was really a cliche.  You have probably already seen near replicas of this movie in the past.  It follows the typical ""good guy has to stop the villain who wants to take over the world"" scenario.  It has no surprises...you can figure out just about everything that will happen ahead of time.  Overall, i was thoroughly disappointed. It really didnt have anything to offer except some hype.

There is more action in this movie than I can remember in most of the classic Bond films put together.  I loved every minute of the loud music, guns, and numerous explosions.  That is what action movies are all about.  No one ever went to see 007 because the dialogue was great or of Oscar calibur.  No way did anyone ever watch Bruce Willis in any of the Die Hard movies because his lines and the plot were real and deep and had meaning. No we watch them because they blow crap up and they have cool gadgets and do things that we dream about doing while we are sitting at the office typing another Monday morning memo.  For all those claiming that XXX is a ripoff lets just consider the fact that everything that can be done has been done. So now Hollywood is left with the prospect that they have to put a new spin on old ""classics"" that no longer apply to the younger generation.  Hence the extreme sports/ Bond angle, please don't demonstrate your lack of intelligence by assuming that people think this is something new.

In this film, there are too many problems to list. However, here are a few.Where was the writer?  Obviously, the script was bought and the writer was not brought aboard to work on it as the film went on.  The story was weak and beaten to death.  Disgruntled foreigner gets mad and wants to kill everybody and cause worldwide panic.  Wow.  What a concept.  Actually, if done properly, it can be a good concept.  There were only a few things running against it being truly good.  They are Vin Diesel, the Director, the production crew and the continuity supervisor.  Unfortunately, all of these were involved in this film.The continuity alone is enough to drive the average viewer insane.  From a GTO that can drive through Prague at 80 MPH (in the city), but can't go that fast in straight-aways to a deadly toxin that is rendered impotent by water. Water?  Yes.  Water.  I guess no one wanted to do any research and look for compounds that don't dilute quickly and become ineffective in water.  Am I asking too much in asking to SOME thought process while developing this film?Then there is Vin Diesel.  I can guarantee you, he was a much better bouncer than he ever will be an actor.  Does he have only one tone to his voice? It's okay for a short film or small part in a film, but a whole feature? It's like listening to Schwarzenegger, but he can do some acting.  A body and a voice do not an actor make.  Do you know who Jeff Chandler is? Exactly!Stay away from this film like the plague.  It's just bad.  The only good thing is the lead female who is a Russian spy.  If all spies looked like her and moved like her, there would be chaos in the world.  Unfortunately, it is not worth the $9.00 to go see her only.  It would be best to get it on cheap rental day at the video store.  Then, get a group of people together to pull money to 'share the pain'.  Hey, $0.50 out of your pocket is better than $9.00.I'd rather watch Howard the Duck again.I'm going to go get a mint.

493,Prhod2,What a movie,1,27 October 2002,"I was really looking forward to watching this film, with all the hype, how could it be bad. WRONG.This has to be the worst movie have I have ever seen, great effects, but what about the acting.",xXx
494,andipandi,James Bond of the New Millennium?,9,19 August 2002,"It is currently 1:30 in the AM and I am so excited about seeing the movie Triple X that I needed an outlet to comment!  What a ride this movie turned out to be.  I had heard a lot of hype but knowing the quality of a Vin Diesel film, this movie was definitely up to par.  There's just something about his antihero that is so compelling - or is that his physique?  I digress.  What a wonderful opportunity to see, what my elders' call, an action film geared towards ""my generation.""  I found that in the last James Bond movie there were all of the classic elements of a ""Bond"" film but there was just something missing.  I could not put my finger on it - that was until now.That key, missing element was extreme sports.  I mean let's face it, 007 is an older guy.  He looks awesome in a tux - a towel too.  His British accent and great smile sends shivers down many 'a civilized women's spine.  Yet, he's old and somewhat tame.  Vin Diesel roars on the scene with more action, quick wit, good looks and butt-kickin' than any one man should be allowed on film!  He completely dominates this movie.  And it's delicious - right down to his low-ridin' long john's!Okay, all the girlie stuff aside, the film was sound.  The story had no visible ""main-plot"" holes, it wasn't bogged down with cross-plot details, and it let up on the action a fraction of a second before you thought your head would explode.  I unfortunately had a rather tame Monday night crowd, but I suspect that weekend crowds might applaud - or at least let a few ""SWEET""s or ""NU'UH""s loose here and there.  This film gives you just enough sex and violence to be believable (if a modern Bond could ever be considered real) - but its edited so expertly as to come off as ""classy.""  I honestly, hope that this will turn into a series.  After all, if Austin Powers can go for thirds, Zander is definitely due for seconds!",xXx
495,lokogato,"Hands down, one of the worst movies I've ever seen",1,23 August 2002,"Please don't waste your time with this movie.  Don't allow the marketing muscle of the studios or the hype surrounding Diesel convince you that this worth your time.  My friends almost gave me a serious beat-down for making go see this POS.  This movie insulted me, my friends, and our intelligence. The Script was horrible, the action scenes were endless and ridiculous, and the supposed funny lines were simply horrible.  Look, you can probably get funnier lines from Alan Greenspan than the 'funny' lines in this film.The avalanche scene ranks as one of the worst and least-believable scenes I've ever had the displeasure of watching.",xXx
496,memphisraines,TRUE SUMMER FILM,10,30 August 2002,"Long gone have the days of summer films been. Remember those? Every year there was the one film during the summertime that everybody and I mean EVERYBODY went to see. Jurrassic Park? Armageddon? Mission Impossible 2? We haven't had one in years but in xXx, the latest installment from Rob Cohen (helmer of Fast and the Furious) and Vin Diesel (Fast and the Furious, Pitch Black), it's back and in a big way. I admit I initially had my reservations but left the theater highly impressed. NON STOP ACTION, WITTY DIALOGUE (A script far superior than FAST AND THE FURIOUS, which really wasn't that bad itself), and a killer soundtrack... This has been one of the few movies I've seen recently worth it's price of admission. If you're a fan of Diesel's or just pure action, give it a shot.",xXx
497,lemonada,James Bond who...?,10,3 September 2002,I recently saw XXX and was blown away by it! Vin Diesel is amazing in this action-packed film about the Russian rebel world. What also apealed to me was the fact that it was set in Prague and not the usual New York or London. James Bond cowers in the shadow of xXx! Deffinetly a must-see movie.,xXx
498,nicolebrennen,good review,10,9 September 2002,"TripleX (XXX) is an awesome movie, it has lots of non-stop action.I saw this movie twice. The first time was great, the second time was even better.It is worth seeing when it comes out on DVD. The book is as good as the movie.",xXx
499,KingNothng18,James Bond watch out,10,10 September 2002,"I think this is definitly a awesome movie.  If you like James Bond, you will like this.  It is filled with action packed scenes almost every minute of the movie and not to mention the stunning women in it.  it is fun for all genders.",xXx
500,BeAmStAh,heh heh,6,4 October 2002,"First of all, anyone who gave this a bad rating does not realise the concept of Action, I dont initially consider action to be one of the best genres, but this film does considerably well. I find this movie for a younger audience like myself. It has lots of action (but sometimes goes overboard with it). For example in the avalanch scene, there is no way in the world that a snow board can go much faster then a avalanch with less then a 20 second head start. Overall the movie had its advantages. Vin Diesel played very well for his character, the weapons and the car is awesome. The plot and the script were not so much up there. but it still was a good movie.",xXx
501,mooey2,This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen!,1,3 February 2003,"I liked Vin Diesel before I watched this movie, afterward.....ouch! His lines were so rehearsed and acted that he was truly terrible. The amount of cliques was out of hand making the dialogue pathetic. The plot was ridiculous, c'mon, a gas that is released from a goofy looking boat streaming down a river in the mountains into Prague. Does anyone really think that a river could flow through a ski community then into a major city without a waterfall, dam or some sort of drop??????",xXx
502,chemicalbaby,Where did the time go??,9,26 October 2002,"I have just watched xXx, and couldn't believe the time after it finished, when I realised that I had been in the cinema for over two hours, I was amazed. This film is superb. There is no edge of your seat stuff, or long explanations and the film doesnt need it. My brain felt blissfully sponge like throughout. You can just sit back and relax and take in all the action eye candy. The stunts range from the ""have got the tshirt"" explosions to fantastic, imaginative and creative stunts, that I doubt James Bond would ever consider. Probably not quite sophisticated enough. Not that i am slating James Bond, but this film takes all of the best bits of Bond, and then adds just enough attitude to lift it above. And not much in the way of sex!! Rather than giving us the what feels like the obligatory scene, it was only implied which for an action film is good, because it keeps the pace of the film that much faster (and also a 12A rating). This is a film that I will buy, its just like Tomb Raider, but with more tattoos.",xXx
503,st11,Utter Rubbish,1,28 October 2002,"As soon as I heard Yo Yo Dude, you just knew it was going to be bad.. over the top Yank crap, half of it was inaudible, the other half was some strange language we English just don't get!. Yo Yo Dude.. funny really!!Thank god for Prague, which was without doubt the highlight of the film. That was actually surprising, I mean for a film which got it all wrong, managed to get the location so right, shame it had some talent less Gung Ho American running around it.James bond you are not and unfortunately could never be.   Why Hollywood thought the world needed an American Special agent is beyond me. Somethings you just aint so good at.. Please no sequal!",xXx
504,peterweenink,This movie is a joke!,3,29 October 2002,"What's wrong with the film industry? This movie is one big joke. Only the carjacking part at the beginning of the movie is fun to watch. It takes real actors to make a great movie. I have only one request for the movie producers: Please, don't even think about making XXX part II.",xXx
505,iouliach,Adrenaline,10,1 November 2002,"Vin Diesel is great as a spy, Asia - not so great, because only russian can play russian, but she did her best. New kind of spy story, what can be better? Young, clever and talented actors in a action movie - what can be better? I just would like to wish to all the actors success and all the best!!!",xXx
506,lauri_neal,James Bond for the millenium,8,6 November 2002,"The film was,for me, an update on an old formula. James Bond was good in his heyday but for me Xander Cage was a more amusing, up-to-date and entertaining. Stunts, as in Bond films, totally over the top but it is escapist entertainment afterall.Just so long as Vin doesn't take himself too seriously the next two films should be worth waiting for...Best described as chewing gum for the brain but sometimes that just fits the bill after a stressful week at work!",xXx
507,slash314,"And I thought watching ""Vertical Limit"" was the worst experience this year!",1,9 November 2002,"Idiotic dialogues, stupid plot, awful sound track. It was not even funny the way ""James Bond"" films may be. The main actor could have been replaced by a wooden stick, without me being able to tell the difference ( Actually thats not true it would have been such a major improvement, because the dialogues are mainly spoiled by his part, that this wouldn't have passed unnoticed.). I have seldom seen worse  movies than this one.",xXx
508,kittenita-1,"great action film, but don't ask for more.",10,15 April 2003,"I personally loved the action scenes, one after another. The bike stunts were great to see in application, there were lots of awesome gadgets and cars, planes, helicopters. I also enjoyed the humor, and the filming. (I prefer this film to the latest James Bond in fact.) It was thrilling to watch and I thoroughly enjoyed it!",xXx
509,necrovile,TRIPLE POOR,4,26 August 2003,"TRIPLE POORWe've seen it before: some psycho doesn't agree with the world order, secures some biological weapons and tries to change the way things are going on. Of course, he never succeeds, because we always have a hero armed to the teeth, fighting against all dangers and taking many risks for his country and ultimately for the entire world. What we get is an explosive fight between the good and the bad ones, with a lot of gun shots, hot pursuits and everything the special effects allow.OK, sometimes we need an adrenaline kick, cars flying in the air, buildings exploding, furious muscles spreading fists and bullets around etc. In this case, the story is almost a minor thing, it has a beginning and an end, which is in 99% of the cases the same: the good guys eliminate the bad ones and save the world again. What matters is the way the story develops and is shown to us. The elements of the movie must create an equilibrium in order to make the action watchable.In XXX everything is poor. The script (following an idea that has been cooked and overcooked by many other movies) is full of clichés and has nothing to be praised for. The direction is weak and rather messes around. Vin Diesel is an extra in this movie; the only thing that `impresses' is his beefy tattooed body. The stuff he's doing in XXX is something for Pierce Brosnan & co. Vin is rather a street fighter, maybe something like in `Knockaround Guys'. Asia Argento (the Russian secret agent) is as bad as her accent. The ex-military clique is unconvincing and no real harm as bad guys. And what is Samuel L. Jackson doing in this movie ?! Oh, I got it: he was also in `Deep Blue Sea' 'on duty' (who watched it, knows what I'm talking about).I don't have to talk about flaws anymore, because the entire movie is a flaw in the cinematography.My rating: 4 out of 10 (for the team's efforts to get our money with a pile of muscles, some stunts and a very good actor who seems to have got lost among Hollywood's pay offices).",xXx
510,Mistress_midnight,Interesting Glitch,10,5 January 2003,"I found it interesting that you can see one of the film crew in the end of scene 16, beginnging of Scene 17 on the DVD.

It is so clear, I can't believe the editors didn't catch it.",xXx

While the situations and action and stunts were indeed unrealistic and ridiculous, it was all set forth to produce a fun and enjoyable film. And while the acting was not Academy Award material, the diologue was funny, and Vin made a convincing meat-head action star. This film made me laugh. I give it a 6.",xXx
512,unclebubby,One-liners and explosions - 'nuff said!,6,6 March 2003,"No, this movie isn't overly intellectual.  No, it doesn't have a deep social consciousness.  No, it's not very deep. Yes, it' has a lot of fantastic stunts. Yes, a lot of things explode. Yes, Vin Diesel and others spout off some great one-liners (""Slap me again and I'm gonna throw you a beatin'""). It ain't Oscar material but it sure is FUN!",xXx

514,MattOnTheNet,It´s entertainment; just that,7,9 April 2003,"I don´t understand all the commotion in the user opinion section. Is Van Diesel a decent actor or is he not.  Can somebody shoot a gun while flying through the air or not? Are the Beatles better than the Stones or is Wet Wet Wet a better band than the Backstreet Boys? It´s entertainment, nothing more. James Bond uses devices not yet invented and Frodo has hairy feet. If you want to comment on the contents and value of a movie I think you must take another movie like Schindler´s List (10+ !), not a movie that was produced purely for the fun. Sit back, enjoy the ride, don´t expect any deep going conversation and just have fun.",xXx
515,neuromante72,Unwatchable,1,25 April 2003,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. A bunch of B-movie stereotypes, explosions and situations that even a 10-year-old action movie fan would find ridiculuos, exXxagerated and out of any reality and believableness. Noisy, boring and acted truly bad. From the worst of the action movies of the eighties, the new worst for the new millennium.",xXx
516,dpaul38,Strap in for a thrill ride,8,1 May 2003,"I once predicted, in my weekly newspaper column, a big future in the movie business for Vin Diesel (Pitch Black, The Boiler Room) and it seems director Rob Cohen has the same idea.After being the driving force behind Cohen's The Fast and the Furious Diesel has followed him into this salute to James Bond.He stars as extreme sports hero and anarchist Xander Cage e spotted by the National Security Agency as a possible alternative to their usual run-of-the-mill spies, who are easy to spot and keep winding up dead.His new boss, Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson), thinks Xander will fit right in with Prague-based group Anarchy 99, led by Yorgi (Marton Csokas), to gather intelligence. Initially he sees them as just a band of ex-Russian soldiers out for a good time but there is something more sinister afoot which could result in the deaths of billions.Yorgi's mysterious girlfriend Yelena (Asia Argento) also adds a little more flavour to the mix.If you are looking for the ultimate no-brainer thrill ride then look no further.And what a ride it is, with the viewer is treated to one mind-boggling stunt after another set to the beat of a killer soundtrack, featuring Rammstein, Drowning Pool, Queens of the Stone Age, Gavin Rossdale and Orbital.In true action movie style it's riddled with plot holes, the plot is wafer thin, most characters are undeveloped and Xander escapes a few too many unbelievable situations but it's all done with so much style that all I have to say is `who cares'. To paraphrase Monty Python, I may not know art at times but I know what I like.Vin Diesel was born to play this role he has the look, the sound and the style and Asia Argento, daughter of Italian horror maestro Dario Argento, makes a more than passable leading lady for the situation and New Zealander Marton Csokas makes an oily villain.Strap in, enjoy the ride, and if you really like it you can look forward to the sequel.",xXx
517,smiley317,Vin Diesel plays a breath taking action hero,10,5 May 2003,he played the part so well and he did a very good good at the funny scenes and i hope that the 2 one is just as good as the 1st one and hope that he stays an actor for along time. there were some parts that i wish he would have done different but he did a very great job and he will be around for along time,xXx
518,WonderWoman517,Fantastic flick!!,10,16 December 2003,"This was the first time I had seen Vin Diesel in anything, and I have since become a huge fan!  The action meshes with the plot extremely well, and I could watch it daily and not tire of it.  There are twists and turns to the plot that you don't expect, and it makes the movie very delightful.  I enjoy action movies, and this is #1 in my collection.  It includes great effects, great costumes, and great actors!  If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for?",xXx
519,goddess4_hire,What a movie,3,2 June 2003,When I saw this movie all I could think of was MTV. I think it will be known as the longest music videos known to man. Where did the good movies go? I would NEVER pay to see a movie like this again. I am sorry to say that I did pay to see it.,xXx
520,marcosjp,Trash version of good 007 movies,1,28 September 2003,"This movie is a waste of time. This is a poor and stupid version of the so much better James Bond movies - all the old well known ideas are there - the guy that beats everyone and will solve anything, the guy that has all the fancy weapons, the lady who's also an agent and the all so previsible end - the agend and the girl on some paradise place while the ""boss"" is calling on some com device.",xXx
521,DonLasson,Terrible movie with even worse acting.,2,16 November 2005,"Except from a few impressive effects, nothing about this movie is good. The plot is oh so weak and even that weak plot is poorly executed. The script could very well be the dumbest, most cliché filled and all over worst script written. Unlike som flicks such as for example Tango & Cash the script isn't bad in a funny kind of way. It's just bad. Vin Diesel's performance is one the worst I've ever seen in a movie this big. Asia Argento puts in a decent performance and Samuel L Jackson does what you would expect him to do in a crappy movie like this, plays on routine. He has played that part so many times he could do it in his sleep. You can tell that none of the actors in this movie belived in it, and why should they? They did their job (poorly) cashed their checks, went home and never thought of this movie again. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. If you want to see a cool action flick, just re-watch Die Hard.",xXx
522,randiroosmom,The New 007,10,11 April 2005,"I loved this movie. It was packed with action and special effects. I like the character because not all hot heads are bad people. Samuel Jackson did not look his best, but I know that was for the part he was playing. Vin Diesel did a wonderful job and looks great. I had no idea he was so muscular. I don't know how Ice Cube can compete in the sequel. The avalanche scene was unbelievable. How did any one snowboarder not get caught by the snow. I think it had to be computer helped. No one could beat that speed. I think Vin Diesel should partner up with Lara Croft of Tombraider. They both shoot, drive, and live on the edge. Talk about adrenaline junkies!! I hope everyone enjoys the movie as much as I did and I noticed women seem to like it better. I wonder why. My boyfriend liked it just as much as I did.",xXx
523,iPoC,Not so bad at all,8,7 July 2005,"First of all, this is one of the better movies Vin Diesel has made. Agreed, Jackson acts like he's got something dead under his nose (actually next to his nose, but hey, you know the saying) But the action/effects are a James Bond/secret agent movie worthy. And I'm a sucker for music during the movie. Adrenaline and Feuer Frei both are perfectly mixed into the movie. Maybe the role of Jackson should have been played by someone else, someone else unknown like all those other actors that don't even have a picture on this site. What I like the most about this movie, is the concept. Criminal/adrenaline junkie gets second chance by posing as an undercover agent.",xXx
524,tylerjkuntz,Pointless... Yet entertaining,8,19 September 2020,"This movie is clearly an adrenaline filled joy ride in the imagination of an 8 year old kid mixed with the testosterone of Vin Diesel. All in all I really enjoy this film in a brainless action flick filled with loud noises, pointless explosions and non stop ego-driven action. I miss the way 90's films were filmed and this movie was able to capture that before technology changed the Hollywood scene. Sit back, don't think of anything and enjoy... It's the simple.",xXx
525,kash_ace,More than an Action movie,8,19 June 2005,"The film captures your attention from the outset, with one of the best openings I have ever seen. The film continues on the action theme with a hint of wit, humour and even a serious side. There is definitely some moral lessons to learn and reflections of real life politics in here too. However the breaks are applied about half way through and the film turns into your usual cool bad guy takes on the even badder bad guys where you can just switch off and enjoy some average action sequences.OVERALL I would say the first half of the film is quite classy and cool. The second half is you average action movie. MY ADVICE would be if you like VIN DIESEL or you like ACTION movies you will really enjoy this movie. Even if you are not one of the mentioned there is something about the movie which you draw you in.",xXx

I think you have just a little bit too much time on your hands there chachi.I personally loved this flick, a little unrealistic at times but hey, that's what movies are for! All I can say about it is it was one of the most fun movies I have seen in a long time. Great action, great concept, and Vin Diesel was perfect for this role. All round good time.Now go have a coke and a smile and relax, you probably hated the Matrix trilogy too I would bet. Another fabulous creation, take things fr what they are, instead of ripping it to shreds over a poo poo attitude.:)",xXx

I went out and rented it because it featured one of my favorite actors, Marton Csokas in a major role. I was definitely not disappointed. This movie is one of Marton's best roles. He plays a perfectly intense ""Yorgi"". And I thought he had an excellent accent for this role. Very cool! Besides being thrilled with Marton's performance, I found the action very entertaining. I loved this movie so much that I went out & bought it as soon as I returned my rental copy. Some of the technical government stuff gets a little boring, but for action & Marton fans it is more than well worth it! I would not recommend it for anyone who is offended by strong language, though as there's quite a bit.",xXx
