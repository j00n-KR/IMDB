0,Leofwine_draca,Half-baked sequel,4,22 June 2018,"THE CLOVERFIELD PARADOX is another half-baked sequel to the original found footage hit; it has very little to do with the Cloverfield mythos and instead comes across as a generic sci-fi/horror combo with an outer space setting. Once again we meet a crew of people aboard a spaceship who survive a catastrophe only to find themselves picked off one by one by a series of bizarre and deadly events. I do enjoy this sub-genre of filmmaking and there have been quite a few similar made recently, including ALIEN COVENANT and LIFE, but this is one of the weakest I've seen. The plotting is entirely predictable and the alternate reality scenario never really holds true. The only good things you can really say is that some of the special effects are pretty decent, and the film has amassed a fine international cast which includes Arksel Hennie, Ziyi Zhang and Daniel Bruhl.",The Cloverfield Paradox
1,SnoopyStyle,a space muddle,4,12 February 2018,"In the near future, the world is suffering from energy shortage. In an orbiting space station, a team of international scientists prepare to test a new energy system. At first, it works but something goes wrong.On its surface, I started to compare this to the recent space horror Life. It probably should have gone down that road. Instead, the strange events seem random and head-scratching. It's a muddle with no actual thrills. At a certain point, the premise could be surmised and yet I don't care. The international cast is admirable although the back and forth editing dilutes any possible chemistry. This movie had no chance.",The Cloverfield Paradox
2,claudio_carvalho,Could Have Been Better and Better,6,7 February 2018,"In the near future, there is an energy crisis on Earth. The Cloverfield Station with a multinational crew will test the Shepard particle accelerator expecting to generate energy for all countries solving the energy problem. However, the experiment goes wrong, damages the station and opens a portal to another dimension with a parallel Earth. They also find a woman entwined with wires behind a bulkhead of the station and they learn she worked in an identical Cloverfield Station in another dimension. Now the scientists need to find a way to return to their own dimension. ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" is a sci-fi-horror film with great cast and special effects. Unfortunately the story and the screenplay are not well-written and there are many flawed, annoying and senseless situations. Ava grieves the death of her children, but her attitude in the end is ridiculous. The oxygen generation is cut to provide energy to the Shepard particle generator and the supply is limited to forty and something minutes. However, Ava records a long and corny message to her double wasting important minutes. Schmidt is shot twice, but is capable to fight Jensen and to repair the Shepard. ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" could have been a great sci-fi with a better writer. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Paradoxo Cloverfield"" (""The Cloverfield Paradox"")",The Cloverfield Paradox
3,nogodnomasters,We're definately not in Kentucky anymore,7,12 February 2018,"The Earth is running out of energy and I am not sure what happened to renewable energy, but it is running out. It is decided that a particle accelerator in space is the answer to all of our problems. Now why space, I don't know. A crew, manages to get a few failed attempts and discover a ""paradox"" of two dimensions trying to combine as one. ""Cloverfield"" is the name of the space station and this may be some sort of prequel to the series...or not. Acting was okay. I didn't understand how they would harness and transmit the power from space to earth. The station apparently had science fiction unexplained movie gravity. Slow to develop but picked up.

4,kosmasp,"Going up, coming down",7,4 May 2018,"Obviously there are two other movies with the word ""cloverfield"" in the title. Especially the very first one was kept in secret back when it was released (10th year anniversay in 2018 by the way, so I guess not a coincidence to release the third one time wise). Right now many do know what it was about. If not do not spoil yourself by checking it out (it's more fun to discover what is happening while watching).More importantly: you don't have to have seen the other movies to enjoy them individually. They have their own stories. And while the Cloverfield lane movie might not be as surprising as the first one (I reckon you could see certain things coming, twist-wise), this kind of has more of surprising elements to it. If you do love Science Fiction movies in general (mixed with a bit of horror), you might give the movie a pass on some inconsistencies and logical issues and just enjoy this for what it is ...",The Cloverfield Paradox
5,Sleepin_Dragon,"Never mind that thing at the end, where was the plot!!",3,5 February 2018,"I don't like to slate films as a rule, but this was not good. The positives, the acting was ok, some nice special effects, and initially a good premise, the Earth disappearing, which in turn created some nice tension. The whole thing instantly fell apart due to the absence of any plot, I understand the whole Cloverfield premise, of nothing is supposed to make any sense until the whole thing is pieced together, but lazy writing does not make up for ambiguity. The trailers were brilliant, and instantly made me watch the film, just goes to show how powerful a trailer can be, and how bad the actual film is. The characters were presented in such a way that I had no empathy for any of them, on the whole they were unlikable. It's no wonder this went straight to Netflix.3/10",The Cloverfield Paradox
6,paul_haakonsen,"Should have been named ""The Paradox"". Why did they have ""Cloverfield"" thrown in there?...",3,8 June 2018,"I didn't even know that this movie had been made. So it was something of a surprise to find it on Netflix. And while I enjoyed the first two movies, of course I had to sit down and watch this 2018 addition to the franchise.However, it turned out that ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" was the least interesting of all the movies in the franchise so far, despite it having a very solid and talented ensemble of acting performers.It was the shallow and pointless storyline that was a drag for me, because it served absolutely no purpose and offered only such a diminutive narrative twist to the franchise. If anything, then it felt like a very unnecessary movie.Certain things in the movie just made little or no sense; such as why would there be a Chinese among the crew whom doesn't speak English and only two of the crew seemed to be able to speak Chinese, or something as important as how casual everyone was about their situation and how easily they shrugged off the hopelessness of the situation.Visually, then ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" was quite good.However, I was disappointed with the lack of further introduction to the strange monstrous visitors that found their way to Earth.This is not a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time around. And to be honest, then it felt like they made the movie and then slapped the ""Cloverfield"" brand on it afterwards. It didn't have that particular element from the previous two movies, not even in the slightest.",The Cloverfield Paradox
7,trashgang,not bad but why the name Cloverfield?,6,6 February 2018,"Part 3 in the Cloverfield franchise but what had part two to do with the first one, Cloverfield (2008) was pure enterntainment with monsters. 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) was for me a disaster. didn't liked it at all so this one should go back to the monsters.Somehow it does, this time we are out in space trying to safe the planet. And it did remind me a lot of Alien (1979) simply because something is out there on the ship. Sadly it isn't another Alien. Therefor some things doesn't worked out like Alien. There isn't really any suspense. But what do makes it good is that now and then the terror comes in and the effects are above mediocre. But again, it's only in the last seconds that the connection is made with the 2008 version. If you do like screaming in space then this is your thing but if you want to see a monster flick, forget it.

8,deloudelouvain,Still good enough for me,7,3 March 2018,"The Cloverfield Paradox might not be as good as the other Cloverfield movies, and some people might think this one has nothing to do with the others, but I thought the movie wasn't bad and it did have some connections with the other stories. If you had some unanswered questions in the previous movies you will get your answers with this movie. It all becomes clear at the end. The story itself was far from bad. Okay there are a lot of things that are just impossible, like their gravity and such, but it's just a movie so I don't pay much attention to those details because they're not really relevant to the story. The acting was also good so I don't know why you would ever concider criticizing that. In conclusion, the other Cloverfield movies were better, but this one is far from unwatchable like some reviewers pretend.",The Cloverfield Paradox
9,siderite,As Cloverfield as the other two :),7,6 February 2018,"If you know that Cloverfield and 10 Cloverfield Lane had very little to do with each other you will not be surprised that The Cloverfield Paradox has no real connection to them, either. A combination of a lighter Event Horizon and the National Geographic series Mars, it tells the story of the crew of a space station constructed to test an experimental reactor. Of course, as it happens in movies, the effects of the reactor are very different from what it was designed for.There are a lot of people who did not like the film. I can understand why, but I can't say this is a bad movie. It has good acting, good special effects, more science than most action movies and just a few glaring errors. Would it have been better to not start things with a global energy crisis? Yes. We know that if you can make a huge space station orbiting the Earth you have enough solar to meet any needs. Would it have been better to skip some of the more dramatic, but senseless points of the film, like the worms and the hand thing? Yes, but then the movie would have been a bit boring. Would it have been better to call it something else and skip the creature bit at the end completely? Clearly so, but then it wouldn't be ""part of a franchise"".Bottom line: I liked the film. It was entertaining. I also had very few expectations. Probably that is what you need to enjoy the experience.",The Cloverfield Paradox
10,thesar-2,Lose This Footage,2,7 February 2018,"Dude, I just came back from a Sci-Fi convention...and boy do I have 16 ideas for 1 movie!The Cloverfield Paradox, or the third film/prequel in the groundbreaking (in terms of actual grounds breaking in part 1) series is a kaleidoscope of so many movies I don't think I could list them all in the spot I'm allotted. But, I'll try.Life. Event Horizon. Alien. Alien vs. Predator. The Black Hole. Sunshine. Star Trek. Sphere. Armageddon. Interstellar. The Core. Just to name a few. But, funny enough, it doesn't mimic the original Cloverfield or its semi-sequel, 10 Cloverfield Lane, in the slightest. It's so far off from them, it might have well introduced the Wizard of Oz and blame him for bringing giant creatures into a found footage universe. Originally, as this movie started, I wanted to headline this review as ""Uneventful Horizon"" as nothing was happening. But, then so many subplots and mystical things happened, my mind was blown with how much they tried to cram in here and it got tiring, very fast.Basically, and oddly, the world's running out of energy. I assume this is far into the future (even though this is a prequel!) as everything seems normal. But, regardless, supposedly, the world's low on juice. So, the stereotypical multicultural experts are sent into space to create the ultimate battery. Then, the story literally tells you where this is going: they're gonna cross-dimensions and things are gonna get weird.Weird they do get. So, kudos for keeping your promise. Only, so many weird things happen, it gets tedious as it might as well be a ghost ship in space where there are no rules, no boundaries and no reality to help us feel dread or fear. I am NOT a fan of found footage, but I make a rare exception every once in a while. I loved The Blair Witch Project and I adored the original Cloverfield. Then, the sorta-sequel came out: 10 Cloverfield Lane and I loved it - mostly from the originality, ending and JOHN FREAKING GOODMAN. He had my nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Didn't happen, but oh well. No one listens to me anyways...And then there's this piece of shit. Or, the WTF entry. Didn't explain hardly anything, was mostly pieces of much better sci-fi movies and there never was a reason to explain the beasts that originally attacked NYC. Let them be like huge Michael Myers. Just let them be and not Prometheus the crap out of the mystery of part 1.Totally avoid this. Sure, they put money into this. Absolutely the acting is real. But the story is solidly stupid, the fact this is part of a much better universe but dumbed down and it really fits nowhere in what made part one stand out. I really wish they expanded on 10 Cloverfield Lane's excellent ending and not go back to make little sense of the whole picture. Pass!***Final thoughts: After all I said above, one of my biggest gripes was how little they tied this into the series. Every once in a blue moon they'd jet us back to Earth with a shaky cam of explosions and ""what's going on here?!"" worries. Those few seconds I cherished and wanted to know more about. Sadly, they kept shifting us back into space where the bulk of the boring movie took place.",The Cloverfield Paradox
11,FeastMode,my notes,6,26 July 2019,"This movie is well made in a lot of ways. it has a great cast with a beastly performance by gugu. it was suspenseful and crazy. lots of cool parts and things i've never seen before. cool sci-fi aspects. it also has some questionable moments, and i think it's filled with scientific inaccuracies. but if you turn your brain off you can have a good time. entertainment-wise it was almost a 3.5 but i couldn't go that high with some of it's flaws. especially the fact that it also had a side story that was pretty much useless and brought down the pacing while unnecessarily extending the run time (1 viewing)",The Cloverfield Paradox
12,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Absolute nonsense.,5,23 October 2019,"'The Cloverfield Paradox (2018)' is absolute nonsense. Even within its own internal, 'because-we-said-so' logic, a lot of it just doesn't make sense. It's actually laughable, at times. The piece is stuck between a rock and a hard place; a mediocre sci-fi forced to become a mediocre spin-off. Its attempts to tie in to the wider franchise are laboured, at best. The story only suffers from this. It actually feels false, a corporate decision rather than a natural narrative. The elements which are most likely its own aren't particularly good, though. It tells its tale primarily with exposition, having overt explanations for even the simplest of stuff. The dialogue usually doubles up with the visuals, as opposed to complimenting them. Aside from a few meagre attempts at comedy, the movie treats its absurdism with an absolutely straight-face, too. It's not terrible, however. There are moments of tension and some decent body-horror. It's engaging enough, but it's certainly not good. The plot has potential but, as it is, it just seems so basic, based on the most clichéd of clichés. It is enjoyable at times, to be honest. Once you start thinking about it, though, it all falls apart. The whole thing seems slightly amateur, despite a cracking cast. It's almost a paradox in itself. 5/10",The Cloverfield Paradox
13,bowmanblue,Only just 'Cloverfield',7,19 February 2018,"It seemed that the majority of movie-goers enjoyed the first 'Cloverfield' film where an alien the size of Godzilla rampages its way through New York (even if most of us didn't quite understand why the film was called 'Cloverfield' in the first place. Then came it's 'sequel' (notice the use of quote marks there?) which used the 'Cloverfield' name in its title and yet bore little similarities to the original. Now, we have 'The Cloverfield Paradox.' I guess that at least this time I didn't expect it to instantly tie in to either of the previous two - and I was kind of right.'Part III' seems to be a pretty generic horror movie set in space with a couple of scenes thrown in there which sort of pull it into the 'shared universe' that's apparently being created. It feels a lot more like 'Alien' or 'Event Horizon' where the crew of a space station orbiting Earth suddenly find themselves teleported to the other side of the sun, wondering how they got there and what the mysterious happenings are on board.It's worth noting that this film has been released straight to Netflix, which is becoming the new way we used to say 'straight to video/DVD.' It's budget is acceptable and the sets are reasonably space age, until you have things that happen involving severed limbs which can move on their own. Then I started raising an eyebrow at the blatant use of CGI. The 'strange happenings' on board soon start becoming fatal and our cast begin to drop one by one, leaving it feeling more like an old-school 'slasher' film set in space. It does its best to try and make up for this by being a little more scientific than your average 'monster movie in space' and for that, it does succeeed.There are those films where you can easily check your phone or pop out for a cup of tea. Probably not best to do that here, as it won't just be a case as you've missed a crew-member's demise, but the story has skipped settings (I won't go into detail about what I mean by 'settings' as I don't want to give away too much!) and you'll actually miss a vital plot point.Now, it may just be my love of the 'IT Crowd,' but - for me - the stand-out performance went to Chris O'Dowd, who possibly relied on his ability for humour to own every scene he was in. The rest of the cast are also functional for what they're used for, but you probably won't really remember any of the characters; names (I even just referred to Chris O'Dowd's engineer-character as 'Roy!').If you have Netflix and are generally a fan of sci-fi and/or horror then this is a decent enough little film to while away an hour and a half. However, don't look at it as much to do with the first two films - see the 'Cloverfield' films as more of a sci-fi anthology than a continuous series. This is one sequel where you really don't need to have watched anything that came before it to really understand what's going on (okay, maybe apart from the very last shot of the movie!).",The Cloverfield Paradox
14,ThomasDrufke,A Valiant Attempt,6,11 February 2018,"I waited almost an entire week to write this review, mostly because there was so much controversy and negativity surrounding this film that I felt it would be more efficient to wait until the dust settled to express my thoughts. I loved the first two Cloverfield universe films, I own both on blu-ray and was fascinated by each respected marketing campaigns (or in 10 Cloverfield Lane's case: lack thereof). The Cloverfield Paradox had little to none marketing, in fact it released its trailer and film on the same day. And I had my trepidations before watching 'Paradox'. For one, I heard it was originally an entirely different film, JJ then came in and switched a good chunk of the film up to make it fit in with the Cloverfield Universe, and even changed the title to fit the continuity. It's not an outrageously unheard of thing to do in this day of every studio needing multiple franchises and excessive links to other films. With that said, I was still confident that we would get a new Cloverfield treat in stores for us right after the big game.What we got is somewhere in-between all the mess mentioned above. On one hand, you have a very well-acted and shot film that very well could have been released on the big screen. But on second thought, there's the problematic fact that this film seems to complicate the mythos of Cloverfield more so than it does expand the fascinating lore. I'm not the guy swarming the reddit pages and pointed out all of the hidden gems in these films, but I never felt like this movie needed to be tied into the others in the first place. And I guess the same could be said for 10 Cloverfield Lane, so I could be just contradicting my previous points. But I guess the few moments that this film does tie in (ending & news clips) almost feel like they take away from the quality whereas the elements that tied in with 'Lane' enhanced it.Nevertheless, I was entertained by ""The Cloverfield Paradox"". It does feel like a lot of films we have seen before i.e. last year's 'Life', but I'll always be partial to science fiction films that attempt to (even if they don't succeed) add another layer to this filmmaking genre.6.2/10",The Cloverfield Paradox
15,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,5,12 February 2018,"The Cloverfield ParadoxThe worst thing about life on an international space station is that Russian and American astronauts always collude to rig movie night voting.Sadly, the crew in this thriller won't live long enough to complain about this week's selection.While in the throes of an energy crisis, Earth launches representatives from around the world (David Oyelowo, Daniel Brühl, Chris O'Dowd, Gugu Mbatha-Raw), along with a particle accelerator that will tap into alternative energy sources, into space. But when the accelerator opens a portal to an alternate reality, a bevy of behemoths are unleashed on Earth. The third installment in the cryptic Cloverfield franchise, this Netflix distributed sequel sheds some light on the origins of the monsters plaguing our planet, but its slapdash and incongruous script simply feels shoehorned into the larger narrative.And while giant monsters don't necessarily ease our energy crisis, their carcasses will help with global food shortages.

16,westsideschl,Bad Science (Movie or Not),2,19 February 2019,"1. ""World's energy resources fully exhausted within five years."" Sorry, not going to happen that quickly. One, amongst many reasons, taking just oil & natural gas as an example, is that it will still be recoverable for a very long time, but at greater expense as easier sources are used up.
2. Space station as usual is unrealistically over structured with heavy metals and extraneous everything else. It's just too overwhelmingly costly to send that stuff up there.
3. A particle accelerator in space - if you saw the size of the one's on Earth then that idea is just laughable. And, that it would produce free energy is never going to happen. It takes energy to build, maintain & somehow transport to Earth & infrastructure to move it about.
4. Cheap special effects of shaking, noisy, flashing lights space station during particle accelerator use - dumb! Lots of dramatic music, sound effects to hide poor storytelling.
5. More of the sci-fi writer's reuse of dumbing down of viewers by saying the usual ""ripping open the membrane of space-time; smashing together multiple dimensions, shattering reality."" ""Unleash monsters, demons, beast from the sea."" These grade school metaphors & outcomes show no understanding of the subject. Creative writing makes people more intelligent while providing fantasy.

17,851222,Not bad science-fiction movie,7,10 February 2019,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Cloverfield Paradox"" (2018) isn't the best movie in this trilogy, but its not bad movie on its own. I liked all the sci-fi ""mumbo jumbo"" stuff. Acting was not bad, story is descent for a science-fiction movie, but script at some points was simply laughable and hilarious. Like all the stuff with a hand (no spoilers) - it was funny, but probably not in a way creators intended to be. And there some cringe dialog as well. But other then that, this movie is pretty descent.Overall, ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" is not a great movie, but it did its job on a boring evening for me - a science-fiction fan.

The cast do a great job including the always excellent Chris O'Dowd and the movie has an element of mystery that kept me interested.How are the three movies connected? I wondered, surely they must be right?Well after watching the film, having a good think and even googling fan theories I can confidently say I mostly get it but simply don't like it. It is far easier to connect 1 & 3 than 2 & 3, someone might have to explain that to me in a bit more depth.I understand that the movie is science fiction but Paradox has too much pseudo science for me and left too many things unexplained and I'm not even talking the connection stuff.I don't think this is a bad film I just think that the three Cloverfield movies are broken jigsaw pieces that the creators are trying to awkwardly force together and it just isn't working.I'd like to see one more, one final Cloverfield movie that competently explains everything.

19,The-Sarkologist,Sort of Gives us Answers,5,6 January 2019,"After being surprised by 10 Cloverfield Lane, when I heard that this film had been released a part of me wanted to get around to watching it. Unfortunately, it is one of those Netflix only releases, which means that if you want to watch it then you basically have to subscribe to Netflix. Well, that eventually happened, because, well, things like that eventually happen, so, eventually, I was able to watch it.
The question that is raised is whether this film actually answers the questions that were left hanging in the previous movies. Well, sort of, but sort of not. In a way, it might actually be better to just leave these films as being stand alone films as opposed to actually trying to find a connection with each of them. The thing is that if you have seen the previous films, then there does seem to be a bit of a disconnect between the first and the second films, and this film. Still, that doesn't stop people from speculating about the connections.This film is set on a space station where they are attempting to fire up a particle accelerator so as to deal with the world's energy crisis. However, there are some warnings that such an experiment could have the potential of ripping a hole in the fabric of reality. Ironically, this is rather similar to the concerns over the investigation into the Higg-Boson, or God, particle. Well, we are all still here so I guess that pretty much amounted to nothing.That isn't the case in this film though because, well, it turns out that after they fire up the accelerator, Earth suddenly disappears, and a whole heap of weird stuff starts happening to the station. Honestly, this part did have some suspense, and I could tell it was going to be one of those films were the main characters are basically killed off one by one, but the problem was that it really didn't quite know what was going on - was the space station simply malfunctioning, or was reality being bent in some rather unsual ways - and how on Earth did that woman land up in the maintenance hatch, especially since their space station was on the other side of the sun at the time.Yeah, I guess that was one of the issues with this film, and that is that there were a number of things that didn't make sense. Sure, the suggestion is that reality had been warped, but I'm not entirely sure if they really knew to what extent this was going to be the case. In part, it felt as if the writers had simply thrown a whole heap of stuff together but gave no thought as to any logic behind it.
Mind you, they also had cut scenes to Earth, where the protagonist's husband was trying to deal with the changed conditions there. The thing is that you weren't actually all that sure as to what was going on. That, I thought, was quite a good part of the film, and one of the more consistent aspects to it. Sure, there were suggestions at the beginning as to what might happen, and this suggestion sort of explains where the monster in the first film came from, but in part the film does tease us with what is going on on Earth in the here and now. In a way, they show us cut scenes, but it doesn't actually connect until that final scene.This film actually wasn't too bad. There were some good things about it and some bad things about it. Sure, it wasn't original. In fact I couldn't help but think that there were elements of Event Horizon in it. Then again, I probably shouldn't be all that surprised that such films would borrow from other films - Shakespeare did. However, since it is one of those straight to DVD movies (though, of course, we don't have such films any more), I wouldn't expect all that much to come from it.",The Cloverfield Paradox
20,tomgillespie2002,"If this was released in cinemas, I'd be asking for my money back",2,17 February 2018,"If by some miracle Julius Onah's The Cloverfield Paradox is remembered in the years to come, it won't be for its qualities as a sci-fi actioner or its position in the intriguing and mysterious Cloverfield franchise, but for its rather ingenious marketing campaign. Audiences were aware of its existence under the name God Particle, but like the previous two entries in J.J. Abrams' monster series, everything about the movie was kept under wraps. Cue the Superbowl, where production studios clamber to show their latest trailers to the largest audience in the U.S., and the film, now under the name of The Cloverfield Paradox was finally unveiled. Much to everybody's surprise, they wouldn't have to wait several months to see it in the cinemas, but it would be available to stream on Netflix straight after the game. Now, you don't even need to leave the house to see the latest blockbuster in all its glory, but could watch it in your pants while intoxicated, with Doritos crumbs dotted down your front.As I stated earlier, this was an ingenious move, but only on one side of the deal: Abrams and Paramount. Obviously sensing an utter stinker, they managed to flog this tarted-up straight-to-DVD effort to Netflix for more than $50 million. It started strongly, but the viewing figures started to die away as audiences sobered up. Hampered with a horrible, TV-level script, a willingness to steal from far better films, and a central mystery that gets explained to us before the story has even kicked in, The Cloverfield Paradox is barely a movie but a string of cliches played out by an enormously talented cast, which includes the likes of Gugu Mbatha-Raw, David Oyelowo, Daniel Bruhl, Zhang Ziyi, John Ortiz, Aksel Hennie and annoying comic relief Chris O'Dowd, all of whose eyes look oddly glazed over. If I had paid £9 or whatever ridiculous price the cinema is these days, I would be asking for my money back. Luckily I have Netflix, so I get to watch this crap for a small monthly payment. Set in 2028, the Earth is experiencing a global energy crisis and the crew aboard the orbiting Cloverfield Space Station are humanity's only hope. They aim to unleash the Shepard particle accelerator, which will generate infinite energy and save our species. Some, however, believe this will open up parallel universes and alternate dimensions, allowing demons and monsters into our world, tearing a hole in reality as we know it. When things start to get freaky, we know precisely what has happened, so are forced to suffer being two steps ahead of the crew for the remainder of the film. Things liven up slightly when a mysterious passenger winds up on board, played by the radiant Elizabeth Debicki, but by this time I was tired of seeing all my predictions come true. The Cloverfield Paradox feels like a forgotten straight-to-DVD relic from the early 2000s, dusted off and re-edited to loosely tie in with Cloverfield franchise. How they convinced Netflix to cough up $50 million is beyond me. Abrams should have done the decent thing and spared us of this nonsense altogether.",The Cloverfield Paradox

They are trying their best in order for the device to work and save as many lives as they can, but everything changes when for the first time works and an unpredictable result comes out.I have to admit that I expected more from this movie because I believe that it had the potential of being a better movie. I liked the plot of it and it had also some great scenes with much action and suspense but except for this, it wasn't something remarkable or something that I haven't watched before in a movie. I didn't like the direction which was made by Julius Onah because it lacked imagination and made a lot of expositions during the movie. I liked the interpretation of Daniel Brühl who played as Schmidt and he was very good but not enough to save this movie. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Gugu Mbatha-Raw's who played as Hamilton and Chris O'Dowd's who played as Mundy and he gave a different touch in the movie.Finally, I have to say that ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" isn't a bad movie just another average movie with a great potential that wasn't reached. It has an interesting plot and some good interpretations but nothing more. If you want to watch it just don't have high expectations from it and I am sure that you are going to enjoy it, otherwise, you are going to be disappointed by it.",The Cloverfield Paradox
22,cruise01,Could have been better but turns out to be the weakest cloverfield yet.,5,7 February 2018,"Cloverfield Paradox is the third entry in the Cloverfield series. They are starting to become J.J. Abrams mystery twilight zone films. The plots are usually kept a mystery; the villains or monsters are slowly revealed. I enjoyed the first Cloverfield even though the found footage was dizzying but entertaining to see the concept mixed with a giant monster coming from the sea. 10 Cloverfield Lane was the best one yet and had an exciting surprise and twist. The Cloverfield Paradox however feels like an unnecessary film. This time taking place in a space station were astronauts try to use a particle accelerator to find a solution for the energy crisis. What I liked about the film is it started out good in terms to plot and concept. The plot dealt with Earth resources are diminishing. The energy crisis is the focus. A group of astronauts in a space station use a particle accelerator to find a lasting energy solution. When doing so, the earth disappears. With no contact from home, the ship misbehaving with the power, and a stranger they find within the station. They have to solve the mystery of there missing home before danger finds them. The plot had a great build up with the mystery concept. But the direction Julius Onah and writer Oren Uziel spends most of the film with having these characters trying to figure out a way to get the particle accelerator back on to reverse the process. Now, there was nothing fresh with the idea and the original story of going through another dimension seemed to be a waste of time. It introduces an interesting concept but waste majority of the screen time with characters debating about using their device to go back home. Sure, the tone started out like the film Life or The Thing. But it falls flat when nothing is going on throughout the movie. I liked the cast ensemble. Daniel Bruhl playing a German astrophysicist. Elizabeth Debicki was an interesting character without giving away spoilers. Gugu Mbatha-Raw was the highlight of the cast with her beautiful emotional character depth. Chris O'Dowd was okay and tried to be the comic relief but was not as funny. Zhang Ziyi playing Bruhls characters girlfriend. John Ortiz was decent. And David Oyelowo was okay as well.What I did not like about the film, which I listed partially with the plot above. Had an interesting mystery start. But falls flat with a boring direction. I was hoping for an unpredictable twist half way but was left with nothing. Characters get stuck and stranded in the space station. And they spend most of it arguing and debating about getting the accelerator back on and going back home. The direction and suspense was dull and boring for a science fiction horror movie. There are some weird scenes that try to throw the movie in a direction that characters are caught off guard with the laws of physics and the environment they are in. Meanwhile on Earth, Gugu Mbatha-Raw's characters husband is witnessing a global attack. Overall, The Cloverfield Paradox is a not so good film. I liked the cast. The concept could have turned out better. But falls in a boring direction were the characters are not as interesting and the suspense and thrills are not there. Basically, nothing happens most of the movie. Which is disappointing compared to the other two movies. Hoping the next film turns things around. Also, the final minute of the film was the most spine chilling moment you will ever get from this film. I rate the film 2.5 out of 5 stars. I would not recommend this film unless you are very bored. By all means, even though this installment really was unnecessary nor did it add anything new.",The Cloverfield Paradox
23,zkonedog,The First Bad Robot Film That Isn't Completely Realized,5,11 February 2018,"As a big fan of projects coming out of J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot studios, one thing that always impresses me about them is how fully realized they are. The plots or subject matter may not be for everyone, but each film has a real sense of knowing exactly what it is and wants to be. They are very tight, with nary a wasted scene, and usually feature very interesting, well-developed characters. For the first time that I can think of, however, ""Cloverfield Paradox"" fails on most of those levels.For a basic plot summary, this film focuses on Hamilton (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), an astronaut on a mission captained by Kiel (David Oyelowo). The mission's purpose is to test out the Shepard particle accelerator, which promises to open an unlimited supply of energy to an Earth running out of that commodity. While testing the device, however, Kiel and his crew inadvertently rip open the very fabric of space-time itself. This unleashes some unusual horrors about the crew of the ship and down on the Earth itself, where Hamilton's husband is struggling to survive a momentous event.To get right down to it, the biggest problem with ""Paradox"" is that it truly is all over the place in terms of plot and character development. There are so many things happening, and so many characters, that anything that should be important to the story just gets ""lost in the shuffle"". As a result, the film ends up feeling like it really isn't ""about"" anything; rather just a generic space station adventure (of which many of that ilk have been made, and some much better than this). Clearly, Bad Robot and director Julius Onah were not able to capture the same ""lightning in a bottle"" that happened with ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" a couple of years ago.Now, ""Paradox"" is not a terrible movie by any stretch (probably not deserving the absolutely atrocious ratings it's pulling in throughout the web). A lot of the visual concepts are interesting/chilling, and I believe the opportunity really did exist to make this a great ""Cloverfield prequel"", of sorts. While watching, I could see what was being chased after with this picture.Sadly, ""Cloverfield Paradox"" just never puts it all together in the end. It is a mashup of some new ideas, some old space station movie tropes, and a pinch of Cloverfield universe-building thrown in for good measure. I know that this film suffered from budget issues and poor test screenings (likely why it was premiered on Netflix instead of in theaters), and also did not have the benefit (I have heard) of Mr. Abrams giving it the once-over in post production (writing the script for Star Wars Episode IX will do that). Perhaps that lack of cohesion contributed to the film's similar lack of connective tissue all the way through.I will continue to look forward to Bad Robot products in the future, as they are a quality production company always on the lookout for interesting concepts/ideas, but ""Paradox"" can probably be considered their first ""dud"". The fact that I can still give it 5/10 stars, however, speaks to how much respect I still have for some of the ideas/shots in the film. It was never boring...just too wayward to consist of any substance in the end.",The Cloverfield Paradox
24,eddie_baggins,A Netflix lemon,3,6 February 2018,"Not often do you get to watch a trailer and the movie on the very same day but that's exactly what happened when Netflix unleashed their high-profile Superbowl trailer for their newly purchased Cloverfield project once known as God Particle on the world this week.Sending fans of the J.J Abrams backed series into a frenzy and coaxing more casual moviegoers into having a watch after the big showdown, Netflix's plan to create buzz out of thin air has certainly worked but behind the mastermind tactics lies a dark and somewhat sad secret behind the reasoning of this clandestine campaign.Once touted as a large-scale cinema release through the Paramount brand, what we now know to be The Cloverfield Paradox was snapped up by Netflix in the 12th hour to become the streaming giants newest name brand release but it's quite possible upon purchase that Netflix grew to understand they had nabbed a lemon and decided that the usual release plan for first time director Julius Onah unexciting and uninspired feature wasn't going to cut it.From what seems to be a genuinely decent starting off point for a movie that could melt minds and provide some thrills and chills, Paradox quickly descends into a generic space disaster film filled with random and unexplained occurrences and a crew of supposedly bright minds that we don't even get a chance to care about, giving Onah's film little chance of succeeding as either another solid Cloverfield recognised product or an above average sci-fi/horror experience.With any film that delves into such highly doubtful scenarios such as parallel dimensions, monsters or Chris O'Dowd as a repairman, the suspension of disbelief and logic gets given a long string by the audience but Onah takes us all for a ride as his film plummets along from its intriguing beginning through to a ""are you serious"" finale, that includes a wannabe money shot final scene that just doesn't work.As Onah ship continues to sink further and further into the cold and unforgiving waters of the unfortunately daft, a recognisable if not exactly name brand cast can't help elevate proceedings and while lead actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw continues to be a solid contributor to all of her projects, other actors that should know better like Daniel Bruhl and John Ortiz fail to make an impact while the aforementioned O'Dowd in particular is horrible in his supposed comic relief like role.Final Say - Both an extremely disappointing entry into the Cloverfield series and an unworthily hyped Netflix product, The Cloverfield Paradox will make all who view it dubious on future Netflix products that follow a similar release path, with fears they too are but clever ways to unleash a lemon on the unsuspecting public.1 ½ severed writing arms out of 5",The Cloverfield Paradox
25,TheMovieDiorama,The Cloverfield Paradox strings together illogical scenarios to create a galactic mess.,3,19 July 2018,"Possibly employing the best marketing technique ever, announcing and releasing the film on the very same day to everyone's surprise, my excitement naturally exceeded my expectation. But then I read it: ""no cinematic release"". Immediately, I quivered in fear. Did the producers wander if this sci-fi thriller was not good enough for a theatrical release? They must've done, because guess what? It's. An. Absolute. Disaster. A group of astronauts attempt to solve Earth's energy crisis by using a particle accelerator on their space station, only to find themselves teleported to an alternate parallel dimension. My dissatisfaction for this tangled paradoxical mess knows no bounds. No suspense. No thrills. No engaging characters. Nothing. Aside from the pleasing visual effects, Mbatha-Raw's performance and the presence of Zhang Ziyi, who still remains underappreciated to this very day, the struggle to find enjoyment in this was real. Writer Uziel seemingly takes the sci-fi genre and decides to test the boundaries of illogicality. Never mix complication with fallaciousness. This results in the vast majority of the screenplay consisting of explanations in an attempt to form some sense of scientific reasoning, leaving no space for character development. In actual fact, these explanations are powered by various plot conveniences that still make no sense. The characters can shout out terms like ""quantum entanglement"" to explain the merging of dimensions, but the lack of conviction results in stupidity. The boring plot, pointless sub-plot and wooden characters are so thinly written that the air in space is thicker (hint: there is no air in space). O'Dowd's comedic relief was not wanted. Ortiz deserved more screentime. Ziyi decimated the competition. JJ Abrams should be embarrassed with this. I want 102 minutes back. Lazy, just stupendously lazy. This simply exists as a tenuous link to the 'Cloverfield' franchise. Except, the mystery has now been tainted. A colossal dimensional disappointment.",The Cloverfield Paradox
26,Tweetienator,Next Stage: Braindead,3,6 February 2018,"After watching The Cloverfield Paradox I am not sure how and if that movie is related somehow to Cloverfield and 10 Cloverfield Lane.Anyway, the Fx and setting is good, the acting okay, BUT the story is a terrible mess. Really not one of the bad bad, that somehow are so bad they are reborn good again (like certain notorious B and C movies of the horror genre), no, the story of this movie is just BAD.We get mixed dimensions, a wandering and intelligent hand like in Evil Dead, crew members attacked by walls and tools, and yes, somehow the energy crisis and human technology is involved. I am sure one of the film makers could explain to me how the other two ""Cloverfields"" are related, I suspect that the crew was somehow responsible of opening some dimension gates on Earth (if those movies are related somehow), so we get a prequel etc. but I am not interested in any explanation. I want to forget. Fast.For me again a pro cast and a pro setting and production team is wasted on a BAD story. Maybe it is time to shoot all living script writers so we get a new generation of them who maybe will work with more caution on the plot and logic, because they know of the destiny of their predecessors ;)Other theories regarding the High Level of Immense Dumbness in the Storyline:a) some production dudes having certain substances and making fun and trying to figure out how much dumbness they can still sell to the audience and can get away with it,b) the quality in education after the last decades has produced enough dumb people so of course dumb people now get a job as writers,c) I am getting old and I don't understand the world of today anymore and simply this stuff is so different and incomprehensible to the good old ways of my neuron's thinking that I simply cannot understand the superbness and complexities of The Cloverfiled Paradox and the like.Well, I will ponder on this issue, and if necessary, I will shoot myself ;)",The Cloverfield Paradox
27,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""Cloverfield"" name loses a lot of its mystery and intrigue with this predictable space-station thriller",4,5 February 2018,"Netflix's huge swoop up and surprise Super Bowl release of the newest film in the ""Cloverfield"" film universe should prove to be a daring stroke of movie-distributing genius-if for no other reason than it should help generate big ratings for a film that would've otherwise been killed by bad word of mouth.Initially called ""God Particle,"" the film was adopted by J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot into the ""Cloverfield"" family mostly after the fact, but its connection to the ambiguous mythology of cinema's most secretive franchise doesn't do anything to elevate this predictable ""diverse crew in a space station"" thriller.Oren Uziel (""22 Jump Street"") and Doug Jung's (""Star Trek Beyond"") story imagines an energy-depleted world in desperately depending on the success of a particle accelerator experiment on board a station manned by scientists and engineers from various nations. Uziel's script launches quickly into the experiment, providing only a personal look into Hamilton's (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) life before frustrations, tension and unnatural occurrences rise.After Dan Trachtenberg's pulse-pounding claustrophobic 2016 thriller ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" married a smaller chamber piece with a sci-fi disaster flick, it felt safe to hope director Julius Onah might do the same with an ""Alien""-inspired space opera. The pieces are in place, but ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" quickly devolves into a carbon copy of the many space-station films before it, wasting a juicy cast including Mbatha-Raw, David Oyelowo, Daniel Bruhl, Elizabeth Debicki, Chris O'Dowd and others.For one, the script shoehorns in too much exposition to cue the viewer into what's going on rather than keeping it a mystery, and in the end there's not much mystery to be revealed except for whether the mission will succeed. In the meantime, creepy stuff begins happening to members of the crew in a series of familiar, contrived on-board disasters that result in character deaths, betrayals and the usual outer-space plot devices.Many concepts in the film hold promise, but the execution in the writing and direction fails them in every way. From the ""explanation"" to what's going on to some character debacles to the way the film connects to ""Cloverfield,"" there are potentially intriguing ideas at play that would've provided the film with just enough food for thought to separate it from the rest of this sub-genre. Instead, they get as woefully undercooked as the characters, leaving ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" with no option but to try to work as a space station survival story and pretend as if we haven't seen it all before. Fans of the ""Cloverfield"" films will probably find some joy in the more explicit connections and explanations ""Paradox"" offers, but some of those fans will also likely be incensed at just how the mystery is unfolding and the technical nuts and bolts of it. The previous two films were microcosms and smaller stories-in ""Paradox,"" humanity's survival is wrapped up in a very public, high profile space mission. Instead of teasing us with mysteries, ""Paradox"" paints more of a picture of what this franchise is about and it does so carelessly.Sadly, rather than light a fire under the franchise and increase our appetite for more from this anthology, ""Paradox"" sucks some of the clout and intrigue out from it. Instead of seeing the name ""Cloverfield"" and thinking ""mysteries and secrets,"" after watching ""Paradox,"" audiences are more likely to associate it with ""gimmick.""~Steven CThanks for reading!

29,southdavid,"""Logic Doesn't Apply To Any Of This""",4,9 February 2018,"Retrofitting an unmade script to fit into an existing franchise is a risky proposition, for every ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" there's a ""Speed 2 - Cruise Control"". . Similarly, for every ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" there's a ""The Cloverfield Paradox"". The surprise release definitely worked to generate a lot of interest in the film, and I'm sure that, like ""Bright"" before it, viewing figures will be very good. But also as ""Bright"" was able to bypass traditional criticism and head straight to the audience was probably one of the key reasons that Paramount went for this release strategy. In case you haven't got me yet, ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" is not good. The film is not an unmitigated disaster, by any means. It looks great and the cast is top notch. It occasionally manages to get the tension or humour it's after, in some of the scenes and, if you must give an explanation for the events in the original ""Cloverfield"" film, the one this provides is as good as any. The problems with the film all stem from the fact that I don't believe, and in some cases, understand the internal logic of the story. I'm fine with the premise of a multiverse and with the idea that an experiment can cause issues with Space/Time leading to different parts of the ""Cloverfield"" story happening at different times and in different universes. But none of those concepts excuse the choppy and confused plot holes. A couple of examples of what I am talking about. There will be spoilers from here on out. The action on board the Spacestation feels like, and the news articles seem to confirm this, they were attempting to salvage something from a film that was a bit of a mess. At times, the film feels like it is attempting to be an ""Event Horizon"" style horror film. There are several scenes early on that hint as a malevolent force at work, which don't lead anywhere.  Pretty much as soon as soon as the ship has leaped into the new Universe, the Russian character Volkov begins to act possessed, pulling on the skin on his face and engaging in mirror conversations with unseen voices. He then goes and creates a gun on the 3d printer and threatens the rest of the crew. We later learn that his problem is that during the dimension leap, the ships collection of scientific worms has been transported inside his body. That's a cool idea, and makes for a great visual when then explode out of him, but none of that explains talking to the mirror and attacking his crew mates. (He ends up having a large piece of the ships machinery inside his body too, despite that clearly not being the case in previous scenes. Another example is the demise of Mundy, this is linked to a throwaway line in the movie that I feel like the writers/editors felt explains more than it does. We're told that the physics in these alternative universes works differently. This (sort of) helps explain why the magnetism, in a particular room, changes on Mundy. This leads to one of the films best visuals, as some sealant (of all things) creepily forms a lethal stalactite behind him. However, the film cuts away, then back to him and somehow rather than impaled, he's been dragged back to the wall and is being strangled. There are dozens of examples like this; scenes and moments that don't stand up the even the slightest amount of scrutiny.The earthbound scenes, in which Michael starts to drive to the hospital before finding and saving a small girl are intriguing whilst they are happening, but also end up coming to naught. He drives somewhere, sort of sees a Cloverfield monster and then hides in a fallout shelter. They are clearly pasted into the story to try and tie the film to the franchise a bit more, but really add little to the narrative. I am, if I am honest with myself, still excited to see what comes next in The ""Cloverfield"" series, despite the disappointment of this film and am looking forward to four and five. Hopefully this proves to be the franchise's nadir.",The Cloverfield Paradox

31,jtindahouse,Great ending saves an otherwise forgettable film,7,6 February 2018,"I remember going into the theatre to see '10 Cloverfield Lane' with absolutely no idea of what it was about or what to expect and then proceeding to be blown away by how good it was. That movie seemed to come out of absolutely nowhere, but not nearly to the extent 'The Cloverfield Paradox' did. From what I understand there was a trailer during the Super Bowl announcing it would start playing on Netflix once the game was finished. I mean that's unprecedented. So was it as good as the first sequel? Not quite.The first thing you'l notice is that there is not a white American man anywhere in sight in this movie. That is incredibly rare. It can leave you feeling a little lost as to a character to relate to at times though. Secondly, the single worst thing about this movie was Chris O'Dowd. Both he and and his character were unbearable. He was put there as the comedic relief, the only problem being that he's in no way funny. In fact his character tells a joke at one point and another character swiftly says to him, ""That's not funny"" and I thought to myself thank God someone said it!The film also drags a little through the mid to late stages. What should be a fun ride exploring all the possibilities of the paradox, sort of starts to become an 'Armegeddon' type experience where it's more about survival than anything else. So why have I given the film such a high rating? Put simply: the ending. I've often said the way a film ends can be worth up to 80% of the overall quality the film possesses. 'The Cloverfield Paradox' has a truly mind-blowing ending. I actually actually had to go back and watch the final three minutes again just to fully process what I had just seen. This really did turn a '5' movie into at least a '7' for me (I strongly considered an '8' for it). If you're watching this film and you're not digging its vibe please stick around until the ending.

The storyline for this was okay but not revolutionary, obviously a common theme in comic books. The special effects, as always, were very good. I always wonder why all of these movie wait till the very end for the really good special effects. I loved the arm sequences in this, it reminded me of Evil Dead 2 in some ways. I did wonder why they had to have one character in the movie that required subtitles...that was awkward. Overall this was just okay. It is worth a viewing but probably the worst of the trilogy.

Remember how 10 Cloverfield Lane had absolutely nothing to do with the preceding monster movie until the final fifteen minutes? It's like that, only the connecting material is sprinkled randomly throughout the story and, combined, accounts for a grand total of two minutes. It makes zero sense as a tie-in, with the effort only setting unrealistic expectations that the film itself can't possibly meet. In essence, this is as standard as science-fiction templates get. Loosely-explained technology causing problems, an unseen threat, mutinous behavior, a slow depletion of the crew... we've been here before, countless times, and seen it done better.

Too Much of something can impede the uniqueness of any story.This is not to say, there are not good moments in this Netflix made Direct-To-Rental Flick.Nevertheless, there is only one reason why I am not giving this a low rating: The Ending is really good. I had to rewind the Video and watch it several times. It's great. It's worth the rental fee.

I really enjoyed 10 Cloverfield lane so I had some hope for this film but it is incredibly generic and a real let down. The premise of the film sees a crew of international astronauts attempt to save the world. Gugu-mbatha-raw is starting to prove herself to be a real top quality actress. She is great in this film even though the material given to her isn't that good, you sympathize with her character and she delivers some very good emotional beats. David oyelowo and Daniel bruhl are in this film and they do decent jobs in their roles even though the characters are particularly interesting. Everyone else in the film are just cliche characters and I didn't care about any of them, Elizabeth debicki is laughably bad in this film and I knew where her character was going from the minute she was introduced. The story is really convoluted and it feels like a rip off of alien and life and it comes across really poorly. The chemistry between the crew isn't there so you don't really but their relationships or their reactions throughout the film. The script is like the film incredibly bland and generic with the humour and drama blending really poor timing with forced moments that are just not earned. The style of the film is pretty cheap and similar to films I have mentioned in this review, also the cgi is pretty terrible in the film and takes you out of the moment.

The movie had an interesting plot and could've been a great Sci-Fi horror but due to poor execution the movie couldn't match the expectations.The plot of the movie was interesting with a group of people sent in space to save the world but when a mission goes wrong the earth disappears, the main problem starts from here. Whenever someone is sent into space they are usually master of their field but these people acts like novice and instead of finding their way back they are more focused on arguments and fighting with mission going for a toss. Amidst of all these a mysterious appearance of Elizabeth Debicki happens and strange things started happening and people start dying.This is where the movie starts loosing it's plot and viewers start getting distracted and bore. The movie couldn't be able to get the pace afterwards and falls flatly.Acting is average and it seems that Gugu was casted for crying as she was crying all through out the movie. Daniel Bruhl and Elizabeth Debicki was wasted, Chris O'Dowd was impressive, Zhang Ziyi was flat faced throughout the movie. Rest of the characters were equally average. I am still trying to figure out the reason behind the casting of Roger Davies.Screenplay of the movie was slow and boring. The climax of the movie was hurriedly written and it seems that the director was in a hurry to put final nails in the cofin.This movie is one of the prime example to how to waste a decent plot with poor execution.

The world is at the brink of existence so an orbital space station, of course populated w/people from different countries, try to activate a device to save the planet but an alternate dimension is triggered causing the space scientists to work together to solve the mystery all the while each of their number begins to dwindle (because this kind of thing not only happens but is expected). Starring an impressive cast which includes David Oyelowo, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Chris O'Dowd, Zhang Ziyi (I thought she learned English at this point but she speaks Mandarin to the rest of her co-stars & they respond to her English), Daniel Bruhl & hot actress of the moment, Elizabeth Debicki.

42,I_Ailurophile,Not perfect,7,1 March 2021,"'The Cloverfield Paradox' is not the end-all-be-all of sci-fi movies, but it's entertaining, and offers a satisfying conclusion to an ostensible trilogy of mostly unrelated films.2008's 'Cloverfield' was a rather straightforward monster movie; 2016's '10 Cloverfield Lane' was a thriller with multiple twists throughout the narrative. 'The Cloverfield Paradox' offers something a little different with a tale of sci-fi/horror that leans more into the former than the latter with the basic premise: In the near future, a global energy crisis finds the world on the brink of war. An international team of scientists are sent to a highly advanced orbital space station to test a reactor that may be the one hope of averting calamity.The beginning of the movie focuses on the effort to produce results, with the clock ticking: Earth has an estimated 5 years remaining of energy reserves as geopolitical troubles mount. With each successive failure, the pressure and tension builds as months quickly pass, then years. Then, finally, a breakthrough - the reactor works as all had hoped it would. And that's when things go sideways.The scientists on the space station suddenly begin to observe confounding and disturbing events, and apparent inexplicable changes in reality as they know it. They struggle to keep each other in check, and the station in working order, as they strive to return to a planet that desperately needs them.Some of the scenes in 'Paradox' are definitely chilling, but there's no acute fright here, no jump scares. Insofar as the film could be described as horror, it's in the general atmosphere and the feelings of confusion, anxiety, and desperation that weigh on the characters. To that end, the effects look great as the story is told, as do the contributions of wardrobe and make-up.Gugu Mbatha-Raw stars as Ava, the station's communications officer, whose background and perspective gets the most focus in the narrative. It's a refreshingly diverse cast that she leads - and a strong, capable one, with a long list of credits to everyone's names. While there are no ""A-listers"" here, actors' visibility depends very much on the media one consumes, and they've all been very busy. All perform admirably in their roles to bring this tale to life, and if no one particularly stands out it's only because they all excel at their craft.I'm also very pleased with the way that 'The Cloverfield Paradox' gives a sense of loose narrative connectivity to three films whose plots don't directly have anything to do with one another. It's been a question in our minds since '10 Cloverfield Lane' first shared part of its title with 'Cloverfield,' and now we have our answer. Fans can't help but bear a knowing smile at the ""in-universe"" implications - and at the possibility of future movies, should filmmakers decide to revisit the Cloverfield name. For that matter, the closing shot of this feature suggests so much story that could be told, in this instance as an immediate result of 'Paradox's' events.If there's any weakness, it's that the writing leaves a bit to be desired at points. It sometimes seems like multiple ideas were taken up for inclusion without anyone pausing to consider how they'd connect, or how plausible they'd be within the narrative. Which, one could say the same thing about more movies than one has time and energy to name. That doesn't wash away the problems here, but for my part, good ol' suspension of disbelief generally remained intact enough to happily keep watching.'The Cloverfield Paradox' isn't as instantly grabbing as other movies, but that doesn't make it any less entertaining a ride. There's a little bit of body horror in a few scenes that may be a bit much for the squeamish, but otherwise nothing leaps out as being worthy of a content warning. Recommended for fans of the cast or other folks involved with the production, or for fans of science fiction generally - bearing in mind that this isn't going to be a big hit with everyone.I know it has had a rather mixed reception, yet I for one quite enjoyed 'The Cloverfield Paradox.' It's certainly no revelation that demands attention, but I'd watch it again, and sometimes that's all that needs to be said.",The Cloverfield Paradox

I'm afraid if you don't ...
No one will.""""Cloverfield"" was a unique film. Lots of fans were looking forward to a sequel to this amusing found footage monster film. The sequel ""10 Cloverfield lane"" came 8 years later. It didn't feel like this film had anything to do with the initial film. Till the end of the movie. It's clear this one was situated after the events from ""Cloverfield"". And then suddenly this Netflix release pops up from nowhere. ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" tries to explain why all that shit started to happen in Manhattan. Yep, again it's about prequel and sequel stuff. And there's nothing I hate more than prequel and sequel nonsense. It's obvious this movie tries to connect with the original ""Cloverfield"" films, as you can clearly see on the movie poster.However, this film is right up my alley. A SciFi horror on board of a sophisticated space station with crew members trying their best to stay alive. I got a soft spot for such movies. The only problem is that they don't need to defend themselves against cruel and bloodthirsty space aliens. It's a paradox that causes peculiarities. And they caused it themselves. They are sitting on top of a gigantic particle accelerator that, if it works decently, should provide the earth with unlimited amounts of energy. I didn't understand how that works at all. And I doubt whether the makers of the film understood it themselves. What happens afterwards is hilarious on the one hand, and scary on the other. And it was still hard to grasp what was going on.Because the particle accelerator failed to work, they end up in another dimension. Earth is gone and the most absurd events start to happen on board of the spaceship Cloverfield. Before they realize it, they find a teleported person behind a panel. An amputated arm is crawling around. Worms disappear and show up somewhere else. And it turns out that the gyro (a kind of compass) has disappeared. And it's also found again in a not so obvious place. The arm turns out to be very helpfull as well. It reminded me of Thing from ""The Adams Family"" and the severed hand from ""Evil Dead II"". Sounds pretty bizarre, doesn't it?Eventually I had the same feeling about this film as with ""10 Cloverfield Lane"". They both seem to be totally self-contained films that were given a small adjustment at the very last moment in order to be linked to the phenomenon ""Cloverfield"". Both the film from 2016 and this one had a different film title initially and were given a variant with the term Cloverfield in it. Was it a panicky decision? They feared in both cases that it might cause a financial hangover? And was the link with the film, with the most original marketing ever used, a way to create a similar curiosity?I wasn't knocked of my feet by ""10 Cloverfield lane"". I even think they should have released this follow-up under the title ""The God Particle"" and omitted any reference to the Cloverfield universe. As a stand-alone film one could have criticized what the film is, instead of what the film wanted to be. Very bizarre, but the film itself has created a paradox. Despite everything, I was still amused by it.",The Cloverfield Paradox
44,aidanratesmovies,"Very Entertaining, but often senseless",7,23 March 2019,"The Cloverfield Paradox is not a good movie, nor is it nearly as good as its predecessors, and pins a sad new idea on a franchise that can simply call itself anything. However, it is one heck of a ride. You can safely say that you have never seen anything like this film before, and it proves for what may be the most entertaining in the franchise, no matter how stupid it may be. The acting is actually quite good, with the biggest stand out from the films lead actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw. Whatever critics may say about how much of a mess this film may be, it is certainly a unique experience, and one that still found us to be emotionally involved once again. We can only hope something even better will come next.

45,a_chinn,A Hollywood clunker get's a dumped onto Netflix for a quick payday,4,19 February 2018,"Netflix has made a name for themselves by creating smart, well crafted content, but I'm hoping they don't start taking advantage of their good name by releasing Hollywood castoffs like ""The Cloverfield Paradox."" With a surprise announcement during the Super Bowl, the film unexpectedly premiered following the game, instead of the originally planned early summer theatrical release. The loosely connect J.J. Abrams' Cloverfield films started strong with the first film taking the found footage horror subgenera and upped the ante by making what was essentially a found footage Godzilla film (and did it quite well). The second film, ""10 Cloverfield Lane,"" was not advertised as being affiliated with the first Cloverfield film, but had a surprising conclusion that tied the two films together. This sequel was even better than the first film as a claustrophobic and suspenseful thriller about Mary Elizabeth Winstead being ""rescued"" by John Goodman and held captive in his underground bunker in order to protect her from some sort of disaster that he claims has happened out in the outside world. This third film was the first to be marketed as being part of a franchise, but it really doesn't connect all that much with the first two. Instead, it's pretty much a retread of any dozen of other better space thrillers. The story has an international crew experimenting with dangerous new energy sources that end up taking them to an alternate universe where world war three is going on, as well as other strange anomalies onboard their ship. The film borrows everywhere from ""Alien"" to ""Evil Dead"" to an number of other tired space films involving dangerous space walks, airlocks getting shut at the last moment, and just about every other space film cliche you can think of. In terms of production value (photography, music, production design, special effects, etc.) it's a competently made production. Director Julius Onah takes the story through it's paces, and the cast ably acquits themselves as admirably. The real culprit for this film's downfall is the script, which is riddled with cliches, has a dearth of any interesting sci-fi ideas (an average episode Star Trek is vastly more original than this), and offers no real character development and instead populating the film with space movie archetypes (you know, the serious main character, the adversarial jerk character, the comic relief character, the romantic couple, etc.). Overall, despite an able cast and solid production values, this film is an incredibly unoriginal and boring space story you've seen a hundred times before.",The Cloverfield Paradox

49,lemon_magic,Fine actors and decent effects in search of a coherent script,4,9 April 2018,"I don't want to bag on any of the actors here, because the acting wasn't the problem. And the film looked good. But the script proper...yeesh. 
 
I'll put it this way: I can buy into the premise that an overload of the world's most powerful particle accelerator would rip open a hole in reality and cause all kinds of uncanny things to happen. But if you're going to have uncanny things happen (space station appears in an alternate reality, space ship actively tries to kill its crew) you need to write a better script than this. Having a ""rip in reality"" gives the story an excuse to have ""uncanny events"", but it does not excuse lazy writing that never answers the questions it asks There's no consistent internal logic to the uncanny events, or at least none that satisfies. (I.e., if the station wants the crew dead, why does it pick them off one at a time when it could easily kill them all at once? Because we are doing the ""haunted house"" trope, that's why.) Also, the whole subplot with the earthbound husband feels tacked on, and doesn't do a thing to advance the understanding of what is going on with the monsters currently rampaging on Earth. I understand they are trying to pump up the human interest factor, and the actor assigned to the role gives it his all, but this segment also doesn't answer any of the questions it raises. I should also point out that if you are pretending to have a ""hard science"" gloss over a haunted house format, you need to be more careful with the hard science details : for instance, artificial gravity doesn't work in a rotating space ship they way it is portrayed here (the crew ought to be standing on the ""walls"" of these rooms). In short, an unpolished screenplay sinks an interesting premise and leaves us going ""what the hell was going on there?""Gets an additional star because the opening montage of the crew failing again and again over the course of months with their experiment is actually successful and well done.",The Cloverfield Paradox
50,Matt_Layden,Cloverfield in Space,6,5 February 2018,"It's no mistake now that the team behind the Cloverfield series is simply purchasing films that are already shot or written and re-working them to fit within their ""world"". This entry into the series is no different, but at least we have a direct connection and explanation for things, which make this film the main one that will connect every single 'Cloverfield' entry from here on out. In an attempt to produce endless energy, a group of people board a space shuttle known as The Shepard. Over 600 days in space with failure after failure, they finally manage to create something. But that something is not what they expected and now they have to fight to survive and deal with the horrors they've unleashed. There is a moment in the film that is pure exposition, delivered by Donal Logue that really felt forced in there to be an explanation for the monster in the original film. It was such an awkward jumble of words that it stands out like a sore thumb. I felt like they could have delivered this information a bit differently, by someone on the ship maybe. There are other moments of missed opportunities as well, specifically when you are dealing with time paradoxes and alternate realties. The film tries to deliver a sense of dread, but it doesn't really get there. There are moments where the weirdness explodes and we are dealing with severed limbs still working or body horror involving eyes and skin. I get the sense that they wanted these weird occurrences to really amp of the mystery. Sometimes it works, other times it does not. As a whole though, the film does deliver an edge of your seat sic/fi space survival flick. Paramount clearly thought they had a stinker on their hands, which is why they dumped the film to Netflix. Saying this film sucks is a disservice to the material. It's ambitious enough to try and create a connecting tissue to the other films and anything else that Bad Robot wants to come up with. I applaud that, as well as their explanation for why things happened, to me is good enough. This film will be the most divisive one yet, that is clear.",The Cloverfield Paradox

The second was a tedious mish mash of sorts with some glimpse of hope and satisfying ending. The third is just a huge wide-opened question What on Earth was that piece of trash. The film is so bland, empty, pointless, clueless, barren and sordid that only one word can used trying to depict it - Worst.
John DeFire of The Hollywood Reporter called the film a ""trainwreck of a sci-fi flick bent on extending a franchise that should have died a peaceful death almost exactly one decade ago."" How very true. This was to stop after the first clever movie. They wanted to make the direct sequel to that old one. Instead, we have as Dino-Ray Ramos said, ""The Super Bowl trailer for Paradox gave the impression the movie would reveal the origin of the monster that appeared in the 2008 movie and was later on hinted at in the critically acclaimed 2016 follow-up - but it barely did that. Instead, it stalls the franchise as a pastiche of sci-fi cinema veiled in clever marketing.""

55,pyrocitor,10 Cloverfield drafts too few,5,5 February 2018,"{no spoilers here - I know the Cloverfield drill}Cloverfield has always been less a franchise than a multimedia event, thriving on surprise and unpredictability into the closest thing the 21st century has enjoyed to a thinly linked Twilight Zone. Case in point: a promising, albeit inauspicious sci-fi thriller 'God Particle' mysteriously unveiled as a Chapter III no one had been waiting for, but everyone proved excited for. Then: the ante was upped again, with an unprecedented day-of announcement that the film would be spontaneously released on Netflix on February 4th, over two months prior to its announced theatrical release date. Surprise! Sadly, for all of the furious rush and smoke and mirrors heralding its release, The Cloverfield Paradox is less paradoxical and more promising first draft - an energetic, engaging, and thrillingly tense sci-fi caper that proves disconcertingly hollow within, and the first Cloverfilm to fall short of its ratcheted up expectations. In fact, Cloverthree-ld's primary paradox is how a such a fundamentally messy film can be, at once, so neatly proficient and accomplished in its telling. Boasting airtight direction by Julius Onah, impressively credible FX, crisp cinematography channelling a Ridley Scott Alien vibe, counterpointing the sweeping vastness of space and claustrophobic confines of a ship therein, and a robust, gleefully old-fashioned Bernard Herrmann-esq score by 10 Cloverfield Lane vet Bear McReary, it's a cracking ride, full of shocking twists, inventively gruesome visuals, and festering suspicions. The space station's international cast even wink at thematically functioning as a 'faux-UN in space,' flirting with just enough superficial sociopolitical tension without becoming tiresomely didactic. All this, and nary a trace of nauseating shaky-cam in sight (that's, like, so Cloverfield I, m'kay)! But, post-film, by the time you grumpily interrupt Netflix from cueing an unwanted recommendation mid-credits, reality rears its monstrous head, with a persistent and ever-growing ""Heyyyy, wait a minute...!"" After gasping at the film's barrage of shocking happenstances, we're retroactively left with the buzzkill of picking up the pieces of all the (many) dangling, unresolved plot threads. With plot holes pockmarking the film like craters on the moon, and leaning on some of the wonkiest faux-convenient movie science in years, it's a film that reeks of a bold, fully-realized start perhaps particle-accelerated into being a bit prematurely. And the culprit? Methinks the claw marks of a Bad Robot are abound here. Despite the name, mystique, and hype of being a surprise franchise-building, linking the-artist-formerly-known-as-God-Particle to the Cloverfield universe feels like somewhat of a clumsy, unnecessary retrofit, with hurried last minute rewrites (including some garish, eye-roll-worthy exposition) perhaps explaining the synergy of such a careful telling of such a careless plot. Still, even the internal logic clamours with red flags (none the least being the crew's magical, unexplained bilingualism, conversing perfectly fluidly in English with Zhang Ziyi's staunchly Mandarin-speaking engineer, more clumsy Hollywood convenience than utopic futuristic multilingualism), which increasingly threaten to distract from the spooky fun. Thankfully, the excellent ensemble cast help carry a lot of the slack. They're given uniformly slim characterizations, but play them to the hilt, generating reliably terse, engrossing performances, particularly leads Gugu Mbatha-Raw, David Oyelowo, Daniel Brühl, and Roger Davies. Finally, although it sometimes seems like he's popped his head in from an adjacent movie, the always wonderful Chris O'Dowd remains a welcome repository of irreverently grim comic relief throughout. It's genuinely rare and exciting to see a big-studio franchise play with expectation and delivery with such glee as Cloverfield, which is why the careless muddle of Paradox, mindlessly entertaining though it is, feels like a disconcerting step back. With any luck, there's life yet in the Cloverfuture, and that Abrams and co. have more future shocks and left-field distribution strategies up their cinematic sleeves. Let's just hope the shock of unfinished, baldly inconclusive faux-franchise scripts takes its place, along with dear shaky-cam, firmly in the annals of history. -5.5/10",The Cloverfield Paradox

Other than that I take a movie's premise on face value when watching sci-fi. So I was intrigued with the story here on theoretical merit alone.The acting in ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" is lukewarm. The cast is a collection of notable talent, yet most performances either fell a bit flat or seemed two-dimensional. It has some pretty good moments that seem to happen surprisingly and randomly during some dialog scenes, and some of the action moments are cool. Alot of the time though you can almost hear the word ""action"". Not really but...Now I dug the special effects. The settings had an almost revamped ""2001 : Space Odyssey"" feel and the CGI is theatre quality. The last third is really the only indication this is a Cloverfield movie, and the ending is one you know is coming way in advanced, but it is a cool ending.

SPOILER REVIEW AHEAD DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED.The film takes place in a space station where the crew is trying to find a way to harness energy which is needed on Earth. After a mishap, the travel to a parallel dimension and encounter a crew member who claims to be from that dimension. On Earth, one of the crew member's husband seems to be in a world where a monster attack or a disaster occurred and is trying to survive in the world. Sounds vague doesn't it? Well it is, and the film is an absolute mess of a disappointment.The acting performances are good. However, the film borrows a lot from other isolated space films (there's elements of Alien, Life, and Gravity in it). I dug the idea of a parallel dimension but what occurs in this film just complicates the Cloverfield universe and its timeline and mystique. The film brings up ideas of different dimensions and the final scene will make you wonder if the same planet from the first film is the one even being referenced. They need to stop with the over-complicated dimensional thought and provide answers.The scripts are clearly independent scripts that are being then re shot with scenes to link it to Cloverfield. That's the case with the second and this film. It hurts the series massively because the link is actually quite minuscule. This is probably an ambitious lower level space thriller on its own, but linking it to Cloverfield just makes it worse. Also, the Superbowl ad is very misleading not leading to any answers to the monster's origins. Its all still guesswork even after 102 minutes. Its unnecessary to the series, and having the Cloverfield name slapped on to a film that barely relates and just makes things more complicated is terrible.4/10",The Cloverfield Paradox
62,petra_ste,Maybe in a parallel universe this was Best Original Screenplay,5,7 January 2019,"MAJOR SPOILERSYou know the kind of friend who is always desperate to impress the group? So he tells a midly interesting anecdote, which turns into an unlikely boast and then escalates into blatant lies. The more he goes on, the less you are impressed; by the end, even the initially neat anecdote becomes irritating.The Cloverfield Paradox follows the same storytelling school as this lying friend. This story of a group of astronauts working on a particle accelerator but ending up in a parallel universe had potential. This feels like an early draft though, messy, confusing and poorly thought-out.Plot holes don't automatically spoil my enjoyment of a movie. I don't give a flying goat how it's implausible that Indy hangs to the U-Boot in Raiders. I'm not bothered by the family in A Quiet Place managing a farm in perfect silence. I notice this kind of stuff and, if it doesn't go overboard and the film is good, I'm happy to let it slide.But the Cloverfield Paradox really is a string of nonsense. It's not boring or unwatchable, just baffling.The space station ends up in a parallel universe. The new universe's space station has crashed but, inside the Original Universe Space Station (OUSS), the crew finds a member of the other station. Shouldn't she have died with her universe's station, like the rest of her crew? Why is she there? Why her and only her? Because parallel universe!A gyroscope and some lab worms teleport inside the body of a character - who is seemingly unaffected for a while, although he has stuck inside his body an object as big as a cannon ball and a miriad of crawling creatures. Why? Because parallel universe!An astronaut loses an arm, absorbed into the wall of the station. The arm later shows up, moving indipendently and apparently sentient, able to communicate with the group. Why? Because parallel universe!The experiment on the OUSS unleashes monsters on Earth - the same creature(s) of the first Cloverfield, apparently, although the timeline seems different. No upcoming war or energy crisis was even remotely implied in the first movie (if anything, they had the best camera batteries ever). The setup for this development is a fleeting interview with a scientist who claims the experiment may... unleash monsters on Earth (good call, dude!). Why? Because parallel universe!Incidentally, don't watch this for the Cloverfield monster; it has a screentime of maybe five seconds at the end. In fact, the whole subplot with the husband on Earth driving around and glimpsing at destroyed buildings feels like the result of reshoots and is irrelevant to the main story - remember Sean Bean in Silent Hill?Also, there is supposed to be a devastating energy crisis, but the only sign is a blackout at the beginning. Apart from that, people use cars, cell phones, television... it feels lazy. It you want to convey how desperate the situation is, have characters on Earth light candles, burn furniture... show, don't tell.I didn't hate The Cloverfield Paradox. The premise had potential, although it needed more re-evaluations than the Maginot Line before WW2. When the severed arm writes a message to the crew delivering crucial information no character from either universe could know (and again, it's not a character but a severed arm), it's not cool, it feels desperate. ""Parallel universe!"" becomes a catch-all excuse for every absurd development the movie tosses at viewers.The visuals look neat; I'd be irked if I was one of the special effect guys and all my hard work went into this. Same for the actors: they all do a competent job, including protagonist Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Daniel Brühl, Zhang Ziyi, Elizabeth Debicki and Chris O'Dowd as the comic relief.The real paradox is how you can spend money for great effects and a solid cast and waste them on this script. It's like getting a decorated chef for your restaurant and asking him to make a steak tartare with a rotten badger.5/10",The Cloverfield Paradox
63,bankofmarquis,"A fun ""who will survive"" flick",7,22 February 2018,"During the Super Bowl, a ""surprise"" trailer dropped for a new entry in the Cloverfield family of films. The good news is that the film was dropping on Netflix the next day, so fanboys immediately jumped on-line and then started hating on it (again, on-line) because it wasn't exactly what they thought it would be.Which is too bad, for THE CLOVERFIELD PARADOX is a very fun, very well made, very well acted ""10 Little Indians"" style Sci-Fi film (you know, the type of film where a finite group of folks are marooned someplace - like and island or an isolated, creepy mansion and are picked off one by one). This time, they are on a space station, and when an experiment goes awry, bad things start to happen.I stated that this film is another entry in the ""Cloverfield family of films"", so let me explain that. The overseer of these films is none other than JJ Abrams and he has stated that there will be a series of films - very different in style, type and substance - that will (somehow) be related in the Cloverfield Universe. And, so far, he has fulfilled his promise (at least to me) - for those that just want ""more of the same"", he has alienated.The first film, CLOVERFIELD, is a ""found footage"" film about a giant monster (think Godzilla) rampaging through modern day New York City. Of the 3 films,thus far, in the Cloverfield family, this one (for me) was the least effective (especially because I am not a big fan of ""found footage"" films). The 2nd film was 2016's 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE and was a very effective psychological horror/drama starring John Goodman as a fellow who has rescued/captured (kidnapped?) Mary Elizabeth Winstead and has locked her in his survival bunker in order to - he says - save her from the monster above. The film effectively goes back and forth with wondering what is scarier - the monster above or the monster (Goodman) below. If you haven't seen 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE, I highly recommend it.The third installment, then, is THE CLOVERFIELD PARADOX, a prequel of sorts about a group of scientists aboard a space station conducting a desperate, highly dangerous power experiments to solve the world's energy crisis. When something goes wrong, bad things happen. And since this is in the Cloverfield family, you gotta know it has some connection with how the Cloverfield monster got on Earth.But this film doesn't really concern itself with the Cloverfield monster - which is what I think is angering the ""fanboys"" - this film is about the survival of the charismatic, international scientists that are stranded on this space station after the accident. Almost every one of the actors in this film are ""oh...that guy"" type actors - all very good. From German actor Daniel Bruhl (RUSH) to Chinese actress Ziyi Zhang (CROUCHING TIGER...) to Englishman David Oyelowo (SELMA) to good ol' John Ortiz (a million different things) - the cast is strong, fun to watch and easy to root for. They all are in service to the plot devices (and predicaments they are in) and they serve the plot (and the film) well.Special notice should be made for Chris O'Dowd (BRIDESMAIDS) who brings some much needed levity via his deadpan humor approach to everything as the ship's handyman and, especially, Gugu Mbatha-Raw (BELLE) as the heroine of the adventure from through who's eyes we encounter the events of the film.I have stated before that I am a sucker for these types of ""10 Little Indians who-will-survive"" films and this one is no exception. Go in with no preconceived notions, roll with what the film throws at you and you'll have a good time time, too.THE CLOVERFIELD PARADOX is now streaming on Netflix.Letter Grade: B (it is the very definition of a ""B"" movie).7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",The Cloverfield Paradox
64,jrarichards,"Clever for 5 seconds, but otherwise far more chaotic than the chaos it portrays",5,18 April 2019,"This is one of those films showing crew members of a space station with uniforms that have national flags on the arm. And since the first one seen is the flag of the UK, we watching Brits may feel a fleeting flush of pride that is probably the most emotion we're going to get out of Julius Onah's directoral work, as well as money put up by J.J. Abrams.Otherwise, if you think those flags mean you've seen this kind of thing before, well you have. And some of those other films at least were a deal better than ""Paradox"", made years ago as they may have been.A space station is not a planet (or even a city or village) - it's small and boring. So mostly films like this head off in a psychological direction, or else resort to monsters (or monstrously taken-over crew members) stalking those corridors, bays and pods. Here we (naturally) try a bit of both - at the expense of both genres. Furthermore, in a desperate attempt to compensate for the above, they've tacked on a third ""what's going on back home as the station crew struggle"" element to the story, but this is so minimalist - in the most negative sense of that term - that it's basically just time-wasting.And sadly, what's going on in orbit is not much more rivetting, or logical, or well-done. One performance here that seems vaguely fresh is that of Irishman Chris O'Dowd (usually a good turn in films) - though his quirky sense of humour is certainly out of place here, if actually quite refreshing. After something like ""Belle"" and ""Black Mirror"", Gugu Mbatha-Raw has gone backwards to take the starring role of Ava (who toys with ""many-worlds"" aspects before giving up on them in another busted flush); while familiar face Daniel Bruhl is coasting it (which may be a kind of relief as his bad films are really bad, even if his good ones are great). And truly, these and others appear in 102 minutes of not too much happening, with the gore not gory enough, the science not scientific enough, the chaos - well chaotic, certainly, but only in the least productive sense - and shortlived. One minute we are told that any physical effect is now possible (a kind of catch-all plot excuse that really cuts no ice with a discerning viewer) ... and the next minute there's nothing much happening at all anyway!If you manage to hang on to the end of this (and I was unlucky enough to have purchased the DVD, so had every incentive), you do get a fleeting moment of pleasure. But even that is a kind of cheat, as it is the closest you get to Cloverfield as we have known it so far, and that just means that you experience fond memories of a film FAR, FAR better than the one you've just been watching. Cloverfield Lane is hardly referenced in ""Paradox"", and since the former was really quite a great film, that's perhaps not surprising.Whoops.",The Cloverfield Paradox
65,pietclausen,Weird movie based on nonsense scientific fact,3,4 February 2019,"This movie looked appealing, but it is merely a horror story, some sort of drama, no thriller, no sci-fi, but the biggest load of absolute nonsense. The last 15 minutes gave some pleasure before it turned to dung, not ending in any fun.",The Cloverfield Paradox
66,kjproulx,A Surprise Film That's Surprisingly Mediocre,6,6 February 2018,"The fact that Cloverfield even became a loose franchise boggles my mind. Back in 2008 when the original film was released, I saw it as a cool alien invasion flick with secrets that it wanted to keep hidden. After rumors that a sequel would eventually arrive, I don't believe 10 Cloverfield Lane is what they were expecting. That being said, 10 Cloverfield Lane was a superior film in terms of tension, as well as the loose connection it made to the original movie. Now, without any real promotion, The Cloverfield Paradox has arrived on Netflix. Being the third instalment in this loose franchise, taking us to space is yet another thing that I don't think anyone expected before reading the synopsis. Nevertheless, a new sequel has arrived, and the biting questions everyone seems to be asking are whether or not it has a closer connection to the first and whether or not it's a good film. So, let's dive in and see if either of those things are true.The rest of this review isn't going to spoil anything about the movie, but since there hasn't been any real promotion, some people may consider the slightest plot detail to be a spoiler, so you've been warned.Aside from a few references throughout the first act of the film, this movie stands on its own as its own movie, just like 10 Cloverfield Lane did. That being said, there are some pretty obvious connections it makes as the movies go along, but I won't discuss those any further in this review. The Cloverfield Paradox follows a crew of scientists across space as they try to solve an entry crisis on Earth. Making a few mistakes during this process, they're sent to an alternate dimension and discover that strange things have begun to happen. That's the basic premise, and hearing that alone would've excited me enough to buy a ticket to this in theatres, but I can also see why it went straight to Netflix.Although 10 Cloverfield Lane was a very low-budget movie, pretty much taking place in just a couple rooms, this is very much in the same vein, but with a few solid special effects added in. The feel of this movie definitely feels smaller scale than even the original, which was made to feel cheap and realistic, so this is why I found Netflix to be the proper release. Setting that aside, I was pretty impressed by the performances here and the surprises that this film delivers are worth the wait.This film isn't going to win any awards, and quite frankly isn't nearly as good as the previous two instalments, but from comedic moments to genuinely questionable scenarios that constantly presented themselves, to vague references to what's happening on Earth, to interesting characters being thrown into the mix halfway through the runtime, I found myself enjoying this movie, for the most part. It wasn't too long and kept up a nice pace, even though the plot points felt very, very familiar.Many people will be frustrated that it's not a direct sequel to either of the previous films, and while I'm okay with it not being that way, I also found myself puzzled as to why the story felt so distant, and yet they found reasons to pull aspects of the original into it. On top of that, aspects of pretty much every single movie that ever took place on a space shuttle are present here and you can see a lot of twists coming from a mile away.In the end, this works as a solid movie to watch on Netflix, but it does nothing new for this franchise and instead of expanding things, I found this third instalment to be one that chose to close a few doors that I was hoping to eventually explore further at some point in the future. The story is pretty generic, the direction is good enough, the performances are solid, and the tie-ins are cool, but ultimately predictable. The Cloverfield Paradox will be a nice watch for fans of the first film, but it's pretty average when looking at it as a film in its own right.",The Cloverfield Paradox
67,kuarinofu,"Oh, J.J., you've done it again!",4,11 February 2018,"I don't know why most of the reviewers seem to be so upset by this.This movie perfectly represents what it's trying to be. It is just so obvious.
Like, come on, guys, J.J. has already done that. Just take a different movie, add 5% of the related content and boom - 10 Cloverfield Lane, BOOM - The Cloverfield Paradox. This type of copy-paste movies sometimes provide for interesting results (like with 10 Cloverfield Lane, it wasn't bad).The ""insert name here"" Paradox was a mediocre sci-fi movie with a good premise but completely lost direction. Seriously, the first half of the movie was quite interesting, but the second is just such a ridiculous mess. The script was obviously unfinished and had a lot of rewriting done by different people, the second part of the movie clearly shows that.Then J.J. saw an opportunity to still make some money out of it. They took the script, inserted all the Earth scenes (because they do look incredibly different in tone, and they were clearly shot indoors in like a week). They re-labeled the movie adding ""Cloverfield"" to the title to get the attention of the fanbase. It's that easy.There's even no need to try to point out all the stupidity in the movie, there's just so much.Why not just take this script and improve it, make it a standalone movie?

69,msbreviews,Rating: C+,5,6 March 2018,"If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)The Cloverfield Paradox is one of my Most Anticipated Movies of 2018 due to my unconditional love for Cloverfield and 10 Cloverfield Lane, all of them produced by the great J.J. Abrams.This film tells the story about a group of scientists on a space station with the mission of harnessing a new unlimited energy source since the Earth is suffering from a crisis that can end the planet's energy resources in five years.This is an extremely difficult review to write. With so high expectations going into this movie and with so many theories on how would the three films be connected, I found myself scratching my head for days. I want to keep this review spoiler-free and I will. However, I might be too vague for my readers who haven't yet seen the movie, so to those people, I say ""watch it"". If you are a fan of the previous two, you have to watch even if it is the worst film ever (it isn't).I am going straight to the point. The screenplay is kind of a mess. I love ambiguity, open endings and all sorts of mystery, but The Cloverfield Paradox does all of this in excess. There are so many theories of how the movies are connected that there isn't a clear path to an answer. Anyone can either attack or defend this film, every theory out there has its inconsistencies, therefore it is impossible to identify what is the correct one.I spent days thinking about it, I read a bunch of online theories and the truth is that there is an abundance of uncertainty. There is a big difference between a story that requires the viewer to think through it in order to fully understand it and a story that literally exposes so much information that it does not give the viewer a definite route to find an explanation.As of right now, I still can't find a single theory that can't be easily disproven. This movie has so many side-stories crumbled into the major one which only helps to increase the confusion and it all becomes very convoluted. Throughout the film, there are so many details that go unexplained and the movie's logic becomes absurd. I am confused just by writing this review! If it is this hard to explain this film, imagine trying to tie everything in with the others.I love J.J. Abrams and the marketing is always mind-blowing, but this time it did not work, at all. I rarely say this, but this screenplay needed, at least, 30 minutes more to fully explain everything with no hiccups. Obviously, it needed to be better written as well. There are a lot of lazy and unnecessary exposition scenes, which is something extremely uncommon coming from JJ. Genre-wise, it is nothing I haven't seen before, it is similar to other sci-fi thrillers in space (Alien, Life, ...), but I can work with that as long as it is captivating.Tonally, the movie sometimes falters. Some jokes fall flat, some work, but all of them feel a bit forced. However, even though the story is a total mess, everything else is perfectly fine. The cast is surprisingly brilliant and they carry the entire thing. Gugu Mbatha-Raw (Hamilton) is the lead and she is flawless. I mean, she is really amazing and her character is definitely the better developed.Hamilton's tragic backstory is undoubtedly a very well-written one and I even felt emotional during a particular scene near the end. Her subplot is by far the most captivating and the emotional dilemma she has to go through in the last act, is something extremely challenging and it actually stuck with me. ""What would I have done in her place?"" might be the question that most people are trying to figure out (ignoring the connection between the films, obviously).The rest of the cast is great and their characters are fairly developed. Elizabeth Debicki (Jensen) portrays the most mysterious character in the movie and, even though she follows a predictable storyline, Debicki does a wonderful job of keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. Julius Onah does a very impressive job directing this film, having in mind that he had to deal with this jumble of a screenplay.The dialogues follow a natural flow, the action sequences are pretty well-handled and the suspense is held at high levels. The editing has no major flaws, the cinematography is really cool since it gives that claustrophobic, isolated and confined space that I absolutely adore. The score helps the tension and suspense rise, and the pacing is the most important technical aspect since the fast rhythm that it implements never lets the movie have a dull moment, so I always felt entertained throughout the entire runtime.I love the film's main premise, but the connection between the movies has so many inconsistent theories that I can't grab into one that helps me praise the story. One thing is certain: if I was 100% captivated during the 102 minutes, it is due to the fact that I didn't want to miss a single thing since this is a franchise that I love so much. I really would like to give this a positive rating, but I can't. I am sad for the excess of negative reviews it is getting (I don't think it deserves that many, but I understand that other people can't deal with their high expectations as well as I do), especially because I definitely want to see another film that can bring some sense into all of this.All in all, The Cloverfield Paradox disappointingly fails to deliver and reach my expectations. A very convoluted story does not help to connect the movies but to develop inconsistent theories easily disproven by the screenplay's mess. For a film with a mind-blowing marketing process, it not only disappointed fans of the franchise but everyone that became interested in it. Genre-wise it is not ground-breaking and it tonally oscillates between well and badly balanced. However, not all is bad. The cast is brilliant and the characters are well-developed, with Gugu delivering a fantastic performance by portraying Hamilton. Technically without major flaws and with a very captivating main premise as well as a fast pacing, which kept me enthralled throughout the whole runtime and wishing for a fourth movie that can finally explain everything.",The Cloverfield Paradox

Still it was intriguing enough and offered a new perspective on things. The only problem I really had with it, was that it stole a lot of elements from other films. Sure it further developed those ideas but still left me with the bitter feeling that it had a lack of originality. The twists however worked and I kind of liked the connection to the other films. Acting wise it was all right but only Gugu Mbatha-Raw is really worth to mention, as she gave a fine lead performance. Daniel Brühl was a bit pale, a performance that is not put o his usual standards. Same goes to David Oyelowo who was generally very wasted. Nice to see Ziyi Zhang again, it's been a while. Elizabeth Debicki was rather annoying at times and overacted a lot. The special effects could have been better, but I guess due to the very limited budget they were decent enough. Nice score.

74,ronakkotian,This franchise is seriously getting messy,2,8 July 2021,"Cloverfield was good and I also liked 10 Cloverfield Lane even though its ending was very forced. Unfortunately, this film is nothing compared to those two.The Cloverfield Paradox follows a group of astronauts that attempt to use a dangerous device to solve Earth's energy crisis but instead come face to face with a dark alternate reality.The Cloverfield Paradox was marketed as the film that explains the origins of Cloverfield and was supposed to tie all three films together. However, like 10 Cloverfield Lane, this film barely has anything to do with Cloverfield at all. This film was originally a script titled ""God Particle"" and then J. J. Abrams decided to make this a part of the franchise by adding a couple scenes linking it together. This was the same thing that happened with 10 Cloverfield Lane but what saved that film was its story, characters, claustrophobic environment and constant sense of tension. However, the same cannot be said about The Cloverfield Paradox.A huge problem with this film was its lack of story and characterisation. I cared about none of the characters because the writers made no effort to make them likeable to me. The main character is given a small piece of development but nothing substantial to make me truly care about her. The story is something we've seen before but this film does nothing new with its premise. In fact, I got pretty bored as I didn't care about what was going on. There was an entire subplot with the main character's husband which contributed nothing. I don't understand the purpose of it. The dialogue is shoddily written, the background score was dull and things happen that make no sense without any explanation. In terms of positives, the acting is decent from everyone involved and the CGI is great.The saddest part is how the film barely explained the origin of Cloverfield. I'm not sure what J. J. Abrams is doing to this franchise because the timeline seems even more messy now and things don't seem to add up. Hopefully we'll get an actual sequel/prequel to Cloverfield in the future rather than picking up scripts that have nothing to do with the franchise at all.",The Cloverfield Paradox
75,trinaboice,Confusing and disappointing,2,15 February 2018,"Grade: DRating: Not rated officially, but it should be R.In a Nutshell: To call Cloverfield a trilogy is a bit of a stretch. The three films are loosely related with a few connected Easter eggs, each one depending on the former films to garner fans and box office success. The fan base is small, as evidenced by the very limited theater release. The biggest surprise is that the first time the trailer for the movie was ever shown was at Super Bowl LII (2018), which was the very same night the movie was shown on Netflix.

Things I liked:
I actually liked the first two installments in this franchise. I like that the three are different from each other and make you try to think.
Chris O'Dowd has the best lines in the movie.
The lovely Elizabeth Debicki has quite an entrance.
This will be a fun movie to make fun of at a teenage late-night party.
Some of the acting was good.
Things I didn't like:
J.J. Abrams is great at NOT telling you what's going on. Your brain will explode if you spend too much time trying to figure out any of this. It's occasionally entertaining and mostly confusing, meant mostly for Cloverfield fans.
David Oyelowo is too good for this silly script.
You'd think that everyone on the space station would be able to speak the same language. Tam (played by Ziyi Zhang) kept speaking Mandarin with no subtitles. People spoke to her in English and seemed to understand what she was saying, which is just another odd element in the movie. I've actually been trying to learn Mandarin, but subtitles would have been super helpful since I'm terrible at Mandarin. 
Rumor has it that the next chapter in the Cloverfield story. Next? Yeah, you heard me. Do we really want more of this? There is talk of an entire Cloverfield universe. (sigh) 
Apparently, the Cold War is still going strong in the future.
Multiverse nonsense. There are way too many theories, dimensions, and timelines going on here for the average person to keep up with or enjoy.
Some really dumb lines like, ""We're going to survive! We have to!""
Cat fight in space. ha ha
The original title was ""The God Particle."" Then, it was advertised as ""Cloverfield 3."" No wonder we're confused...so are the writers.

78,PyroSikTh,Paradox Might be the Hidden Key!,7,5 February 2018,"It's Cloverfield time again, boys and girls! If you weren't aware (and why would you be?), the third Cloverfield film was released last night on Netflix, minutes after it's trailer debut. Yep. The Cloverfield Paradox got even less marketing than 10 Cloverfield Lane. I'm not even sure how they can give the fourth one (supposedly coming next year) less than that.Nevertheless, The Cloverfield Paradox is the latest, and it's an interesting one. It might even be the key to unlocking the whole franchise. There's an energy crisis on Earth and a group of scientists have been sent into space to work on a new, infinite energy source, by crashing atoms together like in the Large Hadron Collider. The latest experiment works briefly before things go wrong and all matter of bizarre events take place, like the Earth disappearing. Basically this infinite energy source managed to transport them across time and space, and smushed two dimensions together in a crude hodge-podge.Cut out the Cloverfield connections, and this film is right up my alley already. It starts off really well with all manner of bizarre things happening. The exposition was a little too quick and a little too on-the-nose, but it at least gets all the posturing out the way so that the actual story can kick in; with the scientists trying to figure out how to fix what went wrong.As for those Cloverfield connections though. On one hand it's really easy to see how it got shoehorned in to the franchise. There's pretty much no dialogue from any of the main characters referencing anything from the previous two films. Instead we get a sub-plot on Earth that really doesn't hold a lot of importance, we get an interview early on with someone seemingly related to Howard from Lane spouting about monsters, demons, and ""creatures from the sea"", as well as a smattering of Easter Eggs from in-universe companies, like the Kelvin gas station at the beginning, the Slush-O cup on the counter, and even some more obscure references in technology from companies parented by Tagruato.While it makes Paradox more connected than Lane ever was, I'm not entirely sure it inherently adds much to the film itself. That said, what it does do in tying it to those previous films, is sort of explain what the hell is going on, and why they're all related. The brief interview we get talks about ripping apart time and space, and unleashing things from other dimensions. While the three movies are individually unconnected, they could easily be connected by a multiverse. How many alternate dimensions there are is unclear, but there must be at least two, if not three or four, and the effect the experiment has on time is also unclear. After all the first Cloverfield still takes place in 2008, with the Clover creature not being mentioned by characters in either Lane or Paradox despite clearly taking place afterwards (Paradox doesn't even take place in the present, but at least ten years from now), and the fourth film supposedly takes place in World War II. Whatever effects this experiment really had, its almost certain that it's the experiment in Paradox that connects everything together, maybe even causes everything (the Clover creature's emergence in Cloverfield, and the red flash in Lane that kicks off the alien invasion).But anyway, back to the actual movie. I'm not going to lie, it's not a great sci-fi that'll go down in history. It has some nice ideas, but still falls back on some tired space station clichés. A lot of the details never really get explained, such as a helpful arm, or the appearance of a gun (that looks like a plastic toy, unfortunately), characters make stupid decisions despite being clever scientists and astronauts, the laws of space and physics are ignored in favour of drama, action, and/or tension, and by the end it becomes another space slasher as each crew member is knocked off one-by-one in different ways. For some these are major drawbacks that will make the film a waste of time, but for me they're really just minor niggles. The concept alone makes Paradox stand out for me, and while there aren't any truly revelatory twists or turns, it still manages to stay reasonably unpredictable from beginning to end.Gugu Mbatha-Raw is really, really good as the film's emotional centrepoint, despite her more weighty scenes feeling a little thin, and Chris O'Dowd is pure entertainment in every scene he's in. Elizabeth Debicki gives us a character to make us feel conflicted over as well, toeing a grey area of morals to make you think. Daniel Bruhl, John Ortiz, David Oyelowo, and Ziyi Zhang end up being little more than scenery and plot devices though, despite there being potential in each and every one of their characters, which is unfortunate.It's not the best Cloverfield film, but honestly it's not that far off from the first one that kicked it all off. I can see and understand a lot of criticisms Paradox has received so far (it's been out less than 24 hours after all), but I found it way too intriguing, and definitely entertaining enough, not to really care all that much about it's pitfalls. I give The Cloverfield Paradox an enjoyable and interesting 7/10. Definitely worth watching if you're a fan of the whole Cloverfield mythos.",The Cloverfield Paradox
79,sweidman-28016,Disappointed,5,28 October 2018,"I just finished watching The Cloverfield Paradox for the second time. I had been wanting for this movie to come out for a long time since I heard they were doing it. The movie franchise is known for their very secretive marketing so it's very exciting to see what they bring. When the trailer came out during the Super Bowl last night I was very thrilled and even more excited when they announced it would be on Netflix once the game was done. Once the game finished I rushed onto Netflix and watched it right away. Usually when I'm tired I don't analyze or think about movies and usually like it. Last night I really liked it for some reason. Once I got to bed though I kept thinking and thinking about it and started to like it less. The reviews on the movie were very divided. People either really loved it or hated it. So tonight I decided to watch it again. The Cloverfield Paradox would've been a pretty good movie had it not been in the Cloverfield anthology. But because it's in the anthology you have to consider the other two movies (Cloverfield and 10 Cloverfield Lane). The movie was marketed as the movie to tie the other two together, but it really didn't. It just created plot holes and messed up the timeline of the movies even more. The movie was confusing and trippy which was good at times but made it hard to follow. Some stuff wasn't explained which made it worse to catch on. It failed at being a horror movie and more of a space thriller kind of. The performances were good in my opinion it's just that we didn't have character development though, except for one person. The movie created a lot of theories trying to explain how the movies all fit in together. I support the alternate dimensions one (you'd have to see all the movies and read it to fully understand) but it is not confirmed. Had this not been apart of the series it would've been a descent space thriller, but since it is connected with the other two it leaves a lot of questions and plot holes.
My Grade: C+",The Cloverfield Paradox
80,funtasticfour,good but is it really Cloverfield?,7,11 February 2018,"I loved the first Cloverfield, which was a new take on a Godzilla type story. The second one was equally enjoyable, in a different genre completely. This third movie that supposedly connects the two previous...is good but the connecting is a stretch. On its own, this movie is a decent space thriller that has a few new ideas but nothing too out of the ordinary. Of course the idea is probably to leave unanswered questions for more movies, and I'm fine with that. But this is the least interesting of the three so far, and I hope that the next one is more exciting/original like the first two were. Worth a watch for sci-fi lovers, but don't expect too many answers.",The Cloverfield Paradox
81,nitzanhavoc,"The first was superb, the second had exquisite acting, the third is just a little short of an insult to the franchise.",5,2 August 2018,"The last part (currently) of the Cloverfield series is just as one might have expected, considering it had been supposed to be an altogether separate film before its rights were purchased and J. J. Abrams took the wheel. That is, it's a pretty solid film with an interesting plot, a compelling story and an overall nice Sci-Fi feel if you're into the genre, but any relation and similarities between this film and the two previous ones is purely coincidental. It completely feels like the script and story were complete before the powers that be decided to add a few scenes and a lone here and there in order to connect everything to the Cloververse.Don't get me wrong, it's not like the 2nd film (10 Cloverfield Lane) felt any more relevant to the franchise, the whole monster incident is nothing but a background setting there. But here, it feels a lot more forced and a lot less authentic and natural. I mean come, this entire film only to offer a remotely relevant and logical explanation as to the appearance of the monsters, which is not more than implied and requires further reading to even recognize? I think this film could have okay without this forced link to Clovefield, and that Cloverfield deserves another title which is actually created as one for the start.To anyone who hasn't understood anything I've been blabbering about - The Cloverfield Paradox is an average Sci-Fi film with some suspenseful moments and just a bit of forced unauthentic Horror. If you enjoy Sci-Fi space disasters films and you don't expect to be mind-blown - you could very well enjoy this. I personally have sadly found the experience to be barely rewarding and almost disappointing.",The Cloverfield Paradox

83,stevenrotherforth,A clever marketing ploy or just Paramounts way of trying to flog a dead horse?,3,17 February 2018,"The Cloverfield Paradox This movie had a surprising release. It had a trailer during the Super Bowl teasing it's release on Netflix to coincide straight after the event.
A clever marketing ploy or just Paramounts way of trying to flog a dead horse?
I think it maybe the latter.
I can just see it now, a group of studio executives with head in hands trying to figure out how to market a seemingly unmarketable movie.
Not even Del Boy could sell this lemon.
Just what is this film supposed to be?
Is it a standalone Sci-Fi movie or a Cloverfield prequel?
God only knows.
Was it actually originally filmed to be part of the Cloverfield franchise to begin with or did they just insert the word Cloverfield into the title, record a few voice overs saying ""Cloverfield ""and tag a scene with a bigger than usual Cloverfield monster on to the end?
It's like a studio taking some generic Shark movie and inserting John Williams famous score from Jaws.
""Ooh look now we have new Jaws movie!""
No! No you don't!!!
It's making my brain hurt trying to figure out this utterly crap movie!
This film doesn't work on any level. It's so confusing that it fails to fit in with what has gone before and it is so inconsistent in its storytelling that nothing makes sense.There's a pretty decent cast here but it's as if they all just turned up at the set and made it up as they went along.
The plot revolves around a team of astronauts on a Space station
which is called Cloverfield.
I can't consciously remember the astronauts themselves referring to the station by that name only the radio contact from Earth control.The astronauts are trying to figure out how to create an infinite energy supply because Earth is on the brink of collapse and all countries are at each other's throats.
Don't ask me how they plan to do this? It all sounds ridiculous and like the movies plot, totally unfathomable!
The film bumbles along bouncing from one stupid scene to another. A particular scene when Chris O'Dowds character loses his arm is laugh out loud absurdity. In fact it is O'Dowd who keeps this terrible film just about watchable. He has some funny dialogue and it's almost obvious that he knows he's in a real stinker of a movie and just decides to have some fun.There's an old saying ""You get what you pay for!""
That's why this movie was made available on Netflix right out of the blue.
Not even Hollywood studio executives would be cheeky enough to ask you to go out to the cinema and pay to see this steaming pile of S**t!",The Cloverfield Paradox

85,ericrnolan,"A short review of ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" (2018)",4,9 February 2018,"As you may have heard, there were two major surprises connected with ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" (2018). The first was its surprise release via Netflix on Sunday immediately after the Super Bowl. The second was the surprise that it was a truly mediocre movie. I can't actually recommend ""The Cloverfield Paradox,"" and I'd rate it a 4 out of 10.It's a mess. It's crowded with too many characters, cluttered with too many plot points, and seems like at least three movies crammed into one. The writing is lackluster -- and characters appear to have minimal reactions to things that should astound and terrify them. Much of my enjoyment was hampered by a bizarre and inexplicable plot point. (What was the deal with one crew member's arm?) And my mind was wandering toward the end. What's sad is this -- hidden within the film is the germ of a vastly better movie. Consider the plights faced by the characters played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Elizabeth Debicki, and the interaction between them. (I'm keeping things intentionally vague here to avoid spoilers.) How much better would this movie be if it was strictly about that subplot alone? With some skilled screenwriting, it could have been a beautifully tragic soft-sci-fi drama -- and it wouldn't require much in the way of special effects either. Both actresses were damned terrific here. Given a proper script and a feature-length exploration, they could have given us a new sci-fi classic. Oh, well -- file this movie under ""missed opportunities.""One more thing -- this actually does connect with the previous ""Cloverfield"" films, albeit in a surprising way. It's a result of the unusual story device that's emphasized in the movie's second half, and it's pretty neat. This is one of the things the movie gets right ... if you're still confused after the film is over, then google an explanation of it, as I did.",The Cloverfield Paradox
86,Mike_Devine,Probably the end of the 'Cloverfield' franchise,2,28 May 2018,"Coming a decade after J.J. Abram's original guerrilla sci-fi monster thriller, 2018's direct-to-Netflix film 'The Cloverfield Paradox' has struggled to find an audience on the platform. Billed as an unconventional pre/sequel, 'Paradox' explores the events that take place above Earth immediately preceding and during the disastrous havoc that is wreaked on New York City and elsewhere around the globe when alien monsters strike.Specifically, we follow the crew of the Cloverfield Station as they try to stave off a global energy crisis by generating a renewable energy source in the Shepard particle accelerator, an untested device that represents great risk with greater reward. Of course, it's not surprising that the use of this accelerator doesn't go exactly as planned, and instead the crew experience inexplicable, unspeakable things as a result.From a plot perspective, 'Paradox' is pretty weak. It pales in comparison with other space-set films, and it feels very disconnected from previous entries in the franchise (including '10 Cloverfield Lane,' which is loosely tied to begin with). Even the events in space feel like a completely separate movie from what is happening on the ground simultaneously. Even though things aren't supposed to make a whole lot of sense, they just seem ridiculous. Additionally, the cast is relatively unknown and fail to generate any real interest or sympathy. Gugu Mbatha-Raw and David Oyelowo make the biggest impact of anyone else, but even their performances are dragged down by the lack of quality of the film itself.It's sad to see how far this series has fallen, considering the two previous installments were hits with the general audience. 'The Cloverfield Paradox' proves why it skipped theaters, and likely marks the end of this franchise.",The Cloverfield Paradox

88,eberkerbatur,End of the CLOVERFIELD series.good series but bad movie,5,29 August 2018,"The series I started with the cloverfield movie is now over, I honestly say it was the worst movie in the series of three movies, even worse in the others.
The most interesting series I've seen because they are different from each other in the three movies and merge them together with only small pieces.I would like to pass on the cloverfield paradox.Actually the movie was very smooth and enjoying the viewing(my most positive thoughts about the movie)
:):)but it was a lot of ridiculous things, and certainly some events were no longer logical or even impossible for me, so I decided that it was a very ridiculous movie because there were more than one.There were a lot of things that I did not have in my mind I really wondered about some of the events.I liked it very much in the previous 2 movies but unfortunately I did not like it Movies were good but it was ridiculous, unreasonable and unrealistic I could not write a lot of comments about this movie because I tried to understand the events in many minutes and I always thought in my head that such a thing could be real.

89,Mcduff3601,Definitely the worst of the three movies out (so far),6,14 February 2018,"I can see why people hated this movie - there are so many things wrong with it. I was at home sick when I watched this so it caught my attention and I ended up somewhat enjoying it, but I am sure I am one of the few and with total justification.This whole thing felt like a made for tv horror/thriller. It was so washed out that nothing was really scary or tense. There was very little blood. There is one scene that is supposed to be a gross out classic horror shot that just ends up with a uhhhh ok wtf is going on which kind of killed the momentum. The little tension that is built up is killed by introducing questions you think will be answered. You will watch a scene and go ""WTF is happening - oh well just take it and we will get answers later on... those answers never come except with some really lame writing. Why is this happening...ughhh...""science?!""It kind of reminds me of the show LOST, it introduced questions all over the place and over time slowly answered them (maybe not to everyone's satisfaction). The movie answers nothing (except to say science did it) and feels like it leaves things open for more made for tv movies.The problem with introducing suspenseful mysterious questions is you want the audience to WANT answers. I found myself already knowing what happens in the first Cloverfield so you kind of know whats going on so there is no real mystery and the other questions it tries to introduce I found myself not really caring about getting answers and that is not a good way to build tension or mystery.I thought the premise was pretty cool, the acting was pretty good, the special effects were pretty on par. The story was just flat and uninteresting. But keeping the audience in the dark only goes so far, I know it worked well with the first two movies but not this one. I gave this movie a 6 because it entertained me in my hour of need but can see why people are giving it less.",The Cloverfield Paradox

It should have stayed that way, but by now it's clear that the creators want a ""Cloverfield - universe"" so they expand.In 'Paradox' a scientific team in space (sounds more corny than it is) experiments with new energy sources, while coping with missing their homes and each others differences. They were warned that their experiment doesn't just mess with life, but with reality itself and the horrible effects it might cause.Till that point it might have been a stand alone movie with decent acting, thrills and unexpected scares. Unfortunately the intelligent scientific part gets overruled by scare tactics and a plot twist that you see coming from miles away. From alfway the movie, it feels rushed into making something that connects to Cloverfield. That connection is there and it might work as a cause (or tie in) to Cloverfield.

91,Thrashman88,A Messy Story That's Spectacular To Watch,6,12 February 2018,"For a moment I thought THE CLOVERFIELD PARADOX was a sequel of sorts to CLOVERFIELD (2008). It appears that it is a sequel but through out the 90 plus minute movie I hardly noticed the connective tissue between the 2 films. THE CLOVERFIELD PARADOX has an intersting set up but I don't think it panned out successfully. There are traces to other sci-fi classics: ALIEN, EVENT HORIZON, DEEP IMPACT and even INTERSTELLAR, while never being superior to either one of these films. For a Netflix movie, the production rivals anything done by Hollywood and that's a good thing because a direct to streaming movie reminded me of those awful 80s and 90s movies that were done direct to video. I'm glad to report this isn't the case by a long shot. 
Still, the story feels contrived and the develpment of characters very, very shallow. There's no attachment to any of them so when something nasty happens, you don't feel a thing. Being a JJ Abrams production I would expect a bit more.
It was nice to hear Bear McCreary´s (OUTLANDER, THE WALKING DEAD) rousing musical score, one of the highlights of the movie.I'm sure Netflix will hone their movie making skills in the near future. For now, THE CLOVERFIELD PARADOX falls short in delivering an above average Sci-Fi thriller.",The Cloverfield Paradox
92,themadmovieman,"Cloverfield on a larger scale, but still just as thrilling and riveting",8,5 February 2018,"Another unexpected link to the Cloverfield Universe, The Cloverfield Paradox is yet another brilliant, intense, mysterious and intelligent addition to the series. Although it features the same sort of unsettling mystery as Cloverfield and 10 Cloverfield Lane, this film is a much larger-scale, action-packed extravaganza, all the while featuring yet another enthralling, unpredictable story that will have you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.Let's start off with what sets this apart from the series. Cloverfield was a found-footage monster movie, while 10 Cloverfield Lane was a claustrophobic mystery-thriller. This time, it's a big, outer space action sci-fi, taking place on a much bigger scale than any of the films before it.In that, there are some of the most impressive visuals of any Cloverfield movie, with vistas of outer space on a similar level to the likes of Gravity, while the film as a whole features a far more breakneck pace than either of its predecessors, all of which make it a massively entertaining watch from start to finish.Combine that new large-scale action with the typical brains, twists, mystery and unpredictability of previous Cloverfield movies, and you have what is easily the most accessible film of the series. I won't spoil anything, but the plot here is an excellent combination of outlandish sci-fi thrills and spills with the intense claustrophobia that 10 Cloverfield Lane pulled off so well.As a result, you can watch this film in more ways than one. It's an entertaining and massively exciting sci-fi blockbuster, but you can scale things down and watch it as yet another claustrophobic, character-driven thriller, which is what really made the film so good for me.From the film's very opening, there's a distinct air of tension between the scientists on board the space station, setting up the premise for a darker drama in which suspicion runs rife within the small crew from seven different countries.So, along with the massive action and sci-fi thrills, there's still real depth and intelligence to the dramatic story, centring on Gugu Mbatha-Raw's character, and offering up something that's just as emotionally riveting as it is an exciting sci-fi blockbuster, taking the film to another level, and making it truly worth the watch.While we're talking about Mbatha-Raw, she puts in an excellent lead performance. Likable, convincing and very strong on screen, she makes her rather down-to-earth character a riveting watch while up in space, and holds her own alongside her fellow all-star cast, with the likes of Daniel Brühl, Zhang Ziyi, David Oyelowo and Chris O'Dowd all bringing a fantastic range of characters and personalities to the crew on board, with just enough contrasts to keep that interpersonal tension brewing strongly throughout.So, with great performances, brilliant visuals, excellent action and sci-fi thrills, and a dramatic story to boot, The Cloverfield Paradox proves yet another fantastic addition to this mysterious franchise, furthered by a subtle but consistently exciting atmosphere that promises to link into the wider 'Cloververse', and provide answers to some of its greatest mysteries.I really enjoyed this film, but if I were to have any complaints, I would say that it's the most structurally orthodox and basic film of the franchise. Cloverfield's found-footage usage made it brilliantly unique, while spending almost the entirety of 10 Cloverfield Lane in an underground bunker made it an exceptionally claustrophobic and intense thriller.The Cloverfield Paradox, on the other hand, could be more easily lumped in with the overall 'sci-fi' genre, given how similar it feels at times to the likes of Life, Alien and Prometheus. With the exception of its darker thrills and insane action and ideas, there is something a little more generic and simple about this film, which meant I wasn't quite as blown away or deeply intrigued as I have been in the previous two Cloverfield movies.Overall, however, The Cloverfield Paradox is yet another brilliantly unexpected delight to add to the series. It's got brains and depth alongside its larger-scale action and sci-fi exploits, while a deeper sense of mystery alongside a wide range of great performances keeps good tension bubbling throughout.",The Cloverfield Paradox
93,WalkdenEntertainment,The Weakest one out of the 3 films...,5,10 January 2019,"Introducing the third Cloverfield film, which is a new story set in the same ""Cloverfield Universe"". I must confess I was rather excited once I heard about the unexpected announcement from Netflix that both the trailer and the actual full feature instalment would appear on Netflix- no one saw it coming.While earth is at the edge of war, a group of skilled scientists go to space to test a new device in order to try and solve an energy crisis. Needless to say the crew soon discover a new dark and creepy alternate reality.Cloverfield Paradox looks colourful and sounds amazing. I enjoyed how the film is more focused on a sci-fi aspect (most of the film's duration occurs on a space ship), but also took risks within the film's plots and with its characters. While everything about the 'Cloverfield world' is enjoyable, the movie's overall plot and story feels rather messy and somewhat lazy. Without going into spoilers, Cloverfield Pardox tries to answer the burning questions we've all had from the last two films, but in doing so... it raises even more questions! In fact, the film raised so many questions that as the credits rolled, it left me feeling rather confused. For Cloverfield fans, this can also feel rather annoying after there was so much hype and excitement from the film's announcement.Our characters are wasted. While many actors will seem familiar from other films, the dialogue and writing that surrounds them feel rather messy and at times, cheesy. Even while characters are suffering, the film seems to pick or choose when our leads are sad, or whether they instead make a joke which falls flat. The characters are never constant and because of that, they also become predictable.Overall, Cloverfield Paradox had so much hype and excited but its end results are disappointing, particularly personally as a fan of the franchise. The plot and story affect the positive feelings for the previous instalments and the film has many disappointing character moments. The film could have been so much more. Instead, the film will leave many confused and possibly annoyed. This third instalment is easily the weakest out of the three.5.0/10

96,austin0731,"Does not live up to the other films in the 'Clover field universe', average sci-fi horror",6,15 April 2018,"The Cloverfield Paradox is the third installment in the Cloverfield franchise that has garnered a cult following that has been growing ever since the initial Cloverfield movie. What started as a mysterious found footage film haas now blown up into a potential film franchise with installments such as 10 Cloverfield lane that received both critical audience acclaim. So how does the next instalment fair? Well, having this film being released on Netflix certainly isn't a good sign, while this doesn't represent a film set to fail, it definitely gives audiences an anti climactic aura surrounding the release. Perhaps the sudden dropping announcement during the super bowl might add some excitement, helping this film live up to its predecessors. The film itself was fine, the characters play highly stereotypical representations of the country they represent with little character development and poorly written dialogue. Not to mention a personal issue of mine, the awkward language barrier that only seems to exist with the chinese character, it was just something that put me off. However, character development side, I thought the film poses very interesting ideas, while never fully explained I enjoyed the suspense and sense of mystery the film presents in the various scenes depicting the effects of having the two dimensions clash. But having interesting ideas of course cannot carry a film, and because of this the film definitely is lacking, this perhaps is why the producers decided to release it early on Netflix and without prior notice. Another issue of this film is that they sort of shoe horn in the remainder of the universe in a very in the face way, I always appreciated that while all the films are set in the same universe there is a very loose tie and this sense of mystery is what makes a large part of the franchise's success. Because we are unable to ever understand fully what the reasons behind all these issues are the intrigue creates a much better mystery. Not only does Paradox introduce the rest of the universe in an in your face way it also does so in a very lackluster way, with seemingly little care.

If we look back, obviously, the first one was a found footage style monster horror film, two was a psychological thriller and now we have a space action sci-fi film. Personally, Alien is pretty much my only favourite space horror film, like found footage and spoof, it has also been done to death, anywho, Cloverfield Paradox (which I'm just gonna call Cloverfield 3) is about a group of people who go to space to try and build up as much energy as they can back to Earth after a lot is lost (??) and they haft to bring more down to save it, but sadly, the crew are then swept away into another dimension. This film is...weird. Although the film may have only been out for 2 days, fans still have not gotten there head around that weird ass ending, the ending to me is just messed up, the only way I'm going to be able to explain the ending is if I spoil it so please just leave if so and skip a few lines, the ending shows the German man and the main lead lady who go back down to Earth being the only survivors, when they go down through the clouds everything seems to be fine, when it cuts to the girls husband who pleeds the man on the phone not to bring her back, why? Oh well because then the film ends with the god damn Cloverfield monster jumping into the sky..?? This ending is really weird, they're are actually millions of theories, was it that thing that flew from the sky at the end of the first film which supposidly woke the monster, like..WHAT??!! Apparently though, Reeves confirmed already what that thing was was that flew from the sky was actually a bunch of Tagruato submarines sent down from Chuai Station to investigate..mh. I don't know guys I actually do not know, the film also did not connect at all to the second film, did it? I doubt it, ugh! Cloverfield Paradox is an ok film but definitly leaves more questions then answers, stay tuned for my review hopefully on Saturday for Insidious: The Last Key, but don't worry, I'll still have more afterwards!",The Cloverfield Paradox
99,jackgdemoss,The audience members rating this poorly seem to believe a good film that is also layered and confusing is a paradox in itself,8,16 June 2018,"Unfortunately, at the time of writing this review, I have yet to see the other Cloverfield films. That did not stop me from enjoying this piece of work. A sci-fi film that is complicated, even to a fault at times. It will keep you guessing until the end. What I was most impressed with was how it was released without any warning, and sent straight to Netflix. The spoiler tag is to reveal a weak spot of mine, which is a twist ending that leaves the audience with a sense of dread. This movie does that, and probably received a higher rating from me because of it.",The Cloverfield Paradox
100,Gresh854,A Dissapointing And Laughable Entry In The Fabulous Cloverfield Universe,2,27 February 2018,"The Cloverfield Paradox fails in almost every aspect. The two main cons I think that really killed this film where it's lazy storytelling, and poor scriptwriting. When it's trying to be original it just comes off as extremely messy, and when it's not being messy, it's just being completely generic.Final Verdict: D",The Cloverfield Paradox
101,Lewis_Heather787,"Huge potential , a lot of good elements but execution is a little messy!",6,5 February 2018,"Positives Directing, acting, production design and special effects are all really decent in the film. All pretty good for the most part nothing of note that standouts out but really solid throughout so no faults in these areas. It stands up against other Sci-Fi films with far larger budgets very well and still keeps the Cloverfield ""vibe"" whilst still trying to expand and deepen the material.Gugu Mbatha-Raw is good in the lead of the film even though her character may initially not be the lead of the crew, her character works well setting an emotional heart beat to the film. All the other actors in the film have good chemistry throughout whether it was through joy or adversity, there is a really good team dynamic on the space craft. A special shoutout should go to Chris O'Dowd who was brilliantly funny throughout the film bringing fantastic levity to scenes, nice to see him in a different type of role.For what this film is the special effects of the space craft and certain set pieces towards the end of the film are nicely shot and crafted. Even though ,as eluded to earlier, this film doesn't have an enormous budget it uses the CGI to the best effect and not too much.NegativesThis film, now I could be mistaken, has the word ""Cloverfield"" in the title does it not, and is supposedly the third entry in the very loosely connected Cloverfield franchise. To say loosely connected is putting it lightly because watching the three films so far in the franchise there is not much connective tissue, and even where there is some it is not executed very well. The first ""Cloverfield"" film is..............good i think I cant remember to save my life.....erm... I do remember ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" which I personally thought was a good small contained thriller. This film ""Paradox"" is the strangest so far for a number of reasons. Ambiguity is fantastic in films personally I love a film that doesn't answer all the question or brings up more questions than answers. This film tries to do that in a really messy way and too many times, there are certain things that happen throughout the film that make no sense, don't progress the film or add anything and they are never mentioned again?? Chris O'Dowd character dying, the magnets??? How? Why? Im not missing something am I? Also the timeline of the film in the franchise, when does this take place?? The monster at the end is far bigger than the one in the first cloverfield film so... is it set after??? Or do they end up on an alternate earth?? So confusing??Overall this film is OK its 65% out of 100 or 6.5 out of 10 there is nothing remarkable about the film however there are some good elements being directing, acting and special effects. However the film tries to do a lot in a small amount of time at an extremely fast pace whilst posing questions that make little sense that don't connect that well with the ""franchise"". Im probably in the minority about this film and it will probably be very divisive?? Id give it a watch but its nothing special a fine entry but not as good as the previous two films!",The Cloverfield Paradox

104,scb_coldsteel,No....just no,5,1 October 2018,"So I just finished the new Netflix movie The Cloverfield Paradox. This of course being the third film in JJ Abrams Cloverfield series. I must give it to Netflix it was a genius marketing campaign. Premiering the trailer during the Super Bowl and also announcing it was available to stream at the end of the Super Bowl. It definitely helped build up hype.Unfortunately the movie as a whole was easily the weakest in the Cloverfield series. There is literally not a single original idea in this movie. It felt like someone set down binge watched a lot of 80s and 90s Scfi and decided to write a movie. The movie was absolutely packed to the brim full of predictable tropes and tired cliches.While the movie started with promise, slowly building intrigue it completely fell off at the halfway point. Unfortunately the movie used a flimsy excuse of alternate dimensions to cover up a lack of plot development. Why is that happening it, doesn't make sense you may say, we'll it is an alternate dimension deal with it...lazy writing. The film also attempted to bridge the gaps between the previous to Cloverfield films, but this felt more like an afterthought than a actual component of the plot.On one strong note I did enjoy the cast. Daniel Brühl is one of my favorite German actors and who doesn't love Chris O'Dowd. Now this all being said, it was not a terrible film, just extremely lazy. I certainly did enjoy some aspects of the film and was genuinely intrigued by some of the mystery.

There were plummy British accents that just didn't belong there and awful dialogue in whatever accent.
I actually got quite angry because for the most part all there was was people shouting at each other at every opportunity. I mean these are supposed to be scientists and professionals at the peak of their abilities but they argue and fight and shout like kids in a playground.

There is no tie in with the other two films and there is little to no explanation about the events taking place.The acting is good. Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Daniel Bruhl, and Roger Davis all perform well. David Oyelowo and Chris O'Dowd give the best performances. Elizabeth Debricki gives the worst performance as a bland, lifeless, and bricklike survivor.The runtime is overlong and the pacing is slow. The editing is also weird in some spots.The CGI is very good throughout the film.Pros: Good CGI and great performances by David Oyelowo and Chris O'DowdCons: Weak story, no tie ins with the other films, bad performance by Elizabeth Debricki, overlong runtime, slow pacing and weird editingOverall Rating: 4.4This film reminds me of the 2014 Godzilla movie.

112,lnvicta,Mediocre sci-fi horror with the Cloverfield brand tacked on.,4,16 February 2018,"Remember ""Life"", the recent sci-fi horror ""Alien"" knockoff with a great cast that couldn't compete with its sterile script? ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" is this year's ""Life"", except worse.I'm a sucker for sci-fi horror, so despite the bad reviews I went into this movie with an open mind. Truthfully, it's not terrible, mostly due to the cast. There isn't a weak link in the acting department. No matter how trite or cliché the dialogue is, they deliver it with the necessary gravitas. Sadly, this is a sci-fi horror film, so the bulk of the film's effectiveness lies with the scares. And that's where this movie fails. There was not a single decent scare or even an attempt at building suspense. There could have been tension had the location been bottled in the space station, but the movie cuts to and from an Earth storyline that has absolutely no bearing on the plot whatsoever. The movie itself makes no sense. It takes a page out of the ""Event Horizon"" book with the alternate dimensions and whatnot, which is a cool premise. The problem is that as soon as things go awry, the rulebook goes out the window. Things just happen because why the hell not. Chris O'Dowd's arm gets cut off and begins to write a message on its own. Some guy starts convulsing and worms burst out of his face. A stranger suddenly materializes inside one of the space station's walls. ""Why?"" is a valid question to all of these statements, but the movie has no intention of explaining anything.Then there's the Cloverfield aspect, which is clearly just tacked on at the end to capitalize on the name. Again, aside from the dedicated cast and some admittedly cool looking deaths, ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" brings nothing new or interesting to the genre. It's yet another ""Alien"" derivation with even less to say than the films that came before it.",The Cloverfield Paradox
113,NerdBat,Very interesting.,7,5 February 2018,"It was almost like they were trying to incorporate the story of the Philadelphia project into the movie. If you don't know what that is, I recommend researching, it's very interesting. The movie certainly makes you use your brain, and really kept my attention throughout. Not really any boring parts, that's always a plus. Hate to break it to you though, you won't see hardly any of the monster until the very end. However, other aspects of the movie almost make up for it, in the fact that it does pretty much explain everything that happened, and fits in as a prequel pretty well compared to other movie franchises.

Cloverfield Paradox, on the other hand, is a unique treatment full of incoherent aspects.The movie tries to give an explanation to the previous ones, however, like Ridley Scott's curse with Aliens, each movie has only ended up confusing us even more. They try to enter the paradoxical field however they fall short with the revelations of the answers or the solved mysteries, being simpler representations of Question A with Question B, without making clear the true reason or logic behind it. Maybe his point was to try to give a kind of Cosmic Horror sensation, but that's not how it works, a genre which is very difficult to make for the big screen by the way, on the other hand, in how many positive aspects of Cloverfield Paradox I can mention that it has some really disturbing scenes and decent and convincing performances on the part of the actors, with a good relationship between them and the characters. Even so, this movie ended up being just a mixed attempt to be revealing, of course was something very surprising his announcement to the world, but ended up falling short of expectations. It just ended up being a decent movie, with nothing really great about it, and also very confusing if we want to relate it to Cloverfield's past movies.",The Cloverfield Paradox
127,Eric_Cubed,"Far, far better than anything you have heard.",6,6 January 2021,"I can't figure out how this Cloverfield segment is so godawful. Every single one of the top critics despised it and gave it a universal thumbs down. Yet, when the majority of critics, top or not, has an extreme reaction to a film, negative or not, I wonder if that in and of itself makes the movie redeemable or at least not subjectable to comprehensive and competent review. Imagine, putting that much vitriol and agitated energy into it. It struck a chord. It made a mark. And it bunched everyone's panties. I enjoyed Cloverfield Paradox to the very end, as much as I enjoyed the better Star Trek films. It's a story in a timeline, a prequel explaining how dimensions were opened up and how creatures were let into our world. And even better, it illuminates the parallel Earth and how when the dimensions collided how the characters were affected. It is not a great movie, but it's way better than that latest Kirstin Steward film about defeating an underwater monster, though the two of these films share the same basic problems, which is a deficit in continuity. Leaving the audience guessing is dish that is best served cold, not prattled with many hotpots overflowing which creates confused perceptions. The actors are great and some of them top notch. The special effects and cinematography is excellent. The staging, directing and bringing it all together into a cohesive whole is adequate because one suspends disbelief while watching the entire film. Trust, I know what this means. I recently returned an OLED TV because I could see the pores leaping from Aaron Eckhart's face as he explained to Batman why he was now Two-Faced. This tech makes movies look like soap operas, or when you look at the extras, the film being filmed, without proper lighting, etc. I can't understand how the creators of movies can stand this. It is horrible. It looks like a janitor from the nineties filmed everything after everyone else left the set. I can't understand this. How are you able to stand it? It's awful. Now I'm a 1500 richer and watching my favorite movies on a computer connected to a large monitor. It's great, just as the movies should be, not as a perfect reflection of life, but as a vision from the creators who work so hard to give us an escape, which doesn't include seeing the skeleton vines of every leaf in the scene. I watched the beginning of The Shining with OLED. The camera above illuminated every detail, which made me know at every moment I was watching a film instead of stepping into an immersing experience that respected the subjective over the objective. We are missing magic. Not primitive, superstitious magic, but magic that the film industry has given us, with Steven Spielberg the greatest at delivering it. I am sure many of you do not understand, but for film, this is profoundly important, because the new tech threatens to destroy the magic I am speaking of, a tv, movie screen or online show to absorb our attention into it so we don't have to think too much about our problems. This is impossible with OLED and QLED. Immediately you will know you are watching something that cannot transport you anywhere. It is awful and it is insane. Let us all make a stand now.",The Cloverfield Paradox
128,tmpsvita,"Not original or at the same level of the first two, but it's entertaining and engaging",7,7 February 2018,"Third chapter of the saga produced by J.J. Abrams that was inaugurated in 2008 by the lucky ""Cloverfield"", a saga that with the second surprising chapter seemed to be more thematic or ideological than narrative but with this new film returns, clarifying some things, to be a ""standard"" saga.
Announced as a surprise during the Super Bowl a few days ago with a rather interesting teaser, the film had immediately caught my attention and that of all the fans of ""Cloverfield"", of Netflix users and of science fiction lovers in general, film genre belonging to all three films that is, however, exploited in a completely different way in each of them: if the first is presented as a found footage science fiction, the second ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is more a thriller with some element linked to the science fiction, while this ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" has a much more horror look with a totally sci-fi environment, that is, space.
Unlike the other two, widely appreciated by both critics and public, this has received numerous negative opinions especially from the critics but also the public seems not to have liked particularly perhaps because of too high expectations, generated both by the quality of the two previous films that from the mysterious marketing campaign of the latter.
Honestly I agree only with a few of the criticisms that have been attributed, in fact, I found it in the end a pleasant vision that offers the viewer a good dose of entertainment, supported in large part by a remarkable soundtrack capable to create a very disturbing atmosphere in some places, spectacular in others and always engaging; the rhythm is definitely another point in favor of the film, smeared in a functional and intelligent way during its duration.
The horror component works quite well as that science fiction, thanks to the discrete sets and special effects all in all in the average production of this scale and above all with a relatively low budget behind it, in this case is around 26 million dollars ( data taken from IMDb).
The story tries to act as a bridge between the first two, apparently disconnected, with the aim of linking all three stories; the final result, from this point of view, is, however, only half successful. The film tries to plug some of the many question marks in the saga but does so through a script that is not entirely convincing, and this produces an almost opposite effect because if it is true that something has been explained, other aspects (most) have remained without explanations and more new doubts and new questions have arisen.
I did not like at all the initial part in which the film tries to transport the viewer within the context in which the film takes place, through various misguided explanations, thus being irritating.
In addition, various dialogues do not work as they should, there are also some inconsistencies and screenwriting holes.
But I liked the comic times pretty much and practically all the characters, despite their characterization is not exceptional it is easy to be able to feel empathy towards them. Probably thanks to the excellent interpretations among which stands out that of the protagonist, very credible and convincing.
Many have also criticized the lack of originality, and in fact this is present, in fact it is not the first time that the theme of the paradox, the various temporal space dimensions and the collision between them is treated, even the horror genre in space is not a new thing, but what however differs me from fully sharing these criticisms is the way in which the film deals with all these things and how it reworks / rereads them.
Like the other two, even the ending of this third reserve of beautiful surprises, in this case is also particularly surprising on a visual level.

This means the odd transpositions onboard as well as the attacks from the first and second movie are tied together due to this same event across different realities.Very nice casting and acting from all involved.

As a fan of the prequel ""Cloverfield Lane"", which I thought was a brilliant movie, (not so much ""Cloverfield"", which was the first installment in the franchise) I had to watch the third Cloverfield movie. What I noticed right at the beginning was that Hamilton was the ""actual"" protagonist. Meaning, that she was the only character who was properly introduced to us. Once on the space ship we're made to witness what I could only describe as a ""forced conflict"" between Volkov and Schmidt. It just didn't seem natural to me, their behavior that is. It was quite out of place.In terms of cinematography the movie has a lot to offer. I mean, it looks very nice which can be mostly attributed to the impressive color grading.The story itself isn't all that bad. With a cast this strong it should come to no surprise that the acting performances were quite good. One minor detail that irked me about the movie was the scene with the 3D printer. While 3D printing a gun is possible in theory it's not that simple. First off you'd need a plan / 3D model which I'm sure is not something that was available to the crew members. Furthermore it takes a considerable amount of time to print things with a traditional 3D printer; we're talking hours upon hours of ""printing"". The thing with the autonomous arm was beyond goofy. Not to mention that it's a physical impossibility due to the laws of thermodynamics.
HD live streams over the distance of many astronomical units... that's also an impossibility, as anyone who knows anything about space travel will know. Just ask the astronauts on the ISS how fast their internet connection is (and keep in mind that they're not even that far away; in the earth's gravitational orbit).Another thing that I found quite illogical was the fact that all of the crew members spoke Mandarin. It's not like ""Chinese"" is the most commonly spoken language by non-native speakers. So that was a little bit confusing. The pacing was quite slow even though more and more SNAFU's kept happening every now and then. Catastrophe elements should be used sparsely, kind of like a joke; if you use the same joke over and over again it'll seize to be funny. Well, that's kind of where this movie has lost the mark. Everything that could somehow go wrong goes wrong. So much so that we as the viewers are already seeing multiple steps ahead, theorizing the next SNAFU. With that being said the movie had overstayed its welcome. Certain scenes were twice as long as they needed to be and felt painful to watch as a result of it. It was kind of a drag.There were some casualties in the movie but unfortunately they didn't affect me at all. The characters were just too generic for me to care. The only character with some back story is Hamilton. I think that's pretty bad, storytelling-wise. In order to make a story and the characters in it matter to the viewer the characters have to be properly introduced.The ending didn't really surprise anyone. If you've seen the two prequels you knew how this movie is going to end. So I guess it was to be expected.Final conclusion: After having seen the movie I can definitely understand some of the frustrations that people had with it. It is however not as bad as most people made it out to be. Yes, it is weak in the storytelling department but it does have some impressive visuals and is unique enough.Final verdict: watchable",The Cloverfield Paradox
133,thisseatofmars,The ending may throw you for a loop if you haven't seen the original.,5,5 February 2018,"I liked the original ""Cloverfield"" because a.) I love giant monsters and b.) I love found footage movies. This is the third Cloverfield movie and it doesn't really have either. ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" feels more like a space-thriller sort of a thing, like Alien minus the Alien. Which is a shame. I never know now if Cloverfield's going to offer me monsters, scares, or spies. What, spies? Yeah. As the movie progresses there's talk of espionage, war, information gathering, blah-blah-blah. I got a James Bond sort of feel from ""Paradox"" in parts, what with the espionage and all the British accents.Plot: a tokenly diverse crew of astronauts (thumbs up for the comic relief Irishman) head up to space to test what's basically the hadron collider, but in switching it on they create a wormhole/tear in the spacetime continuum/alternate reality/big mess, causing general confusion and the Cloverfield monster to fall to Earth. But we see so little of the monster, and that's disappointing. Instead, most of the movie is the crew running around their little tinpot ship and gasping along with the musical stings. Instead of dealing with the monster they contend with the ship malfunctioning and each other. Yawn. (I have insomnia tonight, by the way. It's 4:03AM as I write this.)When you hear Clover, or Cloverfield, you think of the titular monster, not a space station void of creepy-cool monsters. We do have glimpses of the creature, and I liked the ending, but this film would've been stronger if it capitalized on the mystique of the ""creatures from the alternate dimensions,"" the Cloverfield monster included.That said, I can see where the filmmakers are going with the Cloverfield series. The original idea for the Halloween movies was to have each installment be a self-contained story; that's why Halloween II doesn't feature Mike Myers. I think these guys are doing kind of the same thing with this. The original Cloverfield was found footage and giant monsters. The third movie is a space thriller. The second movie had you locked in a basement with John Goodman... (*shiver*).",The Cloverfield Paradox
134,ijameson,Ok acting with bad dialogue,4,7 February 2018,"This was a movie that made little sense.Why things happened on the station were never really explained. And the dialogue ... ""they overloaded the Higgs Boson"". Really?And there were scenes where they had to hurray to save everyone's life, then they stopped to think, or chat. Who does that?And no scientist stops to make a prayer before an experiment. 
The contempt one of the other scientists has for that was probably the most realistic part of the movie.***Minor Spoilers ***It takes years for the accelerator to work, then it catches on fire, and then they get it to work first time they need it to get home.

A paradox, even though there is chaos in a paradox that chaos has laws of nature to contend to. The writers failed to see this actual reality and did not deliver to the intelligence of the audience instead they think we are idiots. The actors did amazing! They did Great! I think some jewish guy wanted to laugh at someones christian ideology and created this ending and it was foolish. If demons where to actually come out on earth they would look like that, Demons are shapeshifters and they can look like human beings or an object if need be just like the demons that where once angels in heaven where shape shifted into objects in heaven like a gate or a footstool, that was their design because they didn't eat, crap, drink or sleep. God designed these angels as shape shifting objects and the demons that are without form or intelligence is because they didn't have a job like an archangel where intelligence was required hence why demons are formless and are seen in horror without shape. You see once you understand whats in front of you then you can finally calm down and make proper non horrifying choices and show compassion to whats in front of you just like God shows compassion on us! Yes we are horrifying creatures and some think we are actually the demons of the bible. There I just created a story close to reality and it wasn't that hard, I do not know how writers can be so limited in imagination and tie that into reality instead they create negativity, racism, and war and not some unique ending that helps humanity think instead they only get 5 stars.",The Cloverfield Paradox

While the Russian, French and German all used English as their communication language, I totally see no point using Chinese as another communication language in space. And that's perverse, that everyone there seemed to understand it. That's an insult to global audiences.Energy test in space went wrong, had been to another dimension and eventually went back to home with a monster/monsters. Ok that's easily predicted n that's cliché. No problem, I dig the concept. But that concept is not even close as a Cloverfield prequel!!Entertaining? Hell nope. Excitement? Nope.

137,seige-hound,A Severe Letdown,4,25 February 2018,"10 Cloverfield Lane was a fantastic film. The original Cloverfield I haven't seen in a fair while, but I remember it being alright for a found footage movie.This movie was a mess, though.It had some interesting ideas, but it failed to stick the landing. I actually find the idea of a horror film where a science experiment breaks physics and causes a whole bunch of weird s**t to happen. The premise would work well as a horror-comedy of sorts, especially with the ridiculousness of things like a person's arm coming off and gaining sentience.However, what happens instead is a series of events that have little to no actual connecting thread. A lot of the story is contrived and the ending is boring. They use the excuse that because of the 'Cloverfield Paradox' that the film is named after, they can kill characters and change motivations randomly without any further explanation. The film also fails to properly explain its connection to the other films, which were already flimsy in the first place. If the films were a part of a loosely connected anthology series with no official canon connection with each other, that would be fine, but instead, they're trying to build an entire brand off taking entirely separate and unrelated screenplays and turning them into franchise movies by only making a few changes.I actually liked the marketing tactic of releasing the film straight to Netflix the same day it was announced. Releasing a film that way is pretty bold, but also can be interpreted as the studio having no real faith in the film to succeed, so they instead sold the rights to Netflix and pushed their poor marketing as a gimmick.Overall, not worth watching unless you want another boring Space Horror film.",The Cloverfield Paradox

139,fairlesssam,An excellent mystery Sci-Fi,9,11 February 2018,"There has been a lot of negativity around this movie. I had absolutely no preconceived ideas or expectations apart from the negativity.I was pleasantly surprised and thought it was a refreshingly original and very exciting movie. There are elements of many films such as Event Horizon and Solaris but not in the way of using stuff already done, just an air of the feeling those movies gave you - dread.It's many thing including exciting, thrilling, sad and haunting. I found it to be a roller-coaster ride of science fiction mastery.The crew are up on a space station, trying to create a stable energy source for earth. After an initial successful attempt the accelerator shuts down but not before it has created a paradox. Different dimensions begin to merge causing catastrophic and inexplicable events most of which are terrifying.Other than what is happening up on the space station the other part of the main story line focuses on crew member Ava Hamilton, her relationship with her husband and her two children. The paradox puts her in a difficult position. The story has a few gaps here and there that could have been moulded together better but that's the same with the whole franchise. I think imagination is needed to develop the Cloverfield world how you want to.Overall it's a great cast, superb effects, it has originality and is quite breathtaking .",The Cloverfield Paradox
140,movieliker1,Entertaining but . . .,6,16 April 2021,"I like Science Fiction. And inspite of the obvious drawbacks, I found this movie entertaining. But . . .My biggest complaint is it's extremely over acted. Real astronauts are highly trained, and goal and process oriented. They know ""going in"" their jobs are dangerous and risky. They don't flip out, scream, yell, and cry everytime things don't go as planned. This crew does it virtually the whole movie.Secondly, apparently in the future, space crews aren't selected based on merit. They are chosen based on nationality, race and sex. There is a British scientist, a German, a Brazilian, a Russian, a Chinese scientist, an Irish technician and an American. Two blacks, two whites, an Hispanic and an Oriental. Five men and two women. (Wait, no gay person ??) This is not a routine mission. This is THE mission to save the Earth. These are best of the best?When Tam (the Chinese scientist) dies, her compartment fills with water, forcing pressure to break the seal on the outer hatch, causing the water to freeze immediately, killing her --- immediately.First of all, water doesn't freeze in outer space. It boils. Secondly, if it did, it wouldn't freeze that fast. Thirdly, even if it did freeze, it wouldn't kill her immediately.When she does freeze, the crew goes from having another over emotional hissy fit, to calmly discussing their next move having nothing to do with Tam.They just spent a half an hour dissecting a complete stranger impailed in a wall with cables and wires, and bringing her back to complete functionality. And now they are just going to abandon a beloved crew member? That doesn't make any sense.When three crew members decide to separate a damaged part of the space station from the viable part, they are moving, jumping and falling like there is gravity. There is no gravity in outer space. They couldn't move, jump and fall like that. We've seen it a million times during real space walks.You would think with all the time and money spent making movies, they would get these things straight. They wouldn't even have to hire a science consultant. All of this is available on the Internet.",The Cloverfield Paradox
141,BibChr,"Intriguing and complex plot, undone by main character and holes",7,7 February 2018,"Aware of many bad responses to the movie, I watched, ready to make up my own mind. I often like movies better than louder complainers do, and thought this might be such a case.From the very start, I was puzzled at the focus. It was this woman, Hamilton (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). She seemed vague, indefinite, not-quite-there, and uninteresting. In a scene with two people, she was the least interesting.I continued to be puzzled as she continued to be the focus. Here now is a team of actors/characters. As we get to know them, every last one of them is more interesting than she is. Yet she continues to be the focus. Is she destined to become interesting?No, not at all. Yes, she's destined to be the pivotal character...but she never becomes interesting. She never becomes compelling, likable, sympathetic -- definite. She stares, mopes, looks sad and confused and distracted. That's about it. She's the worst thing about the movie and, unfortunately, she's a major focus of the movie.Which is a real shame, because the plot (and all the other characters!) is really interesting and complex. I love when a situation unfolds in unexpected ways, and this is just such a plot. The plot (despite Hamilton) kept me interested.But even there, it ran into foolish holes and gaps. So, the ship hates them, right? It kills at least two of them. Why? Not sure. And REALLY not sure, because the ship seemingly loses interest in them after the last person it kills, and allows all the rest of the story to unfold, leaving the crew unmolested.And another thing. Our Heroine runs back at the end, seeing two team-members in jeopardy. To save them? No, not at all. Basically she gets there in time to watch the second get shot and struggle with Jensen. So does she join in and help him? Does she grab the gun and shoot Jensen? Does she do anything useful?No, she runs away and leaves him to be shot again. Ah, but surely she's running away to do something meaningful and important, something that explains why she ran back? Right?No, not at all. She just runs and hides. Why? She has no useful skills. Oh well.And then Jensen, stalking this useless UNARMED person, tiptoes around as if she's either a threat, or dearly-beloved. Which is it? Neither! Hamilton has NO weapon (doesn't look for one), and NO skills -- and, when Jensen can, she tries to kill her. So why the cat-and-mouse?See, this is one of those situations where I feel like the writers/director needed to bring a couple of people off the street, run the story past them, get some common-sense input...and then make a GREAT movie.Instead, they simply made an uneven movie: part great, part stupid.And even the ending, while arresting, is very, very unsatisfying.Could have been great.

So, here we have the second ""sequel"" and it's equally silly. (Seriously, was it that hard to generate sequels related to the original?)If you care to enjoy this film, even as a badfilm worthy of a night of cheap beer, you absolutely must skip past the first 20 minutes. It is here where they set everything up, and it's so ridiculous that it makes watching the rest of the film difficult. The premise has to do with the Earth ""running out of energy"", so we send a bunch of crazed scientists to space to perform some vague experiment that is likely to rip open the space/time continuum; which (oh no, spoiler!) it does. From here on out, I kept scratching my head and saying to myself things like ""well, if they didn't send these looneys up there, things might be fine"" and ""wait, so all the other issues on Earth weren't enough concern? it took a vague energy crisis to make them launch these clowns into space?""

143,cheighlee,Mystery Box is full of not so fantastic things,5,5 February 2018,"First Cloverfield movie was fun, despite the shakiest shaky cam ever, some nice parts, some not so, but all in all, a fine movie.Second Cloverfield movie was great, from the start to finish.This, the third Cloverfield movie, is mostly disappointing, plot wise. Acting was fine, effects were 99% ok, camera is okay, music as well. But everything else, tempo, story, script is pure predictableness and cliche. Not to mention bunch of bad plot choices. Premise is fine, but the execution is painfully predictable by the numbers, that you have to wonder were they at the gunpoint to make this?I think in a sense they were - they were at the gunpoint of time, and the ""golden"" moment is rapidly escaping. Let me explain briefly my take on this. First movie happens, people like it, everything's cool. Second movie gets made, someone thinks it could be tied with Cloverfield somehow. Even if the studio and JJ Abrams won't admit it, I'm 99% sure they made that decision post production. Why? Well cinematic universes are all the rage now and you have to bank on it.
Anyway, Cloverfield Lane is now, well - Cloverfield Lane, people were ok with it. So now we have one movie, and the other slapped onto first one. Now is the time for payoff, to bank on that cinematic universe money and this time purposefully make a third, shared movie that ties it all. But here's comes Abram's ""mystery box"", as usual, they don't know how to tie everything off and the box is empty... or full of crap, your choice.Smart move to get this on Netflix, because if this was in theaters, people would demolish it in reviews a bit more, but this way ""it's okay, we give it 6 or 7 out of ten, so brave, so novel, etc"". Now don't get me wrong here, I think this movie is pretty average and okay, but nothing more, hence 5/10. But the cynical side of it makes it somewhat sad. Instead great and proper third movie, we get this predictable and painfully average online movie. This is what you get when you hastily try to tie up anthology series and bank on it as well.

Conversely, if this had been played for camp, it could have been great, but such was not to be.The movie had plenty of problems, but first and foremost, there was the faux suspense. If you recall, in spite of the name, it was actually a twist that 10 Cloverfield Lane was related to Cloverfield - which was brilliant. In this case, we knew the movie was set up to explain the first two movies. We know the monsters are coming, and in fact they explain in first few minutes exactly where they'll be coming from, so why make us wait?I strongly suspect that the script originally had nothing to do with Cloverfield, but they realized how terrible it was and threw in (literally) a minute or two to connect it to that franchise, in the hopes of tricking people into watching it*. It worked on me. You could take those minutes out and it wouldn't change anything.There really wasn't a plot, per se. Imagine a bunch of people got together and brainstormed ideas for a sci fi move, and someone turned that notes into a script. There's a little bit of everything in there: a space station, a particle accelerator, parallel universes, explosive decompression, a tearjerking backstory, betrayal, a bunch of worms (??), so...eh...slime for some reason, and something else really crazy that might be considered a spoiler (again, think Army of Darkness).

The opening scenes are exceptionally dull, and since this is a Netflix film have more than likely led to several people turning off and going to watch something else. However, once it does get going it is an okay sci-fi horror.The opening scenes are only really there to establish a single character, whose main purpose is to tie this film into the Cloverfield universe. There are several laboured tie-ins, which is detrimental to the film. Since there are scenes scattered throughout that cut away from the space station, where the film is trying to establish a growing sense of suspense. The end, when we're supposed to feel relief about the characters that survived making it back to Earth, is ruined by having them suddenly killed by a monster. There is a scene in which a conspiracy theorist is interviewed during a breaking news segment, purely so he can rant incoherently while the audience knows he's right. This could have been a good film if it had realised that naming the ship Cloverfield and calling the film The Cloverfield Paradox would be enough to inform people it takes place in the Cloverfield universe.Aside from this, there are a couple of other problems. The Chinese engineer inexplicably only speaks Chinese throughout, despite every other crew member speaking English regardless of country of origin, and the fact that she can clearly understand English. There's no attempt to establish any kind of logic behind what happens, other than a vague reference to particles and dimensions. How does that explain a sentient severed arm that seems to know more about what happened than the crew, or how various objects from all over the ship ended up inside a single crew member?! If you look past the problems, this film is well-shot, looks good and has some interesting moments. However, it has a lot of poorly thought-out moments and too many laboured tie-ins to other films.

Let's get the job done. The captain goes in he needs to cut that thing down. He can do it alone. Then we have a hard to say goodbye scene, talking talking, looking at eachother through a window. The job and time doesn't matter at all again. Let's waste time one more time.
Then the captain cuts that thing off and everyone survives!
The other 2 didn't do anything beside literally holding up that totally retarded captain.That's a great script :DPoor acting, poor directing everything is poor..

160,aquascape,A downwards trend in the Cloverfield franchise,6,27 March 2018,"When ""Cloverfield"" came out, I thought it was pure found-footage entertainment that made you run with the characters every minute of the horrifying disaster sprung by the monster. I wished for a sequel to it for many years and that more or less came to fruition with ""10 Cloverfield Lane"". While it's not a sequel but a film set in the same universe, I was pleasantly surprised by the plot and craftsmanship of Chazelle's prison-like set-up. After that, news came with new additions to the franchise and my first instinct was that maybe things were moving a bit too fast, looking back at the 8 year gap between ""Cloverfield"" and ""10 Cloverfield Lane"". And so it was, a great cast assembled and a interesting promotional trick couldn't help nor fix what was about to come.Boiling it down, piece by piece, it isn't a bad movie, it's just an average one that doesn't serve the franchise justice. Comparing it to ""Life"" which was released a year earlier, ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" did not add anything new to the space confinement genre.The characters were more or less stereotypical and I, personally, did not feel attached to any of them and going more and more in the movie, I started wishing for a darker ending, which by the way was probably the best part of the movie that tied it to the aforementioned original movie.All in all, ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" is your run-of-the-mill Netflix movie.

It didn't give us the monster bash sequel to Cloverfield that people have been waiting 8 years for, but it delivered a great psychological thriller with a surprise ending, along with some great acting as well. This movie is a generic ""paradox/multi dimension/Event Horizon"" type movie. There's nothing new. It only adds to the Cloverfield universe as a tacked-on afterthought. They literally took a movie called The God Particle and duct taped a few scenes throughout to make it connect to Cloverfield. The acting is fine. The effects are fine. It just isn't what anyone wanted. At least give us a continuation of Mary Elizabeth Winstead's story if you absolutely refuse to revisit the actual Cloverfield monster THIS ENTIRE UNIVERSE STARTED WITH! Her story was cool, and sounded like it had an awesome direction to go at the end of 10 Cloverfield Lane. I don't know what the game is here, but they sure aren't listening to any fans when they are making these ""sequels"" If you can even call them that. I am very easily entertained, I rarely watch a movie that I would say was ""bad"". This movie wasn't bad...just so incredibly ""meh"". I was mildly entertained. That's it. It doesn't deserve to stand beside Cloverfield or 10 Cloverfield lane, however. I would say it is a good thing they tossed this to Netflix. It would have bombed big time at the box office. Give us the continuation of the battle with the original Cloverfield monster on earth. Give us MEW's story of joining the resistance against the forces she faced in 10 Cloverfield Lane.

This is just a very poorly written screenplay. The tiny scene at the start where they plant the seed about beasts and monsters coming thru from another dimension is so blatently bad foreshadowing it makes me sick.

Where did Paramount spend their 40 Mil as it was not on actors....where is not a name amongst them....so what sets?......not great sets either, so it must have been on special effects and CGI. 
Some producer has a new island or holiday mansion payed for from this one as the money was not spent on screen.

Pacing is good, this is just a really well made movie.Some people will complain about the ending, it's a little bit predictable, but it fits well connecting it to the Cloverfield franchise.I don't understand all of the criticisms toward this film, I was enthralled and intrigued throughout.

170,iNickR,So That's What Happened,6,5 February 2018,"The Cloverfield Paradox, in short, is the story of a group of international astronauts hanging out on a space station and doing what scientists normally do in space. All's well until they start messing with things they shouldn't be messing with. There's this big fancy particle accelerator up there that can apparently solve the world's man-made energy crisis and avert an imminent war. The brainiacs have been trying to perfect this thing for two years, and they are so close. There are skeptics back on Earth, though, and many ominously warn of screwing with the God particle. As one pundit puts it, ""This experiment could unleash chaos the likes of which we have never seen.""Understatement of the decade there. The astronauts don't heed the warnings and continue working. The experiment causes a paradox (a contradiction that's true); exactly what was predicted by the cynics. It's not possible, but it's happening. Weird things start developing on the ship, like, ""how the hell does this strange person know who I am?"" And, ""What happened to Earth?"" And ""How did that get there?"" And, most importantly, ""WTF?"" Yep, it's trippy.The newest Cloverfield film explains what caused all the mayhem on Earth ten years ago. If you haven't seen Cloverfield (2008) and/or 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016), see them before you watch this one. Not that you really need to, but you'll enjoy this movie more if you do, and all three together show unique perspectives.The action is intense. The CGI is awesome. The sound-mix worthy of an award. The comic relief is gold (best line in the movie, ""That's my fuckin' arm!).On the other hand, the foreign accents are stereotypical and reminiscent of cheesy b-movies. Awful, just, ugh...stop. Also, it's a little nerdy at times and completely unnecessary for the average viewer. It goes way over my head - I had to research what a particle accelerator actually does only to learn that it wasn't really necessary because it raised more questions than it answered.If you weren't watching Super Bowl 52, or on social media that day, you never would have known about this movie until after its premiere. Keeping with the secretive nature of the Cloverfield franchise, the release of The Cloverfield Paradox (originally titled The God Particle during early development) was only confirmed a mere two hours before, thanks to a slick trailer seen during the game.

It´s not a terrible film either.I think that this is a bit like a christmas special of Doctor Who, epic in places but mostly drawn out and not structured very well with some wooden acting and flaky lines.I like space stations though and the set´s are really good but the plot is not a good one and it is a dull race to the finish with this movie.Not as bad as people are saying but not that good either however I must also deduct points for wasting such an interesting and immersive plot already laid down before it by two previous films and failing to capitalise on some easy wins.Verdict, space is almost always good in films but this is a wasted opportunity to make something good.",The Cloverfield Paradox
172,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,The Unnecessary Paradox of Cloverfield,5,6 February 2018,"Paramount and Netflix have pulled something incredible with their marketing. By suddenly announcing the premiere of the third Cloverfield movie on the streaming service right after the Super Bowl, it got me and the world surprised and excited to see this long-delayed sequel. And it became very clear after staying up late to watch it this was an act of desperation to get attention to a movie that isn't good enough to have a lasting theatrical release.The movie has a compelling sci-fi premise of these scientist and astronauts testing a particle accelerator in space to create an unlimited energy source so a third world war can be prevented. After various tests, an accident happens that sets them in another reality. The film occasionally deals with compelling questions like what we would sacrifice to save humanity and if we could prevent ourselves from repeating the same mistakes but all of that is pushed aside for sake of saying in your face this is a Cloverfield prequel/sequel(?).I am in the group who actually enjoyed the twist at the end of 10 Cloverfield Lane. That movie felt very self-contained with this great story that only subtly connected to the original Cloverfield. None of the Cloverfield elements in this movie felt like they truly belonged because they were very obvious reshoots. A lot of these forced-in elements take place in this large pointless side story on Earth with the main character's husband and a lost child that doesn't really have any real impact to the main space-set story. Unlike the last two movies that had these intense build-ups to a major reveal or event, this movie feels so uneven because it tries to commit to two stories that don't and shouldn't work together.The movie has a great and diverse cast but for the most of it the characters they are given do little to stand out. Gugu Mbatha-Raw does give the best performance and her character Hamilton is the most fleshed out. The film, for the most of it, allows her to have scenes of emotional vulnerability and conflict. Chris O'Dowd does have some fun as the comic relief Mundy but his character doesn't get anything more to do then have a weird moment with his hand. Elizabeth Debicki's mysterious character Jenson does have a compelling emotional scene with Mbatha-Raw but her role in the end becomes very predictable.The movie does have moments of unexpected visual craziness that go along the lines of body horror similar to Alien and Evil Dead 2. They are very tense and disturbing despite being a pg-13 rating. Unfortunately while the elements of realities changing kind of justifies why strange events happen, they do very little to actually move the story along. After a while they just feel like the scenes are just put in there to add moments of shock without any sense of impending danger.I feel as though there was a better, more original story about interdimensional travel in this movie before it was changed from its previous title God Particle (much better then Cloverfield Paradox). And if you thought that wasn't enough, the final shot of the movie I found just to be irritating and heavy-handed.",The Cloverfield Paradox
173,yourfavoritecritic,Not bad. Not good. Meh,5,30 August 2018,"Directed by Julius Onah, The Cloverfield Paradox, is the third entry into the cloverfield universe and tells the story of a group of scientists orbiting earth, trying to solve an energy crisis. While running a test, the crew launches themselves into another dimension, that seems oh so familiar. The announcement of The Cloverfield Paradox, basically came out of nowhere with the film being available to stream hours after the initial trailer dropped. Cloverfield has been known to have peculiar marketing strategies, but with such an abrupt announcement for a third instalment in this sci-fi series, it left audiences stumped and excited. However upon the release of The Cloverfield Paradox, it became clear why this movie was released out of the blue. It's not that The Cloverfield Paradox is a horrible film, but it's also nothing groundbreaking either, and may cement itself as the worst entry in the series so far. The story itself is pretty straightforward, 'space crew in a ship doing research, something goes wrong, space crew is trapped and must find a way to fix it'. It is a formula we've seen over and over again for decades now, sometimes it works in a films favour by trying something unique, and other times it doesn't. Sadly, The Cloverfield Paradox finds itself doing the latter. The little investment I had at the start of the film, was quickly diminished by the second act, as the story just folded in on itself. The plot tries nothing new and ultimately becomes so cliche and straightforward, that I found myself waiting for the credits to roll with still over an hour to go. Compelled with its bad story, The Cloverfield Paradox has an air of cheapness to it with 95% of the film being shot in one place.  Theres really not much I can say about this film, as it just feels so generic. Despite Cloverfield's clever marketing strategy over the years, sadly only one of the films in the series has lived up to its marketing brilliance. Outside of its poor story and overall cheapness the film exudes, theres really nothing positive I can say about this film. It's neither offensively bad or extraordinarily good, and sometimes thats the worst thing a film can be, The Cloverfield Paradox gets a 5/10.",The Cloverfield Paradox

Wow thanks for that.This film is the biggest load of crap I have ever seen. Should have known better in the first 10 minutes with the fake British accents and superrrrr slow pace. Then we are treated to nearly every single minority on earth in one space ship. I literally lasted 51 minutes and that was only cos I got up and made some dinner but tbh this film was lost after the 'arm' incident (come back to this later).The set was poor, like something out of a 70s cardboard cut out bloody star trek cheapo makeshift stage area. The story is too complex too and acting is ok but the British woman? Omg.Anyway back to the arm incident. I've seen this bloke before and never liked him, but this is Netflix so they've got to have a form of comedic character (to appeal to more people I suppose) but the guy literally is not funny. There's no way on earth this dimwit would get a job up there in space. Literally every single sentence he had it was a sarky response to something ie 'do we have paradox interface retina shield ready for displacement?' 'Oh yeh course we can just let me grow a third arm and do this blah blah blah'. Literally every thing was sarky...then his arm gets sucked in the wall. He has help getting back and he sits down all calm and noticed his arm and he says in the most childish cheesiest way... ""Where's my arm? Ohhhh where's my bloody arm?"" Lmfao you couldn't make this up. Then hahahahahahahahah he talks to the doctor or whatever and doc says ""it was like he was born this way"" then he answers ""do you think there's any chance, it'll, grow back?"" Hahahah grow back?

The movie has some creativity and some nice twists and turns to keep you engaged. Of course it borrows from Alien, but that's what you expect from a movie like this. I liked the main heroine and her story made me feel attached to her character. By the end I hoped she succeeded on her mission and overall I thought she gave a great performance. The supporting cast is also quite good.I thought it would be more on the line of a horror film and at parts it kinda was but by the end it turns into more of a thriller. I'm ok with this subversion though and adds something unique to the overall structure of the story. Of course you can pick apart a movie like this and highlight all its scientific inaccuracies and things that don't make sense. However if you go into this expecting a decent sci-fi movie, then you might like the movie. In comparison to the other movies I'd say I liked it more than the first but not the second. 10 Cloverfield Lane was a movie I thoroughly enjoyed, although I wish it wasn't a Cloverfield movie.

Lets go to the start.
(2008)- A very entertaining movie drops out called CLOVERFRIELD which shows an alien monster destroying New York with a hidden mysterious ending of an object falling from the sky in the most discrete way. 
(2016)- Cloverfield Lane came out which had an amazing story and execution with a few head scratches regarding certain aspects of continuation from the first movie which weren't evident. 
(2018)- The Cloverfield Paradox gets a release on Netflix which had the most uncanny story structure, and development to a degree that when enlightened of the story.. you just ask yourself WHAT? 
The ending of this movie supposedly answers the mystery of the first but WHAT? The continuation is horrid. The time period doesn't make sense, the aliens don't look the same in all three movies... 
The final and only possible solution there is lies with the theory that the Cloverfield franchise is the monster that take over a world set in different dimensions? YES.. exactly my point of complete confusion in a very dissatisfying vibe.
OK say thats the case... why didn't you spend three minutes of the movie just making it a little bit clearer?
I will not even get to the different aspects of this movie that made 0 sense. 
The story was weird and not well thought out at all , the acting was good,

186,jwcstorage,"Mentally disconnect ""Cloverfield Universe"" while watching",6,5 February 2018,"While watching Paradox, I'd suggest forgetting that its a ""Cloverfield"" movie!This isnt a knock on the movie itself, as you can see from my score, however being tied to Cloverfield doesnt help this flick. The movie starts out a bit slow, and then it pitches between a really good and really mediocre film several times throughout its run time. All in all, its mostly a good tense space thrilled with a mix between interesting and dumb plot elements. While watching, there are some hamfisted attempts to add ""Cloverfield"" universe stuff in there, which unlike 10 Cloverfield Lane is a detriment to the movie itself unfortunately. However, if you can try to ignore that ""Cloverfield"" side of things you might enjoy the majority of the movie. There are some parts, especially near the end, that feel VERY formulaic, but their acting is pretty solid, the sets and CGI are very good, and there are quite a few wtf moments which even after the end of the film you will be left scratching your head wondering what the purpose of these were. Unfortunately, there are also a few logic holes within the movie that will take some of us 'overthinkers' out of the moment. There were a few 'humorous' moments which will be hit or miss depending on your humor and knowledge of actors within the film. They are rare enough to not really impact the film itself. Ziyi Zhang from Crouching Tiger Hidden Hidden Dragon fame is in this, and not as a China Doll that keeps being forced into Western films to appeal to the Chinese audience and have almost 0 interaction with the ACTUAL movie, main cast, or story at all. She is an actual and important part of the cast and story which is a relief after movies like King Kong and others. IF you watch this for its ""Cloverfield""ness, you will absolutely feel where the reshoots and additional elements were added. The only positive I can say about it is that it will absolutely give the Cloverfield Universe a lot of directions it can go in in the future. The ending in and of itself is... not really good, and it hurts the movie more than helps it unlike 10 Cloverfield Lane. If you are looking for a grand design tied together by this film you absolutely will NOT find it!As a Sci-Fi flick, which we have been in a drought for some time, this flick is more than passable! It will, however, kind of make you wish to have seen whatever the film was originally supposed to be.Had I seen it in the theater, I may have been disappointed if I paid full price, if I had a moviepass I may have been ok with it, but at home on Netflix its worth a watch if you like Sci-Fi and feel a bit tired of superhero flicks forever.",The Cloverfield Paradox

Gugu Mbatha-Raw (Belle) plays Hamilton, David Oyelowo (Selma) is Kiel and Daniel Bruhl (Rush) is Schmidt.This film has decent special effects, especially for a Netflix original and a unexpectedly good score, which is composed by Bear McCreary (The Walking Dead). However, that is about as good as this film gets.First of all, the acting is bland and you can tell that they are not really trying, except for Gugu Mbatha-Raw. Who tries to save this film from its appalling writing and directing. Julius Onah uses Dutch angle after Dutch angle cut together with some shaky cam and you get a film without any style. But the worst thing about this film is definitely the writing. If you combine every cliché ever put on screen you get the script for this film. It is so predictable that about 30mins into it I paused it and predicted everything that would happen by the end, and I got must of it right. You could say that it doesn't deserve as bad a mark as 2/10. But the Cloverfield franchise has been steller and very original up until this installment, So I believe it should get the mark I have given it.2/10",The Cloverfield Paradox
188,arriva,Someone has forgotten about a script,2,5 February 2018,"Let's be blunt: the film made no sense at all.Kudos to actors, to the special effects team and everyone else involved aside from the writer and director - they should never be allowed to write and direct again.This movie physics and logic are only rivaled by Ridley Scott's Prometheus and Alient: Covenant. If you liked those movies, you might like this one, otherwise avoid at all costs.",The Cloverfield Paradox
189,mkquinn91,No Wonder this Wasn't in Theaters,4,2 September 2018,"It's very obvious why this wasn't released in theaters, and was instead pawned off on Netflix. This is a boring mess of a sci-fi movie, with a Cloverfield connection obnoxiously shoehorned in. It consists mostly of scientists running around dark hallways on a space station, encountering cliched sci-fi scenarios, periodically cutting back to a very dull ""who cares?"" story of the lead's husband back on Earth. And giant monsters as an afterthought.",The Cloverfield Paradox
190,Shaun_of_the_Dude,The only paradox is how this was made.,4,7 February 2018,"The Cloverfield Paradox is the third installment of the loosely linked series of genre-bending films from the very lap of Jimmy Jones (I assume) Abrams.The first two films were quite good - they each used their own plot devices and crafted their drama from the situations that the protagonists found themselves in after the world goes to pot. By going to pot, I of course mean situations that you would find yourself in after partaking in a Abrams pot party. But this film feels like a Sy-Fy special, with just a little more cash and resources. In fact, how Netflix paid over £25 million for this is the basis of a good script for a Sy-Fy film. The characters are decent and feel well-formed, as does some of the CGI - but therein lies the problem; regardless of whatever director these films enlist, they will always be Jamie Jones Abrams pet projects. And low and behold, the man has an over-emphasis on telling his stories visually. It is a total wonder how the production team formulate their ideas for the said films. ABRAMS: Okay, we're making a film based on an idea I had whilst watching another film. PRODUCTION CREW: Pray tell. ABRAMS: Well, a group of astronauts are floating about in space trying to sort out Earth's problems. They're all from various parts of the globe, and errr.... (A PRODUCTION CREW MEMBER RAISES AN ARM)PRODUCTION CREW MEMBER: OOOooohhh, oohhh sir, sir... ABRAMS: Excellent idea squire. ABRAMS cuts off his arm in one swipe and the man bleeds to death on the floor. ABRAMS: Great meeting team - back to work!Is how I imagine it went... The dialogue is a mark above that of a b-movie classic, the story is pretentious, the effects are good, but serve little purpose other than to shock, and the resolution made me feel like a pig had just pinched a loaf in my brain. With so much inequality in Hollywood at the moment, and the studio system, figuratively c******g themselves to keep ahead of Netflix, Hulu and Amazon - you would think that Wetflix would have a vested interest in producing genuinely interesting stories with reasonably good plots and dialogue; but no... they are trying to imitate and better an already tired system that churns out populist pap that feels more like 1950s science fiction than progressive, forward-thinking filmmaking. This film is a solid 4 out of 10, and I knocked off 1 point because of the horrid attempt to cash-in on the newfangled spanner that I call 'Pop-Fi'. Science Fiction is a dying art and as long as we have people like John-Joe Abrams creating tosh like this - the genre will become mind-numbingly banal with factory farmed stories, rehashed from other influences. Steer clear - save your screentime for up and coming independent films that will challenge your perspective of the world. (Without throwing in a monster for good measure.)",The Cloverfield Paradox
191,leaugebrett,Tonally Inconsistent and Shoddily Crafted,2,13 February 2018,"Clearly a result of last minute production decisions to shove The Cloverfield name onto a failing script, TCP is a boring, messy, and tonally vacant film. The acting is the best part, but with the tiny set and nonexistant character motivations (outside of Mbatha-Raw's role), much of the cast has little time to make an impact. The rest of the plot is, to put it lightly, dumb, trying to incorporate a mire of underexplained sci-fi mcguffins. Not worth the runtime.",The Cloverfield Paradox
192,knifemagnet,Direct to rent...,2,5 February 2018,"Worthless film. This is why this skipped theatrical release. It's almost as if someone just wanted to make a social statement coupled with an inability to write a competent script and came up with a ninety minute, exhaustive film about a space station, crewed by nearly every race on earth, moving to a new dimension. Lots of goofy plot holes that make no sense; risk the planet and reality because people are too lazy to harness the sun for energy, space station moves to new dimension in a different location and yet picks up new characters, Chinese token racial character is the only one speaking Chinese but everyone can understand her. This film actually fits in well with the other garbage hitting the screen since 2017. Oh, and Ava DyVernay, where's the history being made here? Perhaps it is the fact that a sham of a film exploiting the Cloverfield name is so bad, after spending nearly $40 million Paramount realized the trash they had on their hands, and simply washed their hands of it.

How is it that every interesting sci-fi premise turns out mishandled into a fantasy incoherent aberration?
This movie should be the third installment in a trilogy of movies about something that is not too clear, possibly a monster invasion or a half-life spin-off. One may deduce how a major development in this movies' plot may give rise to the resurgence of such monstrosities, but still, the connection is loosely hinted at and we're not really given any true stable ground to stay on. Matter of interpretations? Interpretation! Irregardless, since the movie itself flies over such matters, lets consider the plot development. Something happens, something merges, strange things start happening. Quantum entanglement is the deus ex machina of the situation and the explanation for everything that happens. Self propelling arm: check. Self propelling writing arm who somehow writes something useful for the plot: check. Magic goo who magically turns alive: check. Things inside other things: check. There's so many things in this movie that don't make any sense. Dunno! Without considering what happens on the earth side plot. Who cares. It's quite bad too.

195,ario-34119,Glad I ignored the bad reviews...,7,10 March 2018,"Because it's a good movie.Let me start with this: I didn't watch Cloverfield because I couldn't stand first person camera view movies. People say it's good, I'm a sci-fi lover, but I just can't. So I can only read what it's about, but don't know the details. I did watch Ten Cloverfield Lane, though, and I love it.If I may venture a guess, I think this is some kind of prequel. This is what happens to cause the things that happen in Cloverfield and Ten Cloverfield Lane. And I'm telling you, ignore the bad reviews, because it's good. Good story with good direction and great cast with great acting. The suspense is good, the gore is not over the top, and the script provides emotional moments that the cast deliver very efficiently.If there are any flaws, it's probably just the pace, which is a bit slow and predictable twists. There are also some plot holes that doesn't really bug me. I would've given it a 9 if it weren't for them.",The Cloverfield Paradox
196,parrot007,Unnecessary. Unintelligent. LAZY.,4,6 June 2021,"So...you title your movie ""The Cloverfield Paradox"", yet you never go into any detail on what that is. It's a situation where you smash togather multiple demensions and/or timelines. Nobody seems to know anything beyond that or what constitutes the word paradox. The TRUTH is that the writers don't know either. They made it up as an excuse to bend reality and do weird things which isn't bad on its own, but the problem is that they set no boundaries whatsoever. No wonder JJ Abrams produced this garbage. Time travel, multiple realities, wormholes(?), impossible physics, teleportation, a functioning arm separated from someone's body, a guy having 5000 worms and a magic metal sphere in his chest, and many other dumb as **** things are all possible apparently just because multiple demisions! Waazammm!! The ending might get you the first time, but upon rewatch is totally baseless and with hardly any explication or development previously. What you have is a movie that acts smart and scientific and takes itself very seriously, but is acctualy incredibly unintelligent and LAZY.Also, why the F is anyone praising this movie for it's cast/performances?!? That is complete nonsense. The characters are all either two dementional or one demensional. Most of the delivery is flat and the overall weak writing doesn't help. These people can't even cry; the tears are obviously fake and most of what little emotion there is comes from the gruesome injuries sustained by the crew. Also note that a large portion of the movie is just the crew bickering, sometimes for a good reason, sometimes not. Not all of it's acting is bad, but it's not even close to great. Some scenes are fairly good, most are mediocre, and some really suck. Do not listen to anyone who says this acting is noteworthy in any capacity. They are either dumb or a liar.Let me explain the difference between a crappy imitation of the Sci Fi genre (backed by JJ Abrams of course🙄) and a good Sci Fi writer like Christopher Nolan. For the most part, Nolan is able to ground his ideas IN THEIR OWN WORLD. The Cloverfield Paradox does not make any sense. However, Tenet for example, doesn't make any sense either right? Wrong. Because Tenet does not BREAK ITS OWN RULES at least to the point where the average person can suspend their disbelief. Therefore, as a Sci Fi movie, it has a right to break rules without being considered nonsensical while still maintaining a serious tone. With Cloverfield Paradox, the rules are intentionally vague because the writers are lazy, period. You'd be deluded to think otherwise. It never sets defined boundaries and just goes off of the assumption that ANYTHING is possible when demensions collide, which I say again, is immensely LAZY and completely undermines it's serious tone.A Sci Fi movie does not have to be 100% scientifically sound. However, it firstly should be either an expansion of plausible ideas/theories, or a fictional idea that is at least well developed. The Cloverfield Paradox is a fictional idea whos only context is what some unnamed guy on a TV who wrote a book by the same name says. It's acctually pretty insulting that he says 'read my book if you want to understand', yeah man that would be great if we could do that!! The second rule is that a Sci Fi movie must obey its own rules as it moves forward. Cloverfield Paradox fails on this front too because even when you just go along with the vague absurdity of it's premise, it STILL has major plot holes and stupidly impossible things. It just does whatever is most convient for that plot and throws in shocking things to keep people engaged artificially. Why does the guys body burst and explode worms everywhere? Who was he talking to in the mirror? How the F can you 3D print a gun?? How did that alternative deminsion woman know where the gun was??? Why didn't she just shoot everyone including the main character when she has the chance instead of giving speeches?? Why was there a camera on the escape pod and did she seriously just wake up at precicly the right time to catch her walking menacingly toward her crewmates? Who is the husband talking to on the phone at the end and why does that person have no clue what's going on on earth? There's forgivable plotholes and there there's this nonsense. And it once again exposes bad and LAZY writing.To clarify again: A Sci Fi movie like this usually can start off simply with a question of ""what if"". What if we used a partical accelerator to smash demensions togather? When your answer is ""Multiple people in different timelines will intersect"" okay, nice that creates a lot of storytelling potential. When your answer is ""A guys arm will glitch through a wall and start crawling around on its own"" uhhhh, okay, whatever. When your answer is ""A monster the size of a city will appear on earth"" you are officially just writing out of your *** and I don't give a **** if it's the Cloverfield monster from a 10 year old movie because you were supposed to give real context to it here but instead you just LAZILY use it as an end twist, only raising more questions about what this connected universe is...WTF?!?!

The second half takes a turn for the worse in terms of focus, too many new threads that needs to be resolved too quickly, so much so that the viewer most likely will lose track and fade away. But still, the movie holds up for the most part.If you liked Cloverfield you'll probably wont like this movie but on the other
hand if you did like Cloverfield Lane than this is more in line of your taste.The only minor rants I have for this movie is that it's a risk casting comedians in a serious movie and this is a good example, you'll see what I mean.

Well no, but Chris O'Dowd was funny even when I would have lost my mind. Weird but worth several chuckles... that guy is always great. He wasn't taking things too seriously... I wish I had his attitude! Overall, it wasn't the worst thing ever. I liked a few of the actors, I liked bits of the ending, the beginning couple scene plus the lost girl at the end had an interesting human element, and the special effects were more than decent. The explanation that ties all the movies together, while I guess lazy if you listen to the X-Files, is fine. But as a whole, it just wasn't something very enjoyable. Was it the plot? Was it the body horror not my favorite thing, despite the fact that I'll enjoy the classics? I am not sure, but it just didn't come across as a great movie.

To avoid spoilers I won't go into any details but I wasn't too happy with the scene where the water freezes as quickly as it does. Still, to a large extent, it didn't do the standard replication of other movies which is bonus points IMHO.If you have watched as many sci-fi movies as I have you will be pleasantly surprised that you cannot predict what will happen yet the writers avoid cliché - even the ending isn't standard.This movie, IMHO, is not a 10 but if you love sci-fi movies you really should watch it.",The Cloverfield Paradox
203,travishouze,"Even More a ""Paradox"" Trying to Make Sense of It All",6,5 February 2018,"The films with the smallest amount of details on the surface can be the most fun to speculate, which is exactly why I fell in fascination with the 2008 film Cloverfield. It's unconventional approach to a monster movie told from the average persons point of view, and even inspired one of my own films that same year. The franchise has always maintained a great level of marketing and The Cloverfield Paradox maintains by surprise announcing the release hours before its release.The film takes place in a space station as scientists try to harvest a powerful amount of energy due to Earth's diminishings resources. While succeeding after months of failed tests, they tore open a paradox that effects those on the station and even more that I refuse to spoil.As a fan of the franchise, I've always liked the idea the films never really feel similar to one another and show many different perspectives on the same series of events. The film maintains a strong sense of unpredictability as when the paradox kicks in, there's no real sense of where it will take you. Sometimes that paradox aspect works and other times it doesn't as I found myself confused on the rules of how characters are affected. This view nonetheless doesn't make the Cloverfield connection as jammed in like 10 Cloverfield Lane, however, it could have benefited from stronger characters.The film mostly focuses on Hamilton (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), as she plays a young wife far away from her husband on the mission. While she is given a bit to work with in the first and third acts, the other characters feel slightly flat and lacking emotion for a crew that's around each other for a very long time. Chris O'Dowd is subjected to be a comic relief and not always doesn't his jokes land either.While The Cloverfield Paradox answers some questions, it makes you ask a ton more. It's fascinating, yet strangely too overwhelming and derivative at the same time. I can understand this film feeling a bit harder to market than the last couple movies, but I think it does what Cloverfield is best known for, making you speculate every single thing on screen.Rating: 6 / 10",The Cloverfield Paradox

That's when they sort of explain the origin of the Cloverfield monsters and everything interesting happens. The rest you have probably already seen in other movies. It is far too obvious that this not originally a Cloverfield movie, as the Cloverfield elements seem very out of place. But sure, it gives an explanation to the first two movies, which might be nice. I'm not sure actually. I think I liked it better when I didn't understand where the monsters came from. As mentioned, it's not really a bad movie, but it's not great either. Fine cast, well directed, nice effects, and there is a basic story, just not a very interesting one. And of course, when cramming in some Cloverfield story lines I am no longer sure which story it wants to tell; the Cloverfield one, or the hazards of colliding dimensions, or the difficult choices the protagonists have to make. They should have made this as the God Particle, left out the Cloverfield elements, and they would have ended up with a semi-decent space thriller.",The Cloverfield Paradox

207,julesfdelorme,Better than expected,7,8 February 2018,"The Cloverfield ParadoxThe Cloverfield Paradox got a lot of hype with it's ad during the Super Bowl. I didn't see the ad. I don't watch football. Nothing against football. I just realized a long time ago that I had to keep my sports addiction down to two sports. Anyone who has ever seen me watch a fight or a hockey game can tell you why that would be. I get way too involved and way too carried away for my own good.
That's rarely been my problem with horror movies. I usually find them too stupid and too lazy to keep my attention. It definitely was not a problem with the first Cloverfield movie. I thought that was a hackneyed rip off of The Blair Witch Project, with a little bit of Godzilla thrown in. Not even the original Godzilla, which was far better than its low budget and comical dubbing should have allowed it to be. More like all those terrible remakes.
And I suspect that the sequels have recognized the weaknesses of the original in the way that they sought to reframe the story into a less ridiculous concept. You had John Goodman trapping people in a bunker and the question of whether he was insane, the world really had come to an end via alien invasion, or both. That didn't quite work because the Cloverfield title gave at least part of the ending away.
And now you have the J.J. Abrams produced version in which (Spoiler Alert. Sort of...) a Particle Accelerator experiment in space goes awry, opens a rift into another dimension and the crew has to deal with the consequences. 
So we've gone from one of those Blair Witch/ Alien Invasion movie to one of those Alien/ Space Ship gets trapped in a Paradox movies.
But the real surprise, at least for me, is that it's pretty good.
Not great.
But a lot better than the first movie and less clumsy than the second.
There were only two before this, right? Please tell me that there were only two before this.
The point is that this version is almost slick enough and smart enough to overcome its ancestry.
If you're a fan of the first two, no offense, this one might be a little too sophisticated and might not have nearly shaky camera action going on for you. Okay, that's probably not fair. I know some smart people who loved the original. I don't get it. But I don't actually think that you have to be stupid or have terrible taste to have liked the first two movies.
But this one is more cerebral, and less schlocky than the first two, so it might not be everyone's cup of tea.
Yes, in the end it still struggles to explain how we end up with Godzilla like monsters and aliens, and it struggles at times to make sense out of the Paradox that it's named after. It doesn't always succeed. But the acting is solid, Chris O'Dowd earns some very legitimate laughs in his scenes, (Something the others definitely lacked. A few good laughs to put us in the mood to be willing to forgive their flaws) the writing is pretty good and that mostly made me willing to overlook what didn't quite make sense.
Mostly.
Considering that I made an argument for The Vault despite its very obvious flaws, I feel much more comfortable recommending this one. Not quite ready to forgive quite as much, because the budget here is far greater and the hype much greater. 
But in the end this is a movie that more people are likely to enjoy.
Hey, even I enjoyed it. And I hated the first movie and was just bored by the second.
Yes, The Cloverfield Paradox is flawed.
How could it not be with those kinds of parents?

Yes we are not told why Earth is not trying other options but thats the plot of the film(!) Just imagine they're tried everything and only option is big shiney beam as unlimited power which for safety reason needs to be tested in space first.
Yes the warning from book writer was a bit more specific but it is not a huge mistake I mean lots of people have lots of wild theories and know for sure what happen.
Missing Earth well yeah it was explained that they are using 'expensive compass' to set the position because through windows they didn't see anything - understandable.... Some how ...but hey better to get this situation then watching crew for 20mins looking for Sun.
Mina the girl in the wall and Ava the main character didn't recognize Tam the Asian girl because she was doing her job in their reality(!) They explained it in the movie if you didn't get it go and watch it again - even more that is why Ava says it is still ok even with Tam has gone because they have Mina(!)
Worms in Volkovs body, girl in wall and wall taking hand was also explained by two dimensions colliding - yes, hard to believe, yes another 'bad event' ...sci-fi cliche.
Yes I agree, hand writing to look in Volkovs stomach was weird and even for sci-fi bad, water overflow and locked door... They should get rid of this cliche but I it was ok. What was really stupid was detaching the maintenance ring - ok they have to get rid of captain... But to detached it you need to be inside?

And this is the fundamental flaw of 'The Cloverfield Paradox', it never feels like its own story, merely just a retcon intended to open up the franchise to more installments with the brand name attached.I think everyone can admit that the cast for this film is absolutely stunning. You have several hot property Oscar-caliber stars with some sought-after character actors to back them up... and Chris O'Dowd. What exactly attracted names like Gugu Mbatha-Raw, David Oyelowo and Daniel Brühl to this project (other than money) is so far beyond my comprehension that we could in fact be living in our own Cloverfield parallel universe. Their characters are either walking plot ciphers or basic horror movie fodder with no discernible differences between them other than their nationalities and simplistic emotional pallets (i.e. anger or fear). The script from 'Paranormal Activity' creator Oren Uziel could easily be a 20 year old first time screenwriter's attempt at knocking out a sci-fi thriller and has the dialogue to match. To be fair to Uziel, he does have the daunting task of trying to both expand upon and tie together all these different films, but winds up throwing in everything but the kitchen sink. There are too many ideas flying around that do not hold together cohesively enough to work, or even make sense, when all we needed was just a simple story with a clear and defined trajectory - the one trait the previous films shared in common the most.Furthermore, the production looks disappointingly cheap. Compare the stagey production design to that of Danny Boyle's tremendous 'Sunshine' and this suddenly begins to look like a Syfy Channel original. I can totally understand how this bypassed cinemas and went straight to Netflix because had I been the distributor (in this case Paramount), I'd have taken one look at the final cut and cringed with embarrassment (and possibly died from shame). Perhaps director Julius Onah is going for that sci-fi B-feature feeling, in which case the film is a complete success because it most certainly is B-grade. It's just a shame it takes down an A-list cast with it. That's not to say that the film is not enjoyable on these terms because it most certainly is - if you like monster movies and 'Alien' rip-offs - but you have to buy into the core concept of what JJ Abrams and co are trying to do, which is to cynically reverse engineer a mythology based on a 10 year old found footage monster flick so they can launch the 'Cloverfield' multi-verse. The thing is, 'Cloverfield' was nothing more than a viral marketing campaign in search of a better movie, while '10 Cloverfield Lane' was a really good thriller that would have been better served as a standalone story. So 'The Cloverfield Paradox' was somewhat doomed to fail in many ways. That said, there is enough fun to be had with the increasingly bonkers plot and spotting all the ham-fisted attempts at mythology building to almost make it a guilty pleasure. Almost.",The Cloverfield Paradox

The plot made sense, characters generally behaved believably, the acting wasn't bad, and the ending, whilst a bit absurd is exactly what I thought would happen considering it's a Cloverfield movie. I wonder if the people giving this movie 1 or 2 stars should even be watching this kind of film; they must hate the genre.I would say that it's probably the worst of the three Cloverfield movies, but it's not a bad movie.The only thing I found that made no sense at all was why one character spoke in Chinese, and everyone understood her, whilst they spoke English and she understood them. I assume it was done for the Chinese audience, but it makes no sense at all in the logic of the film. As a multilingual person myself who interacts with others who speak multiple languages, you speak in one language.

People who make a movie that is confusing and has no questions explained, but instead of giving us what we want, they just say ""we'll answer all of your questions in the next movie!"" We earlier got teased with Jeepers Creepers 3, which opened about a million doors of questions but instead of answering them and giving audiences what they want, they just said ""tune in for JC4!"" It's stupid! This film isn't entirely bad, but it's so annoying to be invested in a film for 90+ minutes, waiting to see what everything is leading up to, only for it to end with a ""stay tuned for the sequel to find out"" ending. JJ Abrams thinks he's being all clever with these ""secrets"" but it's just irritating. Cloverfield is cool and all but it's not even that interesting of a franchise to keep people sucked in. Sooner or later, people are going to get seriously annoyed by the same crap over and over AND OVER again and will stop caring. In all seriousness, the film is not TERRIBLE, but it is super bland and dull and makes zero sense. Who's arm did that belong to? Why did that guy get attacked by the glue putty? Why did that Russian guy have the earthworms and the geosphere thingy inside of him? How did that woman get fused with the spaceship? None of those questions are answered, they just happen. I thought MAYBE the universe the characters were in was attacking them Final Destination-style because they didn't belong there, but the movie never explains it and it just makes no sense. Also, the ending has the return of the classic Cloverfield monster, but for some reason the monster is like 10 miles tall. Did they not even see their own movie?

Everything on the ship yes but the random ass story line with her husband saving a kid and going to a bunker, that felt like it was trying to mimic 10 Cloverfield lane? Idk if that was the point but tbh I didn't see a point in showing us his time on earth since we didn't see much maybe a shot of the monster and a few over things but idk that was just pointless!I really liked most of the stuff that happened on the ship like going into a different dimension and things getting moved around so jenson getting stuck in the wall since they crossed over and the warms getting moved inside him! There was definitely some strong actors in this film but there is definitely some weakness in there aswell! I loved cloverfield and 10 cloverfield lane, and this was meant to be the movie that bridged that gap but I can see why it left a few people like ahh what the hell?
I think that the earth they went back to is definitely not the same earth that the other 2 movies where on maybe there is 100s of didnt ones but definitely wasn't the same!

The tenseness and intrigue die down, and most of the characters start doing increasingly dumb things, especially the ""British"" woman. She, while being given the most screen time, is the most annoying character of all with uneven acting and unconvincing family drama. Also, you can tell that the scenes on Earth were added later in production mainly to tie the movie to the ""Cloververse"", as they're largely redundant and don't add much to the plot.So, while it could have been better, the Cloverfield Paradox is still quite good and it's a neat surprise that it has come out out on the same day as the trailer.",The Cloverfield Paradox

The movie has enough action to engage the audience for its run time.Bad: There is nothing new here compared to Alien (1979) or Life (2017).

232,Watcher42,Begin the Cloverfield milking!,2,5 February 2018,"If there's one word I would associate with the original Cloverfield and its sequel, it is 'intrigue'. The first film was a fresh take on the Godzilla movie. But I wanted to know more about where this creature actually came from, and explore the hints at a shadowy government / corporate back story. It piqued my interest and intrigued me.Then 10 Cloverfield Lane came along. It was so different, but still welcome. It didn't add a massive amount of new info (unless you looked hard), but it was well made, well acted, pushed the overall Cloverfield arc forward a bit, and again - it was intriguing.Now we have Paradox. A by-the-numbers dumb sci-fi, full of stupid characters doing stupid things. The entire film could have been summed up in 2 minutes of exposition or intro while the credits ran at the start of a more intelligent, well written film. I've seen it reported in a few places that if Netflix hadn't picked this up it would have received a cinema release. No way. This is straight to DVD stuff with above average acting (for the most part). I hope it doesn't signal the start of the Cloverfield IP getting milked, as it is still full of potential (assuming they can find a good writer and director). I'm surprised JJ allowed this one through, I guess his eye was on Star Wars.And special mention to Chris O'Dowd. I can only assume his character brief simply stated 'Just be Roy from the IT Crowd'. I kept waiting for Moss to appear and say 'I think you'll find this isn't actually the Cloverfield Paradox, this is actually a discarded episode of Star Trek TNG from 1988'.If you want something in this vein with more horror, check out Event Horizon.

Unfortunately, the intrigue leads absolutely nowhere.First, I'll talk about the things that I did enjoy. The performances were fairly good. Nobody really stood out to me, except for maybe Gugu Mbatha-Raw. Another thing is that this is a very good looking movie. Lastly, I was fairly intrigued by this movie.However, this movie had some big problems. The first thing that I will bring up is the plot. There were some creepy and interesting things that happened throughout the movie, but they are never explained; even worse, it doesn't even seem like the characters really care for an explanation. For example, the character Mundy gets his arm sucked into a wall. When he manages to pull it out, his hand is gone; it's not like it has been amputated, but more like it was never there in the first place. Later, the hand shows up and is revealed to be sentient, and is even able to write stuff down. As weird and cool as this is, it's never explained how this is possible. The writing is so lazy that it doesn't even bother to explain these things. I think that the big problem was that this movies wasn't supposed to be a ""Cloverfield"" movie in the first place. It was originally a movie called ""God Particle"", which Abrams liked and added to the universe. It was since delayed multiple times until it was bought by Netflix and released on Super Bowl Sunday.Another problem is the connection to the ""Cloverfield"" franchise. As interesting as it is, it also feels pretty lazy. The plot device is that an accident with a particle accelerator opens up a hole in space and time, which causes multiple different universes to weave themselves into others. For example, this is probably how the Cloverfield monster appeared in the first film, and how the aliens appeared in ""10 Cloverfield Lane"". But this basically means that you can have pretty much anything in the franchise now. For all we know, there could even be a movie about Mundy's hand (""The Cloverfield Amputated Limb"" is a really catchy title) or Nazi zombies. Oh wait, the latter is actually being made into the fourth ""Cloverfield"" movie.As a fan of the franchise, this was disappointing. I was expecting a great movie, and instead, I got a sinker.

243,zhdcndmr,Frustatingly stupid conclusion to the Cloverfield story.,3,5 February 2018,"I noticed this movie in Netflix and I thought I might give it a try being one of the people who actually was intrigued with the cloverfield story.
First off, its starts confusing. Its supposed to explain the Cloverfield story but at first it seems like the story is not even playing in the real (our) world. Its an earth that seems like its in the future because there is this Satellite that tries to create Fusion/Unlimited energy.
What makes it utterly stupid is the fact that the only explanation you get for the Cloverfield monster is a news report in the movie hinting that whatever the satellite is doing to create unlimited energy will collide dimensions and he literally says ""Monsters, demons, BEASTS FROM THE SEA"" might come into our reality. 
So if we go back to the setting of the movie with the humongous satellite trying to create fusion energy we fastly realize that this ""explanation"" of a movie fails miserably by implying that the Cloverfield movie was not even playing out in our world. What makes that frustrating is that whatever made the Cloverfield movie watchable was the fact that it happened in ""our world"" this movie throws that notion out the window and it doesnt even stop there. There are so HUGE inconsistencies with the Cloverfield story that this doesnt feel like anything else then something thrown together at the last second to generate some extra cash. It literally doesnt answer ANYTHING still and the little events we get to see that happens down at earth just confuses me even more when I think about how it doesnt fit in with the story from Cloverfield.

Why didn't they diminish from my enjoyment? Well, simply put, I didn't expect much and I received a great deal more than I had any real reason to hope for.

I was notified the other day that a new Cloverfield movie was already out so I checked it out as I wasn't expecting one yet. It turns out that while making the God Particle movie at some point they decided that it was going to be the next Cloverfield movie. Whether they felt the story wasn't going as planned or it was too good to be this low-ish budget movie called God Particle or it wasn't good enough and wanted to add the Cloverfield name to it to boost it or they just couldn't get together a decent plot for the next Cloverfield movie and decided to use this one or some other idea but whatever they thought and maybe we wont find out the truth behind it they decided God Particle is now The Cloverfield Paradox the 3rd so called Cloverfield movie.The original God Particle movie sounded quite good with Russia and America at war which a group of American astronauts are in space find themselves being contacted by some Russians as they discover Earth has in fact disappeared. This was all done with around a $10,000,000 budget until they decided to use part of this story with extra scenes added to make it into the 3rd Cloverfield movie. When completed I read the budget was now around $45,000,000 and they felt it would be hard to get that money back through box office takings so they decided to sell it to Netflix. After reading the bad reviews which were mainly about the script and then watching it and reading the background of the movie I can see why people thought it was a bit of a messI wasn't expecting much from this movie after reading those reviews but was hoping it was going to be better than what most people said. I was happy to say it was OK, in fact better than OK as in the end I rated it 7 out of 10 which is the same as I rated the original Cloverfield and more than the 6 I gave 10 Cloverfield Lane which I felt was over long and so slow paced that I was struggling to give it more than a 5 rating until the last 10 minutes which boosted it to a 6 in the end. I thought The Cloverfield Paradox a decent sci-fi, with a good cast, good acting, likable characters, plenty of action, some nice humour in it especially from Chris O'Dowd, good effects for the budget and not a bad story considering its background and how it came about. Plus it seems to kind of explain a bit more of how the original Cloverfield movie came about.Apparently the next Cloverfield installment is entitled Overlord or at least it is listed as that at the moment and at the time of me writing this it is already completed. Lets hope it is more of the original Cloverfield, without the found footage theme and with a lot more Monster/Alien action. :)",The Cloverfield Paradox

249,Evey88,Just Mad,4,16 July 2018,"Cloverfield was a great movie and deserved other great films that did an intelligent job connecting everything.I saw the bad reviews and thought I would give it a shot any way - but this movie failed in a lot of areas.First off, the plot was all over the place! Great Sci-Fi movies can bridge reality and fiction, so lines are almost eerily blurred. In this movie, the director didn't seem to care how outlandish things were. Oh, let's take a shoe and have it attack the whole station with ketchup addicted slugs. I mean, just random stuff all over the place that didn't make sense. It added ridiculousness to it. Plus, the movie is hard to follow in a sense because it has so much random stuff thrown in there and side plots - you almost forget the whole reason they're up in space.It connected to Cloverfield slightly, but I don't feel it had respect for the first film. I mean Cloverfield was really good! Very well directed! This killed the series unfortunately. A very poor attempt to bridge what could have been an excellent series.If the Cloverfield series is to be saved, this needs to be completely done away with and a new movie done, with a much better plot and a much deeper and more respectful and interesting connection to the first movie.",The Cloverfield Paradox
250,marneederider,We want science in our science fiction,2,1 January 2021,"It is strange that producers don't understand that in science fiction, it has to be plausible based on the known science at the time it was made. It's one thing to have a drama not be realistic with respect to a court scene (though it may annoy those in the legal professions). But in a science fiction movie, we want the creators to have a basic understanding of gravity, the law of inertia, etc. These are things most every viewer understands.Unless it's very good in other ways, a science fiction movie that is unrealistic just makes many people shake their heads and laugh. This was not that great in other ways, not enough to make up for the ridiculously wrong portrayal of what would happen in space.Also, they had cliches such as the captain giving a speech, wasting time and thus jeopardicing not one, but two ENTIRE universes. That was when I paused and wrote this review, with about 15 minutes left in the movie.I liked the actors, all of them, especially the captain, and I hope they go on to do other, better movies.",The Cloverfield Paradox

It is definitely not worth getting a months subscription to Netflix to watch it. I already had a Netflix subscription and in that light I found the movie to be almost reaching the OK mark. There are both some good moments and some really terrible moments in this film. It started out fine, but became more and more silly and subjective to stereotypical cliches and odd gags, and ended up feeling as a bit of a mess. Without ""Cloverfield"" in the name, it would just be yet another obscure direct-to-streaming film that no one bothers about. It is without a doubt a low-point in the franchise that will disappoint a lot of fans and which could be hard for the ""brand"" to recover from. I really loved 10 Cloverfield lane, but I found the last 10 minutes of that film to be very disappointing which vastly lowered my expectations for The Cloverfield Paradox - otherwise I too would probably have been one of the displeased Cloverfield fans giving a one star rating here.",The Cloverfield Paradox

They are wastable and we don't care for them.Too many bad things happen with no connection of cause. They are just disconnected, as if the director or the story writer just wanted more bad things to happen to make everything sadder.All characters are altruistic and hoping to die to save the others and all billion ppl on Earth.And, in the end, some stuff ended with no explanation. Why did only the girl get to the ship while the rest of the crew didn't? Why did the messages of the other dimension replaced their own messages? What happened to the guy with the worms to just keep alive with them and what made him build the gun?

256,WondrousMoose,"A run-of-the-mill horror film, The Cloverfield Paradox isn't particularly scary or interesting and is hardly worth watching.",4,6 February 2018,"Viewers must have been shocked when Netflix made their Super Bowl announcement that the newest Cloverfield film was immediately available for streaming. This sort of flash marketing has had some great success in the past, and as audiences scrambled to their computers, well, I hope they enjoyed what they saw more than I did.Somewhere in the future, the earth is on the brink of losing all major power sources. Humanity's only hope is the Shepard, a particle accelerator launched into space that can theoretically produce infinite energy. When a test run goes horribly wrong, the crew of the ship find themselves in a terrifying place between dimensions.Perhaps the single biggest missed opportunity of The Cloverfield Paradox is the fact that it doesn't maintain tension throughout its run. When horrifying things happen, characters react in the moment and are then okay afterward, only talking a little bit louder and frowning more than before. The score is that of a generic action movie with disparate noises and Inception-style ""BWOM""s thrown in for effect. The film cuts seemingly at random between the events on the space station and Earth, ruining any chance of maintaining a consistent atmosphere in either story. The film doesn't have much to work with, though, as it hardly has scary scenes at all; what it does have, though, is a wacky, dancing eyeball and wild, spinning foosball spooks!This feels like a movie that doesn't want to be too much of one thing, so it refuses to be anything. Much of the film's look and feel are a bit too nice, with the perfectly groomed characters in their spotless uniforms running through shiny, well-lit sets. The few interesting moments that this film has are quickly lost as it has no identity of its own. David Oyelowo is markedly out of place in the film, with his realistic actions contrasting his boring cast members. I feel sorry him and am honestly impressed that he could deliver lines such as, ""This dimension is eating us alive!"" with a straight face.This review isn't as long as most because I don't have much to say.The Cloverfield Paradox is simply every horror movie in space done worse. It takes the trans-dimensional horror of Event Horizon, sprinkles in some Alien and Sunshine for good measure, and glosses over it all with some low-budget flair. This isn't a horror film; this is a line of bland scenes occasionally interrupted by gross things and loud noises. It isn't as spectacularly bad as many horror movies can be - it's just boring. I'd recommend not watching it, but if you do, know that you likely won't remember what you saw a week afterward.",The Cloverfield Paradox

However, like many viewers the attempts to link it to the original Cloverfield felt very tacked on and out of place. I feel it would have been a better movie if they had not tried to link the stories. And the way in which they connected them cheapened both the original and this movie.

Oh what a disappointment. I call it non sci-fi because it's so full of nonsense. An average fantasy move has more logic in it than this movie. Doesn't make sense from start to end. There is no ""science"" in this movie. The end is really ridiculous and emphasizes the complete retardation (or call it non-education or low intelligence) of the script writer(s). Most high school educated children already know that water doesn't instantly freeze in outer space (it will actually boil due to the 0 pressure), also a space station filled with O2 isn't like filled with gas where a spark would give a blast. Besides that it's not needed to fill it with 100% O2 to overcome a few hours. Besides that O2 pumps doesn't use megawatts of power. Come on, script writer(s), use your brain(s).

Here you have a very diverse crew of astronauts (even though their countries are at war fighting each other) trying to find a source of unlimited energy in a method that is very, very poorly explained if not it isn't explained at all they just spit random scientific words but it really never makes sense, you just feel like they are tying to fool you, they also never explain why the earth ran out of energy, they just mention oil a few times but they don't seem to be worried about any other alternative like solar or eolic something absurd considering they live in the year 2029.The movie is full of overused Sci-Fi cliches that we have already seen a million times in Star Trek or Alien and bad decisions that make the crew of scientists sent to save the world look like 10 y/o kids trying to solve a problem.3 stars because it at least solves the mistery about Clovie or Aliens by saying some weird space experiment sent aliens and monsters though earth's timeline but a whole movie wasn't needed, that is just a short sentence you could have said in a more interesting movie following the Cloverfield's pattern.PD. I totally loved when they looked through the windows and acted like ""OMG we dissapeared The Earth, we killed everyone!"" instead of a more reasonable answer like ""Yeah, this thing sent us far away from our planet"" this was more of a ""James Franco and Seth Rogen in Space"" scene rather than a serious sci-fi movie.",The Cloverfield Paradox

267,VVMini,A bunch of random nonsense happening,3,6 February 2018,"I'm a big fan of the first two movies in the Cloverfield 'franchise'. The original Cloverfield is a fantastic old school monster movie, and 10 Cloverfield Lane is a great psychological and claustrophobic thriller. The latter movie was clearly tacked on to the Cloverfield universe, despite having very little to do with the original Cloverfield. That in itself is not a problem, as long as the movie is good, which it definitely is. 10 Cloverfield Lane even suffers from being part of the franchise, as the tacked-on ending was not in line with the rest of the movie.The Cloverfield Paradox tries to go the same route, where the movie is extremely loosely tied to the larger universe. In this case however, the loose ties are not saved by the movie itself, which is a jumbled mess of random and meaningless nonsense happening. Basically, The Cloverfield Paradox is yet another space quest gone wrong story as we have had many in the past, with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately, this movie falls in the very bottom end of the success spectrum, due to its messy story and unfinished story elements. While I appreciate the fact that they tried to create a horror movie without an actual monster or villain, the result of this attempt is that they had to create a few scares and gory moments that do not really make any sense. In fact, none of the things that happen ever get explained in any satisfactory manner, other than 'the two dimensions collided/merged'. Moreover, the whole storyline on earth was only added to pad the runtime and make for the very loose connection to Cloverfield. It did not add anything interesting and only raised more questions that it never even tried to answer.Ultimately, the biggest sin of this movie is that it was boring and uninteresting, the last thing you would expect from a science fiction horror movie tied into a larger monster universe. I kept waiting for cool explanations and reveals, but they never showed up. What you see is pretty much what you get; just a few people getting killed off in gruesome ways, because that is what a horror movie does. At the very least I was hoping for some cool tie ins to the original Cloverfield but even those were shoehorned in or flimsy at best. It certainly didn't answer how the monster was created or ended up there, something it advertised it would. It just resorted to the same old 'two dimensions collided/merged' non-answer all the movie used. I'm pretty sure that chronologically none of it even makes sense, as people in the original Cloverfield seemed totally unaware of the events in this movie. In the end, this movie fails both as a stand alone movie, as well as a part of a larger franchise (due to it barely being part of that franchise). It's clear that the only reason that this is a Netflix film is that everyone involved probably realized that it would flop hard if this got a theater release. And I think that is the biggest positive of this movie: at least I didn't have to pay for it.",The Cloverfield Paradox

The acting is some of the worse i've seen, we already don't have characters but tokens and pawns for lazy screenwriters, but the line reads go from cringy to absolute atrocious.The main lead actress has the same expression for pretty much the whole movie, some weird thing happens and she continues with her mopey face. The rest of the cast continues the same way.But the worst aspect is definitely the pretentious philosophical elements in the film, they come out of nowever and are used in a contrived way to expand the time of the movie.Boring, stupid and just plain silly.

No question it's worth watching and judging its merit for oneself, which is what I myself did. And what I found is a movie, like many of its conempararies, that is watchable as long as one knows very little about space, or common sense, or the value of training when one is qualified to actually be in space, or... the boiling point of H2O in space.If one knows anything at all about these things then the movie becomes nearly unwatchable.The good news is if one chooses to overlook sense, reason, and science itself, then absolutely it's an enjoyable installment to the series that fills in many gaps and answers questions the first two in the series left us with. Which is a good thing. But I really, and I do mean really, would like to see sci-fi producers/directors (and writers!) start considering the notion that having a highly trained and incredibly qualified crew fall apart and become irrational morons when faced with a crisis situation in movie after movie is getting a bit tiresome to endure.

It tries to borrow from the name of the original Cloverfield movie, but only to attract some viewers. A couple of scenes inserted here and there which make no additional contribution to the script or overall flow of the movie, and that's that. There are scenes which make you feel like you are watching a blend of Aliens, Event Horizon and yes, Addams Family ( no kidding!). Although the visual effects are well above average, the director seems to have forgotten in some certain scenes to take into account that when you drop something in open space with no g, it does not drop to the deck. It just stands there or flies away, depending on the momentum of the main body of structure. So, in short, no, even the the notion of physics isn't there.The acting is OK, but the script is... well, where is the script?So, a couple of lines turned into a more lengthier summary, but only out of frustration.To sum it up, just stay away from this movie.

I will try not to spoil anything. But honestly, there is nothing to spoil.
You will follow a group of ""scientists"" that will babble some stuff that might sound sci-ency, but its rubbish. Mostly words put together without any real meaning behind it.They must be the dumbest scientist in the universe. Most of the movie they are fighting/arguing stupid things, and when they need to use logic to fix simple things, they forget science and do the most dumb thing you could do.Physics are completely out of whack in space. I dont mind some wackiness in the movies, but this one just went crazy with it.
I was told to watch this movie because it will explain some nonsense from the previous ones. It does not. You can see some effect to it, but no explanation.Other reviewers say there is a great twist ending... Im not sure which movie they saw.Thats about all i can say without spoiling.Effects, acting, all is decent. The content is the problem.
You might think i hate all the Cloverfield movies, and you are partly right. I didnt like the first one (didnt hate it tho) , the second one was great right until a couple of minutes before ending, and this one.. hate.And yes. I am being harsh with the 1-star rating.

I like space movies, there is a specific atmosphere filled with silence and loneliness there that some movies are able to emulate very well, like the masterpiece Alien. Talking about that, The Cloverfield Paradox brings a good atmosphere, it's believable that that ship is really floating in the space. I gave a solid 8 to the movie, specially because it's really hard to watch a good sci-fi movie after some very good titles that have been created. The sci-fi genre it's not like the action genre, for example, where you can watch the same dumb story again and again and (for some people), get entertained every time. In sci-fi genre, when an idea is used, it becomes really unlikely that that idea will work again. So, in my opinion, if you like the genre, go and watch it.",The Cloverfield Paradox

290,Wrighthead,A confused tie in to the Cloverfield franchise.,3,6 February 2018,"I went into this movie with high hopes thinking I was going to see another great Cloverfield movie. I was, however, extremely let down. The movie itself has a good premise explaining why Cloverfield happened.However, this is the only good thing about the movie. The first Cloverfield movie was set in what seemed to be the present day. The opening scene is of a terrace party where both electricity and food are stable. There was no mention of future tech and no suggestion that the events of Cloverfield were set in the future.By comparison 'The Cloverfield Paradox' seems to be set in a future where there are both electricity and food shortages. This seems to clash with the original movie being set in modern day.My issues with the movie other than this change in timeline also settle down to events seeming to happen at random. Instead of having a consistent theme or antagonist the story is consistently changing who the antagonist is with things seemingly happening at random. If the crew are not being told how to solve an issue in a seemingly impossible way they are dealing with an antagonist that was different 30 minutes prior.Instead of adequately explaining the reasons for Cloverfield or adding to the story line, this movie seems to detract from everything that had built up in the two previous movies and has spoiled the series. It feels like childish writing with characters being flaccid stereotypes and events seeming to happen at random without explanation.The people who made this movie had good intentions but failed to execute those intentions adequately.",The Cloverfield Paradox

This movie is bad, it's boring and frustrating.
There are some good paradox ideas etc but there is nothing new.
The acting is ok and there are some good special effects.
But as for the end wtf i mean wtf was that corny Godzilla all about.
The original Cloverfield was ok, Cloverfield Lane was great cause the twist and ending was not what was assumed and portrayed during the movie.
But this was just too heavy going and boring and never really got my attention.
I honestly felt like throwing my remote control through the tv at the end. Of course we knew there would be a surprise in store on earth 1 for the returning crew but to show that daft Godzilla like that was ridiculous. I think would have been better to show nothing and left to the imagination of the audience what may await - as we knew from folks on earth some bad shit was going down.

The special effects were very realistic. Mostly being filmed in space, it had many different sequences that worked very well together. I loved this film and I loved the way it ended.

But this can't save a half baked plot, unmemorable and shallow characters. The story sets itself in the near future, doing so is a challenge as the director's job is to take the audience to a believable future state. This is the first of many failures in this film. The next is the pointless interactions with the crew and woeful attempts at levity. With PA you expect monsters. PA gives you very, very little in this regard. And given that the Paradox franchise was launched on the way our civilisation would typically handle big monsters, you get virtually none of that here. Most of the dramatic confflict between characters and the elements is completely contrived and uninteresting.

300,dalks78,Typically average from Bad Robot!,5,19 May 2021,"This could have been so good, as the premise is really interesting, unfortunately it fails on nearly every aspect. To be fair first 20 minutes are pretty solid, introducing the issues that the world is suffering from (a global energy crisis and the threat of war, as nations fight for these limited resources). We then get to see the solution, an orbiting space station that has what is essentially a miniature Hadron Collider that's the world's last hope to produce an unlimited energy supply. Finally we get an interesting insight into the multi-national crew and at least here there are some little bits of character development here. After this though when the expected disaster occurs, we unfortunately get an unintelligible and incoherent mess of a plot. We basically get a 'lets see how we can isolate crew members and bump them off' scenario, with little explanation of what the phenomena is that's causing these deaths. This leads to the A-Typical problem with all of JJ Abrams projects, there are too many questions and too little answers given! We then get various action set pieces thrown in to disguise glaring plot holes and any decent substance being established! Finally despite a few subtle hints, the link to the Cloverfield universe is only fully confirmed right at the end. This obviously shows this movies link to the overall universe was probably an afterthought and that certain characters and scenes were shoehorned in to this story to provide a tenuous connection to the two previous movies, then they could use the Cloverfield name to sell it to people.",The Cloverfield Paradox

This movie is for you. It's also a great sci-fi, thriller, with numerous homages to the Alien series.The bad: I think the films plot was rushed at points, it felt a little too much crammed into the end and would have loved to see the very last scene done better. The good: The acting in this film is beyond good, all the actors played their roles phenomenally and really gave this movie originality. The thriller aspects are genuine and grotesque, while the brief moments of comic relief really add to the connections to the characters..

Absolutely nothing makes sense here, everything that could be interesting is just used to drag the viewer to the next horror scene or action sequence. It is not only stupid, it is totally boring. Towards the end I was falling asleep.It is obvious that the authors and the director of this embarrassment never looked into a book about particle physics. They never tried to understand neither the physical basics nor any of the philosophical implications of parallel realities. There are just bits and pieces of two alternate worlds smashed together and the only thing thrilling about it all is how they could get such a story financed.They have good actors, but it doesn't help here anymore.

304,Artifam,A Paradox Indeed,5,21 February 2018,"Without having seen the original Cloverfield, The Paradox can be reviewed on its own merits, and it's a fairly mixed bag. Cutting to the chase and calling this film out for what it is; it's a well presented B-movie. Its plot is a mix of discerning scientific projection (nicely rendered) pitted against The Twilight Zone and its resulting absurdities remain exactly that. It's not clear if its actually meant to be taken as a parody, but clichéd disputes between the space station's multi-national protagonists are exaggeratedly played out soon into the run-time before a quick succession of absurd events takes over with loose foundation and the cast inevitably soon after starts to get picked off one by one in time-honoured tradition. It references Event Horizon, Sunshine, Alien, 2010 and countless other films, and overall it's a relatively fun watch with decent special effects. However, the music score in the second half suddenly seems so overbearingly bored of the incredulity of the whole experience that it regresses to a 1950s score that makes you think you're watching a reincarnation of The Blob, and that's fine, perhaps even fun too, but it's an instant tell for a lame duck that simply can't fly under critical assessment. Part of the failure of this space epic, aside of the dreadful music score (which deserves criticising twice) is that its cast is so widely known in such weightier roles as the Night Manager (Elizabeth Debicki) and Goodbye Lenin/Rush (Daniel Brühl), or comedic roles such as the IT Crowd/Bridesmaids (Chris O'Dowd) that can't help detract from any sense of empathy out of normal character, and O'Dowd certainly shows no effort to break the mold. At the end of the day, the film is sloppy but entertaining enough to not come away cheated, although the end result really is a 50:50 affair that leaves you wondering how badly the film may have tanked on the big screen versus finding a more adventurous audience on Netflix.",The Cloverfield Paradox

Previous Cloverfield movies weren't giving viewer feeling of typical sci-fi. This - does.It feels like when they were filming this movie, they always kept ""Book of all sci-fi movie cliches"" by their hands. However, it's not terrible as it seems after reading all these reviews. I was expecting much more from this movie -true, but there are some mysteries in this universe and The Cloverfield Paradox explain things a bit. I would recommend to watch this if you are desperate to get more information about first Cloverfield movie events. Main issue of Cloverfield Paraxod - it's totally weak movie by itself. If you haven't watched first Cloverfield - this one is just another average quality sci-fi movie.Plot mostly is predictable and characters are empty. I wanted to skip most dialogues to see whats next. It's not science related at all. All movie scenes consist of how characters appeared in a situation that no human ever experienced before, but they are 100% sure how to solve it. Things just work in a magical way.

Short runtime, no name actors and visually appealing. 2 years ago when the ""sequel"" came out, well it gave us a new perspective which wasn't a bad thing. Neither was the casting of Mary Elizabeth Winstead (pause for reflection).But now the studios give us a third installment of the Cloverfield story, and this one deserves a review. It's ridiculous, badly-acted, awful to look at, nonsensical, badly directed, even more terribly produced, over-simplistic storyline and the characters are all barely 2-dimensional, and should have all perished. The link between this 3rd story and the original Cloverfield is thinner than my grandmother's underpants and smells worse. I'm not going to load this review with spoilers because the movie doesn't deserve such attention. Matt Reeves and JJ Abrahms are listed as Exec Producers, and this must have been nothing but a chance to earn some shopping money from Netflix - if they had any creative involvement in this rubbish movie, they need to retire from the movie industry. The director, Julius Onah, delivers sci-fi clichés one after the other, and i would encourage any movie studio who has made a sci-fi film in the last 30 years to lawyer-up and sue this guy for blatant plagiarism. This was his mess and I hope he owns it.In short, there's nothing new here. Nothing exciting. No story plots to keep you entertained.

It's my unfounded belief that in some parallel universe, Netflix just might have dropped a good version too.Quantum entanglement. The god particle; and it's implications as a clean and everlasting energy source. Multiple dimensions. A rip through the fabric of space, capable of unleashing monsters from places unknown - These are just a few of the concepts thrown around that ultimately had little barring on the story. As I look back on the premise of the movie now, it's like looking back at the wedding vows spoken by a gold digger after the divorce has been finalized; a lot of exciting words and ideas were thrown around up front, but that's about it.The third installment of the Cloverfield series was pretty lackluster. This film almost entirely took the monsters out of the equation and chose to focus on the causality of the creatures' invasion, as opposed to the ensuing battle and aftermath that the first two tackled. This was a good idea in theory, but in reality it came off as post hoc and the explanation for how and where they came from (the entire reason for this films existence) got lost in the process.I can't say it was awful; the scifi concepts (window-dressing, as they may have been) actually did a pretty good job of keeping me invested and intrigued, but it definitely wasn't the best in the series - and given its company, that's saying something. There were moments of redemption and genuine thrill but the default was a movie reminiscent of a video game cut scene.The final few minutes were the highlight of the movie, which makes sense: their aim was never to make a quality movie, but rather to sign us all up for the perpetual next installment. Still, this was somehow the best movie released this week and it's, more or less, free.Prescriptions

I'm definitely a fan of the Cloverfield movies, 10 Cloverfield Lane being my favorite, but i also really like Cloverfield. This film However dissapointed me. The Cloverfield films have always tried to be original but this mess of a film just gave up. The acting ranges from horrible to average in part due to a poor script with thinly written characters. Other than that this is a by the numbers sci-fi film. 
The only thing that saves it is it's connection to the Cloverfield universe which i also the only reason i wanted to watch it. If you are a fan of this universe you could be entertained, but don't expect the quality of the first two films.

It explains but sadly it didn't explore. However, I still did quiet enjoy this film. It felt like I'm watching Aliens and to some degree it reminds me of Life (the one's with Jake Gylenhaal and Ryan Reynolds in it) especially with that last scene.I think the cast was great particularly the black leads Gugu Mbatha-Raw (Hamilton) and Roger Davies (Kiel). It's quiet nice to see Zhang Ziyi working again in Holywood (I'm also excited for the new Godzilla movie), it felt like she didn't aged a day after Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. I also think Daniel Brühl and Chris O'Dowd did a good job in this movie, they both pop out in this diverse cast, though to be fair all of them did a great job portraying their characters. And lastly, I gotta say that Elizabeth Debicki is really a stunner, I've been keeping an eye on her since I saw her in The Great Gatsby and I really think the she's a great actress.Overall, I hope that this franchise still continues. I would love to see what's going to happen next. But of all three Cloverfield movies, I think that in terms of casting this one is the strongest but story wise it felt like it could have been better.

But the journey can be dull at some points, as the characters, besides the main one, aren't fully developed and things that happen are just plain weird, out of place, which was the point of it, but I had wished they'd go a little farther with it, as the plot opens up any possibilities they can think of, and yet they seem to have restricted themselves.It's a great beginning for the Cloverfield universe and a unique kind of story, in spite any cliches others point out (you can't avoid using any nowadays), also seem to be some who clearly didn't follow the story or filled in the gaps on their own, as it does not use an overly amount of exposition in order to catch you up. It's more like Alien and Predator, it keeps things a little open for the audience to interpret or understand by themselves.If you've watched the other two and liked them, I will suggest it, as even if you do not like it, you get some background.
If you like movies like The Core, Event Horizon etc then I really think you will enjoy it, the other movies are not necessary.

327,CoffeeLatteWriter,Not Bad At All,6,5 February 2018,"It's pretty much what anyone might have expected from a Cloverfield film set in space: a cross between Life and Aliens -- nothing more, nothing less. Mostly predictable plot, a few surprises and scares, but great acting nonetheless. In a way, the film was a disappointment in that it could have been tremendously better, but sci-fi fans shouldn't be disappointed, providing that they're looking for entertainment above a smart, well-crafted film.Some gripes are about the beginning -- which was a bit haphazardly done, and the ending -- it was expected for the film, but could have gotten there much better; it was more or less forced in just for the sake of tying it to the original Cloverfield film. Elizabeth Debicki's character was a highlight, although a lot of people might not be huge fans of her role in this considering how poorly her character was set up throughout the film.All in all, watch it for entertainment and some mild Alien-esque scares, but otherwise the reaction you'll be left with at the end is ""meh.""",The Cloverfield Paradox

331,ashleyjohncontact,Too 'average' for Cloverfield,5,5 February 2018,"When I heard this movie had dropped on Netflix I was initially excited, and then suspicious. With the first two movies making so much at the box office, why go to Netflix? To make the movie available to all? To shake up the system? Or, to hide from the fact it is the weakest entry in the franchise to date?Cloverfield is a unique franchise where each film can be whatever they want it to be. The first was a shaky-cam found footage monster movie, and the second was a highly conceptual paranoia bunker thriller; both worked exceptionally well. With 'Paradox' we are taken into space to try and stitch together the first two movies and explain how the monster mess started in the first place (a story that works better on paper than on screen).From the very beginning, this movie feels very 'paint by numbers'. It's cliched, lacks character depth (for example, all we know about the main character is that she's a wife and has children) or originality, and relies on well established story tropes. It's 'Alien' meets 'Gravity' meets 'Black Mirror' meets 'Doctor Who', but without the charm or the depth. Once you figure out what is going on, the story doesn't deviate from that well-trodden path. Nothing revolutionary or surprising happens, which is a shame because Cloverfield works best when it is confusing and shocking.'Netflix Original' is the new 'cool' way of saying 'Made for TV but with a little more budget'. This movie would NEVER have worked at the cinema; it's just too average. Netflix dropping this without any previews or warning is a clever way of getting every Cloverfield fan to watch it before they hear a thing about it. It's good for a 'Netflix Original', but average for anything Cloverfield related. After watching 10 Cloverfield Lane I was shocked and surprised by the story risk they had taken compared to the originaly 2008, but after watching Paradox, I was left feeling empty and a little bored, and wishing they had just left it with the two movies.Fans of Cloverfield are going to watch this regardless, and most will probably lap it up, but I suspect once the Super Bowl hype has died down, the reviews will start to reflect the average quality of this film.Bonus: the ending is VERY JJ Abrams.",The Cloverfield Paradox

At first it seemed quite slow but then when Earth disappeared it became more interesting. As things began to happen, I took on board that because two realities had crashed together, it was only right that there would be coincidences.
The tension built nicely through the whole thing. I wasn't expecting monsters except for a verbal clue that splitting dimensions could possibly let them in. I dismissed this and went with paradox. Killing off all but two of the crew was slightly cliche as a lot of movies do that but when the ending came I was only expecting something like a third Earth to have been caught in the rift. 
The last few seconds actually made me shout out loud. It was brilliant and awful.The horrible realisation of consequences of events that had made me feel the plot was working towards a good ending were stripped away in a second. I would have rated it 7 but too many people had admittedly rated it according to the relationship with previous Cloverfield movies instead of as a stand alone.

335,bennyantlang,Pretend It's Not A Cloverfield Movie,5,11 February 2018,"10 Cloverfield Lane got away with it's bait-and-switch marketing tactics because viewers were suckered into seeing a really good movie, so they weren't too mad about it. Unfortunately, this is not a really good movie, so I can see why people are so disappointed. But it's not a bad movie either. For all its flaws, it can be an enjoyable watch - and it's the ""hey look it's Cloverfield!"" scenes which hold it back more than anything.
A lot of things about this movie don't make any sense. Many of the sci-fi aspects are never explained, and most of the horror moments contradict all logic. On a wider level, you're left wondering why such a great cast was wasted on this spacecrew of one-dimensional characters. But the biggest question of all is why JJ Abrams chose this movie to tie in with his Cloverfield franchise. Was it simply because the movie was ripe, low-hanging fruit which Paramount was struggling to bring to market without a big name attached; a big-budget sci-fi horror with no real hook? Probably. The Cloverfield-centric marketing certainly got people talking (which works against the movie as it doesn't live up to the hype). But Abrams couldn't have chosen this film because of its plot, which in itself is fine (in a brainless, just-enjoy-the-show kind of way) but doesn't relate to Cloverfield in any conceivable fashion; reshoots were done to show how the space station's experiment causes massive explosions on Earth, which in turn release the Cloverfield monsters, but the connection between the experiment and the explosions is never explained, because it can't be. The space station disappears into an alternate dimension, so the world starts exploding? I get that interdimensional travel can cause chaos, but I doubt any scientist would attest to the possibility of it releasing ""demons"" into the world, as suggested by Donal Logue's awkwardly-shoehorned-in crackpot talking head, delivering some fanservice foreshadowing in the movie's opening moments.
My suggestion would be to ignore the Cloverfield connections and take the movie for what it was meant to be - a fairly generic space horror with a philosophical twist which is never fully explored. Does that sound like it's worth your time? Maybe not. It does give Gugu Mbatha-Raw opportunity to display her considerable talent with an emotional monologue to ""herself"" near the end of the film (this and Chris O'Dowd's one funny scene are the movie's most redeemable moments). The acting & production values should be enough to elevate this from a passable movie to a decent one - I've certainly seen worse films of a similar ilk - but the insufferable Monster Mash scenes drag it back down to average at best; not a classic, but not unwatchable. Cloverfield fanboys and science nitpickers will hate it, but anyone else might find something to enjoy here.",The Cloverfield Paradox

It seems that for him is more important diversity and making clear that the representatives of the USA and UK in the station are blacks that a good script. Apart from that, The Cloverfield Paradox, in a way, reminds of 2010, astronauts in an international space station while on earth a war between their nations is about to start.

A lot of those reviews argued that the timeline doesn't fit. Well folks its in the title. 
Think Star Trek the next generations final voyage on TV where an anomaly created in the future gets larger as it goes back into the past and caused Picard to jump timelines. 'The Cloverfield Paradox' has a similar concept. Earths energy supplies are running out, astronauts are sent to space to test a for an infinite energy source. In doing so they rip through space and time, they are plunged into an alternative dimension, meanwhile the monsters arrive on Earth. This is ground zero, 2028. The monsters appeared for the first time then but also 2008 (the original movie), whenever Cloverfield Lane is set. Similarly 'Overlord' yet to be released which is set on the eve of the D-Day landing. The timeline is meaningless as they can arrive whenever in time and everyone will be surprised because for them it will be the first time. 
My biggest disappointment with the film is they didn't go darker along the lines of 'Event Horizon', some scenes were simply played for laughs such as the arm, which made zero sense, other scenes like the worms bursting out of a corpse felt like a play on 'Alien'. 
The cast were all brilliant but more could have been made of the script. For a film that has been consistently delayed due to rewrites it could have done with a little more time to get right.

348,dvd4040,'The Cloverfield Paradox' fails to entertain!,2,8 February 2018,"Going into 'The Cloverfield Paradox', which should be renamed to 'The Cloverfield Potato', I was a huge fan of this movie universe and its mythology. With 2008's 'Cloverfield', I loved the use of handheld cameras and the found footage aspect to tell this crazy story of a giant creature wreaking havoc on everyone and everything in New York, despite the annoying characters. Some years later, we got a film set in the same universe with '10 Cloverfield Lane', which had us holed up with John Goodman and couple other great characters where something terrible was happening outside their underground bunker, just as something equally awful was happening underground. JJ Abrams had announced a third film some years ago that would take place in this 'Cloverfield' universe, but went thru many delays and a ton of titles, including 'The God Particle'.
In a genius move though, the first trailer for the film played during the Superbowl, which said it would debut right after the game on Netflix. A surprise indeed it was, but after viewing the film, disappointment set in with just how lazy and horrible everything was in a film franchise that had everything going for it. With an amazing cast from all over the world, including Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Chris O'Dowd, Zhang Ziyi, Roger Davies, Aksel Hennie, David Oyelowo, Daniel Brühl, Elizabeth Debicki,and John Ortiz, and a great movie universe to draw inspiration from - filmmaker Julius Onah and his writers failed miserably.What 'The Cloverfield Paradox' does, is take a ton of other sci-fi films' plot lines and scenes and mixes them up into its own jumbled mess of mediocrity. If you were to name a few films 'The Cloverfield Paradox' takes its cues from, 'Event Horizon', 'Alien', and 'Interstellar' would come to mind, but there are countless others that come into play here, but the best parts of those films don't translate well here. Maybe, because it feels rushed, lazy, and unoriginal, not to mention that all of the characters have zero backstory, with the exception of one character, while everyone else is the one-note stereotypical space crew environment, including the comic relief, the doctor, the short temper, the boss, and the weirdo. Set on a space station above Earth, this space crew is trying to harness and energy to help Earth out with the low energy levels in order to survive.When the space crew succeeds, it happens to transport them to another dimension with no Earth in sight. Strange noises, random people start yelling from within the walls, chests burst open, worms fly out, and more start to happen aboard the space station. Meanwhile, on Earth, well see the first 'Cloverfield' movie, as two dimensions collide. The cast is perfectly capable of being the best they've ever been, but due to this script, nobody is given any one moment to shine other than one-liners. There are moments where the film seems to be going into dark and balls-to-the-wall territory, but it always stops short.In fact, if the film were togo all the way so to speak, it would have been a much better movie. There is no relation to the other 'Cloverfield' films other than some half-assed sub plot and the final moment of the movie. None of it makes sense and feels like a marketing push over the biggest televised event of the year to surprise us with something we didn't really want.

Not only did the astronauts/scientists travel to a different dimension but they caused a tare in the space time continuum which resulted in 10 Cloverfield Lane happening in one parallel universe to ours, Cloverfield in another, or multiple - (remember how they were watching news footage of their crashed space station in the other dimension and how there was footage of it on the camera at the very end of Cloverfield in the background of coney island?) They were in another dimension that also encountered the Cloverfield incident. In some alternate universes the Cloverfield incident occurred where in some it did not. Who knows what happened in the other dimensions? Maybe that is what we will see in the next films; how all the parallel universes were affected by this event.

But unlike the previous two movies, this one fails to deliver.I did find it interesting how they brought the God Particle story to the Cloverfield universe, but that is it. There is no in depth story and character development, and the only anticipation building to the story is the one of a very predictable ""villain"" twist, if we can even call it like that. 
Every part of it feels rushed and just thrown into context, and the movie feels like just a side-story to something much cooler happening that we do not get to see.In a way, this is the problem with Hollywood nowadays. The story is just too shallow, the characters are poorly developed and there is not much guessing to where the story going. Also, the small details: A German character named Schmidt ... ok, just very cliche. And Brazil is somewhat of a popular place, so it is not too hard to do a short and quick research to learn that ""Acosta"" is not a Brazilian Portuguese name, but rather Spanish, and not even that popular. But anyway, just a small example of how Hollywood movie stories are just poor and lazy (sans a few great film makers).Not to say everything is bad in this movie, it is still a Cloverfield story and the acting is quite good most of the time. Daniel Brühl and Chris O'Dowd are well known and really good actors, and of course they deliver in this one. So, to sum up: If you really really need to get more on the Cloverfield story, it is an ok movie at best, but nothing that you wouldn't get from spending 2 minutes reading a plot summary, instead of the 102 of the whole movie.4/10",The Cloverfield Paradox

They tried too hard to shoehorn things into the movie that identify it as Cloverfield, such as the bunker from 10 Cloverfield lane. The problem is they gave away the tie in 15 minutes into the movie with the exposition that during the particle accelerator would rip apart reality not only in the present but throughout time and multiple dimensions.However to make sense of the 3 current films (and any films to come) you really do have to watch the whole movie. Ignore the undercooked plot with Jensen trying to kill Zimo amd steal his work. Ignore the senseless decision by a supposedly intelligent Hamilton to stay in a universe she doesn't belong to. Just know that Cloverfield has now become an anthology. None of the movies need to tie in directly because they've given themselves an out. As I see it the original took place in the viewing present. 10 Cloverfield lane was also more or less the present but in a different universe. There were aliens attacking in that universe instead of monsters. The bunker and the John Goodman character exist in the universe in Paradox, but most likely in the Paradox universe Goodman isn't a psychotic serial killer. In Paradox, the home universe is most likely the same as in the original film except its far in the future.

As soon as you start watching this film, you get the feeling that you are watching a science fiction B-movie, with a few good actors thrown in (same feeling I got while watching The Vault, and noticing James Franco was in it). Except that this is a Big Budget release. Or is it? Because everything seems to have been made with a low budget, and, unfortunately, that includes the script.Yes, the script is horrid. Most of it involves people inside a space station, where bad things happen after they activate a particle accelerator. Space and time are torn apart (and so is the plot), and they end up in another dimension, and monsters are transported to Earth. What kind of bad things happen? Well, someone loses an arm, and the arm can move around by itself and even write on its own. How? It is not explained. And, of course, some people start to die. Reality has been seriously altered. It seems the movie found a way to throw ideas randomly into the film without having to explain them any further, like one of the characters vomiting maggots he never swallowed. Cloverfield Paradox successfully turned the script into a paradox. It answers nothing about the previous Cloverfield movies. In fact it does not even seem to belong to the same universe.

You can see the suits around a board table: Good marketing - check, forced connection to a somewhat popular cult fiction universe - check, Russian 'villain' - check, CGI - check, hey look at how much multiculturalism there is! - check. 
Let's make some money, don't worry, its just Netflix subscribers we're talking about.Poor acting, terrible unlikable characters, patronizing crap 'science' jargon and explanations, basic disjointed plot, couldn't decide whether it was SciFi or a spooky supernatural plot (some awful scenes which there was not even an attempt to explain), and the forced Cloverfield element is just the flies on the turd.Once upon a time this would have been 'Direct to Video', it seems that in 2018 this means 'Direct to Netflix'.",The Cloverfield Paradox

Certain lines didn't need to be there, mostly because we can understand what is happening through the visuals or lines previously mentioned. It's only like that a few times though so I'm not going to trash the movie for that. Overall it was interesting and very well done except for the very last shot, which looked tacked on and could have ended a few seconds earlier. It could have been much worse though, and I can say I'd recommend this.
(EDIT): I have been thinking about the movie now and it makes me really question how this is supposed to connect to the first movie other than a quick bit.

The acting was great, the effects, setting and approach (the thing with the body horror) were nice, too, but as the movie progressed it just went along the line of boring horror movies that end ""by the book"" just like last year's 'Life'.I thought the movie was shot and directed pretty nicely, but at one point it became bloated with plot holes and things just thrown in the movie, which were hardly ever explained. All in all, it kind of ties into the whole Cloverfield universe and it truly does provide the possibilities for other movies, but does it really answer the questions the other two movies left us asking? No, not really. And I do have to say that I barely cared for any of the characters besides Hamilton, which contributes to another issue I had with the movie - its writing there was lots of exposition delivered in a very lazy way and I also found some parts, including the humor, to be quite forced. The whole movie almost felt crammed in its runtime, with a pacing that I feel should've been slower.Honestly though, putting aside all the flaws this movie has, I do think it was a fairly enjoyable experience for me and I found myself invested, at the edge of my seat if you would, throughout the whole movie (more at the beginning, less at the ending).

I never heard of Cloverfield and did not know that it was some sort of series until I started reading some of the other reviews on this page. Having no prior knowledge of Cloverfield, I was able to approach the film without any preconceived bias and judge the movie entirely on its own merit. There are very few films that present any truly unique science-fiction idea, but this movie does succeed in blending some old ideas into a new and unique combination. I found this to be a very enjoyable science-fiction film. Although this movie had its share of scientific inaccuracies, I simply attribute them to the fact that the story takes place in an alternate universe where our scientific laws do not all necessarily hold true. This is an unusual science-fiction tale, blended with a touch of horror similar to ""Event Horizon"". The plot is very interesting. The acting is excellent. The special effects are great. The story is suspenseful. I found this film to be a worthwhile piece of entertainment.",The Cloverfield Paradox

411,nweller,IMDB ranks them correctly,3,17 February 2019,"Having seen 10 Cloverfield Lane and Cloverfield prior to watching The Cloverfield Paradox, I agree with IMDB in ranking them in the same order. And the rating gap between the first two and The Cloverfield Paradox is well-deserved, although it should be larger.There are considerable differences between the first two parts in the series, but they are both very enjoyable in their own way. If you ignore the expensive actors and the ending, 10 Cloverfield Lane was done using fairly simple means, left so much more to our imagination, and yet worked remarkably well. Cloverfield took place much closer to the threat and had more action and special effects, which also worked well for me.Both emphasize realism. They feel very credible. From the start, The Cloverfield Paradox takes a very different, very Hollywoodesque stance instead. It begins as a typical American space mission film. We build a hero narrative - a hero is needed to save Earth - do the typical family separation, sadness and hope thing, and then move on to a typical space mission setup and execution. More special effects and a lot of permanent epic background music.That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I found that the film ends up working with these off-the-shelf elements while failing to deliver a credible or even interesting plot. At some point (the ""arm"" scene) the film completely dropped the ball for me and it was clear that it wouldn't recover. It continued with many rather ridiculous leaps of logic and failed to engage me.If you liked the other two Cloverfield films, you'll probably have to watch this just to have done it and make up your own opinion, but it's nothing like them and you don't miss out on anything if you skip this.",The Cloverfield Paradox

Skipped the 2nd, since I like Sci-fi but not Captured-in-a-cellar movies. Also, with Cloverfield Lane it seemed clear we should take it more as a production company collection than as a series of related films.Now, the 3rd movie with that C in its name is back to Scifi, with a vengeance! and without a connection!Now, I relly like bleak indies and semi-indies like Love (tt1541874) (2014), Moon (tt1182345) (2009), Europa Report (tt2051879) (2013), the Swiss movie Cargo (tt0381940) (2009), Air (tt2091478) (2015), and more far off, Another Earth (tt1549572) (2011).This movie is not really like any of these, but kind of related -- perhaps it's in the same coordinate space if you will. It is Scifi that adds some twists here and there, though they can't of course completely break out of the Hollywoo stamping molds.Cloverfield Paradox has elements of one-by-one like Sunshine (2007) and countless others -- though in a flippant way. There is some mystery, some horror feints but neither scary nor comedy - more quirky.
Oddball. And on a space station.So all in all a decent watch, with all-star cast (Crouching Tiger! IT Crowd! Niki Lauda! ...) doing decent-to-quite-good jobs of their characters.

The story, dialogue, characters, sets, acting, directing and soundtrack are all very believeable, real and authentic without stretching the boundaries of reality too far. The only thing about the characters that threw me off in the end is how scientists could and would and are presented as being over emotional and reactionary instead of having there logic & rationality take over in their decisions.

I expected nothing and was positively surprised to like this movie more than most people apparently do.What annoys me, is that a lot of people give this movie shit for missing logical explanations and not explaining everything that is going on by scientifically correct and accepted theories, but those same people give every super-hero movie a 9/10, that have the same problems.This a JJ Abrams movie and JJ doesn't give a shit about logic and accuracy. He presents a premise, that could work and then puts all his weird, unexplained stuff on top of it to make it more mythical. Clearly this strategy worked a lot of times, so why stop now?Most of what Hollywood produced over the last ten years is borderline cliched, illogical, pretentious and downright stupid, but they raked in Billions this way, so at least some of you pay for this crap (and seem to like it very much!).I liked the intro and first climax, where the hell is earth? And of course the crew is panicking. They are tense and frightened, locked in this space station for over two years. A lot of people (back on earth) believe, that what they are doing could end all existence, so maybe, just maybe you snap, when something seems to confirm your worst fears.They couldn't navigate and determine their position because of the missing gyro-thingy, another chance to fuel the panic well taken.Maybe Im more used to the whole dimensions-colliding-and-weird-stuff-happening, but to me the premise was quite clear. Reminded me of the great Event Horizon.After the space station collided with another dimension (not universe!), all hell breaks loose and very strange things start to happen. Here it starts to feel a little bit like Donnie Darko. You are not supposed to mess with other dimensions and the crew is experiencing this first hand ""This dimension is eating us alive!"".Very typical JJ here! Take an accepted scientific theory (multiverse, dimension travel, etc.) and garnish it with some religious, mythical evil (your not supposed to do that, the other dimension ""defends"" itself). Either you go back to your own dimension where you belong, or you will be destroyed.People have no problem with Cthulhu appearing out of nowhere in the first movie, but an arm eating wall it stupid? Does anyone here know, what happens if two dimensions collide? And to top it all of you have people arguing about the science in this movie (just why even start?) and cite wrong facts by themselves (the water freezing scene was great and would work exactly like that. who locked her in and started the water flow? we will never know and we don't have to).",The Cloverfield Paradox

430,RichyRichFerguson,Cloverfield Paradox Spoiler Free Review,4,7 February 2018,"It goes without saying that the 'Cloverfield' franchise itself has cemented itself as a cinematic universe similar to a compilation of 'Twilight Zone' episodes.It is important to highlight the successes of this movie. Where a film tries to enter itself in the middle of a franchise as a middle instalment or prequel, while not directly referencing the rest of the films directly or inherently is quite a feat. That seems to be a reoccurring theme in this series; to try and distinguish each film with some sort of phenomena without making clear ties to how it revolves around the others. This film in particular however, showcases a clear sic-fi aesthetic, taking from relative and modern day type setting. The set design and building of the atmosphere was not quite as fine tuned as some sic-fi thriller masterpieces, but this felt very specific to itself and most definitely genuine to itself. Also interesting to mention was the acting and casting of the titular roles. The crew was very diverse and they usually, not always, but usually sold their roles in a dramatic fashion. In addition, the constant juxtaposition of the two stories wore itself as some way to keep the movie going forward when there was no real reason to. If they dropped the husband's perspective and his sequences, then nothing in the film would have changed. It adds some minor (emphasis on minor), contextual evidence as too where in the timeline of the Cloverfield universe the movie actually resides. Now maybe I might have a soft spot for this film but, I think more than anything its simply because it entertained me with its simple direction and frenetic editing which kept the film paced evenly for its modest run time. That being said, the film clearly does not take the time to understand what exactly it is. The movie films as if a paradox of itself, whereas the plot takes elements from several different versions of script and then threw the elements together in a strange half-baked experiment. The film takes the time to tell the audience that the science that drives the paradox is simply an amalgamation of two alternate dimensions, which is feasible in its own explanation; simple enough, never is the case. The plot takes so many left turns on itself where key elements become almost cruxes or a deus ex machina. It comes off as clumsy piece of storytelling nonetheless, but even more so is the contrasting role of obstacles for the protagonists. It feels early on in that science is the main antagonist. Where the two worlds colliding, destroys both intersecting pieces involved. That's the easiest way to say it without revealing any spoilers to the film. What happens later appears as the ship intervening as being alive or an sentient. The ship without any explanation changes shape, or assimilates people and body parts without giving any reference or science as to why. The science of the movie in the script is sloppy and is not thoroughly explained or even refined to truly understand what it really is. There are also some plot devices that seem almost too inappropriate given the nature of their existence. Granted the notion of space and survival, there is a three dimensional printer that creates food for the crew onboard, which seems simplistic enough in nature and not too far out of the realm of reason. What is puzzling is why a character should be allowed to create a weapon from the same device that only moments before was making a bagel. The themes and goals of the film also seem fairly conflicting. Everyone in the movie wants to save humanity in their own way, but after the twist is revealed, the antagonist somehow does not believe them even though her goal is the same. Also, it baffles me how Chris O'Dowd can remain as calm as he is, when a tragic accident occurs to him. I thoroughly enjoy him as an actor, and agree he has a comedic charm to him, but his character undergoes so many physical, and psychologically traumatic events that his optimism and lack of human morality appear very disheartening and strange. To summarize, the film as a whole holds up as a disposable and interesting in premise addition to the already strange Cloverfield universe, but this specific instalment fails to understand what is under the surface. On top it plays as a sci-fi thriller, but the science and thrill are lost in an improbable conclusion where the key elements and characters fail to explain or refine what they are trying to be.",The Cloverfield Paradox

The Brazilian character has the surname ""Acosta"", a typical Spanish surname. The common thing for Brazil would be ""da Costa"" or ""Costa"". A problematic mistake for a film that only lent itself to please a globalist agenda instead of making a good art.

Unless you never watched any sci-fi, ""particle accelerator"" = multiverse = anything can happen.
So I watched this, expecting to be surprised, and then the movie ended... The 1st movie was not original in any way but it introduced found footage and it was well done. Here it not only lacks originality, it's just random things happening to antipathetic people that react in absurd ways until they die without you ever feeling concerned about this.
Apart from acting and visuals, all is really bad. They are scientists but they feel stupid and unfocused all the time, except one guy that magically discovers all what happened, just like that, because it was needed at this point of the movie. Before that the rest of the crew lock him somewhere, just because we don't want him to reveal this terrible secret too early in the movie. You know, this terrible secret, it's just that particle accelerator can crash dimensions of the multiverse (woooow). It was that, or a dream all along, maybe they threw a dice to decide.
Besides this, no one wants to see a Cloverfield movie about scientists and a particle accelerator.

438,lentzzachary,Terrible Terrible Terrible,2,6 February 2018,"I don't even know where to begin. I've never seen a movie with such a stupid premise be executed so poorly, and I've seen the Boss Baby.This is a movie that seems like it wants to be a typical space horror film. Great. That's what it was marketed as. And the marketing worked on me. I went in completely blind going based only off the premise, what I'd seen, and a faith in Netflix to deliver quality content. Oh boy was that ever a mistake.This film's horror is never explained. Instead what seems to happen are random events happening randomly to random people with random effects to them, e.g. a dude getting his arm amputated yet feeling no pain nor bleeding out and the arm gaining a mind of its own. This was given no precedence in the movie. There is no internal logic to this movie. Things just happen.The crew seems to be made up of some of the dumbest individuals alive. People who do not communicate with each other but instead all go off and do their own things. The command structure seems to mean nothing as a crew member who was made a prisoner leaves with no repercussions and it seems as though the script never cared to resolve that little issue.Also, the part that got me incredibly confused was the gun. On the ship one of the characters uses a 3D printer to create a gun. You know... While I'm skeptical you could make a firearm that would be very functional using a 3D printer, whatever fine, it's the future so things happen. But WHERE DID THE BULLETS COME FROM? The guy puts bullets in the gun, they're made of a glassy/white substance so I guess it's implied he 3D printed them as well, only those bullets wouldn't be able to shoot because they need gunpowder which is not something you can just 3D print! And the entire crew is shocked that there is a gun on the ship, so it would be just as stupid to assume there were bullets on the ship but no guns. So stupid, so agonizingly stupid.The actors are bad. The actress who plays Hamilton is nearly strangled at one point, yet the face I'd say she's making during this strangulation is closer to bored. None of the actors were good. They were at best passable and at their worst abysmal.Oh, also, the blatant pandering to the Chinese audience was the dumbest thing I'd seen in quite a while. So the one Chinese crew member is many things, beautiful, ridiculously intelligent in more than just her assigned field, was a badass, and also was the only character who did not speak English, which seemed to be the crew's default language. Yet despite her lack of fluency in spoken English, she could understand her fellow crew, who had accents varying from standard American to Russian, and they could understand her. So were they using translators or was everyone fluent in both Chinese and English but no one had the heart to tell the Chinese girl that the language was English so they just ran with it? You tell me. The only answer I have is, say it with me now, blatant pandering. Quite literally the only thing I can give this movie props on is its special effects. While they weren't anything special, they were competent. Though they never made the ship stand out in the sci-fi genre, they did not make me think the actors were on a soundstage. So kudos to the set designers and SFX artists who worked on this film, you guys are the superheroes here.Man, I don't want to sound this negative but this film has literally nothing to offer. A cool concept doesn't get brownie points. Good ideas earn nothing if they are executed poorly. This film only gets 2 stars because I did not sit through to the ending and I am giving it that leeway in case it is so incredible that it turns this film back around and makes it movie of the year. Going based off a few other reviews, though, I think it's pretty safe to say that I'm not missing much.",The Cloverfield Paradox
439,tuszadorjan,"Reminder: this title is part of something bigger (I'm just a geek from Hungary, not a publicist.)",8,5 April 2018,"Hi there,I strongly disagree with all the ratings below 5. People are also saying it is not even connected to the other movies. Which is also not true. You don't even have to force your imagination to see how...I'm also unsure what people expect from low budget sci-fi movies, but for me all the 3 movies so far delivered a unique experience. And they are coherent, no matter what others say. I don't need my schools to get this. :PThis is exactly the title you should ONLY watch, once you watched the previous two before. In my opinion, that is how it delivers the full experience and makes you want a series made out of this. I love how each of the titles put something additional into the bigger picture. It is a pure sci - fi experience, and it is ways less bullshit than Annihilation was with Natalie Portman. I'm saying this because people were praising that movie for it's pure sci - fi feeling and said all the unexplained bs there is part of the experience.
Now here we have way less bullshit happening, with some cool humor also hidden between the 'dramatic' scenes, and people keep criticizing it for the same reasons they were praising Annihilation.Watch it for you yourself, consider the fact it is part of something, not a standalone. And just enjoy. If they keep continuing with the same steps by bringing out more like this in this universe, I'll be the most happy sci - fi geek in the world. :)Yo!",The Cloverfield Paradox
440,CorpusTristis,Surprisingly enjoyable,7,1 June 2018,"Honestly, I found it quite enjoyable. Even though none of the freaky events (such as the arm with a life of its own) were ever given a clear explanation, I found myself intrigued and excited nonetheless. The idea of dimensions mashing together leaves a lot to the imagination, and since the mysterious workings of this are never fully explained, I can see this film being unsatisfactory for those who desire an airtight plot. I however, was willing to except that weird stuff was occurring, and considering it is just a film, I found it perfectly adequate when Schmidt' says ""the longer we stay here the more dangerous it is"", which was the writer's way of explaining away the seemingly random behavior on the ship.Some of the ""dimension-switching"" moments I found to be outstanding, such as when a woman ends up within the walls of the craft, pipes and wires running through her body. That was very dark and honestly quite creative, and when this apparent stranger utters Hamilton's name, it added a level of intrigue I hadn't felt from a film in years.This film would have worked ten times better if it had detached itself from the Cloverfield franchise. If you can't envision Paradox as a standalone, you'll just find yourself facing even more unanswered questions. The monsters are mentioned and briefly shown, in order to tie the film in with the first installment, but they are never properly addressed. Perhaps the next film in the ""Cloververse"" will fill in the blanks.The emotional elements of the film did not land well. I found myself unmoved at Hamilton's desire to see her children again, and I didn't care for the events occurring on Earth, probably because they didn't show enough for it to amount to anything. Perhaps if they hadn't shown any clips of Earth, and adapted a theme of isolation like in ""Alien"", they could have pulled it off. The Cloverfield Paradox follows Alien in many ways already, but not particularly successfully. We could have become much more attached to the crew if we had seem them chatting and being happy, such as the breakfast scene of Alien. I didn't find myself particularly invested in any of them.A final thing to note is the unnecessary alienation of the one Chinese character, Tam. None of her lines are in English, even though it's evident she understands it. This was a redundant and impractical move on the director's behalf, and seems to be a poor attempt at showcasing diversity, or possible (as many speculate) appealing to a Chinese audience. Either way, it didn't work.",The Cloverfield Paradox

The Cloverfield space station, crewed by an international team must test and ensure the work of a device to solve the crisis and avert impending worldwide conflict. The paradox arises as in addition to creating an endless source of energy, the use of a particle accelerator might also rip the time space fabric. In other words, the collision of particles with anti-matter might may give way to a multiverse of commingling realities in which matter would break physics laws, people's alternate selves might communicate, and prehistoric creatures would roam the earth.CGI gives life to a sentient arm and allows the unsuccessful hybridization of man/worms, in a sort of Gilles Deleuze's Animot, and man/technology, as Donna Haraway's Cyborg, to dramatize the conundrum faced by the crew. The movie could be shorter as some dialogues, family issues, and suspicion against the Russian and German astronauts just stall it. The protagonists are African American and that is certainly a plus.

457,viddyd33,I could have watched Norbit,1,6 February 2018,"I swear this was written by a 10 year-old. A few quick examples roughly in order of occurence:1) ""The world is almost out of oil and everyone is going to die if we don't find this theoretical energy."" I guess solar, geothermal, wind, and hydro-electric solutions don't exist in this universe. Plus it's the future, these technologies would almost certainly be much further developed/implemented by then to boot.2) Within 10 minutes some random dude pretty much says, ""If we conduct this experiment we could have monsters rise from the sea in the past!"" Uh...kinda specific there, buddy. Almost like you've seen Cloverfield.3) After the experiment goes awry and all the station's systems shut down, they can't detect Earth...and half if not most of the crew of scientists automatically assume it's because Earth disappeared. Not because, you know, the systems are down.4) After confirming the Earth was gone they didn't think to use the stars to find their location until way, way later. Maybe I just don't know what scientists are.5) When the Russian is thrown on a table and immediately dies, you hear a flatline. He was never connected to any equipment. This is one of the only enjoyable scenes.6) Many drug trip-esque random events that have nothing to do with anything and don't even jive with the ""different realities smashing together"" theory. Example: a guy for some reason gets his arm sucked into a nonsensically morphing wall, the wall takes it off painlessly and spits it out, then the arm comes alive with a mind of its own ala The Addams Family (or Evil Dead 2), writes down ""Check the dead Russian's stomach!"" and in his stomach they find the exact battery they needed to do something.7) Example 2: a tank full of worms loses only all the worms and they suddenly appear inside the Russian, killing him as mentioned from before. This, and many other stupid things, aren't ""random events"" but would take intelligence (or stupidity) and coordination to pull off. Though the woman appearing in the wall was kinda cool.8) Wall Girl, who suddenly appeared from another universe, has to wear another dude's uniform because hers got chopped up in the wall's wiring. Good thing it's fitted perfectly for her size and shape. Future clothes rocks.9) Wall Girl doesn't know Asian Girl because SHE (Wall Girl) is the alternate universe's Shepherd (experiment name) engineer. But later she (Wall Girl) says that Main Girl was never on the ship in her alternate universe because she (Wall Girl) went on the mission in Main Girl's place. Main Girl and Asian Girl have completely different jobs. This one's a thinker but it's a nice fat plot contradiction, even in a movie with alternate universes.10) Favorite line: ""Shepherd smashed a Higgs Boson, overloaded, somehow ended up here."" I bet they just looked up trending science topics on Twitter and injected them randomly in dialogue, because these are just words.11) So why did the metal glue grab the guy and stick him to the wall? And don't say the unexplained magnetism because that was pulling consistently in one direction and to achieve what happened it had to succumb to the magnetism then (after grabbing him) somehow completely resist the intense magnetic field and suck him to the wall like a monster, even though all the other metal did not experience this effect.12) A room filled with water is instantly completely frozen when exposed to space, but a room filled with air exposed to space doesn't see as much as a speck of frost although water's thermal conductivity is way, WAY less than air's. Go science!13) A group has to manually eject a giant spinny thing so the ship doesn't explode. The commander heroically seals himself in with it to eject it easier. A crew mate yells, ""No! We can do this remotely!"" I love it.14) The miscalculated Shepherd experiment makes a bunch of random chaotic things happen including sending their ship to a different universe. How do we get back? Press the button again, make more more random chaotic things happen and of course it'll perfectly transport us back to the spot we came from but change nothing else.15) Main Girl, before transporting back to her original universe/Earth, sends a message with constructional and operational plans for the Shepherd machine (what they're in space experimenting with) to hopefully save that alternate Earth's fuel supply. Though Wall Girl from that alternate universe/Earth is there to begin with because she's on the same mission, in the same space station, with the same device that malfunctioned. I think they forgot.16) And best for last: They never say what ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" is. Do they mean the chance of multiple universes colliding? Because that's not a paradox, it's an effect. This supports my hypothesis that they just picked fun science words to scatter about.",The Cloverfield Paradox

461,mars-wink,"""Event Horizon"" Meets ""Sunshine""",5,5 February 2018,"Although ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" is technically the third installment in the ""Cloverfield"" universe, it functions primarily as a soft reboot/retelling of the first film. The movie's basic premise is that the world is running out of energy, prompting developed nations to build an experimental particle accelerator capable of generating limitless power (presumably through fusion). Due to concerns about the device's potential dangers, it is housed on a space station crewed by a small group of scientists. The crew is tasked with completing the device as the world below descends into strife. This set-up is quite reminiscent of ""Sunshine"", and indeed there are similarities in the progression of the plot. As the crew experiences the dangers of meddling with quantum physics, the film takes a turn toward ""Event Horizon"" with elements of body horror and breaking the boundaries of our reality. While nothing revolutionary in terms of ideas, the movie has some memorable scenes and is generally well-acted. There is a subplot involving the disaster unfolding on Earth which is under-explored in my opinion, although I suppose that is the realm of the original film. Overall, ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" is a competent sci-fi space survival movie. I would not recommend it to ""Cloverfield"" fans looking for a continuation of that story; rather, give it a watch if you liked ""Sunshine"" and ""Event Horizon"" (though this does not top those films).",The Cloverfield Paradox

However, essentially from the first scene, I realised that this was going to be a glorified TV movie. There are some decent performances, and as above the themes behind it are fine, intriguing even. But the execution, for me was unacceptable. I'm no scientist, but I know things don't operate the way this movie portrayed them, see other reviews for gravity stupidity for example. Every time we got a shot of the space station, I kept thinking, how would you get from one spinning ring to the next? Perhaps someone cleverer than me already worked that out. Why am I fixated on that? The universe is about to fold, the very fabric of time and space ripped open, but yeah, how do you get from one ring to the other.Hamilton really wants to do something, ""Can I do it boss"", ""NO THAT WOULD BE ALL KINDS OF WRONG, NO WAY!!"", ""Please, I really want to"", ""Ok then"".The whole Mundy character was so wrong as well. I like O'Dowd, but he might as well have been wearing a flashing neon sign above his head that said, 'comedic relief'. Why would the wall react like it did in the 'arm scene'; the whole thing with the arm, abysmal. To paraphrase, ""Hey, my arm saved the world"". Get off, get off my TV. Why do movies with such deep, and in this case apocalyptic themes have to cram in a joker? I dont get it. His demise; why would the substance react like that? I genuinely didnt care about the Michael plot. Entirely useless. ""Hey, my phone doesn't work, the one I'm texting you on, can you get a message out"".......... ""ok, yeah I've done it"", ""phewf, thanks"".The doctor can't do an autopsy, what? Cant bring himself to do it. Dont worry, one of the physicists will, cool thanks. Shut up. There's bits of Event Horizon here, hints of Pacific Rim, Gravity and Life. Movies that have covered the ground far, far better than this. The very final shot, I mean, gimme a break. The whole subtlety throughout the movie (one of it's plus points) is blown out of the water with about $100 worth of CGI, and in no way leaves me hanging for the next instalment. This didn't take me on any journey at all. It didn't take me up, down, didn't scare me, didn't worry me, didn't make me tense, didn't make me happy when things seemed to take a turn for the better, didn't make me sad when folk were getting popped off left and right.

The Cloverfield Paradox is not good.The premise is actually pretty good, but the film doesn't capitalize on it. The setup is more akin to Event Horizon than anything in the Cloverfield franchise, and if it had been allowed to develop, we could have had something genuinely interesting. As it is, there isn't much creativity here. Any sense of gravitas is lost as a haphazard series of events unfold, with no seeming logic connecting the plot. The elements that connect it to Cloverfield feel shoehorned in (which is unfortunately exactly what happened).The acting itself is B level, but the writing and direction lets it down even further and brings this into the C or F range.If you're a fan of the Cloverfield franchise, I would suggest reading a plot synopsis, and hope the next film is better.

When the movie is over, I feel most viewers will feel that they've wasted time on on a story that could be completely conveyed through a 3 minute movie trailer. From the science and technical perspective, the movie is very flawed. The station has artificial gravity, presumably because several parts of it are spinning.

You may consider that a spoiler. I consider it a warning. THIS IS NOT A CLOVERFIELD MOVIE. This is a piece of crap. This is a movie so bad, they decided to throw in the Cloverfield monster in the last 7 seconds of the movie so they could put Cloverfield in the title, to make more money off of it. However, they obviously then realized that as soon as reviews came in from critics, and word of mouth spread about how abismal it is, they wouldn't make enough money, as everybody with half a brain would avoid it. So, they sold it to Netflix.Now, just in case you for some reason want to watch this TV movie pretending to be something else, SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT.So it starts off, not even 5 minutes in, with terrible expository dialogue. The characters are all horrible, and despite all working together for the last 2 years, they all act like they hate each other. Throughout the film everybody resorts to violence and fighting rather that talking things through. Nobody reacts to anything either with logic, or even as a real person with somewhat faulty logic. There is a scene where a man loses his arm, and the reactions from him and the other characters with him are hilarious. Nobody freaks out about any of the insane things happening throughout the movie. For instance, a woman they do not know gets trapped in the wall, and they have to cut her out, as she has power lines running through her, which should have killed her, by the way. Nobody seems to want to question her and find out what is really going on. It's just odd.The science of the ""film"" is also very wrong. First off, if firing the machine caused them to go to another dimension, and there's is suddenly a new crew member aboard, shouldn't there be duplicates of the other characters as well? Also, even if the film did that, that itself would be a flaw. If that new character and the character that doesn't exist in her dimension's crew both have different lives, then that would mean everybody would. So she shouldn't recognize anyone. The existence of the machine itself in another dimension is a plot hole. If one person has a different life, then all of them have to, because this implies that their experiences in life are different. Keep in mind, we are ignoring the fact that their existence at all in an alternate dimension wouldn't work due to people being conceived at different times, due to different realities, which means they would be completely different people, not even looking the same. Anyways, the film then implies that everybody else is the same as in the other dimension, but that means that your interests and mental makeup are predetermined from birth and not completely influenced by the world around you and your experiences as you grow up. I want to get away from this now and talk about another HUGE plot hole. If by some miracle they fire the machine and it's takes them to another dimension, that means that if one other dimension exists, that an infinite amount of other dimensions HAS to exist. You might even be able to look past the huge coincidence of them ending up in one in which they still exist (even though their duplicates are missing), but why would they assume that firing the machine again will take them back to their own dimension? Again, the existence of one alternate dimension means there has to be unlimited other dimensions. Honestly, I could go on and on about this crap, but I don't want to. This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. They don't even explain how the aliens came to earth. I thought it had something to do with the paradox, but that's never shown to us. To be honest, I was quite bored and didn't pay the closest attention to the second half of the movie, but I doubt they explained it and I just missed it. The only thing I saw related to the Cloverfield universe was, again, a 7 second shot of the monster roaring before the end credits rolled. I'm done, I hated this movie. 20/100, and that's being VERY generous. What a way to start my film experience for 2018.",The Cloverfield Paradox
471,NerezzaAU,A Not Terrible Sci-fi FIlm,8,14 June 2018,"Just finished watching this movie and checked online to see what reviews were like. Shocked to find the negativity this film has attracted. Sure, if you go into this expecting Cloverfield 1 you're probably going to find fault with it. I will agree I really don't like this trend of adapting other movies to fit the franchise but as a sci-fi on its own I enjoyed this movie. People seem to be complaining about breaches of realism etc. - get over it. It's a movie, not a documentary about real science. As someone who grew up on the classics such as Alien, Event Horizon etc this is a movie that holds its own in the same breath. Forget the Cloverfield aspects of it and enjoy the movie for what it is.",The Cloverfield Paradox
472,ampjr-59923,Not as Bad as you think,8,13 February 2018,"Considering the birth of the internet being integrated into our lives and the onset of millennials into our society you would think every movie sucks. And the ones they say are great you find terrible. The movie is not perfect but I found it rather enjoyable, and it kept my interest throughout that I was sad to see it end. Its like most Sci Fi movies that take you away from normal life and make you believe that one day maybe what you see will be the norm or plausible. Long story short give a shot you can always stop watching if your interested but like myself I'm sure you'll want too see why and how they ended up like they did. So quick go turn on Netflix and watch it and if you get bored Archer is a click away lol.",The Cloverfield Paradox
473,kevinlienhagen,"Not great, not bad.",6,25 June 2018,"This is an overall good movie, especially if you like sci-fi and thrillers. Acting, special effects and filming is done perfectly. It clearly has a big budget, big names and big effects. However, this movie falls short in the story. It's confusing and all over the place. The events in this movie are great, but are performed mediocre and don't come across as meaningful. You won't care for any of the characters as you don't get to know any of them. Lastly, I want to say that it feels as though this world was made for making a good movie - not realism. Don't expect this to represent humanity, logic or actual sciene.

477,paulharris-14451,"Good sci-fi, some silly bits",7,16 August 2018,"I enjoyed this film. The casting and acting was pretty good, though the whole earth story arc around Michael was disconnected and felt like it was tacked on to try and link some other plot items together (though I thought his acting was good). The whole Cloverfield thing passed me by, and watching this stand alone I thought the last few seconds of the movie were just utterly silly, but I understand now why it was ""shoehorned"" in. Jensen's character seemed really ""thin"", and her motivations seemed pretty obvious right from her introduction into the story line. Her ""twist"" wasn't really very much of a twist at all. However, none of this should take away that it was a fun, stand-alone sci-fi watch. On a final note, it seems a bit of a shame that there are a great many reviews for this film on IMDB that suggest that anyone who doesn't like this film is stupid or a troll. Movies are art, art is subjective. Just because someone has a different view from you doesn't make them dumb. If everyone thought the same, what would be the point of ratings, the point of reviews?",The Cloverfield Paradox
478,iiviixiiviix,"A great Sci-Fi film with its flaws (Re-edit, this movie is so bad)",3,5 February 2018,"I love the Cloverfield series, it is by far one of my favorite things to follow! I can't tell you have many hours I've spent reading and watching videos about this series! If you are just like me or even somewhat interested, I say watch this film. It has a looot of nods to the Alien franchise for sure, and I am sure I'm not the only one to notice.I have a lot of problems with this movie, more than I originally had until I thought about the film more. Some characters felt kinda flat and a little boring in contrast with their counter parts. The acting is either boring and uninspired at times as well. Some of the shots/cinematography (while amazing throughout the film) can sometimes feel boring or something they just put together. Some events and plot points and things that happen to characters feel rush and seem to just happen. Not to mention the film can feel predictable at times. This movie actually has little to no plot, and the ""plot"" that does exist is very generic and not made better in any way. A lot of the ""serious"" moments come off very comedic when I'm sure that isn't the intent. Characters die for no reason at all as well. The Cloverfield aspect seems to just be thrown on too, of course it was though. Because, every new Cloverfield movie is a script that wouldn't be made otherwise. So, they throw on the Cloverfield name and add in a bit of nods and references and there ya go. It takes place in the ""Cloververse"". I do have some good things though and these are why I feel like the movie is worth watching!:
The one scene where the guy on the news explains how this connects the other films in the movie. Also, how comedic some of the scenes can be.I could go on for a while about this movie and is subtle meanings/imagery and influences but I won't do that! I say watch this movie, especially with someone that love Sci-Fi and the topics it tackles or a fan of the Alien franchise. But, if not skip out, this movie is pretty bad. The ending is cool, I guess, but is kinda funny. I know I said this movie pays a lot of nods and references to great Sci-Fi films but really I think its just a mesh of all of those films cliches and not so great moments.
(One last thing, I really wished they played with the colors and lighting more! They had so many chances for amazing and beautiful shots/scenes!)",The Cloverfield Paradox

The cloverfield paradox is a great space station sci-fi with a great cast that shows us more of the universe we have come to love.
If you're looking for a direct story from either of the other 2 movies this is not for you. However if you're a fan of the cloverfield universe you'll surely enjoy this movie.
As I said the only negative aspect of the film is it sometimes can't decide if it wants to be a comedy or a serious sci-fi, but it's only in a few scenes and it detracts nothing from the overall great and satisfying story.

487,jornthomasdufey,What a waste of a franchise,2,30 September 2018,"So, this movie was supposed to be named ""God Particle""; but someone thought it was a good idea to stick the Cloverfield name to it to give it a broader audience. So if this seem only vaguely related to the original Cloverfield movie, there's your reason.Then again, the second movie in the franchise, something something cloverfield lane had the same issues (original title renamed with the Cloverfield name for a broader audience).EIther way, is the movie any good?
Here are my pros and cons.Pros: 
The Effects are decent.The plot is sometimes hilarious.It's a braindead movie, so you can probably surf on your phone, do your taxes or play videogames while this movie runs in the background, and still get the plot.Cons:
The acting is awful.Plot does not make ANY senseExample? Okay. 
So lets say i make a movie about being stranded on a desert island with a friend. Suddenly a palm tree starts talking to us. It tells us to dig a hole in the sand. And so we do. We find a treasure map. The treasure map leads to a cave. Inside the cave there's a bottle of water. We drink the water. Now we can hold our breath under water. Yay, now we can swim home.That's what this movie is like. It does whatever it wants, as long as it gets the crew home. Nothing makes sense. Nothing. Think that plot of mine was far fetched? Well, watch the movie and let me know which was sillier: my plot, or the movies.Or you could do something even smarter and do something more constructive with your time. Like sleep.

This ""story"" is essentially a bad clone of a number of Star Trek stories, and is not told as well as any of them.

493,chrispy_shrimp,"Okay. Not bad, not good.",5,2 November 2020,"Everything about the film production, cast and acting is great! Now, the story is actually good but i feel it just wasnt a good fit for ""cloverfield"" series. It is mentioned that this story was originally its own idea and turned into an excerpt for the Cloverfield franchise and probably would've been better as its own stand alone film.This is where the movie becomes mundane and something we've seen time and time again. It pretty much plays out as almost any ""stuck on a space station"" style movie. People acting overly irrational without trying to assess or evaluate whats going first or even taking a ""whack"" at the possibility of how the situation has changed due to a dimensional shift as what happens in this movie. Then you have the almost everything that can go wrong, pretty much go wrong with alot of things unexplained or ignored. I will say we can plausibly sweep it under the rug because it is mentioned that because of the dimensional shift anything can be possible and this is unexplored territory in space and time, but i will also mention that because its a ""paradox"" all the bad things could be held to paradox correction or one dimension trying to eliminate the existence of people or things that do not belong there, but i'll leave that to you.Whats bad is they already mention this paradox idea at the beginning of the movie. After things initially go bad, and they find Jensen, no one stops to consider the idea of a paradox and how careful they should actually be. Along with almost zero explanation as to how the creatures ended up on earth other than tying it to the Shepard Collider and an archived video of Donal Logue saying that it could unleash ""demons.""Overall, it's watchable but like the other cloverfield movies, it just seems like they want to focus on stories that surround the creatures and actual incident than just make a movie or series about the actual creatures which seems like the one thing that would make a good movie and story especially if it was a series.",The Cloverfield Paradox

The grisly results of 2 parallel universes inhabiting the same space were well done without being TOO upsetting - but upsetting enough.The connection to Cloverfield becomes apparent at literally the last moment (last 4 seconds) of the movie.I must assume any viewer thought or said 's**t, for real??? Dudes!' :(",The Cloverfield Paradox
495,NekoDani,Cameofield,6,8 February 2018,"Beginning of the movie was a bit slow, but that's forgiven because, like 10 Cloverfield Lane, there initially is no link at all to the Cloverfield universe (sans the name) so they have to set it up as a stand alone film. I both like and dislike this aspect of this universe. Small nit pick I'm just going to have with these movies so we can move on.The characters are set up well with some nice acting talent present. The story is fairly straightforward other than being a bit heavy on the Hollywood complicated science-y talk. I'm no physicist, but they dumbed down an incredibly complex process and then made it complicated again with science fiction movie lingo - again, small gripe. This was actually kind of nice by way of avoiding the cliche trope most paradox movies fall prey to of being so up their own ass about being a ""smart"" movie that it takes part of the fun out of viewing.There's a nice sense of urgency present throughout the film in both the space and the Earth scenes. Yes, we go to space in this one. The normal space movie staples are there, but I don't see us getting away from those anytime soon. Despite that, I enjoyed the journey into a totally different space (HA!) like we did with the previous film. We get to visit a familiar place mid-film, but I would have liked more of this than the small taste we were given.I'm sure you've noticed that I've written three paragraphs about a Cloverfield movie without once mentioning a monster. That's because the monster(s), well... totally secondary to the story here. Both good and bad. When we finally get a monster, it's a nice little thrill. But again.. when we finally get a monster, it's a nice *little* thrill. To be completely honest, take out about three scenes and this wouldn't have even been a Cloverfiled movie.My biggest problem with this movie was the ending. I almost expected JJ Abrams to wrap this story up with this installation. He most certainly did NOT wrap anything up. In classic Cloverfield fashion, we were left with more questions, however, they were questions that don't seem to really matter. I felt the urge to know more from Cloverfield and 10 Cloverfield Lane. The Cloverfield Paradox can be summed up in the title. It's a paradox so don't ask.With ALL of that being said, I still really liked this movie. I know it sounds like I'm ripping it apart. I probably am. I'm only doing this because I wanted to love it. I think maybe I DO love it. What mattered to me here is what makes me love the Cloverfield universe - I had a fun ride.

The only thing I didn't like about this otherwise perfect movie is they didn't really explain what happened to Jen and why she wasn't in the new office.
I loved it that the creators are not afraid to burst into 2018 with such a strong statement as Moss' gender reassignment surgery. It is also weird that he managed to adopt the exact same kids in both universes. That's what Cloverfield Paradox most likely is hence the name of the movie.

The reviews for this film convince me even more that something is just not right here. I no longer believe ratings at all. I would encourage all of you to ignore them an judge for yourselves.For example, Star Wars the Last Jedi was apparently very highly rated by the critics even though it was the most appalling garbage I have seen in that franchise.By contrast, this film is being given terrible ratings, and yet having just watched it, I simply don't understand the scores.The acting was excellent, there were moments of genuine emotional turmoil, tragedy and conflict. Plenty of action, a very decent plot that amazingly provides a plausible connection to the other films. There was even a subtle injection of humor, but done in a very realistic way. The film takes itself seriously and carried me with it entirely. My disbelief was indeed suspended!!!The special effects were actually terrific with sets and props made to a very high standard and not something I expected to be as good from a movie released only on Netflix.Whilst not a direct sequel to Cloverfield in terms of style, the film absolutely ties in and in fact brings together the whole franchise. It provides and explanation of what caused the original monster, and the alternative aliens we saw in 10 Cloverfield Lane. It also opens the door to any number of future possibilities.Many have criticized the film for not being scientifically accurate. I'm not claiming this film was perfect. There were a few things not explained, heaven forbid we use our own imaginations a little, but your dealing with cinematic interpretations of quantum mechanics. Does anybody fully understand that? I think a bit of artistic licence is entirely acceptable.There are people giving this movie 3, 2 or even 1 star????? Its absolutely outrageous. I can only conclude that their understanding of theoretical physics is too weak to get this? I guess if you saw it expecting to see a direct follow on monster movie, you might be disappointed, but as a Sci Fi movie in its own right, the film was superb.I think they have done something very clever with this series of films. The are all extremely diverse and yet connected. I look forward to the next installments with relish.",The Cloverfield Paradox
516,JohnnyQuid1,'What are you talking about arm',1,9 February 2018,"Oh wow this was bad. The quote above about the offending appendage should tell you that this is a joke of a film and not a funny one at that. I'm a pretty big fan of the original Cloverfield film and consider it something of a classic in the found footage and giant monster films out there and 10 Cloverfield Lane was also decent, leaving the series in a nice what happens next state. This, however never should've seen the light as a Cloverfield movie or any other movie.A bunch of astronauts are trying to save the world but end up losing it, is the premise, as described. But they inadvertently travel to a different dimension, where there is an alternate earth. 'Whatever earth that is lets just go there' or something to that effect says one of the crew members. A woman from the other dimension gets stuck in a wall somehow. Irish astronaut guy loses an arm. Arm wants to speak and is sentient apparently. Russian astronaut eats some worms for some reason that are on the ship for some reason. Chinese lady astronaut speaks Mandarin to the other crew who can understand her and in turn speak English to her. I could go on with more non-sensical and bad ideas but why? Do they get home? You won't care. Nor is it interesting. I think this was written by someone deliberately trying to make a bad movie. Self-paryoding bad movie experiment?? I have no idea what they were thinking. Netflix is well known for green lighting virtually everything but they should've drawn the line here. One of the absolute worst movies of all time and surely a dead cert for the razzie next year if they cant include it for this.",The Cloverfield Paradox
517,ringwaull,A decent film held back by formulaic tropes,6,6 February 2018,"Overall the movie is not terrible and has some interesting ideas that it incorporates (though not to any really satisfying degree), but if you've played Half Life and watched Event Horizon then you already may well have seen the film. The special effects are very well done except for the laughably bad final seconds which by all rights should not have made it into the final cut. Character motivations are often questionable and the strange physics seem to happen solely for advancing the plot, as though god/the universe is making a directed effort to screw with them on purpose rather than having any natural ""randomness"". Probably would have been a better film if it didn't try to shoehorn in the Cloverfield IP.",The Cloverfield Paradox

Sure I agree that the direction and logic in the story was a bit lackluster but i would call it better than average. If this same movie had some big names in the cast I am sure lot of these moaning people would shut up about the movie being a disaster.I was hooked onto every second, although some stupid things like monsters appearing on earth and guy's hand getting sucked and acting up on its own were utterly stupid because even a physicist would deny such things happening in another dimension or Universe.

It has the name Cloverfield in the title because parts of it relate to Cloverfield. Like 10 Cloverfield Lane, the connection really doesn't matter to the movie itself. The actual tie-in for this film is more interesting than 10 Cloverfield Lane, but the core of this movie is your standard (these aren't really spoilers) something-goes-wrong-in-space movie and you get to choose which characters die in which order. The score I gave may not be high, but I enjoyed my time with it. Being on Netflix, I didn't have to pay theater ticket price to see it which means I get to leave the film thinking, ""that was sci-fi. There was science. And fiction. And space. And wow I really didn't care that much about any of the characters, but at least there was space.""",The Cloverfield Paradox

It's just kind of there....The characters are meh, and I couldn't tell you one of their names if you paid me. The monster is non existent, and you just get random snippets of it groaning. At one point some woman just appears stuck to the pipes inside the ship with absolutely zero explanation of why she's there.

529,tkiziewicz,I had to chime in on this,6,6 February 2018,"This opinion comes from a lover of films, including a big fan of the original 'Cloverfield' and a passionate film maker (not famous) myself. I don't normally jump onto IMDB to write reviews, simply to background check some of the people involved to help my god awful memory with names, but... this film did something to me that I feel deserves a comment. NO SPOILERS, MUCHO OPINIONS.I have self deduced using my extensive knowledge on film and from previous experience with the franchise, judging by the theme, style and mood; this is supposed to be a science fiction horror. Well, it totally failed to scare me. At all. I can feel fear rather easily when I want to and I tried, I really did. My biggest emotion, well more like sensation, was confusion, which was only covered up or distracted at times by sheer disbelief and the feeling of questioning my own mentality that I was still watching. There were however several keen moments of tension that were really working for me, a sense of dread and impending doom reminiscent of the early 90's, but alas. It turned out to be more like that moment of waiting for the toaster to pop, only you realised you put the kettle on instead, like a doofus. Wait a minute, I have an orange juice right here, what the hell am I doing? The only reason I even came to the kitchen was to get a sandwich. Screw it, I'm going out. ALIEN! I am personally disappointed, more-so because I feel 'Cloverfield' and '10 Cloverfield Lane' provided so many options and this just feels like no one has the balls or the budget to step up to the task, or chance an original idea. We're left with these cut and paste jobs that circulate ideas to match fan bases and expected content to secure an audience. I'm not sure who to blame for this. Ourselves as the media hungry viewers that cannot consume enough meaningless information, the writers that are slave monkeys to form new ideas that match the old that don't challenge our basic intelligence too much or too little or too aggressively, or the director for having to create a visual reality that makes some sense of a story that has been eaten, digested, regurgitated, chewed again and cooked with bland vegetables that the producer likes on Sundays. The glorious part of this whole performance for me was the acting cast. Bravo. The moment I was introduced to the cast near the start of the film I saw faces that I knew and respected, despite being slightly baffled by the collection. It was as if I had attended an alcoholics anonymous meet at a mystery location and we just all came together as better people. Somehow, despite a large amount of the dialogue being somewhat predictable, weak and poorly imagined, the actors managed to bring something to every part. None of it made much sense in the grand scheme of things, despite the supposed narrative you have been told, but it certainly felt like everyone was having a lot of fun with it. No one ever seemed to lose heart or give a crap that it was meaningless dribble leading to another boiling toaster being left on. And in the end, neither did I.TLDR: This film is crap. It's utterly, ridiculous franchised crap. And by god, I enjoy some of that crap. Mucho gracias Netflix, this would have been a truly AWFUL cinema experience, but from the luxury of my favourite spot with some OJ and a good sandwich on a lazy night, I fully enjoyed this rag tag bunch of supposed scientists fall victim to... well, it is a Cloverfield film. Who the heck can tell what? If you're bored and slightly insane, give it a crack.",The Cloverfield Paradox

So much promise....I also had hoped this would tie into 10 Cloverfield and the original Cloverfield, but alas...I think worst part was the last 5 seconds of the film, too.

(did it get its own royalty cheque I wonder and if so in which universe was it cashed?)All in all, as I picked the proverbial curnel from my molar, I finally reflected that a film like Cloverfield Paradox can only cause me to hope that there are indeed alternate realities where I didnt waste my valuable time watching such amauterish dross.Maybe, somewhere out there there might just be a universe where this film was not made.........But then there would be no review....or popcorn.A paradox indeed!",The Cloverfield Paradox

Till the very end, I kept wondering where are they going with this, and they did deliver.I am loving how they explore the cloverfield universe from very different, unrelated point of views. I really hope they keep doing this.As for the haters who claim that this movie has plot holes and full of bad science, I just want to say that this is a freakin movie and not a rocket science lecture.

535,shawnandmax,Somewhat disappointed,4,7 February 2018,"While I have seen all the greats (and even the B and C sci-fi's), this reach from NETFLIX was slightly disappointing. Characters were interesting (although not developed enough), but the concept was not developed enough either.STOP READING HERE IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT !The concept: A lab that is in orbit around earth is trying to start a stable particle beam in order to (somehow) provide unlimited free power to earth. Earth is nearly in a state of war. After several failures, they eventually manage to start a stable beam..for a few seconds. For whatever reason (they give ventilation as an excuse) they split a Higgs-Boson particle (this is funny and laughable). Apparently ventilation in space makes all the difference and prevents splitting Higgs-boson particles. Because of the particle split they transform into a new universe. Strange things happen because of the paradox (people,etc). But, during the last 20 mintues......apparently the paradox is turned off.....because while they are trying to re-initiate the particle beam and split another Higgs-boson particle (because OBVIOUSLY this will absolutely return them to this universe) no strange things happen. The crew that is left (2) return to our universe, and escape the station in an escape pod. No one has told them that while they were gone the nasty aliens appeared on earth. While they transferred to another universe, apparently there were some nasty aliens just waiting at the exact right spot (who knew exactly what these stupid humans were doing) that transferred to OUR universe. OMG....they decide to try to take over the earth. The earth in the parallel universe (alternate universe?) did not mention anything about aliens. Figure that out. While entertaining, there are many flaws. Read some good sci-fi. Can I suggest some? Arthur C. Clarke, Robert Heinlein, Philllip K.

The 2 stars i gave it are for the special fx team that made the outer layer of the space ship and for the production team that made the interior design; unfortunately either the cinematographer or director opted to shoot every scene with a shallow depth of field so you could never really get a good look at whats going on in the background.The direction was very stilted and bland but it was the writing that ultimately made this so awful. The exposition was so heavy handed and forced it felt like the actors were breaking the fourth wall and straight up talking to the audience for nearly a quarter of the movie. From the first 15 minutes, seeing the cringy relationship of the main character and her boyfriend whos only purpose was to explain to the audience what was happening on earth, i knew what kind of movie i was getting into. Even though every couple of minutes someone was blatantly explaining what was happening, the events of the film were still very confusing & the fake science mumbo jumbo that the writers must have googled before throwing this together just made it more confusing.The acting fluctuated from decent to questionable but its honestly hard to critique the performances when they had such unnatural dialogue to work with. The script felt like a mash up of a bad black mirror episode & every space survival movie, all put together by an entry level film student. I know my critique sounds a little harsh but it pains me to think about how producers will throw 26mill into a production and end up hiring amateurs to lazily throw together the screenplay. Movies are subjective and thats what makes them great, but cmon people, a line has to be drawn somewhere. Considering the plethora of identical space movies that have been around since the 70s & done much more effectively, i truly don't understand how people can watch this and not feel insulted by the utter laziness of the filmmakers.",The Cloverfield Paradox

The space station looked awesome, it was cool, I even liked the color of the instruments and the lighting throughout. However, although the station was spinning, the artificial gravity was not even remotely mimicked properly. No pun intended, but relative to the centripetal momentum of the stations and the various compartments, the direction of the gravity was in the wrong dimension.Ex2. The instant freezing water in the compartment that for some reason blew open... Although space is in fact cold, the zero pressure vacuum of space would actually cause the water to almost immediately vaporize... Now imagine how cool that would have been!?The point here is that in 2018, fake or poorly executed science in a high budget film like this, is inexcusable.

The only issue I had, was a bit of wooden dialogue right at the start. Apart from that, I thought this was an excellent film. Conceptually, perhaps it doesn't break entirely new ground, but I think that this particular slant on ideas that have been touched on elsewhere, is actually quite original. Particularly I like the way this film draws together the threads of all the films, and brings an identifiable centre to the events that we now can see span the Cloverfield multiverse. I cannot think of another film franchise, where the films are effectively happening simultaneously, interrelatedly, in parallel universes. I have no idea why people can't see the originality of this, and it matters not one bit to me that perhaps this concept was concieved along the way. Conceptually it holds water, and stylistically, the film fits; and a wider story is emerging, that I personally can't wait to see more of. Nice work.

Chris's character himself feels like he warped in from a funnier film (maybe not a better film but definitely more funny). Elizabeth Debicki's character is a magician, lets get that out there. from when she warps into the ship (great scene) all the way through to her being killed alien: resurrection style (not so good scene), she constantly knows whats happening and for no reason and decides to be evil AND our main character decides to go back to earth to tell her self something she could do by messaging it (She does this any way). the idea of multiple dimensions sets up a film for disaster if not properly explained. this film sets up the rule that there are no rules. this means that literaly anything could happen to the Cloverfield franchise. gimme a silly interstellar staring Chris O'Dowd already.",The Cloverfield Paradox

I held off on watching it l until October 2018 because of the bad reviews. Man was I wrong. I'm a movie buff and have really enjoyed Cloverfield and Cloverfield Lane. The only thing that is bad about this movie is that it has nothing to do or very little to do with the prequels. I was excited to find an explanation to the other two Cloverfield movies but this movie wasn't it. That and the forced ending were the only dissapointments and reasons why I haven't given it 9 Stars.The movie starts with the great premise that Earth is running out of energy which will lead to WWIII and a crew is sent into space to test a massive particle accelerator to create energy. A little sci-fi but totally believable since countries always fight over energy supplies and since a very strong particle accelerator called the LHC exists in Switzerland. The LHC in Switzerland needs to be cooled at temperatures exceeding -271°C which is colder than space, thus the need for the team to be sent into space to test their particle accelerator in the actual movie (lightbulb turns on).The events unfolding will make your skin crawl, will make you chuckle and will make you gasp as you try to figure out what the hell is going on on the creepy spaceship. Furthermore, the acting is performed extremely well by a familiar and talented cast.

Main-girl in space now manages to go back to this alternate-reality earth. Then... the movie ends. Hello?

577,clay_more79,"A lot of potential, good actors.. but mediocre writing and an awkward tie-in to Cloverfield",4,26 March 2021,"The Cloverfield Paradox really could have been a great movie. There is a lot of potential in the premise, the budget is very decent and there are some really strong actors in the movie. Unfortunately, the movie is hindered by the lack of a clear direction, some very mediocre writing and a really bad tie-in to the existing Cloverfield franchise. The premise itself is great and interesting, a space station is desperately working on fusion energy to solve the Earths' energy crisis, an energy crisis that is slowly pushing the nations of Earth towards a third world war. The experiment goes wrong and the space station is transported somewhere else, with funky extra-dimensional problems arising from their sudden trip. The premise is very similar to that of Event Horizon. Now, the problems faced by the crew come from three directions. There are problems caused by the distrust and internal conflicts in the group, there are problems caused by the phenomena that transported them, and there are problems caused by the damage the station has sustained. The issue with having problems coming from three sources is that it can be very hard to properly develop the background for these problems, as is evident when issues arise minutes before their conclusion. With that many potential sources for problems, it's hard to really develop a narrative that explains these problems. For example, suddenly condensation is brought up as a problem, and a few moments later we find one of the crew trapped in a locked room that's filling up with water. The condensation has never been mentioned before, it isn't an established issue, and it is poorly explained. There's no explanation for why the room suddenly fills up with water. Then, an airlock is opened and for some bewildering reason, the water and the person trapped inside freezes instantly. Of course, this is absolutely not how space works, while space is cold it has next to no mass and thus it takes a really, really long time to freeze anything. It most definitely won't freeze someone in an instant. It really feels like a moment that is.. well.. ""Because the script says so"", and not a naturally evolving moment. There's no real lead-up to this problem, no real explanation, it isn't established much in advance. It just feels like the script decided that it was time for a character to die. The phenomena that comes from their teleportation is also very poorly explained. Lots of interesting things happen, but there seems to be no real connection between them, no real sense or logic behind how the phenomena operates. Earthworms appear inside a persons body and causes him to change personality, an arm is decapitated but remains functional (who exactly is controlling that arm? No intelligence is claimed to be involved in the phenomena). Monsters appear on earth, for some reason. If the phenomena was random, those monsters would be just as likely to appear in any random spot of empty space. It's exceptionally nonsensical and random. Now, being nonsensical and random isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the movie is set up to be a bit more hard sci-fi. Also, the various occurences seem to be all over the place, tonally. I just couldn't figure out what tone the movie was going for. Some of the sequences with the severed arm are extremely humerous and almost slap-stick, some sequences seem influenced by body-horror, some scenes are very dramatic and others scenes try to delve into the science behind the events. The movie does a really poor job of handling the different tones, and you're never sure what you're supposed to feel at any given moment. A man exploding from all of the earthworms inside him is treated as part horror and part comedy. A man loosing his arm is treated purely as comedy. A woman freezing to death is treated as drama. It's really all over the place. If you want to remain tonally consistent, you have to pick a tone and then stick to it, always keeping it in mind. You can deviate from that tone, but you have to do so carefully, at the appropriate moments. Alien is a horror movie that has moments of levity (especially in the beginning), but it sticks to its horror tone once the bad things really start happening. Evil Dead is a comedy movie that always has its comedy in mind even during the more horror-oriented scenes. The primary tone is always present. In Cloverfield Paradox, I've got no idea what the tone is even supposed to be, as inconsistent as it is. Another problem is the tie-in to the existing Cloverfield franchise. This movie shouldn't have been a part of that franchise. The tie-in takes the form of a series of scenes taking place at a completely different location than the main plot, and these scenes have absolutely no bearing on the main plot. It's essentially two stories happening simultaneously with no connecting tissue. They very evidently brought back Gugu Mbatha-Raw for reshoots to tie the parallel storyline to the main storyline, and no one else. All scenes involving the parallel storyline stick out like a sore thumb. The time spent on those scenes would have been much better used to better explain the logic and rules behind the phenomena. Good horror has rules. The phenomena must operate on some kind of logic that the characters can figure out. All good horror is based on a set of rules that the creature or phenomena operates by, and the story is typically around the characters trying to first figure out those rules, and then subsequently figuring out how to use those rules against the phenomena. The entity in The Thing has a number of rules by which it operates, such as reaction violently to fire. The characters figure this out, and then use it against it. Freddy in Nightmare on Elm Street is powered by the fear he inspires, so if you can overcome that fear you can render him powerless. The alien in Alien is a killing machine, but it isn't technologically advanced. Ellen figures this out, and uses it to eventually kill the alien as it doesn't know which machinery is dangerous. It might be a bit of a trope for horror to follow this trend, but it is a really effective way of setting up a good horror movie. As you learn the rules of the enemy the characters face, you sit and try to figure out ways to use those rules against the enemy, just as the characters are doing. You're invested, and you're thinking along with the protagonists. In poorly written movies, those rules are unclear. When the rules are unclear, you don't really have any clue what a character did wrong that caused them to get killed. Why did Tam (the Chinese astronaut) die? What did she do wrong? Why did Mundy (the Irish astronaut) die? Could he have done anything different? Doesn't really seem like it. Characters in this movie just die because the script decided it's their time to die. Still, a lot of the actors in the movie gave good performances. I especially enjoyed Gugu Mbatha-Raw as the main protagonist, the always stellar Daniel Brühl as the German astronaut, and always funny Chris O'Dowd as Mundy. The visuals were also really good. All in all, a decent movie that would have gotten a 5 if there had been no parallel storyline, but the parallel story puts the final score at 4.",The Cloverfield Paradox

584,alexanderbarbone,Actually kind of nostalgic,4,9 February 2018,"I have to admit, I lost a lot of interest in this movie during the opening credits when I saw that it was produced by J.J. Abrahms. Abrams? I honestly don't remember how to spell his name and looking it up isn't worth my time. But despite my general dislike of his movies, a single bad component won't deter me. So I continued on with this film. Also shame on me for not remember the producer behind the Cloverfield franchise.Shortly after the opening credits, two things become immediately apparent:1. Hamilton (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) will at some point become the person in charge.
2. The plot will follow that of ""Event Horizon"".And sure enough, shortly after starting up their experiment, the Event Horizon, I mean the Shepherd, is transported to a different dimension. Chaos ensues. Naturally. There is a bit of a dramatic twist in that the crew has jumped into a mirror dimension that is very similar to their own. There are some global-scale differences and a few personal differences. Thankfully, only Hamilton is an important character, so we don't waste time with choices on morality for the rest of the crew.Now back to that chaos: instead of anything genuinely scary, it turns out to be a series of either simple explanations (changes in personnel, physical shifts in space), or events that were perhaps meant to be confusing or profound but are instead uninteresting or obviously only necessary to drive the plot. I don't care about how the worms got into the Volkov's (Aksel Hennie) body, their importance wasn't even explained (though regardless I did enjoy the Russian nesting doll motif). Of course the spaceship goes missing because we wouldn't have a story otherwise. The atmosphere plays a crucial factor in subduing the tension as the scenery is more akin to the comparatively upbeat ""Interstellar"" than to either the isolation-inducing ""2001 Space Odyssey"" or the foreboding of ""Aliens"". Though there are times when the unexpected does occur. Like the water scene with Tam (Ziyi Zhang), which also serves to function as the mandatory trapped-in-the-airlock scene. And I'm not talking about the massive volume of water flooding the compartment since I believe that you were supposed to assume that it was coming from the version of the Shepherd native to the dimension in which our characters currently find themselves, since we were shown it had crash-landed in the ocean in a previous scene (but seriously, couldn't you have included some nice touch about the water being salty?). No, I'm talking about how the water suddenly freezes solid when exposed to the vacuum of space. Come on, you hacks, didn't you bother looking up even basic physics experiments before you starting writing this? Or did you just hope that throwing around words like gyro and Higgs-Boson frequently enough would sound sufficiently sciencey?Since the movie had so little hope of success in it's intended genre, it did included some humor. There were times that the mysterious events of this mirror dimension would better be described as shenanigans because they're actually funny. Mundy (Chris O'Dowd), is hand-down the most likable crew member because at least he's got some endearing charm. The second-most likable crew member is of course is severed arm (the finger tapping at the end, classic Mundy). The rest of these people are cardboard cut-outs whose deaths are trivial given that the only thing less vacuous in this movie than the space around the Shepherd is the emotional investment in any character besides Hamilton. Looking at you Captain iMustGoDownWithTheShip (David Oyelowo) and Dr. Sheepish Sherpa (John Ortiz).Anyway, the enigmatic yet uninteresting Jensen (Elizabeth Debicki) tries to kill the last of the crew and is eventually stopped by Hamilton in a stalking sequence that ends just as the writer's were finally developing some tension. But the only surprise in Jensen being sucked into space is of course that she wasn't crushed fitting through a tiny opening as she did so. I mean, the overtures on ""Alien"" were already apparent enough in this scene, why not include an homage at this point?So we're at the end of the movie and it finally occurs to Hamilton that she can save the children she hasn't yet lost in this dimension by placing a phone call before she returns to her home dimension. Schmidt (Daniel Brühl) of course survives to assist in the transdimensional journey since Hamilton ... since Hamilton is the ... wait, what was her role on this mission anyway? Was she the communications expert? Why didn't she think about calling herself in order to save her kids earlier?Oh and there's a half-assed story that takes place on Earth almost entirely in either a car or bunker. Which means the only claustrophobia-inducing moments don't even happen on the goddamn space station. And creepy things are happening. Because monsters. Because it's cloverfield.So 4 out of 10 stars, mostly because Mbatha-Raw really did try and Debicki's performance was delightfully unnerving. I wouldn't given it fewer but parts of this movie did bring me back to moments in some great science fiction films. Which of course begs the question: how can a movie that takes the better parts of classic movies turn out less than sum of its parts? I don't know, but you would think Abrams would've figured out how to avoid that after rewriting Episode IV.",The Cloverfield Paradox
585,clist186,"Could be better, but watch it for what it is.",6,5 February 2018,"I really wanted to love this movie. I am a huge Cloverfield universe fan, but this movie tried to do too many things at once, and ended up doing very little at all.The movie starts off like Danny Boyle's 'Sunshine': A crisis on Earth causes a multicultural team of astronauts to do things on a space station. However, once the main plot kicks off, it turns into a mix of 'Alien' and 'Interstellar', but fails to do both effectively. The worms inside the body was a great premise that was quickly abandoned to shift to random unbelievable disasters happening on other parts of the ship. They find a crew member warped into the wall somehow. Was she hanging out in the wall on the 'parallel' universe ship? How come none of 'our' astronauts got warped over to the 'other' ship?Chris O'Dowd's character somehow gets most of his arm 'eaten' by the ship itself. Literally, his arm warps into the wall as if some kind of force is dragging it. This is also, to my recollection, not in any way explained.We're also expected to believe that a group of highly educated highly trained astronauts with multi-billion dollar space equipment were unable to figure out the fact that their ship was upside-down on the opposite side of the sun, and instead believed Earth to have ""disappeared"" until they found the convenient plot device (the 'gyro') that helped them notice Earth in two seconds.The plot is wrapped up rather predictably, and the people you probably expected to survive, do survive.Now all that being said, it's the Cloverfield scenes that really tie the movie together. Despite the fact that they were clearly shoehorned into the movie at a later stage, it gives a nice break from the space station shenanigans at just the right moments, and gives fans of the Cloverfield series (like myself) what we really came here to see.Bottom line:Fans of Cloverfied will get what they came for. Those watching it for anything other than a part of the Cloverfield universe will be sorely disappointed.

When things start to go wrong, every problem is HUGE, and the crew of the lost ship battle so many BIG disasters, always at impossible odds, that I just couldn't suspend my disbelief. There is no character development, although there is much opportunity for it, as characters from another dimension come into our protagonists' dimension, with a history of events and of personal relationships that our protagonist crew is unaware of. One such new comer has deep and unwarranted trust issues with a crew member, but all we learn is that the trust issue is HUGE, and in that light it remains one dimensional and cartooney. The dialog is rife with cliches: ""Only I can do this;"" ""I HAVE to go out there;"" ""I don't have a choice,"" and so on. The dialog, as with the events, is full of grandstanding gestures that, like the characters, utterly lack subtlety; I've 
heard those lines so many times, I wonder if these B grade script writers all copy from a dialog manual that they share. And there are errors of science that an eighth grader should catch, as when a small tank of non-flammable CO2 somehow, against all the laws of the universe, explodes, and blows out the side of the ship. Mistakes so absurd that in a scifi movie that tries to look and sound like it's full of hard science, are dumbfounding because they would have been so easy to fix. And should have been.",The Cloverfield Paradox
592,zerenitythoughts,Honest review! Good acting bad writing no spoiling,1,11 June 2018,"The ending had to be a joke! Who pitched this and who wrote this! 
First I would like to express that the actors did a fine job. Not enough to save it however because this is writing no actor can save.I won't spoil too much, I promise. the only thing I mention is the beginning. So the earth is out of energy. REALLY!? So apparently this never gets explained that's issue numero uno in the first few minutes.
So we can't use nuclear anymore? Light nor wind energy?
I'm not even that smart and even I could have fixed that as a writer! 
Example: In this universe company greed stopped any means of alternative energy until suddenly we are starving for energy. 
Which is totally wack! But at least it's an explanation!There are sooo many and I do mean a lot of science fiction things that make no sense! And it's just a cheap way of ""looking smart when your actual not a smart writer"" 
think ""lost"" when you watch this... they keep complicating things and have zero explanations. I'm just saying, and this didn't happen in the movie, but you can't just have a donkey come out of the walls shooting lasers...I feel bad for the actors 
And again that ending lol omg I would have laughed so hard had I not been sooo disappointed. It leads you down an interesting path then totally disappoints you.",The Cloverfield Paradox

The best of Cloverfield is that we are watching many things that they don't explain but it makes those movies better because it's up to us to think about it and try to find a proper explanation, cleverness it's not for everyone apparently, specially for those review writers on ""The Guardian"" or ""Forbes"".This movie is not for everyone's taste, for sure, but it's way better than a lot of movies out there.

(2) Why does the Chinese lady speak only Chinese, while everyone else speaks only English? Yet they all understand each other perfectly. Babelfish?

605,Ayman_98,"Everyone complaining that this movie is a ""dumb marketing scheme"", are all wrong!!!",8,16 February 2018,"Im going to try keep this brief (which is sort of impossible as there is so much to explain). Lets get something straight, was this a ""superb"" movie, no. Was this a movie where you could walk away saying it pushed sci-fi boundaries like interstellar, no. Was this movie which plays a huge rule in the Cloverfield universe, **** yeah!Here is the simplest way of saying this, The Cloverfield Paradox is a paradox, and it all revolves around a timeline. Everything I explain has been uncovered by reddit users who are playing the Augmented Reality Game (ARG) that J.J Abrams has conjured up in the year 2007 to help create a solid story. The original Cloverfield movie was released in 2008, and is believed to be based in the same year. It is the same with the 2nd instalment, 10 Cloverfield Lane (released in 2016 and based in 2016). However, there is a drastic change with the latest film which completely flips the timeline. The Cloverfield Paradox takes place in the year 2028, when the Shepard is launched into space. In the beginning of the film we see the crew work on their quest to find a source of unlimited energy to save earth. Take into account that this is 10 years from our present day (2018). Each film takes place on the same timeline but in different universes. This probably doesn't make any sense now but will soon. We are told that the world is out of oil due to mass overconsumption of energy by humans, which is why they are searching for an energy source. People complain that the writers forgot about solar, geothermal, wind, and hydro-electric solutions, but obviously these sources would not be able to sustain the population as energy worldwide is depleting (It's the future guys there could be so many things that happened during these 10 years thats forcing humans to take such drastic measures). 2 years go by and every time the crew had tried to obtain the energy they failed. It's now the year 2030 and the crew eventually are able to find some sort of energy, but only briefly as the Shepard explodes. This is what essentially creates the paradox and creates everything clover related. What happened when they continued to rip through space to find energy is that they completely broke the timeline and had brought sea creatures (Cloverfield, Cloverfield Paradox), Aliens (10 Cloverfield lane) and demons (Overlord - said to be the next instalment in the franchise). All of these monsters/creatures were mentioned by Mark Stambler, the bearded guy in the interview that was shown at the beginning of the film, who foreshadowed and explained everything that happened and that will happen in the franchise. Mark Stambler is also somehow related to Howard Stambler the main antagonist of 10 Cloverfield Lane. We don't know how the Shepard did this, all we know is that it happened because of the Shepard. The Shepard did not cause the monsters to attack Earth, it only brought them to existence. 
So currently the timeline is in chronological order, but they are not being connected with the same universe. All the films take place in different universes but on the same timeline. You could say that the Shepard explosion had brought the Clover (the monster shown in the movies) eggs into existence thousands of years ago. It is also why there are aliens in the universe that 10 Cloverfied Lane takes place. The Shepard didn't send the aliens to attack Earth, but because of the Shepard aliens exist and they had then found earth and decided to attack.On top of this there is everything that happened in the movie and the two different dimensions. So what I am trying to say is that this film plays a major role in the Cloverfield franchise as it creates a sort of backstory to the first two films even though it is the 3rd instalment in the franchise. Now, there is a lot more involved in the Cloverfield franchises, that is very interesting, and it all revolves around a deep-sea oil drilling company who are gradually and unintentionally causing the end of the human race because of their greed. The Japanese company is sort of like the Dharma Initiative (the company in the TV show ""LOST"", also created by Abrams). YES I KNOW!!! It is all very confusing, but if you want to know more and understand what the Cloverfield franchise is really about watch a YouTube video that covers all Cloverfield theories created by YouTuber: 'Inside A Mind'. I promise you will be hooked.Overall, I gave this film an 8/10. I would have preferred to give it a 10/10, but I have to be honest there are some parts of the story (which are unrelated to the whole timeline of the franchise) that really don't make much sense. I genuinely enjoyed watching it and was intrigued during the entire movie and I have to say J.J Abrams has really created one of the greatest franchise stories ever made.P.S. Sorry about this review being confusing, its much easier to understand if you just watch the video. Also this is not a promotion for the video, I just found it very helpful.",The Cloverfield Paradox

616,thatCoolBD,"Stellar Cast, Poor Writing",3,6 February 2018,"Oh boy, where am I to begin...So The Cloverfield Paradox is an addition to the beloved Cloverfield franchise. The new installment comes to us fresh off of the overwhelming praise of 10 Cloverfield Lane, a movie that was my second favorite in 2016, the year it came out. Netflix surprised the world with its sudden announcement that the new Cloverfield movie was going to be available when the Super Bowl had concluded. With no previous marketing, and with no previous screenings for movie critics to get early reviews out for viewers to read before viewing the film, Netflix took an undoubtedly unorthodox approach to marketing and distributing the film. Unfortunately, Netflix seems to have taken this approach not for the sake of being unique, but for the sake of shielding the quality of the finished product from the public.I will begin with the very few praises that I have for this film. First of all, the performances are great. Although none are awards-worthy, there is not a single person who phones it in. Secondly, the visual effects are very believable. Aside for a segment that includes a space walk, the VFX are exceptional and are nothing to scoff at.Now, onto the negatives. There are so many issues with this film and its writing that I am bound to fail in pointing out all of them in this review: 1. Astronauts are smart people. The amount of training that is required to become an astronaut leaves out any possibility that there will be a less than intelligent person flying into space. There is not a single smart person in this film aboard the space station which helms the coveted particle accelerator, which is the energy source that is supposed to relieve the earth of its energy crises. In fact, each of the space workers make stupid decisions and never talk to each other in a regular human manner, which only brings about more problems. 2. The script is one of the blandest I have ever come across. impossible things begin to happen during the movie, and the movie's reason for allowing these mystical events to happen is that dimensions are intertwined with each other which has an effect on the physics of the dimension that they are in...which is code for ""There is no conceivable way to make this happen, so these impossible things happen due to a mixup in dimensions."" Which leads me to my next point of criticism... 3. Dimensions aren't universes. It's hard to explain what a dimension is, but just imagine the difference between 2D and 3D: 2D has length and width, and 3D has length, width, and depth. While the fourth dimension has length, width, depth, and time. You get the point. My point is, educated astronauts and astrophysicists are getting the terms ""universes"" and ""dimensions"" mixed up, which is annoying when you actually know which one is which. 4. There is a subplot having to do with the husband of Gugu Mbatha-Raw's character which goes no where. He ends up saving an abandoned girl at a demolished hospital, and the sequence of events dealing with them that occur after this has absolutely no effect on the rest of the movie. 5. The scarce marketing for the movie promised that we would find out exactly why the events of the first Cloverfield happened. After watching this train wreck of a film, I can confidently say that there are no explanations to explain the happenings of Cloverfield or 10 Cloverfield Lane. There is, however, an attempt to say that the particle accelerator aboard the space station was responsible for the events of the first movie, but again, there are no explanations as to how this happened...expect for there being ""multiple dimensions that have collided"" or something along those mystically absurd lines. 6. There is a character sacrifice that is possibly the most avoidable sacrifice made since I Am Legend. In fact, another character even points out that the sacrifice could be easily avoided, but that doesn't stop one of our stupid astronaut heroes from making yet another dumb decision. However, the whole sacrifice scene is very sad; sad in the sense that the character could have been developed more and actually make us feel sympathy for the space comrade. 7. There are absolutely no connections to the other Cloverfield movies - at least none that make sense. Although this may not be cause for criticism, when taking into account the fact that this film was supposed to explain the events of the first film then it is confusing as to why there were no important connections. Although 10 Cloverfield Lane has very little connections to Cloverfield, I have roughly theorized that maybe being given a title of ""Cloverfield"" expresses the themes of the movie, and not the franchise which the movies are in. The Cloverfield Paradox aims to link the films of the franchise, while forgetting to have the sense of individuality that its predecessors have shown. 8. The villain of the film is more undeveloped than No Man's Sky. There is a strong motivation for the villain to do what they do, but we are given very little information about them and very little reason to care whether the villain or our stupid astronaut protagonists win. 9. There is no sense of direction or position being conveyed to the viewer. Often times the crew members will be rushing to give aid to another member of the crew who is in a different section of the space station, but it is impossible to tell where anyone is in relation to each other. This makes the movie fairly repetitive due to the fact that crew members get into trouble quite a bit throughout the film. 10. To my understanding, the space station is...you know...in space. However, there is a sequence where three of our completely inept astronauts are performing a space walk...while experiencing earth-like gravity...it must be because of the dimensions colliding which also has the power to cause this movie to be bad. 11. The particle accelerator has a personality of its own since one moment it can merge dimensions, but in another moment it can work according to plan and supply energy for the crew members...it must be because of the colliding dimensions that also cause this movie to be more sluggish than a sedated pet turtle.There are more issues with the movie, but exposing them would involve spoilers. Even in a dull movie like The Cloverfield Paradox, you may find some surprises while watching it. This film is just a perfect example of a studio making a bad movie and selling it on the name of an established franchise. I do believe that Netflix has opened up a Pandora's box in regards to releasing bad movies. Why spend money to make a trailer and fund a marketing campaign when you can pull your bad movie out of the shadows and generate hype out of nowhere? Save yourself from this frustrating experience, and do yourself a favor and rewatch the previous two installments instead, which are better in every way. Or don't, I really don't care. I'll just blame the dimensions colliding for your lack of judgement.",The Cloverfield Paradox

624,chaseindiana,A Poor Man's Sunshine / Event Horizon Hybrid,3,5 February 2018,"At least it was cool that Netflix realized it on the day it was announced...This film clearly feels like it was slapped together after the unexpected success of 10 Cloverfield Lane (which wasn't even a ""Cloverfield"" movie to begin with, just a simple suspense thriller that had re-shoots so it could fit in with Cloverfield and hopefully start a franchise I guess. You're a smart man JJ because it worked.) Gone is all the subtlety and mystery that made the last two films so compelling, replaced with scenes that exist solely to pile on the exposition (I'm taking to you, talk radio guy who gives some of the most blatant foreshadowing that I've ever seen). The characters (excluding Hamilton) seem to exist only to tell the audience exactly what is going on at any particular time. They don't even seem very shocked or concerned at the situation they find themselves in, and it is especially hard to take any of them seriously as scientists as they make some very dumb decisions that people in their position shouldn't make (yea it's totally cool to let one of our crew abandon us and go to an alternative Earth where she would have to compete with the other version of herself to see her kids anyway, did she really think this through?). Am I really supposed to think that Kiel would believe Schmidt when he said he wasn't a spy after he already confronted him for it earlier? ""Yea it was definitely the alternate version of myself that sent those messages, I'd never do that."" Even if this ended up being true, Kiel should have no reason to trust anything that he says and should've kept him locked in the airlock if he felt so strongly about the situation.Hamilton's arc is one of the only parts of the movie that shines, but that doesn't mean she's a very interesting or compelling protagonist. The problems start with the very first scene in the film, which is just a very basic shot reverse shot of her and her husband talking in a car. Key word: talking. The show don't tell rule is not present here. The most baffling thing though is that we get a much better version of this scene right after this with her communicating with her husband while she is on the ship. Her sitting by the window with her hand on the video is a great and much more effective way to establish what is going on with her character. This makes it confusing as to why the first scene even exists at all. They cover pretty much all the same information, except they are in different places and at different times. It just feels sloppy and unfocused.Even though Hamilton's dilemma in the film can be interesting at times (even if it doesn't fully make sense), it doesn't make her likeable. All she does throughout the movie is pout about whatever bad thing is going on, without any real range of emotion. Makes it kind of hard to take her seriously as a real person.The scenes that take place on Earth seem to serve no purpose for the story and exist only to tie in the film with the first Cloverfield movie. It's extremely distracting and unessesary for the story that this film is trying to tell. Which takes us to the ending, which is laughable. The idea of ending one of these movie with a Twilight Zone type downer ending is alright and even great if it is done right, but this is no such case. The last 10 seconds of this movie are embarrassing, and just seems like pointless fans service for people who like the design of the Cloverfield monster (which isn't a bad design by any means, just not relevant to the events of this particular film). It's as if the studio was like, ""hey, we know some of you were disappointed that the last movie didn't have the monster in it (even though a sci-fi/horror anthology series with a few slight tie ins would be pretty cool), we put in in this one don't you worry.""It's disappointing more than anything, especially after the surprise critical and financial hit that the last film turned out to be. As far as direction goes there isn't too much to say, not bad but not great either. The film goes for a mostly handheld kind of look which works sometimes, but at others the camera just goes into full shaky cam mode when it doesn't at all seem necessary. The same can be said for acting. There is no John Goodman equivalent performance which makes it a lot less interesting and engaging as a result (not to compare this movie too much to the last one and say that it needs a John Goodman type character, but it would've been nice to see a standout performance that helped drive the film along). Overall, it was just a very disappointing film. I'll still hold out hope for the next installment, but after this I'll be a little more weary.3/10",The Cloverfield Paradox

626,ryanbarich,Connections,7,6 February 2018,"Now this movie is getting bashed a ton,but that's because you're not looking at it for what it really is, an explanation to the cloverfield monster and those aliens we see at the end of 10 Cloverfield Lane. The way I see this movie,and how I hope Bad Robot meant this movie to be, is the connecting element that brings these cloverfield movies together and in that case I think it does that beautifully. It goes into detail introducing and explaining the science of the franchise which if you're a true movie nerd you'd know has to do with the multiverse theory. Basically when the Shepard activated the particle collider and travel to that parallel dimension, the theory is that because of this extradimensional beings (the monsters and the aliens) are torn from their universe and then put into the dimensions where clover field and 10 cloverfield Lane take place. 
I loved the science it was so interesting to me, but the performances by Chris O'dowd And Elizabeth Debicki just came off as really monotone, especially when it came to their deaths which is not how you want a death scene portrayed. There were also a couple of plot holes you can definitely find like how Kiel didn't have to sacrifice himself because Hamilton states ""we can just do this remotely"".
All in all I loved the idea of this movie bringing everything togther I thought it did an amazing job introducing that and explaining it, but it just was victim to some shotty acting and some mediocre story telling down the stretch.",The Cloverfield Paradox

632,markbranigan44,Well that was a a mess...,2,6 February 2018,"I loved Cloverfield and I really enjoyed 10 Cloverfield Lane so I did rush to stream this. I really don't know why I bothered.
Trying to avoid too many spoilers here, but the setting is hackneyed - No more energy, do some science in space yada yada... Old stuff which can be done quite well so in itself not a dealbreaker.
However, the characters are genuine, bona-fide idiots. Not one of them maintains any semblance of professionalism, and the dialogue the actors are forced to spout is just ridiculous, with all of them plotting and scheming against each other for frankly no good reason. 
Something in space goes wrong, suddenly there's no sign of Earth, so obviously that means Earth is gone, it never occurs to any character that it might be they themselves that have moved (even though moving a space station is probably much easier than obliterating a whole planet). 
A main character suddenly reveals that their family all died, out of nowhere, and later on another character who wasn't involved in that discussion uses this info against said character. Presumably they're psychic. 
On Earth, a TV Talking-head Exposition Dude explains the insanely specific detail that if the space mission is successful, huge monsters will appear in the past. How in the world he knows this is anyone's guess. 
The space station will be destroyed utterly if the bottom bit of it gets twisted to 25 degrees, but thankfully it only gets twisted to 24.9 degrees so that's OK, peril averted.
Honestly, it's like one big plot hole tied together with bad scripts, and that's before we get to any of the tacked-on non-sequiters to connect it to either previous Cloverfield film. It's as bad as Prometheus in and of itself, but then tries to shoehorn itself into a genuinely unrelated film series as if somebody suddenly decided that Prometheus was the catalyst for the events of Star Wars.
I'm sorry my review isn't terribly coherent, but I'm still trying to find any sense in what I just forced myself to watch. 
In short, not a good space-peril movie, and really nothing whatsoever to do with the rest of the franchise. Sticking the monster on the end so that you can pretend it's a Cloverfield story is like putting Lego Batman in Texas Chainsaw Massacre so you can pretend it's a superhero movie.

Most negative reviews are negative because the reviewers feel misled. The movie in itself is enjoyable to watch providing you ignore some ""small"" error's/impossible things.
An arm get's cut off, yet without any blood. The crewmember doesn't even feel any pain. The arm later appears, has a life (and mind) of it's own, even gives a clue about the whereabouts of the gyroscope. Now how did the arm know that it was in the stomache of a crewmember, how did it get there and how did the crewmember survive this? And how could such a precision instrument work without any problems after being extracted from the stomach? What/why/how about the mysterious water accident of engineer Tam? Repairpaste which develops the lust to strangle it's user? It would take me to long to mention all the strange, unexplainable events, so i'll stop here.I had high hopes for this movie due to the title, i was hoping for something comparable to Cloverfield.

639,rubystrings,Very standard Sci-Fi movie with forced Cloverfield references.,4,5 February 2018,"What begins as a fairly interesting sci-fi with apparent links to Cloverfield through a couple of forced but sensible name drops turns into a very predictable and dull ""space station escape"" type film, complete with completely pointless dramatic sacrifices, inexplicable spatial anomalies(That are, for the most part, without any explanation or narrative relevance), and weakly motivated betrayals. All of this makes the movie painfully average, but perhaps the worst thing about this whole experience is the unbelievably forced and pointless insert of the original Cloverfield monster at the very last second. I'm generally pretty accepting of ""fan service,"" but here, it's unbearable, and makes me think that this was just a fairly standard Netflix sci-fi that was somehow able to tack the Cloverfield branding onto its title in the last month of production.While it does do more to attach itself to Cloverfield than 10 Cloverfield Lane, it doesn't have any of the solid writing or great performances that that film did.Some cool visuals, not fantastic but solid performances all around, and an interesting near-apocalyptic tone in the Earthbound scenes elevate The Cloverfield Paradox above terrible, but ultimately aren't enough to sway its many, many flaws.",The Cloverfield Paradox

Wasn't too hard to follow considering the title has ""paradox,"" and it was also explained in the first act during the news interview, then several more times throughout the film. With that said, it was a different approach to the same space survival movie. It did enough to keep me engaged, more because I'm interested in the expansion of the Cloverfield universe, but it failed to deliver any surprises outside of jump scares. Only Mbatha's character was fleshed out, and mildly at that. Overall, still enjoyable if you're a fan of the series. As to where it fits in the Cloverfield series? I'd have to go back and watch the original because this feels more like a prequel than a sequel. Seems like this movie caused the events of the first Cloverfield. Or perhaps the first act caused the events of the first movie, while the rest takes place simultaneously or afterwards.",The Cloverfield Paradox
641,koolstr,Another Divisive Yet Truly Special Cloverfield Film,9,5 February 2018,"For diehard Cloverfield fans like me, who have done extensive research, followed all the online meta-games released alongside the films, and tried to piece everything in the Cloverfield universe together, this is a much-needed and welcome entry into the anthology that helps to clarify and explain many of the things we were only able to speculate on with the previous films. However, it produces just as many new puzzle pieces and questions as it offered solutions. Like the others, I will very much so enjoy the discussions and theorizing which will occur, in an attempt to frame it all together. There are tons of tiny, subtle references made here that span across all the films, offering a sense of consistency and continuity, helping to more accurately align things in the Cloverfield timeline and chain of cause and effect. There is clearly a deliberate, master plan and overarching storyline, and we're being served bits of it through a continuing series of films (and online easter eggs).As a standalone film, outside of the context and depth of the lore of the Cloverfield universe, I can see people taking this in as a pretty generic, and possibly even mediocre, space horror survival film. People in this film act without forethought and as stupidly as any victim in any other horror survival film. The overarching plot, the way events play out, the way characters die, and the filming style completely keep to established and well-worn horror tropes. It was so easy to predict the order in which they would die, when, and how. The horror and horrific events are somewhat weak. In terms of the way the plot plays out, it is very predictable and standard. There are clear references or parallels to other sci-fi space survival horror films, like Alien and Life, which can either be seen as homages meant to set proper moods, or as cheap and un-creative. The acting is solid, but there is a ton of exposition, often awkwardly blatant. Like each Cloverfield film, there is no happy ending, nor a satisfying one. Just an open-ended conclusion that leaves you to think about it all yourself, and that seems to be driving towards some final act that will finally tie it all together perfectly. Nonetheless, this film manages to be a unique, independent story from - and just like - the other Cloverfield films. Its proposed paradoxes are If you are an engineer, a scientist, or somebody who can appreciate and understand all the theoretical science references, such as quantum entanglement and the Higgs Boson (which frankly are bordering on established science at this point), then you would be able to appreciate and understand this film to a much higher degree than the average person. These scientific theories do exist already, and everything that happens is plausible, and has a corresponding scientific basis & explanation. Most people don't know these, and hence all these things come across as random, unexplained BS pulled out of thin air to them, especially since the film does not go through the effort to try to explain these concepts to the viewer. These unaware people are thus missing all the true depth the film is offering. It is meant for intelligent digestion, in a stylistic mix of Interstellar, Black Mirror, Alien, Gravity, Prometheus (which was a much-worse sci-fi survival horror film), Life, and, well, Cloverfield. It isn't about the plot or the characters; they are a driving mechanism for all the other contributing aspects of the film (i.e., its lore, its scientific explanations, and its world-building).I've always enjoyed the super-mysterious nature of the series, and how the announcement of this film was made moments before its actual release, during the Superbowl. That's a quicker turnaround than even the reveal of 10 Cloverfield Lane had. It was a very pleasant surprise that made me giddy; I went to watch the full film straight afterwards. Upon completion, I left it not confused like others, but further intrigued and thought-provoked.Essentially, this film is meant to be appreciated by diehards and science geeks. All the subtle references and lore that explains how the movies are connected, along with the plausible theoretical science used to justify it all, offers a compelling, thoughtful, exciting film. If you are not that kind of person though, then this will simply come across as a shallow, generic, by-the-numbers space sci-fi horror flick.",The Cloverfield Paradox

644,vagabondexe,A wasted opportunity. What they needed to do...,3,5 February 2018,"To start with the obvious - the movie completely departed from what made its predecessor popular: uncertain complications, questionable characters and Lovecraftian horror. This was tremendously disappointing given such a promising premise.If I could have had my way... 1) I'd draw out the tension in the opening scenes of the film when they are test-firing the Shepherd. They somehow managed to make firing one of the most amazing pieces of technology almost boring. We needed a build-up of tension, nervous radio chatter from Earth, the whirring of the collider, big vibrations: a dreadful sense of foreboding. 2) The characters needed more development before the disaster. Set it up as a ""Who did it"" - with vague and misleading actions which would have intensified the aftermath after the disaster, play into Schmidt's existing arc and add extra weight to Mina's arrival and the accusation she made. E.g. Schmidt could have been seen responding to an email saying ""I'll let you know when its done""... Tam could have been seen overriding a control. Volkov was already playing into this through his erratic behavior. 3) The comic relief was an absolute misfire. I was so disappointed when I realised they had typecast Chris O'Dowd and reduced him to a caricature. These cheap gags broke up the atmosphere, which was already tenuous at best, making the middle part of the film feel more like a Star Trek rip-off.4) Cut out bloated plot devices. The whole segment with the arm and the gyro was a waste of time and really marked the turning point of the film into slapstick B-grade sci-fi. The film's latter half only continued in the wrong direction - concentrating on physical obstacles which ultimately felt like a derivative of Gravity, instead of the insurmountable cosmic horror that the previous Cloverfield films thrived on.5) An especially wasted opportunity in the finale. Mina's betrayal was underwhelming as her motivation was obvious - she wanted to bring the technology back to her own Earth. She was from another dimension - seriously - this was the most simplistic motive that the writers could have come up with. Imagine if there hadn't been any escape pods - and if her real motive was that she didn't want to go back to their dimension was because she knew or suspected the aliens? That would have gotten us somewhere...",The Cloverfield Paradox

650,burningmace,I can see why it went straight to Netflix,2,5 February 2018,"Where do I start with this one? Oh how the mighty have fallen.I went into this with some reservations, primarily wondering why a previously-blockbuster franchise would end up releasing its third act directly on Netflix. Don't get me wrong - I love Netflix, and I think it's great when film studios try to get away from the old models and move towards digital distribution - but the cynic in me wonders whether this was a forced hand, rather than a choice made of their own volition.First I'll sing its praises where praise is due. The visual effects in the opening scenes showing the space station are impressive. I liked the concept of the multiple habitation areas rotating around the central mast to produce a gravity effect - not very well grounded in physics, but it looks cool. The music was also pretty solid. Unfortunately that's where I run out of positives.Not a single character in this movie is believable; most of them are clichés bordering on parody. There's a Ripley-from-Alien type in the leading role, her traditionally good-looking partner back on Earth (who happens to be a doctor, and only speaks in slow profound statements), an angry paranoid Russian dude with blonde hair, a nerdy experimental physicist with glasses (did I mention he's German and doesn't like the Russian guy?), a serious-looking Chinese woman who only speaks Chinese so you're definitely sure she's Chinese, a bald religious medic called Monk who (for whatever reason) can't perform autopsies, a blue-collar Irishman as the comic relief, a mysterious androgynous woman with questionable motives, a cookie-cutter male-leader-type so archetypal and forgettable that I almost forgot to add him in this list, a cameo from Alex Jones (I'm pretty sure it's him... he was trying to sell a book), and finally a little blonde white girl in peril who offers literally nothing to the plot other than to deliver a PSA about not texting while driving (no I am not kidding).The whole film seems to be trying to survive solely on nods and homages to sci-fi classics, but most of them are so egregiously ham-fisted that they venture into full-blown parody. They rip off the John Hurt chestburster scene from Alien almost identically, even down to the gender and role of each character in the room, except it ends in a completely nonsensical way and is followed immediately by a joke, as if they thought the whole thing was a bit of comic relief. The crew are put through a series of unexplained and horrifying events, yet they all seem fairly unfazed in a rather ""yes that was very weird now let's do the dishes"" kind of way. The dialogue is clunky, characters' motivations and behaviours aren't very convincing, it's full of plot holes, the sci- bit of the sci-fi is fairly lackluster, and overall I'd expect to see something like this in the horror B-movie discount bin rather than as part of a Hollywood blockbuster franchise.The one solace I took from it is that it finally ended one of the many arguments about the events of the original Cloverfield, but I'll not spoil that one for you. It's almost worth watching just to get that answer, but it's a steep price to pay.",The Cloverfield Paradox

I'd say I was somewhere in the middle of those two reactions. The premise of the movie is quite like a lot of the space-station-featured movies we see where the station blows up or something and the crew has to survive. It definitely takes cue from Gravity for a strong, smart, bad-ass female that takes the lead in a disastrous situation, Alien for, aliens onboard (were there actual aliens besides Jensen??) and killing off the crew one by one. LOL. I laughed a lot during this movie but I felt like the ""thriller"" part was more at the beginning and then tapered off. Interesting plot twists but I saw them coming. Loved the diverse cast and crew. I thought it was really cool that the whole team speaks fluent Mandarin in the movie. That's not something I've seen before among a space crew, which was really cool. Would I watch it again? Ummmm probably not. After I finished watching the movie, there's just a few things I'm curious about: 1. How did Jensen actually get on the ship and into a wall? 2. Did they actually clean up the worms that flew out of Volstok? 3. It would have made a much more interesting story had they actually destroyed the earth and been forced to go to the one in the other dimension. Like, if you had to trust Jensen and help her save her planet and yet potentially live in the same dimension as yourself? 4. Where'd the monster come from? How'd it get there? Is it Godzilla's cousin? 5. Tam should have stayed alive to revel in the fact that she's literally the smartest person onboard. They should rename it the Tam Accelerator. I realize that I gave it a high rating, although my review may point out more problematic things, well....I didn't hate the movie.

662,stanca_silviu,so sick and tired,3,7 February 2018,"This is not your pompous, sophisticated typical review. this is a scream for normality.we;re afraid to speak, to watch, to think. fear is driving movie industry to madness. you're not politically correct, you're insane. stop pushing women stereotypes, gender ambiguity, racial inadvertence. so, brace yourself: women fighting, dominating, abusing men is not empowering, affluence of Asians and Blacks just to reach masses is degrading for the people you try to represent. stop flooding our retina with idiotic chick fights, black crew, evil Russians, and this new age agenda of emasculating men, forcing them to be perpetually apologetic. lieutenant Ripley would burn these cliche brain damaging movies. allow women to be wives, moms, and men to stand tall, to provide for their families,, let kids to be girls and boys, not neutral gender caricatures, and seize this siege on cinematography, make good movies, not political race/gender garbage",The Cloverfield Paradox
663,ryanmcqueen-96936,excellent story to tie in the others,10,8 February 2018,"Start off by saying this movie was a great movie, the story was there and plenty of scenes to make you actually wonder how its going to play out. i didn't know what was going to happen, so props to them. 
 
yes the explanation is not given 100% for how everything ties togther, they leave some hints and leave it for us to put together and that is why i love this movie it makes the audience engage with the movie they feel apart of it, other movies just spew out the whole story in seconds then it spoils the rest of the movie or movies.
We dont want it yet, carry it out into the next movies, we want more from this movie universe. drop the story into little parts of every movie then for the end bring it all home and shock us ! loved the space station idea and the multi verse smashing theory, its a smart concept for a movie and sadly i think some just dont want that as the storyline or cant grasp it which sucks cause this movie will get heat for that, but that dosnt make it a bad movie, its exceptional storytelling for what the story needed to tie them together without diluting the source material that got the audience hooked. seeing that monster destroy new york it wasnt some ridiculous monster, it was something that looked liked it was real and a part of evolution granted on another scale but as a viewer i could actually picture that monster destroying my city. Then this movie comes with its energy crisis and a super collider in space to generate power but still bring in the actual science of the dangers of what this has on our world and then they smash a hole in the fabric of space and time. unleashing monsters and supernatural forces. this is something that could actually happen in the real world that what this movie is telling is showing us 'WHAT IF"" and thats why this movie is a 10/10 for me and i cant wait to see the next chapter of the cloververse.",The Cloverfield Paradox
664,reubencode,This is not a bad movie,7,8 February 2018,"Here is something to look to, if your an avid Sci-Fi entertainment watcher, you might see this movie as predictable. If not, this movie will give you an interesting ride. As far as acting goes, all the characters are believable in their situations. When I first saw the reviews of this movie I thought it was going to be a mess kinda like the way Suicide Squad was a mess, but it's not. It has a consistent storyline and the viewer will not get lost. It is a great movie, no. Is it an entertaining movie, yes. If you have netflix and interested in this movie, give it a try.",The Cloverfield Paradox
665,hatecrewslayer,Event Horizon Part II,5,8 February 2018,"The Event Horizon part II wasn't that bad. I'm just not sure if it was a prequel or a squeal. Same concept as the original, a spaceship bridges the crew between dimensions, scary and weird stuff happens, and most of the crew gets killed. Morpheus isn't in this one though, but there is another token black guy, but he's not as good. Godzilla even made a cameo appearance at the end of the movie. Looks like he put on a lot of weight though. Overall movie is not quite as bad as people make it out to be. Also how does a guy die instantly from a gun shot to the stomach, and another guy gets shot in the shoulder and stomach and live? Is that the Cloverfield paradox?",The Cloverfield Paradox
666,johngelhardwi,Inane,1,9 February 2018,"I was hoping this movie would pick up where 10 Cloverfield Lane left off. It doesn't. Instead, you have something like the movie Outland crossed with Interstellar. It's stupid, inane, weird, and not worth watching. If your entertainment time is limited, don't waste your time with this one. It's awful. You quickly realize why this movie never went to the big screen. Netflix will be asking for their money back on this one.",The Cloverfield Paradox

I can only surmise that it significantly helps if you already know background info of plot elements. In this case, quantum physics--especially quantum entanglement--and actual secret government projects, like the Montauk Project and Philadelphia Experiment. I thought the cast was great, and it didn't take itself too seriously, which I enjoyed. Practically spoofed the franchise simultaneously, you know, like elements from different dimensions forced to share the same space with scifi horror... pretty damn great, and risky. Like using a massive atom smasher.",The Cloverfield Paradox
668,lsncgamer,Perfect for the Franchise,10,9 February 2018,"As we take a look back on all of the previous cloverfield movies it is clear to see they aren't a series to watch in random order or without looking into the hidden details of the movie set. Each movie has been chaotic and with little backstory information, together they make an amazing story that can be tied together. The thrill of this movie set is not knowing what to expect and how easily adaptable the storyline is. I for one eagerly look forward to the next movie and am very impressed at the detail and creativity expressed in the film.",The Cloverfield Paradox

Therefore, I can only rate the film as a standalone. I found it exciting, scary and sometimes funny, so I would have liked to give it a better rating if it were not for the last 10 seconds of the movie that somehow destroyed the whole concept.

672,coffeetradingni,This is for quantum mechanics enthusiasts,10,13 February 2018,"This is for quantum mechanics enthusiasts.
The Cloverfield Paradox has too much sense in how to explain a quark impulse, the relativity among different dimensions and how the brain is capable to remember lineally exactly as the time works, like a movie, straight forword towards the next period.
It ends exactly as I expected eaten by a huge dino because it was impossible to return to the original Earth, that Earth seen a space station to explode and in the far future (after a quark impulse) the ""same"" Space Station (the same object in two different places at the same time OR at the same time in two different spaces) were able to solve the energy problem and therefore if pretend to return to the Planet Earth it will return to something different, not in the past, but a different evolved type of life and matter.",The Cloverfield Paradox
673,steffacebook,this movie explains it all,8,13 February 2018,"Why do people complain this wouldnt fit in the cloverfield universe? 
it fits perfectly. the shepard works with the multiverse theory and that explains it all. 
any decision you ever made, will lead to an extra universe with different choice and of course there are thousands of universes where things went different and humankind even dont existed because their progenitors made different decisions.
so of course there are a lot of universes with an earth with total different inhabitants. (the ""monsters"" from movie one and the ""aliens"" from movie two)
due to the shepard several universes crashed together and many things are drawing together resulting in the strange things happening at the space station. (and on earth as you can see in the other 2 movies)
its impossible for a human to foreknow all possibilities happening in different universes so they just refer to it as chaos because of the human disability to understand it. 
but of course its not chaos, if you could see all the other universes and their parameters, everything would make totally sense, but they dont show you that on the movie.
so people are confused. and rate this a bad movie. but its not.
i would like to explain everything a little bit more detailed but im not a native english speaker, sorry.",The Cloverfield Paradox
674,domenic-38798,A lot of nonsense and stupidity,2,16 February 2018,"I was blown away by stupidity and fake drama of the spacecraft crew. These people should be professionals, yet they act like emotional teenagers making stupid emotional decisions and it's sad to watch.Acting is OKish, not great, but seen worse. Plot is beyond stupid. Consider the following: People are running out of energy and they have built a giant and expensive space station to apparently harvest some kind of energy to save the plantet. Apparently no one knows that you can install solar panels, use wind/water energy reactors. Apparently no one heard of electric cars either. I mean they have 5 years to switch to renewable energy which is perfectly doable considering we use 25% of renewable energy in 2018. This is beyond stupid and makes you wonder how this plot was ever approved.The plot just becomes more idiotic with every new scene. There are many factual errors such as incorrect representation of gravity etc. Overall it feels like the whole spaceship/station was built by morons. Oh and yes, everyone speaks Chinese, because well, no idea!My favourite moment is when Ava shoots the glass window with a gun and actually penetrates it....ON A SPACESHIP. SHE SHOOTS AND PENETRATES A GLASS WINDOW AND A SPACESHIP?! Yeh, it's that stupid.",The Cloverfield Paradox

It's on par with the second one. The second one was a movie of it's own as far as the underground bunker and a creepy John Goodman.
This one had it's creepy moments. Some parts reminded me on Aliens or Life. I liked the space base plot of it.All three are very different in their plots and environments.I've definitely watched worse Netflix movies.",The Cloverfield Paradox

At this point, I was wondering if I am watching ""Evil Dead"". No comprehensible connection of why the arm fell of and why the arm has a mind of its own. This is basically how the entire plot is done. Is this supposed to be a horror? Or some kind of a bad joke? I really had hard time grasping what the director's intention was. Maybe I would understand better if watched the TV series.

679,jacobmerrychambers,Loved it,10,11 August 2018,"I really love the Cloverfield franchise and I had to wait 4 months after this film was released to watch it as I don't have Netflix but when I was at a relatives house I got to watch it and even though it had been spoiled for me I really enjoyed it . Was some of it confusing ? Yes but nothing in the Cloververse is ever laid out for us is it ?
This film answers some burning questions such as why was their a giant Monster in the ocean in the first place for Tagruato to discover ? Because it was sent there due to the space station messing up time in this films dimension. Where did the aliens come from in 10 Cloverfield Lane ? They're ere transported there due to the space station messing up time . This film also had some awesome Easter eggs such as the logos for Tagruato and some of its subsidiaries being seen on the space station but this film had one Easter egg which I absolutely love in 10 Cloverfield Lane Emmit says he saw a red flash in the sky in this film the Space station emits (no pun intended) a red flash . Something else which is just pure speculation on my part but we see parts of the station fall off in this film which could mean that it's part of the space station we see fall into the water in the first film and the final thing is that the monster in the first film is described as a baby it would seem that the monster in this film is the mother !!!Do I recommend this movie ? If you love the othe Cloverfield movies then absolutely if you've not seen them then go watch them and look into the ARG (basically the backstory to certain things which you can find online ) and then watch this film",The Cloverfield Paradox
