0,TheLittleSongbird,"Fast, furious, zany and most importantly...fun!",10,29 April 2011,"Leslie Nielson's death last November was a big shock to me. Sure he has been in some bad films, such as 2001:A Space Travesty, but he had also made some quintessential classics such as Airplane, the only film of his career I consider better than this, and the Naked Gun series, of which this is the best. Whatever the outcome of the film, that doesn't stop me from considering Nielson a comedy genius.The Naked Gun:From the Files of Police Squad! is fast, furious, zany and most importantly, enormous fun film. While it looks great, is wonderfully directed, brilliantly paced with seldom a dull moment and has energetic music and a fun story, it is the humour and acting that really makes this film so good.The dialogue is deliciously dry-witted, and the plentiful juvenile gags never cease to be hilarious. Nielson gives one of his career's best performances in a wonderfully deadpan characterisation as an likable inept character. The support performances from Priscilla Presley, George Kennedy and OJ Simpson are equally great, but special mention has to go to Riccardo Montalban who just oozes cool.Overall, a hilarious film. Forget rubbish like Disaster Movie, 2001:A Space Travesty, Meet the Spartans and Epic Movie and watch the classic spoof movies like Young Frankenstein, Airplane, Galaxy Quest and this. You won't regret it! 10/10 Bethany Cox",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
1,Leofwine_draca,Laugh-a-minute gag-fest,9,21 January 2015,"I don't think there's really any criticism you can level at THE NAKED GUN: it's juvenile, sure, and very silly, but it also happens to be one of the best comedies of the 1980s (a decade packed to the seams with genre titles), surpassed only by the even-better sequel. It's a laugh-a-minute gag fest which delightfully spoofs movies in general, so the more you've seen, the funnier it becomes.It's also one of those films that everyone seems to have seen countless times, so to recount the plot would be a waste of time. Leslie Nielsen has never been better as the bumbling Frank Drebin, a cop who creates chaos wherever he goes in the best slapstick tradition. Supporting him are George Kennedy as the straight man and Priscilla Presley (ex-wife of Elvis) as his love interest, while O. J. Simpson proves unexpectedly amusing as another cop.The movie's scattershot approach means that the gags come thick and fast, so even if you don't enjoy one you'll soon forget it as another will be along almost straight away. Truly this is one of the greats of the decade, a film you can never tire of watching.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
2,SnoopyStyle,The team continues,8,29 March 2014,"LAPD Lieutenant Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) is a bumbling police officer who seems to always come out on top. In Beirut, he breaks up a meeting of America's enemies. He comes back to LA to find his wife gone, his friend detective Nordberg (O.J. Simpson) gunned down at the docks, and Queen Elizabeth coming for a visit. While investigating Nordberg's shooting, he becomes suspicious of businessman Vincent Ludwig (Ricardo Montalban) while Vicent's assistant Jane Spencer (Priscilla Presley) catches his eye immediately.This is the Zuckers-Abrahams brand of parody comedy. After a short stint as a TV show, they reform 'Police Squad!' to make this police procedural spoof. These guys have sharpened their formula. At this point, their kind of comedy is still fresh. And it's always great to have Leslie Nielsen's goofiness.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
3,mark.waltz,Once is not enough.....,7,15 March 2016,"Like the 1980 comedy classic ""Airplane!"", the first of the ""Naked Gun"" movies is a gem. It isn't an excellent film like ""Airplane!"" was, but it sure is an improvement over ""Airplane II"" which stalled the Zucker/Abrams films for almost a decade. A major part of ""Airplane!"", but other than flashbacks, absent from ""Airplane II"", Leslie Nielsen is back, this time in the lead and repeating his role of Lt. Frank Drebbin from the brief TV series ""Police Squad"". His squad team is new for the movies, and it includes a very funny George Kennedy and the accident prone O.J. Simpson whose mishaps will create hysterical laughs more for his personal life than for the funny way his basically decent character is abused.The opening shows many long deceased world leaders being confronted by Nielsen in a very funny way, and from there comes in the opening credits, basically the same from the T.V. series, only with the title changed, and missing the special guest star credit that was a gag in every episode. (My personal favorites were Florence Henderson doing a Wesson commercial and being confronted by a disgruntled fan and Abraham Lincoln reacting to a shooter while at Ford's Theater.) The theme of the credits would remain a part of the series and were often some of the funniest bits in the show, including a bit of T&A (for those who like that sort of thing) and sometimes even a celebrity cameo that parodied their real life.There's a great villain, played by real-life good guy Ricardo Montalban, and a gorgeous heroine, played by the angelic looking Priscilla Presley. Sexual innuendos provide laughs, and even if they could now be considered bad taste (particularly Nielsen ending out on a ledge of Montalban's condo complex, accidentally assaulting one of his neighbors with a concrete phallic symbol), you would have to be rather prissy to be offended by it all. Jeanette Charles, who more than just slightly resembles Queen Elizabeth II, is the victim of an assassination attempt, first seen in an encounter with Nielsen that puts her in an embarrassing ""position"", and later at a baseball game where she finds herself rather ""inconvenienced"" by passing sodas and hot dogs down the line in the royal box. The wonderfully imperious Nancy Marchand is hysterically funny as the mayor of L.A. (female and white, quite the opposite of L.A.'s then mayor Tom Bradley), and I longed for her in the next two movies where other imperious women replaced her in similar parts.This is a film that you must see at least every couple of years, not only for the gags that you've forgotten, but for those you may have missed along the way on previous viewings. Certainly, this is what was considered a ""popcorn"" film back when the movie theaters were loaded with those (and not overwhelmed with noisy special effects), but it is definitely a crowd pleaser. Back in the time of its release, it probably was a film that guys dragged their girlfriends to (revenge for being dragged to chick flicks), but sometime tells me that even the ladies in the crowd could laugh at the delicious un-p.c. themes of the story, which slight at best and predictable, always keep you on your feet. The conclusion with the villain getting their come-uppance is delightfully disgusting, and of course, the best is saved for O.J. who could only scream ""It Hertz!"" as he takes lump after lump. Oh if only justice had been served that way during the trial of the century, but fortunately the ""Naked Gun"" movies allow us to laugh at him, as well as with him, because no matter how much he is hated now, you can't help but agree that he was a good sport.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
4,Sleepin_Dragon,Classic comedy.,9,21 March 2021,"Time has been very kind to this movie, watching it earlier I was reminded just why I used to watch this multiple times as a teen. The humour is as rich, outlandish and hilarious as it was when it first launched.Nice Beaver! A scene I must have warn out on the VHS back in the day, incredibly funny.Leslie Nielsen did a remarkable job, and even though it's a spoof, be plays it with true sincerity, it's well made, and well produced, it's guaranteed to put a smile on your face, even if you're a little down in the dumps.I still love it, 9/10.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
5,classicsoncall,"""How hot and wet do you like it?""",7,30 September 2016,"Relatively young viewers won't be in on the opening scene gag when a host of terrorist world leaders get spoofed - Idi Amin, Yasser Arafat, Muammar Khaddafi, Mikhail Gorbachev and Ayatollah Khameini. There's even a Vladimir Putin look alike who turns out to be a guy named Pahpshmir later on in the story; that was kind of prescient as Putin himself didn't come on the world scene until around 1999/2000. So was that a lucky prophetic guess or what? I just have to shake my head.I like these kinds of films where the sight and sound gags come a mile a minute, they have a way of keeping the viewer on his toes. It's all nonsense of course, like the sign in a warehouse stating 'Attention - All employees must wash hands before using restroom'. You really have to seek that one out, aware that the film makers didn't always draw direct attention to them but did some of their work with a subtlety to be admired.And then there are the gags that come at you like a hammer blow, like Lieutenant Drebin's (Leslie Neilsen) ill fated attempt to infiltrate Vincent Ludwig's (Ricardo Montalban) office, filled with fine art and exotic collections. Then at one point out of nowhere, we get treated to Herman Hermit's hit 'Somethin' Tells Me I'm Into Somethin' Good'. The kicker of course when it comes to hindsight, is the appearance of O.J. Simpson. You would think that with this exposure to police detective tactics, he might have put them to good use one day in seeking out the real killer.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
6,gavin6942,Modern Comedy Classic,7,25 November 2015,"Incompetent cop Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) has to foil an attempt to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II.Leslie Nielsen really made a name for himself with goofy comedies. The best, of course, was ""Airplane!"". But the ""Naked Gun"" series was nothing to sneeze at. While I would not personally say the first is the best in the series, if it had not been successful we would never have seen parts two or three or possibly even other Nielsen movies. So, thank you.There is bathroom humor, sexual innuendo, and other crude elements. But there is also a fair amount of clever wordplay, and we see this is a smarter comedy than the more modern gross-out films (such as ""American Pie""). This is the sort of comedy we should be emulating.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
7,lee_eisenberg,Only Leslie Nielsen could do this!,10,19 January 2006,"For sheer goof-ball exuberance, you needn't look any further than ""The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!"". Leslie Nielsen remains forever associated with the role of inept Lt. Frank Drebin, who always tries to do the right thing but always makes a mess of everything. Here, he's trying to foil an assassination attempt on Queen Elizabeth. Since this is from the people behind ""Airplane!"", it means that much of the humor derives from twisted dialogue and things popping out of the background. To crown it all, there's even a guest appearance by ""Weird Al"" Yankovic as himself. Also starring are Priscilla Presley, George Kennedy, O.J. Simpson, and Ricardo Montalban.And to think that Leslie Nielsen started out in movies like ""Forbidden Planet""!",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
8,jboothmillard,The Naked Gun,10,13 September 2005,"Based on the short-lived TV series Police Squad, and from the geniuses that created Airplane! comes this brilliant spy spoof comedy that made an even bigger star of the once serious character actor. Basically Lieutenant Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) is the clumsy and not all intelligent police detective working in the division of Los Angeles Police Department. When his colleague and best friend Nordberg (O.J. Simpson) is shot and recovering in hospital, the underground investigation leads him to suspect businessman Vincent Ludwig (Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan's Ricardo Montalban) is up to something. He is planning to brainwash someone to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II (Jeannette Charles) visiting the United States, and he gets his personal assistant Jane Spencer (Priscilla Presley) to distract him from the case. Eventually, after many stupid mishaps and embarrassing accidents, Frank comes to the conclusion that the assassination attempt will take place at a major league baseball game the Queen will be attending. In the end, Frank stops the brainwashed player, Ludwig gets what he deserves, and Jane admits that she loves him for real, all just in time for Nordberg arriving fully recovered. Also starring George Kennedy as Ed Hocken, Nancy Marchand as Mayor, Raye Birk as Pahpshmir, Susan Beaubian as Mrs. Nordberg, Ed Williams as Ted Olsen, 'Weird Al' Yankovic as 'Weird Al' and Lawrence Tierney as Angels Manager. Nielsen is fantastic as the bumbling spy who says and does the stupidest things, but you can't help but love him, from the opening police siren with catchy theme music and onwards, the scripting is witty, and the slapstick, sight and gross out gags are hilarious, it certainly deserves it place in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, a superb comedy. Detective Frank Drebin was number 47 on The World's Greatest Comedy Characters, and the film was number 14 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Outstanding!",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
9,rmax304823,Fast and zany parody of policiers.,8,3 July 2008,"I have to hand it to the Zuckers and Abrahams. This is really funny, a send-up of every crime movie you've ever seen, something about a plot to assassinate Queen Elizabeth during her visit to Los Angeles. It borrows from every place. There's a scene lifted directly from Don Siegel's ""Telefon."" Some of the first-person narration quotes Raymond Chandler: ""Her hair was the color of gold in old paintings."" Most of the jokes are original, though, and half loony. Some don't work -- a car pulls into a parking space at the docks and knocks a screaming man into the water. Others are so outlandish as to be almost surreal.In the opening scene, Detective Nordberg (a depressing but still effective O. J. Simpson) creeps up, gun drawn, to a door behind which a dozen hoodlums are negotiating the purchase of a horde of dope. He takes a deep breath and kicks against the door. The door doesn't swing open. Instead, Simpson's foot crashes through the panel and he must extract it and fiddle with the knob. By the time he gets the door opens and announces that everyone is under arrest, the gang has their own guns loaded, cocked, and aimed at him. They shoot him six times. Instead of slumping to the deck, he caroms around the walls, shouting in pain when he bunks his head against some pipes, when he puts his hand on a red hot wood stove, when he leans against a wall of fresh paint, when a window slams down on his hand, when he steps into a bear trap, and so on.Simpson winds up in the hospital. While preparing to visit him, Lt. Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielson) asks how he's doing. Nielson's boss, George Kennedy, tells him solemnly, ""The doctors say he has a 50/50 chance of living, though there's only a ten percent chance of that."" In other words, there is a ten percent chance that Simpson has a fifty percent chance of living. To put it more simply, that's 1/20 or p = .05. I'd be happy to clarify this further by using base-8 math but I don't know how.The doctors tending Simpson tell his wife, ""We think we can save your husband's arm. Where would you like it sent?"" I don't think I want to go any farther with the plot because it's really insignificant, just a frame to hang a lot of jokes on. And I don't want to give any more of the jokes away.Well, one more. The voices tell me to do it. Nielson makes a harrowing escape across the facade of a tall building, hanging on to decorative human figures as he goes, breaking off the penis of one of the male figures, before he crashes through a window and into the bedroom of a half-dressed shrieking woman, and dizzily brandishes the broken-off tool. The mayor charges him with ""searching without a warrant, breaking and entering, arson, and assault with a concrete dildo."" You'll have to see the movie to get the rest of them. It's ribald and hilarious.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
10,Tweekums,Non-stop laughs as Lt Frank Drebin tries to stop an assassin,8,24 March 2016,"Lt Frank Drebin of 'Police Squad' is back. After dealing with a group of well known 'Enemies of America' he returns to Los Angeles and is given the job of organising the security during a visit from Queen Elizabeth II. He is also investigating the shooting of his colleague Detective Nordberg; this leads him to businessman Vincent Ludwig, who is coincidentally involved in the organisation of the Queen's visit. It isn't long before Frank learns that Ludwig is involved in a plot to assassinate the Queen but unfortunately burns the evidence.Anybody hoping for a gritty drama will be sorely disappointed; this film features a series of gags that don't stop from start to finish. In fact the jokes come so thick and fast that if one gag doesn't work the next one will follow seconds later. The jokes are delightfully silly. Leslie Nielsen does a great job as Lt. Drebin; managing to keep a straight face in a variety of ridiculous situations. Ricardo Montalban impresses as the villain Ludwig and Priscilla Presley puts in a fun performance as love interest Jane. It is hard to pick out highlights as it is all pretty funny; I did particularly enjoy OJ Simpson's early scene where Nordberg confronts Ludwig's men, the scene where Frank ends up on top of the Queen and the final baseball game. Overall I'd definitely recommend this classic comedy to anybody who enjoyed the TV series or enjoys silly laughs.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
11,ma-cortes,Lots of silly laughs with great entertainment and fun,7,13 October 2006,"This likable silly farce with numberless comedy set pieces deals about the Agent Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) , he is assigned by Mayor (Nancy Marchand) to protect the Queen of England and thwart the plans of a cunning baddie (Ricardo Montalban) . Frank along with captain Ed (George Kennedy) must investigate the attempt murder of his mate policeman (O.J.Simson) . Meanwhile , he falls in love with a gorgeous woman (Priscilla Presley) . This is a hilarious parody of the TV series :¨Police squad¨ with a similar premise to ¨Airplane¨ and ¨Top secret¨ . The spoof is surrealist , extreme and gross-out , but is also bold and intelligent with a myriad of imaginative sketches with no sense , slapdash and slapstick . The picture contains an unstopped string of gags each thirty seconds and silly jokes ; from start to finish the up-roaring comedy and humor result to be interminable , that's why the viewers will laugh uncontrollably . Habitual quirky and lunatic roles , especially reincarnated by Nielsen as a deadpan , idiot detective . Most of the laughs and sight gags galore work acceptably , particularly the jokes with the Queen's reception fiasco ; however, the overlong gags about the baseball are dull and boring . The picture is well screen-written and realized by Jim Abrahams and brothers Jerry , David Zucker (ZAZ) , parody pioneers and longtime collaborators with successful work making their own comedy troupe . Rated PG (parents guide) for some sexually , gags with occasional adult content and profanities . Followed by two inferior sequels with similar actors , elements and characters :¨The smell of fear¨ and ¨The final insult¨ . The film will appeal to absurd , unruly , wacky comedy fans . The movie is a Nielsen vehicle ,if you like his crazy , manic performance , you'll enjoy this one .",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
12,moonspinner55,Nothing wrong with a little slapstick--but that's all this is,5,25 June 2005,"Theatrical expansion of the failed TV show ""Police Squad!"" managed to catch on with laugh-hungry audiences of the late '80's and became a surprise success. The plot is really secondary to the sketches as eternally stupid police lieutenant Frank Drebin acts as bodyguard to the Queen of England on her visit to the US. Leslie Nielsen has 'befuddled' down to an expert science, but this comedy, although way out there at times for the sake of a gag, is weak in spots and pretty much follows the same skit-like pattern of its second cousin, ""Airplane!"" A few big laughs, but it totally fizzles out before the finale. Followed by two sequels, the last of which even managed to succeed this original in terms of outrageousness, appealing to that silly side of our collective humor while keeping the brain in neutral.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
13,Quinoa1984,The Zucker's best. Nielson's best as well,10,9 April 2000,"ZAZ's(David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker) The Naked Gun is one of the funniest (if not funniest) film ever with more parodies and gags than one could ever imagine.  And the writing is if not good, great that never lets up (even through the finale baseball game with Reggie Jackson). 
But what really gets this film up there is it's main characters.  Leslie Nielson has never been better and probably won;t ever be this good ever again.  He brings an insane type of humor from a cop that hasn't been seen since Clouseau.  The supporting characters are good also, including Priscilla Pressley, George Kennedy, Ricardo Montebaum, Nancy Marchand and (odd to see him in a movie today) OJ Simpson.  There zany characters and added with a great script make this a treasure in cinema comedy.  One of the best films of the 80's.  A++",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!

15,Hey_Sweden,"This is our hill, and these are our beans.",8,28 February 2021,"Six years after the fact, the talented comedy filmmakers Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and David Zucker resurrected their sadly short-lived sitcom 'Police Squad!' for the big screen. They had a great deal of success in the process, proving their status as masters at this particular brand of parody. Leslie Nielsen was brought back on board to reprise his role of intrepid and none-too-bright police detective Lt. Frank Drebin.After Frank has beat up and embarrassed various international despots in a priceless opening scene, he returns to L.A. He is soon investigating the attempted killing of his colleague Nordberg (with O.J. Simpson inheriting the role from Peter Lupus). This leads him to a suave, rich businessman (Ricardo Montalban, well cast) who is putting into motion a plan to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II.Have no fear: despite not being the brightest bulb in the drawer, Frank *does* take his job seriously, and can often succeed despite his buffoonery. Nielsen is just so damn great and deadpan as a man who is indeed one of the dumbest officers of the law since the days of Inspector Clouseau. He's surrounded by capable co-stars: Priscilla Presley as his pratfalling leading lady, George Kennedy as his superior Ed Hocken (inheriting *his* role from Alan North), the slick Mr. Montalban as the confident villain, Nancy Marchand from 'The Sopranos' as the mayor, and players from the TV series such as Ed Williams (as lab man Ted Olson) and ""Tiny"" Ron (as Al, the detective so tall his head won't fit in the frame). Add to that hilarious cameos by a couple of famous faces, and bits by character actors such as Lawrence Tierney, Joe Grifasi and Nicholas Worth, and you have a cast that's compulsively watchable.The Z.A.Z. boys showed that they still had what it took to create a winning spoof, after their previous classics ""Airplane!"" and ""Top Secret!"". They are actually able to sustain their material for a lively and engaging hour and a half, even though the pacing DOES admittedly slow down during the big baseball game finale. They come up with absolutely priceless lines of dialogue and memorable gags. In the tradition of spoofs, there are gags included that a viewer might miss on their first viewing. A sequence where Frank attempts to get the goods on Victor Ludwig is just ONE of the highlights. Making his debut as the sole director, David Zucker guides it all in style; the Z.A.Z. boys also wrote the script along with Pat Proft, another veteran of this kind of comedy.""The Naked Gun"" is bright and irresistible right to the end, with yet another setback occurring for the eternally hard-luck Nordberg.Followed by two sequels.Eight out of 10.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!

17,grantss,Hilarious,8,11 July 2014,"Hilarious slapstick-comedy. Clever, witty dialogue and brilliant sight- gags. So quotable. The problem with these types of movies is that once the initial novelty wears off, the movie runs out of ideas, leaving the last half of the movie quite lame. Naked Gun doesn't have this problem. It stays original, unpredictable and funny right until the end. It also knows when to end.Great performance by Leslie Nielsen in the lead role. Can't think of too many other comedians or actors who could have pulled off the role. George Kennedy is solid as the straight man to Nielsen's clown.Probably the movie that started the run of spoof genre movies of the late-80s/early-90s.

19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"""That's why I went to Beirut... to relax.""",8,7 May 2012,"Frank Drebin(Nielsen) is an old school cop. A hard-ass. He's also remarkably incompetent. He gets a tip that an important businessman(played by Khan himself, so you know he's evil!) is smuggling heroin, and when he meets with him to try to find out, he is introduced to Jane(Presley), and they fall for each other so hard that they appear in every scene from all montages that have ever been in Hollywood films. He also has to foil an assassination attempt on Queen Elizabeth. This is one of the best spoofs I've ever seen. It fits in all the clichés from the ""tough police officer"" investigative crime thrillers. The Zuckers know exactly what they're doing... varying the marvelously written and planned jokes and gags, at times having only a single element in a sequence be ""off""(and thus everyone else react realistically, and the laws of physics behave as they should, other than this one thing) so that the contrast heightens the impact, and, in the midst of all of this, there's actually a plot, and we do care about the characters, we want to see the good guys win and the bad guys burn. Sure, we're laughing on account of the slapstick, silliness, clever lines and wordplay, still, we also want to see what happens next, how it progresses(even for it following the simple formula of the genre it's referencing). And somehow, even when it goes where we expect it to, we're immensely entertained by the trip there(which might surprise anyway, in some of the details). I mean, when Leslie, already having been established as being clumsy, is told that this fish in the tank is expensive and rare, and that that pen is priceless, and tolerant of everything but water, we know where the bit is headed. There is a little moderate to strong language and sexuality, as well as brief female nudity. I recommend this to any fan of parody. 8/10",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
20,view_and_review,Not Police Academy and That's Good,7,2 October 2019,"The goal of a spoof film is to be creatively absurd. Some spoofs go for crass sophomoric mockery and its more juvenile than funny. Some spoofs go for clever mockery and the jokes just fall flat. Naked Gun was creative at times, sophomoric at times, slapstick at times, and clever at times. Collectively, it was a good movie. I didn't laugh my butt off throughout but even the non-funny parts were good.

From the people that brought you ""Airplane!"" comes a comedy in a similar vein, stuffed with one-liners and sight gags. Leslie Nielsen is perfect for this kind of comedy. He's droll and oblivious to the absurdity around him. He takes everything completely seriously but manages to make fun of himself in the process somehow anyway. It's hard to explain but you'll see what I mean when you watch the movie.Ever since ""The Naked Gun"" was released in 1988, it's been one of those movies I watch every once in a while when I just want some mindless entertainment or when there's nothing else on, and it never fails to disappoint.

23,Aaron1375,Rather funny spoof spawned from the short lived television show.,7,5 December 2010,"Of the spoof films that Leslie Nielson has starred in, this is probably his second best film behind the super funny ""Airplane"". To me, nothing can really top his performance in that one because he was so deadly serious while all this insane stuff was happening. He was rather good here to as Lt. Frank Drebin as this character does his stuff rather seriously too. Though he does get a bit more goofy with this role than the one in ""Airplane"". This movie sort of came about thanks to ""Police Squad"", a very short running television show that I loved when I was a kid. It was just so funny with all the puns and crazy situations. This film is not quite up there with the show, almost just not quite. It has the same energy for the most part, but I thought it fizzled a bit in places too. The story has Frank trying to uncover a plot to assassinate the Queen of England. His main suspect is a character played by Ricardo Montalban who is really good in this one too. Along the way Frank meets Jane Spencer played by Priscilla Presley and they have a very romantic day suffice to say. The jokes for the most part come at a fast pace, I did not really like the ending baseball game all that much though. It was funny, just not like the rest of the film though I did enjoy the villain's demise. A funny spoof, kind of nice seeing O.J. Simpson really taking the punishment in this one too.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
24,Wuchakk,Easily the best of the goofy trilogy,8,31 January 2015,"The three ""Naked Gun"" movies from 1988, 1991 and 1994 are all extremely goofy comedies starring Lesley Nielsen, Priscilla Presley, George Kennedy and OJ Simpson. They're consistently amusing and, pretty much, interchangeable. If you like one, you'll like 'em all. Priscilla was one of the most beautiful women to walk the planet in her prime and looks great in these films. The first two were hugely successful at the box office; the third one didn't do bad, but nowhere near as good. Whether or not you prefer one to another depends on the story and guest stars. In my opinion, this first one is easily the best simply because it's more consistently amusing and often laugh-out-loud funny, which explains my high grade.As for the two sequels go, I slightly prefer part 3, but all three come in handy when you want to turn off your brain and enjoy something silly.The film runs 85 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area and San Diego.GRADE: A-",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
25,safenoe,Hilarious even though...,9,28 November 2016,"I saw The Naked Gun before 1994 and even now it is a fine comedy, definitely top class in hilarity. I know, I know, there's the specter of O.J. Simpson, but unless all his scenes should be deleted (would that be breaching the First Amendment perhaps? I'd have to ask a constitutional lawyer), the movie is still a fine comedy. But I can appreciate if this tarnishes the movie.There are so many laugh-out-loud moments, starting from the opening scene where Frank Drebin (Leslie ""The Poseidon Adventure"" Nielsen) battles the Axis of Evil and then some, even rubbing off the birthmark off Mikhail Gorbachev's head (""I knew it!!!"").I heard there may be a reboot of The Naked Gun, and it would be interesting to see who is cast.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
26,The_Void,Incredibly funny comedy,8,12 July 2004,"What makes The Naked Gun so funny is it's small moments; things like when Leslie Nielson knocks a fisherman of the pier when parking his car, when he and Priscilla Presley come out of a movie laughing, only for the audience to see that the movie they just left was 'Platoon', the part at the baseball game where a fan shouts ""It's Enrico Pallazzo!""; those are the really funny moments in The Naked Gun. That's not to say the bigger gags, such as the part where Detective Nordberg is shot or the thing with the fish don't work, but it's the film's attention to detail that is most definitely it's main asset.The Naked Gun opens with an utterly hilarious sequence which sees a police siren, obviously atop of a police car parade through all sorts of areas that it isn't supposed to, all done to a backdrop of very farcical music. From this point on, you know you're going to be in for a lot of silliness, and if it's silliness you want, The Naked Gun is definitely your film. The plot of the movie is largely irrelevant, and serves only as a means to spoof several clichés of the police thriller genre; which is all the plot should serve as in a gag based comedy such as this.Leslie Nielson is the perfect man for this sort of film, as he has proved over and over; even when he's stood doing nothing he looks silly; he has a look that is made for comedy, and this is his finest hour. This movie is also the finest hour for the ZAZ team; unlike with the messy and largely unfunny ""Airplane!"", they've managed to get almost everything spot on here. The jokes are funny; for every one that doesn't work, there's twenty that do, the lead man is on top form and the situation is silly enough to provide lots of room for gags, and that room is filled as far as is possible.If you're more a fan of intelligent comedy, then I recommend checking out The Naked Gun anyway because I very much doubt that anyone can sit through this movie without laughing. Forget ""Airplane!"", THIS is the finest ZAZ comedy.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
27,SimonJack,A very funny modern slapstick cops and robbers,8,13 September 2019,"""The Naked Gun"" is a hilarious adult film that is a ""modern day"" slapstick comedy. Not since the mid-20th century had there been a slapstick film in the ilk of those of the silent and golden ages of Hollywood. The Marx Brothers and Three Stooges were the last of such films. Some may see this as slight spoofing of the police and crime films and series that were so common into the final decades of the 20th century. But, it's not hard to imagine that someone would eventually capitalize on all the crime and mystery films and series by making a clearly slapstick comedy.The creators of ""The Naked Gun"" surely saw ""The Pink Panther"" of 1963. That film sort of opened the door to the main police character being something of a quirky character, if not an outright buffoon. The sequels with Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau reinforced the appeal of such comedy with audiences.This film has an extended title, ""From the Files of Police Squad."" That's an obvious reference to the source of the material for the film. The 1982 ABC TV series, ""Police Squad"" ran just six episodes. But all the half hour shows were hilarious. British TV may have led the return of such slapstick with the BBC Comedy series, ""Monty Python's Flying Circus,"" that ran from 1969 through 1974.There were other films that were clear spoofs of the great detectives of literary fiction and film. ""Murder by Death"" of 1976 spoofed all the best known and great detectives of fiction. Some comedies right after the ""Police Squad"" series were about police (""Police Academy"" of 1984 and sequels), but none were on the level of slapstick in ""The Naked Gun."" Nor were any others as funny.So, this film was not so much a satire of police forces or police and crime films. It was instead a plain, but riotously funny slapstick film about a police officer and his equally wacky cohorts and sidekicks. The cast for the film is superb, with Leslie Nielsen and George Kennedy providing the bulk of humor. The film is obviously adult, although it's rated PG-13. It borders on the edge of crass and crude in a couple of instances.Nielsen's character, Frank Drebin, is so unique that he's a police sergeant detective lieutenant. A sergeant-lieutenant? That's an unheard-of rank in the annals of police forces and military. Drebin's scenario as an umpire in a professional baseball game must be one of the funniest sports scenes ever filmed in a movie.This is one very funny film that most adults should enjoy. It's probably not for people who don't have much of a sense of humor or who can't laugh at everyday things in life.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
28,Mr-Fusion,"Right up there with ""Airplane!""",8,24 February 2017,"The police procedural, now there's a subgenre that can use a good parody; and ""The Naked Gun"" is more than happy to offer those services. There's no weak link in this cast, and both Nancy Marchand and Ricardo Montalban ably serve as straight men to the rest of the players. The obvious MVP here is Leslie Nielsen and it's no surprise how he's attained legendary status in this field. As a kid, we used to have HBO in the house for a while, and this was played almost on a loop. Age has done nothing to dull this film's charm; the gags come at you one after the next and some aren't easy to pull off. It's all unbelievably silly, and I mean that in the best way possible. This is one of those rare gems that really brightens your day. 8/10",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
29,namashi_1,Leslie Nielsen Rocks!,10,24 April 2011,"Leslie Nielsen Rocks! 'The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!', proves that fact, evidently. An amazing performance, that deserves the highest amounts of praises. He plays it dumb, with such flexibility, that you actually leave this slap-stick comedy with happiness.'The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!', is directed by David Zucker, a legend in his own right. Zucker has even written the film along-with his legendary combo of Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams & Pat Proft. This one's a fast-paced slapstick comedy, that includes a lot of visual and verbal puns and gags, and chronicles the adventures of Nielsen's character, the bumbling police Lieutenant Frank Drebin.There are hilarious moments all through. The Writing is absurd, funny & lively. It succeeds by holding your attention completely, from start to end. The dialogue, are outrageous, but so very innovative at the same time. Zucker has had a ball making this flick, and his excitement reflects on the screen each minute. Cinematography by Robert M. Stevens, captures each and every moment, wonderfully.Leslie Nielsen can never die in the memory of film-buffs, like me and many more. His performance here, according to me, ranks as one of the most intelligently funny performances of all-times. A special mention for Priscilla Presley, for her sincere & likable performance in here.On the whole, Don't miss this one! Logic can be over-looked for sometime.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
30,StevePulaski,A parody movie that serves it's purpose,9,4 December 2010,"Due to Leslie Nielson's tragic and untimely death, I decided to visit one of his many films I haven't had the pleasure of seeing. I saw Airplane many years ago, I saw Scary Movie 3 and 4 in the theaters, and saw Creepshow last fall. I didn't however see Nielsen's parody films which made him famous like The Naked Gun trilogy and Spy Hard. So I finally put one on to watch what I had missed...22 years later.It's true you don't know what you have until it's gone, and you appreciate it/them more when they're gone. I knew who Corey Haim was before he died and saw License to Drive a couple months before his death, but became somewhat obsessed with him when he died. Same thing applies with Michael Jackson, Greg Giraldo, and a number of others. Leslie Nielsen may be a victim to my awkward obsession. After watching this gem, he very well could be. If that's a good thing.Leslie plays Frank Drebbin a policy officer who likes to think he is doing a good job, when really, he doesn't know what he is doing, and when he tries to do something good, he gets himself and others hurt. Drebbin now has to protect Queen Elizabeth II from being assassinated at a California Angels baseball game during the seventh inning stretch. Although the plot sounds very serious, it delivers an uncountable number of laughs in the process.Going into this, aware of it being a parody/spoof film, I was nothing but skeptical. A parody film? Hasn't that genre been beaten, trashed, abused, and spat on by the duo of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer? But in the eighties and nineties, David Zucker knew how to be funny and original simultaneously. Rather than cramming over thirty pop culture characters/references that, most of the time, lack a purpose or dimension, Zucker took in a cop that wanted to do the right thing but unknowingly made matters either unclear or even worse than they already were.The goal for a parody film is to make it play like a regular film. It's supposed to feel like an actual film, but it should poke fun at all of the movie clichés (i.e. comforting wife when husband was in ER). One cop would never bring up the worst possible outcomes that could happen to the wife when her husband is in the hospital bed near death. So in a nutshell, when constructing a parody film, don't focus on setting a record for the most pop culture characters utilized in an eighty minute film. Make it like a real film and just poke fun at common clichés.The Naked Gun is definitely a winner, and probably takes the cake for my favorite parody film. Leslie Nielsen's acting was memorable as well my first time seeing O.J. Simpson acting in anything. I never thought I'd say or type this but, we have a great parody film on our hands.Starring: Leslie Nielsen, Priscilla Presley, Ricardo Montalbán, George Kennedy, O. J. Simpson, and Nancy Marchand. Directed by: David Zucker.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
31,Smells_Like_Cheese,One of the funniest movies... ever!,10,29 November 2004,"I usually like to rent movies at least twice a month. The only catch is that I don't like taking my friends, because I like to read and I know this sounds silly, but concentrate on the movies that I'd like to see. Just because I don't like to see movies that I know will be bad. But my friends and I were out and I mentioned how I was going to rent movies that night. They asked if they could come, and I couldn't say ""no"". That would just be horrible to say, and especially with my silly theory. I saw ""Naked Gun"" sitting there, and my friend asked me if I ever saw this movie, and I said ""no"". She said that this would be the movie to watch for a good laugh. So, I decided for once to let go and rent. I was glad that I did. This is by far one of the funniest movies I have seen. You can't take it seriously, but that's what I love about it. It's a great movie. I would recommend it for comedy lovers.10/10",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
32,DKosty123,Slapstick The Way It Should Be Done,9,1 October 2016,"This film has aged, but it is so funny still as the jokes never really get old. It starts with a farcical meeting of Middle East Leaders in Beiruit, Lebanon, and then delves into a credit sequence so classic that is was recently borrowed and enhanced on one of those Seth Mcfarlene animated series. (or was it another series).So where do we belong here? OJ Simpson gets drilled by gunmen before his infamous murder trial and still people do not get where this movie is going? There is so much going on and so many cameos from famous folks in the era that even the Queen of England though central to the plot is really a second fiddle here.Ricardo Montoban is a prefect straight man to play the main bad guy who bumbles his way along a step behind Frank Drevin (Neilsen). The roles are so perfect that everyone in the movie shines. Even Reggie Jackson gets treated better here than he did when he introduced Reggie candy bars.The throw away lines in this one are better than a lot of comedy films. I have to wonder if the writers on an inside joke were sticking their tongs out at a public not smart enough to watch Police Squad? Could be",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!

This movie is worth watching if you enjoyed Nelson in films like 'Airplane!' and 'Dracula: Dead And Loving It'.If you enjoyed The Naked Gun or other Nelson films then you might like other comedy movies with a similar theme (goofy police, spies, detectives type films): 'Fletch', 'Police Academy', 'Turner and Hooch', 'Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid' or 'Spies Like Us'.The Naked Gun is a spoof, and if another comedy spoof is what you want then try such films as 'Robin Hood: Men in Tights', 'Galaxy Quest', 'Spaceballs' or even 'Young Frankenstein'.8.5/10",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
34,OllieSuave-007,Side-splitting funny - Nielson at some of his best!,10,22 November 2013,"This is a comedy-spoof from David and Jerry Zucker, a film based on the short-lived TV series, Police Squad, starring Leslie Nielson as Lt. Frank Drebin, where we get to see the blundering Los Angeles police detective attempting to protect the visiting Queen Elizabeth from an assassin.It's non-stop laughs from start to finish that will send tears to your eyes and have you holding your stomaches. The plot elements from an earlier Zucker spoof also starring Nielseon, Airplane!, are in this movie: calm and serious characters delivering outrageous comedic lines and action; slapstick comedy like Jane Spencer (Priscilla Presley) falling down a flight of stairs and bumping into walls and Drebin getting bit by a $25,000 lion-fish; on-site gags like fences with automatic spray-paint to target graffiti vandals, stun guns coming out of cuff links, and Nielson harassing a concrete statue; and absurd, inside jokes.I first watched this film when I was a little kid and remembered it as being one of the funniest movies I've seen at that time, recalling such scenes as Drebin sending Queen Elizabeth flying across a table and the automatic piano in villain Vincent Ludwig's (Ricardo Montalban) office.With all the jokes, one-liners and gags in abundance, you wouldn't want to treat this movie seriously. The characters, however, seem to treat their ""mission"" seriously, giving this movie a fast-paced plot and story nonetheless, despite all the spoofed humor. I always have a fun time watching this film and there also always seem to be a new joke or gag to catch in the film every time. I just wished that I would have watched this movie in theaters when it first came out; it would have been fun being around all the audience members laughing their hearts out.With awesome acting, an exciting plot and a classical crime drama-style music score, I recommend this film to any movie-lovers. You will be thoroughly entertained! Grade A",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
35,thesar-2,"Surely, You Can Never Be Serious",9,18 September 2010,"A must-see for any Airplane!-enthusiast, The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! is so close to perfect, from beginning to end, you'll wonder why the defunct TV program didn't last. For, it's all the same jokes.Perhaps that was their gamble: only the 50 or less people who saw the show – me, included – would recognize these replayed jokes. Nevertheless, this movie is downright hilarious and it never, ever lets up or changes course.Very few creators (Abrahams, Zucker & Zucker) of comedy can achieve such heights. Despite some recent setbacks, they've been behind masters of slapstick – Airplane!, Top Secret! and this one from Police Squad! – wow, they definitely like to shout a lot. So, if you're into silly humor, like I happen to be, watch this. Of course, if you haven't already, shame on you. Check this Beaver out now.Police Squad's Frank Drebin (Nielsen) beats up innocents and terrorist alike, whether by stumbling into them or hitting them with his runaway car. But now, he MUST SAVE THE QUEEN, who happens to be visiting their town of L.A.Evil, eeeevil Vincent Ludwig (Montalban) has plans for the perfect assassin and his lovely, but blameless assistant Jane (Presley) serves her purpose of spying on Drebin. You know how the story goesFrank: It's the same old story. Boy finds girl, boy loses girl, girl finds boy, boy forgets girl, boy remembers girl, girl dies in a tragic blimp accident over the Orange Bowl on New Year's Day. Jane: Goodyear? Frank: No, the worst.This review would be increased tenfold if I was to lay out (okay, fine, copy) all the fantastic quotes, but this is a great example of what you're getting yourself into. If you like the above, you'll love the rest of the movie.And if you have seen this movie, and it's been awhile, like for me, watch it again. I practically had it memorized from seeing it probably two dozen times as a kid, and still, I was cracking up and enjoyed every last scene. Yeah, even with OJ Simpson as one of the leads.Side Note: As much as I love pure slapstick – not the crappy Vampires Suck and Disaster Movies of today - my only (SLIGHT) complaint is when they look at the camera to indicate even they think this is crazy. They do it a little too much in this movie – but not enough to downgrade the movie. Yes, my favorite comedy of all time, Airplane!, barely did it once or twice – but for 99% of that movie, it was a perfectly insane world.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
36,ElMaruecan82,"The gun might be naked, but not the Emperor...",9,25 May 2016,"(sorry for the lousy title, I needed an opening line)After the classic ""Airplane!"", the forgettable sequel and the criminally underrated ""Top Secret!"", Jim Abrahams, David and Jerry Zucker strike again after four years of creative gestation, providing what can easily be considered their consummate film. Actually, I can't decide between this and ""Top Secret!"". However, I do believe it's funnier than ""Airplane!"" for one simple reason. The disaster parody insisted a little too much on the romantic subplot, without providing funny gags to carry them, it was all the more redundant that the two leads were actually the least interesting characters of the whole film.The obvious scene-stealer in ""Airplane!"" was Leslie Nielsen and it's only fitting that he finally got to star in a ZAZ film before becoming their mascot, reprising his role as lawman Frank Drebin from the short-lived cult-series ""Police Squad"" in 1982. And who better than the late-blooming gray-haired actor with his deadpan expression delivering the most hilarious lines, to embody the humor of parody movies, which are movies that pretend to be serious about totally over-the-top and zany situations. Leslie Nielsen portrays the character of Frank Drebin as a no-nonsense guy evolving in a totally bizarre and nonsensical world. He becomes eccentric despite himself, and that's the mistake most comedies make, by having characters acting crazy in the first place.And Frank Drebin becomes a naturally comic actor, where almost each line can stand as a one-liner. Take the hospital scene where he's supposed to comfort his friend's wife, his remembrance of his ex-wife, his monologue à la Dirty Harry or Humphrey Bogart, Nielsen, with an extreme versatility, manages to fit every kind of humor, verbal and visual. And this film is real tribute to his talent, supported by no-less deserving cast, such as Nancy Marchand as the Mayor, his friend Ed Hocken played by George Kennedy and Priscilla Presley as the villain's pretty secretary falling in love with his 'funny face'. Speaking of falling, her entrance is the perfect ice-breaking moment to viewers who wanted to picture her as a glamour model. And in all that nonsense, Montalban does a great job as plays the typical suave and sinister villain.Now, is it necessary to sum up the whole plot? Let's just say that it's all about preventing the assassination of Queen Elizabeth, and that this plot only matters as a vehicle for non-stop gags, that take you from a (slightly) anti-Arab trip into Beirut to the usual staples of cop movies, starting with the unforgettable opening credits sequence, from the hilarious openina vertiginous impersonation of Harold Lloyd with the weirdest thing to hang on, a romantic montage to a climactic confrontation in a baseball stadium and a romantic declaration that make an Arab and a Jewish man have a hug, a gag that kind of redeems the opening scene. Of course, the final scene provokes a superb final sight gag that might console those who have a hard time watching OJ Simpson in such a feel-good film, but let's just accept it as the only element that dates the film..And ""The Naked Gun"" isn't just a funny film, it's a film that is so daring and so obsessed by its mission to make us laugh that no minute is wasted, each one of them is full of say, one or two gags, and the rest is only quick set-ups. This is not just a watchable but a rewatchable and a re-rewatchable film as the probability to miss some jokes will be high especially if you're busy laughing out loud from the previous gag. It's a movie that, no matter in which mood you appear to be, will put a big, big smile in your face and sometimes, there's no more explanation needed. But I have personal reasons to enjoy this film, more than another.I never really heard about the word ""parody"" until I was 11 and there was a TV special classic parodies, starting with ""The Naked Gun"". I didn't really get the difference between that and the usual comedy, not until that scene where poor Nordberg (O.J. Simpson) gets shot by a bunch of criminal, and then endures many other unfortunate accidents such as burning his hand on a stove, putting his arm on a wet paint door, his head falling on a wedding cake or his leg caught in a bear trap. Within a minute, I got the idea, and I remembered I had already seen a few movies with the same comedic zaniness like ""Spaceballs"" or ""Johnny Dangerously"". But if anything, it was ""The Naked Gun"" that introduced me to the parody genre.And till now, I can't believe that this film wasn't introduced in the American Film institute's Top 100 Comedies while other films like ""Fargo"", ""The Graduate"" or ""Big"" are there. That's a parody of listing, if I might say so.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
37,bowmanblue,Still so good,9,22 July 2019,"I first watched 'The Naked Gun' on VHS when it was released at the tail end of the eighties. I was much younger then and appreciated - how would you call it - more 'juvenile' humour. Now, some thirty years later, I was almost scared to watch it again in case it didn't live up to how I remember. All I can say is that it's either as funny as it ever was, or my humour never actually grew up. I think it's probably both, seeing as I also like the 'Jackass' movies.You may never have heard of, or never bothered with, the TV show 'Police Squad.' It wasn't on telly for very long and I believe it got cancelled after only one series. However, that didn't stop the producers from effectively reusing the story (and even some of the jokes) for their feature length film, 'The Naked Gun.' It follows the exploits of Detective Frank Drebin (played to perfection by a totally deadpan Leslie Nielsen) as he is tasked with foiling an assassination attempt on Queen Elizabeth when she visits his home city of Los Angeles, proving his partner Nordberg (creepily played by O.J. Simpson, before he, er, fell from grace - so to speak) and generally falling in love with the new lady in his life, Jane (Priscilla Presley).Now, all that sounds quite a lot to fit into what is actually quite a standard length film (roughly ninety minutes) and yet every moment flies by simply because it never wastes any time by NOT putting jokes in. In short... the gags comes thick and fast. In fact, sometimes you've only just finished laughing at one joke when another comes along. They're that closely packed in.I guess the only person who wouldn't get some amusement out of this would be someone who really despises slapstick and slightly low-brow humour. Many of the jokes are visual and revolve around the 'bumbling' antics of the leading man as he tries to unravel the conspiracy surrounding Ricardo Montalban's evil plot. And, if you've only really seen Montalban as 'Khan' from 'Star Trek II' and think he can only play things seriously, it's a treat to see him do something a little lighter than trying to hound Kirk to the ends of the galaxy.There are few films that stand the test of time and, in a world of comedies where many of the laughs revolve around 'pop culture' references, i.e. making the subject matter only funny if you 'get' the reference and it stays relevant forever, it's nice to see a film that will always be daftly funny, no matter how many years pass by.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
38,ericstevenson,Was it the last great spoof movie?,10,28 September 2016,"For a lot of people, this film happened to be the last great parody movie ever made. It seems like right after this movie, the parody genre just got worse and worse. We finally hit rock bottom with ""Disaster Movie"" ranked as the worst film of all time by the IMDb. Were people just thinking this movie was a tough act to follow? There have been zero spoof movies since that would be considered truly great. If nothing else, we can at least look back at this once great style. I heard ""Sausage Party"" was technically a spoof, but it still wasn't on the same level as these old ones. Modern spoof movies just have the characters fart and poop all the time, but these ones actually made us laugh.It is kind of weird looking back and seeing OJ in a good movie role. Of course, he does get injured in this movie a lot. This film is great from the very first jokes. I think my favorite part would be when he says, ""Bingo!"" and finds a Bingo card. This is another movie you have to pay attention to in order to get all the laughs in. I just love how this film escalates in its zaniness. Even if you've seen a compilation of best parts like me, there's still more to love. The madness doesn't even end with the credits. There's this gag where they list every person by labeling them with their dialogue! It actually does make sense, in a really amusing way. The pop culture references are a lot more subtle than other films and it works much better that way.This is what comedy should be. The slapstick is wonderfully timed. Everything comes together so well in this. There's always jokes that build up to each other and best of all, it has a coherent story. They do work hard to make these jokes relevant as to what is going on, not just random interchangeable gags. Even better is that I actually really do care about the main characters in this. I wanted them to get out okay! For all the laughs, there was good emotion here too. I didn't even know this was based on a TV show. I have seen some clips of it and it seems great too! I think the directors eventually split over arguments which is why their films have declined, ending with the worst, ""Scary Movie V"". While there are still great comedies, we'll never be restored to this level of quality in spoofs right here. May this film and its spirit live on forever! ****",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!

45,Movie Nuttball,The Naked Gun is one of the funniest movies ever!!!!,10,23 February 2002,Minor SpoilersI just laugh at this movie ever time I see it which I have seen this alot! Everything is so funny. I don`t know what part is funnier whether its when Nielson is in Ricardo`s room playing with the rare pen and the fish or when he is at the press conference or when he is up on the siding of the building or could it be the beginning of the film or could it be the great baseball game? Like I said this movie is so funny.There are two sequels to the Naked Gun but to ME this is the best of the three. If you need a good laugh or cheer someone up this is the movie to watch!,The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
46,redryan64,"""One Man's Trash is Another Man's Treasure!"" Cancelled on TV, the ""POLICE SQUAD!"" Project taken to PARAMOUNT PICTURES and the ""movies"" , with great $ucce$$!!",10,26 September 2007,"The creative team of Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker were ""overnight"" successes with the public acceptance and Box Office $ucce$$ of their AIRPLANE!(Paramount, 1980). This opened the door to them for other projects. So, to the small screen of Television Land they did travel.Utilizing the same type of ""tongue in cheek"", verbal punning and sight gag loaded spoofing humor as AIRPLANE, they chose to launch a double barreled assault on the Cop Show. The result was POLICE SQUAD!(1982).The series produced a grand total of six(6) measly episodes, but what a six episodes they were. Each was a little gem on its own, and would have worked well as those ""old time"" 2 Reelers Comedies once so popular at the theatre, featuring the likes of Laurel & Hardy, The Three Stooges, Edgar Kennedy, 'Joe McDoakes', Pete Smith, etc.Well, some joker with a position as an Executive at the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) TV Network pronounced the series as a candidate for the 'old Axe' because "".....you have to pay too much attention to the episodes on your TV."", or some such dribble.So away went ""POLICE SQUAD"" with Captain/Lieutennant/Sergeant Frank Drebbin(Leslie Nielsen), ne'er to be heard from again. WRONG! In 1988, the concept with Leslie Nielsen starring rose again as THE NAKED GUN: From The Files of Police Squad!( Paramount, 1988). It was a feature film, one that required viewing at a movie house and paying an admission. Well, with 2 sequels following, it's kinda obvious that it was successful, where it counts, with the public!* The story opens up with a scene of a big meeting of America's Enemies. Among those being portrayed are Castro, Khadaffi, Arafatt, Idi Amin, the Ayatola Khomani and others. Their meeting being broken up by the sudden appearance of Frank Drebbin, on special Government assignment.Back home in L.A., he is met at the Airport by his boss, Captain Ed Hocken(George Kennedy)who informs him of the coming visit of State by Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II to Los Angeles. A visit complicated by the Underground Operations by Some Murderous Gang of Drug Smugglers. The city Fathers are concerned over some Murders connected to them. Also, Detective Nordberg (O.J. Simpson) lies close to death in Hospital after attempting to infiltrate the Mob.The plot takes us on a merry chase, all 'round L.A., before winding up at the California Angels' ""Big A"" Ball Park in Aneheim.Without getting into particulars, let's just say that this is the Crown Jewels of the whole picture. We are treated to a succession of super gags, each as good or better than the last. The back-drop of a Baseball Game between the Angels and the Seattle Mariners provides the opportunity for Leslie Nielasen to perform a true Tour-de-Force of Comedic Performance that will remain unmatched for many a year!

51,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Nielsen takes charge of another Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker gem",7,4 June 2009,"What started in 1977 with ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" continues again in ""The Naked Gun,"" a film version of the TV series ""Police Squad!"" only this time detective/cop films are the culprit, seemingly perfect fodder for spoofing and the Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker one-two punch of subtle literalist humor and preposterous gags. The only real difference between this and 1980's ""Airplane!"" is that Lesley Nielsen takes command of this film as opposed to an all-cast effort.Nobody must be able to keep a straighter face than Nielsen. As Lt. Frank Drebin, the things he must do and say while remaining ignorant to their comedic value are absurd in quantity and quality. Drebin is when James Bond meets Inspector Clouseau -- he's completely oblivious yet he knows exactly what he's doing. As contradictory as that sounds, it's completely true. Nielsen does both incredible deadpan and slapstick, a highly specialized skill for a comedian, and unfortunately for the rest Nielsen's career, that's all he has. Nevertheless, it's perfect for ""The Naked Gun.""Unlike ""Airplane!"", this film has to be a bit more plot-focused because the cop/detective genre necessitates it. ""Airplane!"" could descend into utter chaos, whereas ""The Naked Gun"" feels obligated to make sense in some regard. All you need to know is that O.J Simpson's character got shot and the investigation leads to the uncovering of a possible assassination attempt on the life of Queen Elizabeth II. The challenge for the viewer is to forget making sense of what's going on and pay attention to the small details that make these films even funnier. In some scenes this is easier than others and for the most part, the easier it is, the better ""The Naked Gun"" gets.A lot of the times these are the laughs that make you smile inside instead of laughing out loud, but especially toward the end when the humor becomes more slapstick, ""The Naked Gun"" really takes off ... pardon the ""Airplane!"" lingo. Another fun film from these guys.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
52,funkyfry,fun spoof,7,23 May 2007,"The Naked Gun is one of the Zucker Brothers' more entertaining films, and one of the better spoofs of crime/action films out there. Like their masterpiece ""Airplane"", this film includes Leslie Neilsen (as detective Frank Drebben) as well as an odd assortment of actors and celebrities from B-films and the sports world, this time including Priscilla Presley, George Kennedy, Ricardo Montalban, and O.J. Simpson among others. You could almost spend the whole film just watching for celebrity cameos (the best of which is Reggie Jackson as a brainwashed assassin: ""must kill the queen.. must kill the queen."" Some of the jokes don't work and quite a lot of them are just stupid puns, but the physical comedy is generally well done. Presley makes a surprisingly effective ""straight man"". The jokes keep rolling in fast enough that even the ones that miss don't slow down the fun.Just by coincidence I saw the movie recently after seeing the Zucker's ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" just a few days before. So I noticed that they actually re-used one device from that film here, the botched break-in (which occurs in KFM during the extended martial arts sequence) where Neilsen goes into Montalban's character's apartment and smashes just about everything in sight (eventually starting a fire) while supposedly trying to sneak around.Not a classic film in my opinion nor am I sure it ever will be, but it's well worth a few laughs if you're in the right mood.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
53,videorama-759-859391,A very funny gun,9,4 March 2017,"Yes this is the one that kicked off that trio of infectious comedy slapstick. I actually like The Naked Gun's better than the Flying High's, only this time the brilliant Nielsen is at the helm, where he belongs. Lets face it, any film, that starts in Beirut is interesting. The great criminal here is Fantasy Island's Montalban, who has diabolic plans, ones that include brainwashing, which will aid him in assassinating the queen, where the queen really looks like the queen in this one. His captain is played by George Kennedy and like Nielsen, with being all so serious, he's created a likable character, where O.J. Simpson (yes, that's the one) plays his partner, to adequate ability (his only acting nomination is a bad one) more of a player than actor, you could say. Like the Flying High's the laughs keep coming, but here, it's at a more accelerated rate. Montage's have never been funnier, than the one you'll see here, especially, if you take pokes at Stone's Platoon, though that's kind of in bad taste. Taking pokes at Rambo would of been funnier. And this is the one, where Nielsen his eyes on the luscious Presley (God, if Elvis could see her now). She's sexy and really impresses with her character, Simpson an almost useless asset in these ones. Of course, there are those stupid moments, but that's expected in in slapstick. The brainwashing bits here, were the ones that didn't wash off. This really came at a time, we needn't something like this. It's slapstick, but it's original, smart, and fresh and garners laughs at a rate, that may'be even too quick. Excellent 89' slapstick comedy, never forgotten, and never watched once. Spawned two equally funny sequels.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
54,hellraiser7,Locked and Loaded with Hillarity,10,21 May 2021,"This is one of my favorite comedies of all time as well as parodies in the Parody subgenre of comedy. It's also another one of the best TV to movie adaptations as this film is a continuation of the show ""Police Squad"" which was a hit at the time but unfortunately had a short life span almost about the same as the TV show ""Firefly"". I honestly feel this is something most TV show should do when they don't get to go the distance, jump on another track to get there which this film did.The film is sort of an adolescent gem of mine as in my adolescence I began to explore more of the parody genre. And as a kid I have seen the TV show ""Police Squad"" which was one of my favorite comedy shows.When I saw they made a silver screen film based on that show it really blew me away, though once I rented out and saw the film I was just blown away. It was a real gut buster, I just laugh so hard watching this film that it almost hurts, that's something I rarely do for most comedy films, let alone not that many that can do that with me but thankfully this film is one of them and still is.This film is really a smoothie drink of parody as it parodies on the detective/cop shows of yesteryear, noir but also the James Bond franchise. I know that last one seems like a stretch but not as the film has some of the elements and format you would see on a Bond movie, from the very beginning, a scene with Frank goes to the crime lab and is introduced to gadgets, as well as the whole assassination plot, you name it for any Bond fan it's all there.The film is fully loaded with visual and verbal humor and hits the target on both counts. There is just so much that even on rewatch I can always find some more that might have flew by me making the film funnier than before. The dialog in the film is just hilarious, the characters have some colorful even deliciously bad lines but also some clever lines that can really catch you off guard, but what makes the dialog funny is the fact that everyone is just downright serious as if what their saying and what is going on is more or less the everyday norm.There are so many memorable scenes of hilarity, I'll just say a few of my favorites as talking about them can't do the comedy justice and I don't want to give too much away.The beginning which is to me one of the best openings in movies in general, it's always a great way to start off a film with a bang. It's a bit similar to the beginning of a Bond movie where we see a meeting held by an organization of evil much like Spectre from James Bond with some of the scummiest people in history all in one table and all up to no good as usual. This is obviously a set up for the plot of the film. But of course, in the end it results in one of my favorite battles of all time as well as the most hilarious as Frank just beats the crap out of everyone in the room, which is something most of us think of doing to scumbags all in the same room.There is a chase scene which is just hilarious and slightly thrilling with Frank being in the one car in the chase which is the last one you'd want to be in which is a Driving School car which let's just say gave the trainee driver one hell of a crash course. But what really made it even more hilarious was a death scene that could make Michael Bay envious.The final half with the Baseball game is just absolutely hilarious as not just is Frank trying to stop an assassination but also, he's lets just say making Baseball history.I really like the music which is sort of an old jazzy score which fits the film giving it an old-fashioned noir vibe to it. I really love the theme song which is one of my favorite themes of all time, just really gives you that empowering theme that the good guys are on the way to help. But also, it's one of my favorite intros as we see only the top perspective on an old squad car with the siren going and that car just seems to have a mind of it's own as it is just driving in some of the most random places let alone fit somehow, one place I like is where it parks at a doughnut shop with a dozen priced 1.99; yeah that would be a dream come true.The supporting characters and cast are solid from George Kennedy as Ed the chief who is really a solid straight man that just really helps in setting Frank straight though in the world of parody even he himself has his quarks. Ricardo Montalban whom is an honorable mention in favorite actors of mine, he's just great in the villain role as usual because it's Ricardo after all where he is suave and charismatic but also has that quiet sinisterness that simmers before it boils to the surface.But of course, what makes the film is Leslie Nelson himself one of my favorite comedic actors; this guy is practically the king of parody comedy as there's never been another since. Really love his performance because he just plays it straight from beginning to end which makes him and the film all the funnier. I really love the Frank Drebin character who is another of my honorable mention in fictional heroes.Frank is pretty much an old-fashioned cop from yesteryear but transported to our modern decade. This guy is so serious and tough that it's strange. He's really not that good at his job as he can be clumsy sometimes, a little rock headed both things inadvertently in his defense. Not quite with the times as he has sort of that attitude of a person from a different time. All these things would make him inefficient but despite the inefficiency he's does get the job done all the same if not smoothly.What make him endearing is that he how determined he is in completing his mission and just his overall never-ending crusade in fighting crime. Despite how tough things get for him (some of that inadvertently caused by himself) he keeps with it all the same. He's always does what's right no matter what and however he can because there really is no other way or any time to find a better way because it doesn't always exist, he just simply acts which makes him all the more effective in saving the day. I like also that he's a person that has some little quirks and a warmth to him, which makes him a guy you would like to be friends with though you probably want to keep your valuables away from him.This is a comedy classic that's full loaded with hilarity.Rating: 4 stars.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!

Worse is to follow though when Drebin discovers that the man responsible for the shooting is also planning on assassinating Queen Elizabeth 2 and sets to work foiling the mad man's plans in his own unique way...Sometimes even when films are made a long time ago they can still produce the laughs and the original Naked Gun film is one such example; it arguably uses the easiest approach to gain laughs (slapsticks and pratfalls) much like we used to see in the Pink Panther films, but it is mostly used to very good effect here and I have to admit that even after all these years I still found the film very very funny.One thing that I think has always made this film work so well is Leslie Nielsen; his dead-pan comic style and complete lack of awareness of all of the chaos that he is causing along the way is actually one of the things that makes what you see so funny. There's a sort of endearing innocence to Drebin (whereby the good intention is always there, but his approach leaves a lot to be desired).The plot is vague and only basically outlined, but in all honesty who really watches spoof or parody films for the plots. If you're just looking for laughs then this film has them in abundance - I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen the film, but trust me there are plenty on offer.This is Leslie Nielsen's film all the way and he really steals the show here; the likes of George Kennedy, Priscilla Presley & Ricardo Montalban are good in support, but they don't hold a candle to Nielsen. OJ Simpson didn't have much screen time in this one which wasn't much of an issue for me as I always felt that acting was never really his forte.In these grim times - particularly in the UK where we're still in our 3rd COVID-19 lockdown :-( The Naked Gun is a nice piece of escapist fun that is still capable of bringing the laughs after all these years.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!

The humour isn't quite as sophisticated as we expect it to be these days, at least not quite as clever. It's silly and slapstick, which many people can't appreciate.At the time it did it's job and it did it well and I remember it being funnier then. Don't get me wrong it still gets a good few twitters of laughter from me and I still enjoyed it, because it's not an offensive film in general and neither is it filled with Sex, Drugs, Violence, Etc, but I do wonder how many more points it would have scored back when I first watched it.Frank Drebin is back on patrol following his escapades in 'Police Squad'. What ensues is a mixture of 'James Bond' and 'Murder She Wrote'. Chaos goes everywhere with Frank and it's usually very funny, but does he solve the case in time to save the innocent?

Some of those moments still hold up and others do not. What was most surprising watching this film now is how leisurely paced it seems compared to contemporary rapid fire comedies.

I have to admit that, though I'm normally not a big fan of slapstick, many of the gags are presented very clever and show a very decent humor instead of just going for the easy laughs. Nontheless the plot remains nonsense of course and thus you shouldn't expect a great movie in terms of tension or story. On the other hand, those parts are clearly not in the focus of this title and so I think we can all live with this fact.All in all this is a great parody that still convinces with clever humor even decades after its production.

70,Beta_Gallinger,"A funny spoof, with continuous slapstick",8,25 September 2007,"The only spoof movie I saw starring Leslie Nielsen before this one was ""Spy Hard"", and like so many others, I did not care much for it. However, knowing that ""The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!"" was a lot more popular (as I'm sure you can tell by comparing the IMDb ratings), I watched it with relatively high expectations. I found virtually no laughs in ""Spy Hard"", but found many in this police spoof, which proves that the mediocrity of SH has nothing to do with Nielsen's starring role.Detective Nordberg, a member of Police Squad, is shot multiple times during an investigation, and is nearly killed! While he is in the hospital, a fellow member of Police Squad, the clumsy Lieutenant Frank Drebin, must investigate this attempted murder. While on the case, Drebin eventually finds proof that Vincent Ludwig, a local businessman, plans to have the Queen of England assassinated during her visit in L.A.! Unfortunately, Drebin accidentally burns the proof of this assassination plot (he ends up burning a lot more than that), and Ludwig is a very well-respected individual, so how will the clumsy detective convince anyone of this sinister plan?!A ton of slapstick is featured in this spoof, and as big a fan as I am of the type of humour, I have to admit that this film may overdo it a bit at times, making some of the gags a tad too predictable. Fortunately, most of the movie doesn't have this problem. In fact, the jokes are often hilarious, whether they are physical gags, or comical lines! For better or worse, there are also some tasteless gags here and there, such as in the scene early in the film where Lieutenant Frank Drebin visits Detective Nordberg in the hospital. If you're into silly spoof movies and slapstick, and are generally not irked by raunchiness and/or tastelessness, I highly recommend ""The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!"" for you!",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
71,Mister-6,In praise of Leslie Nielsen....,10,6 October 1999,"The movie itself is funny.  ""The Naked Gun"" is without a doubt the best skewering of all cop movie cliches available in this day and age.  It works on every conceivable level and a few that haven't been conceived yet.But what puts it over the top is Leslie Nielsen.It's amazing: he was great in ""Airplane!"", another classic from the ZAZ team (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker), and in the lamentably short TV series ""Police Squad!"".  But here, he spreads his wings and flies to new heights of insanity and delerium.  With jaw set square and tongue firmly in cheek, Neilsen makes the role of Lt. Frank Drebin all his own and the movie-going public's collective life is all the more enriched because of it.He's aided and abetted by greats like Kennedy, Presley and Montalban (who knew?) and the movie even finds good moments for John Houseman and Reggie Jackson.  As I said, the movie takes off and finds great things to do with police cars with a mind all their own and goes on from there to take on such cliches as car chases, illegal searches, the cleaning out of the desk, the trip to the police lab, shoot-outs, the lax housework of a single police detective, etc., etc., etc.....And what other cop movie in the history of the world has a music video in the middle, courtesy of Herman's Hermits?Just one.Ten stars and a Dugout Dog for ""The Naked Gun"", the film that answers once and for all - can Leslie Nielsen do comedy?I think you know the answer.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!

73,ivo-cobra8,"Classic comedy the best one in Naked Gun franchise, they don't make em like this anymore!",10,22 May 2016,"What can I say, this is a classic comedy of the 80's that it is the feature film adaptation of the cult TV series Police Squad!. I love this flick to death and it is my number 1 comedy. Every time I watch this action comedy flick, I keep laughing. The film features fast-paced slapstick comedy, including many visual and verbal puns and gags. The first film of The Naked Gun is the best one of the trilogy ever made, it impossible not to laugh. The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! (1988) is the feature film adaptation of the cult TV series Police Squad!. Leslie Nielsen reprises his role as the bumbling Lt. Frank Drebin. The film's cast included George Kennedy, O.J. Simpson, Priscilla Presley, and Ricardo Montalban. The film was written and directed by the same team who made the original Airplane! and two sequels would follow: The Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear and The Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult. This film is funny as hell and it is a classic I love The Naked Gun to death! They don't make comedy's like this one anymore! I want to see a comedy like is this film today. Naked Guns are actually one of my favorite trilogy of all times, I love all three movies. They are just fun harmless movies to watch on Saturday or any day you want to see them. ""Yes. Well, when I see 5 weirdos dressed in togas stabbing a guy in the middle of the park in full view of 100 people, I shoot the bastards. That's *my* policy."" Plot: Those screw-loose creators of Airplane have done it again in this police-show parody. Police Squad's own granite-jawed, rock-brained cop, Frank Drebin, bumbles across a mind-control scheme to assassinate Queen Elizabeth. Priscilla Presley, O. J. Simpson, a stuffed beaver, two baseball teams and an odd assortment of others join the wacko goings-on and blow the laugh-o-meter to smithereens. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors and writers on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models and effects. Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams David Zucker from Airplane and Top Secret! they created a beautiful comedy of all time. This was the second film in the trilogy I saw it, The Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear (1991) was the first movie I ever saw as a kid and it become my favorite film, that was before I saw this one. I love The Naked Gun 2 1/2 but this one Is my number one favorite comedy in the naked gun trilogy including genre of comedy's. This is a parody film that also combine element from Dirty Harry films. I remember watching Police Squad! as a kid I haven't seen all episodes and the show was canceled after six episodes and that was all. Someday I might going to re watch them, but still rather watch the feature film because it has so much humor in it. Specially the baseball game I am not American so I am not a baseball fab, but this film was made before Major League (1989)with Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen was made. I absolutely love the song I Love L.A. by Randy Newman. Leslie Nielsen as clumsy Frank Drebin was awesome and this was his best performance in a movie ever. You also have a lot of shootings, like Frank shoots on his car, when his own car try's to run him down he he. He chases a doctor who was hypnotized to kill Nordberg (O.J. Simpson) in the hospital you have a car chases. You have a fight scenes in the beginning of the movie which are fun, the film is very entertaining, fast paced and funny as hell. Ira Newborn did a perfect score for The Naked Gun theme. Director David Zucker did a wonderful job directing the film and the writers did a wonderful jobs. Overall I am given The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! a perfect 10 you have a beautiful cast a lot's of comedy and beautiful baseball game and a lot's of funny actions. I love this comedy flick to death. The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! is a 1988 American comedy film. The film stars Leslie Nielsen as the bumbling police lieutenant Frank Drebin.

75,ajs-10,Funny stuff from the late Leslie Nielsen...,8,5 December 2010,"If actor Leslie Nielsen hadn't sadly died on November 28th this year (2010), I maybe wouldn't have watched this. I have seen it many times before but this is the first time I've attempted a review. The trouble with reviewing the work of someone that has recently passed is that you feel you don't want to say anything bad about them. I will, however, try to keep my impartiality. Here's a short summary of the plot before I get into it (summary haters please keep an eye on that crazy baseball umpire while I write the next paragraph).Undercover policeman, Nordberg, has been shot and it's up to inept cop Frank Drebin to find who's responsible. Add to that the fact that Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is visiting the city and Drebin has his plate full. The finger of suspicion falls on respected businessman Vincent Ludwig and Frank decides to pay him a visit. There he meets Jane Spencer who has been persuaded by Ludwig to get close to Drebin so he can discover what the police know. During his investigation Drebin discovers a plot to assassinate the Queen during her visit. Can Frank find out who shot Nordberg and also stop the assassination attempt on the Queen and maybe even get the girl? So many questions, so little time.A pretty well made film with a very high gag (in the comedy sense) ratio. For me there were surprisingly few 'laugh out loud' moments though. I put it down to the difference in culture between the USA and the UK. We may speak more or less the same language, but what makes us laugh is very different. That isn't to say there were any bad performances, far from it, Leslie Nielsen was excellent as Frank Drebin, Priscilla Presley put in a stellar performance as Jane Spencer and Ricardo Montalban was excellent as Vincent Ludwig. Honourable mentions must also go to George Kennedy as Ed Hocken, O.J. Simpson as Nordberg and Nancy Marchand as the Mayor.I used to love the TV show but I'm afraid it doesn't translate too well to the big screen. It's still pretty good, but I don't think the humour comes across as well when you are bombarded with it for 80 minutes solid. So, over all, not as good as the TV show, but still recommended if only for Leslie Nielson's performance, he will be missed.My score: 7.6/10",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!

It had a great story and right on dialogue that was perfectly said by the great actor Leslie Neilsen (who was the right pick for the role of Lt. Frank Drebin as well as the costars). Gags just keep happening at the right time, nicely paced throughout the film. The best scene in the film is when Frank Drebin accidentally tops a surprised Queen Elizabeth! And Ira Newborn's great score for this film and the successive two films is inventive, adding to the laugh out riot tone. A near perfect film that is a must see for anyone who is into comedy . . . a solid 9 out of 10.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!

Though it has got some flaws and suffers from weak material sometimes, the movie is surprisingly strong and funny, especially as Nielsen's character is being probably the most stupid policeman in the whole world. And it's a classic silly-comedy, featuring dozens of silly scenes leaving no space for it to be mistaken as a serious movie.The movie makes you laugh, that's for sure, because either you will find it so silly that you have to laugh at it, or you find it amusing, and you have to laugh with it.

Visual gags come fast, and it's impossible to catch them all! From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. Heartfelt and riveting from the first frame to the last.

80,tomimt,... having your nuts bit of by a Laplander... That's the way I want it...,9,7 October 2005,"""Naked Gun"" is one of the few screw ball comedies that crack me up every time. There's something in it, that just wont age willingly, it stays fresh. Or maybe it's just my sense of humor, or the the fabulous acting of Leslie Nielsen, I laugh every time when I watch it.Leslie Nielsen plays Drebin, a detective, who spills out hard boiled inner dialogue and keeps his stone cut expression no matter what. He fights crime to the last. And with Drebin the crime wont last: it churns up into a chaos. Priscilla Presly is Jane Specner, a secretary of Vincent Ludwig (Ricardo Montalban) the bad guy of the film. Jane also is the la fem fetal whom Drebin falls head over heels. There is a plot about assassination of Queen Elizabeht II, but as this type of comedy works, the over all plot is pretty meaningless. And that's okay, at least for me: It's the humor that counts in this type of movies.David Zukcer has managed to milk everything from the movie, it is as funny as it could be. I can't see any way to improved the film, it has gags for everyone, be them fast sight gags or verbal juggling, or even slap stick comedy. The bests scenes are, when someone is doing something seemingly important while Drebin or some else goofs up in the background, leading up in sheer stupidity and situations so absurd, that you just cannot help but to laugh",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!

Now occasionally in a real world setting you will get a couple of dumb-asses but if the world was like this it would have exploded already. Leslie Nielsen's character seems like a rip-off of Mr Magoo, at least Magoo was original.I just don't think I will ever get this style of comedy.

82,movieguy1021,The Naked Gun: 8/10,8,10 October 2002,"From the goofs that created Airplane! and Rat Race (David Zucker, Jim Abrahams, Jerry Zucker), here comes The Naked Gun, based on their short-lived TV series (Police Squad!).Leslie Nielsen is dunderheaded Lieutenant Frank Drebin, who is part of L.A.'s Police Squad. He's been their for awhile, but isn't the sanest person in the sanitarium. When the Police Squad is called on to protect the Queen of England on her visit to America, Frank is the main man. Along the way, he meets someone who may be in a plot to assassinate her.This may look like a plotless comedy, and it somewhat is. Just like Airplane!, it manages to have lots of sketches while still in the plot (unlike Austin Powers, for instance). Like the scene in Ludwig's office when Frank, let's say, changes it's decor. Nielsen is like his other films-the type of character who doesn't think he's funny but he is. Some jokes are tasteless (like the statues), but some are full of taste. Well, now that I think about it, there weren't many tastefull jokes, but The Naked Gun still made me laugh.There weren't as many funny parts as Airplane! (which was one huge laugh), but some scenes were side-splitting. The ending momentum slowed down some at the baseball game finale, and his checking the players got old after awhile. It was just in to stretch the running time to 85 minutes (which was a perfect length, by the way). Besides what I did, there's not much more to say about it except it's really funny and recommended.My rating: 8/10Rated PG-13 for sex-related humor.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!

The girl I was dating at the time chose it, and so we went. I never laughed so hard. The poster alone will let you know exactly what you are in for, and this first movie of the Naked Gun Series doesn't disappoint.Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) of Police Squad as been called in to investigate an attempt on his partner's life, and what he stumbles into is a conspiracy to assassinate Queen Elizabeth, who is touring America. Frank teams up with the secretary of his chief suspect, and what follows is a series of hijinks and mishaps that had most of us rolling in the aisles with laughter. Frank gets into hot water with the mayor, so he must beat the clock to foil the assassination attempt, win the girl, and secure his place back on the police force.I think part of what made this movie such a hit with me was that I went in blind, not really knowing what I was in for. There was no built up anticipation or hopes, just a young couple going to watch a funny movie. It is your classic inept detective comedy in the vein of other classics such as the Pink Panther and the Police Academy movies, and others that would follow like ""Who's Harry Crumb?"" and ""The Other Guys"". The blue print works as long as the movie and the acting is done well, and ""The Naked Gun"" certainly did that.I highly recommend this film to any comedy enthusiast. If you haven't seen this one yet, I know you would enjoy it. The cast does feature O.J. Simpson before his trial, but if that doesn't bother you, then you should give it a go. This is a classic now, and all these years later, I will still watch it from time to time and laugh just as much as the first time I saw it. 8 stars out of 10.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!

The first one is still the best, but ""Naked Gun 2 1/2"" and ""Naked Gun 33 1/3"" were very funny too. That's why ""The Naked Gun"" series is the funniest movie series ever made.

""The Naked Gun"" comes from the ancestory.com chart first hinted at by ""The Kentucky Fried Movie (1977),""most readily identified by the mighty ""Airplane!

In it, a bumbling detective uncovers a plot made by a big business man to murder the Queen of England at the World Series with a device that can control people's minds. It is a completely absurd comedy the likes of Airplane!, and anybody with a taste for hilarious parody will enjoy it.The plot of the movie is pretty good. It is mainly a spoof of detective movies from the 50s, what with the confident detective who narrates and speaks in the macho tone. Unfortunately, this detective is so clueless that everything he does is a major screw up. The humour in this movie isn't really intelligent humour. It's stupid humour that is so ridiculous it's funny. I can't really think of much else to say besides this movie is hilarious. It features one of my favourite kinds of humour, and that's word gags. Most of the jokes come from the way people speak to each other rather than visually.Leslie Nielsen is a great comedian, and this movie is no exception.

Also on his plate is discovering what happened to his closest friend Nordberg(O.J Simpson, before he did you know what), who was shot at repeatedly on a drugs investigation. Drebin soon discovers there's a link between the visit and the attempt on Nordberg's life and sets about catching a would be assassin before they get to the Queen.From the same writers of the original ""Flying High"", there is some comedy gold in here. While some of it has aged, there's plenty of good stuff in there still.

Case in Point, The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!, which is one of the most outrageous, side splittingly hilarious comedies ever made.Neilson is perfectly cast as LAPD Lieutenant Frank Drebin, who surely must be related to the legendary inspector Clouseau. After socking it to America's enemies in the utterly ridiculous pre-title sequence, Drebin must save Queen Elizabeth II from an assassination plot at the hands of the dastardly Vincent Ludwig (Ricardo Montalbon). This would prove impossible for the spectacularly incompetent detective if not for one small fact: everyone else in this movie is nearly as clueless as he is. Rarely does a movie combine as many comedic devices, or use them to such effect, as this film. Naked Gun joins together the slapstick of Keaton, the manic energy and one-liners of the Marx Brothers, and the sheer ridiculousness of Monty Python, then dials them up in a way that only the Zuckers can manage. The slapstick sequences build and build, linking together one mishap after another in a way that defies all logic. Their dialog utilizes a one of a kind mixture of double entendre, mixed metaphors, monologues, and self-negating sentences that produce some of the most quotable lines in cinema. Speaking of quotes, watch for delicious parodies of some of the best known lines from famous cop dramas.And before the movie ends, they manage to skewer practically every cliché known to the cop genre. The shootouts, the chases, the interrogations, the tearful meeting with the partner's wife, it's all here. They even managed to spoof the opening credits of practically every cop movie ever made. And no-one understands the comedic power of overstatement more than they do. Their car chases don't end in a massive fireball, they end in three. When they introduce the requisite romantic subplot, they take you through every possible variation of the semi-obligatory lyrical interlude. And when the hero's heartfelt statement of true love comes, it's so moving that it ends the Arab/ Israeli feud. While they were at it, the Zuckers also managed to spoof the Bond franchise, and to include possibly the best sports scene in any non-sports movie. It may not be subtle, or entirely tasteful, or contain any twists that a third grader couldn't predict, but Naked Gun is just about the most fun you can have at the movies. There is not a single moment that passes without a gag, and you'll be laughing so hard you'll hardly have time to breath.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!

99,dobbin-4,The Naked Gun is Leslie Neilsons 2nd best comedy.,9,13 July 2007,The Naked Gun is an hilarious Spoof/Comedy that should go down as the second best Leslie Neilsons comedy(only surpassed by The Naked Gun 2). It is about Lietenent Frank Drebin(Leslie Nielson) and after his best friend and partner gets shot down Frank goes for revenge. The movie is good for many reasons 1. Its spoofs are funny and original as well as its jokes 2. The jokes are always persistent and 3. It starts with laughs and ends with laughs. Overall I think this movie is definitely one of Leslie Neilsons finest comedy's and the movie itself is hilarious. So I rate this movie 94% and if you missed this one somehow you should definitely go out and rent it right now.,The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
100,InjunNose,Hilarious film that's more clever than some people realize,8,19 December 2009,"It's difficult to review a comedy, which is why I haven't attempted it until now. (What do you say, after all? ""This is a really, really funny movie!"") The great thing about ""The Naked Gun"" is that, in addition to being genuinely funny, it's a smart little film. Perfect example: Raymond Chandler fans will get a kick out of the reference to ""Farewell, My Lovely"". Upon his first meeting with Priscilla Presley's character, Leslie Nielsen (as Lt. Frank Drebin) notes in the voice-over, ""She was giving me a look I could feel in my hip pocket."" This line is lifted directly from Chandler's novel, but it's so subtle and fits into the film so well that viewers who know nothing of Chandler won't feel left out. This, along with Nielsen's lovably goofy performance, is what separates the work of the Zucker brothers from knockoffs like ""Loaded Weapon"". Sure, you've seen ""The Naked Gun"" already...but see it again and you'll pick up on things you didn't notice the first time. (Single best moment of the film: O.J. Simpson's absurdly prolonged reaction to being shot by Ricardo Montalban's goons. It sends me into fits of laughter every time!)",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
101,ThomasColquith,Average Spoof,5,21 July 2021,"Just watched ""Naked Gun"" for the first time ever and while I enjoyed it, I am slightly disappointed. Not the comedy classic I expected it to be, rather just more of an average spoof/comedy, which at 1.5 hours still feels long. The baseball scene at the end felt anticlimactic and too drawn out, though there were some good lines and gags interspersed throughout; however the plot was just too minimalist, I expected a little more substance even from a spoof. So, 5/10 rating.** Update: I watched the sequel Naked Gun 2.5 and liked it much better, giving it a 9/10. But the third film in the series I liked less than the first and gave it a 4/10. So in my view, just watch the second one (Naked Gun 2.5) it is hilarious, the other two are just ok.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!

And even though i don't laugh as much as I did the first times, I still have no problem putting this movie at the all-time top of comedies. The beginning of it, with all the dictators, is especially well-made. My salute to the people who came ut with the idea of that one. Leslie Nielsen is simply the king of comedies, especially slapstick-comedies like this one. Movies like this one are so crazy that there aren't even a tiny little serious microsecond in the whole movie, and that's one of the reasons it's so great. It's just totally crazy. This movie will never get too old. Humour and laughter is indeed timeless.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
103,ryan_kuhn,Featuring OJ Simpson In His First Dramatic Role,9,13 February 2005,"There are movies that are a series of sketches put together on the strength of a simple plot. The Naked Gun is one of those movies. The plot? Terrorists want to assassinate the Queen of England while she's visiting Los Angeles. The sketches? They all work. Ingredients for a wonderful movie, all met by the zany Zucker brothers, who also produced the Airplane! movies in the early 1980s. Based on the cult TV show Police Squad!, in which only 6 episodes were made, The Naked Gun follows Officer Frank Drebin (Leslie Neilson) around LA while he does what he does. What he actually does is difficult to explain, but he does it all well enough to be the hero by the end of the movie. Among the sketches in the movie is perhaps my favorite series of events, when the Queen visits a baseball game. Why the Queen of England visits Dodger Stadium to watch the big Seattle Mariners-California Angels game, that's anyone's guess. But between the 7 announcers at the beginning of the game, to Enrico Palazzo singing the national anthem to the umpire frisking all of the players during the game, it is my favorite 20 minute stretch of any movie. Hilarious! The rest of the movie is filled with wonderful moments of comedy, never taking itself too seriously. The film also boasts OJ Simpson in his first dramatic role, and he does well playing a beat up, almost dead guy. He played the part well, wonder what ever happened to that up-and-coming actor?",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
104,Vimacone,Zany Crime Drama Comedy,7,10 May 2018,"The Police Squad series seemed like a very promising sitcom in conception. It is very unfortunate that it did not go beyond six episodes. At least it was revived as a feature film.Compared to AIRPLANE and TOP SECRET, this Zucker/Abrams collaboration has more nuanced zaniness. The sight gags, while still outrageous, seem very natural and subtle. They're not as in your face as the ones in AIRPLANE. The film carries the tone of a typical police drama of the day; so there is still room for romance and sentimentality while not straying far from the comedy.This makes it the best Zucker/Abrams comedy. I wonder what their comic influences were.This has always been nostalgia for me.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!

I don't even know where to start. If I was to list every funny thing from this film here, I would be writing a review 10 pages long. I'd be writing a book! And almost everyone on earth who hasn't been on Mars since 1989 most likely has almost every joke in this movie memorized by now. Just about everybody who will read this review will already know every joke. But I'll still name three out of my fifty favorite jokes here. One: Leslie starting to make a speech and the way he started his speech when everyone was actually there to see Weird Al Yankavits. Two: Leslie forgetting to take off his microphone at city hall when going to the mens room. Three: the whole scene at Ludwig's apartment from accidentally setting it on fire straight through to the concrete statues joke. Also, Ludwig was played by Riccardo Montablan for those who've recognized him from the love interest in a couple of Esther Williams' films. The Marx brothers were the best and funniest films of Hollywood's golden age. And Naked gun, Top secret, and Airplane are the best, funniest movies from the more modern times. Rest in peace Leslie Nielson. You HAVE made difference.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!

109,cosmorados,It was easy my dear. You forget I spent two years as a building contractor.,7,3 July 2008,"Frank Drebin is a cop on the trail of the world's worst terrorists and after a major successful operation returns to the United States, only to be upstaged by Weird Al Yankovic! This is the madcap world that Frank Drebin inhabits, a world where scientists find the ultimate deterrent for Graffiti artists, where a cop can fall into a birthday cake and a mantrap and both can be as bad as the other and a place where you take a risk when you cross a street or stick your face in a fan.However, when it comes to danger it's nothing compared to the attempted assassination of Queen Elizabeth during her forthcoming state visit. As Drebin's investigations continue he begins to suspect that respected industrialist Vincent Ludwig is connected to the plot and, against his superior's wishes he undertakes a lone crusade in order to prove his point.This is the best of the naked gun films and Leslie Neilsen's delivery is free from the over the top looks that so mark out his later turns in the role of Drebin, and the script unlike, the second film contains fewer references from the Police Squad series, with many good gags and memorable moments. As such this makes for an entertaining slice of hokum that leaves one with a smile of your face when you stop watching it.While it's not as good as the immense ""Airplane"" it is still worthy of a watch and very entertaining.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!

Drawing me towards the link that allowed me to add my own comment. I tried to resist. After all, I loved the rapid-fire jokes, hilarious one-liners, and deadpan acting no more than anyone else. I had absolutely nothing new to say about ""The Naked Gun."" But this force was drawing me forward. I felt myself being sucked in. Finally, I surrendered in reckless abandonment and decided, oh, fine, I'd write a superfluous comment that, once again, recommends this movie, even though I had nothing new to say about it. As if I had some kind of obligation to comment about movies I liked a lot. If I don't have anything new to say, then I have no obligation! Or do I? Anyway, this movie is very very funny and highly recommended. (shudder)",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
111,boyinflares,A good 80's comedy,7,18 November 2006,"Leslie Nielsen heads a talented cast in the first ""Naked Gun"" film. He stars as Lt. Frank Drebin, and his bumbling pursuit of a criminal mastermind serves as the main plot in ""The Naked Gun"". Along the way he must also act as security for the Queen of England who is making a visit, which allows for more hilarious antics from one of the most funny actors in Hollywood.Nielsen is supported by a great cast including Priscilla Presley as his love interest Jane Spencer (the scene where they have ""safe sex"" is perhaps one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen in a movie), Ricardo Montalban as the villainous Vincent Ludwig, George Kennedy as Drebin's kind-hearted superior Captain Ed Hocken, and Nancy Marchand who is terrific as the dismissive Mayor Barkley.""The Naked Gun"" is not just a straight-comedy, there are literally countless spoofs littered throughout the film, as well as plenty of remarks on society. Aside from the ""safe sex"" scene other highly amusing scenes include Drebin and a learner driver, O.J. Simpsons blundered attack on some crooks, and Drebin destroying a valuable collection of artwork and statues.The main problem with the film though is that it seems to have aged. Several of the social context related jokes and themes seem lost in today's society, but were no doubt effective in their time. Being only 4 years old when the film was originally released it is a bit hard to remember though. Overall, an entertaining and enjoyable film.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
112,guyfromjerzee,The best of the bunch!,8,4 August 2004,"This is exactly how to do a parody! Over the years, there have been many imitations, but few can match the sharp wit and pitch-perfect delivery of David Zucker and the rest of the team of writers (Jim Abrahams, Jerry Zucker and Pat Proft). The film is filled with hilarious gags that aspiring comedy writers and directors can learn from. This is not a hit-or-miss comedy. Either the jokes are funny or hilarious. There are very few bad apples in this bunch. First of all, the casting of Leslie Nielsen was genius. It's a shame that we don't see much of him anymore. His timing and delivery are impeccable. Nielsen started out as a serious actor, which I think makes his performance even funnier. If Zucker were to cast a Jim Carrey type in the role, he would try too hard to milk out the comedy in each scene. What makes Nielsen so funny is that he doesn't seem like he's trying to be funny, and as I say time and time again that's how you're supposed to do comedy! It must be done with a straight face! My favorite gag is the one in which Nielsen hangs off the ledge of a building and grabs onto a statue's penis to stop himself from falling down. That scene had me laughing so hard that I was running out of breath! I literally laughed for about 5 minutes straight! Yes, it's that funny! I like the sequels, but the original ""Naked Gun"" is the best of the bunch. A must-see for comedy fans!",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
113,Mr. Pulse,Timeless hilarity,10,17 December 2001,"The Naked Gun came out when I was only eight years old, and way too young to appreciate a lot of its jokes.  Still, there was enough low-brow and physical comedy to crack me up, and it was one of my early favorite movies. And while I've outgrown a lot of stuff I liked at that age, I can still watch The Naked Gun and laugh, and I even get the jokes that went way over my head as a young'un.The film, subtitled From The Files of Police Squad!, couldn't be simpler, and that's the way they want it.  Lt. Frank Drebin has to to clear the name of his partner Norberg (The now ironic OJ Simpson) while protecting the life of Queen Elisabeth, in Los Angeles on a tour of America.  For ninety minutes, the movie exploits, and frequently ignores, the plot in the name of jokes.  Just plain and simple, this movie is out to make you laugh, and it will sink to any depth to get there.  Everyone has their favorite Naked Gun moment; mine has to be Leslie Nielsen performing the worst rendition of the Star Spangled Banner in history.  His fireside monologue about a lost love who played the harp is priceless as well.Kudos also to Ricardo Montalban's  performance as real estate tycoon Vincent Ludwig.  So ridiculous is his accent and accentuations that he makes even straight lines funny.  I'll never get tired of him saying to a frightened Priscilla Presley, ""It was easy my dear!  You forget I spent two years as a building contractor!""  Stupidty at its funniest.This is not a classic, and it didn't change the face of comedy (It is after all, a simple application of the ""Airplane!"" formula to cop movies), but The Naked Gun is funny, and it never loses its charm no matter how many times you watch it.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!

This film is the jewel atop the crown of comedy, this film beats everything into the dust. Forget Airplane, Hot Shots, Scary Movie, this film is the spoof king! First there is the great cast with Leslie Nielson playing the dumb but straight role,George Kennedy provides good laughs as Franks buddy Ed, and I must say I enjoyed O.J Simpson as Nordberg. Then there's the phenomenal script, which starts out with Drebin kicking the crap out of terrorist to Nordberg being shot, burned, caked, toasted, bitten, and stabbed on a ship, but the big plot fills in with the attempt of assassinating the Queen of England (Reggie Jackson makes a cameo here)But the dumb jokes and one liners is the icing on this cake. Examples: ""Everything will be alright Mrs. Nordberg, your husband will be fine."" ""Unless he turns into a mindless vegetable."" Drebin being hit with a pillow and he screams as though it's alive. ""Don't worry Mrs. Nordberg, nothing will stop me from solving this crime. There is no time to waste! Now lets go get a bite to eat."" The whole student driver sequence, the love video with Frank and his girlfriend, and the villain giving a demonstration with the Queens death with his secretary. Examples over.

Later in the movie the laughs are not as frequent.My favorite scene is the one where the air bag of frank Drebin's car deploys as he parks his car. He does not realize that his car keeps rolling directly behind. When the car passes him he pulls out his badge and orders the driver less car to stop. He does not realize that the car has no driver so when the car does not stop he shots it. And it catches on fire while still rolling. That scene made me laugh so hard.

120,TimBoHannon,An Absolute Success from the ZAZ comedy team.,10,3 April 2008,"The writing team of David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker became a famous success after ""Airplane!"" made nearly 24 times its budget. Although ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" exceeded its own 33 times, it was their second film that gripped the attention of the critics and the public alike. They parlayed its success into the six episode show ""Police Squad."" After ""Top Secret!,"" they went back to their short-lived television show and made the first of three ""Naked Gun"" films. Bringing back the show's star Leslie Nielsen and their signature machine gun paced humor, they crafted their finest work.Why did I spend 100 words, giving the background to this movie? The answer is that there is not much else to say without spoiling the hilarious content. I grew up on Abbott and Costello, Laurel and Hardy, and the Three Stooges; the first two are legendary and the third has a fiercely loyal following to this day. It has been difficult ever since for a comedy to impress me. There are only two comedies I have given a vote of ten stars. ""The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!"" is even better than ""Spaceballs.""Inept Lt. Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) of Police Squad returns from abroad to the news that his partner (O.J. Simpson, when he was still funny) has been shot. We see it happen in the first of many sequences where we think the joke is over and then see it go on and on using wildly out-of-place props. Meanwhile, Vincent Ludwig (Ricardo Montalban), one of the most respected citizens in Los Angeles, has concocted an elaborate scheme to assassinate the visiting Queen of England! Thankfully, Lt. Drebin's boss (Oscar winner George Kennedy) and the rest of Police Squad have been assigned to protect her. That means Drebin must cross horns with Ludwig to prevent international disaster from culminatingat a Major League Baseball game! I am a *huge* baseball fan, and the climax is the most sensationally funny scene I have ever watched. I even saw my hometown team, although Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker clearly had no idea how bad the Seattle Mariners were at the time. They do prove that you don't have to know baseball to make it into the Television Booth.From an acting standpoint, ""The Naked Gun"" is about as good as it gets. Comedy is an entirely different discipline than dramatic acting. That is why you hear about certain actors simply as ""comedians."" Some critics and acting teachers believe comedy is harder. Nielsen is the king of treating outrageous scripts like they are ""The Ten Commandments."" He has been in many bad comedies, but with the right script, few are better at making even the best jokes funnier than they already are.Also notable is Ricardo Montalban. He publicly mentioned that he took the part for money to buy a new Chrysler. I immediately thought of Sean Connery upon reading this. After ""Thunderball,"" Connery grew uninterested in playing James Bond, possibly from the strain of four films in four years plus the deplorable Japanese media's behavior during the shooting of ""You Only Live Twice."" In both that film and the later ""Diamonds Are Forever,"" a role he only took for the cash, his boredom is unmasked in the two worst lead performances of the series.Such is not the case with Montalban. His facial expressions during the seventh inning stretch of the baseball game and his conversation with a terrorist whose name I would never wish on anybody look like they come from a man enjoying the part. The ability to keep external factors off the screen or stage is one of the fundamental cores of acting that has been lost on many talented thespians through the years. Montalban is not one of them. Other actors should take notice.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
121,andrewburgereviews,Pure comedy,8,18 March 2021,"In order to properly criticize David Zucker's ""The Naked Gun"" you must first understand that picking on the hastily written superficial plot would be missing the point. The plot can be whatever it wants to be. This movie is about sticking as many slapstick set-pieces as humanly possible in every single frame and every single moment. It's live-action Looney Tunes.But still, what is it about? Well, it's about the incompetent and delusional police Detective Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) who must foil an attempt to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II. Take a time to absorb the last half of that sentence and get used to it. Sudden escalations are this movie's bread and butter. They also add up to making this one of the funniest movies ever made. And it should be, considering how much it defies any notion of continuity or just plain sense! The humor is everywhere--both up front and center represented by Debrin's cartoon-level ridiculous misadventures and in the background hidden as easy to miss Easter eggs. I am sure that on my only viewing of this I've missed some things.Timing is everything when it comes to comedy, but director David Zucker--who also contributed to the writing--takes his fellow writers Jim Abrams and Jerry Zucker and refurbish their ""Police Squad"" television series into sustained humor. Every bit of it is as ridiculous as it is funny. Take the scene in which Drebin forgets to apply the hand-brake to his car which then starts running off on its own and literally blows up. Such incompetence would have him kicked off from the force, but here, it's treated like it's not out of the ordinary and the show goes on. The pace is relentless, its supposedly serious noir, only being present because stuff happens to go on at night sometimes and its dialogue punchy, unforgiving with a generous quantity of dry but smart PG-13 humor.Yet with comedy putting itself on the pedestal of political responsibility, there is a genuine question of social innuendos and commentary. I am delighted to say there is none. While at first I found the way the movie it's bullying the Queen a supposed joke brought on by the opposing political views of the US and its UK buddy with which it has well-known history, the ending took place at a baseball game--a religion in the US, and it was as cruel to it as it was to the Queen itself. This is Zucker making it clear that the movie will harass anything for fun, including numerous terrorist leaders/organizations--pure comedy.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!

But, it is brilliant.  Leslie Neilsen is hilarious in his incompetence as a police officer and his complete oblivious reactions to the chaos he has caused. The subtle jokes in the background are many and the most hilarious of all. You have to pay close attention when you watch this movie, or you will miss a lot of the punchlines.

The jokes are simple but great and Leslie Neilsen is fantastic as Frank Drebin, the forgetful and incompetent member of the L.A. Police Squad. He's trying to track down and reveal a drug-smuggling and assassin ring that is currently trying to assassinate the queen of England on her visit to L.A.  The results are hilarious.  This movie is a must see for comedy and has many small jokes hidden in the background.  And also, it has the funniest opening sequence of any comedy I know.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!

(1980) as Doctor 'Don't call me Surely' Rumack and has appeared in Spoofs of varying quality ever since, but this along with it's two sequels are his best.LT Drebin and his cop buddies Capt.Ed Hocken (George Kennedy) & Det.Norberg (O.J Simpson) try to foil an assassination of Queen Elizabeth (lookalike Jeannette Charles - Who has played her in various productions) by respected Businessman Vincent Ludwig (The now late Ricardo Montalban who died a couple of days ago)along for the fun ride is also Jane Spencer (Pricilla Presley - While despite not being the best actress in the world is actually surprisingly good) who appears as Ludwig's secretary and later Drebin's Love Interest.The gags are almost non-stop and are incredibly funny even after watching this film as many times as I have, The Zucker Brothers along with Abrahams and Proft are on top form here...It's sooooo Much better than the hit and miss Scary Movie's 3 & 4, Wrongfully accused or Mr Magoo.Leave your brain at the door and enjoy****1/2 out of *****The Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear **** / ***** The Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult ***1/2 / *****",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
125,ADOZER200,By Far One of the Most Funniest Movies,9,8 May 2002,I probably have seen this movie thousands of times and i have always laughed harder each time. This movie is a spoof with alot of laughter plus a fairly good plot to such a ridiculous movie. Leslie Neilson cant do anything else other than spoofs. Its hard to take him serious in some of his older roles. Ive seen funny spoofy movies but this one next to spaceballs is the funniest spoof ive ever seen. There are many movie i feel shouldnt even be at the top where this one should always be.,The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
126,ajaws4ever,It is physically impossible to not fall down on the floor while laughing your head off!,10,17 October 2006,"Holy crap! This is the best comedy ever made! Even the sequels (The Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear -- The Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult) are just as funny and good! This movie stars the funniest man on the planet (next to Jim Carrey and Billy Bob Thornton) which is Leslie Neilsen (Spy Hard, Scary Movie 4)! This movie also stars other hilarious actors and actresses...such as Priscilla Presley (TV's Breakfast with Einstein, HBO's Tales from the Crypt), Ricardo Montalban (Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over, Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan), George Kennedy (Airport '77, Creepshow 2), and O.J. Simpson (The Towering Inferno, Firepower) in this TOTALLY HILARIOUS movie.The funny parts are so imaginative and creative and belly-laugh-bringers. Leslie Nielsen plays Lt. Frank Drebin character so well. Everyone plays their character so well! Oh my, God, this movie is so hilarious! I know I've said that like three times now, but it's true! Even goth people who never laugh and are obsessed with death and blood will laugh at this movie if they at least give the movie a try. I'm serious, I used to be a horror movie fan (but I wasn't goth, though), but when I decided to try this movie out (it's a comedy by the way...oh, wait, you already know that), and I LOVED IT! I literally watched it at least a hundred times. And I'm only 12 years old! I watched it once everyday last year in a hundred days! And I still watch it, but I lost count now! I love this movie! I also watch its sequels. They're also the best of the best of the best of the comedy genre. If you choose to watch this movie, YOU ROCK! You have a pure, good soul. If you choose to NOT watch this movie, then you need a good psychiatrist because you DO NOT know what you are missing. You only need a psychiatrist if you don't watch it AFTER you read this comment. If you haven't seen it before because you haven't heard of it before, then that's okay.WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT? BACK TO THE MOVIE! Leslie Neilsen is definitely talented and God gave him a rare and special gift that one-in-a-billion people have. Leslie is so funny and good-hearted. Oh, and so what if he has a girl name? That doesn't make him weird. He's hilarious and he's a very gifted actor that brings belly-laughs in every single movie and TV show he has been in (all 223 of them, he'll be starring in three more movies, two in 2007, which are Music Within and Lipshitz Saves the World...and one in 2008, which is Scary Movie 5!!!) Anyway, this movie is for almost all ages (11 or older) I'd have to say because there is a lot of strong off-color humor and some border-line strong sexuality (but mostly sexual humor) and is not for younger children.See this movie! You won't regret it! **** out of **** 10 out of 10 stars My MPAA rating: PG-13: Off-Color Humor, Sexual Content and Dialogue, and for Some Language",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
127,kylopod,What we can learn from this film,9,19 October 2005,"The real question that ""The Naked Gun"" poses is not why it's one of the funniest spoofs ever made, but why virtually no subsequent movie in this genre has been any good at all. I used to adore this sort of movie when I was a kid--""Airplane,"" ""Top Secret,"" and the six-episode ""Police Squad"" show, which became the basis for the ""Naked Gun"" series, were among the funniest films I knew. When I first saw ""The Naked Gun"" in the theater when I was eleven, I was in uncontrollable laughter for the first few minutes. That was my standard of great humor at the time.But the following decades gave us a variety of similar spoof films, some of which involved one or more of the Zucker-Abrams-Nielsen team, and none of these films were even remotely in the league of their predecessors. These included ""Hot Shots,"" ""Loaded Weapon 1,"" ""Jane Austen's Mafia,"" ""Spy Hard,"" ""Wrongfully Accused,"" and ""Scary Movie."" These films would typically feature some funny stuff, but you'd walk away indifferently, wondering what the overall point was. Seeing a ponytailed Leslie Nielsen imitating John Travolta's dance sequence in ""Pulp Fiction"" is funny for a second, but there's nothing enduring about such humor. An entire movie filled with such scenes doesn't amount to much. What's the big deal about such jokes, anyway? There's nothing intrinsically funny about making references to other films, even if you do it in a silly way. At what point did the genre go wrong and become such a dreary, uninspired affair? Is it that I've just outgrown this sort of humor?I have another theory. When I first watched ""The Naked Gun"" at age eleven, I had not seen many of the movies it was spoofing, such as the early James Bond pictures. I was vaguely familiar with some of the clichés it was making fun of, but many of the political and sexual jokes went right over my head. And the celebrity cameos meant nothing to me. So what was it about the film that appealed to me so much, that made me laugh till my sides hurt?The answer is simple: it was the film's utter silliness. Think of the scene at the beginning when we discover that Ayatollah Khomeini secretly sports a mohawk underneath his turban. Or the opening credits where the police car goes on the sidewalk, inside buildings, on a roller coaster, and so on. None of this makes any sense, of course; it's just an exercise in pure absurdity. I loved ""The Naked Gun"" for pretty much the same reason I loved the Three Stooges or Bugs Bunny cartoons. Even as an adult, I appreciate unsubtle cartoon humor when it is handled effectively. As long as it makes me laugh, who cares that it's not ""sophisticated""? For example, the scene where Lt. Drebin breaks into a building and tries to be as quiet as possible, but then inadvertently sets off a player piano, is masterfully filmed.Thus, ""The Naked Gun"" is farce as much as it is satire. As I grew older, I would gain a greater appreciation for the one-liners, like ""You take a chance getting up in the morning, crossing the street or sticking your face in a fan."" To be sure, many of these jokes are dumb. They're supposed to be. That's the whole point. What I understood even at age eleven was that the movie was essentially playing games with the audience. When Lt. Drebin looks in a drawer and says ""bingo,"" I knew immediately that the drawer would reveal a bingo board. I was used to this sort of humor, because I'd seen it in the earlier Zucker-Abrams films, where the jokes had a definite logic to them, and trying to predict them in advance was part of the fun. They have far more to do with audience anticipation than with trying to make us laugh at bad puns.The modern spoof films have forgotten all this. They've forgotten that making a good spoof requires a measure of invention, even if much of the plot is ripped off from elsewhere. Car chases may not be original, but ""The Naked Gun"" is, as far as I know, the first film in which the chase is conducted by a student driver. This type of cleverness is largely absent from the modern spoofs, which assume that they have no reason to be creative when their ideas are based broadly on other films. They've forgotten that the most effective way to make fun of a cliché is by coming up with an ingenious twist. Even the characters in films like these matter, and Lt. Drebin is crafted in the grand tradition of other inept lawmen like Inspector Clousseau. This is what gives the film its own personal stamp that makes it more than an exercise in movie references.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!

It's making fun of everyone involved in every possible and overtime it gets more and more redicilous in a good way because you can never predict how just a simple conversation will play out and usually it plays out absurd but everyone is acting like it's normal and it just works.It's a classic comedy from the 1980s with the geniune 80s feel and look with it's soundtrack, effets, people and just everything. It's a time capsule of everything great from that decade put together in one comedic movie.Leslie is just brillant and watching this movie now as an adult it brings back memories from childhood and I love it. You can also see O.J. Simpson acting few years before his incident.If you love classic comedy this is one of the must watch movies it's

131,jaysilentbob37,Leslie Neilsen is a comedic genius.,10,21 February 2006,"This is another movie from the creators of the ever hysterical Airplane. If you've seen Airplane, than you can expect the same kind of humor from this. This is one of those movies in which you can go crazy by trying to count the gags in the first ten minutes. Airplane did disaster films, this one does police dramas.Frank Drebin (Leslie Neilsen) is a respected cop with gravel for a brain. He is part of a police force called Police Squad, who the security of Queen Elizabeth has just been handed to for her visit to Los Angeles. Frank bumbles through several hilarious scenarios in trying to foil an assassination attempt on her, and catch the attempted murderer of his best friend Nordberg (OJ Simpson). Meanwhile, he starts going out with the beautiful Jane Spencer (Priscilla Presley).This movie goes from one hilarious situation to another, from commandeering a car that's being used for a drivers test, to trying to save a valuable pen from a fish tank. Leslie Neilsen's comedic timing is brilliant. His facial expressions during the slapstick sequences are priceless, as are his dead-seriousness of delivering one liners. Some of his quotes are so hilarious, that I have trouble figuring out how he could have possibly kept a straight face during filming. This is another classic in the same style as Airplane, which means hilarity. This gets a 9/10.It is rated PG-13 for Crude and Sexual Humor, and for Some Language.

132,Listen_to_the_Law,Hilarious movie spoof from genius director Zucker,9,2 September 2007,"There would be no Scary Movie's had it not been for Naked Gun. The movie that started the unofficial spoof genre is by far a classic when it comes to comedy movies. And all of that can be traced to one man: Lieutenant Frank Dreblin (Nielsen).I feel I should spend more time talking about Nielsen's character Dreblin: he is the perfect character for a comedy movie: dumbly smart, arrogant, and hilarious. The facial expressions are priceless; you can't describe this type of humor. You simply have to experience it.True hilarity comes from Naked Gun: it has that clever humor where you know the writers and actors aren't overdoing it. While not all of the jokes were perfect, none of them were annoying. Now how many comedies can claim that? Naked Gun is the perfect example of humor that I love. I mean it when I say this: you have got to watch this movie!",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
133,the-jerk,Look! It's Enrico Pullazo!,10,15 June 2005,"If ""Airplane!"" was the movie that proved how funny ""Forbidden Planet"" star Leslie Nielsen can be (and he can be a riot with the right material), ""Naked Gun"" was the movie that cemented his reputation in this regard, for better or worse.Nielsen plays Lt. Frank Drebbin, a seemingly incompetent cop who manages to nonetheless to get the job done. In the beginning of the movie, he busts a meeting filled with ""evil"" world leaders including Idi Amin, the Ayatollah Khomeini, and Gorbachev (""I knew it!"" Drebbin yells as he rubs off the mark on Gorbachev's forehead). But when he suspects that a shady character named Vincent Ludwig (Ricardo Montalban from ""Fantasy Island"") is plotting to kill Queen Elizabeth, nobody except his captain, Ed Hocken (played by another serious actor who shows a great ability with comedy, George Kennedy) is willing to take him seriously. His retractors include the mayor (played by Nancy Marchand, later of ""The Sopranos""), who after a series of pratfalls that make Drebbin look like an idiot (it's not hard) takes his badge. But Drebbin is determined to prove his case, even if it means posing as opera star Enrico Pullazo and an umpire to do it, and prevent the assassination of the queen.There's a love story between Drebbin and Jane Spencer, played by Priscilla Presley, who is also not ready to accept that her boss Ludwig is a murderer, and O.J. Simpson provides support (and some of the funniest scenes in the movie) as the hapless Det. Nordberg, who can't seem to avoid getting hurt time and time again. Admit it, it's a hoot watching these scenes now and imagining that the real O.J. is the one nearly being killed.The movie was made by Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker, the team also responsible for ""Airplane!"", and is based on the cult classic TV show (cancelled before its time because, of course, it was too much for the dumb TV audiences to be able to follow) ""Police Squad!"" I think it can be easily argued that it's because of the material provided by these geniuses that Nielsen is so funny; God knows he can't be in anything not created by them. But let's give Leslie Nielsen some credit; NOBODY does deadpan like him. And he gets strong support from the rest of the cast. There are some hilarious one-liners and sight gags here; one of my favorites is the final scene with Nordberg (""Oh Frank! Everybody should have a friend like you!""). Also notable are the cameos throughout, including ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, Reggie Jackson, Dick Vitale, Dick Enberg, Dr. Joyce Brothers (as a baseball announcer!), and best of all John Houseman in his final screen appearance, playing a driving instructor in a car Drebbin has to take control of for a chase; the poor teenage girl is still driving, and Houseman is calmly directing her on how to do it, as they speed down the highway. This is classic stuff, and even though its not a serious role, I'm glad he had something so memorable for his last movie.""Naked Gun"" isn't as consistently funny as ""Airplane!"", but it's still one of the funniest movies ever, and further proof (with apologies to Mel Brooks) that the Zuckers are the greatest spoofmakers of all time.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!

The story is simple:Detective Frank Drebin tries to uncover a plan to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II (who is on a state visit to the USA). The main suspect is Vincent Ludwig ,a man (hired by Papshmir, a recurring villain) who has a way of turning anyone into an unknowing assassin at the press of Ludwig's beeper; it appears that the victims are responding to a post-hypnotic suggestion, but the film makes no effort to clarify the point.As he works on the case, Drebin meets and falls in love with Ludwig's assistant Jane Spencer. It is eventually revealed that Jane knows nothing about Ludwig's plot, and after the pair spend the night together, she helps Frank with his investigation.The laughs are more than you can count I can assure you.This spoof of cop movies is excellent watch it immediately.For me the three movies are the greatest comedies of all time.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!

Lt Frank Drebin, an overly incompetent cop, has to foil an attempt at assasinating Queen Elizabeth II, with moments of comic genius. Examples include when he pees with his mic still on at a conference, when Nielsen and Priscilla Presley practice ""safe sex"" by wrapping themselves in plastic and when Drebin keeps injuring the already half-dead O.J. Simpson. It's far better than the inferior sequels(which are still alright) and beats 1980's ""Airplane!"" as the best parody movie.

Not much for plot; it's mainly a bunch of hilarious situations cobbled together to form that ideal of entertainment portion sizes: the screen film.My favorite scene in this film was the mayor's announcement of the Queen's impending arrival and their security measures with Frank and the mike.

Leslie Nielsen, outside of Airplane!, is at his gold here. He handles each and every scene oh so well. There was hardly a moment when he made a joke that I didn't laugh at it. And him being a white haired gentlemen that was getting elderly made it even more hilarious. Unfortunately the Queen doesn't play the Queen here. Instead it's Jeannette Charles, who does do a rather good act of her. I loved how she was so stuffy throughout the entire movie, politely waving and being highly disgusted by mild things. Perhaps one of the funniest moments in the entire flick was when Frank ended up taking the role of Enrico Pallazzo and started singing the National Anthem in a grating tone and incorrect lyrics. That scene was absolutely hilarious! But not nearly as hilarious as when the woman was trying to make a speech, and after Frank drank some cups of water he left his microphone on making his peeing audible during the entire thing.

I gave ""Alien3"" 4 stars, which means that I found a film mediocre. A film that receives 4 stars has some good things going for it, but has serious problems that hinder it from succeeding, and I overall don't like it very much. I gave ""Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" 7 stars, which means that I thought the film was good. While it has a few obvious problems, I still think it has enough good qualities to outweigh them, and overall I find it solid. My next target is ""The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad"". Because this is a spoof, I have to judge it on how funny I thought it was, and how good the comedic performers are. I""m giving this film 9 stars because it made me laugh myself silly.The Positives: -In the vein of their previous films, the Zucker brothers have given us a film where the jokes either hit or miss. For me, I don't recall any moments where they missed. -Leslie Nielsen is in his prime here as Lt. Frank Drebin, and he sells every laugh without breaking a sweat. The entire supporting cast (even O.J. Simpson!) perform admirably here.The Negatives: -Sometimes, the jokes are so silly and/or juvenile that you feel guilty for laughing so hard at them.

He fakes his orgasms, loves a nice stuffed beaver, and laughs through comedies like 'Platoon'. Fresh off of kicking terrorist butt in Beirut, Drebin returns home to an empty apartment and a broken heart. Everywhere he looks, there's something to remind him of his old flame: in the smiling faces of happy couples, or a pair of twin breast-shaped nuclear reactors in San Onofre.Enter Jane (Presley), the lovely assistant of real estate tycoon Vincent Ludwig (Montalban), and the woman of Frank's dreams. ""How 'bout dinner?"" he asks her. She can't make it, but offers a rain-check. ""Well, lets just stick to dinner,"" he replies. They hit it off immediately, but Frank's got bigger fish to fry. Queen Elizabeth II is coming to Los Angeles, and it's up to Drebin and Police Squad, an elite unit of the LAPD, to keep her safe. Ludwig is the villain, and the movie makes it no secret -- by the 10min mark, he's already pumped Frank's partner Nordberg (Simpson) full of bullets. Luckily, Nordberg survives, albeit hospitalized and in critical condition. It's up to Frank and Capt. Ed Hocken (George Kennedy) to counsel his crying wife: ""I think what Frank's trying to say is, as soon as Nordberg's better, he's welcome back on Police Squad,"" Ed explains. Drebin interrupts, ""Unless he's a drooling vegetable -- but that's just common sense.""If it seems like I'm pumping this review full of quotes, I am. This is one of the funniest movies ever made. I can't count how many times I've seen it, and I die laughing each time. Directed by David Zucker, from a script he co-wrote with his brother Jerry and Jim Abrahams, The Naked Gun is based on a failed TV show the three of them produced for NBC, called 'Police Squad!' That the show was canned after only four episodes seems criminal. The ZAZ Boys, who also masterminded such comedy classics as 'Airplane!' and 'Top Secret!', are gifted comedians with a penchant for exclamation marks. Their gift is in casting accomplished dramatic actors to play everything straight. Kennedy was (and still is) an Academy Award winner; Montalban was one of cinema's great villains, playing opposite William Shatner's James T. Kirk in 'The Wrath of Khan'; Presley had been a prime-time soap star for years. Dead-panned, the words and sight gags speak for themselves -- and they speak volumes. Think I've ruined the best bits? Not even close, and you notice something new every time.FINAL SCORE: 9.3 = AThe movie lives and dies by Nielsen, and Jacques Clouseau's got nothing on this hard-boiled doofus. Kicked off the force, Drebin bites his lower lip and says, ""Just think...the next time I shoot a man, I could be arrested."" This is classic comedy through and through.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
150,drebin73,The best movie,10,17 February 2006,"This movie is the best Leslie Nielsen movie. I am a big Leslie Nielsen fan and I am proud to say that it is my favorite movie. Leslie Nielsen stars as Lieutentent Frank Drebin. The clumsy head of Police Squad a special division of the LA Police Force. When the someone attempts to assassinate the queen of england at a dodgers game, its up to Drebin and his buddy cop Ed Hocken played by George Kennedy to find the culprit. In the process, Drebin meets and falls for Jane played by Pricilla Presly. Some spoofs of some classic movies but mainly its Leslie Nielsens deadpan performance that makes the movie as good as it is. The movie was based on an unsuccessful television series called Police Squad which starred Nielsen as well. Leslie Nielsen becomes the funniest man alive when put in the directing style of David Zucker. Although Airplane is a great Zucker movie, this movie is the best. The movie also spawned two sequels: The Naked Gun 2 1/2 The Smell of Fear and Naked Gun 33 1/3 The Final Insult. Leslie Nielsen is the spoofmaster king and he is such a joy to watch. This movie is his triumph. If you liked this movie you want to definitely see the sequels, Wrongfully Accused, Spy Hard, Scary Movie 3( not the first two crappy ones) and the upcoming Scary Movie 4. This movie also stars O.J. Simpson (pre-trial) and Ricardo Montolbaun. See this movie and laugh your butt off.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
151,royals794,You'll laugh till it hurts,10,23 June 2008,"I am rather stingy with my ""perfect 10"" ratings on IMDb; of the nearly 600 films I've rated, I've given only nineteen ""perfect 10s"", or about 3% of all movies. So how did ""The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad"" get the ultimate movie rating from me? By being so ridiculously over-the-top hilarious that it moved me to tears from laughing so hard and literally knocked me off of the couch when I saw it the first time. I remember the first time that I watched ""The Naked Gun."" I was home alone, it was on HBO, and I figured that it might be a funny movie to kill a night with. I was chuckling during the opening scene but what really got me going was the scene in which O.J. Simpson attempts a drug bust on a ship. I laughed uncontrollably from that point forward, at one point falling off my couch from laughter. The jokes are non-stop; there is not a single serious moment in this movie, and the gags are so rapid-fire that you don't notice the unfunny ones because you are too busy laughing at the next one. The whole movie is hilarious, but two scenes stand out as absolute classics to me: the ship scene with O.J. Simpson and the climactic baseball scene. I have seen the movie a dozen times and those two scenes still have me hysterical every time. A must-see film for anyone who likes slapstick humor or just has a sense of humor in general. Leslie Nielsen is superb. 10/10!",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!

Still, there was enough low-brow and physical comedy to crack me up, and it was one of my early favourite movies. While I've outgrown a lot of slapstick movies that I liked a good few years back, I can still watch The Naked Gun and laugh, and I even get the jokes that went way over my head as a kid.The film is somewhat a movie remake of its predecessor ""Police Squad!"", it couldn't be simpler, and that's the way they want it. Lt. Frank Drebin has to to clear the name of his partner Norberg (The killer OJ Simpson to be precise) while protecting the life of Queen Elisabeth, in Los Angeles on a tour of America.

Too bad the sequels aren't quite as good.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
166,alex_t4444,Superb Silliness,9,20 July 2006,"The first of the three Naked Gun films sets the tone for this insanely silly series. The film essentially takes the unfairly short TV series, Police Squad, to the big screen often merely lifting jokes and scenarios from the latter. The manner in which this transition succeeds must largely be thanks to the lead actor Leslie Nielson who plays Lt. Frank Drebbin the unwittingly chaotic police officer.The storyline doesn't really matter (an assassination attempt on Queen Elizabeth II using mind control), it merely contextualises the Zucker and Abrahams format of incessant humour - indeed such is the barrage of jokes that one needs to watch it several times to get the often interwoven layers of slapstick, innuendo, smut, and wordplay on offer here.The aforementioned Nielson is cast superbly as the lead role as he was in Police Squad but unlike the TV series I believe the supporting cast in Naked Gun is better chosen. Simpson, Pressley and Kennedy all play off the lead, who is in almost every scene, and the result is a fabulously funny spoof film that retains its humour nearly 20 years on.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!

I first saw it when I was 8 and I thought it was hilarious back then but I took it at face value and didn't get all the jokes as I was too young. Now I get them and it's even more hilarious. I'm surprised that the Police Squad show was a failure back then.Still, this was great and Leslie Nielsen is just brilliant as Frank Drebin. There are plenty of gags and it doesn't go overboard or try too hard to impress it's audience like 'Scary Movie' or other spoof movies of today that push the envelope of vulgarity to attain cheap laughs. This was flat out comic genius by the men who know their craft. The Zucker brothers.

This series, along with ""Airplane!"" and ""Spy Hard,"" are some of the best slapstick films ever made---and arguably some of the best comedies ever made. ""The Naked Gun"" is full of hilarious slapstick and situation comedy; and Leslie Nielson, with his distinctive, side-splitting acting, makes it all the more funny.

The zany humor of Zucker and Abraham along with Nielsen playing the bumbling detective is played to perfection. The first in the Naked Gun trilogy starts off with a bang as Dectective Frank Drebrin must clear his friend Nordberg (O.J. Simpson)who is under suspicion of dealing heroine. THings get even more confused when the Queen of England arrives on her tour of America. A non stop array of gags and slapstick keeps the film moving and keeps the audience laughing. There is some crude humor, but it is kept in check and better than most comedies that come out these days.

I would list this, Airplane! and Top Secret as my three favorite movies of all time.The best part about this movie is Leslie Nielsen's performance.  In recent films, Nielsen has played his characters as clowns who are trying to be funny.  That's a major mistake.  In The Naked Gun, he plays Lt Frank Drebin as a serious character(much like his performance as the doctor in Airplane!), and it really makes the movie.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!

My favorite: when Hocken says there is a 10 % chance of there being a 50/50 chance of Nordberg recovering.

This film contains a performance of pure brilliance by Leslie Nielson who has shown people that he is the master of spoof films {Mel Brooks not included} This laugh out loud performance by Nielson is excuse alone to watch this film but is supported brilliantly by George Kennedy, O.J Simpson, Priscilla Presley and Ricardo Montalban. This film's ""plot"" is basically the queen of England is visiting the states and Frank Drebin of police Squad is put in charge of security while a terrorist organisation plan her assassination and only Luitenent Frank Drebin of Police Squad can stop it.

As Lt. Frank Drebin, Nielson falls into the case of a lifetime when his friend Nordberg (OJ Simpson), is severely injured in a police raid gone bad and information surfaces that there may be an assassination attempt against the visiting queen of England. From that point on, this movie contains classic elements of perseverance, adventure, and true love, but uses them all to produce a satire on police life and life in general.

It is therefore impossible that the same person who watches Dumb and Dumber (an absolutely awful movie) can find Naked Gun funny.

It's an altogether serious movie about police detectives investigating murdered teens.
This movie opens with a one minute-20 second ""one take scene"" shot by a camera mounted on the police car roof--behind the flashing light bar. It looks like you see the entire drive from the station to the crime scene.

As soon as the movie starts, to the very minute it ends, the gag never stops. There is not one moment when a joke is not happening, at that is what makes this movie so funny. I was smiling throughout the whole movie. I was giggling throughout most of it. I was historically laughing at least 10 times, and was even in tears twice. The acting from Leslie Nielsen who plays a hilarious and oblivious policeman was perfect for his role, and it made the movie. This is as movie that I could re-watch multiple times and never get bored, because of the energy that this movie gives out. All of the actors looked like they were having a blast making this, and at the end of the day, thats what makes a movie good- when the people involved are having fun with it.

The only problem is that Batman was released in 1989, a year after The Naked Gun was released. Therefore, did Batman copy off of The Naked Gun? Was that scene in the movie even a parody of anything?

196,andrewireland,One of the Funniest Ever,10,4 April 2008,"""The Naked Gun"" and ""Airplane"", both by the same directors, rank on my list as 2 of the funniest movies ever made. The perfect mixture of slapstick jokes, satires of the classic cop movie, political jokes, and just plain silliness makes ""The Naked Gun"" a great comedy for all ages.Leslie Neilsen as Frank Dreben is the best and most memorable role of his career. All of the supporting actors give credible and hilarious performances as well. The jokes come rapid fire, and most surprisingly of all, there is an actual plot that is interesting, a rare commodity in today's ""satires"" like ""Date Movie"" and ""Epic Movie"".Two thumbs way way up!",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
197,piano-boy,Funniest Lines,9,29 March 2005,"What are some of the Funniest lines in this movie? Frank: It's true what they say: Jane climbs a ladder Frank: Saayyy, nice beaver. Jane Spencer: producing a stuffed beaver Thanks. I just had it stuffed. Frank Drebin is emptying out his files after being kicked off the force Frank: Hey! The missing evidence in the Kelner case! He really was innocent! Ed: Frank, Kelner went to the chair two years ago. Frank: Well, uh... Frank Drebin quickly shoves the evidence back into the file cabinet Jane Spencer: I wanted you to know, now, I've loved you since the first day I met you, and I'll never stop. I'm a very lucky woman. Frank: So am I... Drebin searches a drawer Frank: Bingo! pulls out a bingo card",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
198,hgtaxlaw,Priceless!!!,10,13 August 2005,"Leslie Nielsen IS the Lord High Sultan of Slapstick!!! For me, this is the performance that made his reputation forever as a comic genius. He rules!!!No matter how many times I've watched this movie (and I've seen it a zillion times), I always end up in tears from laughing so hard. Some of the sight gags are the greatest ever shot on film.Cases in point: 1) The scene where Drebin tackles the Queen and they go sliding across the full length table.2) The last scene where Nordberg goes flying out of the upper deck.3) Where Ludwig falls over the side and gets run over by a steamroller, a marching band and a circus. And Ed says that his dad went the same way.This is just untouchable!!!",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
199,nickgill1,How cool the film is,10,19 September 2005,"The Naked Gun series are the funniest films on the planet!!! Everyone should buy them!!!! The jokes are non-stop. ""What would he be doing there?"" ""Sex Frank"" ""Er not now Ed, we have work to do"" HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. I laughed so much when Drebin leaned over the research machine in the second film and his hard hat fell in and broke it. Leslie is the master of pulling faces! In 33 1/3 when Tanya Peters (who is so hot without the slightly strange addition) reveals her dong :S Leslie Nielson makes the funniest stupidest face ever! And the pigeon, that Frank chucks through the window, that bit was hilarious. Everyone has to watch the Naked Gun series!!!!!!!!!!",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!

201,banares_mario,Whats the song played during the baseball game?,9,17 April 2006,"Does anyone know the name of the kool song (and artist) played during the baseballgame in the movie?? I cant find it on the soundtrack list.....if you know please e-mail it to me. The movie is great within its genre. I guess it is one of the first satires made on police plots and it makes fun of the typical klichés, at the same time, because of doing so the movie also contains all the elements needed to make it as interesting as any police movie. I am just writing this to get my 10 lines which are required to get my comment in hehe, maybe there is a place for questions but I'm too stupid to find it. Anyway, i hope someone can help me.",The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!
