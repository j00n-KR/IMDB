0,bkoganbing,"Old, but good",5,28 October 2013,"The long awaited collaboration of action stars Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger has finally arrived with Escape Plan. Neither are exactly in their salad days and so we're not seeing a meeting of Rambo and the Terminator. But I wish they had not picked a story that was so ridiculous.Stallone plays a master escape artist who gets himself thrown into prisons and proceeds to escape from them. He and partner Vincent Donofrio have a security business which advises correction facilities how to beef up their security. However he gets a contract to break out of a really secure facility which no one seems to officially know about that's headed by Jim Caveziel that has a unique location.During the course of his incarceration Sly meets up with Schwarzenegger who is playing an international banker. His tracking device has also been removed so Sly's backup team of Curtis Jackson and Amy Ryan have no lifeline. Sly and Arnie form an alliance of convenience.I was having trouble during this entire film of understanding why such a prison exists. It houses not real lawbreakers as such, but people that powerful people just want out of the way. Wouldn't it be easier to kill them?Still there's enough action to satisfy Rambo and Terminator fans and in that Escape Plan doesn't fail to deliver. Sly and Arnie are old, but they're good.",Escape Plan
1,Leofwine_draca,"A solid, if not great, prison thriller",6,24 September 2017,"ESCAPE PLAN is another prison movie from Sylvester Stallone and the third such film he's appeared in, following on from ESCAPE TO VICTORY and LOCK UP. This one's notable for featuring the ROCKY star teaming up with Arnold Schwarzenegger for a buddy action movie for the first time in their careers. Sure, they were in THE EXPENDABLES trilogy together, but they were more ensemble pieces and the two actors didn't share too many scenes.ESCAPE PLAN starts off well with a very strong first half. In a plot similar to FACE/OFF, Stallone goes undercover and is incarcerated in a secret prison where he loses his true identity and is pushed by the sadistic warden. He enlists Schwarzenegger's help in order to facilitate an escape. That's the whole story. The writing gets sloppy in the second half, but there's plenty of action to take your mind off the inconsistencies of the narrative, and there's something pleasingly old-fashioned and '80s feeling about the depiction of the events. Jim Caviezel makes a good villain, alongside stock henchman Vinnie Jones and Sam Neill playing a doctor.",Escape Plan
2,SnoopyStyle,Love the first half and then ...,6,7 June 2014,"Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) is an escape expert. He is hired to be put into prisons and escape. Abigail (Amy Ryan) and Hush (50 Cent) are his team and Lester Clark (Vincent D'Onofrio) gets them the job. The CIA comes calling to test a privately-run secret prison for the worst of the worst. When he's taken, his team lose track of him. The prison warden Hobbes (Jim Caviezel) refuses to let him go even though he gives the evacuation code. Rottmayer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is one of the prisoners who helps Breslin but they're on their own.I really love the first half of this movie. Sylvester Stallone really grew on me. The team and the jobs are interesting. Everything is going well. It makes sense why Hobbes wouldn't release Breslin at first. The first problem comes in the form of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Immediately, I am afraid of cheesy 80s action camp coming. For awhile, Arnold did his job and the story moves on. He did his best, and got a few jokes in. I actually prefer not to have the joking around. The sense of cheesy camp is always near and that's what the jokes are. Then the movie goes full on cheese. It's like a time warp into an old Arnold action movie when he takes the big machine gun.There is also the problem of why some of these prisoners aren't just killed off. Why would a drug cartel care to keep Javed alive? No idea. Why not just torture Victor Manheim out of Rottmayer? No idea. Why wouldn't Hobbes kill Breslin once he finds out who he really is? No idea. There was somebody else (spoilers) who should want him dead. What happened?It is so disappointing that this is not a better movie. It starts off so well but it's an obvious mistake to team up with Arnold doing serious action. That era is over and the guys are old. It may work in a jokey way in the Expendables franchise. This should be much better.",Escape Plan
3,Prismark10,Men in a hole,5,2 February 2014,"In Escape Plan, Stallone plays Breslin, a former Prosecutor turned Security consultant who breaks out of prisons to test their flaws.Breslin is offered by the CIA a chance to test out a maximum security prison run by a shadow private undercover organisation that imprisons high level terrorist types.Before you can say 'set-up' Breslin agrees for double his usual fee.The rest of the film is essentially a bottle type of drama as i its contained within the Hi Tech interior prison environment that keeps the budget down.Breslin finds out that he might be on his own in this prison with no chance of escape or being rescued. He might have been double crossed by his business partner (rather foreseeable) and to make things worse, Arnie is one of the inmates and is trying too hard to be his friend.Jim Caviezel who previously has come across as a rather bland leading man, camps it up as Hobbes, the sadistic prison warden who does not care whether Breslin is innocent.Which begs the question as to how many other inmates might be there for obscure reasons in this private consortium prison for the disappeared.Sam Neill appears as a conflicted doctor who is there to provide minimal medical attention to the prisoners.Fair play to Arnie and Sly for not going for a shoot em up, although that was already done in Expendables 2. It is a more thoughtful movie. There is some gun toting action at the end.I would be the first to admit I did not understand what Arnie was doing in this type of prison although I sort of guessed his true identity.You can imagine there would be Islamic terrorists housed in this Hi-tech prison, but then you also get white supremacists type, cartel gangsters and others who should be in a maximum security prison not housed in a prison for people who could no longer be sent to Guantanamo Bay.We have Farhan Tahir playing a Muslim who helps Arnie and Sly but is he a terrorist or a cartel guy? If he is a cartel guy, he should not be in this prison, something the film never grapples with even though Tahir is the third hero of the film.Plenty of plot holes in the film. No one inside the prison discovers that although they might be located deep down, they are actually in a ship and no amount of stabilizers can protect you from heavy seas or even the humming of the engines in such a big cargo ship.Surely such as a ship would have to dock for supplies, change of crew and prison guards?It is fun, maybe too long and has confusing plot elements.",Escape Plan
4,claudio_carvalho,"Prison, Betrayal and Revenge with Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger – What Else Could I Want in an Action Movie?",7,15 February 2014,"Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) is a renowned specialist in prison breaking in high-security facilities. He owns a company with his partner Lester Clark (Vincent D'Onofrio) and he works with his coworkers and friends Abigail (Amy Ryan) and Hush (50 Cent). Breslin follows three basic rules to escape: to know the layout; observe the routine; and get internal or external support to the getaway. Then he delivers a report with the flaws in the system to his client.Breslin and his team are visited by the CIA agent Jessica Miller (Caitriona Balfe) that offers five-million dollars to him to test a state-of-art facility. Breslin accepts the challenge but soon he learns that he was double-crossed. The cruel prison ward Hobbes (Jim Caviezel) gives special attention to Breslin, following the instructions of his client and uses his right arm Drake (Vinnie Jones) to break Breslin. But the inmate Rottmayer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) gets close to Breslin and helps him to find a way to escape and find who betrayed him. Will they be well succeeded in their intent?""Escape Plan"" is a full of action movie with Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger and a great cast.

5,nogodnomasters,YOU DON'T LOOK THAT SMART,8,3 May 2018,"Ray Breslin (Stallone) is an expert at escaping from prison. He accepts a job at a high tech prison which is off the grid, i.e. doesn't officially exist. However, Ray is double crossed and is now in a situation where he must escape to survive. The film includes fellow inmate Arnold Schwarzenegger and Vinnie Jones as a sadistic guard. This is not a simple grunt escape film, but develops levels of complexity with twists.The film is an action drama with some thrills. By modern action standards it moves slow so it can develop the story. There is a rivalry banter mixed into the dialog between Arnold and Stallone for those who pay attention.Worth a view for old Arnie and Sly fans. Don't pay too much. Should be a bargain film soon after it goes to DVD.Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity.",Escape Plan
6,kosmasp,It speaks ... but it's OK,7,2 June 2014,"I'm still amazed and will not seize to be, how someone with an accent as thick as the one that Arnold has, became such a big star. It's not his acting abilities that made him famous, that is for sure. But when it comes to light fun like this, he does excel. Yes this is Stallone movie (he is starring), but Arnold plays a major role in this. And it's fun to watch those two on screen.The story itself is pretty thin and you will know where it is going every step of the way. Mostly being ahead of the game multiple steps. But that won't take away (too much) of the fun you will have. The movie is still entertaining enough and has a healthy dose of tension to keep you more than interested. 80s throwback? Yes, but in a good sense",Escape Plan
7,classicsoncall,"""You hit like a vegetarian.""",5,22 June 2021,"Good grief! If Warden Hobbes (Jim Caviezel) wanted to put the kabosh on Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) and Emil Rottmayer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) from causing so much havoc, why didn't he just have them separated? They were always in plain sight talking and making plans together, you had to know they were up to no good. I don't for a minute think that even the most brilliant security expert in the world could have figured out how to get off that tanker in the middle of the ocean, but hey, it's Rocky and The Terminator so anything is possible. I had a pretty good idea Breslin's partner Lester Clark (Vincent D'Onofrio) was going to put the screws to him; he gave it away every time he was questioned by Abigail (Amy Ryan). My favorite gimmick here was that whole business with the sextant helping to determine they were off the coast of Morocco. Don't even ask if that was a remote possibility, especially when the job was handed off to a Muslim extremist (Faran Tahir). Totally laughable. But the best was that suitable ending when Clark found himself in the same situation he put Breslin in. I don't think anyone will ever be able to find him.",Escape Plan
8,jboothmillard,Escape Plan,5,22 February 2015,"I heard about this film during its release, the two leading stars who got together to create Planet Hollywood and starred together in The Expendables teaming together again was obviously good to see, so I was sure this would be an easy to settle into action flick, directed by Mikael Håfström (Derailed, 1408). Basically former prosecutor Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) is the co-owner of a security firm specialising in testing the reliability of maximum security prisons, he had devoted his life to making all prisons inescapable by posing as an inmate and trying to see if he can break out, and he has done a good job so far. CIA agent Jessica Miller (Caitriona Balfe) approaches Breslin and has an assignment for him, a new maximum security prison has been built and is due to be launched for the worst criminals to be incarcerated, so as usual it his job to go in and make sure no one can get out, he agrees and necessary preparations are made. The prison warden is told who Breslin is and that he has been given a code so the warden will know he is not a convict, and a tracer is planted on him, but being picked up those who do so remove the tracer, he arrives at the prison the warden is Willard Hobbes (Jim Caviezel), not the same warden he met, he tells him his code, but he claims he doesn't know what he is talking about, he realises someone doesn't want him to get out. Breslin tries to find a way out using the skills he has developed over the years, about structural placements, guard positions and all sorts of setups, of course this prison is supposed to be inescapable, even for him, so he becomes friendly with another prisoner, inmate Emil Rottmayer (Arnold Schwarzenegger), who works for a man named Victor Mannheim , they decide to work together to get out. They try to withstand the punishing elements that comes from being in this prison, including specially designed cages used for antisocial and violent prisoners as punishment, these cages use special high beams to heat up and temporarily blind those put inside, but escape is made much harder when during a chance breakout from his cell Breslin learns that the prison is contained on a large ship. In the end, after much hardship, prisoners, prison staff and others killed in the process, and fighting their way out with whatever weapons and tools they can get their hands on, and killing vicious Hobbes and his henchmen, Breslin and Rottmeyer do the impossible and manage a successful escape plan, Rottmeyer reveals that he is in fact Mannheim, and Miller is his daughter, and Lester Clark (Vincent D'Onofrio) who masterminded the plan to stop him escaping is trapped in a container on a cargo ship going to an unknown location. Also starring Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson as Hush, Sam Neill as Dr. Kyrie, Vinnie Jones as Drake, Amy Ryan as Abigail Ross and Faran Tahir as Javed. Sylvester and Schwarzenegger do their usual chiselled faces and tough guy talk as they work together relatively well planning a breakout, and Caviezel is a good choice as the sinister warden who will do anything to stop anyone getting out, in honesty this is nothing new, I have seen many prison escape films, including those set somewhere that is supposed to be impregnable, but that is not say that this is a bad film, you do still find yourself going along with it and hoping that they can pull it off, a reasonable action thriller. Worth watching!",Escape Plan

10,paul_haakonsen,Schwarzenegger and Stallone truly delivers...,7,15 April 2014,"Having grown up with the action movies of Stallone and Schwarzenegger, to name but a few, during my childhood and youth, then it is always refreshing to see these iconic action stars on the screen.Initially, I had some reservations about ""Escape Plan"", especially since this is the third prison movie of Stallone's, and the synopsis for this movie didn't really promise something great.But I am glad that I saw it, because ""Escape Plan"" delivered the goods. This is a great action/thriller in every sense, and if you grew up with Stallone and Schwarzenegger's movies, then you definitely do not want to miss out on this one.The storyline, shortly summarized, is about Ray Breslin (played by Stallone) who goes undercover in secure prison facilities in order to test their security measures and prove that they are indeed not inescapable. Taking on a new job, Breslin finds himself in over his head in a very strange facility, where he has to team up with Rottmayer (played by Schwarzenegger) if he is to break free of captivity.The action sequences are great, as they always are with these guys. But what also made the movie so great, was the plot line and the revealing of what was really going on with the prison facility. That was a twist of events that I found really good.There are some great names to the cast list, aside from Stallone and Schwarzenegger, such as Sam Neill, Vinnie Jones and Vincent D'Onofrio. Personally I can't claim to find any enjoyment in hip hop star 50 cents as an actor, and he is not one I would put my money on. But luckily his role is a minor one.""Escape Plan"" is definitely a man's movie, full of action, testosterone (although not up to par with ""Expendables), and an interesting and well executed storyline. The movie is definitely well worth a watch if you enjoy action and thrillers.",Escape Plan
11,edwagreen,Please escape from this film *1/2,3,13 December 2014,"After 1976's Rocky,can't Sylvester Stallone make a decent film? Methinks not. This one is no exception to the rule either. In fact, I may term it another colossal stinker by our always true hero.In this farce, Stallone works for the government and his objective is to see if he can break out of prisons, no matter secure they attempt to be. Stallone soon finds himself in an awkward position of being incarcerated and we go through the entire film not knowing what is going on. This prison is on a ship run by Jim Caviezel, a nasty and vicious head.The film finally shows us that we can't even trust higher-ups in the penal system, when opportunity knocks for them.California's former governor Arnold portrays a mystery man who comes to the aid of Stallone in this weird and often unexciting film.",Escape Plan
12,BandSAboutMovies,Prison for Sly. Again.,4,2 September 2019,"Despite the teaming of Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger, Escape Plan underperformed at the U.S. box office. So how have there been three of these films? Simple. International box-office success, as this movie debuted in first place in several foreign markets, with the total international gross more than doubling its $50 million budget, leading to a worldwide gross of $137.3 million.Ray Breslin (Stallone) is a former prosecutor, businessman and skilled structure engineer, but he's really known for being the world's best escape artist. As part of Breslin-Clark, he poses as an inmate to test supermax prisons from the inside out. His goal? Keeping criminals in jail, because back when he was a lawyer, his wife and child were killed by a convict he put away that escaped.Breslin and business partner Lester Clark (Vincent D'Onofrio) get a multimillion-dollar offer from CIA agent Jessica Mayer, who wants them to test a top secret prison where several prisoners have disappeared. They're not told where this prison is, but Breslin allows himself to be captured. However, things go wrong right away, as his tracking chip is removed and he has no idea where he is.Now, he's under the control of Warden Hobbes (Jim Caviezel) and meets fellow prisoner Emil Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger). Together with Javed, a Muslim prisoner, they start to create an escape plan - but soon learn that they are on a cargo ship in the middle of the ocean.This movie is packed with interesting supporting players. Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson plays Hush, Ray's best friend and technical expert. Sam Neill is a prison doctor. And former soccer star Vinnie Jones is the lead guard.Escape Plan was directed by Mikael Hafstrom (1408) and was written by Jason Keller and Miles Chapman, who has written all of the Escape Plan films.

14,Scarecrow-88,Escape Plan,7,6 September 2014,"While I do believe Escape Plan brings together two action icons twenty-five years too late, I think we have taken their pairing here for granted. Escape Plan is still a whole lot of fun if you love Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger because their chemistry together is quite gnarly. As a prison escape film, Escape Plan has to deliver, and this one has a doozy of a plot. So Stallone is a ""prison escape specialist"", brilliant and motivated by a tragic event when he was a prosecutor (okay, so this is a stretch even for Stallone fans) that has provided reasoning behind wanting to create an inescapable prison. He's betrayed by his partner (Vincent D'Onofrio) of their company and sent to a prison built within a large, long ship rested on the ocean near Morocco. Inspired by Stallone's novel on an impenetrable prison, ice-cold warden Caviezel has done a swell job on building a model one for his ship. Caviezel has this smug, self-confidence that is entertaining to see derailed by Stallone and his association with Schwarzenegger (who befriends him for reasons revealed later). Arnold knows details about a shadowy character named Mannheim who could render banks/currency in several countries harm. Caviezel and D'Onofrio are in cahoots and need to catch Mannheim and by breaking Arnold that is possible. Through the budding friendship with Stallone, they believe through proper persuasion (all freedoms taken away and isolated in another wing by his lonesome). It seems that Caviezel's prison ship has D'Onofrio as a benefactor, using his association with Stallone as proper driving force to fortify it against any prison break capability. Stallone's ""task force"" and brains of Amy Ryan and 50 Cent in his company is hijacked by D'Onofrio's efforts (keeping them in the dark regarding his criminal conspiracy behind their backs), so retrieving their boss will not be easy. Stallone just might encourage help from a morally conflicted doc on board the ship (Sam Neill) in order to get word to his task force. Meanwhile, our heroes receive an ally in former opium dealer, played by Faran Tahir (who does the most with his limited role), who has reformed and willing to help them in exchange for escape. All this takes place under the all-seeing-eye of Caviezel, so it will take cleverness, ingenuity, and long-term wisdom (Stallone's expertise are specially augmented throughout the film as his interest and exercise in knowing when to studiously look at all the angles and how prisons are operated (routines by guards, as example) is established distinctly) to pull off the ultimate in prison escapes. We get to see Stallone and Arnie on screen for almost the entire running time, and while the former has the more elaborate character, the latter ultimately has the neat reveal of his intentions the whole time which describes how amusingly slick the story plays out to the end. I was surprised at how smart this film turned outthis isn't actually the typical dumb fun we seen from these two; there were some actual smarts involved. From the director of 1408 & The Rite, Mikael Håfström. Just to see Stallone and Arnie engage in ""fake"" fisticuffs and fighting side by side in prison is worth checking this out. But I never tire seeing Vinnie Jones (as a menacing guard allowed to brutalize Stallone in the prison) get his ass kicked by action heroes, this time by Stallone who has more than enough reason to take the fight to him. The opening prison escape and Stallone's subsequent explanation of how he did it is stellar.",Escape Plan
15,Hey_Sweden,The team-up finally happens.,7,15 December 2014,"Action genre titans Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger become full-fledged co- stars for the first time in this agreeable bit of escapist entertainment. Sly stars as Ray Breslin, a man with a very specialized line of work. He's a security expert who exposes flaws in the systems of various prisons. Basically, he's paid to be an escape artist. He agrees to take on the task of testing an ultra sophisticated fortress, designed by the government to house undesirables whom they don't necessarily want to execute, but permanently hide away. You guessed it: things don't go as planned, and it seems that somebody wants Ray to stay in this place forever. Fortunately, he soon acquires an ally, a cunning character named Rottmayer (played by Arnold).An effectively low key Jim Caviezel is the cold blooded villain of the piece, directed (by Mikael Hafstrom) and edited (by Elliot Greenberg) with style. There's lots of action and violence, although the picture isn't overtly gory. The visual effects are excellent and perfectly supplement some great eye candy production design (by Barry Chusid). It's a great deal of fun to see Sly and Arnold work together, and each is in fine form. The two of them both get to play men who are not only tough sons of bitches but also quite intelligent and crafty. Soon, Ray does begin to see elements in this prison that he can exploit.Our two stars also have the benefit of working with some terrific supporting actors. Vincent D'Onofrio, 50 Cent, and the lovely Amy Ryan play Ray's co-workers. Sam Neill has the role of the doctor whom Ray must convince to remember his Hippocratic Oath. Faran Tahir has a decent presence as a convict named Javed. Vinnie Jones does well as Drake the guard.One element this viewer found to be rather memorable was the fact that the guards in The Tomb wear masks.Things aren't always completely satisfactory, but this high tech entertainment still commands ones' attention for close to two hours.Seven out of 10.",Escape Plan

This is one of those Nostalgic Nonsense Things that Tries Very Hard to Re-Represent Glories of the Past with Predictably Mixed Results.This isn't Awful and it isn't Very Good, it just is and has a Certain Amount of Drawing Power that here is Kinda Wasted. Why, for Example, is a Throw-Back to Dumb Action Movies Attempting to be Smart. Arnold tells Sly at one Point, ""You don't look that smart."" Neither does the Movie, although the Wordy Script Tries to make it so.No One Watching this Thing really Cares about all the Blueprint Stuff and how it is Deconstructed by a Genius Escape Artist, Mathematician, Puzzle Solver, and All Around Egghead. Yes this is the Character Stallone Plays and it just doesn't Matter One Hoot in this Type of Thing how Brainy He is. What does Matter is how much Bad Guy Butt gets Kicked and how Stylish it gets Kicked.There isn't a lot of Stylish Butt Kicking here and there are Bad Guys around that need some Serious Kicking. But the Movie waits around til the Final Act to Deliver this and it is Rushed and is Hardly worth the Wait. James Cavaziel is a Slimy Warden and comes off the Best in Support, but the rest are just there for Name Recognition and are Inconsequential even when They are Part of the Overwritten Plot.

He must devise a way to escape the inescapable and find out just who has it in for him. Luckily for him, Arnie is also in the same jail and so agrees to help with the cunning escape plan - despite plenty of animosity from the fellow inmates and the ever watchful eyes of ""Hobbes"" - the sort of Governor (Jim Caviezel). Sly has to get extra points for daring to look 67, with Arnie just one year younger - and they do gel quite well together but the direction of travel is way too obvious for the film to arouse any sense of tension or suspense.

He is approached by a woman claiming to work for the government who wants him to test a prison and he agrees. But uh-oh looks like it's a set-up and now Sly is stuck inside an inescapable hi-tech prison run by evil warden Jim Caviezel. Lucky for Sly, his plans were used to design the prison. So he teams with fellow geriatric inmate Arnold Schwarzenegger and comes up with -- you guessed it -- an escape plan! It's sad for someone who grew up watching his movies to see Arnold so old. But it happens to all of us. Sly holds up better, thanks to all of the legal and illegal substances he's been pumping into himself for years. It's also sad to see Arnold's acting continues to be weak in his post-Governor years. Say what you will about his acting in his early career, he improved a lot by the time he ""retired"" and always had a great screen presence. But since his return to acting after being Governor, he's just been terrible. His line delivery is often stiff and awkward. However, he provides most of the movie's humor. Both intentional and unintentional. This is the best performance I've seen from 50 Cent, for what that's worth. Vincent D'Onofrio hams it up nicely. Caviezel relishes playing the bad guy. What the hell was Sam Neill doing in this? In a minor role, no less. Are things really that bad, Dr. Grant? The premise is extremely far-fetched but I can forgive that if the movie is entertaining enough. This is an enjoyable action flick but nothing exemplary. There is also some camp value from some of the hammy performances. Nostalgia may make it more appealing for some. Children of the '80s longed for a Schwarzenegger/Stallone team-up for years. But I doubt they ever expected it to be when they were oldsters and Arnold was the comic relief sidekick. I know I didn't. Still, solid action movie with some nice humor and a good cast that sweeps you up in its ridiculousness. Nice twist at the end, too.",Escape Plan
19,zardoz-13,A Slam-Bang Prison Extravaganza!!!,8,21 October 2013,"Action superstars Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger co-star in ""1408"" director Mikael Hafstrom's ""Escape Plan,"" an audacious but improbable prison break epic that delivers brawny thrills and chills galore. Unlike the last two ""Expendables"" outings, Stallone and Schwarzenegger appear here on equal footing in more than rather than a couple of scenes. Basically, we've got ""Rocky"" and ""The Terminator"" tangling with Mr. Reese from the provocative, CBS-TV thriller ""Person of Interest."" If you're expecting another wise-cracking yarn with our heroes spouting clever one-liners, you're going to be disappointed. Indeed, little of the dialogue in ""Escape Plan"" deserves to be immortalized on bumper stickers. Refreshingly, neither do our stars make any references to their previous Hollywood blockbusters. Everybody plays it straight-forward in this survival-of-the-fittest saga. Meanwhile, most of the testosterone-laden action consists of men either beating or shooting the living daylights out of each other in examples of outlandish, over-the-top violence. Stallone is cast against type as a mature, serious-minded, MacGyver-like hero with a Houdini talent for crashing out of prisons, while Schwarzenegger plays one of the most dangerous men alive behind bars. Jim Caviezel is cast against type, too, as a villain so dastardly that you will squeal with glee when he gets his comeuppance. Former British soccer star Vinnie Jones chews the scenery with relish as Caviezel's second-in-command. Jones' evil prison guard shows no qualms about smashing inmates to a pulp as if they were drums.Scenarists Miles Chapman of ""Road House 2: Last Call"" and Jason Keller of ""Machine Gun Preacher"" generate plenty of suspense about the mysterious setting of the prison. After an exciting introductory sequence at a Colorado prison where our hero demonstrates his masterly escape artist credentials, the remainder of ""Escape Plan"" occurs in an imposing penitentiary designed for the worst of the worst. Essentially, the convicts occupy cells that resemble glass cages stacked atop each other and framed with steel beams. ""Source Code"" production designer Barry Chusid has surpassed himself with this visually intriguing setting. Well-armed, incorruptible, prison guards decked out from head to foot in black uniforms with sinister Guy Fawkes masks reminiscent of the police in director George Lucas' dystopian sci-fi chiller ""THX-1138"" patrol the premises. An around-the-clock surveillance system denies the inmates any privacy. Hafstrom and his writers will keep you guessing for about an hour into the action where this impressive pen could be situated. When Stallone finally figures out its whereabouts, the revelation is comparable to the lair of a James Bond villain. While ""Escape Plan"" recycles some of the usual prison movie shenanigans, the imaginative setting sets this movie apart.Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone of ""First Blood"") has broken out of 14 prisons over the last eight years. He has formed his one-of-kind company with Lester Clark (Vincent D'Onofrio of ""Full Metal Jacket"") along with Abigail (Amy Ryan of ""Green Zone"") and computer wizard Hush (Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson of ""Get Rich Or Die Trying'""). Out of the blue, the Central Intelligence Agency makes Ray an offer that he cannot refuse. They challenge Ray to break out of their super-max slammer, and they are prepared to pay him twice his usual million dollar fee. Initially, Ray doesn't like the set-up. Abigail and Hush share his dread. Lester thinks it will be a picnic. Reluctantly Ray accepts their dare against his better judgment. Predictably, things go badly from the outset. Our hero is abducted, drugged, and the homing device embedded in his body that enables Abigail and Hush to track him is removed. The moment Ray awakens in his exotic prison cell, he wants out of the proposition. Unfortunately, he learns that he is going nowhere. It seems treacherous Lester has double-crossed him, and Warden Hobbes (Jim Caviezel of ""The Thin Red Line"") has orders to keep him permanently on ice. Ironically, Ray discovers Hobbes has designed his prison security measures based on Ray's book about the most common structural flaws in prison security!Ray finds himself surrounded by a formidable population of inmates that want to kill him. Initially, one of these brutes is Emil Rottmayer (Arnold Schwarzenegger of ""The Last Stand""), and they don't cotton to each other. When Ray clobbers Emil with his first blow, Emil observes with a smirk, ""You hit like a vegetarian!"" When the Muslim brotherhood decides to gang up on Ray, Emil changes his mind and comes to our hero's rescue. Eventually, Ray and Emil become friends. Ray explains that he has been paid to break out. He suffers a number of set-backs, but he recovers from Hobbes' savage treatment with Emil's help. Ray reveals his formula for success. He must study the layout of the prison, and this means he must incite a riot so Hobbes can throw him in solitary confinement. Solitary confinement is the equivalent of Hell where inmates are caged up and subjected to a blazing battery of search lights that turn the cage into an oven. Ray notices the screws that in the floor plates are steel rather than aluminum. He suspects the prison may be located in a vast underground cavern. Next, he scrutinizes the rotation of the guards and their routines while they watch the inmates. The most important part of Ray's plan is finding somebody on the inside who will help them since he is cut off from Abigail and Hush. The most likely candidate is the prison doctor, Dr. Kyrie (Sam Neill of ""Jurassic Park""), but he displays considerable reluctance.Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger should have teamed up long before ""Escape Plan"" because they radiate convincing camaraderie. Director Mikael Hafstrom never lets the momentum lag, and he minimizes the clichés that crop up in most prison flicks. For example, the Muslim inmates are rehabilitated as heroes after they join Ray and Emil. Our heroes suffer considerably at the hands of the sadistic warden and his lieutenant before they triumph. The worst thing about ""Escape Plan"" is that its exterior computer-generated imagery appears less than spectacular.",Escape Plan

However, he ends up in a prison facility which looks as if it might beat him, even with the assistance of fellow inmate Rottmayer (Arnold Schwarzenegger).This action thriller teams Stallone and Schwarzenegger to considerably better effect than their recent solo outings. The plot is fairly original, the two stars have effective chemistry, there are some surprises on route, and some well-staged action sequences (albeit rather too much magic ammunition). Jim Caviezel is an effective ruthless prison boss. The character behind Breslin being cut off from support isn't too difficult to figure out, but that's a small quibble in an undemanding but fun movie.I'm not sure of the point behind Vincent D'Onofrio's hygiene fixation: this went nowhere.Nonetheless, I enjoyed this, and I recommend it.",Escape Plan
22,Uriah43,Quite a Bit of Action and Suspense,7,20 December 2013,"""Ray Breslin"" (Sylvester Stallone) is an escape artist who is hired by prison systems to test the security of their facilities. Typically, this involves him assuming the identity of a prisoner so that he is able to operate in that capacity without the guards or the other prisoners realizing who he is and what his mission might be. Once outside the prison his team picks him and up and he generates his report to the warden. However, in the event he cannot escape he has a special code he can give to the warden which would allow him to abandon his task and grant his release. That said, in one specific case the CIA contacts him to test one of their secret facilities used to incarcerate terrorists. He agrees even though his team does not like the idea. Unfortunately, once inside this maximum security prison he is double-crossed and left entirely on his own. And he has no way out. It is at this time that he meets another prisoner named ""Emil Rottmayer"" (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who he informs of his identity in a desperate bid to escape the nightmare he has found himself in. Now, there was a time about 25 years ago when the concept of casting both Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the same film would have caused a sensation within the motion picture business. And while their pairing is still quite impressive today it pales in comparison to that earlier time. Naturally, as one might expect from either of these two actors there is quite a bit of action and suspense and people who enjoyed earlier films from them won't be disappointed. That said, this was a pretty good movie and I rate it as above average.",Escape Plan

Sylvester Stallone plays Ray Breslin whose life work involves escaping every prison in order to reinstate a tighter security policy. Central plot regards a task gone wrong and he ends up awakening in a glass cell amongst other glass cells holding prisoners. He must figure out how he got there and where he is. He knows he was set up but nobody will listen except Emil Rottmayer, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger who takes an interest in Breslin. Soon the two are teaming up mentally in order to outwit the system and figure this whole puzzle out. While this is mainly just a mindless action film it is better written than first expected. While the brutal action violence is presented throughout it also details the escape plan and routes to freedom, which is the best aspect of the film. Director Makael Hafstrom dealt with a similar situation in his entertaining thriller 1408 and the mediocre Derailed also about heroes caught within dilemmas that they attempt to outwit. Stallone and Schwarzenegger are terrific together right up to the quirky twist ending. Unfortunately Jim Caviezel as villain and prison head Hobbes is downright boring. Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson is greatly underused as a colleague of Breslin's. Sam Neill is featured as a doctor whom the heroes are able to get through to and eventually find sympathy with. This is a decent escape plan for action lovers. Score: 8 / 10",Escape Plan

The two greatest action stars of all time are now finally in a movie together, in proper roles, and thank goodness it wasn't as cops in drag as promised in 1992.Mach people will, and have balked at the idea of two aged action stars still trying to command the big screen, but there are a few of us who know what to expect from a film like this, and it doesn't fail to deliver, in droves.Stallone is as expected. He is the serious one. Out of all the films the two made in the eighties, Stallones movies were more, for a better word, real, than Arnies alien, cyborg, rekall type stuff.Arnie on the other hand is having a ball in his role, which is nothing more than creating diversions for Stallone by going up to someone and criticising their mother, several times over.Add a generic Vinnie Jones as the main henchman, and Caviezel doing his best Alan Rickman impression, and you get the movie fanboys have been waiting for for a long, long time.For some, including myself, this movie is the equivalent of the coffee shop scene in 'Heat', not in quality, for sure, just for the whole nostalgia thing.If you are not a fan of the two actors, this will be just another generic action movie, but for people who have had these two stars in their movie going life since the eighties, this is something special, and thankfully, its as good as you would expected it to be.Plus it could open Arnie up to a new franchise.

When the ""maximum security"" prison mostly holds the people in the same place, where glasses and pens and other utensils are readily available, never checking if they have anything on them, when the warden is an impotent power-high ass with a violent and out of control henchman... well, it all sours things.If you can get over that and the completely predictable plot, you will enjoy at least the cast.

That alone is worth the price of admission. And the duo just works well together, as these badass prisoners trying to make a escape. The main scene stealer is Arnie, who is the main comic relief while being a badass. Maybe it's because it's been a while since he made a screen presence. But his trademark parts are just flat out sweet. Despite the duo's old age, they are still beast. Jim Caviezel plays the neat villainous character well, nothing standout but does well with what he is given.

Using his survival skills and what he knows about prison structures, Breslin attempts to escape, along with enigmatic inmate Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger), and find the perpetrator who put him behind bars.Stallone and Schwarzenegger make a great team together and prove that their star quality is interminable after decades in filmmaking and prove they can still kick some major butt. Their on screen drama and character substance are also essential to watch and to the overall plot of the story, which I thought is one of a few original pieces of work Hollywood dished out this decade (2010s).The film starts off with some nice action in the beginning, then drags somewhat in the middle, and then comes to a knocking climax; therefore, you get a mixture of excitement and boredom. You also get a mixture of some decent acting to some really forced corny moments. But overall, it's not a bad action film.Grade B-",Escape Plan
30,Hellmant,Left me longing for the films of yesteryear.,7,21 October 2013,"'ESCAPE PLAN': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger team together for the first time on the big screen (in lead roles that is, excluding Arnold's cameos in the 'THE EXPENDABLES' films). Mikael Hafstrom (who's also directed suspense thrillers like '1408', 'THE RITE' and 'DERAILED') directed the film and Miles Chapman and Jason Keller wrote it. The film has Stallone playing a 'structural security' expert who breaks out of prisons for a living (in order to test their security). He's setup and left in the world's most secret and complex prison without aid from the outside. Schwarzenneger co-stars as another prisoner who helps him plan an escape. The film is slow paced and not too thrilling but seeing Stallone and Schwarzenegger together is worth it. The movie also features supporting turns from Jim Caviezel, Amy Ryan, Sam Neil, Vincent D'Onofrio, 50 Cent, Vinnie Jones and Faran Tahir. Stallone plays Ray Breslin, the best structural security expert in the world. His job is finding weaknesses in prisons, by escaping from them, so they can improve their security and make them 'escape-proof'. He works with three others who help him from the outside: Abigail (Ryan), Hush (50 Cent) and Lester Clark (D'Onofrio). Breslin and Clark co-own the business together. Ray takes an assignment from a CIA agent, Jessica Miller (Caitriona Balfe), to test a secret prison and poses as a terrorist named Portos. His captors drug him and remove a tracking microchip from his shoulder so his teammates have no idea where he is. Once inside the prison he meets Emil Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger) and the two plan an escape together. I had been dreaming of a big screen action movie pairing of Schwarzenegger and Stallone since I was a kid, so I was eager to see this, but it doesn't live up to what I had hoped for. It's definitely not a bad film and it is reminiscent of the type of action films Stallone used to make in the 80s and 90s but he and Schwarzenegger have definitely done better and the two together definitely deserve something bigger and more thrilling. Still it is great to see them both, together, and they're good in the film (Schwarzenegger is especially funny and fun to watch). It doesn't live up to it's potential but it is fun and nostalgic. It left me longing for the films of yesteryear but it definitely wasn't the worst way to spend a couple hours.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV24sbHK5H0",Escape Plan
31,thesar-2,Prison Broken,4,29 January 2014,"A ""Plan B"" was talked about in the movie, but the producers failed to come up with one when Escape Plan was released.Like the Grindhouse revival, Stallone has been trying to revive the 1980/1990s Action Heroes and with some success. Unfortunately here and while not a complete dud, he failed. Heck, had this been released in 1990, we would've said ""eh,"" and now I look more forward to the Terminator sequel!Master escape planist Ray has hacked his way out of the most secured prisons around, but he met his match during his latest ""outing."" Without the aid from the outside and with the friendship with said Terminator, he might be able get out of this fine mess.Most of the films Stallone wants to bring back to the next gen have similar and thin plots, but the comedy and homage make them special. Sadly, no humor is found here, nor much homage. Just a bunch of set up, more talking and the less admirable clichés are overly used.Also, the movie ""stars"" 50 cent, which I wouldn't have recognized had I not recently saw him in Last Vegas. Mercifully for that movie, he was in it for about 50 seconds (or less.) In Escape Plan, he much more screen time and not only are those frames worth less than 2 quarters, but I sincerely hope I don't see him in any more movies.The rest of the secondary cast, Amy Ryan, Faran Tahir, Sam Neill and definitely Jim Caviezel were all so plain, lifeless and cardboard and without the fun irony/homage to the clichéd movies of decades past. None of them had fun here, nor did we.While not a waste, it wasn't worth the almost two hour running time just to get the two titans (Stallone/Schwarzenegger) together. It did have its moments, but not enough to avoid all together and just wait patiently for Expendables 3.* * * Final thoughts: 50 Centshut that mouth.

33,Robert_duder,Absolute perfection. No more and no less than what it offers...sheer entertainment,9,21 October 2013,"This was probably one of my most anticipated films of the year. When I heard about the project, my eyes were wide with excitement, when I saw the first trailer I squealed like a fan-girl...Why? Stallone and Schwarzenegger are my movie idols. They were who I turned to when I first fell in love with films. I grew up with them like so many of you did and watching them on the big screen amps up my expectations 20 fold. So the two of them together for the first time in starring roles was a dream come true. But how would it be? I actually LOVED The Last Stand, and both Expendables movies while Bullet To The Head was pretty much a disaster. Escape Plan is EXACTLY what you could expect and want from it. It was their best movie in probably a decade not including Expendables. Now don't start your rage meters ticking...I am not a low intelligence moron...I want everything from foreign to romance to this sort of fare. This is a guilty pleasure that CAN be done right and Escape Plan does it perfectly!! The story is well written, with only very minor plot holes (there are guaranteed to be some in an action film but a talented writer/director can make you want to ignore them.) Its a smart story without trying to be too complex which action films can often attempt and fail at. It also had a great pacing that some might actually find slow but the idea is that the filmmakers had a story to tell and didn't want to sacrifice any of that to harsh edits or cuts in favour of blowing stuff up. Its really 80% thriller and 20% action when you look at it.Sylvester Stallone is truly at full form as Ray Breslin, a man who has made his mark by professionally breaking out of prisons to check for security protocols. He finds himself buried in a prison built by his design with no chance of returning home. Stallone's Breslin is not unlike many of his other characters but sometimes that's what we want as Stallone fans. This character is brilliant and evasive and scans everything when he enters a room or area. As Schwarzenegger quips at one point ""You don't look that smart."" Arnold Schwarzenegger finally shows up almost exactly at the 40 minute mark and I was a little disappointed because I thought that would mean he'd be underused showing up a third into the film. Well rest easy friends because he is a major player in the film and makes up for an early absence. At first, I thought his character was almost downright annoying. He follows Stallone like a puppy dog (without reason or explanation) asking him a million questions...annnd then the story unfolded. His character was excellent...maybe one of his best. The scene with him in the ""hot box"" ranting in German was absolutely brilliant. Their chemistry together was perfect...they absolutely have on screen chemistry together and it worked so well. This film is NOT a comedy and is actually pretty gritty and dark but Schwarzenegger provides most of the comedy and one liners but he makes it work. It doesn't feel out of place and its well written. The humour is used perfectly and just the right amount to create a little break in the story. I am shocked to read so many reviews that call out how much they dislike Jim Caviezel as the villainous Warden. I would ask these people have they ever watched a great action film? Because usually the villain is over the top, quirky, outrageous...and I thought Caviezel was amazing. He was emotionless, creepy, cruel and perfect for the part. I also judge a great action film by how the villain meets his end and this was a huge A+ with the perfect remark from him that coined his character very well. Faran Tahir has a small but important and very effective role as an inmate who eventually joins them on the escape. He quickly wins you over and has you rooting for him too and gets one of the more bad-ass moments in the film. The supporting cast range from good to okay including a welcomed cameo from Sam Neill, Curtis Jackson (who I actually thought did a solid job in a small part), Amy Ryan (very underused but they don't push the romance angle which is good), Vinnie Jones as the lead henchman (the obvious role for him and he does fine at it) and Vincent D'Onofrio as Stallone's backstabbing business partner and pseudo-villain.Mikael Håfström has had a varied career and done alright in the past. I think he really nailed directing this one. If you ignore a couple of horrible and pointless completely CGI long shots that were incredibly unnecessary he does a great job capturing the gritty realism of this masterpiece prison. The twists and turns to the story were solid right up and including the neat little twist ending that actually made a lot of sense and suited the story well. I don't think anyone could go into this with wrong expectations. Its Stallone and Schwarzenegger doing what they have always done best. The thing you might not expect is how good the story really is and keeps you riveted. The last half hour of the film will then satisfy your sheer bloody action quota and then some. This is a great popcorn flick so go see it and enjoy it because how many years of these classic old school action flicks do we have left. This was a big hit for me. 9/10",Escape Plan
34,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Too little, too late pairing of the ultimate action icons of the last half a century",4,20 October 2013,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Morning * Monday MorningRay Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) works for the government, being placed in federal prisons and exposing weaknesses in their security, by staging audacious, carefully planned breakouts. But now he finds his services requested by the private sector, to infiltrate a recently built, state of the art Guantanamo Bay style prison where rendition suspects and those set up to be there are sent. However, it doesn't work out how he thought and he finds himself hauled there under different circumstances. There, he meets fellow convict Rottmayer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who Warden Hobbes (Jim Caviezel) is pressing to disclose the location of a wanted man. Together, they must find their way out and get to the truth.It stands to reason that if people work together instead of against each other, they can get much better results. In the '80s and into the '90s, Arnie and Sly were the names in action cinema, each seemingly trying to usurp each other with each successive new release they both churned out, but each producing the same kind of box office success. It would have stood to reason that at the height of their fame was the best time to have made a collaborative effort together, though maybe personal egos would have got in the way of who got first billing, so instead were seemingly content to open restaurant chains together and be best remembered for that. Now, a good fifteen/twenty years or so after they were really big, their on screen pairing arrives with a sense of under- whelming that wouldn't have been there back then. Now both in their late sixties, the impression is sadly not dissimilar to the long awaited Al Pacino/Robert De Niro pairing Righteous Kill, a bit of a missed opportunity that is not a complete failure but just quite under whelming and unfulfilling.The script just goes through the motions, feeling like a bit of a prison sentence in itself, long and drawn out with a weary pace that doesn't do justice to some of the more explosive, exciting action interludes and snazzy production design. All the clichés of the genre are included for all and sundry, predictably written and monotone to boot. As for the lead actors, Sly mumbles and grunts his way through things as he usually does, while Arnie tries to bring his usual trademark deadpan humour and one liners to the proceedings, but his enthusiasm just doesn't reach it's potential. Sam Neill makes a surprise appearance as the prison doctor, while other supporting players Vinnie Jones and 50 Cent take a break from making straight to DVD action clunkers to appear in something a little more up market.Simple and unpretentious though it is, Escape Plan just feels like a misplaced title. Retirement Plan might feel better suited to these guys. **",Escape Plan
35,bowmanblue,Old school action,8,2 July 2014,"It's been amazing that these two – Sly and Arnie – have never got together on screen before (excluding the cameos in The Expendables movies), as they do work rather well together.It focuses on the two men's attempts to escape a futuristic prison which has been custom- built to prevent escapes. Guess what it's about to be put to its limits. So, baring in mind that the story takes place in a prison, there's plenty of faceless thugs for our two action heroes to pound, plus a villainous warden and his henchman Vinnie Jones to sort out along the way.This is Sly's movie, so he does get more screen time and people to punch than Arnie, so Arnie fans may feel just a little short-changed. However, seeing as the two actors have known each other for many years, there's a natural rapport between them which shines out. Arnie's acting (yes, acting!) seems to have suffered since being in politics, seeming a bit stilted in The Last Stand and The Expendables, but he seems to be regaining his old late eighties/early nineties charm.If you like either or both the aging escape-artists, you should enjoy this film, even if it's just to watch them on screen (properly) for the first time. There's your typical amount of action and mayhem as they figure out how to break out. My only gripe was that it was a little longer than I expected, clocking in at nearly two hours. Shave about 10-15 minutes off the runtime and you'd have a much tighter movie.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Escape Plan
36,MLDinTN,better than expected,7,24 August 2014,"I think Stallone and Schwarzenegger turned in two admirable performances in this film, much better than their recent attempts.Stallone, plays Ray, a guy that gets paid to escape prisons and find loop holes in security. He accepts a big challenge for a large paycheck, but soon realizes he's the one that's been scammed. Someone wanted him to be locked up in a unknown prison that seems impossible to escape. He teams up with fellow prisoner, Rottmayer, and they crack the seemingly impossible.FINAL VERDICT: I found it to be suspenseful and I just like when the ""hero"" finds a way to succeed when it seems highly unlikely. And I liked the way it's done in this movie. I recommend it for any action fans.",Escape Plan
37,g-bodyl,Don't Forget Your Popcorn!,9,23 December 2014,"Escape Plan is one hell of a ride from start to finish. After all these years, we finally get to see two action legends be on screen in leading roles for the first time in their history. People blast this film for being generic, but I say so what? I did not watch the film because of the plot, but more so I can see Sly and Arnold in action and they did not disappoint. It just so happens that I like movies set in prisons so the plot did entice me after all.Speaking of plots, this film is based around a man named Ray Breslin who is the world's renowned expert on prison security and he breaks out of prison for a living. But after he is framed and sent to the world's most secure and isolated prison for good led by a sadistic warden named Hobbes, Breslin recruits the help of fellow inmate named Swan and together they must achieve the impossible.It's still nice to see Stallone and Schwarzenegger kick some butt as they both near the age of seventy. Sure botox or steroids may help to a degree, but they both bring a sense of nostalgia to the film. They do a very good and they show great chemistry. My favorite scene involves Arnold being sent to the ""hotbox"" where he curses then warden out in German. Speaking of warden, Jim Caviezel is excellent. We don't see much of him these days, but he makes for one tough meanie. Same goes for Vinnie Jones as his top henchman.Overall, Escape Plan is a very fun movie and for fans of 80's/90's action thrillers, you will not be disappointed. This film is like a modern day version of the Shawshank Redemption and that is a good comparison to have. The plot is nothing new and the screenplay is not anything special, but it's nice to have a modern retelling of this kind of story. It is meant to be a fun movie and it succeeds. It's better than Sly's and Arnold's other 2013 efforts: Bullet to the Head and the Last Stand. I rate this film 9/10.",Escape Plan

39,lesleyharris30,"A Generic Waste of Time,",2,28 August 2016,"Escape Plan is a horrendous movie with a very poorly developed plot that made no effort of being original or unique whatsoever, as well as a talented cast that embarrass themselves by delivering extremely poor dialogue. It is simply a generic, typical prison escape movie that does absolutely everything by the numbers, there is not one moment that is inspired, not one piece of dialogue that is original (the likes of ""we gotta bust outta here"" and ""didn't see that coming"" can be expected). I am a big fan of both Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger, them being the reason why I decided to watch it in the first place, but their charisma and likable personas are simply not enough to save this film. I spent the whole time feeling sorry for them for giving so much of their time on such a poor production. Not even the editing is impressive, the pacing and tone is all over the place and there is a lot of moments that were very clearly additional audio recording, not one bit subtle or professional in hiding that. Predictable, lackluster and uninspired, Escape Plan falls flat merely because it is not one bit original. A man who exposes prison security flaws gets trapped in jail himself, and must devise a plan to break out. Best Performance: Arnold Schwarzenegger / Worst Performance: Vincent D'Onofrio",Escape Plan

Everyone.But prisons became dull and boring in the new hi-tech environment and the genre died out.Credit Sly for finding a really good script and a really good lead character. The success of these films depends on the hero being sympatico and the tech being daunting.Extra bonuses are a warden you want to take a swing at yourself and Arnie WHO GIVES HANDS DOWN THE BEST PERFORMANCE OF HIS CAREER in this seemingly B actioner.The suspense builds.

Others are disappointing. This one falls in the third category, exactly what you expect. That isn't to say this is a bad movie at all because I did like it and was entertained but a movie starring Stallone and Schwarzenegger does have limitations. The one thing I will say about Stallone is he knows his limitations and embraces them, you won't see him take on Shakespeare or even a real heavy drama. What he does make are fast moving action movie with a lot of fights and explosions. While not Oscar contenders movies like that are needed and he fills the void.

The story is good, but overall execution is unfortunately not really satisfying. it has good moments, but they are far and between. The acting is OK, especially by both leads.

44,tabuno,An enjoyable bringing together of two action stars,7,28 January 2019,"This movie brings together two action blockbuster stars, Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger into a crime action thriller where Stallone's character as a topflight security expert finds himself in a privately own blacksite housing supposedly housing some of the notorious criminals and terrorists that is virtually escape proof. While a decent movie and bewilderingly a Razzie nomination for Stallone, the movie's beginning scenes seems to be rather tame as well as the lower energy intensity compared to such action thrillers like Spy Game (2001) or Enemy of the State (1998). Escape Plan has some elements of physical and emotional suffering that echoes Stallone's classic movie in Rocky (1976) along with some escape scenes from disaster movie The Poseidon Adventure (1972). The movie seems to suffer from the casting of Jim Caviezel of the television series Person of Interest (2011-2016). Caviezel is a delight actor in his television series, but his ability to portray a scary administrator in charge of a horrid blacksite is pretty lame, almost miscast. However, one of the most entertaining shots is one later in the movie where Jim Caviezel's character Hobbes smirks. Another familiar actor, Sam Neill, as a medical doctor is undeveloped and never gets to really shine in the movie. As for Vincent D'Onofrio as Stallone's partner, his persona might have been better cast in Caviezel's role.The storyline outline and the technical aspects of jail breaks are interesting. The moody and almost suffocating atmosphere of captivity is powerful for a while. Yet there's something about even Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance that seems too entertainingly enjoyable for this supposedly more dark and dismal setting. Spy Game with puts Brad Pitt's undercover character in a Chinese prison offers up the more disturbing but more effective and appealing drama rather than the more almost light-hearted camaraderie between the lead actors. Overall, this action drama eventually becomes a predictable and typical movie that casts two aging but still enjoyable brand actors together.",Escape Plan
45,The-Sarkologist,Sly and Arnie are finally starring in a movie together,7,30 August 2014,"Well, finally they have made a movie where two of the big action heroes of the 80s, Stallone and Schwarzenegger, team up together. As I come to think about it I am not surprised that it has taken this long (though I believe they also team up in The Expendables, but since there are a lot of other action heroes in that film that doesn't count – with Escape Plan they are the main focus) because, ignoring the fact that Schwarzenegger spent some time as the Governator, back in their hey day they had enough drawing power on their own and did not need to team up. In fact what we may end up discovering is that it can be quite difficult having two big names in a film because both of them want the lime light and it can cause no end of frustrations for the film makers. However, now that these two are probably coming to the end of their acting careers bringing them together probably helps both of them (especially since this film went straight to DVD in Australia).Anyway, Sly plays a guy whose job is to test the security of various prisons, and he does that by getting locked up and then looking for way to escape. He is then approached by the CIA to help them test out a secret and secure facility that is used to hold the world's most dangerous people, off the radar and out of mind, out of sight. However it doesn't just sit as a simple escape from prison type movie (though escaping from this inescapable prison is the major part of this film) because there are a few other things that come to light as the film progresses (which I am not going to share with you because, well, this is a pretty cool movie, though not one that I would watch again and again).I wouldn't necessarily say that the end was one of those mindblowing twisted endings like The Usual Suspects, though it does have a few ahh moments (such as when you discover the location of the prison, or the whole reason behind why Sly is sent into the prison in the first place). Other than that this is what somebody described as a 'standard 1980's popcorn action film'. Once the movie gets started it is quite clear who the main bad guy is (I can say that it is the warden, because, well, if it is a prison break movie then it goes without saying that the warden, and his henchman, are going to be the main bad guys), and it does keep you glued to the end, but then again it is not one of those films that you are going to regularly come back to watch (there are plenty of other films that fall into that category).",Escape Plan
46,slightlymad22,30 Years Too Late,7,6 July 2016,"Continuing my plan to watch every Sly movie in order, I come to Escape Plan.Plot In A Paragraph: Ray Breslin (Sly) is the world's foremost authority on structural security. His skills are put to the test. When he is incarcerated in an escape proof, master prison he designed himself. Like with Sly teaming up with Burt Reynolds, I had been waiting for years for a real team up between Sly and Arnie. Sly is OK here, but it's Arnie who delivers his best work in years!! I think everyone knows what scene I am talking about. When he is crammed up in the sweat box ranting in Austrian. It is some of his best work. But he does not turn up for 31 minutes. Of the supporting cast 50 Cent is OK, Sam Neil is just sort of there, Vinny Jones plays the type of role you expect him too (I actually forgot he was in it) and Jim Caviezel is pretty forgettable too. The director Mikael Hafstrom (who I had to look up because I couldn't remember who directed it) does a fine job, but he was never going to win or lose directing this movie!! If it's a huge hit, it's because it was the first real team up between Sly and Arnie. If it flops, the blame falls with Sly and Arnie.I think most people who think of Sly and Arnie fondly will enjoy Escape Plan. I defiantly think it is more popular with older fans than younger, as while both of my kids (10 and 17) said it was OK, neither has cared to revisit it. It's not in keeping with the style of action that youngsters like today, in such movies like Fast & the Furious etc, and it's not old school action either. But it is close.Like with Bullet To The Head, it's almost 30 years too late. If this had been released in between 1985-1995 it would have been amongst the highest grossing movies of the year. As it was, it struggled to make a dent at the Domestic Box Office. Grossing only $25 million, Escape Plan was not in the years Top 100 Highest Grossing Movies. How on earth that happened is beyond me. It's certainly better than Scary Movie V and The Delivery Man with Vince Vaughn and After Earth which made the list. It's certainly better than Die Hard V which grossed $67 million.",Escape Plan
47,Reno-Rangan,Star value saved the movie,8,7 February 2014,"The content wise it is the same movie to all prison break theme, but the characters were a bit modified. The new fashion in today's cinema is the twist at the opening as well at the end. So this movie had one like that in both the portions.If you are a Schwarzenegger fan, you would disappoint a bit because the Stallone rules whole show. I can say it was fairly balanced screenspace only due to the capacity wise. Capacity comes under strength factor, so Stallone had the upper hand and does justice. Schwarzenegger looked better than his last movie, especially with less wrinkles in his face.Good cast and good idea but lack of good stunt sequences and intelligent scenes. In a couple of scenes they show Stallone like vision Sherlock Holme had about the 3 dimensional structure of the surrounds. It has been just imitated not the original. The Islamic character in the movie as well included due to one reason and that is to find the position of their location. Otherwise the alliance would have been only between Stallone and Schwarzenegger. That is why I was not surprised by the elimination of that character.As the movie had great actors it was a little let down. Entertainment is guaranteed but visually not spectacular. Expected a better execution from the Swedish director. I believe he did not get a better crew except two iconic stars. It had a good commercial success, but won't remain in people's mind for a very long. If you are a fan of one of these actors you would have a good time, but for others it is one time watch and forgettable.7.5/10",Escape Plan
48,zkonedog,Knows Its Audience And Delivers The Goods,5,4 March 2017,"Reviewing a film like ""Escape Plan"" is actually easier than it seems. If you are a fan of Sly/Arnie fare, then you will love its action and semblance of plot. If not, it will be just so-so.For a basic plot summary, ""Escape Plan"" tells the story of Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone), a man who literally wrote the book on escaping from prisons around the nation! When the CIA gives him a nearly impossible assignment, however, Breslin finds out that he is in for the jail-break of his life. Along the way, he meets up with fellow inmate Rottmayer (Arnold Schwarzenegger), who helps him try to overcome the rather sadistic Warden Hobbes (Jim Caviezel).""Escape Plan"" is an action film, first and foremost, filled with fistfights, tough-guy stand-offs, shoot-em-up sequences, and some tongue-in-cheek jocularity. It moves along at a fast pace and only slows down to set up the next break-neck scene.That being said, there is one factor that makes this movie watchable (as opposed to previous efforts from Sly/Arnie in ""Bullet To The Head"" and ""The Last Stand"") for those who don't like the pulse-pounding stuff all the time: it does have a kernel of a decent plot. Breslin's experience with prisons makes for some interesting subject matter. Personally, I think the film would have been better served by focusing more on those areas and less on the machismo, but that isn't what director Mikael Hafstrom set out to do (instead, he is making a pretty straightforward action picture).Also, the acting in this flick is better than I expected, especially from Arnold. While a few ""wink, wink"" moments to the ""glory days of the 1980s"" exist, this isn't a schlock-fest like ""The Expendables"" franchise sometimes turns into (for better or worse). Instead, most of the acting is ""played straight"" and to well accord.Overall, ""Escape Plan"" is a step in the right direction for the Arnie/Sly pair. While this is a very predictable, ""safe"" genre for them, it constitutes each actor's best role since the pre- Expendables days. The ""built in"" fans will lap it up with multiple viewings, while the newcomers will tolerate the action-first mentality as mitigated by the prison-break aspects.",Escape Plan

With 1408's Mikael Hafstrom attached as director it surely meant a good popcorn munching time at the movies right? To answer that now you can only answer yes and also sadly at times no.Escape Plan is a movie that would have benefited from a more streamlined plot, at the centre of the story we have all the elements for a ripping yarn yet the film throws in far too many side plots for a story that didn't need them. Escape Plan works best when the pure adrenaline rush of the excitement of an escape or even the planning of escape is allowed to play out in old school entertaining fashion. The basic idea of a high tech futuristic prison is also an element that whilst extremely cool isn't really allowed to flourish within the movie, you get the sense there is a whole world within the confinements that are just waiting to be explored. All this while meaning something isn't the crux of the film for what you pay money to see is Arnie and Sly teaming up and on this front the film delivers.Sylvester Stallone has for a long while now been muttering his way through mediocre movies with not much charm and Escape Plan doesn't do much to change this The Governator however shows us all that he still hasn't lost an ounce of his charm after sitting in office for all those years. Looking fit and with a whip smart attitude still at the forefront once Arnie makes his way on screen about 30 minutes in the film really gets going and suffers when the focus goes back to Sly. Other actors in the piece from Amy Ryan through to Sam Neill all suffer with underwritten roles while Jim Caviezel hams it up more than a bacon convention therefore not adding anything memorable to proceedings.With enough scenes of interplay between Sly and Arnie and with a core story that possess the B grade goodness we at times desire Escape Plan is a good entertaining piece of filmmaking and a throwback to the 80's that is easy on the mind and easy to enjoy. You get the sense that the movie could have been a whole lot more had its story remained less complicated and slightly less predictable but you get to see Arnie dismount and shoot an LMG machine gun so who really cares about such things? 3 makeshift sextants out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Escape Plan

It's good to see Arnie and Sly finally work side by side in this action packed thriller about Sly breaking out of prisons for a living. The storyline was very thought through and the script was well put together. It's full of wit and intense drama throughout the movie which made it a joy to watch. Don't get me wrong, we have seen Sly and Arnie play these type of roles many times before, but watching there chemistry with each other was well worth the wait. The movie is much better than the Expendables franchise because there is actually some thought behind the storyline and Arnie is on form. Enjoyable!Round-Up: This movie has many different twists and turns and you really don't know were it's going to end up. Arnie stole the screen with his wit and funny jokes and Sly was his same old hero figure that kicks butt throughout the movie. The actual prison was well put together and the director use a lot of attention to detail. The storyline is original and a whole different twist on a prison escape movie. I personally was expecting an average action movie so I was glad with the outcome. I hope that it didn't make that amount of money just based on the names in the cast because it's a good watch.Budget: $50million Worldwide Gross: $138millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there prison break movies with loads of action and intense drama. 7/10",Escape Plan

The duelling juggernauts of 80s action. An impenetrable maximum security facility monolithically stands in their way, preventing them from being reliable gym buddies and exercising those lucrative vein-inducing steroids. Will Arnie ""be back""? Is Stallone still missing ""Adriaaaaan!""Regardless of the nostalgic fuel that pumps through Håfström's reunion, it's unfortunately weighed down by an implausibly ridiculous plot that believes itself to be smarter than it actually is, diminishing the non-sensical fun in the process. Best get ""back to da choppa!"" ey Arnie? (Or governor of California...). An escape artist, hired independently to test maximum security facilities by breaking out of them, is setup by his own financial advisor and incarcerated in the most secure prison of them all.Soldiers, probably ex-military, walking around with black 'V for Vendetta' masks scaring up the prisoners who just want to sleep. Schwarzenegger delivering some excruciatingly brilliant one liners as per usual. ""You fight like a vegetarian!"". Stallone, probably extremely interested and involved, looking generally fatigued and uncharismatic. Water hoses shoved down the throats of prisoners, whilst locked in steel boxes (crucial point...) with the brightest and hottest lamps beating down upon them. Palaeontologist Dr. Alan Grant recovering from the trauma of 'Jurassic Park III', by medically assisting America's most dangerous criminals. And Vinnie ""I'm the Juggernaut!"" Jones putting the ""cock"" in ""cockney"". Suffice to say, it's a paradise. A beautiful holiday retreat. If only the plot was just as idyllic.Essentially, Escape Plan fundamentally works due to Stallone and Schwarzenegger's chemistry. Divert away from this, and plot conveniences, holes and illogicality rapidly take precedent. Ray is described to be the ultimate escape artist, which is essentially a cop out description for his character to do literally anything and consider it to be objective fact. Example: using broken glasses, paper and other utensils to blindly craft an apparatus that aligns with the moon to determine the equatorial alignment of one's current location. Perhaps this is a legitimate tool that can be created under a prison table. I don't know. Nor do I care. My point is, due to the prison being ""the most secure facility in existence"", the actual escape plan requires the audience to promptly suspend their disbelief.The brawls and action are few and far between, resulting in the remaining hour and half to be weirdly edited conversations where the camera manages to go through Stallone's eye on multiple occasions. In fact the entire editing, from quick cuts to weird scene transitions that remind me of Microsoft PowerPoint fade out animations, decreased the quality of the general filmmaking. Not to mention the obvious green screen and dreadfully unnecessary moments of CGI.At the end of the gloomy day, you probably wanted to watch this just for Stallone and Schwarzenegger, in which case you'll be satisfied. You just have to endure the mountainous implausibilities, overextended runtime and underwhelming conclusion. Had it been made thirty years ago, could've been good.

Well maybe if this movie would have been made in the 70's rather than in 2013, there may have been a bit more action and a little bit less reliance on a suspenseful musical score and a story line that was pretty simple.I enjoy a film that has stars that just pop with a fresh character portrayal and bravado, and based on this film, I think both Stallone and Schwarzenegger are well past their BEST BEFORE freshness date.The story line evolves around a professional escape artist (Sylvester Stallone) who is hired by the government to identify any weaknesses in the prisons that he is deliberately incarcerated in under an alias. Of course he is always able to break out of the prisons he is sent to and identify some significant flaws in the prisons security system(s), so the investors and architects of the super secure prisons felt it was time to put Sylvester behind bars permanently to shut him up for good and teach this Houdini a lesson he was never expecting, life in prison without parole.Arnold plays a prisoner who befriends Sylvester and who wants to break out with him when the opportunity presents itself. The Warden of the prison is played by Jim Caviezel. Well of course this action genre needs the standard prison fight scenes, guns a blazing, and a hero who just won't quit.

With a surprise revelation, ten minutes into the start, was something I never saw coming. Why the hell would you want to stay in a prison, undercover, as a security structural adviser, for your moulah. Sly's character does have a personal reason, and indeed, we're minded how he can fight. The new high tech prison, he's assigned to for double the amount, it's security much more tighter, inescapable as we're led to believe, has him framed with him becoming a real prisoner. This gaol is not one that exists on land. It's something of a futuristic one, glass blocks functioning as prison cells. The worst of the worst prisoners are run with a corrupt hand by merciless warden Cavaziel, playing bad brilliantly, and his other monkeys. Vinnie Jones is fun to watch as a gung ho nut, Cavaziel's offsider, though we have the feeling we've seen Jones has played this type of character before. What I found interesting, as intriguing, was Aussie, Sam Neil's character as the prison's doctor, the only one on the level, (think of that Troma film 'Lust For Freedom') as much a prisoner as the others, a great sympathetic human character touch to this original film. It's great to see Sly and Arnie bounce off each other, some of their escape attempts thwarted by Cavaziel, his death as a revenge fan's delight, as also Arnie and Sly's lines during his annihilation. The last ten to fifteen minutes of Escape Plan is action plus. Of course, Sly and Arnie are gonna be upstaged by it's surrounding stars, in the acting stakes, no one better than Cavaziel, in his finest hour, but this isn't a bad starting point for our two leads to kick off their careers again. Hopefully we're gonna see more of them in these type of films, a better take than both of these stars prior ones. Sly's last line is a killer in regards to his girlfriends cooking, that sums up his place through the whole movie. It's so so obvious from the start, Vincent Of'norio's character is corrupt as one of Sly's structural team, it's as patent as a black eye.",Escape Plan
56,Vartiainen,Testosterone cheesecake,5,24 February 2014,"A dual star movie starring the two biggest action superstars of all time, Sylvester ""Southpaw"" Stallone and Arnold ""Austrian Oak"" Schwarzenegger. It has taken decades to have these two sharing screen time as equals. Expendables was close, but in those films Arnold made little more than cameos. This is the real deal and it doesn't disappoint.Escape Plan is simple, solidified fun. The plot is just complex and exotic enough to catch our interest: a man who professionally breaks out of prisons (Stallone) gets locked into the most escape proof prison there is and once there has to befriend a hardened jail veteran (Schwarzenegger) in order to escape. Pure and simple, something that allows for a lot of character moments and cool action scenes. And we end up getting both of those. Schwarzenegger and Stallone are older now than in their glory days, but I'd argue that this actually increases their charm. Especially with Schwarzenegger. He's less cheesy and more refined nowadays after his governor tenure.Furthermore, the actual prison location has some interesting features, the action is very solid and high octane, some of the side characters and plot twists are actually genuinely, if not clever, at least inventive. Probably the film's weakest link is the warden (Jim Caviezel). The man's not a bad actor, it's just that the character kind of drowns when put next to the two main leads. There's a reason why the villains in the movies of these two are usually extremely overacted. It makes them stand out. Sometimes it ended up ruining the film, but sometimes it actually gave us a really memorable bad guy. The warden here is not bad, he's just not very distinctive.But let's be honest here. If you're going to see this film, you're going to see it for Schwarzenegger and Stallone. And the scenes between them are genuinely enjoyable. It's not the best film these two have ever done individually, not even close, but it will serve.",Escape Plan

It's also something that you would expect from Stallone and Schwarzenegger, but also something that you can't guarantee will be in their movies.In this movie, Stallone's character is a man who tests prisons securities. They send him in as a prisoner and see if he can figure out a way to escape. But when he gets sent to the wrong prison, where escape is nearly impossible, he must find a way to get out and find out who set him up. He meets Schwarzenegger's character, a prisoner, and they plan a way to escape. Hence the title, Escape Plan.I think this is a very good movie, with a good concept, that was very executed well, with a great cast and a good ending.Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10.",Escape Plan
59,BeneCumb,Tough and rough - with some credibility shortcomings,7,13 December 2013,"Movies related to prisons, including escapes and riots, have been quite popular in recent decades, thus, some new angle or twist is needed to make a new one distinct from others; clichés are used anyway as (U.S.) prisons have similar conception, security and precautions. Escape Plan does have several unexpected turns, and the use of older (Stallone, Schwarzenegger, D'Onofrio, O'Neill) and middle-aged character actors (Caviezel, Jones) provides this largely male and oppressive movie additional quaintness. The plot is not even, however, and there are some questionable issues, such as why eavesdropping of prisoners was not used with this sophisticated technology? Tensions are still always up, but pre-ending scenes contain typical Stallone-Schwarzenegger chases and shootings - usually entertaining, but a bit out of context for the movie in question. Nevertheless, it is a solid movie, and admirers of the two ""tycoons"" will probably not feel disappointed; in many ways, they are much more interesting and convincing than their much younger counterparts.",Escape Plan

Having reached their prime in many memorable films, they have decided to collaborate on this project called "" Escape Plan "". Drawing on the Miles Chapman story and directed by Mikael Hafsrom, the two men take part in a story which pits Ray Breslin, a renown escape artist against Warden Hobbs (Jim Caviezel), a professional security expert who has mastered Breslin's own book on how to prevent escapes. In addition once inside, Breslin befriends a financial wizard in a friendship with Mr. Rottmayer. To thwart any escape plan from his super maximum prison and to insure than no one is able to help him, Hobbs takes steps, like removing Breslins' implanted location device and changes the code name to have him released. The only link to any possible escape is Dr. Kyrie (Sam Neill) a good humanitarian.

Sylvester plays a prison security expert that goes into prisons and then escapes, pointing out their weaknesses to whomever has hired him. He is so good, he even wrote a book on his experiences and charges large fees for his services.

Vincent plays Sylvester's business partner that handles the negotiations and Jim plays the warden. After Sylvester gets into the prison, he meets Arnold, a fellow prisoner that wants out in the escape, in exchange for helping Sylvester with anything he might need. The only problem is that Jim has read Sylvester's book and fortified his prison, accordingly. There are several actors you should recognize in smaller parts, such as Sylvester's computer expert and the doctor in the prison.

Directed by Mikael Hafstrom (1408, The Rite), Escape Plan had an interesting premise, but the truth of the matter is I was drawn to it because I wanted to see the Italian Stalion and the Governator sharing leading roles for the first time. If this film would've taken place in the 80's or early 90's it would've been a box office hit and an instant classic. I'm sure that I at least would've given this film a much higher rating considering I was a huge fan of these cheesy and brainless shoot-em-up films during the 90's, but now my taste for this genre has cooled down and I found several flaws within the story. Despite those flaws, I still had a great time watching these two legends play off each other sharing some great chemistry and charisma together. My enjoyment of Escape Plan might be influenced by a high degree of nostalgia, but I'd still recommend this film.The screenplay written by Miles Chapman centers on an eminent authority on structural security, Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone), who enters hundreds of prisons as an undercover prisoner and uses his skills to escape from it unveiling its flaws in the process. After accepting his next assignment he's framed and sent to a maximum security prison run by the warden Hobbes (Jim Caviezel) which has been designed based on Ray's own recommendations. Ray teams up with another prisoner named Emit Rottmayer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and together they begin searching for flaws in the system in order to escape, but Hobbes keeps a close watch on them once he realizes who Ray really is. It won't be an easy task, but Ray has managed to find flaws in every system and he will need to do it once more if he wants to leave this place.In general prison break movies appeal to me (I was a huge fan of the first two seasons of Prison Break) so this film presented an interesting premise. There were several flaws and twists that didn't work, but in general I had a good time with this suspenseful thriller (and when I say suspenseful I don't mean it in the way Paul Greengrass delivers tension, but in a much lighter but enjoyable way). The film does reach a point where it begins to feel overlong and a bit ridiculous (mostly around the third act), but I still thought it was worth it and that Arnie stole the show with his usual gags and one liners. The villains were underdeveloped and a bit over the top, but I was still glad to see Caviezel back in an important role. Escape Plan is an entertaining film that will quickly be forgotten, but works as an escapism from a dull and boring day.",Escape Plan

Today it's hardly more than a nostalgia trip. That said, both men still have tremendous charisma and star power, which they bring to bear backed up by a strong supporting cast. Combined with a solid premise, decent script and competent direction, 'Escape Plan' is a moderately entertaining time-waster.The real surprise here is that it's not a 50/50 split for the titans of action. Stallone is clearly the lead, with Schwarzenegger in support. Arnie has looked a bit rusty since coming back to acting, but he's in fine form here. Mixing in some much appreciated humor, he actually steals the show from the more stoic Sly.I really hope both men are able to team up for one last, great movie before hanging up their prop guns.

67,jimbo-53-186511,Enjoyable enough if a little derivative,7,29 January 2020,"Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) is a security expert who earns his crust by breaking out of maximum security prisons in order to expose their security flaws. Following his latest escape, he is offered the opportunity to escape from another 'inescapable prison' - the location is undisclosed, but Breslin is to be rewarded handsomely if successful. Initially sceptical, Breslin accepts, but soon finds that he is being set-up and finds himself in prison for real as someone wants to make sure that he never escapes...Even when this film was released in 2013 the prison escape category of film had already been done several times before; we've had Papillion, Escape from Alcatraz, The Shawshank Redemption and probably more...The good and bad news is that Escape Plan basically offers more of the same without really offer anything new. Interestingly though, I thought Escape Plan shared more in common with the TV Series Prison Break; the way that the inmates exchange conversations and gradually begin to plot their escape just felt very reminiscent of this series - it even has the good doctor as well!!.What Escape Plan does have though is a sort of fluidity about it and I did enjoy the way the story unfolded; the gradual bonding and friendship that grew between the main escapees and the way that the whole picture felt like a jigsaw puzzle; i.e all the pieces are there to necessitate the escape, but they just have to figure out what piece goes where in order to complete the puzzle. Despite a lot of the clichés and the been there done that approach it's still a fairly satisfying and involving film.Part of the success lies with Stallone and Schwarzenegger; whilst both are respectable action legends in their own rights they are both surprisingly low-key (most of the film sees them plotting or scheming, but don't worry action fans they do still have a couple of scraps). Whilst many elements of the film are derivative and unoriginal, I did appreciate the film for at least affording Breslin some depth (his reasons for doing what he does are actually quite touching and actually drew me more towards his character).There are a couple of twists at the end and on the whole the film is briskly paced, tightly focused and enjoyable. If you liked the TV Series Prison Break then I suspect you'll enjoy this which effectively should just be called Prison Break; The Movie.",Escape Plan
68,juneebuggy,Pretty much an instant classic,7,3 February 2016,"Old school action thriller with some old school stars (finally) teaming up to break out of prison. This movie is also pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger pairing except maybe fewer one liners and a decent script.The story follows Sly as an incarcerated security expert (he literally wrote the book on prison security) whose last job sees him being sent to ""The Tomb"" a master prison based on of his own design but he's also been set up, imprisoned and disappeared for real. Now with the help of fellow inmate Emil (Arnie) Rottmayer, he must devise a daring, nearly impossible plan to escape as well as eluding the evil warden and his sadistic lead guard.I enjoyed this movie for what it was, although more serious than I expected, I liked the look of the super prison -unique in that respect and I was very surprised by the location of it, didn't see that coming at all. A good story, a few twists, decent supporting cast in bad guy (done so well) Jim Caviezel, evil guard Vinnie Jones and brow beaten prison doctor Sam Neil. Decent action scenes from guys who can't run anymore, Arnie can still fire a machine gun like no one else though. Sly does some tricky water stunts and some hand to hand fight scenes, he gets pretty beat up and tortured here.On that note I'm a huge Sly fan but as well as looking old here he also looks perpetually tired, like he's just about had enough of doing action movies. Arnie on the other hand was hilarious without even trying. I mean who else can make you laugh as they get water boarded?

69,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Simple action fun,7,27 October 2015,"In a time when we're lucky enough to see the return of two action genre titans coming back to star in movies again, we aren't as lucky with the quality of said movies. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone are the two bad boys I'm talking about, and they both seem to be back for another round after a mutual hiatus from breaking bones and unloading clips. Sly had his Expendables franchise, of which the first was the only half decent one (mainly because of Mickey Rourke and Eric Roberts). Arnie released one called Sabotage, which I made it all of ten minutes into before switching it off. Escape Plan, however, sees them team up for equal screen time in a good old fashioned slice of extra aged action cheese, which is actually a whole lot of fun. Where Sabotage seemed to make a clown out of itself in its attempts to be gritty and dangerous, and Expendables was just a chaotic watered down mess, this one resurrects a solid formula and feels like the classic extravaganzas we've come to know these two icons for. Sly plays Ray Breslin, a professional prison breaker who uses his talents to test the durability of America's correctional facilities by going under over and escaping to expose flaws in design. His foxy colleague (Amy Ryan) has the hots for him and wants him to settle down from all that, while all his boss (Vincent Donofrio) sees is dollar signs, especially when the CIA recruits him to try and break out of an insanely top secret hell hole of a prison, reserved for the worst of the worst, terrorists and the like. He's thrown into this pit and brutalized by the icy psychopath of a warden (Jesus Christ it's Jim Caviesel) and his head guard (Vinnie Jones). His only friend seems to be mysterious Emil Rottmeyer (Schwarzenegger) a shady dude with ties to an anti government organization. They form a shaky, awkward bond and attempt to think, punch, shoot, stab and quip their way out of their mutual predicament. It's pure 'switch your brain off fun', and both dudes are totally having a blast, especially Arnie who steals the damn show with a performance that's as energetic as back in... damn I can't remember the last flick he did before his political stint. He's got a priceless mental breakdown sequence that will no doubt be the butt of many a youtube joke in the near future. Sam Neill is a bit underused as the prison doctor but it's nice to see him anywhere, and 50 Cent skulks around for a bit too. Check logic at the door, grab a massive buttery heart attack of a popcorn bag and enjoy this one for what it is: mindless action fun, a barrel full of steam being let off by two badasses that haven't been properly out of the stable in years.",Escape Plan

71,3xHCCH,Escape Artist Faces His Ultimate Test,7,10 October 2013,"I was so prepared not to like ""Escape Plan"" thinking it would be another run of the mill Stallone action movie. I went in with very low expectations, not knowing anything of the plot. But surprisingly, this film turned out to be very engaging and fun to watch after all. I will not be putting a detailed synopsis for you to be able to enjoy this movie fully as well.Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) is a Houdini of jails, having the ability to escape even the highest of high security enclosures. He finds himself locked up in an unofficial facility whose problematic inmates are meant to ""disappear"". In the advanced, high tech and isolated prison, Breslin's escape skills are put to the ultimate test. Sylvester Stallone still delivers his lines as garbled as ever, but he looks good for his age, and has not lost his charisma as an action star. He managed to be quite credible in playing such an incredibly-skilled individual. We are ready to suspend disbelief and accept that he can do the impossible. Hey, that is Stallone on that screen!Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a German inmate named Rottmeyer, who befriends Breslin. Arnie plays it light here, with his acting so typically awkward and actually funny, but we know and love him in this tongue-in-cheek style of his. Jim Caviezel is intense as Hobbes, the warden of this special prison, as well as its proud designer. He will go to all extremes to prove that his prison is escape-proof. His career seemed to have taken a dip after ""Passion of the Christ"" and that is unbelievable after the limits he pushed with that memorably emotional performance. He is very good here despite being in a rather one-dimensional antagonist role.It was very good to see Sam Neill on screen again, also after what seems to be a long absence. He plays the prison physician here faced with a moral dilemma.The story telling by Swedish-born director Mikael Håfström is well-paced and actually quite exciting. The set design of the prison was very high- tech, and well thought of. That version of solitary confinement was harsh! The escape techniques seemed logically planned and thrillingly executed. The revelation scenes are very well-staged and that is only how far I'm going to describe them so you won't be spoiled with the many surprises this film has in store for you. Recommended for those looking for a good, entertaining and unexpectedly smart action film. You may think you already know how it all ends, but the road it took to get to that ending is quite an enjoyable ride, despite those typically hokey gunfight scenes towards the end.

Both screen vets do well here and work great together. Being friends and working in the same industry as top stars probably made their on screen chemistry easier. Escape Plan brings to mind Escape From Alcatraz, for genre and tone. Escape Plan is much more high tech, modern and slighty more action driven.When casting Arnold and Sly having action is a must, which the viewer will find plenty of here. There is also a good story, suspense, plot twists and the opportunity for Arnold and Sly to play intelligent and intense characters. Director Mikael Hafstom balanced the action and drama well. The set designs for the prison serve the story well and are unique to other prison films. I like Vinny Jones as the heavy and Jim Cavizel did fine as the warden. The great Sam Neil is cast as the doctor,however I would have preferred if him and Jim Cavizel switched parts as Sam Neil is one of my favorite screen villains. I like many am a huge fan of Arnold and Sly and grew up watching their movies. I must say I was not let down here and recommend this movie to almost anybody.",Escape Plan
74,peterp-450-298716,Clash of two titans ...,7,12 February 2014,"He he. You hit like a vegetarian! Now this was a movie to sit back and enjoy watching two old action veterans doing it all over again. Who thought these two gentlemen would be completely extinguished and only live on their well-deserved reputation of the past, was definitely wrong. Forget ""The Expendables"", ""The Last Stand"" and ""Bullet to the head"", and don't assume that this movie is comparable. Stallone and Schwarzenegger once again prove that they are still able to present a movie that's entertaining, action-packed and dressed with a touch of humor. There is even a glimpse of a story. How is that possible ! Obviously you can see that some years have passed after they have been rolling their biceps frightfully in ""Conan"" and ""Rambo"". But they still look tough enough and are able to kick some butt.Admittedly the topic ""Escaping from a prison"" isn't very original. The fact that Ray Breslin (Sly) is an expert in this field and volunteers to be locked into such facilities to find the weaknesses and always manages to escape , I found a brilliant idea. The ultimate test he has to take is on an unknown place for his team and turns out to be a hard mission to deal with . Emil Rottmayer (Arnie) is also locked up in this prison and eventually helps to ensure that Ray can escape and catch the person that set him up in the first place.Stallone plays a convincing role as an expert and I'm sure he kept training hard in all these years since he still looks stunningly muscled. Schwarzenegger also still has rock hard muscles, only his facial features betray his upcoming retirement. To my surprise he tries a rather successful attempt at acting. It's not just a mumbled English with a heavy Austrian accent. No way. Sometimes there are full dialogs, sometimes surprisingly with a comedic twist. The moment he starts whining in his own mother tongue while in the isolation cell, is actually hilarious but also admirable convincing. The scene on the stairs where they make a snapshot made me laugh so hard I almost had tears in my eyes . I repeated that fragment probably five times ! The action part is similar to the better films in which both men have acted and not the dumb violence as used in ""Commando"" or the latest ""Rambo"" movie which apparently was intended to get the score of shot opponents as high as possible. I thought the end was perhaps a bit exaggerated and over the top. But that didn't really bother me at all.The supporting roles weren't that bad either. Jim Caviezel played convincingly the ice-cold prison director Hobbes . Even 50 Cent didn't irritate me this time and wasn't that bad.Are you in for a decent and nicely put together action movie, then ""Escape Plan"" is a must see. It's filled with guaranteed action scenes and humorous one-liners . Sly and Arnie thus prove that they really are the crème de la crème in this genre . Hopefully there will be even more enjoyable movies like this in the future ! More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/",Escape Plan
75,a_chinn,"Sly and Arnold, together at last (sadly ho-hum)",6,12 November 2021,"Muscular, sci-fi version of Samuel Fuller's ""Shock Corridor"" has our hero, security expert and escape artist Sly Stallone, going undercover as a prisoner to blow the whistle on a secret government space prison. The fun really starts when Arnold Schwarzenegger shows up as a fellow inmate who helps Sly escape. Don't expect Fuller's subtle critique of contemporary America in this knuckle-dragging throwback style action flick. Instead, expect a pretty standard prison escape film (in space) that's overlong and takes itself way too seriously. Arnold looks like he's having fun and takes the right tone, but Sly seems to think he's going for an Oscar, which kind of ruins the fun. However despite its faults, the pairing of Stallone and Schwarzenegger really does go a long way, so if you enjoyed their cheesy action flicks of the 80s (i.e. ""Tango & Cash"" or ""Commando"") you'll likely enjoy this geriatric cheesy outing. BONUS FILM PICK: If you want a better space prison action flick, check out the underrated Christopher Lambert film ""Fortress,"" which at one point Arnold was originally set to star.",Escape Plan

It is about a prison escape expert who is double crossed and sent to an escapable prison based on a book he wrote.

78,bobbysing,Disappointing thriller offering quite less than what was promised.,5,9 November 2013,"A prison break or heist plot is always an exciting one full of thrilling, nail-biting and entertaining moments right till the end. So if there is supposed to be a prison break film featuring two of the most famous world heroes Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger together on the screen forming a team. Then there are bound to be loads of expectations and millions of die-hard fans eager enough to watch this rare ensemble at the earliest. The theatrical trailer of ESCAPE PLAN also had many promising scenes & dialogues which further added to the excitement factor a lot and the film did have some great energetic vibes before the release.But unfortunately, the end product fails to meet the expectations raised and all we get to see is a pleasant glimpse of Sylvester and Arnold standing together in a single frame doing nothing significant or great. The pace is pretty slow for an action thriller having such a dream cast and even the fight sequences are not impressive enough as per the standards of the two veterans. Thinking about its basic storyline, ESCPAE PLAN had some great potential, but the writers couldn't exploit it to the best coming up with an easily predictable and mediocre script followed by an average direction by Mikael Hafstrom.In short, in a film revolving around world's greatest prison breaker featuring Stallone and Schwarzenegger together, you don't get to see either any exciting, edge of the seat prison break or any powerful, breathtaking fight sequence presenting them as a team. The film begins promisingly introducing the unique skills of Stallone but then has nothing great to offer in the entire middle hour till the finale (wasting a deadly duo). And that is the reason why even a fast paced climax is not able to make any kind of solid impact on the viewer as it ends. So apart from the two macho heroes standing together on the screen, you don't have much to enjoy or cheer in the film and that should easily give you a clue to take your individual decision of watching it in the theaters or not.",Escape Plan

Maybe if the two leads weren't old men past their prime, or if the script didn't resort to routine action, or anything else that this film tried to do and failed. Escape Plan is a redundant action escape movie where we are to believe that Stallone is some kind of prison escape genius that runs a crew with 50 cent and Amy Ryan. If the film doesn't bore you with its depiction of escaping prisons, the utterly bad performances will. Has Stallone ever acted? Put his performance in this film up against anyone of his previous efforts and try to tell the difference. He dipped his hand in comedy before and took chances, this guy needs to do that again. Playing it safe with his ""resurgence"" is dull. An even worse offender is the Terminator himself. He seems bored here and doesn't try to hide it. Finally we have Jim Caviezel collecting a paycheque and totally checking himself out of a performance. The guy doesn't even try to act here. Even in the face of certain death, his expression never changes. Escape films are suppose to be thrilling, inventive and let the viewer have fun with the escape sequences. This film doesn't do that. We are treated to a shoot em up climax that is dull and uninspired. Where is the creativity? This is the first official team up of Stallone and Schwarzenegger that isn't a glorified cameo (Expendables) yet their chemistry isn't there and they seem to be reaching too far into the past here. Escape Plan wants to be an 80's prison escape film, but doesn't know how. I'd advise you to avoid watching this flick. It'll bore you before you get bored.

He needs to find a way to break out and get the person responsible for his new predicament.When you see that new state-of-the-art prison you will say to yourself, ""how in the world will he get out of this one?"" We see guards with masks who use cattle prods frequently on the prisoners. All cells are made of glass so everyone can see everything. Another problem is that once in this prison, he has no idea where it is and neither does any other prisoner. His people are in the dark, too, as his tracking chip is removed. He needs help. He befriends Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger) and both conspire to find a way out. It would be easy for me to tell you where this prison is, but I want it to be a surprise for you as it was for me. When you see where the prison is you will have the same question I had: how in the world could anyone not know where the prison is? When you see where the prison is you will understand the question. If it doesn't come quickly, give it some time and it will roll up on you. That's a clue, BTW.Other notables who performed well are Sam Neil (the Doctor), 50-Cent (part of Breslin's team), Vincent D""Onofrio (Breslin's partner), Faran Tahir (a prisoner ), and Jim Caviezel (as Hobbes, the Warden). There is a secondary plot regarding Hobbes, who is after the location of Mannheim who is a financial genius who can disrupt the world economy. Hobbes' bosses want to control the world economy. Hobbes believes that Rottmayer knows where Mannheim is and makes a deal with him. This was very enjoyable because of excellent chemistry between these two big stars, who have worked together in the past in THE EXPENDABLES 2 and will again star together in EXPENDABLES 3. How good is that? (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes.",Escape Plan
81,Luigi Di Pilla,Clever action thriller,7,9 June 2014,When I saw the trailer and read some critics I thought this must be worth a watch. I don't regret. I was surprised about the good chemistry between Stallone and Schwarzenegger. It is an intelligent script with many high-tech escape plan elements that developed great suspense. There is a surprisingly happy end that I don't give away here. Finally director Mikael Häfstrom mixed all these ingredients into an entertaining action thriller. I love such movies as The Great Escape or Runaway Train. I will add this DVD to my best of collection. There is no escape: 7/10.,Escape Plan
82,denis888,Very Good Action Flick,7,1 November 2017,"Yes, such tremendous old school starts like Stallone and Schawrzenegger can do anything a molten gold - even this rather usual and modest flick they turned into an exciting jailbreak action thriller thanks to their excellent ensemble and decent delivery. The plot is very trite and very banal to say the least, but it is very well executed and the tension is palpable. Jim Caviezel is also a great choice as a main baddie, as he is elegant, posh, smooth and rather languid, which makes him even more ominous. Sam Neil is a nice choice, but more screen time had to be given to this awesome actor and that'd make it better by far. Sadly, that was not happen. 50 Cent is generic but not so bad as some claimed, he does his job well. All in all, good film for one watch.",Escape Plan
83,quincytheodore,"Despite good star names, its poor material prevents it from escaping mediocrity.",5,23 October 2013,"Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger alone could advertise this movie, and it's admittedly good to have them both on-screen, but Escape Plan tries to ravel in more cerebral plot which doesn't really work well nor does it have much depth in narrative. Script is sloppy, pacing is a bit clumsy and they soon revert back to the way of machine gun, which arguably might be the inherited charm they bring with them. This is a shame because these two of such fame deserve better material than the movie could provide.To its credit, it starts off pretty well as Ray Breslin (Stallone) is introduced as prison break specialist. He would voluntarily enter a prison to test its design and escape by taking advantage of its flaws. With his illustrious career, he is hired to test a highly secretive shadily illegal prison. Everything isn't what it seems in this semi futuristic prison where he meets Emil Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger) a fellow inmate who claims to know secret location of most wanted man. Cue in some conspiracy later; it transpires into menial action thriller.The events switch into slower pace later on, an ironic turn while the movie tries to churn clever ways to escape. It doesn't appeal much and frankly is inferior to many other similar movies with such premise. The tricks are dull, almost borderline implausible. The movie undoubtedly relies heavily on audience's willingness to accept the nifty gimmicks and reception towards the duo combo. Plot twists are expectable, with barely any fresh idea in the mix. The pace is also rather uneven, it stutters when it should gain momentum and eventually just fades gradually more anticlimactic as it goes.Script is downright terrible, as if the two action stars are still using dialogues from two decades ago. This may be due to familiarity to said style, but they would merit from smarter writing. Hammy one-liners are uttered every few minutes to weakly sell the bravado. Screenplay feels sporadic; sometimes it seems to cut too fast or just doesn't explain much. At the very least, it does provide some chuckles, although they may be somewhat intentional yet serendipitously are the more memorable moments of the movie. Stallone and Schwarzenegger still possess big screen charisma to attract audience; they do need more witty scenes and less exaggerated machismo though.Escape Plan benefits from the stars duo and barely legitimate prison break premise, but its lack of thrill and slapstick script don't make for a compelling watch.",Escape Plan
84,MR_Heraclius,Predictable and not surprising.,6,20 February 2020,"The chemistry between Stallone and Schwarzenegger is fun and sharp, but the film's director is inappropriate and delivers a movie that could be much more than a recycled example of 80's kind of genre.",Escape Plan

86,blumdeluxe,How to get out,6,14 August 2017,"""Escape Plan"" is the story of an expert hired to find a way out of high security prisons to test their security level. When he gets a special offer from the government he feels challenged at first but soon has to learn that something is terribly wrong this time.The movie delivers a solid escape plot mixed with some typical action sequences and a very.. interesting choice of cast. Surely its popularity originates mainly from actors like Schwarzenegger or Stallone but in my opinion, the actual strong part of the film is really the element of tactics and mystery. In fact with a little less focus on action and a few more plot twists, the movie would have been even better. Nevertheless I have to say that the production was very carefully and even though you find some well-known weaknesses this one was way better than I had feared before.All in all I was pleased. What you see is pretty much what you get but it is a solid film and surely an evening of entertainment. Don't judge too hard on this one.",Escape Plan
87,gianmarcoronconi,Obvius plot,6,25 July 2021,Film with a fairly obvious plot that deals with a humor that as a profession escapes from prisons and then gets framed. The film is a good action with enough twists that enrich a plot if not very poor.,Escape Plan
88,Prashast_Singh,A solid throwback to the 80's and 90's action cinema.,10,10 February 2020,"I am a huge fan of action-thriller films like this one. Escape Plan is a nice throwback to the 80's and 90's action films featuring two defining stars of this genre: Stallone and Schwarzenegger. Trust me, when you see them doing action, especially Arnie, it gives the feeling that old school action filmmaking is still alive. And it should always be.Escape Plan has a very gripping and intense premise. It's replete with so much tension that there's hardly a moment to blink. It's intelligently plotted, of course action-packed, and makes good use of its confined prison setting. One hero is more brainy and the other is more brawny. That's what you expect from a film like this and thankfully it delivers. A special shout-out to the fight scene involving the two actors: possibly a dream come true for an action fan like me who used to imagine what would a fight between the two look like.The action and suspense are the highlights, but the writing here is also worth applause. It binds the set-pieces well and its fast pacing is another plus point. Escape Plan is for anyone who's into action thriller films and wants to see two of the greatest action stars on the screen together. I want their reunion once again.",Escape Plan
89,brchthethird,Serviceable escapist entertainment with Stallone and Scharzenegger in decent late-period form,6,14 November 2014,"While not every element of this high-tech prison movie clicks, Stallone and Schwarzenegger make for a good cinematic team and save the movie from falling into treacherous b-movie territory. The story is pretty simple: Stallone plays a guy who breaks out of prison for a living to test their security. However, on his latest job, he's set up and left to rot. He ends up joining forces with Schwarzenegger, and the two of them attempt to break out. These stars are the primary reason to see this film because most of the supporting cast just isn't given too much to do, nor are a lot of the bit parts particularly well acted or have compelling characters. Stallone and Schwarzenegger's characters aren't terribly well written either, but just enough detail is given and both of them bring some charisma to their roles. The also play off of one another quite well. The surprise gift in the cast, however, is Jim Caviezel as a sadistic warden. He plays his part with a certain calm and poise, which could be unsettling at times considering some of the violence he perpetrates on the inmates under his charge. In fact, a lot of the violence wasn't particularly fun to watch (not that violence should necessarily be fun to watch, though). Some of the negatives I can point out are a rather weak script that has a lot of implausibilities and narrative contrivances. There were a few twists, but nothing that a discerning moviegoer couldn't tell ahead of time. Out of the cast, Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson stood out as probably the worst of them all. He can't act, and I don't know why he keeps getting roles, especially here as a tech wizard. There was also some bad CGI explosions which looked out of place. Overall, this is an OK piece of ""escape""-ist entertainment (see what I did there?). Turn your brain off and you should have a good time.",Escape Plan
90,Andy-296,A bit silly but entertaining,8,24 January 2015,"An entertaining action movie, belonging to the ""escape from prison"" sub genre, starring Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Stalone is Ray Breslin, a sort of consultant that is usually thrown (undercover) in prison to test their security in order to turn them increasingly escape-proof. One day he is asked by an apparent CIA agent to do this sort of job for a clandestine Guantanamo-type prison. Off he goes, but he soon learns this was an entrapment and the prison authorities have no intention of letting him go. In jail he becomes friends with fellow prisoner Rottmayer (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a German who has information on a shady financier but is unwilling to disclose it to the very interested prison authorities. Soon Breslin and Rottmayer team together to investigate what is going on, and they find (SPOILER ALERT) that they are one a huge tanker type ship in high seas, so that escape seems almost impossible. On the other hand, we know nothing is impossible in movies for Stallone and the ""Gobernator"".Silly but fun, and well made (by Swedish director Mikael Halfstrom) for what it is. Stallone and Schwarzenegger remain credible action movie stars, despite both being in their mid sixties when they filmed this. Jim Caviezel plays the evil prison warden. Also with Sam Neill (!), a strange casting choice for an action film like this, playing the conscience troubled prison doctor.",Escape Plan
91,phubbs,Escape Plan,4,25 January 2014,"The film formerly known as 'The Tomb' and 'Exit Plan' gives us Arnie and Sly together again (becoming a habit), shame they never did this in their prime huh. One things for sure, the time away from the movie world hasn't been kind to Arnie acting wise. Not that he was much of an actor before but my Lord is he bad in this!.So Sly breaks out of top prisons for a living to see how good their security is, he is also paid shitzillions for doing so apparently. He then manages to get himself locked up in some ultra uber prison and naturally finds it a tad harder than expected. So in the end he must utilise the skills of another inmate called Arnold Schwarzenegger, basically its an extreme bondage and restraint fetish film hehe.The basic premise of this is pretty much the Chris Lambert flick 'Fortress', you can expect all the regular prison clichés and stereotypes from big bald violent inmates and sadistic wardens...hell what else would you expect?. Thing is the film feels like some kind of trashy low budget affair you'd expect to see JCVD, Seagal or Snipes in, the whole thing even looks pretty bland and uninteresting. Well it doesn't look like a prison put it that way, more like a level in The Crystal Maze...darlings.Apart from the cheesy techno visuals the film is also pretty ropey with its plot in various places. The entire prison is actually set within a massive cargo ship that floats off the coast of Africa/Morocco. Now surely at some point you might detect you're on a boat, there would be movement, motion, certain sounds, the shape of your surroundings, people tend to know when they're on a vessel generally. Sly's character also seems to be very very clever in this film which I can buy sure, making a homemade sextant? hmmm maybe I guess, they way he works out so easily the ship is off the coast of Morocco? errr getting a bit far fetched and the way Arnie keeps playing the warden time after time in the most obvious way. Anyone can tell he's up to something come on! and the moment he grabs that flat round piece of metal? oh come on now, there were about six guards on him at the time people!!.Vinnie Jones lets what's left of the film down by playing the exact same character he's almost always played (the vicious bad guy in case you didn't know). Sam Neill is the doctor who for some reason suddenly decides or realises he's working for bad guys the minute Sly talks to him. Never mind the fact he's been working there for some time, only now it dawns on him, oh then he vanishes for the last part of the film without a trace. Vincent D'Onofrio is clearly a bad guy tricking everyone right from the start, geez come on! and warden Caviezel is as predictable a villain as they come. Gets all his men to monitor C block because they see Sly sending a Morse code message yet failing to think it could be a setup and leaving all the other blocks virtually unguarded!? way to go boss.The film is trying to be some super bad ass prison adventure but it lacks both the gritty violence for serious Arnie/Sly fanboys and the fun adventure for everyone else. It lingers in action violence limbo. The plot plods along slowly in between rather pitiful looking fights and boring punishment sequences, all the while in this stale grey and black coloured environment. The inclusion of Muslim inmates against some Nazi inmates is the only thing to suggest this film has been made recently and not twenty years ago when it probably would have been black and Latino inmates.To finish off this cookie cutter Hollywood production you are given Arnie in 'Commando' mode with a big gun and lots and lots of faceless (literately) henchmen prison guards getting shots to bits all over the show. How many of these guys were on this ship??!. I guess you could say it doesn't really feel very special for either of the main stars, anyone could have been in these roles, absolutely any action star and it wouldn't make any difference. The fact they cast Arnie and Sly is probably to try and boost the entire averageness of the film. It just ain't hard enough to worry the classic 80's vehicles, a pale weak effort that is too dated with its ideas and an increasingly old looking Arnie (way more so than Sly).4/10",Escape Plan
92,adamscastlevania2,Decent 1990's sci-fi overspill,6,24 March 2015,"(58%) A hark back of sorts to the days of 1993's ""Fortress"" with a bit of Sly Stallone's own 1989's ""Lock up"", only with a slightly lighter feel. Arnold Schwarzenegger is much more of a co-star here to Sly meaning he doesn't show up until about 30 minutes in, but as a matter of opinion he's the best aspect of the entire show as he's clearly having a great time and it's also clear that he has not lost any of his brilliant enthusiasm. Even though is isn't too far off being a direct to video flick with it's slightly cheap feel and average plot, any fan of the two big guys should still check this out as it's worth a look for its sheer entertainment value alone.",Escape Plan
93,ivo-cobra8,My favorite underrated best Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger action prison thriller flick movie!,10,5 November 2015,"Escape plan (2013) is one of the best Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger action prison thriller flick movie. My two favorite childhood heroes from the 80's and 90's. I love you Sly and Arnie. Long Live the old action heroes 2 legends never die. Let me start by saying that the fact alone Schwarzenegger and Stallone are in their 60's doing a film like this is the ultimate reason to watch this. I can never understand why people claim they are too old. If anything they put people half their age to shame with their physical abilities and they should inspire people to want to stay energetic well into their senior years. This movie is absolute Gold! We finally have the two biggest movie stars of all time headlining a movie together and believe me you get what you pay for! The action and visuals were what I expected, very clear and stunning. The prison was almost a character itself in making the audience feel apart of the setting. My hat goes off to the director who was able to balance the off-screen chemistry between Stallone and Schwarzenegger and fuse it into the story. No joke these two guys were made to star in a movie together. The nostalgia is off the roof!! Every movie has its flaws and no doubt this one did but in saying that, I was able to automatically ignore them here because of the story, it was well paced. We see Stallone's character introduced as a prison security expert who is set up and put into the worlds most secure prison. Here he teams up with none other than Schwarzenegger who plays another prisoner, pretty much ""the one you don't mess with"". Together they plot their escape and it is done superbly! Overall I think this movie is a well made action thriller and will surprise audiences with something they haven't seen before from both Arnold and Sly. I will be surprised if this film doesn't get much attention at the box office because this movie goes back to a time when Hollywood was larger than life and gave us memorable characters and memorable action scenes.Sylvester Stallone still delivers his lines as garbled as ever, but he looks good for his age, and has not lost his charisma as an action star. He managed to be quite credible in playing such an incredibly-skilled individual. We are ready to suspend disbelief and accept that he can do the impossible. Hey, that is Stallone on that screen! Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a German inmate named Rottmeyer, who befriends Breslin. Arnie plays it light here, with his acting so typically awkward and actually funny, but we know and love him in this tongue-in-cheek style of his. ""Escape Plan"" isn't the greatest film ever made. But it is a fun, non-stop thrill ride B-movie that delivers the dream team we've always wanted...Arnie and Sly! History will prove that there will never be another Sylvester Stallone or another Arnold Schwarzenegger. These two legends have truly raisin the bar way high certainly when it comes to the action genre. Times may have changed and movie goers interest may have also changed but that does not change the fact that an actor like Sylvester Stallone has brought so much to the world of entertainment. Not only is he an actor, but he's a writer, producer and director. Seeing him and Arnold together was a blast. Escape Plan had an interesting story and was very entertaining, suspenseful, funny and a movie with great twists. I am giving this film a 10/10 because the film deserves it, I love it to death, the only thing that I didn't like was I was by time to time a little bored with it, but still was a great action fun! Great film, story, action. Both in one film was very entertaining in the movies! The basic plot of the film is: One of the world's foremost authorities on structural security agrees to take on one last job: breaking out of an ultra-secret, high-tech facility called ""The Tomb.""Escape Plan is a 2013 American action thriller film starring Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger, and co-starring Jim Caviezel, Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson, Vinnie Jones, Vincent D'Onofrio and Amy Ryan Escape Plan is directed by Swedish filmmaker Mikael Håfström.10/10 Grade: A Studio: Summit Entertainment, Lionsgate Starring: Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jim Caviezel, Sam Neill, Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson Director: Mikael Håfström Producers: Robbie Brenner, Mark Canton, Randall Emmett, George Furla, Kevin King Templeton Screenplay: Miles Chapman, Jason Keller Story: Miles Chapman Rated: R Running Time: 1 Hr. 55 Mins.

94,juliankennedy23,Fun movie with a good supporting cast and some decent action beats.,6,31 December 2018,"Escape Plan: 6 out of 10: In Escape Plan Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone are two retirees at the Shady Oaks nursing home. When they find out their favorite band Starship is playing at the local Ribfest they plot their escape but can they get past the new nurse Tyrone played by 50 Cent.Seriously shouldn't these guys be making comedies with Morgan Freeman and Tommy Lee Jones by now? Anyway, the actual plot is a bit sillier than what I wrote above. Sylvester Stallone is a professional prisoner hired by the department of corrections to test their jails security. A CIA operative hires him to test a Black Site prison where the worst of the worst are kept. Shenanigans ensue.The Good: Honestly I can watch Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone in almost anything as long as neither of them tries to emote and both of them try to shoot things. This film meets both these criteria. Special shout out to Arnold who seems to be having a really good time no matter what is going on.As stupid as the story is the film does try to make it work with some twists here and there. They won't fool many people past the age of thirteen and Sly's backstory on how he became a professional prisoner is so paint by the numbers it comes with a felt pen, but I appreciate the effort for what is, in essence, a ninety-minute jailbreak movie.For someone who has expressed in more than one review how he dislikes men in prison movies. (Women in prison movies are a whole different genre, trust me) I seem to watch a lot of them. So on the very plus side in Escape Plan there is a lack of some obvious prison tropes. Among the common tropes that are thankfully absent, there isn't a sensitive prisoner with a pet bird or artwork that is begging to be destroyed, there is no boxing program, and nobody drops any soap throughout the proceedings.The Bad: There is a real-world company called Parkour Generations that is hired to escape from prisons. It isn't exactly the same set-up as this film, however. For example, the prisons are not usually filled with actual prisoners at the time and in addition, none of the employees would be mistaken for Sly Stallone. But the undercover guy in prison is a trope for a reason I guess. Other tropes that make an appearance are that one screw who hits extra hard and the drunk prison doctor (a slumming Sam Neill.)The Ugly: The sequel Escape Plan 2: Hades really makes you realize how much Arnold Schwarzenegger ads to the enjoyment of this film. Well, Arnold and a decent budget and good direction. Good Lord the sequel was bad.
In Conclusion: This is a live-action cartoon with Arnold and Sly playing well Arnold and Sly. As these things go it is a relatively breezy fun time. It's not good per se but as the sequel proved it could have been a lot worse. Fun movie with a good supporting cast and some decent action beats.",Escape Plan
95,dave-mcclain,"""Escape Plan"" is a great pairing of legendary action stars, but falls a little short in its story-telling.",7,27 November 2015,"Here's a movie with a great title, a great movie poster, a great trailer and a great pairing of legendary action stars. The two ""Escape Plan"" (R, 1:56) co-stars have made (as of 2013) a combined total of over 100 films. This movie is perfectly named because it tells you what the story is about without revealing whether the setup results in a successful conclusion for its protagonists. You may think that you know how this movie will end, but nothing is guaranteed in this intricate and twisty action thriller.Sylvester Stallone stars as Ray Breslin, a man who makes his living breaking out of maximum security prisons to show prison officials the flaws in their designs, procedures, personnel or some combination thereof. Breslin is the best at what he does. He wrote the book on prison security – literally. As the film opens, Breslin is executing his latest escape plan by making a series of very curious preparations. When he's out and his boss (Vincent D'Onofrio, playing nicely against type) tells the prison's warden why Breslin was really there and allows Breslin to explain how he escaped, the payoff is clever and impressive. All this leads to his most challenging (and lucrative) assignment yet – testing the security of a new type of prison, one designed for individuals who various governments around the world want disappeared. Breslin's ego and greed lead him to take the job, but he soon finds out that he's got more than he bargained for and he may not be there for the reasons that he was told when he was hired.The warden is played by Jim Caviezel who makes a deliciously dry villain. (It's also a fun bit of casting, considering that his first starring role was in 2002's underrated ""The Count of Monte Cristo"", in which he plays a man unjustly sent to a remote prison by people who want HIM disappeared.) Breslin is soon befriended by Arnold Schwarzenegger's character, Emil Rottmayer, an inmate who has some information that the warden seems determined to get out of him (ironically, similar to the situation we see with a prisoner who befriends Jim Caviezel's innocent man in ""Monte Cristo"".) It's not long before Rottmayer is using his considerable strength and knowledge of the prison to help Breslin engineer his escape, in exchange for Breslin's promise to take him along. Meanwhile, Amy Ryan, Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson, Sam Neill and Vinnie Jones lend their considerable talents in important supporting roles.This is a thinking person's action thriller for the most part. The prison that Breslin finds himself stuck in is uniquely designed and looks to be impossible to escape, and the reveal of its location is pretty wild. Breslin is brilliant and resourceful (call him the MacGyver of prison breaks), while Rottmayer is an indispensable ally with an intriguing level of mystery to him. Breslin's plans and tricks are highly original and fun to watch play out. This is the best film and some of the best acting that I've seen out of both Stallone and Schwarzenegger is many years. Unfortunately, towards the end, the movie falls back on well-worn action film tropes that are very familiar to long-time fans of Stallone and Schwarzenegger, and the story's resolution feels a bit cheesy and similarly reminiscent of the two stars' heyday. In addition, some of the questions the film raises about the main character's backgrounds aren't as clearly answered as they should have been. As great as most of this film was, as a whole, ""Escape Plan"" is only able to make off with a ""B+"" from me.",Escape Plan
96,Vivekmaru45,Caution: Jintropin Mutant(or Freak) In Cell Block D.,4,2 February 2014,"If you know your man Sly Stallone well, you will immediately understand what I have written above. If not, just google: Stallone caught with Jintropin(or HGH).So what is Jintropin/HGH? It is a banned substance that performance athletes use to boost their physical/sexual(?) performance. Stallone had already tried Botox and Viagra. But these combinations did nothing to keep his limp yang up. So he resorted to stronger stuff: a.k.a. HGH.Wait! Jintropin/HGH has a secret use also... It is also an anti-aging wonder drug. HGH levels are high in newborns(naturally as they tend to grow) but as a the body becomes older, say in the thirties or forties, these levels tend to drop. HGH is crucial in repairing cell damage. Thus if Stallone uses HGH on a daily bases he plans to live forever...But Stallone is not GOD. Only GOD lives forever. And there is only ONE of him. And he dislikes competition.I only wanted to see this film because I really liked Mikael Håfström's earlier horror film 1408. I thought this one would be as suspenseful as that one. But the guy really let me down. The film is an average and mediocre escape flick. I have seen better films over the years and even Fortress 1992 is a better film than this one. My favorite Mr. Olympia(Arnold) is also in the film, but even he could not lift this film from mediocrity.Jim Caviezel is the real star of the film. He plays the baddie to perfection. And you know that if Stallone stars in a film: the chicks in the film are steaming hot. But Stallone gives us no sex scenes in the film because he had some Yang problems since his stash of HGH was seized by the U.S. Government. Why? Well Obama also has some Yang problems and since he requested Stallone for some and he refused, what could he do but send a S.W.A.T. team + Navy Seal Team + (Bill Goldberg + The Undertaker + Brock Lesnar as backups - if the above 2 failed.) Talk about Stud. Arnold has zero Yang problems, but during the filming was casting an eager eye at Stallone's still tight butt. The future looks rosy for Stallone/Arnold collaboration(if Sly sees it that way...).Better prison-escape films in chronological order: Stalag 17 (1953), The Great Escape 1964, Papillon 1973, Escape from Alcatraz 1979, Escape from Sobibor 1987, Fortress 1992, The Shawshank Redemption 1994, Cube 1997, Cube 2 2003, Cube Zero 2004.Cheers :)P.S. Message from Slyvester Stallone: If any of youz needz HGH, I am the sole(not the fish) distributor(not the car part) of this miracle drug. I can recommend this drug highly for all of youz who has yang problems. HGH has helped me get into bed, do the job and keep my b*tch from running away to Brad Pitt. I sold some to Arnold and he will also vouch for me. He's a nice guy - unlike Obama who sent guys to my house and took it by force without paying me :(P.S.S. From Sly Ex-Stallion: This drug will do nothing to improve your brain power. I am still as dumb as I was during Rocky 1. Even my dog is smarter than me(?!)",Escape Plan
97,Maziun,"Not bad , not bad at all",4,21 June 2014,"You might like them or not , but the fact is that Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger are two REAL ICONS of cinema . For years fans were hoping for a movie with both of them in it. In some way it happened in ""Expendables"" and ""Expendables 2"", but those movies were more like team effort of old school action heroes. Here we finally have a movie with just two of them.I was worried about this movie. I was afraid that it will be very boring and serious movie . I also didn't wanted this movie to over the top and cheesy entertainment , because that was already done with ""Expendables"". The idea for this story didn't seem too exciting . The whole ""innocent in prison"" story was already made in movies like ""Lock up"" , ""The fortress"" or ""The Running man "" (in a way). I was also aware that Stallone's and Schwarzenegger's glory days are pretty much over.""The Escape plan"" however turned out to be quite decent entertainment. It's not a great movie , but it didn't deserved to be a box office failure. The filmmakers obviously put some effort in it and it's not some cheap movie trying to make money only on Stallone's and Schwarzenegger's reputation (well , at least not in 100%).The story is simple and rather predictable , but it's got some twists in it. I LOVED the twist about the prison and I liked the explanations for the escapes. The prison itself looks nice – futuristic , with guards in masks reminding me of ""THX 1138"". The social commentary is very simple (Private prisons are bad) , but that's not the reason why we want to watch this kind of movie , don't we ?Both Stallone and Schwarzenegger are convincing in their roles. The movie portrays them not only as strong men , but also smart ones. The supporting cast is solid with Jim Caviezel (""Passion of the Christ"") , Vinnie Jones (""Snatch"") , Vincent D'Onorfio (""Full metal jacket"") and Sam Neill (""Jurassic park""). One also has to remember that this movie is for most part a thriller with some action in it. The action scenes itself aren't bad .What I didn't liked ? There is a fight between Stallone and Schwarzenegger here that is unfortunately just lame. Very short and forgettable. Come on ! It's Schwarzenegger and Stallone ! They should make great fighting scene with them after all those years of waiting. I also don't understand what is 50 Cent doing here playing a computer genius. Seriously , people Also , Sam Neill kinda disappears at the end of the movie without any explanation.Both Stallone and Schwarzenegger deserved a better movie ( I regret the wasted chance for ""Face off""). It's not the best one for either of them , yet they don't have any reason to feel embarrassed about this one. I'm glad that they were able to make a movie together and bring some joy to my life. Worth renting for a night . Decent B-class one timer. I give it 5/10.",Escape Plan
98,silvermistvio,What a great film!,9,23 June 2019,"I've never watched Stallone films before I watched this one. I've watched a lot of films but I haven't come across. I saw this film on local TV channel and I totally love it.It's somehow different from those films, especially because it's about escaping the prison. So, it gives a different case. What I love about this film is how Ray explains the location of the prison. Ray is such a clever guy. And also the way he studies the prison and escapes from the prison is the best scenes of all.Overall is that Escape Plan is quite interesting and enjoyable film because of the amazing performance of Stallone. I totally love this film.",Escape Plan
99,bryank-04844,I counted six one liners in the Schwarzenegger/Stallone film 'Escape Plan'.,5,22 August 2015,"I counted six one liners in the Schwarzenegger/Stallone film 'Escape Plan'. I was hoping for more, and when it came to Schwarzenegger's big moment to deliver the goods, they must've hired a three year old, because his one-liner was pretty lame, as is much of this action thriller that finally has the two biggest action stars of the 80s together at last for an entire movie. Now before we get into the good and bad of this film, let us first discuss the director, whose name is Mikael Hafstrom, who directed the John Cusack vehicle '1408'. But more interestingly, Hafstrom wrote a movie called 'Kopps', which you can see a brief snippet below (it's required viewing to proceed with the review)....I mean, it's one of the best scenes in movie history, and this is what we are more or less dealing with in 'Escape Plan', but less awesome. In what seems like reliving the glory days of the 80s action movies these iconic actors starred in, we follow Ray Breslin (Stallone), whose job is to be secretly arrested and put in the highest security prisons in America under a fake name, and attempt to escape, exposing the facilities weak points, so that the government can fix it. And he's damn good at it too, his record is 14-0.He wrote a book on his work and is one of the partners in a company that makes their money by doing this. His team that tracks his every move and makes sure he is safe doesn't seem plausible or real, which include Amy Ryan, Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson, and Vincent D'Onofrio. These characters are lifeless and and could have been played by anyone. But when a strange young woman offers Ray and his company double their normal salary if he chooses to be incarcerated in a new beta prison system that is privately funded and completely off the grid. Well, he gets more than he bargained for, as he wakes is drugged, beaten and wakes up in this new prison.This prison is large and is full of multiple stories of glass boxes with masked guards always watching. This new prison is for the worst of the worst, where these awful criminals don't stand trial and go simply to disappear. He soon enough meets Emil Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger), who takes an interest in Ray, as he notices him observing all of the guards routines and kinks - if any in the system. After a fight between the two action stars to which Schwarzenegger tells Stallone that he hits like a vegetarian, the two become pals and work together to escape, as it becomes clear that the Warden (Jim Caviezel), a sadistic man is working with someone close to Ray to keep in prison forever. With the warden's right hand man (Vinnie Jones), who seemed to only sign up for guard duty to break some skulls, and a physician (Sam Neill), who is willing by fearful for his life to say or help anyone, it seems that Stallone and Schwarzenegger have their work cut out for them.The movie drags on and on until we get to the final battle scene where get a famous Schwarzenegger slow motion sequence where he finds his friend - a big machine gun, and literally kills over one hundred guards in a matter of minutes. There are a few twists and turns here and all of them you can see coming from a mile away.Sure, this is a fun and entertaining film to a certain degree. I mean, it has our two favorite action stars from the 80s in it finally kicking butt together. The characters are one note, the dialogue is awfully bad, and the pacing is at times rough, but that being said, it's great to see these two older actors still kicking and taking names. For the other actors in the film besides Caviezel, surely only showed up for this to be in a film with these two action stars and nothing more.I suggest a cocktail or three before watching this movie.",Escape Plan
100,witster18,"better than expected. flawed, but welcome throwback. very mild spoilers.",6,7 February 2014,"Let's face it - there's a number of reasons to have NOT expected much from this one. I'll spare you the list.The film is far from perfect. I think it jumps into the main storyline a bit fast, 50 Cent can't act(awful), and a bit more violence(perhaps a little more blood) might have gone a long way(I mean it's rated R anyway - so how about a bit more - after all there's no sex/nudity, and not much bad language either - I wonder why they didn't just scale back 1 scene or something to get a pg-13 - it seems as if they did already). The ending is as rushed as the set-up, and overall, the script is a bit rigid. Seems like everyone is in a five word contest for two hours.Now for the good. And there's quite a bit of it. Sly and Arnold are great. Both individually and together their characters just work. This is an upgrade in quality for both the actor's recent work.Isn't it great to see an action movie that doesn't have to rely on a bunch of CGI? This is definitely a throwback in more ways than one, and what better way to get it with two aging stars in a re-watchable action yarn.The idea of the character of Breslin is great. We've seen similar stuff in ""Sneakers"" and other films, but the idea is handled quite well here. Interesting storyline.Vinnie Jones(henchman/head-guard) and Jim Caviezel(warden) are great as the villains - especially Caviezel who gets the nod for best performance in the film. I also loved the look of the guards. I loved the idea of the prison. Amy Ryan, Vincent D'Onofrio, Sam Neil, and Faran Tahir were also good in smaller roles, and may have really been the saving grace of the film. Something of Sly's(Breslin's) life outside of his profession would have helped. still.Definitely in the top half of the 70 or so films I've seen from 2013. Probably around #30-32, and considering what I was expecting, that's not bad. That makes two 'commemorative surprises' this week(see ""Last Vegas"" too). Both cheap rentals that are worth your time.You'll like this if you liked: Sneakers(better), Tango and Cash(equal or ever-so-slightly better), Lock-Up(not as good), and Eraser(ever-so-slightly below). 62/100 Thanks for reading.

While the concept is utter nonsense, it could've been passable if they stuck with the escape plan (no pun) instead of degrading to shootouts and blowups.

Well in a lot of ways Sylvester Stallone, and Arnold Schwarzenegger have done that in many many ways. Yes they have both had great careers that gave them millions of dollars, and made their ex- wives super rich, and what more is there to the American dream right? Well we all know that for more than 30 years now the two have made jabs at one another in their own movies, and been compared in a thousand ways, even though we all know they are total opposites. But in all of those years until this picture (and the Expendables does not count cause those are really just Arnold cameos) the two men have never done what has been needed for so long, and made a movie together. Well so they did, is it any good? I have to say that I Enjoyed it quite a bit. The whole thing plays like it was storyboarded really well, and there was a lot of good money put into the budget for prep, and post. Everything about this movie is formulaic caper stuff, but it is fun. I liked the main story, I thought that a chimpanzee could have picked up on the clues you were being given from the start, but I guess that is good foreshadowing, and at least they followed through. So I would say yes, this is a good movie, and I would recommend it to anyone, with just a small violence, and blood warning with some language, but the main story is tight, and the acting is well rehearsed.

106,griffolyon12,A Spoiler-Free Review,8,15 November 2013,"If you have been missing the nonsensical action flicks of the late Eighties and Nineties, then Escape Plan is for you. In the film, we have Stallone and Arnold, two of the big heavyweights of the action genre, working together to try and escape a high security prison, run by the always awesome, Jim Caviezel. That's all you need to know in order to decide whether or not to see this film. It's fun, full of suspense, and has some good doses of action, but it's not wall-to-wall explosions either, and that's where I found most of my enjoyment coming from with this film. While Stallone and Arnold are pretty much playing who they always play, the story is relatively smart and has a good number of twist and turns that keep you on your toes. As a matter of fact, I'd classify this film more as a high concept suspense/thriller, rather than an action film, even though there are a bunch of gunfights, punches, and explosions near the end. While Escape Plan may not be as memorable as Rambo or True Lies, due to it's been there-done that vibe it just can't shake by throwing back to so many of those kinds of movies, it's a fun movie that is well worth seeing if you love the cast and the genre.I give Escape Plan an 8 out of 10!",Escape Plan

I was not sure what to expect but with both Stallone and Schwarzenegger in it I think I expected a high powered action flick full of unnecessary violence. What I got was an intelligent, well thought out film with some clever ideas. In fact this is what the Mission impossible series of films should have been like instead of what they were, a vehicle for Tom Cruise action flicks. All the acting is good, and I mean all. Every actor stepped up the plate here and produced some great cinema.

108,SquigglyCrunch,Fun and Interesting to Watch,7,25 February 2016,"Escape Plan is a movie starring Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Under normal circumstances you'd expect some over- the-top awesome action movie, but this movie is anything but. The plot of Escape Plan is, while it feels like something we've seen before, really isn't. At least I haven't. It follows a man who breaks out of prisons for a living to test how secure they are, and is eventually faced with a prison so secure that it's nearly impossible to break out of. While it's presented in a way that I think we've all seen before, the general idea of someone being paid to break out of prison over just breaking out of prison is different, and I think that that alone allows it to stand out from other prison movies. The character development is all fine and dandy, but when it comes down to it it really isn't anything special. You care enough about the characters, but it's not the primary focus, nor is it unintentionally amazing either. Overall Escape Plan is an interesting movie that feels like one we've all seen before, only with a twist. The plot is good and generally well-presented, and the movie itself turns out to be a lot of fun to watch. In the end I'd recommend this movie to pretty much anyone. It's enough fun to watch that most people will enjoy it, while interesting enough that people will still be able to enjoy it from a more critical standpoint.",Escape Plan

110,RevRonster,Not great...but not horrible either.,6,2 February 2014,"Despite the fact I haven't been impressed with much of their work lately, you can't deny the fact that Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger are the grandfathers of the action genre. So what's it like when you put the two of them together in a film (which should have happened a long time ago) and it's not one of those ""Expendables"" movies that play out like a bad fake, fan-made trailer on YouTube? Actually, you get a fairly decent film.I wont' play coy here; ""Escape Plan"" isn't completely spectacular. The film has its problems. For example, Vinnie Jones is in the film and he's just lethargically playing the same character he's been riding on since his Guy Ritchie days (only, he's lost the unique wit and humor he had in those days) but at least he's not playing the Juggernaut in this film because that was just embarrassing for all of us. Secondly, the movie shifts tones during the climax and it was slightly jarring. The film goes from a movie about guys sneaking out of an inescapable prison to guys just deciding to shoot their way out. It goes from interesting to ""eh, let's become a generic action film"" very quickly. Finally, the movie has some unresolved plot threads towards its end and it make a mad dash like a demon is on its tail to try and get them resolved before the credits decide to shut the whole thing down. However, despite the problems, the movie has its elements working for it and makes it a watchable film and something destined to be played numerous times on FX or Spike. Stallone and Schwarzenegger are terrific together and are giving performances that are probably the best they've done in the last decade. Plus, it's very clear Arnold is having a blast with his role and it was sorta infectious. Finally, Jim Caviezel is a decent antagonist as the film's evil warden to the high tech prisonthat is, when you can hear him. Caviezel really enjoyed whispering all his lines.""Escape Plan"" may not be the most memorable film of either Stallone's or Schwarzenegger's career but the movie is mildly entertaining and worked for what it is.Hi!

111,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Blocked Up,3,18 October 2013,"Sylvester Stallone is Ray Breslin When Ray goes to prison, which happens quite a lot, he doesn't sit around playing solitaire. Upon perpetual scrutiny, everything about the interior turns mathematical His job is to find the weak points and escape There's an old Tim Conway flick where he and his buddy are imprisoned, part of a secret mission for the governor... When the governor dies, the boys become actual inmates...Same thing happens here, kind of. Breslin is given a classified, high-paying gig from the CIA to test a prison that doesn't register on the map... Where the inmates aren't even listed They've been ""disappeared"" from the earthHe winds up in a mysterious location called The Tomb (the film's original title) where an abundance of cubicle, glass-structured cells are leveled throughout a cold, mazy warehouse (imagine Hannibal Lecter in a giant version of a Star Trek multi-layered chess set) There's simply no way of escape and, worse yet, the warden knows nothing of Ray's agenda.The main device of ESCAPE PLAN is the pairing of Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Instead of an EXPENDABLES style cameo, Arnold plays second-fiddle, a graying-gruff inmate named Rottmayer, who, like James Garner in THE GREAT ESCAPE and Morgan Freeman in THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, is the go-to guy providing ""favors."" He also spouts a limited amount of exposition about this strange, impenetrable purgatory. Leading to several twists along the way the biggest one revealed much too soon.In the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE fashion there's an abundance of intricate dialogue – mostly Ray's narration, centering on the prison's routine and vulnerability. This also becomes a hindrance to the story. With so much explanation it never feels like the characters are actually stuck in a dire circumstance. Meanwhile, Arnold's lackluster performance and an embarrassingly overboard Jim Caviezel, who makes Donald Sutherland's hissing LOCK-UP warden seem tame, doesn't help matters.Take away the science-fiction aspect of a modernized, futuristic detention center and you're left with a below-average prison flick that a few gut-wrenching mess hall brawls can't save The overblown, over-explained PLAN exceeds the rushed, anticlimactic ESCAPE...",Escape Plan

I know they were in the Expendables movies together, but I didn't really count that as they shared the limelight with a lot more stars. This if the first movie they made together where the poster says both of their names at the top and for me it did not disappoint.The movie is about a guy who is paid to be sent to jail and try and break out. All goes well until he is sent to a jail that is at an unknown location, and his password and contacts are void. He is stuck in jail surrounded by the most notorious criminals and must break out, not just for his job but his life!The story is great. I like the idea of it a lot. The way he breaks out of the jails in the beginning are well done and thought out well, but I doubt very much he would be able to do what he does. There are plenty of pot holes in this movie, but if you are going to watch a film starring Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger, you know full well to expect full on cheese and action. There are some really cheesy moments and great one liners. As always, Arnie gets some great lines and says them the best way he knows how I am so glad he is back in the movies. He was missed.The action is great. There are some really good fight scenes featuring Sly. Even Arnie gets to throw a few punches, but I felt that he was more a secondary character. I was hoping Arnie would do more But he was in most of the movie and he did get some action scenes so I shouldn't complain really.The acting really was not really Oscar worthy, but again in a cheesy action film we should not expect it. Sly did a good job, but he looked in pain through the whole movie. The man cannot turn his head. He looked like he had a stiff neck all the way through the movie. He looks a mess he is still pumped up, but the veins in his arms looked like a London underground map. Haha. Arnie was great his acting was questionable, but when has his acting ability ever not been? The guy is a legend and always will be responsible for the best action movies ever made. The one thing that was missing was the phrase he did not say ""I'll be back"" in the movie at all. Shame.Other cast members were Jim Caviezel, Faran Tahir, Amy Ryan, Sam Neill, Vincent D'Onofrio, Vinnie Jones and Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson. The casting was pretty good apart from one character. Vinnie Jones really didn't belong in this film. He looked silly wearing the weird uniform, and his acting really did not fit in the movie. He stuck out like a sore thumb. Whoever cast him really should have got someone different.I really enjoyed this movie it was exactly what I expected to see. It is not the best Stallone or Schwarzenegger film, but it was fantastic to see them on screen together.

117,stevenrotherforth,Sly and Arnie in a film together? Yeah right!,7,18 November 2018,"Escape PlanAfter reviewing Escape Plan 2 and declaring it to be the worst film of Stallone's career I thought I should give my thoughts on the first movie.
Thankfully Escape Plan is a different kettle of fish to its dire sequel.
A surprisingly entertaining film due to the onscreen chemistry between Sly and Arnie.
Stallone plays security expert Ray Breslin who specialises in testing prisons by breaking out of them.
When he is incarcerated in a new high tech jail known as the Tomb he has to team up with Arnie's character in order to break out.What we get is a six pack drinking, T-bone steak of a movie. With macho lines like ""You hit like a vegetarian!""being despatched with glee from our pumped up heroes.
It's certainly big but by no means clever.
A throw back to the actioners of the 80's and 90's when both the stars of this film were at their peak.
Imagining having Sly and Arnie in a movie together back then would have needed a budget so big, that after paying their salaries the rest of the film would have had to be shot using a cheap Polaroid camera. FFWD to 2013 and both of these two Hollywood heavyweights aren't the box office draw that they once was.
A team up movie seems like a good idea especially after the success of the Expendables franchise.
Here the focus is solely on Stallone and Schwarzenegger.
Both put in strong performances. This is a movie that die hard action fans can get their teeth into.
Come to think of it fans of Die Hard should enjoy this too! Die Hard in a prison?
Now there's a novel idea.Every cheesy action movie is only as good as it's villain.
Rest assured Jim Caviezel delivers the goods as nasty prison warden Hobbes.
Backed up by pantomime style baddy played by Vinnie Jones Escape Plan services the needs of the fans.
There's strong support too from the always likeable Vincent D'Onofrio and Sam Neill.
There also an appearance by the wooden 50 cent but being wooden is hardly a problem in a movie such as this.
All in all Escape Plan is a great way to waste 1hr 55mins.

118,p-jonsson,Good movie on a rather classical plot theme,7,23 March 2014,"This is a movie that had more or less escaped under my radar until I saw it mentioned in one of my news feeds as a Blu-ray giveaway a couple of days ago. Given that it had both Stallone and Schwarzenegger in it, it was really a must buy for me.The escape from prison plot theme is not exactly a new idea but must be considered a rather classical one. A lot of great books and movies have, if not been centered around that theme so at least had it as a major plot element. I would say that it is rather difficult to make a new movie on this theme these days without it feeling a bit stale.During my movie evening yesterday I was happy to find that this one succeeds quite well in not feeling stale. It also succeeds very well in pairing together Stallone and Schwarzenegger without making it deteriorate into some action hero parody.The basic plot is in one sense the classical hero gets framed, thrown into jail and has to escape. In another sense it is slightly unconventional in that our hero is not only an escape artist, or rather an escape specialist, but a legal one at that.Both Stallone and Schwarzenegger are doing a good job of their roles. We all know that these two actors are not exactly Shakespeare-material and is not really competing for any acting Oscars but they do deliver solid performance as male, though-guy, heroes.The bad guy at the prison is not too bad, in terms of performance, either. The one person I felt was a bit meh was the guy who set Breslin up. I also think they could have made more of a show in nailing that bastard in the end. Not that he did not get what he deserved but I missed a ""I'm back"" moment with a confrontation between Breslin and him.On the whole a quite enjoyable movie even though the prison break theme is not one of my favorite ones. Oh, and as usual Rotten Tomatoes ""official"" rating is pure nonsense. Due to their idiotic rating mechanism they flag it as rotten which it most certainly is not.",Escape Plan
119,Finfrosk86,"Pretty good concept, but a little bland and.. bland.",6,13 June 2015,"I so, so, so wanted to love this movie. I am a huge Schwarzenegger-fan, I like Stallone, and I also like some of the director Mikael Håfströms earlier work. Ondskan (Evil) is fantastic. But sometimes a lot of cool stuff put together, doesn't make super cool. Sometimes it just doesn't quite work.I am a little bummed out to say that Escape Plan is one of those times. I don't know exactly what it is, but you get a slight TV-movie vibe from this. It is a little bland. There is something missing. You kind of get the feeling someone just ordered this. No real passion went into it. (maybe that's the case?)The story is alright, the acting is sufficient, the action is good enough, it's all alright, but never really much more. Yes it is good fun seeing Arnie and Stallone together, but like I said, it is a little bland. A shame, really. With a little bit more edge in the story it could have been a lot better. Yes, I think the screenplay is what is really at fault here. It is just too.. flat.",Escape Plan

121,tankace,Better than I though.,7,30 June 2016,"Escape plan is a movie than you can see in your living room with friends and have fun, while doing it and see both Stallone and Schwatcheneger act for ones like regular persons is a breath of fresh air after the Expentables franchise and the over the top characters that even a kid couldn't take them seriously. Although for more , you will love it after you get drunk.So the flick follows Stallone playing a expert in escaping from prisons, who's job is to find the weak point of prisons and then inform the crew there to make the need it changes. But after ,naturally, a contract goes rogue and he is stranded in to a ultra max prison he must ally with Schwatcheneger in order to get out. Don't wait much more than ,some nice plans and respectable action scenes, because you won't get it ,think it as a dinner with the extended family if it went good and you found company to pass nicely your time.I don't know were to put in the films of these actions legends who still try to be in faction in their seventies (tragic) ,but if you compare it with the majority of their works in the past decade and a half is in the best, so recommended I guess. At the very least is better than Terminator Genisys, Expentables and similar projects!In the end for the action pump lovers is fine for the rest ,enjoyable pass time.",Escape Plan
122,dvc5159,The men with a plan,8,18 October 2013,"Having his characters being put in prison in many of his films, Sylvester Stallone this time has his character, Ray Breslin, specialize in breaking out of jails to find their weak spots. Breslin even co-owns a security firm and wrote a book about it.Alas, as it is with this sort of movies, he gets more than he bargained for when he is inexplicably kidnapped and put in an ultra high-tech, maximum security prison nicknamed ""The Tomb"". Somewhat ingenious, as each glass-walled cell is elevated on platforms, with a descending probe-like camera watching every move these inmates make. Nor does the sadistic guards and the warden, the charismatic yet ruthless Hobbes (James Caviezel), give them a chance to move, for that matter. So while Breslin's partners try to find him, Breslin gets some unexpected help from fellow prisoner Emil Rottmayer (Arnold Schwarzenegger).This is fun. Mikael Håfström's ""Escape Plan"" - the latest from the promising Swedish filmmaker, details this high concept into a somewhat predictable, but handsomely crafted and undeniably very rousing entertainer. Unlike ""The Expendables"" which gave a wink too many to the audience at times, ""Escape Plan"" is the real deal - a true blue, old school '80s - '90s action classic - that somehow found its way to the present day and managed to make two of the biggest stars of that era age for that same amount. Same look, stars and feel - but a different time, era and thematic content. There's even a badass heroic Muslim character (Faran Tahir), and not-so-subtle political ('Blackwater') undertones.Although the two action icons headline the title, this is arguably Stallone's film. As Breslin, Stallone cuts back on the humor and plays his role straight with an undeniably commanding presence, but doesn't go too far as he did in the mediocre ""Bullet to the Head"" earlier this year. Well, a 67 year old with a jacked physique as a security expert may be pushing it a bit, but I've seen much worse. Besides, he has a moment which I did not expect in a film like this - character development, which was then skirted aside thanks to those wacky guards.Speaking of wacky, Arnold Schwarzenegger, sporting grey hair and a beard, is for the most part hilarious as Rottmayer. While being basically an ascended supporting character, Arnold, with a presence equally as commanding as Stallone's, plays his role with his tongue firmly in cheek, giving foil to Stallone's serious personality and coming up with some of the film's best lines - some of which are in his native German tongue. He should seriously consider a rebirth in comedy once he's done reliving what's left of his action glory - he can be truly hysterical if he wants to (note: ""True Lies"") - or Austrian/German roles for that matter. The chemistry and banter between Arnold and Sly is excellent as they play each other off very well as they would in real-life (their interviews together are a hoot) and it's fun to see these two friends having a blast on-screen.Where the ""Expendables"" somewhat missed the mark on their villains (JCVD should have had more screen time), ""Escape Plan"" hits it right on target. Although portraying a two-dimensional character, Jim Caviezel is terrific as Warden Hobbes, his piercing eyes, calm demeanor and soft- spoken charisma just gives off this extremely strong sense of antagonism and nastiness with whatever word that comes out of his mouth. It's reasonable that we don't have villains like this in the movies any more, but Caviezel shows us why we still need them. This is the villain that ""Die Hard 5"" should have gotten. I won't be surprised if Caviezel portrays a supervillain in a comic-book movie in the near future.These three take center stage in the elaborately designed facility, where the prison cells resemble transparent Rubik's cubes and a somewhat harsh method of solitary confinement that involves blinding light and strong heat in a claustrophobic metal room. Such is the production design by Barry Chusid (""2012"") who should be commended for the prison a life and character of it's own, with its spewing steam and claustrophobic rooms breathing a foreboding sense of dread behind the high tech. The cinematography seems to harken back to the days of yore where fight sequences weren't shot with hand-held cameras, though some of the visual effects are dodgy.The screenplay by Miles Chapman and Arnell Jesko (Jason Keller) is about as direct as it can get - but it paces itself appropriately without rushing or dragging the plot. Though I feel that the duo might have seen one too many an action film while writing the climax, but it's all good. Strangely enough, despite what I've heard from critics, the film has little-to-no one-liners (Arnie's 'vegetarian' quote seems to be the only one). The breakout scenes may be implausible, but I'm willing to suspend my disbelief, because hey, you can't keep Stallone's characters in jail.Accentuating the intense atmosphere, and what I think makes the film work, is Håfström's strong direction which again focuses more on plot and character rather than action sequences - a feat he has accomplished on his previous thrillers ""1408"", ""Derailed"" and ""Shanghai"" - all with equally perfect major casting. However, Håfström should also be commended for saving the only major action sequence for the final third of the film, creating not only mystery and tension for the first two halves but also a terrific build-up to an explosive, insane and crowd- pleasing climax which sees the two action icons doing what they do best - kick ass. Age be damned.This was a fun ride from start to finish but it's time for their action hero days to end and for their careers to move on to more interesting and grounded stuff. They can't do this forever.",Escape Plan

124,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,Stallone / Schwarzenegger pairing two of the 80's greatest action heroes together for the first time in an excellent prison action thriler,9,3 November 2019,"For the first time we got two of the greatest action heroes from the 80's together Stallone & Schwarzenegger in an prison action thriller Escape Plan. I like this film, I like this film better than Lock Up (1989). Lock Up was a decent Stallone movie but it was also a drama. Escape Plan is briliant action thriller from 2013. In my opinion it is last decent Scwharzenegger movie he did after The Last Stand. Directed was by Mikael Håfström which I never hear about it, but he did a decent job. I rather take Escape Plan over Lock Up just my opinion.Honestly in my opinion Escape Plan is a good prison movie, it is not an action movie itself from the 80's like Tango & Cash (1989) were. It is an action thriller about Ray Breslin (Stallone) skilled structure engineer who is brilliant, the best in his busnies. An escape artist who broked free from 14 maximum security prisons so far. If you ever watched Prison Break (2005) it was my favorite TV show of all time you will know what I am talking about and what this movie stands for. The first three seasons are awesome, Season 4 and 5 sucks in my opinion. Ray Breslin was like Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) just Michael did not kill anyone Ray shot the guards with a gun.Ray Breslin is a prison security expert whose specialty, as an under-cover inmate, is exposing weaknesses in high-security facilities by breaking out of them. Shortly after his most recent escape, he accepts a very lucrative deal to test the security of a ""black site"" facility designed to keep inconvenient, high-profile criminals permanently ""disappeared"". Once inside, it quickly becomes clear to Breslin that the contract was a set-up, and that this prison is destined to be his tomb. Using his skills, and with the help of fellow inmate Emil Rottmayer and a bit of good luck, Breslin plans to rise from this grave and seriously disappoint his malefactors.Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Scwarzenegger are excellent in their roles they are fantastic. Sly was in Lock Up and Tango & Cash in prison, Arnold was never in any prison movies so this is his first movie been in a prison. Vinnie Jones is in this movie is excellent as baddie Drake he was great. Jim Caviezel as Hobbes is also the maon baddie he was great villian. Sam Neill from Jurassic park I and III is in here as Dr. Kyrie. I am still wondering what happened to his character it was not explained. I wish there would be director's cut to explain what happened to Sam Neil. 50 Cent is in here, but he has a small minor role, he disappears from the rest of the movie and he appears in the finale. Vincent D'Onofrio is also good who later turns out he betrayed Ray and sent him to rott in prison. Amy Ryan as Abigail is in here as Ray's friend she is sexy, but this babe with 50 Cent is not in the movie much that's little disappointed.The movie it self is a solid, but it has problems: the movie becomes from time to time really boring. It goes slow really slow. The pacing is slow. Could have much more action scenes than they did. My favorite scene is Stallone firing with a Glock 21 on a guards in self defence, firing with M1911 pistol at Hobbes from the helicopter on the ship causing an explosion on board bad-ass. Great effect but it looked like CGI so I don't know if it was practical. That is mostly my favorite scene. How Breslin escapes under the ship is excellent excecuted and performed by a stunt double. I wish their would use some good soundtracks in this movie it lacks on music. I wish there would more action. I really like the finale, I really want to see DTV sequels Escape Plan 2: Hades and 2019's Escape Plan: The Extractors with Sylvester Stallone returning. I like Schwarzenegger with a machine gun FN M249 SAW firing on those bad guys guards he looks like Rambo in Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985).I like Escape Plan it is a good prison action thriller movie I like it, but it is not my favorite Stallone / Schwarzenegger film. I am glad we see Sly and Arnold for the first time together. I have this movie on Blu-ray disc this is the last movie from 2013 I own in my Stallone collection. I will get in 2 weeks Creed II on 4k Blu-ray disc and I am going to review it again If i will like it. I will watch and review Escape Plan 2: Hades next ,but I don't not know when and if I am going to watch Escape Plan 3: The Extractors. P",Escape Plan
125,ritera1,Really? You HAD to do this?,6,3 January 2014,"I never thought I'd say that Schwarzenegger did a better job acting than Stallone. Sure, Stallone is bad but Arnold is worse. (Arnold's freak-out in the cell where he ranted in German was actually interesting. Never seen him in a position of weakness.) I have enjoyed several of both men's movies, but you can't get blood from a stone.The story itself was confusing and silly. I was surprised that the Stallone character called ""uncle"" so soon. The first thing I thought in the prison was the set to that Peter Fonda 1970s movie ""Futureworld."" For a high-tech prison, Stallone and Arnold got away with a whole lot. And nothing really ever happened 'til the end. But that ending was very conventional and boring in itself.I've not seen 50-Cent in anything else but, OH MAN, he's a bad actor. The director has done some good films, but I didn't see anything special in this effort.",Escape Plan
126,luke-a-mcgowan,Good but 20 years late,5,5 February 2015,"Escape Plan is a movie best suited to low expectations. Sold entirely on a partnership between Stallone and Schwarzenegger, it feels like a surprisingly wasted opportunity considering how little chemistry the two have and how weak the writing is in places. That is not to say there is anything wrong with the performances or the plot - Schwarzenegger gives a surprisingly good performance (by his standards) and Stallone is always entertaining, even if his Demolition Man charisma is long in the past. Some of the supporting work from Amy Ryan, Jim Caviezel and Vincent D'Onofrio adds some legitimacy to the cast, even if it won't be getting a SAG Cast award nod by a long shot. The plot weaves between full of holes and surprisingly clever. The prison break scenes are easily the film's most entertaining, although some of the explanations are nonsensical and others not even made! The film makes a point of showing us extensive metal detectors that apparently are forgotten halfway through. The doctor character played by Sam Neill is the film's biggest deus ex machina and is rather sinful considering how much of the plot rests on his actions. However, Escape Plan is not a thoroughly negative experience, its just twenty years too late to capitalise on the Stallone-Schwarzenegger partnership.",Escape Plan
127,nicolechan916,A creative setting that made it pretty engaging.,7,16 June 2014,"The setting of the film is very creative, but I find myself more or less engaged in what is going on rather than actually comprehending what the story is about. Warden Hobbes (Jim Caviezel) is looking for this mafia person or something, but honestly I didn't fully follow all the talk. It was quite hard to understand what they were saying, especially Stallone with his trademark raspy voice. All the 'tough guy' talk being so macho and all makes it hard to hear what they're saying. I just followed the action.Props to Stallone and Schwarzenegger for making an action film at their age. It's probably time to give it up though. I'm getting kind of tired of watching guys fighting and shooting at each other for no apparent reason. Plus, this is such a hyper-masculine movie. I counted two women in this film. Two. Who never talk to each other and had only a few minutes of screen time. Fantastic.Well one thing that I did appreciate, was that they didn't swear as much as I would've expected. Usually with these hyper-masculine films, they would have the f-word in every sentence. I appreciate that this did not. The acting was pretty good too I guess.

128,doorsscorpywag,Please Stop!,1,9 January 2014,"For God's sake make Arnie the Head of the United Nations and make Sly his second in command. Anything to stop these two making anymore movies.Any human being with an intelligence that could outwit a lettuce surely cannot give this more than 2* even if they love the actors who star in it. It is utter rubbish from start to finish.The plot was ridiculous with Sly as the super escape artist who tested the prison system. Slys first escape utter nonsense. It involved the premise that the guards take little notice of the prisoners constructing aids to their escape and never think to search a prisoner when dumping him in solitary allowing him to carry all manner of escape goodies.His second one was a bit more involved and allowed the two stars to babble on about bugger all for half the film and then just do what they usually do and blast the crap out of everything and in doing so kill the 'bad' guy who was tasked to keep a bunch of scum away from decent folks. For a super efficient prison it beggars belief that nobody noticed Sly make a large complicated sextant and he and two other prisoners carried around concealed under their shirts.The film turned the good guy bad guy on its head and had the inmates, who let's face it were not there for parking violations, battling the 'evil' guards and warden who were half blind and terrible shots as per usual in any Sly/Arnie film. Sly cunningly seemed to be an expert about things which should really have been well above his remit but this knowledge was needed to formulate Slys much vaunted Plan B so it just happens. Stupid does not even cover it.It takes no brains to figure out what happens in the end as it is the same with all their movies. The whole thing was an insult to the intelligence of a halfwit even by their low standard.The acting was what you would expect of the likes of Sly, Arnie and Vinnie Jones but Jim Cavaziel did at least fly the flag for proper actors. Sadly though to no avail as the script was dire even for a Sly and Arnie movie.Hugely over rated by obviously the cast, crew and all their relatives and utterly forgettable. It could only have been worse if it had featured Robert DiNero who has recently debased himself even further by starring in a ridiculous boxing movie with Sly. Rocky 97 or some such garbage.One thing in the overtly left wing slant of this movie was that at least stuck in a cell the inmates would never have to watch a movie featuring these terrible caricatures of once decent action heroes.

But we digress. Sly plays an expert who professionally escapes prisons to test their security. He gets set-up and end's up in an experimental shadow prison from which he and Shwarzie have to escape. The film reminded me a bit of (and borrows elements from) Fortress and THX-1138. Contrary to The Expendables the film has a descent plot and is well made. The VFX are good and never look fake, so generally speaking a fine production. I expected little so I was positively surprised to see that it could deliver 2 hours of solid entertainment. It was never going to be as good as T2 or Cliffhanger but it's a pity it just flopped at the box office.

Though I do actually like a lot of Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Sylvester Stallone's stuff. I couldn't help but be seriously ageist. By thinking it was maybe a good 10 years to late for them to do an action movie ""team-up."" ""Escape plan"" though is what ""The Expendables"" (Which I didn't like much) wished it was. This doesn't feel like they tried too hard like ""The Expendables"" did in certain places. I always think a lot of these movies live or die on there ""cheesy"" one-liners. But ""Escape plan"" doesn't over do it. Consitrating more on making a movie, than making us laugh.Film sees these 2 80's action stars held up in a prison together, so the over the top action too, is limited. I'm not going to say that the flicks story is what gets it by, but as a big, dumb action move its still an entertaining one.

Editing follows that concept. The movie has a beginning and an end (not many nowadays do). Yes, sequel is possible, and I'm looking forward to it. Film was well written and don't expect too much of a dialogue (especially nothing emotional, moving or moral). They talk as much as it is necessary to go on. Of course, this is not a movie for any awards or something but pure entertainment, as you might expect. These guys will never be too old to be good in what they're doing.

132,ghost_dog86,"Sometimes, Jesus is just better as the bad guy",6,26 October 2013,"Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger should really team up permanently and start their own straight to DVD collection of B-action movies.Directed by Mikael Hafstrom (1408) ""Escape Plan"" sees Stallone playing a genius with a body builder's physique (essentially a roided out version of the character from ""A Beautiful Mind""). World renowned as someone who can escape from any prison known to man, he finds himself double crossed and locked up in a super top secret prison deemed escape proof, where the guards are all Jabbawockeez and the warden is the son of God. Oh and I almost forgot, his only friend inside is a former Mr. Olympia OK, so maybe I made this movie sound more interesting than it is, but that's not to say ""Escape Plan"" isn't without merit. And since everything about it is so self-aware in terms of its overall tone, as bad as the trailers looked, on an entertainment level, ""Escape Plan"" works.Arnold does take a backseat to Stallone (playing a sidekick of sorts) but gets to recite most of the laugh out loud one liners, which is fine by me. But it's Jim Caviezel (better known as Jesus Christ) who steals the show as the sadistic and comically serious warden. He is the best thing in this movie, giving a performance as if gunning for an Academy Award nomination, but playing a character that, in other hands, would be up for a Razzie. I know that doesn't make much sense, but it's unbelievably entertaining to watch.While my proclamation that ""Escape Plan"" holds entertainment value may astound you, it won't surprise anyone to hear that there are also flaws within this film; flaws that are all centered around the story. During the countless times ""Escape Plan"" stops to give exposition, I wish I had access to a fast forward button. And unfortunately, the first half is filled with boring plot nonsense. But the laughs and action 80's throwback sequences (especially near the end) are totally worth the journey. In short, don't pay attention to the storyline and you'll be fine.Final Thought: There are some critics I know who STILL believe that if a movie doesn't have a strong storyline then it can't possibly be entertaining. And once again those critics are wrong! Yes, if you're looking for a serious drama about a white guy whose ship gets highjacked by Somali pirates, then ""Escape Plan"" may not be up your alley. And while not as brilliantly nostalgic as ""The Expendables"", ""Escape Plan"" is still a generally fun B movie, if what your day has been missing is a movie with twenty minute action sequences where millions of rounds are fired and the hero miraculously escapes without a scratch.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

I started with Rambo and Kindergarten and went on with the rest of their movies. So as a fan, I had to watch this one. The movie ain't that great what it promises to be.The humor isn't that great. When a question is asked to a woman, whether she is a spy or not, she says no, worse, she is a lawyer. That is the level from what you can expect this movie to be. If this woman really was a lawyer, she definitely would not make fun of her own profession. That just would not make any sense. Made that point noticed, I found out that this woman is just an actress. So that makes the movie bit by bit less believable. It's like saying a hooker is working for your restaurant as a cook.Besides the bad humor the acting is very bad. Schwarzenegger is shaking his head when he is talking. Why? I can't remember he did that in his previous movies. What was 50cents doing in this movie? Stallone continuously trying to make a point that 50cents is a very smart man, why? 50cents is not an actor, he is a rapper. Please keep on rapping, I'm not listening to that crap so I'm not missing anything. But seeing this rapper act, is just a waste of my time. If they wanted to cast a black actor for this role, who does not play the leading role, why didn't they cast Marlon Wayans? Stallone and Schwarzenegger as two intelligent people, who try to escape this big prison, just does not make any sense. So why I gave this movie a six?

138,tr91,Solid film in all areas,8,22 October 2013,"'Escape Plan' is a film that I watched with low expectations and ended up thoroughly enjoying it. It is about Ray Breslin (Stallone) who puts prisons to the test for a living by going inside and seeing how difficult (or easy) it is to escape. He has help from the outside too.We see him escape from one prison at the start, the way in which he escapes is explained and shown in detail. This is really clever and sets the film up nicely. A really engaging and mysterious start. Once the movie has got going, the plot takes a twist. He has been set up and now he is faced with the seemingly impossible task of escaping from the most secret and secure prison ever. This is a daunting task (especially when you find out where it actually is), the prison looks great and you think there is surely no way out. It really gets you thinking in to the possibilities of what might be the way out.Once inside Stallone teams up with Emil Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger) as they plot their Escape Plan. It is a gripping story and Stallone and Arnie make a great team. The supporting cast was also very good with lots of familiar faces, even 50 Cent wasn't bad.There is some really brutal fight and torture type scenes as well as the big muscle type action we're used to from these guys. The shoot out is really impressive, just pure action towards the end. Add this to the general tone of the movie (suspenseful thriller) and it really is a good mix. There was also some bits of comedy thrown in for good measure, some especially good one-liners.Overall it was a bit far fetched in places but not completely predictable. It was a solid film in pretty much every aspect. Very good action and mystery as well as good acting throughout. It's never going to go down as a classic but for what it is, it was really enjoyable. It felt like I was watching Stallone and Arnie from the 80's, they haven't changed much! I would recommend this film to anyone.'BOOOOOM' 'Have a lovely day, *******.8/10.",Escape Plan

The film did have some awesome explosive action and great acting by some great actors. There wasonly one thing that was not good about the film, that stopped it from being an excellent film and was very weird and unusual to look at. That was when Stallones character Ray Breslin and Schwarzeneggers Emil Rottmayer are being incarcerated in prison and are surrounded by powerful security guards. The way the the security guards were dressed in black uniforms and wearing black masks made these guys look very weird and unusual and not look like proper security guards, but more like robots. Other than this fault, the film was an awesome with some awesome action and great acting by Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jim Caviezel, Amy Ryan, Sam Neill, Vincent D'Onofrio, and 50 Cent.",Escape Plan

TOtally preposterous. and i'm just supposed to overLOOK this stuff? OK. one or two situations(and it's a fairly simple story, truth be told...). but it felt like there was just enough intelligence in the story to make it acceptable to a large number of people. that and no more. i was severely underwhelmed and am glad to get the chance to tell whoever might listen. it's sad cause like i said, there's been lots of movies with/by these guys that i really enjoyed. and then there's the waste of sam neill's talent in a throwaway role. did i say how disappointing this movie was?",Escape Plan
141,BrickNash,"Solid film, great cast but just a bit too slow with not enough intelligence to make up for it",7,6 March 2014,"Having just freshly seen this film I was eager to write a review of it.This is the first proper double team film of Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger in lead roles, although Stallone does take more of the screen time.First off, yes it's a good film.......it's a really good film! A classy thriller type affair with all the gloss you could imagine and a great cast all round. Arnie does a surprisingly decent acting turn this time around and there is a refreshing lack of crappy Expendable type in jokes between Sly and Arnie which was a big relief for me. It's good stuff all round but I can't help feel that the main stars do carry it a bit because it has some flaws. For a start it's quite slow, far far too slow to be holding the two giants of 80's OTT action and while the Shawshank Redemption style of the film is appreciated its never quite realised. The film is not as intelligent as it thinks it is or would like to be. Some great scenes which could have been really suspenseful lacked emphasis on the clock ticking and there are large sections of the film where you do wonder ""is anything going to happen?""Thankfully the chemistry between the two main stars really works and the film isn't totally devoid of action. A bit more could have been used of Vinnie Jones who makes a pretty brutal first appearance and a little more thought into the complexity of the actual escape sprinkled with just a dash more balls out action would have made this a firm classic.As it stands it's a fine, solid film and it's great to see Arnie firmly back on the scene and with Sly too so do yourself a favour and check it out but don't expect much repeat value out of it",Escape Plan
142,TheRadiobox,Escapes cliche and keeps a straight face,7,11 January 2021,"Escape Plan was directed by Mikael Hafstrom, written by Miles Chapman and Jason Keller, and stars Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jim Caviezel, Faran Tahir, Vinnie Jones, Sam Neill, Amy Ryan, 50 Cent, and Vincent D'Onofrio. It follows a prison specialist and a prisoner as they try to break out of a secret prison.The plot: Escape Plan's story is of pretty high concept and makes few detours, creating a fun and fascinating meat-and-potatoes game of smarts and endurance. After breaking out of a prison, Ray (Stallone) meets with a CIA lawyer and his own team: businessman Lester (D'Onofrio), assistant Abigail (Ryan), and hacker Hush (50) about testing a private facility. He accepts and is taken but his transponder is cleaved out, waking up in a glass box surrounded by faceless guards. Ray is ""introduced"" to warden Hobbes (Caviezel) and guard Drake (Jones), who refuse to let Ray go. Realizing that he's dead in the water, Ray teams up with fellow prisoners Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger) and Javed (Tahir), with some help from the prison doctor, Kyrie (Neill); all in an effort to circumvent the book he wrote and escape (plan).The characters: Most of the characters are good enough. While the main characters are decently interesting, the side characters are pretty bland and their subplots far less interesting. Ray is solid; a professional escape artist, he has a seemingly infinite pocket of ideas as to how to ascertain escape routes, create tools, and navigate confined areas. These skills paired with a strong ability to appeal to emotion make him interesting and easy to root for. Rottmayer is a magnetic presence. A man with seemingly nothing to lose, he helps in whatever way he can, regardless of risk. Armed with an acute ability to piss people off, he's a strong asset to Ray (literally). Hobbes is a control freak with a knack for collection, eager to illustrate his power, his first choice is torture, and his backup is negotiation. There's a domineering coldness to him with a Bond-esque element of cheese. All the others fill out their roles well but aren't special. Performances are very good all across the board, although Stallone does play his role too seriously at times, and Caviezel a bit heavy.The thrills: Excitement is abound in the prison. The one thing Hobbes allows i suppose. Ray's escape in the first 10 minutes gives an excellent idea of what the man can do and what he can create with such a limited amount of help and resources; and once he gets stuck in the prison with Rottmayer, it's extremely arresting and hard to look away. From using the wax lining of cardboard milk cartons to expanding steel with the use of toothpaste, there's never a lack of curious contraptions and schemes to come from Ray and Rottmayer. Even when the movie isn't focused on makeshift tools, the things that Hobbes does to the both of them, like putting them in metal boxes with searing lights, and waterboarding; there's never an easy task or a dull moment. What makes all of this even better is the realism of the methods that Ray and Rottmayer use; since the producers and writer consulted prison experts and studied real prison breaks, it all feels plausible.The technics: Technically the movie is pretty good. Production design is the most notable thing that Escape Plan has to offer aside from the very good writing. A cold steely atmosphere combined with the glass cells and demoralizing color palette (the place is mostly blue and grey with spatters of yellow); the look and feel of what's essentially a top secret trash can is attained with ease. Pacing is also above average, with very few moments in the movie that don't serve a purpose, there's never a reason to look away. Some issues are present but take little from the movie overall. While the practical stuff is good, there's some bad CGI from time to time. It's mostly related to exterior shots, but it can be distracting. Hobbes' comeuppance is a bit weak and the subplot with Ray's team isn't as involving, though thankfully the movie steers away from it for long periods of time. It all comes out well in the end.Escape Plan strictly denies cliche in lieu of realism. Thanks to large doses of creativity, a star-studded cast, and a strong sense of place; there's always something interesting going on, even if the movie ends up where you'd expect it to.73/100",Escape Plan
143,highmarksreviews,A forgettable but entertaining prison break,6,21 January 2018,"Prison Break had potential. A much awaited team-up between some accomplished action stars, shiny set pieces and an intriguing premise. The execution is sloppy, but still entertaining on occasion. Its premise is never fully explored and mostly glossed over and the plot is utterly predictable. Most of the action won't really make jaws drop, but Schwarzenegger and Stallone give dedicated performances. You won't remember most of it, but you'll definitely enjoy it.",Escape Plan
144,Condemned-Soul,Legendary action heroes Schwarzenegger and Stallone star... and that's more than enough!,8,5 August 2017,"Escape Plan is an action thriller that stars Sylvester Stallone as Ray Breslin, a structural engineer whose job is to test the reliability of maximum security prisons by posing as an inmate from the inside. But when he is set up and incarcerated for real in a supposedly inescapable prison in the middle of nowhere, he must plot a way out using the help of fellow prisoner Emil Rottmayer (Arnold Schwarzenegger). And so the stage is set for the legendary duo to at first butt heads and then formulate a partnership against ridiculous odds. Strictly for fans of classic old-school action stars Arnie and Stallone, you will know what you're in for, and won't be disappointed by the end. It's a nostalgic trip back to B-movie, 80's actioners of the past, complete with the invincible bullet shielded heroes, fisticuff drama and typical wisecracks to match; preposterously gleeful in equal measure that is sure to put smiles on die-hard fans of the genre. It's a smarter film than you'd think too, with a few surprises up its sleeve, though you won't be shocked to witness Schwarzenegger command a heavy machine gun to mow down waves of disposable, arcade-like enemies before the credits roll (as he's reliably done so many times in his action-dominated filmography). Like I said, it will appeal to a specific group of film-goers who want a dose of an aging genre back in their lives, and that's more than enough to warrant a recommendation. With a solid supporting cast including Sam Neill, Vincent D'Onofrio and Jim Caviezel to sit in the shadow of our heroes as they hatch a clever way out, Escape Plan lives up to the promise of its title while hearkening back to times gone by. And it's hard to resist the on-screen team-up of Stallone and Schwarzenegger and the great chemistry it inevitably entails. And who doesn't want to see Terminator and Rambo in the same movie?! 8/10!",Escape Plan

It's not as good as 'The Rock' but it's still pretty decent.Stallone and Schwarzenegger are exactly as you'd expect - perfect as character actors but the performances are not exactly nuanced! There are a few other big names including Sam Neill, Vinnie Jones and 50 Cent, but unfortunately none of them get much screen time and they feel a bit wasted in this movie. Jim Caviezel was good as the bad guy.The plot ticks along very nicely. It's exciting, lots of action, and fun watching them trying to work out how to escape. I thought it could have delivered a little bit more on the complexity of the escape plan - I'm oversimplifying a bit but when it came down to it they basically just created a distraction, shut down the power and left through a hatch. It would have been nice to be treated to something a little more subtle. But hey, I still enjoyed it.",Escape Plan

It is, when push comes to shove a quite good action movie, with a decent plot and reasonable acting.Whats even more interesting is the philosophical aspect of it all, since it may not be an impossible thought/idea that such prisons could become a reality in the near future. Don't misunderstand me. I don't have any problem with a privately run facility, as long as human rights are kept, and laws are followed.I do, however, oppose this general idea, where anyone at anyones wish can be incarcerated for a sum of money. Doesn't matter if they have committed heinous crimes. Human rights must be observed.",Escape Plan

Fortunately movie finds self irony and do not try to be too serious. At best moments movie is very suspenseful like Prison Break was in it best episodes. Stallone's and Schwarzenegger's charisma works greatly together. There are some nice quotes through entire film. Ones like ""You hit like a vegetarian"" which will most likely stays live forever. Movie isn't any piece of art, but it won't even try to be that. Script is quite clever and offers few surprises too. Shooting and blasting at the end may be a little too much, but that probably is it intention. Movie works as a basic action rumble movie. Jim Caviezel makes fine work as a sadistic prison warden. Stallone and Schwarzenegger mumble their lines with great self irony. Great movie for autumn afternoon solace.",Escape Plan

150,bravesfanc,Fun action film,7,26 March 2014,"I was bored and this seemed to be the logical choice to pass the time and I'm glad I chose this movie. It won't win any awards but for 2 hours I was entertained from start to finish. Stallone plays ""Ray Breslin"" who breaks out of prisons for a living. He does this for a company he co created. The business is to make the prisons ""escape proof"". He's done this for 8 years and the opening 10 minutes or so we see how he does it.He then gets another offer to an ""off the grid"" location where the most lethal criminals are being held. He's told that he pretty much won't be able to escape. His partner is the one who really wants this to happen because he will be paid a hefty sum of money. Usually when he goes to the prisons, he has outside contact and a tracker to let his team know where he is at all times. Not this time though as his tracker is plucked from his arm.He wakes up in a very small, see through room and we see how big the place really is. You can sense that he is a bit nervous in the beginning. He then becomes friends with Arnold Schwartzenegger character. They hit if off and work together. From there the story really picks up and you wonder how in the world he is going to figure it out.Jim Caveziel is the bad guy and a good one at that. It's his operation and he's designed this place based on a book written by Stallone's character. Now that he has Breslin in his prison, he doesn't want to let him out. There are a few twists as well, I saw one of them coming but the ending got me pretty good. If you enjoy Stallone and Schwartzenegger you will enjoy this film.",Escape Plan

Dialogues and sequence are really well written. Main characters bring you in the movie and Jim Caviezel is brilliant as the villain in this film he really play a cold Ruthless money hungry warden & Vince Jones was his usual character hard ass nut case and the rest of the characters blending the story pretty well, I will say there are moment that will have you laughing because it dose have the odd comical moments that even I laugh out loud to.Although I would say that IMDb slightly under rated this film as I think it at least more than a 7.6 on the story alone it has about 3 twist in the storyline & you never see the ending coming but some moment you can see it come as there is a lot of deception being made in the film which was seriously brilliant for the film, it gave it its edge.I wasn't expecting this film to be quiet as good as it looked from the trailer but after watching this film I was pleasantly surprised that it was a brilliant film & totally worth going to watch.",Escape Plan
153,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn review,6,18 October 2013,"If you've been reading my reviews, you've might have noticed that I'm somewhat of an Arnold Schwarzenegger fan. However, I was never big on his Escape Plan co-star and buddy, Sylvester Stallone. When I heard of their collaboration in Escape Plan (they've been planning a collaboration since the 1980s), I was somewhere in between of wanting to and not wanting to watch it. Nonetheless, the concept of the movie seemed interesting enough for me to actually go see it after all. I didn't expect much from it, but in the end I was pleasantly surprised and thoroughly entertained.Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) is a professional escape artist – he escapes from prisons for money, in order to test their security. One day he gets an offer from the CIA to break from the world's most secured, illegal, off the books prison that holds some of the most dangerous prisoners in the world. He accepts the offer but is betrayed – he finds out this is not a job but someone payed to have him kept in there forever. Upon entering prison he meets Rottmayer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) whom he befriends and with whom he tries to break free.Escape Plan is a rather entertaining movie. A stupid, silly, confusingly acted, overblown movie – but still an entertaining movie. While the concept of escaping from an inescapable prison is always interesting, Stallone and Schwarzenegger take it to a new level. Escape Plan, in spite of looking serious from time to time, is still a generic action movie that doesn't take itself seriously and has a lot of self-deprecating humor (including one scene in which Arnold yells gibberish and prays in German). All the bad things in this movie have a certain trashy/it's-so-bad-it's-good quality. Especially the villains in the movie, who are fun and over the top – Jim Caviezel, whose character looks like he came out of a comic book, is great as the butterfly-collecting (the man collects butterflies!), possibly homosexual, ruthless warden Hobbes, and Vinnie Jones is exaggerated as always as the guard Drake. The two leads – Schwarzenegger and Stallone – are on auto-pilot mode throughout the movie, just doing what they mastered through the years, and what they are loved for – being bad asses. The only one that stands out in the movie for being just terrible is Curtis Jackson, aka 50 cent. I don't know why he's in the movie but one thing is for sure – he's unwatchably terrible, in a bad way.Actually, I don't know why 50 cent's character, Hush, was even in the movie, nor do I see the importance of Amy Ryan's character Abigail. These two weren't crucial to the plot, and it would have been much better if the majority of their screen time was cut out so the plot doesn't wander off from the prison setting. This could have improved the movie's pace and mystery even more. Speaking of prisons, while I do think that the scenes inside the prisons were decent, I don't think that Escape Plan exploited the potential of a setting inside an unbreakable prison enough. In the end, the whole prison setting seemed – in lack of a better word – not particularly developed (the nature of the prison, the inmates, the guards, etc.). All in all, like I said before, Escape Plan is a silly, fun, dumb, cheesy popcorn flick that, what it lacks in intelligence, it makes up for in its entertainment value.Rating: 6/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/",Escape Plan
154,CowherPowerForever,Have a Lovely Day.....,8,22 October 2013,"Over 20 years in the making Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger finally have their own film together and the result is very good.Mikael Håfström who has brought us some good films such as 1408 and The Rite directs this action film with action legends Stallone and Schwarzenegger. The story is well thought out and overall executed very well. In which Jason Keller(Machine Gun Preacher) and Miles Chapman(first major film) deserve credit for writing such a good film as well. The story becomes boring at times here and there but nothing too distracting or overwhelming. This film is fun and interesting and the actors do such a great job working together.Other than Stallone and Schwarzenegger this film has a great surrounding cast starring Jim Caviezel, Vincent D'Onofrio, Sam Neill, and Amy Ryan. This acting team works well together especially the three main characters Stallone, Schwarzenegger, and Caviezel. The film is downright hilarious at times but nothing over the top however you will leave the theater reciting hilarious lines from Schwarzenegger. Schwarzenegger dominates his role however while I approve of the performance of Stallone it was nothing special. Caviezel is one of the better villains we have seen on the big screen in recent times and he continues to prove that he is one of the best actors in Hollywood today.Overall this is a downright fun and exciting action film starring two legends of the genre.

156,The_moan_of_all_moans,Nostalgia aside; horrible.,3,31 October 2013,"Sometimes Nostalgia can cloud ones mind and the fact that this movie is averaging at around a 7 is a clear indication of that. But if you neglect that need for nostalgia, then all you are left with is a foul movie. I, like any other welcomed the prospect of Stallone and Schwarzenegger in the same movie, but then i seen the trailer....and then i read the plot....and then i watched the trailer again....and eventually i had lost interest.Yes, it was obvious from the announcement that it wasn't going to be a mind blowing spectacle of acting, but they could have at least came up with something original. Nevermind the fact that i almost chewed my face off at Arnie's role as ""the favour guy"" as Stallone so expertly put it....it was like a deteriorating, rusted, blob of waste compared to Morgan Freeman as RED from Shawshank. And i know there is basically no point in comparing their acting abilities, but at the end of the day it is a film....and a film consists of actors/actresses....who are supposed to act....and unless Arnie is a machine (literal or in human form) then he fails. The ""comedy"" between him and Stallone was mind numbing, but what do you expect from Rocky and a Terminator.The two live off of their past status, so when they decide to star in a film together...all the Rocky fans and all the Terminator fans find themselves in a tizzy and choose to disregard the fact that they are both a complete tragedy when it comes to acting. Instead choosing to succumb to nostalgia. As i said it can cloud the mind.Now, back to the unoriginal factor it carries. And that is not in relation to Shawshank or all prison break films....but one. Anybody remember ""Lock Up""? Yes that starred Sylvester Stallone as well...where he was very good at breaking out of prisons....so he ends up being wrongly transferred from one prison to another (a slight difference in how he gets there but still very similar).... there he is greeted with a warden who has a hidden agenda......and is mentally and physically tortured ..... ah very similar indeed. So in conclusion this film is basically ""Lock Up"" with a rubbish RED in it.Even with the two disasters aside, the acting doesn't really have any saving grace, i mean Vinnie Jones?....50 cent? Not exactly a strong cast. Donald Sutherland.....(sorry that's Lock Up) i mean Jim Caviezel plays an OK part as the wicked warden, but apart from that there is nothing. The action is what would be expected; exaggerated. The comedy is cheesy and the plot is placid and predictable.If you're starved for nostalgia then this is the movie to feed that hunger, but for me it was and is a recipe for disaster.3/10",Escape Plan

The skin on his face looks like silicone. I kept wondering if the make-up people on the set couldn't do something more to make him look more human. His acting also seems to be getting worse with age.Stallone as usual was unconvincing and uninteresting. It seems like he's half asleep throughout the entire movie. He is just way too old to play the characters that he no doubt writes for himself. The movie was just about 2 old farts acting brawny and throwing punches. We all loved them in the 80's and 90's but they're just way too old to play the part of an action hero. I must say, it was a pleasant surprise to hear Arnie speaking in his native tongue.

159,YJLcool,"an engaging, entertaining 'old-school' action thriller",7,4 November 2013,"While its not the best prison break themed film ever made, Escape plan proved to be an engaging, entertaining 'old-school' action thriller. It successfully delivers the bloody, exaggerated, highly entertaining action that still manage to provide the thrills and some unexpected plot twists despite the simplicity and straightforward nature of the film (seriously, I don't expect to have twists in an Arnold-Stallone action film). The two veteran actors did their best, provided decent acting performances and performed mostly all their action stunts on their own throughout the film. Just imagine ourselves at the age of 66 (Stallone) or 67 (Arnold) doing the same action stunts that they doing now...It's very impressive (not to mention they still manage to maintain well- trained ripped muscular bodies).Action junkies or long-time Arnold/Stallone fans don't need to worry as the film is action-packed and fast-paced as well. I'm not fully sure whether there are plot holes or inconsistencies in the prison break plan (just watched the film once), but the plan should believable enough for the average movie viewers. However, there are many unrealistic scenes throughout the film...There's too many shooting scenes where Ray and Emil managed to easily escape unscathed, despite all the guns shooting around in the scene. But in certain scenes, Ray managed to accurately fire his gun from a distance...Furthermore, the whole prison shouldn't explode when Ray (Stallone) shoots through the oil barrels with guns. Nowadays, people should well aware of the fact that explosions shouldn't have happened as oil barrels were just oils and a gun bullet would not able to trigger a considerable spark or gas to trigger a massive explosion. It is also not possible to unlock a door with a gunshot without getting hit by the bullet itself. For a maximum security prison, all the CCTV cameras should not be connected to a single network (opening up one single camera can switch off all the other cameras in the entire prison is a bit ridiculous).Overall, despite all that, this is one of the relaxing, entertaining action film to watch just to reminiscent the good old days.

It's great to see Sly and Arnie in the same film, after both had dominated the genre with their Rambo and Terminator movies in the 30 years prior to this one, and they bounce off each other perfectly, although Escape Plan is not as explosive or as dynamic as you might expect from the coming together of two icons.Ably supported by Jim Caviezel, 50 Cent, Sam Neil and Vinnie Jones who help to raise this above the average action flick, this is a lot better than expected considering the advancing ages of the two stars who manage to carry it all off convincingly.Director Mikael Håfström (1408) delivers some great action set pieces, tense moments and non-stop thrills to make this a solid two hours of escapist entertainment.",Escape Plan
161,edlc1970,"Good movie, just to bad 50 cent is in it",1,15 July 2021,"First of all, this is a good action movie, with two of my favorit actors, Sly and Arnie. And it is ok entertaining. But with 50 cent in the movie, it just ruins everything. He cannot act. And is also just a mediocre singer. Why make a good action packed movie, with Sly and Arnie, and then put 50 cent in the cast as well??? I dont get it. I would have rated this movie a lot higher, had it not been for 50 cent.",Escape Plan
162,moviescoundrel,Not a bad Escape,7,23 October 2013,"The plot (POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILER): Stallone is a private security company owner whose job is to test security at prisons. Ironically, one of the newest, best, prisons needs to be tested. Cue Stallone, except when he gets there, things aren't as he expected, he has no extraction code, and things are grim. He soon runs into an inmate named Schwarzenegger and a rather nasty warden.The review: Breslin (Stallone), Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger), Hobbes (Caviezel)- I was expecting this one to be very cheesy, and it was surprisingly quite slim on cheese. The plot is lame and predictable, but the execution and cast here is pretty entertaining. The idea of trying to figure out how to escape and the details in escaping as far as materials, timing, guard routes, etc. were pretty interesting although I'm not sure if any of it is accurate. The dialogue between Breslin (Stallone) and Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger) was a bit cheesy but not awful. It was awful to try and interpret was Stallone was saying most of the time as he talks like he's chewing cotton. The action sequences were also not the best part here. Two 60 year old muscle men fighting each other and fighting others just looks and sounds so bad, even with stunt doubles doing the work. Some of the movie is realistic but then these scenes happen, such as the grand finale with unlimited security guards and unlimited bullets in Schwarzeneggers gun. While not a total waste, this one's fun for a bit, then forgettable.",Escape Plan
163,billcarr31,Summary above is incorrect,8,13 May 2017,"Breslin did not design the prison himself. Hobbes designed the prison based on the book of Breslin's research.

I like it, I recommend it.It has a very cleverly designed, solid script. The fact that legends such as Arnold and Silvester also feature while this is quite enough makes the movie even better.It is a great escape movie with a very cleverly scripted script, an immersive story to the end, and a full-dose action. You will watch it breathlessly with the great acting of Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger.The movie is simply great, but as a muslim, I am quite uncomfortable with the (supposedly) muslim profile reflected here and I am embarrassed frankly. Unfortunately, this character who kills the man in the movie, kills, swears, uses drugs, lies, and is integrated and reflected by many more immoralities has unfortunately not anything to do with real Islam or Muslim morality.

166,DubhDoo,Does what it says on the tin,6,3 November 2013,"Arnie and Sly are together at last. 'Escape Plan', the latest movie from Mikael Hăfström, is notable for being the first major on screen pairing of Schwarzenegger and Stallone, after brief cameos in 'The Expendables' series. Here, Stallone plays Ray Breslin, a professional jailbird, who after breaking out of every prison designed by man, is sent to a prison designed especially for him to see if he can break out. Unfortunately, Breslin soon realises that this isn't a job – he has been genuinely abandoned in a prison that is ""off the grid"". To get out, he must team up with Schwarzenegger and come up with an escape plan. There is action and one-liners aplenty. Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson plays the stereotypical black sidekick. Vinnie Jones plays the same person he's been playing for years. Jim Caviezel plays the ridiculous villain who paints butterflies in his downtime. And Sam Neill appears to be wondering where he is and how he got there. But even with perfunctory direction from Hăfström, 'Escape Plan' makes no pretensions about what it is and says what it does on the tin – it's a delightfully fun and thoroughly enjoyable slab of 'geri-action'.",Escape Plan
167,marcotiero,Big guns of the 80s!,7,15 June 2020,"Finally we get Arnold and Sly in a movie together (properly) after all these years, though it would have been awesome if it happened when they were in their prime.The movie is entertaining, and an interesting take on prison movies as Ray (Stallone) isn't the usual ""framed guy locked up"" but an expert on prison design, and this time he's incarcerated in a prison built using his guidelines, which makes it virtually impossible to escape from. The story itself isn't that original (escaping from prison has been done numerous times in movie) but this is quite an interesting way of telling the story.However, at some points in the movie, it feels rather slow paced (especially at the start) and there's not a lot of action considering who is in the movie. On the plus side, both main stars have the charisma and chemistry that you watch along with them and they carry the movie. The supporting cast is also really good, with Curtis Jackson surprising me as a relatively mild mannered character, very different from what you'd expect of 50 Cent.",Escape Plan
168,gunn-wrights,Stallone and Arnold in the SAME movie!! How can you go wrong?,8,24 February 2021,"Under normal circumstances, I would have given this movie a solid 7 (where most viewers ranked it). Maybe it's because I'm old, but Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger have been the 2 biggests icons from my childhood/teen years (along with Bruce Willis, then this movie would have been a 9 - LOL)Not much to say about the movie itself, you know the 2 co-stars, you know the movies they're good at making - well, this is an action, fighting, solving the impossible, and killing everyone type movie you'd expect from them. And I personally LOVED IT!HIGHLY RECOMMEND",Escape Plan
169,DarthPaul85,Not bad for a genre flick.,7,18 October 2013,"Movies like this can be utter trash, or a popcorn-munching good time. Escape Plan is much closer to the latter, but not without its flaws.I think it's impossible not to compare this movie to The Expendables, and I have to say, I thought Expendables 2 was better than Escape Plan. So if you're going into this hoping it will be Expendables 3, you may be disappointed. That said, there are some great scenes in this movie, and it's a different genre than Expendables anyway. Expendables is more action- comedy, and Escape Plan is just action. The cinematography is actually quite good- it doesn't ""try too hard"" like a lot of modern movies do. It knows how to be shot, how to present a story, and it does it well. Stallone and Schwarzenegger are great- their ""chemistry"" is much easier to take here than in Expendables, and Arnold is finally getting back into the swing of these movies again. Stallone never misses a beat, and continues to play his tried-and-true quiet tough-guy role. It is Arnold who gives us the comic relief in this film, and we're thankful for that, because without it the film would truly sink a few notches in rating.Also a great performance by Jim C as the villain. He made the character a James Bond-worthy bad guy, and I enjoyed him a lot. Also, Sam Neil. Yeah, what? He's in this too! Though probably not more than 4 minutes of screen time, but he definitely leaves a strong impression on the film too. It's hard to talk about the movie itself without some spoilers, so I'll just say that it delivers what it promises- a straightforward ""watch the hero try to get out of this mess"" film that doesn't try to be more than it is (thankfully). My complaints are pretty small- though I applaud the movie for keeping things simple, I think they could've developed the characters a little more. Conversely, it also goes out of its way to explain some things that it doesn't need to. In fact, sometimes it just makes things more confusing by trying to explain them. So overall, there's just a sense that this ""could've been better,"" but at the same time, it could've been much worse. I didn't get that ""blood pumping rooting for the hero"" feeling as much as I wanted, but I did enjoy watching the events unfold on screen. And that's really all you can ask for.",Escape Plan
170,Valkonian,Decent flick- see it for Arnold's scenes,7,5 May 2021,Arnold's scenes in this are some I'd the best. The scene where he's screaming in German is hilarious. Decent movie with good pace. Nice twists.,Escape Plan

Its story is somewhat original but in the way it is present it is a bit clichéd. Stallone and Schwarzenegger have a great n screen chemistry that one only wished they would have explored sooner at younger points in their respective careers. They both do what they do best and do a decent job here. The pacing of the film is good though a little disjointed in some areas. One feels when watching this film that it could have been more but was far better than what some have labeled a boring one tone one dimensional film. Its worth a watch and has a decent plot, the climax of the film is where the action gets revved up and it will get you pumped as it plays out, if of course you can suspend belief. It is easy to lose investment in the characters if you are not following it with your interests and attention open. All in all it was an enjoyable film with a decent story, good acting and a somewhat disjointed pacing of the film.",Escape Plan

173,imdb-45,Horrendous. Bad self tribute,1,19 April 2015,"You know a movie is terrible when even the small things that aren't needed are so poorly contrived. Example - somehow all the closed circuit TV cameras in a high security prison are not only connected to the same network, but jiggling a few wires in one camera means all the cameras will show the same picture and the entire network can go offline? Huh? Watching Arnie run in slow motion was sad. These guys should just pack it up already. They had a great run as action heroes and no matter how great Hollywood effects are these days, the camera angles, missing or partially concealed camera shots cannot hide their age and limitations. Make no mistake, this movie with the dumbest of plots, ridiculous lines and impossible to believe escape (where the bad guys can't hit anything) is just a self tribute to themselves. I am so glad that I only caught the last 30 minutes of this film because to waste all that time for such a pitiful climax would be more disappointing than never having seen the film at all.Continuity issues abound everywhere. In one scene a necessary part of the escape is shot. He can't move at all in order to escape. Yet somehow he's able to perform incredible feats of strength and withstand excess gunfire to help our heroes on their mission. And when ladders are half shot out with only one half still intact, somehow the ladder is fully intact when necessary and is swung around... watch for it.Cavaziel does what he can with a horrendously funny script. There is a reason this movie bombed completely in theaters and don't think it's any better on cable. Time for Stallone and Terminator to pack it in or turn to drama, if they can act in anything but action hero movies. This one is painful to watch.",Escape Plan

178,ActionFan-Reviews,Schwarz-allone: An Action Fans Dream Movie,6,20 October 2013,"2013 has been a great year for throwback retro 80/90's action movies (The last stand, bullet to the head, olympus has fallen). Escape plan fits nicely with those movies as if they came out 15-20 years ago they'd be sitting in a box with the rest of your VHS flicks. The two last names Schwarzenegger and Stallone across a poster has been waited on for decades and the two prove they can still kick ass. the two have good chemistry and Arnie steals the show. Arnold's great dialogue is hilarious as usual and nostalgic to hear his one liners again. It takes time for the action to get going but The last half hour sure packs the action in ,with Arnie and Sly finally joining forces to kick ass!! one scene in particular involving Arnold and a machine gun is reminiscent of the great 80's action flick ""Commando"". Although the plot is nicely set up as the trailer shows, it feels slow at times and takes a twist at the end which was unnecessary. More action scenes with the two would have been better. Overall, as a long time fan of the 80/90's action movies it was enjoyable. if your a fan of similar tastes who enjoyed these actors movies when you were a kid, this is for you.6/10",Escape Plan

There must be some process though I'm sure it's not this one!A good mix of action along with the story, saved the movie from the not-so-great Sly and Arnie acting.

Actually the movie began so cheesy that after 15 minutes of watching, I considered shutting it off... I'm glad that I didn't most likely because I had no enough time to start another movie that night. Honestly speaking the movie had some descent 90s style action, a refreshment to the memory but in no way comparable to the original. Arnold was in his worst shape and he was never a good actor, his body used to act and the body is gone so a retirement with dignity would be a viable option for him to consider. Sylvester was in better shape but seriously, both of them are awful actors and close to their 70s, I don't enjoy seeing them on big screen anymore however the most annoying thing in the movie was the dull whispering hard to hear conversations between key characters. Not Arnold's voice nor Sylvester's are sharp and clear enough for whispering and it was a feature length whisper. Trying not to draw attention of guards, they had to keep the volume down so I recommend to watch this movie with subtitles otherwise you have to rewind some scenes and try to hear what they say... I would say an unnecessary and unpleasant interruption. Anyways, some occasions require cheesy entertainment and here is your cheesy brainless entertainment!",Escape Plan
181,simonpcpearson,past its sell by date,2,30 October 2013,"The Escape Plan is a throwback to a bygone era, and it feels like one. The movie industry has thankfully moved on from the lazy dumb action movies that were so prevalent thirty years ago. That is not to say that the current crop of action flicks are works of art,they are not, but they are products of their time. Escape Plan feels as if it is a product of the Eighties, and it is difficult to find the appeal of such a past its sell by date product.Sylvester Stallone is apparently reluctant to face his old age. He tries to act as though he is a young man, but there is no amount of cosmetics and hairpieces that will disguise the fact that he is too old for roles like this.Arnie comes across slightly better. Like his role in The Last Stand, his character feels age appropriate and he is having fun in his over the top portrayal.Pacing is a problem. There is a long tedious section in the middle which seems to go on forever. The end brightens up with an okayish action sequence, but the effect is spoiled by some silly moments and an incredibly lame one-liner.Wait for the DVD.",Escape Plan
182,gemandeye1,Smart start. Good action. Lost points for the clichés.,6,13 March 2017,"Overall I enjoyed this movie. I put off watching it after it bombed in the theaters. The other night I was wanting an action movie so revisited thee IMDb site and saw some stellar (10 out of 10) reviews and sad let's give this a shot. Stallone actually acting is one of his better roles in this one. Not on par with Cop Land or Rocky but up there. He balances the tough guy with intelligence with an even easy flow that's believable. Arnold on the other hand, who has never really been known as a great actor even though I think he did his best real acting in Maggie, seems to just walk through his lines and rest on the fact that he's n action movie icon so why put in the effort. Jim Caviezel playing out of character playing a Bond type villain with a bit of corniness, and I say that as a compliment, as he did so very well. THe premise of the movie is great. The attempt at being a smart action movie almost works. Thee were times it just decided to become a cliché of your typical brainless action movie. I like some of those. Stallone's Expendables being one. If this would have stayed on the path of that intelligent action movie this could've been a box office hit and a memorable film. Most people I have mentioned this movie to never even head of it or forgot it totally and they are fans of the genre, Stallones, and/or Arnold's. Sadly, This is an easily forgettable movie.

183,BrentHankins,"Nowhere close to perfect, but a hell of a lot of fun.",7,17 October 2013,"Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger shared a few scenes in both installments of the Expendables franchise, but Escape Plan marks the first time the two legendary actions stars have headlined a film together, and it feels somewhat poetic that this team-up should be so reminiscent of the films on which both men built their careers.Stallone stars as Ray Breslin, a security expert whose entire career has been built around pointing out the flaws in maximum security prisons - by getting himself incarcerated and then breaking out of them. His reputation gets him a meeting with the CIA, who want Ray to go undercover inside a privately funded penitentiary which houses the most dangerous criminals and terrorists in the world, an off-the-books facility known as The Tomb.Unfortunately for Ray, the entire thing is a setup, and now he's trapped on the inside at the mercy of the devilish Warden Hobbes (Jim Caviezel) and completely cut off from the outside world. His only option is to befriend the big man on the inside, Emil Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger), whose ties to a shadowy underworld figure might be the ticket to a major payday for Hobbes. Without the large-scale skirmishes of The Expendables or the gore-soaked combat of Rambo to distract moviegoers, Stallone is forced to rely on his charisma, and he proves that he still has plenty to offer. But he takes a backseat to Schwarzenegger here, who delivers his best performance since his return to the big screen. Not only is the Governator given an opportunity to showcase a bit of range, he actually seems to be having fun with this one, which is more than can be said for The Last Stand. Escape Plan is far from a perfect film, but an audience willing to suspend a tremendous amount of disbelief and ignore the gaping plot holes will find an enjoyable flick with a solid blend of action and humor, not to mention a fantastically understated performance by Caviezel, who will hopefully be cast as a major villain in a superhero movies sometime in the very near future.-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com",Escape Plan
184,vadim-berman,For those nostalgic for 1980s,4,17 March 2017,"In a nutshell: great team of A-listers from multiple generations, mildly entertaining, script irritatingly stupid even for a brainless 1980s action movie. The plot is simple: a security expert specializing in breaking from prisons gets double-crossed and plans his escape. I understand that Stallone and Schwarzenegger are at a stage where they view starring in an action movie as a hobby. But many of their co-stars, like Jim Caviezel and Vinnie Jones, are in their prime. It is beyond me why they'd choose to star in this. I disagree with the Razzie award given to Stallone. He was actually pretty good there. Schwarzenegger was a bit more disappointing, especially during the introduction part. Jim Caviezel brought in an evil version of John Reese, and despite the idiotic script, shines as a cold, calculating villain. Vinnie Jones is basically reduced to an extra. He walks around and beats people up, not much else. Every single stereotype is present. A villain with a requisite interest in beautiful stuff like butterflies because that's what all villains do (how do you find a butterfly in the middle of an ocean?). Double-crossed by the boss. A tough guy with a trauma in the past (his family was killed, although here it's a son and not a daughter as usual) - as a part of an idiotic origin story of Ray Breslin: he is a former lawyer/prosecutor, who because a security specialist after the trauma. Finally and most annoyingly, EVERYONE IS A MASTERMIND. Jim Caviezel's villain built his floating prison virtually alone, based on recommendations of another mastermind, Stallone's character. Who, in turn, is working in tandem with Schwarzenegger's character, a financial mastermind pretending to be his subordinate who wanted to ""turn the world financial system into confetti"" by giving the money to the poor (no, I'm not making this up). To make it even more ridiculous, the Schwarzenegger's character has a mole in the CIA, his daughter, who also masterminded hiring Stallone's character to save her father while the CIA was trying to make sure her father stays there (not being able to find out about the relationship of one of their agents and their subject) and offered a lucrative job to the Stallone's boss. Oh, and froze the cheque paid for their services. So on one hand, they were hired to rescue the financial mastermind. On the other hand, to put the security expert in jail. (OK, now I'm curious - who wrote this? Is that a Golan-Globus talent?)Apart from that, it's an entertaining throwback to the 1980s. The finale was especially nostalgic, with big explosions, one-liners, Schwarzenegger shouting orders with his trademark Austrian accent, and a helicopter escape. Unfortunately, as much as I wanted, there was no ""get to the choppah"". I think the old guys still entertain, but really, the script drags everything down.",Escape Plan
185,gevalero,Sam Neil gets to work alongside a couple of dinosaurs (yet again!),5,12 October 2013,"""Escape plan"" is nothing really special. It is basically a 2 hour stretched version of the oil rig platform escape from ""Face-off"", with lots of twists and turns that don't amount to much. This is closer to your typical Stallone low-quality feature than to any to any of the great ones that Arnold came out with during his prime (let's just say it closer to ""The Last Stand"" or ""Cobra"" than to ""The Terminator"" or ""True Lies""). The film is never really very exciting but not for a lack of trying. There's plenty going on but nothing terribly interesting. Better suited for rental than for a trip to the movies.

The plot was really unique and something new for a change and the small twist between Arnold and Stallone at the ending was just hilarious for me Once again Arnold really stole the show for me with some of his best liners and action 'n the movie. Stallone for me on the otherhand tried too hard but couldn't match Arnold's performance but both still managed to do a solid job.

189,tyreeewebster,Retro Reviews- Escape Plan (2013),9,18 October 2013,"After a brief encounter and extended cameo in 'The Expendables 1 & 2', two of the World's greatest (and oldest) action heroes unite for the first time ever, sharing one big, epic movie on the big screen! The film is about Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone), a structural engineer who is wrongly convicted of a crime, and is incarcerated in the World's most secure prison. He teams up with fellow inmate Emil Rottmayer (Arnold Schwarzenegger), and they both hatch a devious plan to escape, whilst trying to avoid the evil Willard Hobbs (Jim Caviezel) Similar to my other reviews, I discuss the story and character performances, let's begin with the latter; our lead actor, Stallone is on auto- mumble in this movie, and plays his character with all the dark menace and boorish mannerisms we've all come to expect from him. The real reason to watch this movie, though, is for the one and only Austrian Oak! Schwarzenegger plays the comedic sidekick in this movie, similar to The Lone Ranger & Tonto. Arnie is clearly having fun in this movie and brings out a lot of really great, hilarious lines (especially one that I would have never expected him to say in a motion picture, ever!) Arnie was so much fun to watch in this movie he was, dare I say it... kind of a decent actor in it. He always kept my interest and portrays his character with all the Macho charisma we all know and love! So, they're out two leads. The Supporting players such as Amy Ryan, Vincent D'Onofrio, Vinnie Jones and 50 Cent give passable performances, none of them give us anything special. Now, let me just state that I really loved this movie. The only thing that ruined it for me was Jim Caviezel's extremely bland performance as the main villain, Hobbs. The most important rule in any cheesy action movie is to have an entertaining, charismatic villain! This didn't, and I really wanted to like this one because the villains are my favourite part of any action movie. Enough of this, let's move onto the story! The story is actually quite well done, it has a simple structure that anybody watching can follow and it has some really tense scenes in there that were absolutely nail- biting! There are even some great twists and turns added in for some extra fun. The film's director, Mikael Hafstrom, who is Swedish- born, really excelled in matching his directing style with the tone of the film, and it felt like a perfect 90's Stallone/Schwarzenegger movie, or what one would have been like back then. So, to him, I congratulate for doing such a great job with the film! Overall, this is a very enjoyable and entertaining action flick! I was never bored, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Stallone & Schwarzenegger, or just action films in general.'ESCAPE PLAN' Directed by: Mikael Hafstrom Produced by: Robbie Brenner, Mark Canton, Randall Emmett, George Furla & Kevin King TempletonWritten by: Miles Chapman & Jason Keller Starring: Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jim Caviezel, Sam Neill, Amy Ryan, Vincent D'Onofrio & Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson",Escape Plan

191,SBenoit5,Overrated,3,1 March 2014,"I hate movies that seem to follow a template. Very predictable, not enough content, cheap wardrobe, even their pairs of glasses where badly chosen that is something that you don't see very often.It was also surprising how the other secondary actors where almost useless in that movie.I mean, it was so predictable that after an hour i could not stand it anymore and i start to fast forward it that is how bad it was.Anyway, if you like movies like The Expendables, or other spaghetti movies you may like that. I love those actors, but not in cheap scenarios like that.The only good thing about this movie in my point of view is that it it fun to see those actors again playing together.",Escape Plan
192,alishahmohd,All hype about Stallone and Arnold being together in the main lead and nothing else.,4,13 May 2014,"Escape Plan was all hype about Arnold and Stallone being in the main lead together and almost nothing else. Besides both men are not in the prime of their careers seeing them together in the lead in the 80s or early 90s would have been something. But this is 2013 and both men are old. Don't get me wrong I like both Arnold and Stallone, Stallone was great in the Rocky films and Rambo and regardless of the hate Arnold gets regarding his acting he has been in some great action flicks like Raw Deal, Terminator 1 and 2, Total Recall among others. So when I saw this film I was expecting an old school action flick with two actors who were the front and center of this movie genre. How wrong was I, what I got was a boring movie with poor action and a ambiguous plot. Only a few action scenes are good honestly, mainly the climax scene, the intro action scene was boring. And is it just me or they use too much Sci-Fi crap to explain what is going on the movie, how far should we suspend our disbelief is beyond me, because this movie expects us to do that a lot.The plot is basically that Stallone is Ray Breslin a man writing books about designing a perfect prison, so someone pays a large sum of cash to have him gone and he ends up in a high tech prison with methods to counteract all his escape plans, there he meets Rottmayer (Arnold) who becomes his friend and together they plan to escape the prison. That's all I can tell without giving away the rest of the plot. But basically their plan involves , starting fights for no reasons at all, getting injured on purpose, getting thrown in the prison's unique hole and then Breslin comes up with a Science Magic plan to bypass security. The plot is extremely boring and all the Sci-Fi that is used in this film to explain all things is just ridiculous and doesn't help matters. While the climax action was good the twists at the end was nothing to write home about. I don't see where this film gets all the praise from apart from a very few decent action sequences, there is almost nothing to write home about. the acting is for the most part NOT GOOD. Stallone needs a translator or subtitles, 90% of the time I can't understand what the hell he is saying, if you had a hard time understanding what the man said in the 80s, you have got another thing coming, plus he is a 60 year old man pretending to play a role of a young man in his prime, It pains me to say this but he was right to be nominated as the Worst Actor for his role in this film, because he was just bad here. Arnold apart from cliché dialogs actually does a decent job, at least you can understand what the man is saying, i was interested in his character and he is playing a more believable role according to his age. The supporting cast was nothing special, it seems like Stallone's boss was afraid of Stallone's assistant and they were trying to create humor over a serious situation. The girl who plays Stallone's love interest, is not only a misfit because she seems to young, she is also tries to be very serious throughout her screen time in the film. The doctor's character was interesting and his backstory about what led to him working in such a brutal prison would have been good to see, but we got none of that.Jimie Caviezel however was actually very convincing in his role as the prison warden and the main antagonist, he was cold, brutal and calculated. Exactly what you need in a villain. Regardless of some silly dialogs and mannerisms, his character actually made a believable villain and he is a strong point of this film believe it or not.I just don't see where all the praise is coming from, boring plot, mostly bad acting, outdated action scenes and too much suspension of reality, really gave me a headache after watching the Escape Plan. This film was mostly all hype about Stallone and Arnold being in the lead together. Good climax action scene, Arnold's decent acting and a believable antagonist are the only saving grace of this film. Overall: 4/10.",Escape Plan
193,kmichaelpm,Hollywood have lost the plot,3,9 January 2014,"It is not often that you get to see a movie that defies description,,,,but I suppose if you wait long enough, anything is possible. Yes, there is lots of action, and yes the acting is fair, but believe me when I say, there is absolutely no sense whatsoever to the plot. You will spend most of your time asking yourself, how did this come about, how did that come about. There is absolutely no continuity in the story and no explanation for half the stuff that happens. So, if you do not need a plot or for it to make sense, and are happy to sit in front of a screen and watch some action and listen to sound effects, without it making any sense,then this is the movie for you. You can give your brain the night off and put your eyes and ears on overtime. I think Stallone and Arnie, can basically write a script during lunch, and just get someone to make the movie regardless. This is nothing but money for the boys. Oh! yeah,,,I gave it a three for the sheer barefaced audacity of making it.",Escape Plan

195,rosanna-83335,A real story with good action,8,14 May 2020,"You would think that a film with two muscle men men like Stallone and Schwarzenegger this would mainly be a film full of good fighting with a basic, simple but ok story. It isn't. It is so much better than that. Yes there are good fight sceans, the people looking for that will not be disappointed but there is some hints of humour and most of all a really good story. There are twists, simple but enough to keep it interesting. The interactions between our two protagonists are subtle and well designed. The rises used to escape and the bits of theory that Ray gives out are really what give the film it's edge.
There is one major problem with his escape theory however, according to him you always need help on the inside and/or outside. Well most people would not have access to the team and equipment he does on the outside so he may be able to escape any prison but a normal prisoner, even if he knew the exact way Ray did it would probably not. As someone who can't stop analysing the coherent/logical a film is, this is a point where I find this film could have found a better way to get him to escape in the first sceans where outside help was not needed so much and communication with them was done in a more prison traditional manner.",Escape Plan
196,aegiswiz-accede,It's not Braveheart,8,4 February 2014,"Escape Plan (2013)I was juggling what to do this evening. I'm in the process of reading several books, and my DVR is full. I have most the 2013 ""hits"" and hit series ready to watch. I run across this ""unknown"" (to me) title and two things draw my attention. Sylvester Stallone & Arnold Schwarzenegger. That settled it for me.I intended to ""look at it"" and decide to watch it or just get it and watch it later as I'm thick in my ""currently reading"" list. Before I know it, I'm 30 minutes into the movie. Yeah, this type movie does that to me. Call it the boom-bang factor or the 'action adventure' addiction. I don't care, I like this stuff. Don't misunderstand, I like Mr. Darcy too. But that's a different kind of ""like"". Why isn't this movie above 6.9? That's what makes this movie a mystery. The movie does EXACTLY what it means to do and it does it well enough that I'm just not up to nit-picking some minor flaw or another. I liked the characters... and HEY, look at the list of actors in this movie. I saw it watching the movie, but after was looking at the list of actors and I was thinking ""Holy cow, why didn't I know about this BIG TIME?"" There just aren't many ""unknown"" artists in this movie.***So here's to spoiling***. It probably won't get any worse than the studio blurb about the movie. Sylvester Stallone plays Ray Breslin who has a job of escaping from high security prisons. Yeah... who wouldn't want THAT job? Anyway, He's very good at it and gets a super ""inescapable"" job. 2 minutes into that ""job"" and he's giving out his ""safety valve/release code"" as he's already figured out, there is no escape. But the code doesn't work... set up anyone? So the plot thickens. He meets Arnold Schwarzenegger's character in prison, ""Rottmayer"". There's a little bit of plot and character development going on but as is usual in movies like this one, they do it with a flare, fights, and whatever it is that made us like Bruce Lee, and Chuck Norris. Kudo's to actors and directors... we rightfully hate the bad guys and love the good guys. Yeah, not so much, huh?I have an ex-friend who swears that no movie under 100 minutes is worth watching. This one exceeds 100 minutes... So you're safe, what could go wrong?

198,omarh92,A very good movie,7,12 October 2013,"*NO SPOILERS*I've always been an Arnold and Stallone fan, growing up to their movies are great. This isn't one of those mindless action films, like 'The Running Man,' or 'Cobra,' this is actually a well thought movie, nothing ingenious but still thought was put into this movie. The story is simple, Stallone breaks out of prisons across the country to test if they are escape proof, then he takes on an assignment on a very tight maximum security prison with Arnold in it, who has a very good character. There is a backbone plot which isn't very special but I guess it fits the movie's style. There is also a small twist which isn't bad, but it is predictable. There are some very good action scenes of course, I mean if you have two of the major movie bada**es in the same movie then you must have some action scenes. Comedy is here and there in the movie too, pretty funny also. There is also Vinnie Jones in the movie, who was good but could use a little more screen time. The movie progresses well, you won't get bored of it, it gets more interesting as the movie goes on, if the movie feels boring later then don't worry a funny scene will wake you up. You might even learn a thing or two in this picture, I did to be honest. Its a great movie, I hope there are more Arnold and Stallone movies like this. This shows that 80s action heroes are not ""dead"" but still awesome, tough, and nostalgic. Enjoy the movie folks.",Escape Plan

Sorry Stallone but I didn't quite understand him when he spoke his lines. He sounded as if he was in a fish bowl under water. The movie is steady paced and it's ""who can you trust"" situation. I did want Hobbes to die slowly after what he did. Then again I didn't want him to die. I wanted him to end up in the inescapable floating prison he re- created (from Bresslin's book) for his crimes etc. And Clark, well he was shipped to an unknown destination. I'm guessing he would die very slowly. Eg starving to death. He WAS the puppet master so karma rears it's head. Enjoyable movie from start to finish. Script not clichéd or cheesy.",Escape Plan

The story is new, with a well executed plot, and excellent direction. The main actors both give the great performances we have come to expect from them, and the supporting cast is quite good as well, with Caviezel and Neill showing their quality as actors. You get plenty of action, without all the cheap thrills so many of the recent ""action"" movies toss in to draw crowds. A real action film doesn't need to depend on such tactics, and draws instead on a solid story, great actors, and good action scenes. There is plenty to keep you on the edge of your seat here.

202,tariq-hossenbux,Characters And Plot Are Poorly Developed,6,18 May 2014,"Normally I am a fan of Stallone's films, but this one left me bored and disappointed. It was too long without a lot of action, had significant plot holes, and cartoonish characters that were really not all that believable. There was a lot of potential for this movie to be relevant being that rendition and secret prisons are a reality in today's world. But this opportunity was completely squandered by Escape Plan. There was really no conversation with the other prisoners about the issue of innocent people being sent to such secret prison facilities. As for plot holes some things just were not that believable. Examples include the way Stallone was allowed to associate with others, not required to wear a tracker or wire in certain situations, and the ease that security systems were disabled. Just too easy to be credible scenes. The main villain's character was not developed at all. There was one scene where he was working on a butterfly display but no other information was given on this. Perhaps they meant to show how meticulous he is? As I stated before there was not enough action to fill up 2 hours of movie. There was a good battle at the very end, but not much in the way of fighting etc for good stretches of the film elsewhere. At the very end some hasty twists and plot revelations were tossed in that explained everything. And it really just felt like they tossed them in. Might as well have just not done it considering the film was a minute or two away from ending. Hopefully someone else will explore this general storyline in another film with better developed and more believable characters later.",Escape Plan
203,rahmannoodles22,Arny & Sly! Escape Plan - Noodles Review,6,19 December 2013,"Rambo & The Terminator together in one movie! How could this go wrong? Well.... in a couple places. Sylvestor Stallone & Arnold Schwarzenneggar (no, I did not have to look his name up to spell it correctly) were THE two biggest action stars in Hollywood, and everyone wanted them to be in a movie together. It would be so awesome and badass! But, that was 20 years ago. However, we get that movie now, when they're both oldies (Expendables doesn't count because that's an ensemble action star movie). In Escape Plan, we have the both of them as the stars of this movie. I've always loved both of these actors (I might be more of an Arnie fan just for his one-liners); they brought us classics like Rocky, Rambo, Predator, Terminator, and many more. However, they've both had their fair share of misfires; and while this isn't exactly one of those, it's also not a modern classic, much less a generic action movie. The story goes that Stallon plays a guy who breaks out of prisons for a living. He literally gets paid to go to prison, then figure out how to break out, so that they can better secure the prisons. However, he gets sent to a really special prison this time, and there's definitely something wrong here... Additionally, I have to talk about this prison a little bit. It's really cartoony and unrealistic. Each prisoner has their own little glass case and the guards all have these black jabbawockeez masks; it's all really unbelievable. It really remind me of the movie Face/Off, which to me is an action classic. But one segment in that movie really threw me off when they were in the top secret, unrealistically secure & high-tech prison. This was like that, except for the whole movie... In this prison, Stallone meets Arnie and they team up to make... an ESCAPE PLAN! I'm not gonna say this movie is bad, because it's definitely not. The acting was fine. You could tell Stallone is getting a bit rusty but he's still a believable actor (still like him better in The Expendables though). Schwarzenneggar, though, was probably the best part of this movie. He had those cheesy one-liners that we've come to expect from him (and I'm almost certain they did that on purpose as an inside joke to Arnie fans & '80s fans). They weren't memorable and they were pretty stupid, but his screen presence was actually gratifying. Also, Jim Caviezel's in this movie as the warden of this intense prison. Jim Caviezel will always be known as the actor who portrayed Jesus, but he's still pretty good in this movie as the asshole warden. He's sort of a comic booky character in that he's a villain who has somewhat weird mannerisms, but that fits, I guess, with this cartoony prison. He may have not died for our sins in this movie, but I still give him credit for standing out as an acceptable bad guy. There's nothing wrong with the directing or technical aspects of the movie. It's all quite mediocre though. The writing could've been better in that the dialogue was rather generic. However, I was fine with all that. The one thing that mainly threw me off, though, was the concept of this super prison that the movie takes place in. It sort of took me out of the movie. In the beginning, the film shows Stallone breaking out of a regular high security prison and that was actually very cool. I was hoping to see more of that, but what can I say? I guess I was disappointed a bit. Nonetheless, Escape Plan is still an entertaining action movie, with its main redeeming quality being the fact that Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenneggar are actually starring in the moviee together. You don't have to rush to the theatre to watch it, but if it ever comes on on TV, it's worth a watch.",Escape Plan
204,dwuksta,"Yes, another prison escape movie, but it was actually enjoyable",7,14 January 2014,"How could a film with both Stallone and Arnie be bad, well it is possible, but not this time. I won't reveal too much because it may ruin the intro to the movie, but suffice to say, Arnie appears a little later in the movie. Stallone's face looks like it's made of silly putty, but Arnie's actually not looking too bad, neither are into the naked topless thing these days, which is understandable considering their age. There is a great balance of humor and intensity in this film, there moments of genuine suspense, and a few surprises. The sets were great, story had original elements to it. Plenty of punch ups, good body count, lots of action, and a few remotely possible gimmicks...possibly a whole mythbusters season worth of investigation in this one movie. Nice to see some direction in the fight scenes without using so many angles and shots, that it's almost dizzy to watch, it was more old skool, much more enjoyable. Ending was slightly confusing for me,few tiny holes I thought, but still worth a strong 7.",Escape Plan

I was expecting another really bad flick with a bad plot and even worse acting, well that assumption was (mostly) wrong.The plot is actually pretty good. I really liked how they introduced new characters. The pace is steady and action scenes are not that long. It never felt boring or idiotic to me which quite a lot of simple action flicks are IMHO. I was also astonished that the story was quite original and that it contained quite a few well done plot twists.Camera work and music score are good but obviously nothing special, the scenery was pretty well thought out. I really enjoyed the cast and their okay acting (you obviously need to take into account that both Sly or Arnold are bad actors) with Jim Caviezel playing an excellent villain. Except for 50 Cent, who should never be cast again!In the end I really enjoyed watching this and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to spend two hours watching a simple action flick.",Escape Plan
206,malaysian1789,I wanted an Escape Plan out of the cinema!!,4,20 October 2013,"A distinct lack of action heroes in 2013 and the public's obsession with recreating nostalgic moments has meant that Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone are very much in demand, 30 years after the peaks of their respective film careers. After the massively adored yet not very good Expendables, the pair return for Escape Plan, which as the title overtly suggests, focuses centrally on an escape plan. Hopefully this is a no-nonsense film that doesn't take itself too seriously or run too long, or I'll probably hatch an escape plan from the cinema....Ray Breslin (Stallone) possibly has the worst job I've ever heard of: he intentionally becomes an inmate at various prisons and duly escapes, revealing the safety flaws each prison has and then selling them security tips to make a profit. In essence, he gets paid to stay in prison for numerous months at a time. Stallone doesn't really have any facial expressions in this film so it's hard to tell whether his character enjoys his life or not, or whether he even knows how to string a coherent sentence together. Anyway, soon enough Breslin is offered 5 MILLION dollars to be sent to a new secret prison and try to escape, but once arriving their he realises it's all a setup and he actually can't get out. Thus, he gains the help of inmate Emilt Rottmayer (Arnie) to try and escape using sheer strength and occasional flickers of intellect. The evil guards patrolling the hi-tech prison are led by former footballer Vinnie Jones, so it clearly won't be hard to escape.This was an average film to put it nicely: it took itself far too seriously, and so the ridiculous plot and acting felt like a drag rather than the ironic parody it should have disguised itself as. Arnie and Stallone have their share of one-liners and gun battles, and even team up with Muslim inmates in the prison, as if to show they are representing a new, inclusive America. Brings a tear to my eye. Not to say it's a horrendous film, some of it was enjoyable, and the story goes along at a nice pace, but it just lacked that bit of you know....logic. Overall, it's not a film you would watch again, or even watch to the end, but if you're a fan of basic action films with no depth I'd probably recommend it.4/10",Escape Plan

That would explain every Bruce Willis movie since ""Die Hard 3"", and this movie. If you've seen the trailer, or read any reviews, you know what's up. Too, you've seen most of the action. Two arthritic, wrinkly beasts try their best to drum up some excitement, but Spielberg has already made ""Jurassic Park"". Pushing 70, what can these two dinosaurs possibly cook up? Stallone stumbles through the entire movie with watery eyes. I'm guessing that his contacts bothered him.No one tried to make this movie as adequate entertainment. Not the director, producer, screen writers, or the actors. Fan boys have given it solid 9s and 10s, even before the movie was released. Their criticism leaves a lot to be desire, as most of their reviews are similar to ""Stallone was a 5, Schwarzenegger was a five - that makes the movie a 10!"" No, it does not. As an aside, I worked as an extra in ""Shanghai"" (directed by Mikael Håfström, the same guy who did this movie). I met him, his father, several producers, the Weinsteins, and the entire crew. In ""Shanghai"", several pieces of plywood were cobbled together as a makeshift ship. The magic of CGI turned the screen image into a believable craft.

208,spradley-3,Not bad - pleasantly surprised,8,8 February 2014,"The last Arnold movie was dreadful - same for Stallone. This one wasn't half bad - pretty well laid out, actually. The plot was complicated but not too much so that you had to rewatch any parts. Arnold is still a pretty stiff actor and his lines are delivered like a 'Terminator' but that's OK. The film is not into character development - this is a pure action movie with likable actors. Jim Caviezel does his typical deadpan but is actually intelligent in some of the scenes. He could have done a better job at developing his character but there wasn't that much to develop in his role, either. Faran Tahir played one of the best roles in the movie. His character felt real and you weren't ever sure which side he was on. There's some good comic relief between Arnold and Sly - it felt honest - and was what carried the film which relies on a partnership between them. I recommend this movie- it's worth the $1.20 rental or streaming fee - the time goes fast and it's not a movie you'll say 'gawd that was awful!'.",Escape Plan

But it is more. Some twists in the movie made it really interesting. Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger have done quite good job: one of the reasons to like this movie. The movie is not too fast paced as their other movies, yet it's not boring. The prison is well designed as escape proof. So, the plan for escape is worth watching. The movie somehow reminds me of ""The Shawshank Redemption"". 'Ray Breslin' to 'Andy Dufresne', 'Emil Rottmayer' to 'Red', and so on.

A perfect movie to say that screenplay is the most important part of a movie.STORY : a very simple story line where a escape artist is framed and thrown into a state of the heart high security prison where escape is only by the means of death. The rest of the story is about how he plans the escape by making another inmate as his friend. Though the story is simple it has ample number of one line humor and twists and turns along with few action sequences that can make the audience ti stay on their seats.PERFORMANCES: though Stallone is the main protagonist in this movie , Arnold gets all the cheers and claps due to his comedy , timely expressions and finally his action sequences. I would say both the characters are played well in their own aspects. There are several other small characters in this movie which there is no need to mention. As a final word the villain is portrayed and played well.TECHNICAL DEPARTMENTS: all the credits to the screenplay as I mentioned earlier.

212,brickmoviereviews,Escape Plan: Prison Gets Tougher with Stallone and Schwarzenegger,8,20 October 2013,"What happens when a professional prison-escaper can't escape from prison? Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) is forced to answer this question when he is trapped in the world's most secret and secure prison, where the CIA sends super bad criminals to ""disappear."" Basically being an escape artist, Breslin is the world's go-to guy when it comes to designing prisons. He wrote the book on how to design the perfect, escape proof prison, and is even hired to go into supermax prisons and attempt to escape, to help secure flaws. When the CIA contacts Breslin and partner Lester Clark's (Vincent D'Onofrio) security firm to hire his services, Breslin reluctantly accepts, knowing working for the CIA would mean turning his back on all the safety protocols he created to get out of prison.Things go smoothly, until the day Breslin is scheduled to be picked up by the CIA, when he is roughly kidnapped, the tracking device dug out from his forearm, subdued, and taken to the most secure prison ever built. Expecting Warden Marsh to be there, Breslin is surprised when he meets Warden Hobbes (Jim Caviezel) at the prison, who has no idea Breslin is there to attempt an escape, or so we think. Realizing something about the job is amiss, Breslin is befriended by one of the tougher guys in the prison, Emil Rottmayer (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Breslin loses all hope of escaping when he realizes the prison is a massive ship in the middle of the ocean, until a push from Rottmayer motivates Breslin to break himself and his new best friend out.Believe it or not, Escape Plan isn't your typical Sylvester Stallone action movie. There is plenty of action, of course, however there is a decent amount of methodical thinking and strategizing as the two plan their escape. This is one of Stallone's better performances is recent memory, and Schwarzenegger's performance certainly stands out above a few of his more recent roles. Jim Caviezel's Warden Hobbes is not unlike his character on Person of Interest, aside from being on different sides of the law, he plays a calm, collected villain who always seems to be one step ahead for a good portion of the movie. Caviezel's performance is solid and his character was well written.Staying in-tune with past performances, Stallone and Schwarzenegger provide the same level of badass we have come to expect from them. Stallone's familiar character traits begin to really appear about halfway through the film, while the classic Schwarzenegger action comes to fruition in the climactic final scenes on the deck of the ship. One criticism would be the question posed to Stallone's Breslin ""what kind of man decides to spend his life in prison?"" is never fully answered. We get some insight once Breslin reveals who he is to Rottmayer, but we never get the full explanation.Going into this weekend, I planned on reviewing two movies: The Fifth Estate, and Escape Plan. Based on the trailers I had seen and small synopses I had read, I expected The Fifth Estate to be a home run, and Escape Plan to be a dud. After seeing what turned out to be a dud in The Fifth Estate, I was unsure about seeing Escape Plan. I would have waited for box office numbers to help my decision, however everything this weekend would have lower numbers with Gravity still dominating. I'm happy to say that Escape Plan is filled with action and excitement, and definitely worth seeing.Rating: 8 of 10 Check out more of our reviews at brickmoviereviews.wordpress.com !",Escape Plan
213,chumpsteak,Good old fashioned action.,8,5 November 2013,"Didn't know much about Escape Plan & went to see it purely because it's Arnie & Sly. This movie really delivered the goods for me. I expected a tongue in cheek OTT Expendables sort of film but its more of an old school action drama thriller really. The story's actually something new & the idea of Stallone being a professional prison break tester is really refreshing. Characters are nicely thought out & all performances are good with Vinnie Jones, Faran Tahir, Amy Ryan, Vincent D'Onofrio, Sam Neil & even 50 Cent playing their bit parts well. The bad guys are really nasty & the good guys are righteous but there are enough little twists to keep things interesting. I especially liked the way the film mostly avoids CGI in favour of fisticuffs & proper gunfights. Plus most of the stunts are performed by the actors themselves. Most modern action movies are just a series of set pieces strung together by a flimsy plot but Escape Plan is driven by the story & as such it gradually builds to the satisfying finale. Of course there are little plot holes & unrealistic moments but that's all par for the course with this sort of movie, so be prepared to suspend your disbelief from time to time.",Escape Plan
214,btnthx,Escape this movie,3,17 October 2013,"I sometimes sit with my friends and we talk about the worst job to have. Fast food worker, test subject, maybe that guy who cleans the monkey cages at the zoo. What if your job though was to go to prison? You would have to serve just like every other inmate, but you also have to find a way to break out of the prison you are in. So basically your job is to break out of prisons. It all sounds fun until that day you can't break out, what happens then?""Escape Plan"" is a movie about guy who makes a living out of breaking out of prisons, just in case the title didn't give that away already. That guy's name is Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) and there is not a prison that can hold him. Ray works for the federal prison system to test their maximum control prisons on how escapable they are. Well apparently Ray always gets out, so I would say those prisons are pretty easy to escape from. Well when you are this good, someone is bound to offer you a shot at a prison that someone believes you can't get out of. Ray takes that job, and it sent to a prison unlike any he has seen before. The place is designed by someone who read the book on ways to make your prison escape proof, a book which Breslin wrote. It doesn't take Breslin long to realize that someone wants him to disappear forever, and that this job may be a little harder than planned. Breslin though meets ""the man who can get things"" in Rottermayer (Arnold Schwarzenegger), who wants to know who this new prisoner is. Breslin soon lets Rottermayer in on the truth and together they come up with the perfect escape plan.Now I will hand it to them, the escape plan they come up with is pretty good, now if only the movie was that good. Twenty five years ago this would have been the biggest movie in the world. Stallone and Schwarzenegger would be in big bold letters and every red blooded male would be in line waiting. The problem is this is 2013 and not 1991, but just like this movies formula, the story is behind the times. Watching Arnold and Sly in their primes was fun; I mean you really believed that they could both single handily taken out an army. Now when I see Arnold pick up a M60 and start firing it, I am more worried he might pull something in their prime, Arnold and Sly would pull down twenty million per film, now like all the other aging action stars of the eighties and nineties the only reason they have jobs is because of each other. ""Escape Plan"" just came out in the wrong decade, written by Miles Chapman and Jason Keller, you get the feeling they watched way to much eighties action movies. Which could have its place in the current state of film, but not here. When I was younger I used to dream about Arnold and Sly teaming up for a movie, well after watching this movie the only escape I was looking for, was the fire exit.Brian Taylor http://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/",Escape Plan
215,California_Girl_2058,Love ALL Men Movies,10,14 June 2014,"I like Arnold and Sly so I am writing a review to show my support. I love all men movies: No Escape, All is Lost, and movies that are almost all men movies (like this one). My favorite parts were Arnold's funny lines. Arnold and Sly's fight in the prison. I generally love men's prison movies (for instance; the remake the longest yard). My favorite part was Sly's intelligence of knowing how to break out of prisons. I liked Sly in ""The Expendables"" with the fight he had with Jean- Claude Van Damme (people said it wasn't long enough). I wish these Actors could make more PG-13 so the kids could go see them without their parents since a lot of them have to sneak in the movies to rated ""R"" movies (I don't approve of it) but just saying that kids 12-16 years old are the general audiences at the theaters. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.",Escape Plan

Cue bromances, prison riots and sadistic guards.Think of all the prisoner films with the tough guy unjustly imprisoned. Think of any original take on the genre then throw those those thoughts away.Formulaic thriller. All the good guys are good, all the bad guys bad, 'twists' well telegraphed and of course there's always time for a bon mot when killing a baddie.

217,Sophoclaw,Quintessential and entertaining action movie.,9,4 January 2018,"At last these two titans of the action film gender meet in a most entertaining movie. Rambo meets Terminator! And if you are keen to action films this will not disappoint you because it's charged with action practically from the first scene. With a quite complex plot in its structure, this movie takes you to an environment where our heroes require sharp thinking, quick, elaborated and many times courageous moves with the strategy of a master chess player in thinking and the skills of a samurai on the plentiful action scenes. I was delighted with the structure of the story where many diverse and apparently unknown elements come together to make the intricate plot so that both Sylvester and Arnold can develop their precious capacity in to the full and entertain us with what they can do best without an empty or boring moment. As extra positive bonus we have the likes of Jim Caviezel who delivers an astounding performance as the main villain of the film impersonated as a cold, calculating, cynical and bloody serious prison director and last but not least Sam Neill as the subdued prison doctor. We also enjoy the excellent performances of Vincent D'Onofrio as a treacherous and misleading agent, Faran Tahir as the religious prisoner and Amy Ryan as Stallone's sexy companion and colleague. This is top entertainment and you will be happy that your money was invested in seeing and enjoying this film.",Escape Plan
218,bobbystryker,Need to get away from things for a while?? Then you need an Escape Plan!!! Read on for more!,8,10 November 2013,"What a cracking little movie this is. A nice twisty action thriller from start to finish. With shades of Tango & Cash as well as Face / Off you can't really go wrong. To be honest, I'm surprised we're not getting loads more of these movies collaborating our favourite action heroes of yesteryear. How hard could it be to come up with a story around these guys? I've always wanted to see a reboot of Jackie Chan's Dragons Forever – replacing Jackie, Sammo & Yuen with Stallone, Schwarzenegger and Van Damme! That would be awesome!Anyhow, lets get back on track. Stallone plays Ray Breslin, an expert at breaking out of prisons; he's hired to test the security of so-called maximum-security institutions. After a small demo of his skills, we jump into the main meat of this movie.Offered twice his normal fee to test out a new super prison, touted as the perfect prison, he finds the opportunity hard to resist, despite concerns from his team. The plan is simple. He goes in, breaks out, only him and his team know his real identity as well as the warden of the prison and if the heat gets too strong he has an evacuation code which he can give the warden at any time to forfeit the mission and be released. The only catch being that, unlike previous missions, this time even his team can't be told the whereabouts of the top secret detention facility. What could possibly go wrong? Everything!!As soon as he's on the inside, it becomes pretty clear that the whole thing was a set up. The warden he was expecting is not there, he has no idea where he is, his team has no idea where he is. The only thing that is clear is that he's intended to die in there. Unlike any other prison he's ever been in, this place is a modern high tech super fortress run by mostly faceless masked guards, with the only exceptions being hard ass guard Drake (Vinnie Jones) and head honcho Warden Hobbes (Jim Caviezel). Stallone is forced to forgo his usual methods, to think out of the box, to try and break out from the unbreakable. Thankfully, he forms an alliance with one of the other prisoners, a very worn and weathered Schwarzenegger. But can they both make the break? Will one of them die? Will their escape plan be foiled?? You'll have to see for yourselves.I enjoyed seeing Arnie back in the fray with an actual character and some acting to do. He was very rusty in both Expendables as well as The Last Stand, so it really was cool to see Arnie back to form, doing some things that even Arnie fans are likely to have not seen before. I also liked the fact that this isn't a straight up action movie. If that's what you expect then you may actually be left disappointed. There's a hell of a lot of logic, brainpower and planning that has to go into trying to break out of the perfect prison and it's really engaging to watch how Stallone and Arnie try to figure out their escape plan. A great balance of brain and brawn, the characters help to sell the story and pull you in, making you wonder if you would ever be able to escape if that was you in there.What didn't I like about this movie? 50 Cent. He wasn't terrible but he just seemed kind of awkward and mostly unbelievable in most of his scenes. Thankfully, his scenes were few and far between. The only real thing I would mention is that you do need to pay attention to keep track of who's who initially, but as the plot really gets rolling, that's very much a non-issue.This was a surprise gem of a movie for me. It's not a huge blockbuster, it's not a CGI extravaganza, it's just a solid action thriller sold on a really cool premise featuring some really cool characters.Catch it on the big screen while you can.Rating 8 out of 10.FOR THIS AND OTHER REVIEWS CHECK OUT MAXIMUMEXTREME.NET",Escape Plan
219,Micheal_Williams,"""you hit like a vegetarian...""",3,18 January 2014,"They (Stallone and Arnie) really should have made this in the 80's it would have been so kick-ass but, I guess this will have to do.For me I thought the movie was going down the wrong street from the start, I hate digital films- what I mean is you watch a digital film (sin city, Evil Dead) and then watch a Film FIlM (Taxi Driver, Dark Knight) you can textures and lights and colours you would get with a HD digital camera making the movie look fantastic, plus it makes the crew have to worker harder which always results in the film being better.If Stallone and Arnie weren't in this I would have never finished it, and it definitely watchable and is pretty good but you know me I fussy with the visuals of a film.3 STAR= really bad + Stallone + Arnie = 5 STAR= alright",Escape Plan

The entire production of this movie seemed like it was made by 10 year olds with a lot of money.Where do I begin? I don't even know.OK, so we all know that Sly and Arnie are not exactly Oscar material in terms of acting, but seriously. Some scenes in this movie made me feel embarrassed. Script and dialog - whoever wrote the dialog for this movie should go to a writing school...I have rarely encountered anything so hopelessly dumb. Direction - the whole movie feels like one elongated movie scene. Action - OK...not more than that. I usually like movies about prisons and escapes so I had hopes to be entertained at the very least. I really don't understand why these two geriatric action heroes need to make movies... It is painful to watch. Just retire already! You have hundreds of millions of dollars!

224,WinstonNoCGI,Thrilling action movie with standard plot - and utterly bad CGI,8,1 July 2018,"Watching the movie remembered me of the old Lock Up flick. The story appears to be rather similar to me.It has its thrilling moments, yet I was missing suspense.Acting, soundtrack, camera, lightening, they were all very well performed.One thing that really pissed me off was the utterly bad CGI: parts of jail interior, helicopter, ship, escaping sequence, blood squibs, even characters ... it all was so painfully poorly shaded and animated, so unreal ... I could barely watch those sequences.In one sequence (don't want to spoil here), Stallone seems to be a springily superball, not a human being. In the animation sequence, he just resembles one of those repulsive Marvel hero animations, having their character animated like being just an implausible whippy superball.I don't understand why didn't they use real props for the flick, like they did back in the 80s? It's all there! And I doubt it's more expensive than the CGI part. But it would have given far better results. ... Well, on the other hand, given the quality of the CGI, I suspect the CGI must have been a real bargain.",Escape Plan

227,atkinson-30537,Good watch but not the best,7,22 June 2019,Just recently watched this and it has a good plot and great actors. When it starts off when he is in the prison and escapes you just think it's another prison break movie type but as it goes on you realise it's slightly different. The acting thought out was decent but I feel that friendships and the movie once they are in the new max prison is rushed though a bit and could easily could have made 2 movies out of it and explained and expanded on things a bit more as you wouldn't really tell someone you have only just met a few days later that your trying an escape and who you really are. Some bits are unbelievable as well like the usual people can shoot other people with one bullet bit when it comes to the main cast cant shoot a barn door. And when hes down first looking at the tunnels and blocks the camera it seems like he has all the time in the world and it's not till the water comes in that they actually check on him. I mean overall I'd say it was worth a watch even though I feel it could of been done slightly better!,Escape Plan

I guess I just expected more.Seeing the trailers and all you expect to see a sophisticated, clever movie about a breakout expert that has to breakout from the ultimate prison. But what you get is more of a normal cheap action film with a gimmick.. The beginning is nice, the way they don't explain how he breaks out of that 1st prison only to explain it later. But then the 'Big Breakout' is just not all that clever, or well planned.. its basically just a normal action film sequence that involves the main characters becoming bullet proof and explosions, running around etc While dumb action films are fun sometimes ...

229,snmeesala101,Braniacs with Brains and Muscles,8,4 March 2015,"Escape Plan is such an fantastic movie, I don't know where to begin! The movie is well written and cleverly devised. The characters have you in the palm of their hands. You don't know what is going on just as much as the characters. The best part is that you still feel like an action hero as the protagonist tries to create a plan to escape the crazy prison. There is never a dull moment. My only critique is that the movie, at first, tries to ram in the fact that the main character is a genius too many times. We get it! However, his brilliance never ceases to fail. Escape Plan is a good weekend night movie for those who are itching for a kick ass plot. I mean, to of the biggest legend in action cinema are in this movie. How can you go wrong?",Escape Plan
230,tdevereaux,"Not great, but entertaining.",7,28 October 2013,"Let's face it, Escape Plan has more holes in it's plot then Paris Hilton has in her cherry. And the acting isn't great either, with 50 Cent being completely wooden. But, come on. Do we really expect an acting extravaganza from a Sly/Arnold movie? It is interesting enough to forgive most of the plot holes, and the action takes care of the rest. Sadly though, it's the climax of the movie that was kind of flat. Not terrible, just not as exciting as it could have been.One more thing, I think this movie would have been better off without Arnold or Stallone. It's not that they were bad, it's that people generally associate them with over the top cheesy movies these days. Caviezel was fantastic as the bad guy and with two different actors as the heroes, it could have been really great. However, I was entertained and had a good time.",Escape Plan
231,chrysoberylz,The 80's Heroes Epic Escape,8,19 October 2013,"Bring the good old days back! Everyone agrees that Stallone and Schwarzenegger are the top kick-ass icon during 80's. They may age and become slower than their younger selves but they still kick-ass.Well, I missed the first minutes of the movie. Yeah, I was embarrassingly late :( I came in the cinema when the title ""Escape Plan"" came up on the screen. So what is it? Five minutes late, maybe? But with the flashback, I know what happened in the part I missed. Stallone's character, Ray Breslin is a Houdini, but in this case, he is talented in finding his way out of prison. No, he is not a criminal. Just to test the prison's quality in the security aspect.Then the plot moved to a lawyer from CIA (Yeah, Langley..) who asked Breslin to test a prison prototype's security. He agreed and nothing is wrong until Breslin realized that his evacuation code did not make any sense. Like he is being put into prison for real. Then as usual, prison fight, a stranger, Emil Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger) suddenly became a best friend, then planning to escape from that prison. And, of course, they finally escaped from that prison.The theme is not new. We all know there are lots of movies and TV series like this, like Prison Break and Escape from Alcatraz. But this movie is executed perfectly and I really enjoy this movie. A bit boring the first twenty minutes but the rest of the movie did entertain me.Action is a must. Blood, fight, guns, and most;y anything available in nearest location. And some gags, humors, everything hilarious add more excitement to this movie. The detail of the prison is amazing. This movie is like a ""Escaping Prison 101"". Using available stuff and human resources to escape from a prison.This movie is highly recommended. Stallone and Schwarzenegger still kick-ass and also can be funny at the same time. I am sure you will not be disappointed.",Escape Plan

Stallone is a jail break artist who breaks out of prisons for his paycheck. He shows prison systems their flaws so that they can make it better. He gets can job to break out of a high security prison for the baddest of bad ass people who people just wanna see disappear. A prison so secret even its location is not disclosed to him, and as all heroes are Stallone agrees (We would not have movies if these have some sense).

The prison is innovative, interesting and features many interesting mysterious ideas, that we as a viewer get to see along the film goes on.The story is about a prison escpae specialist, Breslin (Sylvester Stallone), who gets captured in a high-tech prison, which he tries to break out with his inmate (Arnold Schwarzenegger).While also being a rough action movie, the film offers many mysteries and enough thrills for a prison escape film to be interesting enough. Also I thought the plot is kind of smart, because prison escape movies always need time to be written. While you could scribble a bad storyline the writers created a new path, although the second installment of this film completely messed up my hopes for this franchise.I wouldn't say that ""Escape Plan"" is the best prison escape film there is, but I would say that it belongs to the better ones, along with ""The Shawshank Redemption"", although that one is way more deep and thought than ""Escape Plan"".",Escape Plan

May be not; may be yes; still not convinced, though I just finished viewing it five minutes ago.That being said, I will say that is a an unexpectedly refreshing offering from Stallone/Schwazenegger.Though there is much at which to yawn, there is much that surprises; and were it not for losing my IMDb rating privileges I'd share some refreshing surprises; not the least of which is the ending. Or should I say endings, because it is a multifaceted one.The acting is, well, Stallone/Schwarzenegger; the premise Stallone/Schwarzenegger, but the telling isn't as completely trite as one would expect. I read the IMDb rating first and sneered at a 7 rating; but I can see where many viewers, especially fans would go that far.Me? What the hey, I'll give it a 7 also: It was very entertaining.J R",Escape Plan

This is the GREAT COME BACK. I was expecting to watch one movie just like all others. In fact we bought the tickets because there were no tickets for Gravity. Now I am thinking to go watch it again. I wont pretend that some things are not predictable, but the movie is extremely entertaining and away from stereotypes. The Scenario is complex and both actors share the same time on the screen. Even the acting is good - and when I say that you know that you are not going to watch Shakespeare. No cameos this time, we have two protagonists here. There are a few references to what they have done in the past, references that you expect to see and although the movie keeps you tensed there are nice jokes too.I can compare this movie to True Lies, or even the Terminator and Rambo series.",Escape Plan
248,ayyubhebat,nice to watch,8,5 July 2014,"I never watch this movie trailer on you tube or any else, but I knew this movie was played by S.Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger(sorry if mistaken). I was interested to see this two Star were together to play in this movie. I don't even know how was the storyline, so I just watched the movie then I got the objective in the middle of story. Ray Breslin(S.Stallone) is the world's foremost authority on structural security. He used to analyze every high security prison and test the endurance of each prisons which is he needs to escape from the prison. The storyline was moving well and the secret was kept properly. The acting was good for me , not too amazing and the action was good enough , simple , not too excessive and I like it. So, just this review from me for this movie. It's a nice movie to watch, still fresh for a mystery film.",Escape Plan
249,octored,Nope,2,25 July 2021,Haha what a deluxe prison. Most private prisons in the USA are a inhuman disgrace; too small for a man to stand or move. The black holes are sheer horror with no windows. In what reality are they living in. I understand it's supposed to be an action / escape type of movie but come in Sly you had an opportunity to educate and possibly have an impact. Escape from Alcatraz is a fine example of such a movie. Schwarzenegger Is actually pretty good. Watch it for him.,Escape Plan

251,zysis,Finally?,4,27 January 2014,"Sly and Arnie finally together in a film! It's not the typical action movie to begin with, which sees Sly playing what appears to be a ""Bruce Willis"" role. This kind of character doesn't gel well for Sly in my eyes. The film isn't really what I'd hoped for over the many years of really enjoying what both Arnold and Sly have done for action films, yet is refreshing to see both of them finally hit the screen together. Sam Neil was a surprising addition and lent some credibility to the cast, yet in all, I would expect that such greats would consider getting a great writer also. The plot is flimsy from a practical standpoint, leaving the trained viewer to hold the entire story in disregard. Yes, it could be written better, I could imagine both greats being put in far more delicate situations, but being what it is, it's a film worth watching, even to see the men work together for once.My suggestion is this: if you have these actors, get the old directors and writers! Old fans wind up not only following actors, but writers and directors also. An enjoyable film on screen, but not what I'd expect of Arnold or Sly, especially in a ""fight the system"" film with a seemingly high budget. I'd certainly pay to see them again, and I'm sure they know this. I'd LOVE to see greats like Ridley Scott and Harlan Ellison involved, which would make a film even more epic than simply going to see the action greats as we know them. This is by no means a swansong for both actors, I'd love to see more of them together with some big names from all sides of action film, not just acting! This is by no means a memorable film for either action hero, and hopefully isn't the end of a collaboration that made me smile like a little boy watching Conan or Rocky the first time.If any two people were to be chosen for immortality, Arnold and Sylvester would certainly be on my list! Furthermore, a film where they act their age would not be dismissed, and would certainly make for a refreshing and wonderful story. We all know they are not your average sixty something actors, and would be well cast in a film exemplifying this fact. In all, a strong performance from all parties, and well worth seeing, even if only to see them together on screen.",Escape Plan

The action from Sylvester and Arnold is exactly what you would expect. For that matter everything about this movie is exactly what you would expect My only problem ish is the choice of Vincent D'Onofrio because form the point of as soon as he walked on screen I knew he was going to be a bad guy, and I would have like at least one surprise in the movie. But if you are looking for an OK action movie that you don't have to pay to much attention to while watching this is a good movie for that.",Escape Plan
253,NestorNestor,You hit like a vegetarian,5,9 January 2017,"Although action film aficionados have waited decades to see Schwarzenegger/Stallone team-up, and when it finally arrived (at least 20 years past both of the action giants' prime) it was rather dull. The age of both stars is not the reason at all, why the film falls flat, rather the fault lies in generic and trivial script and unimaginative direction by Mikael Håfström. Both stars were nearly 70 when they shot the film, but their charisma and ability to raise some hell is 100% there. It is unfortunate that after all these years waiting to see these two pair up, and we get served half baked product. Besides seeing Sly and Arnold share screen together 'Escape Plan' has very few to offer - there are some B-movie worthy thrills, quite well disguised plot twists (considering the whole quality of the script), not enough memorable one-liners or witty exchanges between the two greats. The material definitely should have been better for these two charismatic action idols. And supporting cast, though not bad, is exactly what you expect when you see these actors in this kind of movies - Jim Caviezel as sinister, intelligent villain, Sam Niell as smart and sympathetic character, Vinnie Jones as raging sadistic lunatic, Amy Ryan as some woman, and finally 50 Cent as can't act.Conclusively I can say that 'Escape Plan' hits the taste buds of '80s action fans like a vegetarian.

A fascinating idea that could have led to a better movie than this.After being locked into a futuristic prison Breslin befriends Arnold Schwarzenegger's character- whose name is something like Rottweiler- to escape.There is a really boring mid section of the film where Stallone and Arnie talk incessantly trying to sound intelligent. Stallone pulls some Macgyver type tricks etc , you know the score.the final action scene is quite good, but it fails to take into account that no amount of facelifts and toupees can disguise the fact that Stallone and Arnie are old men. Their machine gun toting days should be behind them.On the plus side Jim Cavezeal is very good as the prison governor. Sad to see Sam Neill- a fine actor- wasted in a thankless role.",Escape Plan

After Dark knight I would say this is one movie to watch out for this year, where you actually use your brain to understand the fast paced story. You will never feel bored or left out in this movie.

Gunshots, cars crashes, fights and lots of adrenaline running through your veins, right? Totally true!!! However, this film shows more than just action, action and action. Escape Plan tells a story of Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone), a structural-security authority that is sent to a prison where nobody has escaped. He needs to put all his knowledge in practice to survive and get out alive. Many awkward situations take place to force Ray improve his methods. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays one of the prisoners that starts a friendship with Stallone's character. Jim Caviezel plays Hobbes, the head of the prison. The prison is THE big character of the film, it is secret and its location is unknown. If you were a prisoner there, you would know how a bee's life is. Although I like Schwarzenegger's movies, I am not fan of Stallone's. Even though, I was convinced that it would be a great idea to see them acting the action. 'Let's go to Action Time' - That was what I thought. What a huge surprise I had when I realized that Escape Plan blew my mind! The climax is perfectly created; the crew is the best choices for the plot (it couldn't be anybody else). Stallone did really good job and Schwarzenegger was funny, hilarious sometimes. But I would like to expose my unexpected feeling when I saw Jim Cavievel's performance. Just a simple word to say: P-E-R-F-E-C-T-I-O-N! He is amazing, magnificent. It is absolutely fantastic how he becomes one of the main characters so easy and in a quiet way. The final words of this review are: Be afraid of action movies, you can shift into a fan of them.

264,mrjessjess,emotionally locked up,6,31 October 2013,"Hold your horses, before you go judging a movie based on its poster, trailer, or stars of the show, take a step back, because it's probably not what you'd expect. Now, what do I mean by that? Well it's not your typical action movie, with running, gunning and tough guy saves hot girl while beating up the bad guys. No. It's also not a crime drama full of murder and mystery. Again, it's not a psychological thriller that keeps you guessing at motives and personality disorders. Nope, try again. Furthermore it's not a paranoia flick that teases your fear of claustrophobia, solitary confinement, or people out to get you. Unfortunately it's none of those things. So what exactly is it? It's a strange mesh of ""smart guy gets himself in over his head and makes an unlikely friend"" and ""a sporting egotistical game of cat and mouse.""The movie doesn't take a straightforward approach to action like the majority of Stallone or Arnold films, instead it skirts into a subtle or nuanced sub category. Unfortunately I don't think that helped the film, but rather confuses or disappoints the audience. Granted most ticket buyers would prefer to see Arnold and Sly kicking ass on a battlefield or going head to head but what they get instead is a movie starring Stallone that happens to have Arnold thrown in and the 2 of them awkwardly and too conveniently hook up, becoming BFF's on the spot. I have to admit how surreal it is seeing them on screen together after so many years of rivalry at the box office. It is a novelty that this film exploits but not quite in the way you were hoping. Instead Arnold and Stallone turn things into a weird buddy comedy, with Arnold being uncharacteristically funny and Stallone playing the usual tough and serious type. Arnold definitely takes a back seat to Stallone as a mastermind. So for all you old school Schwarzenegger fans, you might be a little put off to see the Terminator playing second fiddle to Rambo. Other than that, the movie is rough and tumble. Lots of testosterone and just pushing yourself to the limit. You can tell it's about going beyond your breaking point and finding the strength to overcome oppression. The movie felt polarizing. There just wasn't enough time or reason to care about the protagonist, give the vague back story and rare moment of emotion from him. It felt a lot of times like he could care less how things went.There just wasn't much humanity in this film. However there was good action and drama, just not enough to be this movie's saving grace. The worst part about this was the non impactful ending.There was no light at the end of the dark tunnel, no life altering revelation or change of heart, just right back to the daily grind for our main character. I wanted to like this film a lot more than I did. Still it had its fun moments, small twists and excitement.",Escape Plan

Haven't you noticed the lack of topless scenes in this all-out action film? It pulled off plenty of fight sequences and none shirts.I don't remember seeing any whatsoever, do me the courtesy of enlightening me about any I missed. Hopefully I can get a load of their abs, or much more likely doughnuts.There are two major plot twists, quite exciting indeed and I don't want to spoil either, because that's as much surprise as the whole film has in store for you, unless you are a fan of insipid old school hammy acting and hokey gunfights.I did enjoy the flick except for the hasty ending where they stopped executing their plans and started acting out bullet-proof superpower.

This is a great movie about escaping prisons and it is oh-so-clever! From very early one you side with the protagonist and start to feel what he is feeling at all times (mentality wise not physically wise). It is great because it makes us more involved with the movie. The movie is quite up-beat and doesn't beat around the bush. It's not your traditional prison-escape movie, it goes much deeper than that. Overall, I feel like there is a lesson to be learned from this movie and that we should all think of it. There is also quite a lot of comedy in this movie and it is spread out and applied where necessary. I think this is a great suspenseful and funny movie, that is definitely a must- see!",Escape Plan

I'm so glad I watched it!Thie action scenes are great, typical Stallone and Arnie (usual massive gun scene!) but what was most pleasing was the story behind the movie. The story is somewhat believable and keeps you engaged the whole time. You are never really sure what will happen next although I did think the ending was guessable.I would also like to point out the acting in this movie. Stallone sometimes gets negative reviews about his acting but he was great in this movie. In fact, all the actors were. Solid performances with a mixture of action and humour makes this a very enjoyable movie and well worth watching.I think many people will be surprised by this movie, especially when they look at the cast.Stallone's best film in years.

There was some jokes here and there made you laugh. I felt story line and acting was pretty good, maybe great at times, that is apart from having to look at that freeze face.

270,iain-stleon,Action Packed Thriller,9,24 August 2014,"The Action Genre of the 1980's is back and this is an enticing and thrilling movie. In the first pairing of Slyvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger in leading roles, this is wow from beginning to end.The character portrayed by Stallone and Schwarzenegger work together to escape from a floating prison designed to keep undesirables from seeing the light of day again. Stallone's character who is an expert in prison design and then exposing the weaknesses of the prison is asked to enter a maximum security facility in order to point out any flaws that may exist, he has no knowledge of the facility and accepts the assignment with some reluctance.Inside the prison Ray Breslin (Stallone) meets Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger) and together they work together to find a way out of what appears to be an inescapable fortress. The prison is run by a sadistic warden, who is aware of Breslin (Stallone) and what he does for a living. The warden uses the books written by Stallone's character to ensure that the prison is a fortress.Breslin (Stallone) uses the torture boxes to find his way out and discovers that the facility is on an ex oil tanker, using his wits and the help of Rottmayer (Schwarnegger) he is able to determine the position of the ship. Along with other prisoners they find a couple of weaknesses, but the warden is watching and discovers that they are trying to escape.When the warden attempts to break Breslin's will, you do feel that all may be lost until he is given a pep talk from his new friend Rottmayer and again they work together to breakout of the floating fortress. Using the ship's doctor they get a message to Rottmayer's people and then the breakout begin, with some misdirection.When the time comes they break free and with some excellent 80's action scenes the movie begins to pump and tho you have been barracking from the start for them to escape, you are now enthralled to see if the plan is successful. Which they are and when they are on land again, you find out Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger) is actually not who you thought and that Breslin (Stallone) was put in the prison by his business partner played by Vincent D'Onofrio.This is not a sophisticated as you would expect, but it does highlight that even aging action stars who just a few years ago were irrelevant are able to roar back into starring roles.If you like true action movies and heroes you will enjoy this movie. I rate this movie highly as it brings back memories of all the action movies from the 1980's and early 1990's. I rate this movie 9/10.",Escape Plan
271,jongleur,Good popcorn movie,8,22 October 2013,"I went into the theater expecting pretty much what I got. Two hours of watching Stallone and Schwarzenegger gently sparring with each other while attempting to break out of a supposedly unbreakable prison, with some nefarious types responsible for them being there. Both of them have secrets, and they only slowly reveal their secrets to each other, while both are attempting to just stay alive as well as seeking a way to escape. The rest of the prisoners get short-shrift for the most part, they are generally only caricatures with no real attempt to provide any character development. The acting is okay, pleasant seeing John Caviezel in another role, in some ways similar to his current persona on Person of Interest. I will almost certainly watch this film again when it get out on DVD or shows on television. And will almost certainly have a bowl of popcorn in my lap when I do.",Escape Plan
272,shie_aw,Great Movie,8,9 July 2019,"In the first part of this film, the hero who is in prison does something strange, and I had no idea what it means. After he manages to break out of prison, I realized those acts are all for the prison break and believed that he must be a professional criminal. However, in reality, he is not a criminal, but a security consultant who goes into prison and breaks it to prove that the security system has some problems. Unexpected! It is the nice setting. In this film, there are some surprising truths. Every single act has a meaning which is later revealed. It made me so excited that I never felt bored, but eager to watch the next scene.
However, this film has one problem. The main characters are too strong. Their plan goes well with several difficulties. They shoot guards with guns and kill them all so easily, or maybe the guards are too weak. They no longer seems to have an enemy. I wanted to see them struggle to break out of prison.

The plot is ridiculous. I also thought the jokes were lame and sometimes even out of place. (I'll admit: I had to laugh once.)It's like the director didn't know which way to go: serious, exiting, or funny? If the movie hadn't taken itself so seriously (like Red, for example) it would have been much better. I also think Sylverster Stallone is getting too old for this kind of movies.

Here we have action movie with a very different angle, the story moves brilliantly and all the artist have done full justice with their roles, it is a kind of roller coaster ride, there is high voltage drama which builds up gradually, technically also the movie is solid.

275,donteatcarbs,Uninventive with strong hints of political preaching (MINOR SPOILER),2,27 October 2013,"Do we really need to see another movie in which Stallone plays the victim vs some big bad brutal machine? And in which the warden is a sadist who never raises his voice but speaks in near whispers (to show contained rage I guess--but it's a cliché).I like action pictures a lot--but not when there are plot holes the size of Arnold's neck every 10 minutes, and an ending that doubles the size of those holes.There's nothing original here and you feel like you are participating in an exercise in making others wealthier--producers and actors who don't care at all about what they are creating. Even Arnold's natural charm rarely shows through here.The filmmakers seem to want to draw comparisons to Gitmo or other detention facilities that are related to anti terrorism--thus the quasi waterboarding, the presence of Moslems, etc. Note to filmmakers--please keep your simplistic political opinions to yourself. And make better movies.Particularly irritating is the use of a Moslem character (and I do mean use) to illustrate the writer's/director's political leanings. When at one point in the movie a character (MINOR SPOILER HERE) who is clearly Moslem kills prison guards while yelling God is Great (in Arabic), you must be tone deaf and lost in a sea of irrational political correctness. This is what is chanted when terrorists crash planes in sky scrapers or blow themselves up on buses. There's nothing heroic about it and such scenes in movies not only don't belong but are irritating and make you feel cheated.",Escape Plan

It feels that every movie I watch Stallone doing now, he is just coasting through it. I just never get the feeling that he has become the characters he is representing on the screen. Yes, his movies do still succeed in entertaining a little, but gone are the days that we should expect another Rambo or Rocky. The final line of the movie was especially hard to watch. Stallone said the line so awkwardly that you would never believe he had ever said it in real life. And please don't ever cast him as a genius, he just can't pull that off. So, if you're expecting anything more than what you've seen Stallone do in the last few years, you will be disappointed.

The movie is a bit unevenly paced though. It starts off well with the first prison escape sequence well executed. Then is slows down a bit and then gathers momentum towards the end. One thing I noticed was that the lead pair were not given equal footage. Stallone clearly gets the maximum screen time and Arnold, well, is also present ... never making it out of the Stallone shadows.Watch it if you are an hardcore Stallone fan. Others, watch it for the story.",Escape Plan
278,aravindia75,OK for a single viewing + the curiosity of watching two former action stars together!,6,18 October 2013,"I admit I am an 80s/90s guy meaning I loved the movies and culture from this era! We didn't have internet, smart phones, face book for entertainment and going to the movies was our definition of entertainment! It was during this time we had major actions stars like Stallone and Schwarzenegger! It can be said Stallone ruled the 80s with movies like Rambo and Rocky and though Schwarzenegger was also a star in his own right during the 80s it was only in the 90s when he achieved super stardom with Terminator 2! So it can be said the 80s belonged to Stallone and 90s to Schwarzenegger! Like myself millions of fans of both of these stars yearned to watch a movie starring both of them! Alas we never got to see the teaming up of them together as far as movies were concerned but got some sort of compensation when they teamed up to start the Planet Hollywood restaurant chain (which sadly died a slow death) So almost after like 20-25 years wish of many fans got sort of fulfilled when they came together to star in The tomb which for reasons best known to the producers had its name changed to Escape Plan! I must admit I was a bit sad that Stallone got more prominence in the trailer of this movie than Schwarzenegger and felt he was playing a glorified sidekick but while watching the movie I was pleasantly surprised that Schwarzenegger got almost equal screen time as Stallone and delivers what he does best - chutzpah filled one liners! Yeah folks you will get to see some great one liners delivered by Schwarzenegger and he steals the scene many times! So you can assume although Stallone is technical the main protagonist of this movie its Schwarzenegger who gets more attention! I have always wondered why Schwarzeneggger did lots of actioners when he would have made a great Comedic stars as inspite of his many flaws he sure can pull great comedy! Now regarding the movie as a whole I must admit it was quite boring and there were far too many characters and complex technical stuff mentioned that after a while you lose interested though Schwarzenegger does manage to sort of keep entertained! In a movie where tiny details are told in form of dialogue the director should have employed an actor with a clear voice! Its well known that Stallone has a gravely thick voice and its kinda hard interpreting his dialogues and in a movie where technical stuff is spoken through dialogue a different actor would have been a better choice! Finally though us fans are happy to see two of our favourite action stars together after so many years we sure would have loved to watch them in a old school 80s/90s fast paced actioner with lots of fights, car chases etc.",Escape Plan

However, I actually enjoyed it and it kept me entertained for several action packed hours. Even if for the most part it was very predictable.There was very little on why the other prisoners were there. Also why a such a prison would bother respecting any of the prisoners rights. Eg Allow them to integrate with one another.

The plot follows along with the ""escapades"" of agent Breslin(Stylone) and cohort(Schwarzenegger). The main appeal is the quality of the cinematics with the darker tones of the prison systems finely relating the theme of entrapment. It is here where the dialogue really shines as the protagonists endeavor to make the right moves. A stark contrast can be seen here with the persistence of the wards to withhold the inmate team from freedom. This becomes the primary storyline as the team struggle though their whereabouts. Hardship is kinda the elephant in the room here but if you can hand the over-the-top action scenes and somewhat funny audio then there is much entertainment value in this film.",Escape Plan

This doesn't deserve the rating.First half of the film is fine, interesting prison break out like stuff, Stallone works alone stealth fully. But I guess when you're in the world's most inescapable prison the only option you have is guns.Normally, you don't spend much time worrying about the bad guys in films like this, they're clearly setup as bad but 99.9% of the bodies were prison guards. Stallone is a pure good guy, we get his story. No ambiguity there. Arnold, not clear on why he's in this type of prison. He works for someone they want info on. Maybe I was too daft to follow the plot on exactly why he's there. Whatever, Stallone needs his help. They get a third guy on board, who is definitely a ne'er-do-well, and then they go on a murder spree pilling up prison guard bodies along the way. The End.And then I guess we're supposed to leave the movie theater happy and relived the good guys have won again.",Escape Plan
284,Seismicor,"Great movie, I dug it a lot",9,18 October 2013,"There were maybe only a few misses in the screenplay but overall it was a really enjoyable ride. It was very obvious that Arnie enjoyed making it. There was a lot of moments that reminded me the joy of watching the best Arnold's movies in the eighties. Also the good thing about this movie is that Arnie didn't play himself like in the Expendables. The pace was very good. The action in the third act was great, too. I like how they had a lot of curse words in the script, something you don't see in the movies nowadays. Jim Caviezel is a wonderful actor and so was his performance as the sleazy warden. There were funny moments and they worked really well, everybody in the cinema was laughing when they occurred. I believe the scene where Arnold tries to catch warden's attention by talking out loud in his mother tongue (german) while Stallone was exploring back of the prison will be classic in the foreseeable future. I'm so glad that Escape Plan was made. It's bound to be my favorite action movie of the 2010's. Can't wait for Sabotage!",Escape Plan
285,BudrodaHooligan,Great movie and could have been excellent,8,18 October 2013,"This is my second review and I don't like to make it a habit of writing them since English is not my native language, but here goes. I will not try to spoil the story but I will describe Arnold's presence in the movie since he stole the show..The movie starts how Sly breaks out of a prison. It figures since that is his job. But it sets the mood of his character which later comes clear why he does what he does. The story goes pretty fast. He is back in the office and he's already asked to break out of another prison... THE prison. From there the movie starts with Arnold.This is a tense movie at certain parts. The best part is the middle where he discovers exactly what the prison is. And this is where I switch to Arnold's acting.The guy has 2 modes of acting, where as most good actors have more. That doesn't say he is a bad actor. He is good for silence and presence --> Terminator and Conan the Barbarian And he is good for going all at it. His serious normal speaking mode is where he is lacking unfortunately... My opinion of course. In this movie he brings out the most laughs. He even has a hilarious blowjob line. Best part is where he speaks in HIS native language all crazy and stuff, while Stallone was doing another Daylight.The ending is good and has all the gunplay action, but it isn't great. This is where I have opposite feelings. It was badly shot or edited and yet again this is where Arnold shines when they film him so greatly while grabbing a big gun (a nod to his 80s/90s movies) and he starts to wreak mayhem.Of course the movie ends with a small twist to wrap it all up.Overall I loved the movie. It is a great thriller with a few tense moments. Storywise it succeeded in keeping the viewer glued to the seat I am glad to see Sly and Arnold together enjoying themselves. Don't expect lots of bloody action since this is primarily a thriller.",Escape Plan
286,zevcookie,Brilliant!,8,31 March 2014,"This movie is fun, awesome and very likely one of my favorites in the action genre. The plot is straightforward yet engaging. I actually cringed at the scene when Rottmayer revealed himself and Breslin responded ""Didn't see that coming."" - like really? Okay, that apart, the rest is really good with excellent cast and bad-ass acting. I love the fact that this movie is packed with high-paced action, smart plans but nothing overboard, an adequate explanation about the protagonist's past, and no romance stuff. Also, gotta love that attitude of Breslin - ""There's always plan B."" Touché!My favorite catchphrase in this movie may be the ""Have a nice day, asshole!"" line. So satisfying! After all, Ray Breslin is a man of his words. The final revenge act should have been more stern, but don't mind me - it's entirely personal preference.All in all, this is a must-watch for every action fan out there.",Escape Plan

And unfortunately I have to it admit that I found it rather underwhelming. If you, like me, are a fan of Sly and/or Arnie its an okay movie. I as a Schwarzenegger fan felt like he wasn't used enough, and the focus was to much on Stallone. The plot is paper thin, but to be honest what else did you expect and the action is decent but nothing spectacular or out of the ordinary. I really liked the premise and concept of the movie, but I fell flat and throughout I felt like they could have done more with it. But it shows that the main cast Arnold, Stallone, Vinnie Jones and Jim Caviezel clearly had fun making this movie and that helps a lot.Overall it didn't deliver what I hoped it would and that is good old fashioned action a la Expendables or the Last Stand. It just didn't live up to its potential and so I can only give it a 6 out of 10, albeit it scrapes the 7. In conclusion, if you like the two main stars, you can watch it, if you don't I say skip this one.",Escape Plan
290,juarezajj,Better late than never.,7,26 January 2014,"First off, seeing Sly Stallone and Arnold together in a movie is a dream come true! Sure they have the Expendables, but that is a shared film with a multitude of action heroes. These are the two biggest action stars EVER who once competed in the 80's and 90's for best action movie of all time!!! So for them to team up means a lot to me and maybe more so than to others. There are other notable side characters in the film as well, such as Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson, Vinnie Jones, Vincent D'Onofrio and Sam Neill, but everyone who is wanting to see this film will mostly care about our two headliners.Being labeled as an action movie, there isn't much to say really about the film other than its a modern day escape movie with a somewhat decent plot. Sly Stallone plays a professional escape artist who escapes prisons for a living and wrote the book on how a prison should be properly maintained. He ends up taking a job that promises big pay, but with even bigger danger. On this job he meets Arnold and together they try to abscond the ultimate prison facility. Catchy and more in line of a thriller than action, but it has it's moments.One of the first things that stood out for me was how interesting the chemistry between these two legends played out on screen. They actually make an awesome team together! I couldn't help but feel like they should have done this YEARS earlier when they were both in their prime! Better late then never though! The next thing I noticed was given that these two usually played the macho role in past films, it was a little weird to see Sly act as a VERY intellectual person. I mean, this man was spitting out facts of metal and liquid elements that you wouldn't even think of! Boiling point of metal, navigational and geographical information, material temperature. I don't really see Sly in such a role, but he managed well and I was pleasantly taken aback by it.Sly wasn't the only one to surprise though. Yes, Arnold had his macho-ism and had intelligence as well, but his biggest surprise was when he spoke his native German language. That might not be a big deal to certain people, but as a long time fan and someone that has seen A lot of his movies I've NEVER heard him speak German in any of them! Maybe I missed one, I can't claim to see them all, but definitely A lot.Anyways, back to my thoughts of the movie overall. The culmination of the greatest hero icons mixed with an advanced inescapable prison facility was definitely entertaining in a way I partially didn't expect and that's not a bad thing. The ending was a little disappointing for me though and sometimes that can ruin an entire movie. That wasn't the case here, but it's worth mentioning just for the sake of my opinion.Final verdict: If you are fans of the legends in this film, enjoy thriller/action movies or just want to see a modern day escape movie with your worst case scenario prison facility (makes me wonder if there really is a facility like this) then this is for you. I personally think anyone could enjoy this movie. Hell, even my wife was interested and saw it, lol.",Escape Plan

This is how an action movie should be made, Sly delivers once again, Arnie was great for his one liners.....Oscar watchers, don't come here, enjoy your boring crap, this is entertainment !! This movie was not all dumb, there were some sequences which had to be put in order to make it more entertaining, the climax was great too ! Stallone fans don't miss this one !!

But if you're prepared to ignore them, the movie romps along and is much more enjoyable than you might credit.Stallone and Schwarzenegger turn in credible performances, but the dialog they're given is often a bit lacking, even for the strong, silent, heroic types they portray. Jim Caviezel does OK with what he's given, as he does in Person of Interest. But the character misses some pretty obvious things, which makes him look a bit silly.The final shootout is typically action-film ridiculous. But that's OK. The denouement is actually pretty good, but could have been fleshed out a little more. You want to see a certain guy get his come-uppance and it ends up a little anti-climactic, I felt. But good fun, with plenty of surprises.I recommend it. And I'd watch it again.",Escape Plan

Negative points : plot holes you could drive a truck through (a shortage of black armour faced guards is suddenly replaced with a veritable mob of them suddenly appearing to literally throw themselves on Arnies guns), questionable acting (when Vinnie Jones notices something on the monitors is he querying what he is seeing or is he having a hard time on the toilet), terrible dialogue, predictable ending.

And the GREAT PLOT with PLOT TWISTS. Also GREAT ACTION. And GREAT ACTING. This can only mean three things: these people are A) paid by the movie company, B) threatened by the movie company C) retarded.The acting is bad, even for Stallone and Schwarzenegger standards. The camera is all over the place. What people probably mistake for great action is just the camera guy having Parkinson's disease, or just trying hard not to laugh out loud. The directing is slow and uninspired. The 50 million $ budget must have gone to the two main leads since the props in this flick look like they were taken from a B-movie set. It's all cheap and gray and drab. The script is so incredibly dumb my dog figured out the plot twist halfway through the movie.SPOILER WARNING: It's not Bloc C! OMG it's Block B! OMG the Muslim is a friend!!! What wit! SPOLERS END Hilarious. Or at least it would be if the movie didn't take itself so damn serial. I liked how the protagonist used his awesome brain powers and uncanny planning to unscrew a screw. That was movie gold people! It took me back to the days of McGyver. I would have loved to see him make some explosives out of, let's say a shoelace, mattress stuffing and a squirt of semen. It would have fit right in with the general flow of this masterpiece. I could go on for another hour dissecting this movie for faults and fails. No point, really. If you liked THE EXPANDABLES I am truly sorry for you. Also THE ESCAPE PLAN is much worse.

I'm a big fan of Arnie and Stallone I'm an 80's child and grew up with Terminator and Rambo. I saw Last Stand when it came out and i was pleasantly surprised and it was great to see Arnie back on screen and in a decent role. I expected something similar with Escape Plan but what i got was a slightly confusing, rather boring and dull prison escape film. The film starts out well and for the first 20 minutes or so i was pretty into it but as the film went on i just kind of lost interest. It was nice to see Arnie and Stallone in a film together but i think they could have picked a better project.I think that this film was a bit of a middle of the road job, i wouldn't really call it an action film but it's also not a drama, no comedy that i can really remember either.

Nope but it's a pretty good teaming of arguably the two biggest action movies stars ever.An interesting thing is even if Stallone plays the main character, Schwarzenegger also gets his moments and at times the leading role switches between the two. Both also deliver respectable performances, even if sometimes Stallone's face lifts give him some uncertain expressions.The story is simple, there isn't much left unanswered and if you keep in mind this is the movie in which Sly & Arnold finally team up to beat bad guys, minor plot holes can be easily forgiven.Has the movie been made 30 years ago there would probably have been a lot more shooting and cheesy one-liners but the way Escape Plan was made, it suits the fact both Stallone and Schwarzenegger aren't in their prime anymore.8/10, had to give 1 point just for Arnold's getting-and-shooting-with- the-machine-gun moment towards the end.

The best thing is there was no blood dropping but all lost at the second part of the movie. The hero who works for the sake of the innocent people; ended the movie as a big criminal, there was no mind games, luck came in and with the blood; the movie lost all of its selling points.

A drive by would be much cheaper... oh wait, of course, they needed a Muslim in this movie for Stalones escape plan. And then, last and least: Neil. A drunken doctor haunted by guilt, who tries to redeem himself with helping with the prison break. I was damn close to leave the cinema, but i got still popcorn left and the tickets are too expensive to waste them... tl;dr - worst movie i saw this year, Schwarzeneggers worst acting ever, even worst plot, conversations written by an ape and everybody who gives this film more then 4 stars saw another movie",Escape Plan

It is a solid movie almost in every aspects, the actions, the plot, the jokes and all the funny moments. And it just gets better with a surprising ending.Stallone still played the cool guy in the movie but a clever cool guy, and Schwarzenegger is the one who brought in the fun part which I feel really showed a different side of him.I would recommend the movie to anyone.",Escape Plan

It's a pity, because the idea is nice, an ultramodern prison on a boat. But I guess the million cameras in ultramodern prisons are not deactivated just hand- punching one of them ""because they're in a network"".Unfortunately, once our beloved friends get into the prison innards we see technology older than ""the rock"" back in the 60's, with all those fancy and dangerous pipes and fumes, etc... The bad guy is of course the stereotypical evil warden you expect, that collects butterflies and all and micromanages everything himself, from paperwork to cleaning the interns' undies, etc. Then what was supposed to be a white collar silent escape turns into a total Rambo/Terminator mayhem where a supposed innocent civilian (Rambo) goes berserk and starts assassinating the prison crew without mercy, with the help of some helicopter that happened to come from the outside with heavy machine guns. They all together violently punish their customer and spread random death, not only demonstrating the escape from the prison is possible, but also demolishing the whole installation and killing the crew, the prisoners and their pets.Nothing makes sense in this pathetic movie. It is an insult to any human being looking for coherence, but hey, what you want is some fun with Stallone & Schwarzenegger together, so I guess the rest is forgiven.

The Villains are excellent too , with Jim Caviezel proving what a good actor he is because despite not matching the big two in physical stature his natural screen presence easily makes for that and Big Vinnie is well cast the corrupt prison guard. all in all a excellent 80's/90's throwback thriller which I loved ! go and see it !",Escape Plan
315,enriko-78991,Review,9,21 January 2020,"The film escape plan is one of those great feature films that surprise both their storyline and the great combination of two actors. Arnold Schwarzeneggr and Sylvester Stallone. The story takes place in a modern prison that was built from the technical advice of a tester who has been testing the safety of prisons in America all his life. Unfortunately, when he was given the opportunity to test this prison, he did not expect that he would never get out of prison again. Probably it is because of confirmation the effect of the binding built from his notes and advice. Secondly, his colleague at work also wanted him to disappear from the world. All the while he's there, he's planning on getting out, even though he knows the prison is built according to his advice. He has to deal with unpleasant guards and a corrupt director every day. Many of his plans in prison have led to cruel and inhuman punishments. But after all, he finds out how everything works and how to get out. Than, he gets out of prison and avenges his colleague. The whole movie is a great choice if you have nothing to do or want to have fun on the action characters.",Escape Plan

317,irvinlimadiazcele,My point of view about this movie,10,20 May 2021,"Escape plan is a film directed by the Swedish Mikael Hafstrom. It is a mix between action and thriller, this film is set in the United States in a NASA facility.In this movie, the main characters are Ray Breslin and his organization, they are the best testing how safe prisons are.... This time Ray Breslin is hired to test one of the safest prisons on an island, but that he doesn't known is that one man of his organization will betray him who intends to imprison him forever.The great strength of this movie is the skills that Ray Breslin has and the resources that he use to discover where the prison is located, since he was kidnapped and betrayed by a colleague. My only criticism is that the special effects are very unreal in some scenes but on the whole all is fine.This is one of the best movies that I have seen because the plot is very interesting and I recommend this movie for all lovers of action movies.",Escape Plan
318,turk-41,Great movie with every star used perfectly,10,19 October 2013,"I really liked the movie. Having seen the Expendables movies I was expecting more of the same type of stuff with Sly and Arnold together but it was completely different and felt original.Sylvester Stallone was very convincing as the expert, Arnold was very funny as usual(there are some hilarious scenes between these two as well) and Jim Caviezel also did a fantastic job as the main villain. Even 50 cent surprisingly did well as a tech nut sidekick.The director and producers did well by dealing with the advanced ages of the main stars and were able to finish the movie with a very nerve wrecking and exciting ending.Would watch again, and would love a sequel.",Escape Plan
319,erlinggur,"Decent action, but trying to be more clever than it is.",7,30 January 2014,"This movie was pretty decent, it did try to be more clever than it was. It's not flawless. No movie is and when Stallone and Arnold are in it its worth watching. The thing that took me by surprise was Arnold's Acting, he played actually good and not over the-top neither did Stallone. I saw it without subtitles and i can understand why some doesn't gets its plot, because the two are pretty hard to understand sometimes. In one of the first scene Stallone greets a Warden, and i swear to god i thought he said ""What up"" instead of ""Warden"". The best scene most be with the scenes where Arnold is co-acting with the bad Guy Jim Caviezel. The Bad guy here is the kind of really evil bastard, your meant to hate but he is kind of funny. His death was a laugh, it was cheesy and i loved it. This is not a movie with the biggest explosions, its a Arnie and Sly film with a cool bad guy. The plot is predictable really, there is a twist who didn't take me by surprise but i guess its a trend to have some twists and curls in action movies these days. This is not a movie i'm going to buy, but if you like movies with Sly and Arnold and you want to see them together. Even now when they are old, they are pretty badass in this movie. I recommend it because it's fun, funny, good chemistry with the two action elders. 7/10",Escape Plan

There is no thick plot or real complexities, it's a simple bad guys Vs good guys action flick. However, the movie does not disappoint, its very entertaining and full of action and hard core scenes. The acting is as expected, nothing Oscar worthy but good enough from action legends like them. The idea is simple and is easily understood. The one difference in this movie is that the chemistry between Schwarzenegger and Stallone is excellent and they deliver some humor also. The only downside that I can think about is the fact that this movie is really meant for both the stars fans and not people who are looking for real ideas or excellent cinematography. Bottom line go enjoy the movie and don't forget your popcorn.",Escape Plan
321,esplorer25,Stallone and Schwarzie surprised me!,6,29 May 2014,"My first review is about the new movie with 2 of the biggest action actors in the world coming together. Wanted to say a few words about this one, because it was a little surprise for me! The movie starts with the presentation of an unusual profession - 1st surprise, who has a work like that? I was expecting some big fight scenes between Stalone and Schwarzie characters, but that is not what happens! - 2nd surprise! there are fists flying yes! but it's a ""necessary evil""... Jim Caviezel is the 3rd surprise for me, he plays a great villain! In contrast with 50 Cent... (what the hell is he doing there?!) The downside is that the movie is a bit predictable from the beginning: after you know about the unusual profession, you get to see what will happen. Nevertheless, it has a nice twist in the middle (not going to say!) and a reeaaly funny scene (made me laugh hard!) near the end! It's not great but it's a really good action movie. I find it to be a mix of ""lock up"" and ""the last castle"". So, i guess if you like any of these two i think you will really like ""Escape Plan""!",Escape Plan

SLy and Arnie were very realistic and blended nicely together. I forgot about both of their big Hollywood profiles while watching it. Sam Neill added a nice touch too. The set was well designed and interesting. I'm really surprised this movie does not have a higher rating. It was absolutely a joy to watch!,Escape Plan

Expecting a painful to watch ""one last go around"" project for a couple of aging action stars, this action film was actually pretty entertaining. Both of the old guys played their roles expertly and seem to have embraced their recent career success as seniors that can still throw a punch. Arnie seems to have finally picked up a few acting skills and Stallone seems more punch drunk than ever but leverages that into some believable character development. All in all pleasantly surprised that Escape Plan wasn't the disaster it could have been. And both Stallone and Schwarzenegger throw in some great lines and moves that hearken back to the roles that made them famous and enshrined them in our collective consciousness.",Escape Plan

Once again you have a good guy/ bad guy opposition and the interpretation from the actors is not outstanding either. Your appreciation of the movie totally depends on how much you like the two main actors. Thus I would not recommend it if you are not attached to those two actors. This movie is a ""muscled"" and shorter version of Prison Break season 1. I rated 8/10 because it's hilarious to see Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger play roles where they use their brain too. This movie displays on screen violence but it should be OK to watch, unless you are very sensitive to this.",Escape Plan
326,rambo-romeo,About time the two giants of cinema come together!!,10,14 October 2013,"Let me start by saying that the fact alone Schwarzenegger and Stallone are in their 60's doing a film like this is the ultimate reason to watch this. I can never understand why people claim they are too old. If anything they put people half their age to shame with their physical abilities and they should inspire people to want to stay energetic well into their senior years. This movie is absolute Gold! We finally have the two biggest movie stars of all time headlining a movie together and believe me you get what you pay for! The action and visuals were what I expected, very clear and stunning. The prison was almost a character itself in making the audience feel apart of the setting. My hat goes off to the director who was able to balance the off-screen chemistry between Stallone and Schwarzenegger and fuse it into the story. No joke these two guys were made to star in a movie together. The nostalgia is off the roof!! Every movie has its flaws and no doubt this one did but in saying that, I was able to automatically ignore them here because of the story, it was well paced. We see Stallone's character introduced as a prison security expert who is set up and put into the worlds most secure prison. Here he teams up with none other than Schwarzenegger who plays another prisoner, pretty much ""the one you don't mess with"". Together they plot their escape and it is done superbly! Overall I think this movie is a well made action thriller and will surprise audiences with something they haven't seen before from both Arnold and Sly. I will be surprised if this film doesn't get much attention at the box office because this movie goes back to a time when Hollywood was larger than life and gave us memorable characters and memorable action scenes. 10/10",Escape Plan
327,moviestarneil,Better than advertised. You will end up liking it.,8,9 November 2013,"I'm glad I went and saw this movie. Before I went, I was really worried it might let me down because it wasn't making a lot of money (in theaters), but it turned out to be a decently good movie that was actually quite enjoyable. After seeing this, I honestly think a lot of people overlooked this movie for some reason or another and missed a really fun and enjoyable experience.You might want to understand that this is NOT exactly an action movie, it is more of a tale about a prison break attempt. Once you understand that, you will enjoy and appreciate the movie more for what it really is. I certainly did and I was pleased enough with the plot and the difficulty of the challenges the heroes faced and watching them try to figure out what to do.Arnold and Sly are perfect on-screen buddies and I really enjoyed their conversations and their moments together, whether it was serious or funny. You will get some good laughs out of it. It also gets quite serious and dangerous at moments and makes you realize it's no walk in the park. I hope Arnold & Sly do more buddy movies together in the future. It was very awesome for me watching my childhood heroes be in the same movie together again.I have got to mention and praise Jim Caviezel. I can see why they chose him for his part. His performance seemed so real that it's hard to believe that he's just acting. He is that good and that convincing. When you watch this movie, you will see what I'm talking about.This movie is really good and I strongly recommend it. It may not have made a lot of money, but after having seen it, I am glad that Arnold & Sly chose to do this movie.

(the burned bodies)From the Character. as usual of Stallone , i'll leave it to you because this guy is amazing. also for Arnold, why always he is identical with a machine gun? and last, the antagonist person. i expect he more vicious more powerful like a devil king whom invincible, unfortunately in this movie he's not so powerful and vicious. but instead, i think he's more like a king with a crumbled forces and easy to kill.Enjoyment in this movie is still a Stallone Class. started with a boom, ends with a boom. this movie is simply great! but a few things still destroying this movie",Escape Plan

Casting Sly and Arny was the icing on the cake. I think the script was decent, the directing great (it actually made me feel involved), and the acting was choice. It was done well. No old timer jokes, no spoofing, just another movie I want to own. The ending was almost as pleasing as ""Inglorious Bastards'"" conclusion. Nothing like seeing someone get what's coming to them.I also thought Arnold was just going to be in it for a minute, nope.

333,kevmonsta1,You shouldn't have high expectations for this film,7,21 October 2013,"Honestly, it's just a ball of fun and entertainment. Basically, a slightly generic popcorn movie. Nothing mind-boggling or deep. The plot leading up to the climax and ending is predictable, but I highly doubt there's more to see in a movie like this.I bought a ticket and walked into the theater expecting cheesy one- liners, gunfire, and humor. That's all I ask for in an action movie such as this one, and both Stallone and Schwarzenegger delivered as they were supposed to. The chemistry between both of their characters was there, but for some reason I felt as though it was lacking a bit. Just a tad bit.I felt as though 50 Cent's role was completely underwhelming and unnecessary. I'm not too sure if it's just his stale acting or whatever, but I feel as though someone else could have filled in that role more fittingly. The same goes for most of the supporting actors/actresses (specifically Amy Ryan and Sam Neill) with the exception of Jim Caviezel , who played Warden Hobbs. In my opinion, Caviezel embodied his part fantastically despite Hobbs being a rather one-dimensional villain. I was intrigued by his whole butterfly metaphor and I really wish they fleshed out his character more, but alas this movie was more focused on the two leading titans. Nevertheless, I enjoyed every moment he had, and it's safe to say that he stole a few scenes right under the leads' noses. Neill's doctor role could have used some fleshing out as well. It's like he was there and served his purpose for Stallone's character then disappeared from the film, becoming nothing more than a forgettable remnant. Neill definitely deserves better than a character like that, but he delivered the script as best he could. Overall, I'd say this is worth a rental as soon as it comes out on DVD. It's also worth seeing in theaters if you have some leisure time to waste away, and if you've already seen the bigger films such as Gravity, Captain Phillips, etc. Recommended to all Stallone + Schwarzennegar (even Caviezel) fans around.",Escape Plan

But, it is a movie and you know it is a movie, so criticizing a movie because of such small details would be useless.I would recommend to watch this movie with some friends, this isn't a movie you would watch on a first date.

OK the story isn't exactly what you would call believable but then again you wouldn't really expect it to be. This is big bucks, top flight, gold star good old fashioned Hollywood entertainment and it delivers on the promises of an action packed 'thriller' movie. The twist at the end isn't too hard on the little grey cells but then again you wouldn't want it to be - no one want to have to think that hard for a good night out at the movies.

Re-fonk-a-tarded. I get why the prison operates, money, but why would governments pay that much money to make someone disappear but keep them alive? It's much more cost effective to kill them.I did like Jim Caviezel as the evil warden because, let's face it, he's just plain sexy and Jim as a bad guy is sexier than all get out.Even after all the bad acting, predictable plot, and silly prison boat (and let me tell you, that made me sick for personal phobic reasons) I still enjoyed it.

Arnold Swarzherneggar was really enjoying himself, you could tell - and the part where he started reciting The Lord's Prayer to the guy who played Jesus in ""The Passion of the Christ"" was classic. The casting of Australians to be the bad- guys-in-charge was very witty - and the twists in the story were delightful. If you enjoyed ""The Game"" with Michael Douglas and how your jaw dropped at the moment of revelation, you will have a good time with this movie. Loved how Stallone always walks off with the blond girl - he did that in ""The Grudge Match"" also. Truly under-rated and badly marketed. SO glad we watched this.

342,Alkhawam-Mohammed,Thorough analysis of the film.,8,3 April 2014,"Many movies fail to live up to the hype, but Escape Plan defies expectations. The storyline, characters, and other elements were excellent, but not perfect.To kick it off, let's start with the storyline. Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone),a former prosecutor, tests maximum security prisons for a living. He finds a way to escape these prisons, and fixes their faults. Later, he receives a multi-million dollar deal by CIA agent Jessica Miller (Caitriona Balfe), without his special rules. Imprisoned under the name Portos, an assumed terrorist, Breslin eventually meets fellow inmate Emil Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger) who stages a fight for Breslin to study the solitary confinement cell.At the end, his goal is to escape the prison, and let's leave it at that. Also, The supporting cast that usually helps him in escaping these prisons, Abigail Ross (Amy Ryan) and Hush (Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson), are not even involved in the storyline and have little to no contribution in the film. Next, we have the actors portraying the characters. Arnold Schwarzenegger does his role with utmost perfection. He uses the correct tone throughout the movie, and shows the true personality of Emil Rottmayer. At one point of the movie, he even slightly laughs while playing around with the prison keeper , Willard Hobbes (Jim Caviezel); However, Stallone was quite the opposite. He struggled in a few lines, and barely showed the tough, impenetrable character of Ray Breslin.Also, the director (Mikael Håfström) didn't disappoint. He showed the thrilling elements and creativity that he provided to the movie. Similar to his previous film, The Rite (2011 film), he choose a few smart elements such as the guards wearing masks to make their actions less predictable, and many others. He should be commended for the amazing job has been doing to the movies he directs.Finally, the visuals of the movie was quite stunning. It had an extreme amount of clear, exasperating scenes. At the defined detail of the prisons, and the characters was an absolute joy to watch.At the end, Escape Plan, as a whole, didn't disappoint. It lived up to the expectations, and was an absolute thrill to watch. It deserves a sequel, and if done, may make an interesting chronological series to watch.",Escape Plan

344,Aljabi-Nasouh,Critical Review,10,2 April 2014,"Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone),a former Prosecutor,who tests the security of the prisons. He always Finds A way to Break These Prisons,and Telling the plan He Managed to escape with to the prison's Keepers to Fix the Weak Points . Later A CIA Agent Jessica Miller (Caitriona Balfe) gave him a Deal ,for Some Millions Of Dollars, to Imprison, in an prison that the Keeper Hobbes ""Jim Caviezel"" of it have read Breslin's book and kept an eye on every single weak point in the other prisons and made sure the there is not a single point that he didn't cover, under The Name Portos, an Terrorist, and without informing his teammates of his Place of the prison . He Finally Meets Emil Rottmayer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) And They Act As if they are fighting to help Breslin prospect the solitary Cell.The Actors Portraying the Characters Are perfect . We can notice that Arnold Schwarzenegger Played The role of Rottmayer perfectly and Precisely and he always Laugh While Teasing the prison Keeper Hobbes Which was always angry . Sylvester Stallone Played the role of Ray Breslin, that always kept quiet and kept thinking of the ways to escape the prison.Escape Plan Exceeded my Expectations and didn't disappointed me at all rather it was a thrill to watch .",Escape Plan
345,sallyahoney36,Boring,1,8 November 2014,"Ever wondered how Arnie or Sly would go with acting just with dialogue - now we all know, awful. One word sums this film up, or attempt at being a film -BORING. There is more interest in the supporting cast than the so-called major top billings. Unfortunately too little screen time is given to the real actors (D'Onofrio, Neil, Jones, Caviezel) as the film is monopolized by the egos of Stallone & Schwarnegger as they stagger and look bewildered as they fumble trying to perform to dramatic lines. And Arnie - the stare doesn't work anymore! Any positive rating given to this movie is way too generous and would insult far better escape movies such as Escape From Alcatraz.",Escape Plan
346,paul-bradley88,Your gonna get what you expect,7,7 March 2015,"Its exactly what you'd want from two old battlers. The other half is on a night out, or baby has just gone off to bed and and you want to watch a blast from the past. Slys silicone face holds up the first 30 mins, with gangster rapper ""Fidy"" actually playing a nerdy know-it-all well. The usual smooth Sly has control of all his world until bam! Life takes a turn, The high pitched score and 80's black outs kept-ed me watching until Sly is in a no win situation, who can help him when trumpets and heavy strings take over. You know who. Its not as bad as they would have you think, If you know what to expect from an Arnie/Sly movie in the 2000's you wont be disappointed. Easy no brainier after a few beers. Thanks for reading :)",Escape Plan
347,mattstenson,Don't know why the low rating?,10,13 August 2021,"This film is a masterpiece. Heaps of action, suspense, and plot twists. Should be a 8.5/10 at the very least.Great performances by Arnie and Stallone.",Escape Plan
348,eramirez-19081,"Entertaining, With 2 of the Best Ever!",8,28 June 2015,"I'll admit it. I grew up watching Stallone and Schwarzenegger, and I generally like all the films they've made. They are a good fit for this story, and the whole cast really is great. I give props to both S & S because they really do share the lead throughout the film, and props to Jim Caviezel who is also a great actor. I give it an 8 because it's got the good feel of 'The Running Man,' and 'Demolition Man.' Both of those were good stories that were well suited for these actors at the time, and were entertaining in so many ways. This is another one to add to their lists of entertaining movies. Another reason it's an 8? Well, I am sure I will see it many times in the future with others, so I look forward to that.",Escape Plan
349,namansogani,Great action thriller! Combination of Arnold and Stallone is amazing!,9,24 August 2015,"Escape Plan is a clever action thriller movie starring Sylvester Stallone(as Ray Breslin), Arnold Schwarzenegger(as Emil Rottmayer),Jim Caviezel(as Hobbes), Curtis Jackson(as Hush), Amy Ryan(as Abigail Ross) and Vincent D'Onofrio(as Lester Clark). The movie is based on Ray Breslin who co-owns a security firm with Lester Clark, and gets paid for going in the prisons and testing the security arrangements by breaking out from there.All goes well until one day when he is hired for another such duty but finds himself in completely isolated and secure prison managed by Hobbes, totally cut-off from the other people of his firm(Ross and Hush). He soon figures out that the information provided to him about this location was wrong and it looks like this time he might get defeated. He then meets with a fellow inmate in the prison (Arnold) who is also trying to escape from the prison. They both team up to get out of the prison unfolding a chain of events occurred.Its a good action film with not much rock solid acting from Stallone and Arnold, but then what more do you want from these two action stars! Seeing both these working together is in itself satisfying with a bit of humour mixed with some thrilling action. Jim Caviezel plays his role of a typical egoistic and ruthless warden very proficiently. Overall its a worth watching movie and you will not get disappointed for sure.",Escape Plan
350,facilities,Worst makeup EVER!!!,5,13 October 2021,I am not someone who ever sees or even notices makeup but Stallone looks like a corpse! It's absolutely the worst makeup I have ever seen on film! To the point of absolutely distraction!!!!!!,Escape Plan

352,jordananthonybastow,Turned off after 10 mins,1,29 March 2020,Conveniently this prison has a security pin code keeping him in his sell not a key. He can also reach out of his cell to access this code. Also no other door is locked and walls straight out without anyone seeing.,Escape Plan
353,glillis-47839,Great movie,10,14 May 2017,"I watched this movie on TV not knowing what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. The cast was great...the story line was great...it kept me on the edge of my seat. I give it the highest rating. You don't have to be a young actor/actress to make a great movie. The main characters, although mostly not in their younger years, still know how to act and do it very, very well. I say to all who have not given this movie a good review ""watch it again, you really missed it!!!""",Escape Plan
