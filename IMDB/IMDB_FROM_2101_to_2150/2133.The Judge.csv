0,MartinHafer,Really nice acting and a nice score and characters you really don't care about in the least.,8,13 June 2015,"on screen vomiting big courtroom scene is pretty silly and hard to believe""The Judge"" is a very good film and the best part about it is the acting. Seeing Robert Downey and Robert Duvall at work is a treat and for this reason the film is well worth your time. However, I also realize that the movie won't appeal to everyone because the main characters in the film are rather unlikable.When the film begins, you learn that Hank Palmer (Downey) is a hot- shot defense attorney who will do just about anything to win his case. He also has a habit of working with very rich and powerful but very evil clients and it doesn't seem to bother him in the least. His life, in some ways, is great--he's rich and he has a sweet daughter. But, his wife cannot stand him and you get the impression that she's cheating on him because he's simply unable to be a loving husband. Into this world comes news that Hank's estranged father, Joseph (Duvall) is sick--and so he very reluctantly returns to his home town to see the guy. But it's obvious that the pair don't like each other. Joseph is a tough-as-nails judge and seems to be working the opposite side of the law. What's next? Well, a couple huge surprises and, predictably, some sort of peace and understanding between Hank and Joseph.See this film for the acting. It shows that Downey is so much more than a guy who dons super-hero garb. And, it also features an Oscar- winner, Duvall, showing just how easy it all is for such a talented guy. By the way, although you may not notice it, the soundtrack (aside from one song late in the film) is exceptional--one of the best I've heard in some time.",The Judge
1,bkoganbing,Lewis Stone never had these problems,8,19 April 2015,"Robert Duvall's performance as an irascible old man dying of cancer in the title role both got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor and is the highlight of the film. Duvall who is now 84 years old puts a lifetime of learning and experience into this role, a part he literally aged right into.Robert Downey, Jr. plays Duvall's estranged son, a very successful Chicago criminal attorney who gets a call from his brother Vincent D'Onofrio that their mother has just passed on. Right in mid trial he gets a postponement and flies to the small Indiana town where he grew up to be with his brothers and dad.While still in mourning a man is run down by a car identified as Duvall's and he's arrested. Turns out to be a man he gave a break to in his court who came back and pulled a horrible crime. He'll need a good lawyer, but Duvall won't make the obvious choice.There's a whole lot issues separating Duvall and Downey making a gulf as wide as the Pacific Ocean. As he proudly points out Downey commands some big fees in Chicago. My favorite scene in the film is Duvall insisting that local attorney Dax Sheppard be his lawyer. Sheppard is a part time lawyer and a full time antique dealer who got his law degree at a school Valparaiso, Chile, good old Valpo as he calls it. Downey is beside himself at this guy's incompetence.Grace Zabriskie has a short but memorable performance as the mother of the man who was killed. Years of rage and hate come out at Duvall. As Downey points out when you're a town judge like that for 35 years you will make rulings and have a lot of people you ruled against hate you. In fact as we meet Duvall there's a great example of that when he orders this redneck deadbeat to cough up child support by giving title to his brand new truck over to his esteemed wife so she can sell it. In that world that's like ordering castration. You will make enemies with decisions like that. It kind of makes you wonder about all those old Andy Hardy movies where Lewis Stone was beloved by all in Carvel.Downey and Duvall have a special dynamic working in The Judge. Their last scene together is exponentially poignant.A whole lot of family dirt is exposed when the rug is lifted in The Judge. For fans of both Downey and Duvall this is a must.",The Judge
2,SnoopyStyle,overloaded,6,29 June 2015,"Hank Palmer (Robert Downey Jr.) is a highly successful defense attorney for the richest guilty people around. He has an adoring daughter. His absence drove his wife to cheat and they are getting a divorce. His beloved mother just died and he has to go back to Carlinville, Indiana where he couldn't wait to leave in the first place. His brother Glen Palmer (Vincent D'Onofrio) owns the tire store and his younger brother Dale is autistic. He hates his judge father Joseph (Robert Duvall). He's a hard man and everybody calls him Judge. His old girlfriend Sam (Vera Farmiga) is still working at the diner. Hank's talking skills attracts bartender Carla Powell (Leighton Meester). He suspects his father is drinking after 28 years sober. The police suspects that he ran over someone. They charge him for murdering Mark Blackwell who still haunts him as one of his biggest judicial mistake. Judge insists on hiring inexperienced C.P. Kennedy (Dax Shepard) and Dwight Dickham (Billy Bob Thornton) arrives as a special prosecutor.This movie is simply overloaded. I want to like this for Robert Duvall. Robert Downey Jr. is being really hard. They are butting heads like a pair of alpha-male rams. If that's the movie, it could be a good one. Then there are all the rest of it. The comedy is awkward like the suspected accidental incest. Dax Shepard is being Dax Shepard. That's all wrong. Although the brothers have some potential, I rather have a cleaner story without them. Billy Bob Thornton is doing too much with his role. He's not the star. Everything in the movie is dialed a notch too high.",The Judge
3,Hitchcoc,Two Good Characters in Search of an Author,8,17 October 2014,"Robert Downey, Jr. has won his Academy Award. He is a good polished actor. Robert Duvall. Well what can we say. The writers have these two guys to work with. They'd better do well. This is a pretty good drama with the cocksure Downey, the big time lawyer with no scruples whatsoever, going back to his hick town for the funeral of his mother. He attends a trial over which his father, ""The Judge,"" presides. Downey is able to mouth the words of the judge to the defendant in a child support case. Something has happened in the past that has led to the estrangement of these two men. Duvall has continued his trek through life and Downey has used it to embrace the dark side. We find out that the Judge is ill, even though he does to communicate this. He lives with his other two sons. One is played by Vincent D'Onofrio, who has been saddled caring for his father and mother and his little brother, a mentally handicapped man who spends all his time making family movies. One night, a man who was convicted of murdering his girlfriend after the Judge had given him a lenient sentence, is found dead, run over by a hit and run driver, shortly after his release from prison. His blood has been found on the Judge's car. Of course, he resists his son defending him and that's what this is all about. It gets a little maudlin at times and the viewer gets frustrated too. Billy Bob Thornton, playing a fairly normal man, is the prosecutor. He is every bit as committed to his role as Duvall is as a judge. I lowered the rating a bit because the courtroom scenes at the end are too contrived. Characters are allowed to make speeches without objection, when up to that point, everything was contested. Also, things get just a little pat when it comes to the relationship. Downey and D'Onofrio have issues that go beyond this story and that is another thing that must be resolved. It's an entertaining movie. The acting is outstanding, but it is far from perfect.",The Judge
4,Prismark10,Justice for the judge,6,15 January 2015,"The Judge wants to be a heavyweight legal drama mixing family turmoil and ghosts of the pasts in a small Indiana town.Robert Downey Jr who actually is looking like a man approaching his 50s is a hot shot defence lawyer in Chicago. He defends guilty clients and gets them off using chicanery and is paid handsomely for his skills. As he says himself. 'Innocent people cannot afford him.'The film starts very economically. Within a few scenes you find out that Downey is a no nonsense lawyer, wealthy, that he has an estranged wife, he hates his small town roots, has had a rough relationship with his father and even get an idea of what type of person his father is, The Judge of the title.It is a shame then the rest of the film drags like a southern potboiler melodrama even though Indiana is a Midwestern state. Downey has two brothers who he gets along with just fine, one of them being disabled. He obviously loved his mother but you sense that there was friction in the past and the film lays clues that are rather easy to pick up on such as the older brother having a promising baseball career derailed because of injuring his hand in a car wreck. I wonder who might had been driving the car!Then there is the rekindling of a former romance who also happens to have a twenty-something daughter which might be the result of a past dalliance, complicated by the fact he was also canoodling early in the film with this young dazzler!Of course things come to a turn when the Judge is accused of murdering a former convict and Downey takes his case on. Its the courtroom scenes that fail to convince. I will credit the writers to follow an unconventional route with the court plot but surely an experienced Judge will not go to a novice lawyer first to defend him when he has possible the best defence lawyer as a son. Of course the novice is so useless that the Judge would had been better off defending himself even with his increased forgetfulness.The film was too long, even contrived. I just did not buy the murder plot and the Judge's approach to the trial given that he has been a Judge for decades he was acting like a wide eyed defendant hoping justice would ride to his rescue.There are good performances from the main actors who blend well together but the story does not hang well.",The Judge
5,claudio_carvalho,Great Cast and Performances in an Average Family Drama,6,17 January 2015,"In Chicago, the successful and unethical defense attorney Hank Palmer (Robert Downey Jr.) defends scumbags since his only interest is getting money. Hank is divorcing and when his mother dies, his brother Glen (Vincent D'Onofrio) calls him for the funeral and he leaves his daughter with his wife. He travels to his hometown, Carlinville, Indiana, and meets Glen, his estranged father, Judge Joseph Palmer (Robert Duvall) and his slowed brother Dale (Jeremy Strong) that is obsessed for making films. He also meets his former sweetheart Samantha Powell (Vera Farmiga).On the next morning, Hank and his brothers note that their father's car is damaged and Hank goes to the airport to fly back to Chicago. When Hank is in the plane ready to fly, he receives a phone call from Glen telling that their father has been accused of hit and run and the victim is Mark Blackwell, a despicable man that was sentenced by Joseph Palmer after killing a teenager. Hank returns but his father does not have any recollection from the accident. Soon their unresolved issues interfere in Hank's line of defense and the Prosecutor Dwight Dickham (Billy Bob Thornton) wants to see Judge Palmer behind bars to revenge Hank's victory in a trial in the past. Along the judgment, secrets are disclosed. ""The Judge"" is a movie with great cast and performances in an average family drama. The characters and situations are not well developed, such as Hank's wife that vanishes; few information about Glen and Dale; and the problem between the Judge and Hank. The stubborn Judge Joseph Palmer knows the laws probably better than Hank, but he does everything to compromise his testimony. Samantha's daughter vanishes and the writer is coward and does not let Carla be Hank's daughter. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Juiz"" (""The Judge"")",The Judge
6,nogodnomasters,That's not my testimony.,10,9 January 2018,"Hank Palmer (Robert Downey Jr.) is a cocky self-assured attorney who defends rich criminals and he is good at it, i.e. the Tony Stark character shines through. His father is a hard nosed judge in a small Indiana town. He hasn't been home in 20 years because of him. When his mother dies, Hank goes home and must face his father (Robert Duvall) and two brothers (Vincent D'Onofrio, Jeremy Strong). Family friction heats up, but when his father needs an attorney, Hank stays.At this point the past begins to unfold in ways neither we nor Hank expected. The film climaxes when his dad takes the witness stand in his own defense against the wishes of Hank. It is a story about family coming together.This was a remarkable drama, that is constantly developing. It has Oscar worthy performances by Duvall and Downey jr. Fans of ""August Osage County"" should enjoy this feature.Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",The Judge
7,kosmasp,Not easy,8,20 March 2015,"It's not easy to judge or to make the right choice as one. And the past always will get to you, no matter what you do and what you try to forget about it. This family drama is a perfect example of that. Basing everything on two major actors, this is more than solid (gold). The story works and you're invested from the get go. Even if Robert Downeys character might not seem the friendliest or maybe because of that. Because he seems to be able to get away with things.But we do get to see behind that curtain/wall, that his character has made up and his own denial. There is an almost weird love triangle, which might throw some people off, but it's just to make our main character more believable, to show what he became over the years. Every decision will result in some consequences, question is who is the one taking them.... A great drama and movie, highly recommended",The Judge
8,classicsoncall,"""How does it feel knowing everyone you represent is guilty?""",10,12 October 2014,"Some movies you walk out of talking about the story, and with some you talk about the acting. With this one you'll do both. Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall deliver sensational performances as an estranged son of a rigidly conservative father who happens to be a judge and who's arrested for murder as Downey's character returns to his home town upon the death of his mother. Though the murder case and jury trial comprise a good portion of the story in the latter half, it's really the family dynamics that provide the power of the film. Through vivid flashbacks and family movies, the Palmer family history is laid bare with haunting revelations for the viewer to digest and try to comprehend as they relate to Hank Palmer's (Downey) relationship with his father and two brothers (Vincent D'Onofrio and Jeremy Strong). There are side issues involving Hank's crumbling marriage and former home town girlfriend (Vera Farmiga) that take unusual turns, some would consider them unnecessary to the main story, and to traditional movie-goers, might detract from a family oriented movie experience. Overall though, this is a compelling film that doesn't spare one's emotions, and is bound to register a personal feeling or two, so a spare hankie might be wise to take along.",The Judge
9,gavin6942,A Nice Career Topper For Duvall,7,22 February 2015,"Big city lawyer Hank Palmer (Robert Downey Jr.) returns to his childhood home where his father (Robert Duvall), the town's judge, is suspected of murder. Hank sets out to discover the truth and, along the way, reconnects with his estranged family.Robert Downey Jr is not a great actor in the critical sense of the word ""great"". His range is relatively limited. But he is good at the roles he picks: the snarky, cocky guy. Whether it is a Chicago attorney, Batman or Sherlock Holmes, he brings a certain level of fun and humor to his characters. Even here, he is the comic relief to an otherwise emotional film.Duvall is excellent here. Now in his 80s, he likely has few roles left to play and has one heck of a great career. This is among his finest performances, and a very raw one. The judge has an embarrassing moment or two, and it takes a strong actor to allow such a presentation.",The Judge
10,lee_eisenberg,court authority,7,22 June 2015,"On the one hand, ""The Judge"" isn't the greatest courtroom movie ever made. On the other hand, both Robert Duvall and Robert Downey Jr. put on great performances. While it does have kind of a hackneyed plot - a tragedy results in an estranged family member having to reconnect with his loved ones - it was a well done movie. I'd call this Duvall's best role since ""The Apostle"" and Downey's best role since ""Chaplin"". Unfortunately, the rest of the characters aren't that well developed. Maybe the director wanted to keep the emphasis on the main characters.So, while the movie's no masterpiece, I recommend it just for Duvall's and Downey's performances. I don't know how much longer Duvall's going to live, so it's good that he got to have a role like this towards the end.",The Judge
11,jboothmillard,The Judge,5,5 August 2017,"I assumed this film was a courtroom drama, it certainly has that aspect, but it is more a father-son story, and I mainly wanted to see it because it was part of awards season, directed by David Dobkin (Shanghai Knights, Wedding Crashers, The Change-Up). Basically in Chicago, successful and unethical defence attorney Hank Palmer (Robert Downey Jr.) has been estranged from his family for some time, they live in a small town in Indiana, Hank is also getting divorced, due to his wife's infidelity, this will also lead to a custody battle for his young daughter. He receives a call telling him that his mother has died, he flies to his hometown of Carlinville, there he reunites with his older brother Glen (Vincent D'Onofrio), a tire shop owner, and his younger brother Dale (Jeremy Strong), an autistic aspiring filmmaker. Hank stops by the small county courthouse, he quietly enters to observe a case in progress, the judge is Joseph Palmer (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Robert Duvall), Hank's father, they are later reunited properly for the first time in years at the funeral, Joseph treats guests with kindness, but is cold towards his son. The next morning, as he is preparing to leave, Hank notices damage to his father's Cadillac Coupe DeVille, Joseph denies knowing how it happened, but Hank believes his father was drinking and driving, they have a heated, and Hank promises never to return. But after boarding the plane, Hank receives a call from his brother that Joseph is being questioned by police regarding a fatal hit and run, the victim is identified as recently released convicted murderer Mark Blackwell (Mark Kiely). Blackwell had previously been sentenced by Joseph after killing a teenager, his blood is found on the car, Joseph is indicted and prosecutor Dwight Dickham (Billy Bob Thornton) is seeking a conviction for first-degree murder, Hank agrees to defend Joseph. Hank learns that his father was undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, this explains Joseph's inability to remember the accident and provides a potential defence, for diminished capacity (impaired mental functions), but Joseph rejects this defence, it could potentially damage his legacy. During the trial Hank and Joseph try to put aside their bitterness for each other, dating back to Hank as a teenager drinking and driving, causing an injury to Glen to put an end to a potential career in professional baseball, Joseph put Hank in a youth detention centre, and Hank left Carlinville after never hearing from his father following this. Hank reconnects with his former sweetheart Samantha Powell (Vera Farmiga), whom he abandoned at a Metallica concert over twenty years ago, he discovers she has a daughter, Carla (Leighton Meester), born nine months after he left, Hank believes he is the father, although it is later revealed to be Glen. During trial, Hank believes he has established enough reasonable doubt to result in an acquittal for his father, but Joseph sabotages the case, saying that although he has no memory the accident, he probably did kill Blackwell intentionally, he says that he was haunted by Blackwell's case, having seen Hank in Blackwell, wanting to help him like a son, he misread Blackwell and came to see Hank as being like him. Joseph is acquitted for murder, but convicted of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to four years in prison, but he is released in seven months on compassionate parole, due to his cancer becoming terminal. In the end, following his release, Hank and Joseph go fishing together, after acknowledging Hank as the best lawyer he knows, Joseph dies peacefully in the boat, having finally made peace with his father, Hank returns to the courtroom Joseph once reigned over, reminiscing on everything. Also starring Dax Shepard as C.P. Kennedy, Leighton Meester as Carla Powell, Ken Howard as Judge Warren, Emma Tremblay as Lauren Palmer, Balthazar Getty as Deputy Hanson, Sarah Lancaster as Lisa Palmer, David Krumholtz as Mike Kattan, Grace Zabriskie as Mrs. Blackwell and Denis O'Hare as Doc Morris. Having his career revived, following his sobriety issues, being in superhero and comedy movies, Downey Jr. almost manages a real world role as the cynical lawyer, and I can see reasons why Duvall was nominated awards, playing a constantly grouchy but troubled father, the other well-known stars, including Thornton, don't get as much to do. This could have been a really engaging courtroom drama, but it is fumbled by a predictable father- son relationship built on initial hatred turning slowly into respect for each other, the sentimental stuff gets a little bit clunky, but it is certainly an interesting enough story, overall an average drama. Worth watching!",The Judge
12,rmax304823,"I Know Thee Not, Old Man.",6,7 June 2015,"Robert Duvall, a former judge, is an old man accused of deliberately running down and killing someone he dislikes and who dislikes him. His son, Robert Downey Jr., returns to the small Indiana town and takes on his defense. The two don't like each other.It develops that Duvall is suffering from terminal cancer and is on medication that affects his memory. He can't remember whether he ran his enemy down but there seems to be no other explanation for the victim's blood being on the grill of Duvall's car, or for Duvall's behavior that night as observed by a quick-stop surveillance camera.It could be a fascinating and taut courtroom drama but it's not. The courtroom business hardly shows up. Instead, it's chiefly a tale of the successful lawyer, Downey, returning to his home town and adjusting to gaps and befoulments of the relationships he left behind. They include not only his dying father and his two brothers -- one envious, the other a little slow in a viewer-friendly way -- but Vera Farmiga, now playing the mother of a grown woman. (Gulp.) There are romantic scenes in the moonlight, arguments at home, animadversions, recriminations, verbal abuse, altercations, outbursts of long-hidden feelings, hugs, sobs, and -- Zzzzzzz.Instead of a suspenseful trial, we get a family melodrama.A couple of things stand out. One is Robert Duvall's heroic performance in a demanding role that almost conquers the banal resentment in the script. He's a physical wreck. He poops in his pants and on the floor while crawling into the bathroom, and Downey has to get him into the tub and clean him up. A nice unglamorized touch of what it means to be ancient and no longer in control of the physical plant.Another is Billy Bob Thornton is a supporting role as the prosecutor. I think we're all used to seeing him as some kind of hillbilly, those flabby features, sometimes a good guy, sometimes an evil moron, as in ""False Move."" Here, he's a silvery haired, smooth lawyer, in a respectably dark suit and tie, and he does a fine job in the role.Lamentably, three quarters of the film seem to be made up of scenes written by somebody who was desperate to exorcise his own autobiographical demons.",The Judge
13,moonspinner55,Family dynamics more interesting than the criminal case...,6,12 January 2016,"Veteran judge in picture-postcard Indiana town, suffering the loss of his beloved wife, is arrested soon after her funeral for the car-related killing of a local man whom the judge once sentenced to jail; the judge's second eldest of three sons, an immoral, money-hungry big city defense attorney, harbors deep resentment for his father, but stays in town to see the case through. Glossy, slickly-produced melodrama takes a while to click, mainly due to the improbable casting of the three brothers (none of whom look alike) in relation to Robert Duvall as their father (one is apt to wonder if they were adopted). However, the picture improves as it continues, and the dynamics between Duvall and Robert Downey Jr. (one stubborn, the other selfish) are bracing and well-played. The third-act murder trial is (surprisingly) not exploited for cheap legal suspense--it's fairly straight-forward--though the outcome is curiously mild. The final scenes give the central family drama an undercurrent of emotion, but there are no big overtures. It's rare to find a modern film which places its acting over the narrative, however the audience is prepared to be squeezed and, for better or worse, that lump-in-the-throat moment never arrives. **1/2 from ****",The Judge
14,blanche-2,an attorney comes home to defend his father,8,9 February 2016,"A successful attorney for the guilty, Hank Palmer, now living in Chicago, returns to his hometown in ""The Judge,"" from 2014. The film stars Robert Downey, Jr., Robert Duvall, Vincent D'Onofrio, Vera Farmiga, and Billy Bob Thornton.Hank (Downey) comes home to Carlinville, Indiana, for his mother's funeral. He has two brothers: Glen (D'Onofrio) whose hand was hurt in an accident, ruining a promising sports career, his slow brother Dale, and his father, Judge Joseph Palmer (Duvall), from whom he is estranged. He also see his old girlfriend, Samantha Powell (Farmiga).He can barely be in a room with his father, so the next day, he boards a flight back to Chicago when Glen calls to tell him that their father has been accused of a hit and run. The victim is a murderer, Mark Blackwell, who received a surprisingly light sentence from the Judge. Hank leaves the plane and returns home.His father doesn't remember the accident, explaining that he ""lost time,"" which in a fragile mental state, he sometimes does.Hank plans on defending his father, but the situation between them becomes worse and worse. And the prosecutor, Dwight Dickham (Thornton) wants to make sure the Judge goes to prison.This is a story of a dysfunctional family, as if you couldn't guess. It's a story of suppressed rage, blame, feelings of abandonment, and guilt, and some secrets. The scenes between Duvall and Downey are as heartbreaking as they are powerful. Good thing I had a box of tissues handy.The acting is superb. Everyone is a multilayered character - Samantha, who flirts with her ex boyfriend Hank, but never got over the fact that he left for a concert and never returned; the Judge, a once strong man facing the loss of his wife, mind, and bodily functions; Glen, who is stuck in town dealing with his younger brother. Robert Downey, Jr. is charismatic, and his emotions are perfectly on point. Duvall - someone used the word breathtaking. I will, too. This is not just a stereotyped stern father. This is a real person. The two set fire to the screen in their scenes together.I admit I was disappointed for the first hour because I thought this was a courtroom drama, but when I realized what it was, I no longer felt that way. David Dobkin does a beautiful job of directing.I realize there is nothing new under the sun - this is another family of Dueling Dysfunctionals with lots of issues. But it's played (for me, anyway) as if it's a brand new story, a story of the different ways love expresses itself even when there has been devastating hurt.",The Judge
15,Quinoa1984,top-shelf acting and a fairly smart script rise above (or with) conventions,7,4 November 2014,"The Judge comes not too soon after another film, also from Warner brothers, called This is Where I Leave You. Both movies have very similar conventional trappings (or just elements): a divorced man who has family issues has to go back to his small-town family when a parent dies, and there's tension immediately due to things from the past, and of course this all bubbles up over the course of the story. Where the Tropper adaptation tried to mix comedy and drama, to more or less effectiveness, The Judge is a straight-on melodrama but with the sense of humor one might want with Robert Downey Jr in the lead.This isn't a comedy, perhaps of the dark sort, though originally it might have been had Jack Nicholson been involved. With Robert Duvall playing the judge father to Downey's lawyer son, it's mostly serious. But this is a movie with BIG emotions going on in the midst of a murder trial - did Duvall strike a young nasty punk of a redneck down in the wake of his wife's passing - and the actors have to bring it, especially to a screenplay which isn't always subtle about the revelations and plot turns.But this is not to say that director David Dobkin doesn't do some service to showing things as painfully real - and maybe, in a sense then, kind of twistedly funny - like when the judge, with his stage 4 cancer running through him, has an incident in the bathroom. It's a hard scene to watch, and yet there's just a sliver of amusement, and it makes things that could be just sappy or over-dramatic (that is going over the bar for a scene's level) to being... human on a profound level.The murder case scenes in the courtroom, we've seen this stuff before. Hell, Downey Jr had a movie in the 80's, True Believer, where he was the younger lawyer to James Woods. Here, he's a full-blown star by now, and it's a given that he and Duvall command the screen when they come on. And since Downey is in almost every scene he has to play it well, but what's nice is how, in several scenes, he seems so relaxed in a way. Not that he isn't there to play the emotions asked, but he is so spot-on and comfortable with how to play it that it works better than if it had been another actor. Indeed the other players - Farmiga, Donofrio, Thornton - all have to get up to that level as well.Things that keep the film from being what it aspires to, a BIG movie of the fall season that can contend with the likes of Gone Girl and Fury as far as pulse-pounding dramatic movies that aren't simply for teenagers: some odd-quirky things, like the mentally challenged younger brother (he is a sweet presence in the story, it just still seems like a 'hook' of a sort to hang certain moments on, to spell things out for obvious comedic effect), and a sort of sub-plot involving Farmiga (again, similar to something we just saw in 'Leave You') that leads to a revelation that just detracts from the main storyline, which is much more engaging.If you're looking for something that has some strong dramatic bite - there hasn't been a John Grisham adaptation in a while, and this has the feel of his stronger stories, for example - and of course these actors delivering in three-dimensions, the BIG confrontations, the more awkward and yet harrowing moments where voices are kept normal but tension is high, and the few happy beats (near the end a scene on a small boat is really affecting), this is a good choice. The climax is also good too, in the sense of not being unrealistic about what has come before in the trial but still giving the audience something satisfying. It's not great, but the movie has its cake and eats it.",The Judge

Then he has to stay even longer when his dad-judge Robert Duvall-is booked for a crime involving an accident with an ex-con he once put away. So there's some conflict in Downey's life involving some past family troubles as well as his former girlfriend and his possible divorce from his current wife. I found this quite interesting if a little predictable at parts. I thought the R rating would be for language but there's not too much of that so it might also be for some of the situations the lead character finds himself in. In summary, The Judge was pretty enjoyable though I stop short at calling it excellent.",The Judge

He is equally matched by a worthy Oscar nominated performance by Robert Duvall who plays his cantankerous father.Not only is this a story of conflict, it deals with human emotions, guilt, ethical behavior, an illegitimate daughter-and wait until you find out who the father is of that child,and revenge-justice style.It is also a story of a brother whose baseball career ended when he was involved in a car accident and the car was driven by Downey.Billy Bob Thornton is quite good as well as a prosecuting attorney.The Downey character delivers as he steps up to the plate to defend his father when the latter is charged with vehicular homicide.",The Judge

Against his dad's wishes, Hank co-defends him in court.During this time Hank would really like to reconnect with his estranged family. Also on his mind is his own divorce proceedings waiting back home. Dysfunction probably actually is the winner in this drama.I have never been so impressed with Downey, Jr. He plays this role with arrogance and ego. But then there is compassion sneaking through his outward demeanor. All I can say about Farmiga is that she is absolutely hot. I enjoyed the sequence of breaking into her own bar. Leighton Meester plays Farmiga's daughter and she is a teasing stunner. I really enjoyed the interaction of the characters. I found so much realness in the story. There is a nice soundtrack that sometimes can really help a movie. This story didn't need much help, but it was nice to hear Fleetwood Mac, Gram Parsons, Willie Nelson, Coldplay and Dwight Yoakam.The supporting cast features: Billy Bob Thornton, Vincent D'Onofrio, Ken Howard, Jeremy Strong and Balthazar Getty.",The Judge

It stars two great actors - Robert Downey,Jr and Robert Duvall,who received multiple nominations including an Oscar - together with solid supporting cast that includes Vera Farmiga,Vincent D'Onofrio,Jeremy Strong,Dax Shepard and Billy Bob Thornton.David Dobkin directed the film.Hank Palmer is a successful attorney from Chicago and has been estranged with his family from Carlinville,Indiana.When his mother died,he returned to attend the funeral services.His father,Judge Joseph Palmer,happens to be the city judge of the small town.When his father drove at night to purchase some items from the grocery,his car was found to have blood of a man killed by a hit- and-run.This led Hank to stay a little longer to defend his father in spite of the estrangement between them and reconnect with the people in his town including his high school sweetheart,Sam.While the movie can be categorized as cliché-ridden and has covered many familiar territories,one would probably overlook it due to the great performances of the cast especially the lead actors.Downey and Duvall just proved that they are wonderful performers and definitely icons in their own generations of actors.Aside from being skillfully acted,it was also wonderfully directed by Dobkin.The story is definitely touching and it will capture the hearts of the viewers especially with the father-son relationship involved in the story.",The Judge

Solid acting buoys this otherwise run-of-the-mill father/son dynamic drama about hot-shot attorney Downey returning home reluctantly for his mother's funeral and his estranged father (Duvall still awesome and crusty) the titular local courtroom purveyor who winds up in hot water for a murder rap. The pedestrian script by Nick Schenk, Bill Dubuque and director David Dobkin (who seems out of his element from the usual comedies he helms) doesn't help the storyline but the fine dynamic between motormouth Downey and erstwhile scold Duvall has chemistry to burn and make up for the flaws (namely a rote-go-nowhere 'romance' with Downey's former flame Farmiga who is wasted here without her usual tang and bite).",The Judge
23,evanston_dad,Preposterous Script Sinks This Bloated Windbag of a Movie,2,25 March 2015,"Ugh, a simply dreadful hodge podge of courtroom thriller and family drama.Good actors like Robert Duvall, Robert Downey, Jr. and Vera Farmiga are asked to do something with a preposterous script that no one could save. Downey, Jr. chews scenery like it's his last day on Earth and delivers a terrible albeit energetic performance. He plays a hotshot attorney who's called back to his home town when his mom dies and ends up getting involved in a murder trial with his estranged father (Duvall) as the defendant. As they spend time together butting heads over the case, they also work out their mutual demons, with their big reconciliation scene actually occurring while Duvall is on the witness stand. Somehow, I just don't think a judge or prosecuting attorney would let the courtroom be used as a venue for the kind of telenovela plot exposition it's used for in this film.There are a hundred other subplots, including a ridiculous one involving Downey, Jr.'s ex-girlfriend and the questionable parentage of her college-age daughter. This entire plot strand could have been excised without changing the movie a whit, except that then we would have been denied the always-welcome presence of Vera Farmiga, even when she's stuck in a role she can't do a thing with. Billy Bob Thornton is on hand as the prosecuting attorney, and of course we have to have back story there too. This is the kind of courtroom film that calls for the prosecuting attorney to literally arch his eyebrows whenever it wants to remind us that he's the bad guy.With all of this overheated hoopla, the film is not surprisingly too long (almost two and a half hours!). My wife and I did have some fun venting our exasperation at how dumb the movie was and guessing at how much dumber it could possibly get. How this film managed to score a 7.5 user rating on IMDb ranks with the Kennedy assassination as one of the world's biggest unsolved mysteries.Grade: D",The Judge
24,Uriah43,Some Deep-Seated Family Dynamics,7,1 September 2016,"""Hank Palmer"" (Robert Downey Jr.) is a highly competent defense attorney who suffers from having grown up in a dysfunctional family. The primary cause of the family turmoil was his father's inability to connect with any of his three sons and his constant criticisms of them. As it so happens, the father ""Joseph Palmer"" (Robert Duvall) is a well-respected judge who is completely devoted to the law. However, when he is involved in a deadly hit-and-run he rejects the assistance of his son even though he knows that he is the key to his acquittal. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film had more than its share of deep-seated family dynamics resulting in some rather heavy drama. And it was the acting that brought everything together as both of the aforementioned actors delivered stellar performances. Having said that, this movie probably won't appeal to everybody but I recommend it to those who might want to watch a film of this type. I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",The Judge
25,ferguson-6,Hooker in a Hot Tub,6,11 October 2014,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's hard to beat a good on screen courtroom drama for tension and conflict. Despite centering around a long time judge accused of manslaughter and being defended by his estranged son, a hotshot defense attorney, this one eschews courtroom action in favor of uncomfortable and explosive family dynamics. And thanks to the acting abilities of Robert Duvall and Robert Downey Jr, that's a good thing.Mr. Downey's Iron Man/Tony Stark character has ingrained in movie goers his motor-mouthed smart-aleck persona that fits very well with the lacking-a-conscience defense attorney who only defends the type of white collar criminals who can afford his unmatched courtroom savvy. When Hank (Downey) returns home for the funeral of his mother, we quickly witness the lack of relationship with his demanding-perfection father (Duvall), and the historical details slow-drip for the next couple of hours.Hank's older brother (Vincent D'Onofrio) was once a promising baseball player whose career was cut short after an automobile accident. Hank's younger brother (Jeremy Strong, who played Lee Harvey Oswald in Parkland) is a mentally handicapped young man attached to his video camera. Hank also (of course) runs into his high school sweetheart (Vera Farmiga) and her daughter (Leighton Meester), as a reminder of what he left behind in his quaint hometown when he chose fortune and big city life.John Grisham has made a career, actually two (books and movies) about lawyers and courtrooms. As you might imagine, director David Dobkin (Wedding Crashers, Fred Claus) doesn't have Grisham's eye and ear for the courtroom, so the script slips into manipulative melodrama during the trial (think Grisham-lite). But the scenes between Duvall and Downey more than make up for the fluffy parts. The kitchen confrontation and the bathroom sequence couldn't be any more different, or any more powerful. One is the exorcism of a parent-child relationship gone bad, and the other is a vivid depiction of old age and disease.This is old-fashioned mainstream movie-making. It's about relationships and family and personality and life choices. There are no explosions or CGI or car chases. Even the key crime isn't shown. It's also not breaking any new ground, and if not for the acting, could be just another TV movie. A perfect example is Vera Farmiga, who brings an edge to a role that otherwise would be superfluous. Same with Hank's brothers. Both roles are severely underwritten, but D'Onofrio and Strong somehow make them work. Billy Bob Thornton brings an element to an otherwise not-believable role as a slick special prosecutor wearing $1000 suits. Even Dax Sheperd plays his comic relief country attorney in an understated (for him) manner.Other support work is provided by Ken Howard as the judge, Emma Trembley (Hank's daughter), Balthazar Getty as the deputy with a grudge, Grace Zabriske as the victim's vengeance seeking mother, David Krumholtz as a District Attorney, and Denis O'Hare as Duvall's doctor.In better hands, the script could have become much sharper and the film much crisper. Prepare for cheese and schmaltz, but it's difficult to imagine more fun than watching Duvall and Downey square off. If you stay for closing credits, you'll hear Willie Nelson wobbly warble through a Coldplay song.",The Judge
26,morrison-dylan-fan,I'll be the judge of that.,6,18 April 2015,"Walking back home a few days ago,I decided to take a look in a local DVD shop,and I was surprised to find the fairly recent DVD release of Robert Downey Jr's newest movie being sold at a surprisingly cheap price,which led to me getting ready to attend court.The plot:Returning home after 20 years to attend his mums funeral, Hank Palmer finds his brothers Glen & Dale to welcome him with open arms,but get completely left out in the cold by his dad Joseph.With currently receiving treatment for terminal cancer,Joseph begins thinking about wanting to leave a legacy behind of being the best judge that the town has ever seen.After attending the funeral,Glenn,Dale and Hank are horrified to get a call from the police,who reveal that their dad has been arrested on suspicion of murder.Originally planning to head back to the big city,Hank decides to put his differences with his dad aside,so that he can act as his lawyer,as the judge faces his day in court.View on the film:For Hank's big city lawyer surroundings,co-writer/(along with Nick Schenk) director David Dobkin and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski give the movie a metallic sheen,which shows that nothing is able to dig deep into Hank.Entering the countryside,Dobkin soaks the film up in a misty glow,which darkens as a storm begins to engulf the family.Running at 140 minutes,the screenplay by Nick Schenk & Dobkin struggles to keep an even pace,with the tense court room scenes being interrupted by the Palmer's fighting with each other.Whilst the family relationship dose offer a good love-hate relationship between Hank & Joseph,the writers are unable to find a strong thread for Glen & Dales sub- plots to become entwined,which along with Hank,Joseph and Glen appearing to be pretty relaxed over their dad getting charged for murder,leads to this film sadly not being a landmark case.",The Judge

The story was written by David Dobkin (who also directs) and Nick Schenk who also wrote the screenplay with Bill Dubuque.Hank Palmer Robert Downey Jr. in one of his very finest roles) is a successful defense attorney for wealthy criminals in Chicago, who is getting a divorce. When his brother calls with the news that their mother has died, Hank returns to his childhood home to attend the funeral. Despite the brittle bond between Hank and his father, 'the Judge' (Robert Duvall, at is finest), Hank must come to his father's aid and defend him in court. Here, Hank discovers the truth behind the case, which binds together the dysfunctional family and uncovers their struggles and secrets. To extend comments further would destroy the well-constructed surprises that raise the film from merely a courtroom drama to one of the most powerful family autopsies on film.Vincent D'Onofrio is the burned-out would be athlete who has settled for remaining in Carlington, Indiana, Jeremy Strong is the other brother who is mentally challenged, Vera Farmiga is radiant as the ex-love of Hank whose daughter (Leighton Meester) is of questionable fatherhood, Billy Bob Thornton is the prosecuting attorney in the trial where Judge is sifting through chemotherapy haze and old rituals as he is being tried for murder, Dennis O'Hare is the Judge's doctor, David Krumholtz is a mouthy lawyer who loathes Hank – those are just a few of the sterling performances that grace this film.

28,SimonJack,Dysfunction on trial has very little entertainment,4,11 January 2019,"The idea for the main plot for ""The Judge"" had possibilities. But this film, with two stories intermixed, winds up a mess. One story is about Hank Palmer, a high-class lawyer from the big city, and his dysfunctional life. The other story is about his dad, Joseph Palmer, who has been a small town judge for most of his life and who is implicated in murder from a hit and run accident. The one thing that links these together is dysfunction - between Hank and his dad.Some minor small stories are intertwined here - in Hank's brothers Glen and Dale. The screenplay is terrible. It has just hints at the split between father and son, and holes leave one wondering more about the accident that ended Glen's baseball career.Hank Palmer is a jerk. He's a self-centered, egocentric, know-it-all attorney. He and his wife are getting a divorce, supposedly because she was unfaithful to him. But he was apparently never home. They have a young daughter, who appears in a couple of sequences. He can't forget, forgive or change himself. And that justifies his infidelity back in his hometown. But, that even involves incest, though Hank doesn't know it at the time.This is all background and filler for the big drama of the courtroom where the judge goes on trial for murder. But the family and Hank's dysfunctions take up much of the film.Robert Duvall received a couple of nominations for his role as Judge Joseph Palmer. Duvall is one of the best actors of the period. But, his late career portrayals are of similar eccentric or different characters. Robert Downey as Hank further solidifies a persona of a snappy character with matter-of-fact dialog and mannerisms. It works for an ""Iron Man"" image, but is a turn off in any serious roles, as here. Billy Bob Thornton's Dwight Dickham has a nice hair-do or toupee, but otherwise is forgettable.The best characters in this film are Hank's brothers, played by Vincent D'Onofrio and Jeremy Strong. Vera Farmiga is good as Samantha Powell. There's just not much entertaining about this film.",The Judge
29,siderite,Great acting on a somewhat cliché story,8,15 November 2014,"The film was moving and well done, maybe a bit over dramatic, but then it's a drama, so there. The acting was great, as expected from Duvall and Downey, but the formula of the film is something that you have seen before: estranged offspring comes back to his backwater home due to some death or sickness in the family and then emotional stuff happens, usually involving some hard headed old relative. They usually use good actors for this kind of stuff, too.So I am a bit conflicted, since the movie has moved me a little, but it also bothered me through its lack of originality. Then again, things are not cliché for nothing, its because they happen everywhere. So let's call it a unoriginal well represented statistically well made drama.If you like this kind of stuff, do watch it. It has little to do with the justice system though and maybe something that bothered me was how misleading the trailer for the film was.",The Judge

Hank sets out to discover the truth and, along the way, reconnects with his estranged family.'The Judge', which is Written by Nick Schenk & Bill Dubuque, is predictable & even stretched beyond a point. But, the conflict between its protagonists, the father & son, keeps you hooked as they fight it out verbally. Also, the subtle emotional connect between the two, melts your heart. Even the sequences in the court-room, are nice. David Dobkin's Direction is impressive. Janusz Kamiński's Cinematography is fabulous. Mark Livolsi's Editing isn't sharp enough. The film easily could've been trimmed by at least 20-minutes. Thomas Newman's Score is beautiful.Performance-Wise: Robert Duvall & Robert Downey Jr. are simply brilliant. Duvall, as the stern father & honest judge, delivers a riveting performance, proving once again that he's among the best we've ever had. Downey Jr., as the estranged son & sly lawyer, is sensational. He hasn't been this good in years. Its the on-screen chemistry between these two giants which makes 'The Judge' a memorable experience. Among Others, Vera Farmiga is restrained. Vincent D'Onofrio is solid. Billy Bob Thornton leaves a mark, in a role, that hardly lasts 15-minutes.On the whole, 'The Judge' certainly weighs more in pluses than minuses. And that's pretty good.

31,StevePulaski,A successful film in the regard it's sure to please its audience,7,13 October 2014,"""The Judge"" is one of those films that with decidedly lesser and less passionate talent could've been a more evident hot mess than it already is. In its current form, however, it's a rare hot mess that succeeds mostly because of the audacity and chemistry of its performers, on top of the entertaining content it provides us, despite its lengthy runtime (one-hundred and thirty-seven minutes minus credits).The film concerns Hank Palmer (Robert Downey, Jr.), an immensely successful, arrogant Chicago lawyer, who returns to his hometown of Carlinville, Indiana for his mother's funeral, leaving behind an unsatisfied wife who wants out of their marriage and a young daughter who knows a bit too much for her age. Upon returning to Carlinville, Hank reconnects with his two siblings and realizes all the reasons him and his father, Judge Joseph Palmer (Robert Duvall), have severed all ties to each other. Hank detests his father for not just his stubborn and sometimes vague natures, but his crooked sensibilities that often come off as brash and inhuman.Hank realizes he'll have to extend his stay in Carlinville when his father is suspected of murdering a man he sent to prison some years ago. After a long, emotional night at his wife's funeral, Joseph wakes up to find his car scratched with blood in the front-grill that matches the blood of the victim he hit, who was riding on the street on a bicycle. After being granted the ability by Joseph, Hank now has to go about defending his father, as he is up against the equally-renowned prosecutor Dwight Dickham (Billy Bob Thornton).I cannot proceed further into analysis until I recognize the beauty of Downey, Jr. and Duvall's chemistry and their individual performances. Both actors convey such a natural feeling of stubbornness and gusto that, when both men are in the room together, often occupied by tense arguing or bickering, ""The Judge"" electrifies the audience. Downey, Jr., even as he nears fifty, occupies the sensibilities and the mindset of a cocky frat boy in the best possible way, and Duvall, in his early-eighties, finds commendable energy in his role as the judge-turned-convict. When put together and given personalities that the men can convey in their sleep (Downey Jr.'s cocky, holier-than- thou attitude and Duvall's all-knowing attitude but occasionally vague intentions), the film explodes on screen.Then there's the man who is likely going to get little praise, due to his minimal involvement until the final act of the film, Billy Bob Thornton, doing the best Billy Bob Thornton performance possible. You know the type: confident, but not foolishly cocky, well-spoken, with a humble southern drawl, and groomed but mannered method to his madness. Right off the bat, we have three incredible talents gracing the screen at one time, which almost makes us forget how average and often cluttered the story really is.""The Judge"" suffers from the classic issue of having too many subplots. In my plot summation, I mentioned two (the divorce and the murder trial), yet that doesn't even scratch the film's surface of how many bases it attempts to hit. Aside from trying to play up the ""father never loved me"" storyline, ""The Judge"" attempts to build so much around the life of Hank that it can't keep up. We have a divorce, the rekindling of an old relationship, a possible deadbeat dad situation, a vague future, and that's not even considering the subplots and other features plaguing the other characters, like Joseph and his other two sons. There is simply too much occurring in ""The Judge"" to effectively appreciate everything it has to offer.Then there's the fact that the courtroom scenes of the film, unlike in ""Flight,"" back in 2012, which proved not to be something they were ostracized as prior to the film's release, which find themselves too lost in the affinity of theatricalities rather than realism. By this point, the whole film has taken a realistic, human focus to its story, and to see ""The Judge"" take on brazen obviousness in the way of courtroom shouting and disobedience finds ways to be offputting at times.Nonetheless, ""The Judge"" is, above all, an audience's film, meaning that most people who go to see this film will, in turn, love it, and find themselves reflecting on life, their family, and themselves. I'd be lying if I said this film didn't hit personal chords, depicting a troubled relationship between father-and-son that I have encountered in life countless times, with attitudes and stances greatly mirroring my own reality. For this reason, among the fact that the film's performances are truly something to take in and the film's human interest never loses sight despite a heavy dependence on storyline, I'm recommending ""The Judge"" to people as a solid piece of adult drama with a modern, human focus; we hardly ever get those anymore by someone who's name isn't Alexander Payne.",The Judge
32,DKosty123,Not you typical Court Room Drama,8,11 October 2014,"This movie starts very slowly -almost like an old man driving on a freeway. Then it picks up into a dramatic pace that tells the story well. An Oscar for Robert Duvall as his performance even outshines Robert Downey Jr. The trial is only a piece of this one.The focus is the Judge who has just lost his wife, and has a hidden illness that his family only finds out about after she is gone. The entire cast is excellent though Duvall's performance and the focus on two characters make people like Billy Bob Thornton and the rest of the cast kind of fade in and out of the story, though their support is done well and welcome. The way the script is written, this is a good thing. The R Rating is strictly for language more than anything else despite some good looking and acting women hanging around.Duvall is a strict judge who it turns out is even stricter with his family. He has been sitting on the bench for 40 years and is stricken with the return of his second son Downey Jr) after his mom's death.He sent away that son for being too wild during his youth. He went on to be a really good Defense Lawyer, top in his class. Now he gets dragged into defending his dad after a terrible accident or is it an accident? The script is not quite clear on this.I do have a challenge for anyone who sees this one- The Judge is portrayed as the all knowing elder in this. The drama between Duvall and the other cast members is great, so powerful that after I left the movie I thought of this- What is it the Judge does not realize or know at the end of the story about his family? I challenge anyone who sees this movie to figure out the answer.",The Judge
33,Hellmant,Growing pretty tired of Downey Jr.'s same old comedic shtick!,6,24 October 2014,"'THE JUDGE': Three Stars (Out of Five)Courtroom drama film about a successful Chicago lawyer who returns home to Carlinville Indiana (a fictional town), where he grew up, when he finds out his mother died. He ends up having to defend his father, a judge there, against fatal hit-and-run charges. It stars Robert Downey Jr., Robert Duvall, Vera Framiga, Vincent D'Onofrio, Jeremy Strong, Dax Shepard, Leighton Meester and Billy Bob Thornton. It was directed by David Dobkin (who is most well known for directing hit comedy flicks like 'WEDDING CRASHERS', 'SHANGHAI KNIGHTS' and 'FRED CLAUSE') and written by Dobkin, Nick Schenk and Bill Dubuque. The film is emotional, at times, and well acted but it's also pretty uninvolving and extremely uroriginal.Downey Jr. plays Hank Palmer; a wealthy Chicago defense attorney. Hank recently found out that his wife (Sarah Lancaster) cheated on him, so he's currently going through the process of a divorce. This is hard on their young daughter, Lauren (Emma Tremblay), and even harder on Hank. When he finds out his mother died he goes home, to Carlinville Indiana, for the funeral. He stays with his two brothers (D'Onofrio and Strong) and their father, Joseph Palmer (Duvall), in the house he grew up in; despite the fact that Hank resents his dad. He plans to return home shortly after the funeral but decides to stay; when Joseph (the local judge in Carlinville) is accused of killing a recently paroled man (that Joseph sentenced 20 years earlier) in a hit-and-run case. Hank reluctantly ends up defending his father in court. The movie sounds a lot more intense and entertaining than it actually is. It goes through all the usual motions, of a powerful courtroom drama flick, but never that convincingly. The end is involving, I'll give it that, and Downey Jr. and Duvall are both really good in their dramatic scenes. I'm growing pretty tired of Downey Jr.'s same old comedic shtick though; he's the same character in every movie now (and he's a much better actor than that). The supporting cast doesn't have a lot to do and the directing is barely adequate. It's also too long, at least 21 minutes so (at it's 2 hours and 21 minutes running length), and often quite dull. The film has moments though, mostly in the third act, and it's kind of worth seeing just for them. I think three stars, out of five, is more than fair.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/ON8Zn42-940",The Judge

35,Robert_duder,A nearly perfectly crafted drama/comedy that was simply excellent,8,12 September 2014,"This year's premier film for me at the Toronto International Film Festival was The Judge. It was really the only film I happened to be able to get tickets to an afternoon matinée for. I assumed with the cast that it had that it would be at least decent. Well, it wasn't just decent. It was very nearly superb. It wasn't perfect and once I stopped and started to dissect it a little I saw some flaws in it but initially I was prepared to give this film a solid 9 and I'm still thinking about it. This was a truly great drama-comedy for adults that I think almost everyone will enjoy. The professional critics seem to be giving it a resounding ""meh."" That doesn't surprise me. They don't care for anything that doesn't fit their narrow minded view of what ""art"" is. Sorry reviewers...but its true. The Judge was as good, in fact in many ways better, than last years critical darling ""August: Osage County."" However, they are right when most of them say this is a vehicle for Robert Downey Jr. to do what he does best. The man has incredible chemistry on screen and fans of his will absolutely love this because he's being Tony Stark only a lawyer and this has a little more depth and heart than your average Marvel flick.Robert Downey Jr. is a brilliant, smart talking, sarcastic big city lawyer. The predictability and cookie-cutter character that he portrays is one of the reasons why I hold back giving this a 9. We have seen this type of character before but Downey Jr. is still great at it and he's likable and passionate and he enjoys what he does on screen and you enjoy watching him. He delivers sarcasm and dark humour on point and leads the cast flawlessly. Robert Duvall is breath taking. I have always loved him as an actor but this should be an Oscar nomination for him. It won't because its too mainstream for the critics but Duvall is captivating as the bull-headed, moralistic, small town judge who has been estranged from his son (Downey Jr.) for many years. Together they are beyond dynamite. Their relationship drives this film right into your heart and is mesmerizing. In the way that Streep and Roberts won you over in August: Osage County, Downey and Duvall will bowl you over. Most of the supporting cast are excellent and some are okay at best. Vincent D'Onofrio, Jeremy Strong, Dax Shepherd, and Billy Bob Thorton are all really great. D'Onofrio shows signs of being amazing but due to such a big cast and so much focus being on Downey and Duvall, he sort of gets buried but he is still vital to the film. Some say that Strong as the mildly autistic son is unnecessary but I thought he added a certain dab of heart and sweetness to the film though they do use him for a lot of laughs. Thorton is intense as the prosecutor and Shepherd is very good as the small town lawyer at Downey's side. Unnecessary and almost forced characters were Vera Farmiga and Leighton Meester as mother and daughter. I know every film needs a romance story but it felt like it got in the way and should have been cut from the final film.The Judge is long. Does a drama-comedy that is mostly a mainstream Robert Downey Jr. vehicle need to be 2 1/2 hours...no definitely not. Did I mind? Nope not in the least. I was just starting to think they might be drawing it out just a tad when it ended and it ended well. It told a story, it took its time establishing characters and background of this family, it touched on a hint of a mystery and disease and death and love and despair and redemption and I laughed a lot and I cried a lot and I just really enjoyed it. I felt good after I saw this and I can't wait to watch it again. That to me is the mark of a great film. It entertained me, it was smart and well written with a great cast and great performances. I felt like director David Dobkin who is synonymous with comedy really put his heart and soul into the project and cared a lot about it. He still put a lot of heartfelt laughs in it and it has its drawbacks but it was still really well done.

36,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Tries to cram a lot of eggs in to one basket, but still a highly worthy effort",9,24 September 2015,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Big shot lawyer Hank Palmer (Robert Downey Jr.) is a morally Defence Attorney, whose methods are winding up everyone around him. Then, out of the blue, he gets a call, telling him the devastating news his mother has died. Returning to his home town for the funeral, he is reunited with his elderly judge father Joseph (Robert Duvall), with whom he last parted on very bad terms, and the feelings haven't simmered. But things take a dramatic turn when Joseph is arrested for being behind a hit and run incident, in which a young man has died. But this young man was no stranger to Joseph, and a devastating personal history elevates the accusation to murder. Hank must invest all his notorious ability and cocky wit to save his father from ending his days in jail.In a day and age when the average cinema-goer, roughly in the 18 to 25 age bracket, has the attention span of a hyperactive fly, David Dobkin's The Judge is the kind of film that wouldn't enjoy the kind of acclaim it may have thirty or forty years ago. An original screenplay, rather than being adapted from any novel, it's lengthy duration encompasses a peculiar combination of genres, at times uncertain of it's position as a fractured family drama, a tense courtroom thriller, and even with a noticeable spark of light hearted comedy running through it as well. Regardless of it's uncertain tone, it's still a highly commendable effort, a slow, considered, mature thriller that has a long story to tell and takes it's time to let it develop and unfold, unlike other films these days.When a film has Downey Jr. in the lead role, you can be guaranteed of a pretty none conventional lead performance whatever it entails, but it helps if the role requires it, and somehow in this role, his magnetic, zany persona adds it a weight and clarity, elevating it to something it probably wouldn't have been in another actor's hands. Duvall, also, is an inspired piece of casting, and lends his dramatic chops in his co starring role, and creates perfect chemistry with Downey Jr. That's not to mention a supporting cast including Vera Farmiga and Billy Bob Thornton.I imagine it probably didn't do amazingly well at the box office, but this is the kind of work that works best on a quiet Sunday night, the kind of thing to keep you glued to a screen rather than being dragged out to the pics. It might be trying to do a little too much, but it's still a superior piece of film-making you don't see so much of these days. ****",The Judge
37,dromasca,justice and family,7,19 October 2014,"The Judge is a rather classical combination of family drama and court drama, enjoying a couple of fine actors in lead roles that will land them some place in or close to the area of the Academy Awards candidacies. It's solid but rather conventional cinematography, and as I understand the first output of a new production enterprise where Robert Downey Jr. is placing some of the money earned by the best-paid actor in Hollywood today. As a capitalist Mr. Downey Jr. seems to like conservative, low risk investment.Hank Palmer (Downey) is a successful and filthy lawyer who helps people rich enough to pay him to get away in the American courts of law even if they are obviously guilty. When his mother dies he returns for what should be a one or two days unwanted family reunion in the mid-west city of birth too small for his ambitions. As much as he dislikes the trip he is also rather disliked by a quite non-functional family run by a tyrannical father (Robert Duvall) who is also the judge practically running the place, a man admired by half of the town (the good one?) and hated by the other half (the bad one?). When his father is accused of murder Hank will find himself defending him for once with truth and justice as goals, while all the past he was running of for the last two decades risks to overwhelm him.The relation between father and son is enhanced by the intense acting of Downey Jr. and Duvall which may both compete for the Academy Awards a few months from now. Director David Dobkin seems to have previously dealt with comedies only, The Judge being his first exploration of a 'serious' thematic. He make a few mistakes on the road - the film is too long, and the treatment of the subject too heavy and conventional to my taste. It's not bad cinema, it is just so expected. I hope that better contenders will show up on the road to the Awards between now and February 22, 2015, the date of the ceremony at the Dolby Theater in Hollywood, LA.",The Judge
38,lesleyharris30,"Struggles to be Compelling with Inspired Performances, falls flat with Poor Storytelling,",7,23 December 2015,"The Judge is a good movie with a reasonably well written storyline and a very talented cast. It's a nice film that mainly focuses on the relationship between a grown man and his father, both played brilliantly by Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall, they were both inspired to play these characters and it is shown every second they are on screen. However, it's a very flawed film that had much bigger potential than what it delivered, I found the storytelling to be poor, it jumps around far too often and we aren't entirely sure what the plot of this movie really is until about an hour in, it never becomes any bit compelling, I never felt sucked in to the story. Another weak aspect of the film is that it simply felt insignificant, I couldn't really see why we were following these characters, learning about their relationships, there was nothing that was necessarily unique about them, we've all had issues with family and work before, there was nothing that made them stand out, maybe if they had been more developed I would have felt a reason to follow them. It may be jam packed with flaws, but the Judge still stands strong with powerful performances, it's worth the watch if you ever see it on television or Netflix and are looking for a good drama, but don't go out of your way to see it. A lawyer in a big city returns to his home town to reconnect with his family, but soon learns that his father is suspected of murder. Best Performance: Robert Duvall",The Judge

It looked very predictable, very familiar, formulaic and structural. But at the end it kinda surprised me. It didn't show something special or groundbreaking, but it did work to me.The two lead performances by Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall are very good, especially by Robert Duvall. He got his Oscar nomination this year for a best supporting role, and he absolutely deserves it - very good performance here, absolutely fillable for this movie.

42,sol-,Judgment Day,6,29 September 2017,"Having grown up hating his father, an arrogant lawyer gradually finds it in his heart to defend his father, a respected judge, when he is accused of murder in this courtroom drama starring Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall. The film made Oscar history when Duvall became the oldest Supporting Actor nominee for his role here, and he is every bit as good as that as he battles aggressive cancer and chemotherapy side effects while standing accused. Duvall has a particularly strong scene in which Downey helps him in the shower and the two of them bond over pretending (for the sake of Downey's daughter) that everything is fine with the old man. His stance that he would ""rather die in prison that be remembered as that"" resonates too. And yet, while there is much to like in how Downey and Duvall gradually patch up their differences, there is little escaping the fact that they are pretty obnoxious characters on their own (Downey intentionally urinates on another man's leg in the opening scene), which in turn makes the experience a little hard to sit through when it turns sappy and sentimental towards the end. The film is also bloated with a couple of subplots that could be trimmed (the old flame in particular), and yet, 'The Judge' is surprisingly riveting despite its massive length. Duvall is really that compelling and any music score by Thomas Newman always helps.",The Judge
43,eddie_baggins,Well made drama is missing a certain spark,6,19 February 2015,"When the Academy Awards go ahead on the weekend and beam across the world to countless movie fans, they'll be barely noticing The Judge's 1 solitary Oscar nomination, a nomination for the always watchable Robert Duvall in a role that is baited perfectly for the token older statesmen nomination that occurs seemingly every year. This one lonesome nomination for a film that many talked up as a major contender mid-year is the perfect summation for a film that promised so much, yet delivered so little.Filmed beautifully yet unquestionably without flair, acted well but by actors we've all seen be better, directed in a workmanlike yet without a beating pulse fashion by previous comedy developer David Dobkin and written often smartly yet frequently with a sense of coldness by Nick Schenk and Bill Dubuque, The Judge does so many things right yet so many things equally so-so. The Judge is a film tailor made to feature cliché after cliché and not once do you not know where things are headed and for a film bordering on 140 minutes the various plot strands and side turns culminate in a film that has a lot to say without ever developing them to their fullest extent which is a real shame considering the pedigree and story potential on offer.With a cast of experienced, professional performers at his disposal, Dobkin really struggles to get much out of his troops, even Duvall despite the Oscar nomination is slightly off the boil in a role that at times can become downright embarrassing for the poor old guy. Downey Jr. in another take on his Tony Stark persona really needs to take a step back from his fast talking, wiser than all rich guy roles that have seen him become almost a self-parody of the performances that saw him back to the A-List. Downey Jr. and Duvall share some nice moments together whether they are bickering or enjoying each other's company, but as solo turns there is nothing much to ride home about. It's hard to pinpoint how such a varied cast (which includes Vera Farmiga, Vincent D'Onofrio and Billy Bob Thornton), a decent story set up and a pedigree production could produce such good but disappointingly average final product.The Judge perhaps needed a wiser head to adjudicate it's makings, Dobkin seemingly struggling with his newly found dramatic mojo, as it's not hard to see why The Judge became such a non-event upon release that has seen it disappear from memory, awards shows and critics minds mere months after it was a golden child of the hype train. As someone said to me, ""I can see The Judge being played on mid-day TV in a few years' time"" which is a verdict that perfectly sums up the crimes of a film that could have been so much more had it mastered anyone of its countless ambitions.

The truth is that you don't see how the real story is revealed, until the movie it's finally over and you have time to think it over. The main, superficial story is that Hank returns home for his mother's funeral and end ups defending his father in court. But, apart from that, there is an other story that slowly emerges, the story of the relationship between Hank and his father, Hank's past, his ex girlfriend and his currant family stage. Except from the excellent technique in the story presentation, the movie also has great performances, especially by Robert Downey Jr. The little kid was a good surprise also. However, there are some parts of the film that bothered me. The ending it was too obvious, but maybe it couldn't be other way.

The best of the film is the story, a family drama that holds our attention from the beginning because the characters were so well developed psychologically that they end up touching us. Robert Downey Jr. and veteran Robert Duvall give life to son and father, respectively, and both are huge in their performances, being very good how they interact with each other in front of the camera. But neither are sympathetic characters. They are very similar, cranky and a little stern, and because they are very similar, they have difficulty living together.

46,leonblackwood,Could have been so much better! 6/10,6,8 March 2015,"Review: I'm a big fan of Robert Downey Jr. so my expectations for this movie were really high but I found it quite boring. It really didn't have to be over 2 hours long! Anyway, it's about a hot shot lawyer (Downey) who returns home after the death of his mother. When the funeral is over, he attempts to go back home because of his troubled relationship with his father but he ends up returning because his father has a car accident which killed someone. His dad (Duvall), who is the towns judge, is having chemotherapy due to cancer so he's suffering from memory lose and bad moods swings which is why he can't remember if he ran over the man who got killed. When the police see the damage on his car, he becomes the main culprit for the murder so his son helps to defend him in court. The movie seemed to drag after a while because it's mainly based around the relationship between Downey and Duvall. I was hoping for a deep court drama, like a Few Good Men but it's an emotional drama which doesn't really have that much going on. The performances from the actors were great and I love Downeys infectious screen charisma, but the problem is the storyline which is extremely slow and basic. The courtroom scenes weren't that dramatic but Duvall really does show some true emotion, especially when he's being sick in the bathroom. Anyway, it's worth a watch just to see these actors bring true drama to there characters but I personally was hoping for more from the storyline. Watchable!Round-Up: Downey is hot property in Hollywood at the moment and he's loved by audiences and his fellow actors. He has come full circle after his crack addiction problems and he's looking pretty good at the age of 50. Duvall is still pulling out great performances at the age of 84 and it's hard to remember him in the early years in movies like the Godfather and Apocalypse Now. In this film, the chemistry between the 2 characters was great and very realistic. When the scary looking Billy Bob Thornton goes against them in court I honestly thought that there was going to be fireworks but the director didn't take advantage of the opportunity. Maybe that's why it didn't blow up at the box office but at least it made it's money back.Budget: $50million Worldwide Gross: $84millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their deep dramas about a hot shot lawyer who returns home to bury his mum and ends up defending his dad in court after he causes a fatal car accident. 6/10",The Judge

Each case is always so unique and in an industry that is in desperate need of every scrap of originality it can muster that's a very good thing. In 'The Judge' the court case is really more of a framing devise than what the movie is entirely about, but it's still very interesting. Robert Duvall has always been known as a very fine actor, in fact he's widely considered one of the best in the business. He's been nominated for an Academy Award in a Supporting Role for his performance here and while he has no chance of upsetting J.K Simmons for his role in 'Whiplash' it is still very deserving. It's a gritty performance and he does an amazing job of taking what could easily have been a very unlikeable character and making the audience really feel for him and relate. His scenes with Robert Downey Jr. are very well acted especially and have a tremendous amount of chemistry.The only thing really holding the film back is a lack of memorable scenes. The movie as a whole works very well but it all comes across a bit ""by the book"" and never offers up anything game changing or uniquely profound. Aside from that and possibly running about 20 minutes longer than it needed to (we probably didn't need to see every step of Downey's journey to Indiana in such length) it really is hard to fault. It's genuinely touching and every character is given a fantastic and unique arc that is never overbearing but always interesting.

The events are realistic, the characters are solid and well elaborated, and the plots contains multiple twists, paving the way for logical, yet inevitable solution.But the main gem is the cast - strong and even; although Robert Duvall as Judge Joseph Palmer gives the finest performance (and he was 82 years old already when the filming began!), all the others are also well equal to the task: Robert Downey, Jr. as Henry ""Hank"" Palmer, Vera Farmiga as Samantha ""Sam"" Powell, Vincent D'Onofrio as Glen Palmer, Billy Bob Thornton as Dwight Dickham - what a bunch of great actors who would shine in every movie, irrespective of the topic or era.

52,meeza,"My judging of ""The Judge""",8,21 December 2014,"Before I provide my final verdict for ""The Judge"", I must confess that I did not think Director David Dobkin had it in him to direct a serious drama. Dobkin is known for directing such comedies as ""Wedding Crashers"" and ""The Change Up""; while they are fun flicks, they are not exactly challenging to the cerebral cortex.""The Judge"" is not perfect, it does have some monotonous scenes that should have been sentenced back to the editing room. But nevertheless, Dobkin did hold court pretty moderately in his orchestration of ""The Judge"". The movie stars Robert Downey Jr. as Chicago hotshot lawyer Hank Palmer. Hank goes back to his small hometown in Indiana for his mother's funeral. Hank's father is the town judge, Joseph Palmer; portrayed by the great Robert Duvall. Hank and Joseph have had a rocky relationship for years. When unexpectedly Joseph is arrested for murder, Hank decides to represent him even though daddy judge objects to that at first. Vincent D'Onorfio plays Hank's family-man brother Glen, and Jeremy Strong plays Hank's youngest brother Dale who has brain damage due to an accident that happened years ago with Hank being behind the wheel. The lovely Vera Farmiga also joins in the jury of supporting acting here portraying Hank's high school sweetheart Samantha. Billy Bob Thornton also makes a showing as the hard-knock prosecuting attorney Dwight Dickham, whose hard edge ways pretty much make him the first syllable of the character's last name. The muscle behind ""The Judge"" is most definitely the outstanding supporting performance from Robert Duvall, and the solid leading work from Robert Downey Jr. ""The Judge"" is guilty of a very few filmmaking flaws, but in no way would I object for anyone to view ""The Judge"", and let you judge it for yourself**** Good",The Judge

But he is fantastic in this film, he has the charisma that you expect but also nails the true drama in his character and its refreshing to see. Robert duvall plays his father in the film and he is phenomenal in this film. He is a stern character but you feel the true pain in his character and his chemistry with Downey is great. Vincent donofrio plays downeys brother and he was also great in the film and he really sold the drama between him and downey. Billy bob Thornton is the lawyer against Downey and he is really good in the film too even though I felt he was underutilized. The story had some of the best family drama that I have seen in any film for a while and it was the big strength of the film. However, I felt that there were some wasted plot points such as downeys romance and his father daughter troubles. The script had some fantastic dramatic dialogue that really helped the power scenes. The problem is that the film also tried some humour in the film and none of it worked at all which hurt the film. The style is also a bit of a mixed bag.

55,estebangonzalez10,"Enjoyable when it centers on the family dynamics, but fails as a courthouse thriller",6,20 October 2014,"""My father is a lot of unpleasant things, but murderer is not one of them.""The Judge may not be the highly effective powerhouse courtroom drama we were expecting when we first heard about the pairing of Robert Downey Jr and Robert Duvall, but it isn't the terrible film some critics are describing it as either. Most of us had high expectations for The Judge but once the first reviews started coming in my expectations were lowered so I went into this with moderate expectations. It is a somewhat effective melodrama when it centers on the father and son family dynamics, but when it tries to include other subplots like the courtroom drama scenes and the relationship with a former lover, the film falls flat and feels overlong. Director David Dobbin succeeds when he gets Robert Downey Jr and Robert Duvall in a room together. Those are the most effective scenes of the film and they standout because both actors are on the top of their game. Dobbin however fails when he tries to cram other dramatic elements into this film, and he does so way too often. At 144 minutes, The Judge could have been more effective if it were cut short and centered exclusively on the family dynamics rather than on the rest of the subplots that Dobbin is cramming into the film. The problem is that Dobbin is trying too hard to make a serious film since this is his first time directing a non-comedy. Audiences who were expecting a Grisham style courtroom drama will be disappointed because that aspect of the story falls flat, but as a film centering on a dysfunctional father and son relationship it succeeds thanks to the two lead actors. When the two Roberts get together The Judge pulls at your heart strings effectively, but the rest of the scenes do feel clichéd and manipulative (especially the scenes involving those home movie projections). I also enjoyed this as a character study of the different family dynamics and I appreciated the films intentions about giving an honest portrayal of aging through Duvall's character. There are some powerful scenes, but they are ruined sometimes by the clichés the film follows.Aside from Robert Downey Jr and Robert Duvall's powerful performances (they are both at their best here), there is also a very interesting supporting performances from Vincent D'Onofrio. His scenes with Downey are relevant as well and he holds his own. Billy Bob Thornton doesn't really get much character development considering the court case is simply included as an excuse to keep this family together. Farming is a wonderful actress and she gives a strong performance as well, but her scenes really don't add anything to the film and their subplot could have been left out. The premise of the film isn't anything we haven't seen before either. The story centers on a hot shot lawyer from a big city who is returning to the small town he grew up and ran away from, for his mother's funeral. He doesn't want to stay long because his relationship with his father is a disaster and we get a glimpse of it early on. Those scenes are powerful but not entirely original. Downey plays the smart mouth witty son to perfection, while Duvall is the uptight and stern father who he can easily play in his sleep. The only moment where Duvall and Downey were on screen together that didn't work for me was when they begin discussing their personal issues while his father stands on trial. That was just one example of a forced moment where melodrama seemed more important than authenticity. There are several moments like this that hurt this film, but the few authentic moments are powerful enough to recommend this it. The Judge isn't a bad film, it's just one that had the potential to be so much more.",The Judge

Downey Jr. plays the big city, fast-talking lawyer with the quick wit and Duvall, his father, the small-town judge with squeaky clean morals. Son comes back home for mother's funeral and as the story unfolds around father's recent car accident, who big city lawyer son ends up defending him, their relationship and buried emotions begin to surface.

But as time passed, he made a greater and greater impression on me as a fine actor; especially in Chaplin, for which I thought he deserved the Academy Award. Since then, he has maintained a very high level of performance. This film features a strong all-star cast including a nice, understated performance by Billy Bob Thornton, and another fine performance from veteran, Robert Duval. Vincent Donofrio is always very good as well, but it appears he has been packing away those doughnuts he used to try and hide in Full Metal Jacket. The distaff members perform admirably, but this is mostly an actor's film. The script is tight and the production values are first-rate. Highly recommended.",The Judge

61,aharmas,Downey's Golden Moment,10,19 October 2014,"Robert Downey has given us good acting plenty of times. He gave ""Ironman"" his sarcastic soul. He found the desperation in the teens of ""Less Than Zero"", the sadness inside ""Chaplin"" and we can go through at least half of his films and find that they work because he's truly a remarkable character actor. Who would have thought he needed something a little conventional to shine? Maybe it was because this is the kind of genre that has been cheapened for a while as we are treated to a hybrid that combines the slasher film/mystery with a touch of legal seasoning.This film's heart is the law and its effects on the lives of those who believe in it. ""The Judge"" is the story of two people, their relationship, and how it grows from something pure to something that has decayed over the years, poisoning whatever love and beauty it had before. It has some contrived moments, but they never overpower the basic story like like the gimmicks of the recent ""This is Where I Leave"" which succumbs to overacting and vulgarity. It has more in common with Grisham's thrillers, without the intrigue. ""The Judge"" has a more personal focus, and it works out beautifully.Downey plays a successful and ruthless attorney who specializes in defending the guilty. He will work for those who can afford his services and couldn't care less whether they are innocent or not. It is as if he thrives on showing how good he is at thrashing the opposition, bragging how good he is at what he does, and he's never happy because the one compliment he wants is not to be gained so easily.One day he's forced to return to his hometown and face the demons in his past, particularly that father he seems to hate. He only refers to him as ""The Judge"", and Duvall is icily effective in the way he approaches his sons. He seems to have only love for his recently deceased wife, so we know he has a heart, but why is he so distant and hard on his sons?As the story unfolds, we find out why the father/son relationship is so strained. It's got roots on a couple of tragic development which force both father and soon to react out of disappointment which ironically originates in misunderstanding what is best for each other. Downey quickly begins to get closer to his father, and we see how these two had the stronger st bond in the family, and they get closer as it becomes obvious that time is of the essence here.Enters the legal drama, and Downey has to defend his father in a jury trial to prove his innocence. Things are not easy because the truth might never be revealed. ""The Judge"" is after all now sitting in the accused's chair, and his testimony is affected by circumstances that prove to be key to the eventual resolution of the case.Throughout the film, Downey does nothing short of spectacular while he is acting. His range has never been more effectively displayed. There is anger, love, happiness, sadness, misery, disappointment, resolve, determination, shock, and just about everything we have seen in great character performances. I couldn't help thinking about Vivien Leigh's work in ""Gone With the Wind"", as she evolves from the spirited teen into a mature woman who fails to realize the truth until it's too late. I was looking at an actor joining the likes of Streep's magnificent turns, Bale's intense embodiment of a character, leaving nothing untouched, with no hesitation to show the raw sentiments that torture him.This might be his performance that puts him on the company of Day Lewis' ""Lincoln"", Leigh's ""Blanche"", Peck's ""Atticus"", Streep's ""Sophie"", and some of those iconic roles and performances. In the end we see him contemplating his future by looking at one of this father's office objects, and we realize that we have gone full circle, and that he's about to become what he always feared but he really wanted.",The Judge
62,peterp-450-298716,Brilliant performances ...,7,6 February 2015,"""The law is the only thing capable of making people equal"" Hank Palmer(Robert Downey Jr.) is a shrewd and successful lawyer with a smooth tongue. A chatterbox that overwhelms you with its arguments and you can't get in a word edge-ways. He uses arguments and counter-arguments in such a natural way, as if he's ordering something to eat at a sandwich bar. Therefore for some he's an insufferable person who does not mince his words. My favorite scene is the confrontation with some drunk local figures in a local bar where he and his two brothers Glen (Vincent D'Onofrio) and Dale (Jeremy Strong) chat about lost times. The way he gives those windbags tit for tat and knows how to silence them,is a perfect representation of who the person Hank Palmer is. This piece reminded me a bit of Matt Damon in ""Good Will Hunting"" who puts a group of university students in their place. Slyly I enjoy those moments. I know, schadenfreude is not a nice virtue.Because of family circumstances, Hank must return to his hometown which he turned his back on years ago. The funeral of his mother confronts him with his past. There are his brother Glen, who once stood at the beginning of a promising career as a professional baseball player, and his other mentally handicapped younger brother Dale, who has a passion for filming and usually carries a camera to capture all kinds of scenes. And then there's his father Joseph Palmer (Robert Duvall) who's invariably called ""Judge"" by everyone. A bitter man who can look back at an impressive career as a judge in the town of Carlinville and who's more concerned with his legacy as a righteous judge than his current miserable situation. The next day after the three brothers went on a night out, Mark Blackwell is found dead and his blood is found on the grill of Judge's car. Hank's father can't remember anything and pleads not guilty. Were it not, that years ago he made the error to give this Mark Blackwell a light imprisonment who after being released drowned a 16-year-old girl, there probably still would be some doubt. But this fact does give Judge a decisive motive for murder with hit and run.""The Judge"" is not a typical courtroom drama as we've seen frequently. It's a subtle made family drama with the legal dispute as a side issue and the emphasis on the family joust. Unresolved resentment and mistakes made in the past, played an important role. The whole is explained in detail in a brilliant and subtle way and time has been taken to outline the whole family situation, based on conversations and fragments filmed by Dale. And despite the significant playing time of 140 minutes, you won't get the feeling that you have to drag yourself through it. An intriguing and fascinating family sketch that sometimes tends to become melodramatic (culminating in the confrontation in the basement during a suddenly emerging tornado).It was to be expected that the confrontation between Downey Jr. and Duvall would guarantee some acting from the top shelf. A brilliant performance by Duvall as the stubborn paterfamilias, who nevertheless expresses some human feelings as his granddaughter comes to visit (incidentally also an admirable role played by Emma Tremblay). Downey can be arrogant. He demonstrated this already in ""Iron Man"". The difference is that this bugged me in ""Iron Man"", whereas it fits perfectly here. And definitely worth mentioning are the two emotional (and sometimes funny) renditions of D'Onofrio and Strong. Vera Farmiga (""The Conjuring""), as the ex-girlfriend of Hank, we see trotting along and merely serves as a distraction of the clash of arms between the two Palmer-clan members.""The Judge"" is a pleasure to watch when it comes to the acting, but ultimately it's still just a typical family drama with a court case as a side topic. For the rest, it's crammed with every imaginable emotive subject such as death, illness and an unwavering feud. The priority is the father-son relationship with some story-lines wrapped around it. Ultimately these stories have nothing to do with the core of the matter and only serve to incorporate frequent used clichés so it's guaranteed you'll use a handkerchief to wipe away a tear.More reviews here : http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be",The Judge
63,AudioFileZ,"Father's Stern Discipline, Finally, Rights Son",7,30 December 2014,"Exploring his past isn't easy for Hank Palmer, a high-powered Windy City lawyer who has carved his niche defending wealthy criminal types. You could say, ""somebody's gotta do it"" and you'd be right. What isn't quite right is the life Hank turned to in order to become the crack criminal defense lawyer he is. The Judge is all about personal introspection of roads taken with a tally sheet heavy on loss. The kind of soul searching that can come not entirely by choice, but by fate. Whoever Hank Palmer has become is about to snap into a focus, one he simply didn't set out to ponder. As this is a slice of life story there are quite a few layers soon to be peeled back. Because things like this often begin to unfold due to pivotal events the event here is attending Hank's mothers funeral and the ensuing uneasy reunion with the father he chose to forget.Robert Downey Jr. is one of those amazing actors who can do that ridiculous superhero comic book stuff brilliantly, but give him a tragically tortured soul in a very real,i.e not ridiculous, situations and he rises above all. This role is quite a contrast to the bombast of Tony Stark and even with some of the swagger of Stark hovering this is a much more nuanced presentation. Downey's troubled journey and renaissance in real life, likely, have forged an excellent performance here. Now, this isn't to say this yarn isn't puffed up with all the clichés' such as old girlfriends, confrontations with testosterone and beer enhanced red necksbut, The Judge has it's heart in a place where this is just a little garish color around a much better picture that is slowly painted. Robert Duvall as Judge Palmer is the field from which the fruits of Hank Palmer spring forth. Duvall, the consulate actor he is, delivers the character of Judge Palmer to perfection. Even in anger Judge Palmer never comes off as anything but poignant.This movie delivers with heart and soul. The cast couldn't be better, the cinematography is as beautifully framed as a Normal Rockwell Saturday Evening Post cover. The story itself, well it's never more sensational than real which is to say it works on a very humanistic level. The Judge humbly weaves it's magic by not overreaching and succeeds by just showing a family's triumphs and tragedies that ring true.",The Judge
64,jadepietro,The Verdict is In,5,4 February 2015,"Rating: ☆☆ This film is not recommended.There is a scene in The Judge where the two characters, a father and son, walk in different directions from each other. That serves as a heavy-handed metaphor for their stormy relationship (and that's not even counting a real storm later in this film either). That moment sums up this overstuffed film whose many subplots go in all sorts of different directions.The filmmaker, David Dobkin, is addled with a weak screenplay that can't seem to make up its mind whether it wants to be a courtroom drama or a family melodrama about a dysfunctional Midwest clan.The main plot of the film seems to be a) a slick city lawyer named Hank (Robert Downey) returns home to an ailing and distant father, Judge Joseph Palmer (Robert Duvall) who b) may have killed a man during a hit and run accident. Those two stories never gel. Add to that, c) a romantic entanglement with a former girl left behind with a past secret, d) an unhappy brother who never amounted to much, d) a low-functioning younger brother who is obsessed with his camera and e) another ambitious lawyer out to win his case against Hank's father. Neither do all this other plot points come together well.What does work is the fine acting by the Roberts. Downey takes on a serious acting role, a nice change of pace from his action hero work, and reminds moviegoers how skillful an actor he can be. Of course, playing opposite an acting legend like Mr. DuVall does up the game. Duvall reprises his Great Santini character as the dominating father figure, but he excels in his quieter scenes as a man coming to terms with his own morality. Although the film cannot stay clear of clichés, their scenes together still resonate with tension.The other actors are left with underdeveloped characters to play. Vincent D'Onofrio, Vera Farmiga, Jeremy Strong, Dax Shepard, and Billy Bob Thornton bring their A game to their film roles.The problem with The Judge is its troublesome screenplay by Nick Schenk and Bill Dubuque that constantly rambles from one subplot to the next and never builds to a satisfying conclusion. The family drama is predictable fare and the courtroom case is fairly predictable also. David Dobkin's direction keeps everything moving but with nowhere to actually go. So what we are left with is a well acted film in search of a better script.I rule that less would have been more in the case of The Judge.

65,Seraphion,A good break from seeing Robert Downey Jr. as a superhero,6,24 October 2014,"Facing a divorce, a great yet not so honest city lawyer Hank goes back to his home town in Indiana to attend his mother's funeral. He meets his father Joseph, an honest judge of the town who have always been an opposition to his ways and opinions. After leaving with anger over an argument about the divorce, Hank returns again as his brother tells him his father is charged with manslaughter with his car. The victim is a Mark Blackwell whom Joseph tried once. Hank easily sets his father out of interrogation but further investigation really makes Joseph a suspect. For the preliminary hearing, Joseph chooses his lawyer, an honest but seemingly incompetent man to defend him, whom Hank repeatedly harass over which. The case goes on to trial and the lawyer stepped down admitting his lack of experience. Being formal, Hank offers his father a 'contract' on Hank being his counsel. Yet there are still instances where Joseph insists on using honest ways, contradicting Hank's cunning ways of the loopholes. Hank's own investigations find that Joseph is undergoing a medication that can cause some degree of memory loss. Hank's daughter comes from Chicago for a weekend. Contrary to Hank's thoughts, she relates smoothly with Joseph. When she goes back home, Hank gets hints that her manners look like his ex-girlfriend's daughter Carla, thus he suspects that Carla is his kid. Things go on at the trial. Hank manages to prove that it's hard to see the road of the crime scene, but the prosecutor work on Joseph's pride making him convince his feelings that though he can't remember hitting him, he's glad that the victim's dead. Hank pulls out his last trick, bringing out the medication and memory loss. This angered Joseph and he requests to change counsels. But the presiding judge demands Joseph to complete his testimony first with Hank. Asked why did Joseph gave a lenient sentence to Blackwell all those years ago, Joseph reveals the truth that he saw Hank in Blackwell and Blackwell in Mark interchangeably. This grew his mercy to give Blackwell a new chance, and grew his strictness to Hank so that Hank doesn't grow to be like Blackwell. The jury verdicts Joseph as not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, and the presiding judge sentences him to four years in prison. Joseph gets out on parole seven months later and Hank picks him up. They go fishing on a lake and Joseph admit Hank's talent as a lawyer and dies there.The story overall is interesting enough. It combines many diverse drama subjects in one movie; from father-son relationship, childhood nostalgia, cunning lawyer job, and a 'nursing home' story element. Being billed as only a drama genre, the law case is nicely presented as mysterious at the beginning. Also the comedic inserts are also nice.One thing I don't really get though is that those many things have some great deal of focus that the whole movie doesn't really have one main focus. The title says to focus on the law case, but the presence of Samantha's and Lauren's points of the story kind of pulls back the focus from the case and stretches the drama into a big span. This is also not yet mentioning the potential story at Dickham's side.I like how the story depicts Hank's character. Being as hard as his dad Joseph, he again and again abandons him yet again and again returns to his side even swallowing in the rejections from Joseph. Unfortunately this adequate character building doesn't cover the rest of the characters presented. The movie only presents one or two traits for any other character and strangely keeps focusing on those traits. It makes the other characters look like robots or something.The acting parts is a good overall for me. The two Roberts nicely put down their acting on those heated arguments and father-son moments. Downey Jr. still retains his fast talking skill nicely. Except for those father-son moments, he still really looks like a Tony Stark or Sherlock Holmes in character to me, though. Robert Duvall very nicely portrays the old stubborn geezer who once was someone. Dax Shepard nicely adds to the comedic aspect. The other cast members make the story more alive well enough.For me, The Judge (2014) deserves a 6 out of 10 score. It's quite a nice entertainment, a drama with added mystery and comedic aspects. If only story has more stable and narrowed down focus, I think it can be better. One thing for sure though, It's a good break from seeing Robert Downey Jr. as a superhero.",The Judge
66,Movie-ManDan,"Despite A Reasonably High Rating, The Judge is Still Underrated.",10,15 February 2015,"The Judge stars Robert Downey Jr and Robert Duvall. Need I say more? The extraordinary gifted and talented Roberts lead an all-star cast that includes Billy Bob Thornton, Vera Farmiga, and Vincent D'Onofrio, and Dax Shepard. I will agree with most haters that the courtroom portion is a bit weak and and Downey Jr is too Tony Starky, but who cares? I would honestly say the only flaw is that it is too long. This could easily have been less than two hours.Downey Jr plays hotshot lawyer from Chicago named Hank Palmer who returns to his suburban Indiana hometown for his mother's funeral and must contend with the town and family he left years ago. I like this early portion because it shows very beautiful shots of the sun beating down on nature and rivers that make it very nice to see. We also get a good look at who these characters are. Downey Jr's comeback role of Tony Stark has made him star as all-too similar characters since Iron Man's release, so his role as Hank Palmer does lots of wisecracks. His father, Judge Joseph (Duvall) as been accused of murdering a young man he hates and Hank jumps to represent him. Hank bears a slim chance of his father being let off due to apparent evidence and telltale signs. Hank and Joseph rebuild their lives together and rekindle their relationship as father and son. Joseph's physical and mental health is deteriorating and it is sad to see what is happening with him. I wouldn't call it melodrama, just great acting. When it gets to the courtroom portion, yeah it's not complex or as good as To Kill A Mockingbird or 12 Angry Men, but who cares? The plot and characters have been firmly established and deeply examined to make the court part great. Take the courtroom part by itself and it's weak, but you can't have one without the other. The courtroom portion is not to be informative about the law or to centre the movie on, it is there to help our two stars grow and be closer than they've ever been.This is the perfect father-son movie to watch. Downey Jr and Duvall are captivating in this wonderful film.3.5/4",The Judge
67,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Judge,7,14 October 2014,"Taking place in Southern Indiana (you can tell because the landscape is full of foothills) and directed by a guy who is known chiefly for making comedies, The Judge is a long yet briskly paced courtroom drama. The overall plot concerns a hot shot Chicago lawyer who must defend his own father (a longtime judge presiding in a small town via the Hoosier state) against a stone cold murder charge. This mean-spirited, resentful (you could throw in spiteful too) lawyer flies into town initially to go to his mother's funeral. He ends up staying longer than needed when his father's dim-witted counsel can't handle the intensity of the case, a case involving a death by hit-and-run. Robert Downey Jr. plays the big city attorney (Henry ""Hank"" Palmer) while the legendary Robert Duvall plays his tough as nails, not to mention bullheaded judge father (Joseph Palmer).As an originally conceived film with a title that averts to something John Grisham would approve of, The Judge didn't really remind me of any other dramas except for its mild sentiment towards certain clichés. You know, the aspects of a rich, well-off lad who comes back to his small hometown after he abandons his family and leaves behind the high school sweetheart that he once loved. And oh yeah, you can also throw in the cranky old timer who wasn't a good father and may or may not be a recovering alcoholic (a la 1982's The Verdict). No matter though. In essence, this is an absorbing, chaotic, messy, yet powerfully realized downer of a movie. It's depressing in its dysfunctional family dynamic and its ending is clearly anti-Hollywood (really not what you'd except). However, there is never a dull moment and at roughly two hours and twenty plus minutes, there's a lot of movie in this movie. You get what you paid for and then some.The acting is top drawer, all down the line. Downey Jr. and Duvall have only been in the same flick one other time (1998's The Gingerbread Man) and clearly don't look related. But they work well together. Their performances in the lead roles hit you like a ton of bricks. Watching them spar in scene after gut wrenching scene, you feel as if they were actually bear and cub in real life. It's truly intense. And I gotta admit, Robert Downey Jr.'s ""Hank"" was tough to put up with for the majority of the running time. There's a lot of pent up anger there. There's also lots of moodiness, regret, and narcissism going on. Downey Jr. with his fast talking mannerisms and blatant Tony Starkness (you know, his character from Iron Man), looks like he's going to a bad place with this character. You feel like he could just explode at any minute. His performance is no doubt brilliant but gee-whiz, he could have possibly lightened up a bit. As for the rest of cast, they are solid especially Billy Bob Thornton exuding a sort of menacing cool. He plays the prosecutor in Duvall's character's case who is bent on justice (and the prospect of issuing a murder one charge to boot). Finally, we have Vera Farmiga effectively channeling the token, long lost love interest and Vincent D'Onofrio riffing off his The Break Up role by playing ""Hank's"" otherwise nervous older brother (Glen Palmer). Oh and by the way, did I mention the hard R language these characters carry off with totally relentless aplomb? This ain't no People's Court. This is indeed 12 Angry Men (and you can maybe count some woman too).In conclusion, The Judge is pretty meaty entertainment despite a few hiccups along the way. I mean I could have done without a couple of scenes involving projectile vomiting and the sight of runny poop coming out of an 80 plus year old man (note to director David Dobkin: you're not making The Change-Up here. You're making a full-fledged, human drama). Also, I couldn't figure out why Downey Jr.'s ""Hank"" stayed at his father's storage room (at the Harper family home) during the opening funeral. I mean initially they hated each other, right? So I'm thinking that ""Hank"" could have at least found a hotel room (even in the small, fictitious hick town of Carlinville, Indiana). Regardless, this early fall release gets a recommendation from me. If you decide to take in a viewing, remind yourself that this film is not just a farce about the fate of a dying man through a handful of jurors. Think of what's on screen as a rekindling of fathers and sons by which the characters have extremely strong personalities and for the most part, are just too bad for each other. My final verdict on The Judge: Guilty, as in you're guilty if you don't check it out at a theater near you.",The Judge
68,bob-rutzel-1,"Good, Not Great",7,7 February 2015,"Hank Palmer (Robert Downey Jr) a lawyer and estranged son of Judge Joe Palmer (Robert Duvall) defends his father accused of a hit and run accident that resulted in a death. The movie should have been titled The Son because it is mostly about Hank Palmer and his wayward ways growing up in the Joe Palmer household. Hank's mother has just died and now Hank must deal with his set-in-his-ways father. We hear all the non-compassionate and brash ways the young Hank treated everyone as he climbed the ladder to success. The family is dysfunctional in many ways, but other issues crop up to complicate matters. These back stories about the family are fine, but we kept looking for an edge that would prove The Judge not guilty of the charges. So we kept watch with every conversation that Hank has with friends and family to see if something they said would cast some light into getting a not guilty verdict. At the same time we kept hoping for a bonding between father and son although we knew this was next to impossible. There should have been more tension between father and son and even in the courtroom. I didn't feel that tension. Maybe you will. I kept hoping for a bonding and something that would help the Judge. There should have been tons of tension, and I didn't feel any. I guess, to be honest, I didn't care for either the son or the father the way I should have. Maybe. I just felt something wasn't right (could it have been the dialogues?) Hmmm..No Oscars as the acting all around was good, not great. Supporting cast members: Billy Bob Thornton as the opposing lawyer, Dwight Dickham; Vera Farmiga as Samantha (Hank's high school love); Ken Howard as the Judge in Joe's trial; Vincent D'Onofrio as Glen (Hank's older brother); and Jeremy Strong as Dale (Hank's younger brother) were all very good.To be honest Billy Bob's character as opposing counsel Dwight Dickham was so good I wanted to give him an Oscar. He is that good. He out-shined both Downey Jr and Duvall.I really liked that silver metallic ring that opened up into a drinking glass for Billy Bob Thornton's character Dickham as he displayed it on the table in the courtroom. Hey, I need to get me one of those. The ending was kind of inconclusive and you will have to read into it what you want. I mean there were many threads that started in the beginning and they never came full circle to resolution. So you may have to come up with them yourself. They in themselves are not important, but they were there. I'm just saying. (7/10)Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, some not all that much.",The Judge
69,Sergeant_Tibbs,Misjudged by the filmmakers.,4,8 November 2014,"Movies like The Judge live on a different planet. You only find the dilemmas, dynamics and inner conflicts in saccharine movies like this. It stems from lazy writing, or at least, very unimaginative writing. Its concept is a very do or die one, and it falls flat on its face. It wants us to support a murderer as if what he did was right. This lifetime movie views of morality. There's blasé incest thrown in for good measure. None of The Judge's content sat right with me, it's not offensive, just poor. It reaches to the bottom of textbook clichés and refuses to develop anything, leaving the actors on their own, but it isn't enough for them to chew on. It has a loose theme of legacy that struggles to resonate. Robert Downey Jr. tries his best to impress Robert Duvall and while it's a little appropriate for the character, it comes off as inconsistent characterisation. Duvall phones it in besides a few scenes of shouting. A filler nomination would be a nomination too many. Being way overlong doesn't help.4/10",The Judge
70,krocheav,Miniseries Heads To The Cinema,7,9 June 2016,"The Judge looks visually terrific and certainly has a couple of very good dramatic scenes, but has a script that ends up borrowing from too many other mellow-dramas and soaps. The overall story is initially interesting (if a bit familiar). IE: How many HBO/TV type miniseries have we all seen peopled by characters living flamboyant messed up lives - where every turn of a page, or new character that emerges from the shadows, and each opening of a door releases yet another closeted skeleton?. It all begins to feel like normality could never have existed in its idyllically set country town. The audience is manipulated like paper under the silhouette artists scissors. Technically slick, with complex editing to bamboozle the viewer into not thinking too much about some of the more icky situations.Performances run the gamut, ranging from flamboyant showy turns to reasonably powerful. Talented Robert Downey Jr. in this case, is investing his own money to tell the industry he's back and out of rehab (lets hope he's matured enough to stay out). Then there's Robert Duvall doing what he's now become known for as doing best. It's just a pity the characters are all so nasty or flawed that it's difficult to feel much empathy for them. As for the more interesting characters (and performances) the honors could well lean towards Emmy nominated Vincent D'Onofrio (who was quite unforgettable in his 80sec turn as Orson Wells in Ed Wood)- here he plays Downy's brother Glen. There's also Oscar nominee Billy Bob Thornton as the sophisticated prosecuting attorney (bringing with him yet another mysterious secret). Thomas Newman's music also adds a nice touch. There's enough happening to keep you watching to the end, but just how deeply it may affect you depends on how much leeway you're prepared to give. Note: If needless bad language puts you off keep the ear wax handy.",The Judge
71,Screen_Blitz,"Flawed, but mesmerizing and surprisingly touching drama with strong performances",7,3 August 2015,"Many probably know Robert Downey Jr. for playing the iconic British detective Sherlock Holmes or suiting up as Iron Man in some of Marvel's most beloved film franchises. This time around however, Downey takes on a more dramatic role in this courtroom drama. He plays Hank Palmer, an ambitious defense attorney in Chicago, who returns to his hometown in Indiana when he learns of his mother's death. There he reconnects is with his estranged brothers Glen (played by Vincent D'Onofrio) and Dale (played by Jeremy Strong), but struggles trying to reconcile his relationship with his disgruntled father Joseph Palmer (played by Robert Duvall), the town's judge. When Joseph becomes a prime suspect of a run-and-hit homicide, Hank takes on the role as his defense attorney in court.This movie may not live up to the best it's potential, but I was quite surprised how riveting it was. Robert Downey Jr. put on a great performance as the main character, but it wasn't quite impressive as Robert Duvall's performance as the main character's father who loses his wife, becomes mean-spirited and descends into alcohol addiction. It's no surprise that his performance landed him an Oscar nomination. The story was great, but maybe not as good as the performances. The film tackles serious topics like divorce and dysfunctional relationships. Robert Downey Jr's character and his are going through a divorce and are in battle for custody of their daughter. His character is also estranged by his father and as the film progresses, tensions grow between the two and becomes a major subplot.The film does great as a drama, but as a courtroom drama, I have to say it is a bit weak. There are many times where the film tries to be emotionally manipulative, especially with Thomas Newman's music score. As a result, it makes the subplot with Hank and his father stand out more to the main storyline. At the same time, it also makes the story very touching and mesmerizing. Towards the end, it gets to the point where it grabs at your heart strings and may make you tear up a little bit, I got close to shedding tears. Basically, the emotional atmosphere had both a positive and negative effect on the story.Overall, The Judge is a decent film. Robert Downey Jr and Robert Duvall were amazing in this. Yeah, the film may seem a bit overly sentimental and clichéd at times, but I was satisfied with it. As a courtroom drama however, I think it could use some improvements.",The Judge
72,Troy_Campbell,"Clichéd, overly-sentimental and waaaay too long.",4,14 October 2014,"With its noble intentions and heartfelt effort, it's difficult to be critical of this family relationship drama. Focussing on a stubborn old Judge (Robert Duvall) who is alleged to have killed an ex-convict in a hit and run, and his estranged lawyer son (Robert Downey Jr) who is defending him in a small-town court, all the while trying to reconcile their broken relationship, I wanted to be swept up in it. But for all of the love and hard work poured into this motion picture from the director and his cast, The Judge just has too many drawbacks to look past. The score is manipulative rather than affecting, the cinematography is weirdly ostentatious when it should be subtle and the almost two and a half hour runtime is ludicrously unnecessary. Yet the major issues begin and end with the script. Mawkishly sentimental, over-burdened with clichés it can't transcend and dishing out more clunky dialogue than the high-calibre actors deserve, Nick Schenk and Bill Dubuque's screenplay is not up to scratch for what should've been an Oscar contender. Take nothing away from the cast though, Robert Downey Jr nails his key dramatic scenes (although he relies on his trademark cocky charisma a tad too much in the opening 30 minutes), Robert Duvall is fearless in his portrayal of an aging man losing his faculties, and Vincent D'Onofrio demonstrates why he should be getting more big screen supporting work, with a nuanced take on Downey Jr's older brother who never got to leave town for bigger and better things.

Don't read it unless you have already seen the movie although I strongly suggest that you not watch the movie so there's a bit of a Catch 22 situation here.The recent film The Judge illustrates how bad movies are even when they are trying desperately to be good. They loaded this movie with top talent in the form of Robert Duval and Robert Downey but then they just didn't seem to know when to stop and stacked Hallmark movie of the week clichés until the thing just collapsed under its own weight like the Twin Towers. You could have played cliché bingo and certainly when it is revealed that his high school sweetheart fathered his brother's kid it was time to call a winner.There were so many unbelievable things in the movie. Why did he fly to Indiana if he lives in Chicago? Where would he fly to? His daughter had never seen her grandfather? I can think of anything so horrible that grandpa could have done to deserve being denied access to his granddaughter unless Duvall was diddling young Robert Downey. Had they left out about three of the story lines, one of the brothers, and an hour of film the movie wouldn't have been half bad.There were a couple of good scenes and Downey is completely charming as an actor and one of the very few movie stars I can actually watch.",The Judge

The Judge was close to being a beautiful film with fewer moments to grab your attention.A city lawyer, Hank, returns to his hometown when he learns about his mother's death. He soon realizes his father, who was the judge of the town, is suspected of a murder. Hank takes up the case and investigates the truth behind it.Director of hilarious comedies like Wedding Crashers, Fred Claus and Shanghai Knights, David Dobkin takes up different step to move toward a drama depicting the strong bond between a father and son. The film contains some good humor making the serious drama on the lighter side. However, the second half goes into for a topsy-turvy. The focus shifts from court-room drama to Hank's other relations and breaks the momentum of the film. The editing could have been trimmed by few moment to gain more impact. Despite these short-comings, the screenplay is strong keeping you engaged with soothing background score. Art direction is nice with ecstatic cinematography. Robert Downey Jr will win your heart with award-wining performance. He gets into character of Hank Palmer as if it has been tailor-made for him. He is expressive and will leave you spellbinding with stupendous performance. Robert Duvall was enthralling as usual. The legendary actor lends in a good support and was equally competent.Overall, treat yourself with The Judge. It has good story, class acting and beautiful music. Good 3/5",The Judge
76,areatw,"Good drama, but a bit of a drag",6,13 December 2016,"'The Judge' is a decent enough drama with some very strong acting performances and an interesting plot, but it doesn't do enough to justify the two and a half hour running time. The films goes through lulls where there just isn't enough going on to keep your attention. It seems strange to me that they didn't cut down the scenes of extensive dialogue. A lot of it wasn't really necessary and would have shaved off a good portion of the running time. As it is, the film is too long. The plot doesn't have the depth needed for a two and a half hour film, and whilst the drama and story was nicely done, I would have liked some more intense courtroom scenes. After all, the film centers around 'The Judge'.",The Judge
77,PartialMovieViewer,Outstanding Work,10,8 April 2015,"Well I certainly understand why this movie was not nominated for 'Best Picture.' The writing was excellent; the casting and acting superb; the production and direction – both flawless, and the storyline, brilliantly logical, fathomable and palpable. Additionally, this movie is insultingly coherent to the masses vice being 'so very special' that some elitist caste of the falsely erudite are sole arbiters of the decipherment of hidden meanings – 'how dare they make a good movie - LUVY?' Another reason this production did not swim in the Oscar Pond is an apparent disdain by 'Hollyweirdos' and their lapdog critics toward 'Robert Duvall.' How insulting are those rare entertainers who come equipped with a spine and refuse to chant the Pavlovian locution of the smarmy and mindless. Mr. Downey beware – minus your suits of armor, CGI and starky attitude; you have proved to be a rarity. This movie reaffirms you as one of the best actors out there, resulting in you being a superior talent. Meh! This movie is a very moving portrayal of a troubled family, coming full circle and finally resolving painful issues in the only possible way. Now I must back-peddle a bit and apologize for lumping all 'critics' together...that is rude of me. They are not all the same. Obviously there are many pundits, distant from Tinsel Town influences who write honestly and frankly. I can deal with those who speak from the heart, and are critical of things I like. But it sure seems like there are those 'bots' out there who tend to copy from others – blindly following the pack if you will. For those of you who veer from the head-nodder sycophants, I salute your independence. Granted, this movie may not be the timeless masterpiece of 'To Kill a Mockingbird', I do consider this to be very high quality entertainment. Rarely can I go to a cinema and not feel like I was just shellacked out of too much money by some young scripter's duplicity or a director's experimental camera work. With 'The Judge' you get what you pay for. No misleading advertisement, just a really great story. I am saddened that this flick did not receive more nominations, but what do I know? I do know I would really like to see more movies like this. Highlighting the superb mechanics that brought this work to light clearly screeches near perfection, vice chirping fail.

78,TOMASBBloodhound,"Good acting, but too long and too much manufactured family angst.",6,8 March 2015,"They had it right in terms of casting, anyway. Everyone here seems perfectly cast, even Thornton, who is under-utilized. The performances are rich, and powerful enough to carry this soap opera quite a ways, but ultimately not far enough. Robert Downey Jr. plays a stereotypical hotshot defense attorney who is forced to try to reconcile with his estranged father when dear old dad is accused of manslaughter. Downey's father, played by an increasingly geriatric Robert Duvall, is a no-nonsense small town judge who may or may not have intentionally run down and killed a man with whom he has a troubled history. Did dad do it? And if so, was it intentional? Hard to know, when the old timer's memory is slipping on top of everything else.The trial takes up a good deal of screen time, and this is a good and bad thing. The good thing is it gives us a furlough from the back and forth family angst between Downey, his father, his brothers, his wife, his ex-girlfriend... you name it. Downey has a lot of issues to work out with a lot of people. The tone of this film is relatively serious, and it definitely attempts to tug at your heart strings. Somehow, a lot of this aspect of the film just seems too forced. How many people in real life are so obstinate that they don't speak to their parents for twenty years? Or their brothers? It just isn't believable. Their constant arguments make a long movie seem longer. The bad thing about the trial is that it winds up being pretty anticlimactic. The verdict is predictable, any anyone hoping for a revelation that will exonerate the old timer will be disappointed. Maybe having things all cleared up by an unexpected technicality such as seen in My Cousin Vinny would have made things worse, though. Overall, it just seems like the trial should have had more of a payoff. The film also loses points for a subplot involving Downey possibly making out with a girl who is actually a daughter he never knew about. Logically, it seems like she could be none other than his, but the movie seems to chicken out in that respect. The actual revelation of her father's true identity is pretty hard to believe. There are some good points here, too. Besides the strong acting and casting, the film also makes no bones about the horrors of the advanced stages of cancer. Duvall may never get the chance to put so much of himself into a role ever again. He earned his nomination. Vera Farmiga is also a welcome sight in just about any role. The verdict.... they should have gone for more of a comedic angle. Downey, Duvall,... all of these people could have made it more enjoyable if they just relaxed the film's tone a bit. I don't think Terms of Endearment had so much angst! Watch if you must. 6 of 10 stars. The Hound.",The Judge

80,Anurag-Shetty,A heartwarming courtroom/family drama.,10,16 November 2014,"The Judge is the story of Hank Palmer(Robert Downey Jr.) & his family. Hank is a successful lawyer. After a terrible tragedy occurs in the family, he has to return to his home town. Here, he reunites with his family. His father Joseph Palmer(Robert Duvall), is a reputed judge in the town. Joseph Palmer is accused of murder. Now, it is up to Hank to defend his father in court. The Judge is a brilliant movie. Let me make things clear. The Judge is not just a courtroom drama. While the case is happening in the court, Hank reconnects with his brothers & friends in his home town. The Judge is also about a father-son relationship that has undergone a lot of tension over the years. The movie is about how Hank & Joseph try to rebuild that relationship. The courtroom aspect of the film makes it interesting. However, the family aspect of the film makes it emotionally satisfying. Don't get me wrong. There is a substantial amount of comedic scenes in the movie. The highlight of the film is the performances. Robert Downey Jr. is spectacular as Hank Palmer. Although Downey Jr.'s character is kind of the same old sarcastic jerk he always plays, there are many emotional scenes where Downey Jr. shows us the depth of his acting ability. Robert Duvall is outstanding as Joseph Palmer. Duvall has portrayed Joseph's anger & vulnerability, effortlessly. Vera Farmiga is great as Samantha Powell. Billy Bob Thornton is brilliant as Dwight Dickham. Vincent D'Onofrio is incredible as Glen Palmer. Jeremy Strong is incredible as Dale Palmer. Dax Shepherd, Leighton Meester, Ken Howard, Emma Tremblay, Balthazar Getty & David Krumholtz are awesome as C.P.

81,jrarichards,"Well-acted, fairly authentic-looking tale that makes you think",8,20 February 2016,"Is it better to be a big fish in a small pond, or a small(er) fish in a big one? And does the word ""better"" here mean selfishly better, more lucrative, more likely to ensure full development of talent, or morally more right? And if a person does choose to stay on in a small town, become one of its leading lights, is that not a worthy thing too, but one having the almost-inevitable consequence that the small-town community will eventually bring its one-time idol crashing to the ground? And is that not all the more likely given the sound advice I once received from my own grandfather that: ""no matter what you do, some people aren't going to like you"". And then, how much more relevant do all of these questions become when the son who moves out to the big city is a litigation lawyer and the father who stayed where he was is a judge who sagely and fairly hears whatever cases come before him? These are the key (but by no means the only) questions dealt with in ""The Judge"", where the title role goes to Robert Duvall, and that of the wayward son with whom the dad is constantly at loggerheads to Robert Downey Jr. Since these actors give one a fusion of the cinema experiences one goes to a Robert Duvall or Robert Downey film to see, we are (mostly) off to a good start - at least from the point of view of this reviewer. I write ""mostly"", given that there are a couple of moments of sharper Downey-style ""comedy"" that do not fit the bill in the context of this film - even glaringly so. The most visible of these concerns his make-out session with a far younger, and very good-looking, woman that leaves our hero wondering later (without excessive guilt or distaste, it must be said) if he has actually been ""spending quality time"" with his own daughter. But then everything turns out all right, since it's actually only his niece! Well, this IS a small town, and so presumably such stories will indeed raise their ugly heads, but somehow it's rather at odds with the serious main tone of the film, which yields a number of other more-or-less interesting plot lines regarding ""old flames"", old resentments between brothers (the Downey character has two - nicely and contrastingly played by Vincent D'Onofrio and Jeremy Strong), enmity within a town so cosy that you can't avoid bumping into your sworn enemies as well as your friends, varied memories of a late mother and thoughts about her legacy, terminal disease and yet-several others. Overall, it's a rich enough and real enough tapestry, which only occasionally veers towards cliché - and even then mainly because the kinds of things that happen here really do happen again and again in life. Fathers do feel disappointed with sons, sons do feel held back or left in the shadows by fathers, illness can sometimes change these relationships, brotherly love can be ruined by the stupid behaviour of the moment, and sometimes - just sometimes - a city-slicker can suddenly realise that going back home to a different, ostensibly simpler, life, is actually what he or she most wants to do. Without giving too much more away, it is worth noting the ever-welcome presence of Billy Bob Thornton, whose portrayal of a lawyer dominates some of the courtroom scenes and ensures that we do indeed depart firmly from cliché in this part of the film. So, by the time the final credits on ""The Judge"" roll the viewer can feel that he/she has experienced the few ups and rather frequent, complex and difficult downs that characterise many a family of people who are not basically ""bad"", but just find it beyond their capabilities to live the smooth and happy life that mostly seems confined to fairy-tales. For me, that was and is reason enough to watch and enjoy this well-acted film raising and facing up to a plethora of real-life issues.",The Judge
82,bob-the-movie-man,"Good, but some judicious pruning needed",7,21 October 2014,"Based on the trailer, my anticipation for seeing ""The Judge"" was high – – Robert Downey Jnr, Robert Duvall, Vera Farmiga, Billy Bob Thornton great cast. And whilst the film is still good, it suffered in my view from getting rather bogged down in family melodrama.The film opens with a series of stills of various items, all of which play a key part in the plot as it unfurls. Robert Downey Jnr plays hot-shot Chicago defence lawyer Hank Palmer who has a reputation for getting guilty clients off the rap in return for a big fee. He has a hot house, a hot wife and various hot cars. The death of his mother forces him back to his childhood home in Indiana – a place he has not been since his turbulent teenage years. A key reason for his absence is his father Joseph, the Judge of the title (Robert Duvall), with whom he has something of a difficult relationship. When on the day of the funeral Judge Palmer gets into his own brand of legal trouble, a battle ensues as to whether Hank can overturn his father's stubborn views that he is better represented by the local hick lawyer cum shopkeeper C.P. Kennedy (played extremely well by Dax Sheperd).Surrounding this main story are the various sub-plots involving his relationship with his three brothers, his past high school flame and his hauntingly torrid past within his home town.There is great acting on display here. Veteran actor Robert Duvall in particular is exceptional in the lead role, struggling to balance the conflicting demands of his defence with his reputation within the community. Also on top form, Billy Bob Thornton plays a devastatingly fearsome prosecution lawyer – looking like a hawk, you would hate to be in the witness box when he started on you! Robert Downey Jnr, when he gets his teeth into the meatier scenes, is also exceptional: one scene in particular with Thornton in the police station office is just riveting. However, I felt Downey Jnr sometimes drifted into being (as my son neatly put it) ""a bit Tony Stark-ish in places"": playing out the old disarming comedy schtick works brilliantly in the Iron Man or Sherlock Holmes films, but in this intense drama it sometimes detracted from the character of the film. The ever-reliable, and this time blonde, Vera Farmiga plays Samantha, the high school beauty he left behind who he finds still serving behind the bar of the local diner (although with a nice twist). However her role really isn't fleshed out particularly well and she feels underused in the plot and the film in general.Where the film struggles is in the screenplay which seems to be bogged down with too much 'stuff' that needs to be worked through. The core story, albeit rather formulaic, is good and compelling and doesn't really need all the extra baggage. A more judicious (no pun intended) edit and a reduction in the running time would have helped. The film also seems to try to play a 'fish out of water' card of the hot-shot lawyer in the backwater town, but rather misses the mark. Nice try but no cigar.Another significant criticism for me was in the sound mixing department. This might be my 50+ year old ears, but what with the fast delivery of lines and Duvall's gruff style, a lot of the dialogue didn't successfully make the short journey between ear and brain. And there were some really key lines of dialogue that I missed. If this was on the TV, I would be constantly hitting rewind to catch what was said – unfortunately they don't let you do that in the cinema.Outstanding though was the cinematography (by the great Janusz Kaminski). The film was shot in Massachusetts (principally the town of Shelburne Falls) and it looks beautiful, with clever boom work delivering sweeping and cleverly composed shots of the town. In particular, there is one stunning shot of Downey Jnr driving into town near the start of the film which is just superb. I'm not sure how it was done, but I'm thinking possibly a drone attached to the moving car that was then untethered and flew away? Breathtaking almost worth the ticket price alone! In summary, not a perfect film but one with enough emotion and acting talent on display to be worthy of your multiplex investment.(If you enjoyed this review please sign up for my future reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com.

It would not make him justice to say it delivers because this not just a formulaic movie done well, the factored talent give life to a little something extra that changes everything.Such an harmony is the hardest to attain, putting in line all the elements so that nothing feels out of place.

86,Likes_Ninjas90,"Ultimately, the case presented relies on stale precedents we the jury have previously seen in more convincing fashion",4,8 October 2014,"Does Hollywood do enough to encourage diversity? Robert Downey Jr.'s redemption from troubled drug addict to industry heavyweight overshadows the repetition of his high-energy performance registers. Not that Hollywood would be deeply concerned. This year Forbes ranked him as their Most Powerful Actor and listed tenth on the Celebrity 100 list. Forbes also cited the four Marvel films featuring his character Iron Man earning more than four billion dollars. His success still asks why he cannot diversify his performances and why more couldn't be made of The Judge, which marks a false start for his new production company Team Downey. Downey Jr. is fifty next year, a ripe old age for a superhero, which means he will enter unfamiliar territory by expanding his film choices. He and his wife Susan Downey are both producers on The Judge and their power in Hollywood should have enriched the star-studded casting with stronger talent. The cliché riddled script for example was rewritten twice, with the final version penned by Bill Dubuque, a first- time screenwriter. Similarly, the only memorable work by the film's director David Dobkin has been The Wedding Crashers, which is hilarious but hasn't prepared him to make a courtroom drama. The story of The Judge is homogenised from the outset, with the narrative telegraphing the predictable and old fashioned transformation of a big city Chicago lawyer who learns the value of family over money. Hank Palmer (Downey Jr.) is a hotshot lawyer with little time for his young daughter and whose punch line is: ""Innocent people can't afford me"". After his mother dies, he returns to his Indiana apple-pie hometown to visit his father Joseph (Robert Duvall), an ageing judge who is put on trial for a hit and run case. On the night of the accident, his father might have been back on the drink. Running at 140 minutes, the plot is overstuffed with melodramatic, Sparks-esque problems including: a life-threatening illness, a dysfunctional childhood, a lost love, a potentially estranged daughter, an intimidating lawyer and a family crisis. Not only are there too many elements in the script but they are encapsulated through safe, worn Hollywood staples, like male friendships and retrospective memories, with no new angles of their own. The father and son relationship is contrived because it is shoehorned into the courtroom scenes. Downey must represent his father when the town's nervous lawyer (Parenthood's Dax Shepard) isn't up to the task and as the tension spills into the trial the film's climax ridiculously doubles as a family therapy session.Similar to many mainstream films today, The Judge's adult characters are forced to relieve their childhoods, viewing them ludicrously as the linchpin of the problems in their current lives. While the court case alone could have made a solid 90 minute drama it is interrupted by family scenes infantilising Hank. He has two brothers: Glen (Vincent D'Onofrio), who was set to be a promising baseball player until a car accident injured his hand and Dale (Jeremy Strong), who is slightly challenged but crafty with a video camera. The home movie footage is a cornball excuse to include family footage and show how memories of the past resolve the current day crisis and enhance Hank's parenting skills. Does a person, particularly one well past midlife, become too old to be this sentimental and overly concerned about what happened in their childhood? Another thread further infantilising Hank is when he puts on a Metallica t-shirt and rides a bicycle, which coincides with his reunion with Samantha (Vera Farmiga). She is an old flame, now running a bar, and who has a daughter of her own. A pointless diversion about whether this is also Hank's grown up child, a disastrous thought after he kisses her, would be more suited to a straight comedy vehicle. Ultimately, the case presented relies on stale precedents we the jury have previously seen in more convincing fashion.On paper the cast looks exceptional but turn in serviceable performances. Each person is playing an archetype which does not enable them to fully embody the characters. Downey Jr. is typically charismatic, knowledgeable and confident as Hank but given his speech patterns and line deliveries are derivative of so many of his other characters we're left asking if there is anything more he can do in his sleep. He can still effortless spin one-liners and a few made me laugh, which lightens the film. It is a shame that the talents of Farmiga aren't fully utilised and she could have made a strong fist playing the opposing lawyer, which was given to Billy Bob Thornton who treats the role like he was instructed to be a brooding villain. These are problems typifying the weakness of the film: it feels like we are consciously aware this is a film and a construct because of the script's clichés and the general feel of the movie, where the tone slips away from the director as though he intended to make a broad comedy. No matter what Robert Duvall says, this film is not going to be as big as Apocalypse Now.",The Judge

What you get is a really poignant family portrait that doesn't pull a lot of punches. Let's say, when James L. Brooks was making battery acid family movies.What I think a lot of criticism is based on for this movie, is a sense of drag. If you don't have family dynamics as combustible as the Palmer family, this may not interest you. I never liked ""American Beauty"" because I thought that family was dumb. I discovered, that I just don't relate to it. This family dynamic I do. NOT because I've had knock down drag out fights with my father (quite the opposite actually) but because most of the time, we don't see reason as to parenting. We don't necessarily like to eat our peas. In our mind, there is no reason, in theirs they only see reasons. So what you get is a push and pull. Especially between two stubborn bull-headed adults.

It would be a terrific opportunity to us this argument: ""Objection! Meretricious sentimentality! Objection! Badgering the audience!

It could have been a breath of fresh air to see Downey Jr. leave the Marvel universe and Baker Street behind, and remind us all what a terrific dramatic actor he really is. Alas, we'll have to make do with him as ""Iron Man"" for the time being, as that seems to be the only good role - only really good role - he's landing for now. Even though the film boasts of two stand out performances from Downey Jr. and Duvall, they can do little much to save this hotchpotch of courtroom dramatics and familial dysfunction, neatly wrapped in a conventional package that does whatever it takes to shout IMPORTANT, and, please remember us at Academy Awards time.The only surprise in this long, drawn-out, mushy, clichéd, melodrama is a risqué bit of incest; a refugee from a previous draft, perhaps, that somehow made the screen, possibly at the insistence of Downey Jr, who realized his flick needed a little spice.

93,TheSquiss,Duvall & Downey Jnr's courtroom drama of family feuds. More meat than a Grisham,6,24 October 2014,"The Judge is one of those films they sneak out between the summer blockbusters and the worthy, winter, winning hopefuls; it is too small, too niche to go head to head with the sequels and blockbusters but not quite edgy enough to be a serious contender for gold when we get down to the nitty gritty of the awards season.However, David Dobkin's legal drama is a solid enough flick with plenty to hold the attention and some engaging performances to while away the two hour plus running time. It may not have the tension of courtroom heavyweight A Few Good Men or the gravitas of JFK, but The Judge achieves much as a John-Grisham-with-more-meat production.Hotshot Chicago lawyer, Hank Palmer (Robert Downey Jnr), reluctantly returns to his small town, family home when his mother dies. But whereas he makes decent ripples in the city's legal pond, in the sleepy town of Carlinville, Indiana, it is his estranged, outwardly hostile father, Judge Joseph Palmer (Robert Duvall) who is the big fish. Eager to see the funeral through and leg it back to Chicago post-haste, Hank is forced to stay when the judge is accused of murdering a former defendant with his car. Despite their mutual dislike for each other, Hank must defend the judge and scrape through the muck and bitterness to the truth of the case and their own family secrets.Like August: Osage County, The Judge is a movie about families tolerating and coming to terms with each other's foibles and reluctantly burying the hatchet, ideally not in one anther's backs, against the backdrop of a forced gathering. The courtroom drama serves to spice up the proceedings and is a great MacGuffin, but the detail is in the relationship between father and son.There are no startling revelations that rock us, just a steady evolution of time and patience as both men air grievances and rail against each other's obstinate manner. Duvall and Downey Jnr make for excellent and watchable sparring partners. Both have been here before but not pitted against each other and this is a marvelous display of Hollywood royalty on fine form.The supporting characters are fluff to give context or a change of shape and pace to The Judge. Each subplot reinforces the complication of family life in its various forms and several of them could easily be the central theme (and frequently have been): brothers with a bitterness based on guilt and regret; long-lost girlfriend (Vera Farmiga as Samantha) who still holds a candle for him; philandering stud consumed by career who rediscovers the attraction of the simple things The Judge is almost a patchwork quilt of ideas, but it works. It is an absorbing film of tenderness and honesty that frizzles with the electricity of family feuds and lightens the atmosphere with occasional, stonking one-liners courtesy of scribes Nick Schenk (Gran Torino) and Bill Dubuque.There are one or two blatantly staged moments (could the outcome of the bicycle ride be any more obvious?) and The Judge takes a half step away from reality in the culmination of the final courtroom scene, but that's forgivable given the outcome and aftermath.Dobkin, whose work as director to date hasn't thrown up anything deeper than Wedding Crashers and The Change-Up, has crafted an attention-grabbing film with a cast that does him great credit. I departed the screening buoyed by the experience and feeling fulfilled. A couple of days later the details are hazy (whereas we can all still quote lines from A Few Good Men) but it remains a positive experience that fades pleasantly and is worthy of a second viewing one day.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",The Judge
94,RevRonster,Not perfect but enjoyable...,8,29 January 2015,"I really enjoyed ""The Judge"" but the film isn't without its problems.There's no real surprises going on with the story in this one and the entire film plays out almost exactly like you would expect it. Additionally, the film has some side-stories that aren't that developed and kinda fade away after they get some mild resolution. Finally, a lot of the supporting characters aren't given enough screen time and aren't developed as much as they need to be—and believe me, a lot of these characters seem exceptionally interesting and it's a little heartbreaking to seem them not utilized as well as they should be.However, despite these shortcomings, the film is very charming and, even though it is cliché, the drama and comedy work very well. Finally, you can't ignore how amazing all the performances are in this one. In fact, they are so good that it is easy to ignore any problems this film has and really made it a fun movie that I enjoyed.",The Judge
95,thekingsdom,A tad meh!,5,3 May 2019,"There's some good actors in this who give great performances but the story is packed with too many different family story lines. As others have said, it tried to pack in too much. 5/10 does it for me.",The Judge

Than, everything rapped up perfectly.More formulated than I was expecting I think the story was predictable so the movie has to rely in the acting chops of Duvall and Downey Jr to make the characters compelling enough to care about. And I'll give it an A for the acting. The Two Roberts, Vincent D'Onofrio, Vera Farmiga, & Billy Bob Thornton. It was great watching them interact on the big screen with each other. It was a highlight watching the two Roberts interact as father and son. This was so real and emotional.But I'm not all that impressed with the story as a whole. It got too predictable, and that made it boring. Sorry to say.",The Judge
97,MattBrady099,Court and law with the Robert's.,5,7 November 2014,"Two Roberts in one movie about court and law. Should be interesting. The movie is about a hotshot lawyer returns to his how town after his father, the town judge, is accused of murder. While seeking the truth behind the crime, he also tries to reconnect with his estranged family. Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall both did a excellent performance in this movie. I like they back and forward with each other as they are both fantastic actors, and in this movie there's no different that their talent always shines up on the big screen with glory. The writing in the movie was also good and as I said before about the father and son back and forward dialog was written really well, and I got to give Nick Schenk and Bill Dubuque credit for doing that.Vera Farmiga character in the film for me could have been cut out of the movie, she didn't do a terrible job but her character to me slowed the movie down for me and every time she came on screen the movie starts to drag. The movie may not be for everybody. Most people are going to think this movie is dull or boring, but if you are the kind of person who likes to think deep about movies with character's having a drama's or dealing with problems about family or friends then the Judge is your movie. The Judge has two fantastic and brilliant performance be the main Robert's.

98,MovieHoliks,First-rate Family Legal Drama,8,15 June 2015,"I usually like films like this- legal dramas that are more character- based, and this one delivers! Robert Downey, Jr. stars as a big city lawyer who returns to his small home town to attend his mother's funeral, but then gets involved in his father's (Oscar winner Robert Duvall) criminal murder trial. *possible SPOILER* His dad is the town's big deal judge who has put away many a criminal over the years, and he apparently has run down someone he let free years ago in a drunk driving incident. Did he do it on purpose??- or was it just a drunken accident?? Downey's character meets up with his brothers (including Vincent D'Onofrio) and an old flame (Vera Farmiga), as well as has to sorta coach the inept lawyer handling his father's case toward the beginning- played with amusement by Dax Shepard. Yes, you have a whole list of clichés here, but when they work they work- especially when you have the right case ensembled together. Billy Bob Thornton plays the prosecuting attorney, and he is good as usual, just maybe a tad under-used in the film-?? But the best thing about this film is at it's heart it's a father/son story- Downey and Duvall work well together in a love/hate relationship. Downey blames his dad for not being there most of his life, and Duvall blames his son for some things he may have done that cut short the baseball career of his brother. I would recommend this as good father/son viewing for the upcoming Father's Day holiday weekend...",The Judge

100,ArchonCinemaReviews,"Nothing new to see here folks (good film and liked it, but not THAT superb)",6,15 November 2014,"Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall elevate an average and overdone premise into a heartfelt and engaging film in The Judge.Hank Palmer is a big city lawyer on the west coast, and has a tumultuous and strained relationship with his father, a prominent judge in a tiny town. Alas, he returns to his small hometown in the Midwest when his family needs him and tries to restore his relationship with The Judge.All in all, The Judge is pretty unremarkable and quite cliché. Troubled son of a controlling father follows in said father's footsteps in an attempt to prove himself and his worth. Son returns home due to tragedy after long separation and while home old wounds open up, clarity in perspective is attained and contact repaired.The story conceived by Nick Schenk and David Dobkin is far from original and frankly has been done to death. Dobkin further directs the feature film written by Schenk and Bill Dubuque. The cinematography in The Judge is clear, direct but literal and uninspired.It is thanks to Paul Schnee and Kerry Barden that The Judge excels in any notable fashion. The casting of the film is remarkably stellar, enlisting a whose-who of talented actors within their craft. Robert Downey Jr. plays the arrogant city lawyer with a delinquent past. Robert Duvall is the domineering father but well respected pillar of the small community. Even the supporting roles are sublime, with Vera Farmiga, Vincent D'Onofrio, Billy Bob Thornton, Dax Shephard, Jeremy Strong and Leighton Meester round out the cast.The leads are so perfectly cast that the casting single-handedly elevates this average drama to a compelling narrative. The beginning of the film is a bit rough but by the end I was engaged and connected with the characters' transformations.For more reviews of recent releases, please check out our website.",The Judge
101,blackmamba99971,Fantastic duo,10,27 October 2014,"For years I have wanted to see Robert Duvall and Robert Downey Jr. play in a movie together. Although I never dreamt it would be about a court case. For many years Downey has impressed me for his versatile acting ability to play any role given to him no matter how ridiculous or serious it would be. The film set in the deep southern town where Duvall plays a stern but fair judge becomes a man on the other side of the bench.Downey plays his estranged son who comes back for his mother's funeral but gets stuck for his father's trial seeing as a local man was run down by his car on a rainy night. Emotions gets high when Hank (Downey) tries to help his dad by recalling that night in detail. As memory losses and a failing health condition ensues it starts to call forth doubt as to whether Hank could win his court case at all.I believe this film was excellent because of the high strung characters trying to reconcile differences in light of Hank's father's case even though his father is as guilty as sin. It held aspects of the human condition to where people lose track of themselves in light of what's right or wrong. Duvall played a man of the law to the letter. His performance was brilliant as a man who has nothing to lose for his cancerous condition but for his family it would mean to lose the better part of their lives despite the cost.Seeing a few new roles was a breath of fresh air with Hank (Downey) seducing a local woman who is the daughter of his high school sweetheart Samantha (Vera Farmiga). It had that uncomfortable role where should he tell her what went on between him and Sam's daughter or should he just keep his mouth shut to allow time to pass a bit slower than he would like. For the most part seeing Billy Bob Thornton play a prosecutor is as always wonderful to watch with his linguistic abilities to give a punch line without telling a joke first. His air to play the baddie impresses me even now.For the entire film it was touch and go with emotions, betrayal, reconilitation, heartbreak, and to see Downey play a man who is not afraid to cry. His talents as an actor inspires a great many fans around the world. From his first role to his most recent as a hero who's legacy will live on long after he has left the stage. The judge is an impressive film for court room dramas. I recommend this to all ages above 16.",The Judge

103,lathe-of-heaven,"Extremely well made. Intense, powerful, quality family drama...",7,9 February 2015,"First off, this is not typically my kind of movie. Although I can appreciate how well made it is, I just don't normally gravitate toward intense family drama, which is what primarily makes up this film.So, I rated it with that in mind; not so much that it will ever be one of my favourite films or that I will ever watch it again, BUT, it is indeed extremely well made and brilliantly acted. I mean, I was frigg'n crying in it more times than I would like to admit (well... I didn't ACTUALLY cry because I am so manly...) So, IF that is your kind of film, then you will totally love it. Just, DON'T go into this movie thinking that it is primarily a 'Courtroom Thriller' or even a 'Courtroom Drama' (for an excellent example of that kind of film, I would highly recommend 'THE RAINMAKER'. A LOT of Drama, BUT also some colourful characters and a LOT of legal courtroom intrigue) Not this one... This one is almost completely centered around the family where Robert Duvall is the father and the judge of the title, and Robert Downey Jr. is his hot-shot, big-city lawyer son.So, if you really enjoy quality films with VERY powerful, intense family Drama, then you should really like this movie.",The Judge

105,room102,Recommended,6,9 October 2015,"A criminal lawyer has to defend his estranged Judge father. This is both a courtroom drama and a family drama.Good writing and very good performance by Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall (who, at age 83, got a nod at the Oscars for this role, just as I expected). With Billy Bob Thornton, Vincent D'Onofrio and Vera Farmiga (I didn't even recognize her).David Dobkin, known for silly comedies, goes in a different way and does a very solid job in directing this drama.I should mention that the movie is 140 min long. Score by Thomas Newman, Cinematography by Janusz Kaminski.According to IMDb's trivia, Jack Nicholson was considered for the role of the Judge. Duvall is great in this role, but I can definitely see Nicholson in it - he could have been great in this (Tommy Lee Jones was also considered, but I don't think it would have worked nearly as good as the other two).",The Judge
106,James_De_Bello,7/10,6,25 October 2014,"With so much been-there-done-that situations and a slightly over sentimental approach, it was surprising to be actually absorbed and interested in the movie.That would be surely due to the marvelous cast this film offers. They manage to bring some genuine emotion to a movie that would have completely fell flat in the hands of lesser talents. Downey is as charismatic as usual and shows a wide range of depth, getting also the chance to really shine in some scenes. And I'm not talking about the witty banter he goes occasionally off with, which was kind of annoying here and there because it's so expected. I'm talking about some very intimate and realistic scenes with Duvall. Speaking of Duvall, he is the high point of the movie. His performance is simply the proof of one of the greatest actors in cinema history. The rest of the cast rounds up the movie really well without there being any weak links. They keep a story that has some true validity to it alive and flowing well despite a runtime that isn't truly justified. Yet, I must admit I was never bored in anyways and there were some points in which I was genuinely asking myself ""Hey, how is this going to go?"" demonstrating a true investment in the characters who are built with a lot of detail.This detail is fascinating in parts, but disappointing in others. What I mean is that the clichés in this film are really just too many. The direction certainly doesn't help here because it feels like all of the actors were directing themselves. There is no style, no stamp on this movie. It is very clumsily put together and doesn't have much true energy carrying it. It also fails in part in screen writing, whilst on one side there is a very good story in it on the other the dialogue just feels wrong and out of nowhere a lot of times and other times I actually lost the sense of the scene. That is also probably due to editing which isn't in anyway the brilliant part of ""The Judge"".I felt pretty captivated by the movie in the theater and had a good offering of a courtroom drama. Yet upon leaving the theater there isn't really anything amazing that sticks out and I think I will probably forget the majority of the film by the end of the year.",The Judge
107,scottshak_111,A stellar performance in an epic drama,8,29 October 2014,"‎Robert Duvall‬ is outstanding and so is Robert Downey Jr.Little outbursts and disagreements of the duo have been executed brilliantly and framed exceptionally well by ‪Dobkin‬. The bit where Duvall rushes up in high squall carrying a temper whilst Downey follows for war is one of the most dramatic scenes that shows how puny nature is against human commotion! Humour is strewn in the movie and when you have Downey with the bat, it always makes home runs.Drenched with drama the movie has an apt theme that runs around the convicted irony - the Judge who isn't willing to let his guard down and who hates his middle son Downey for so many irreparable reasons that he can't just give in. Whilst Downey, the forlorn child who never returned to his parents owing to the long born and bred abomination he burnt in, tries to save him from the clouded murder of a foul-mouthed obnoxious hill-billy.The score is apt and the screenplay is intense.

On top of that, there's a court case to win.""The Judge"" is familiar but deserves some credit for its ambition on paper and it might have at least had a chance at working in practice of Robert Downey Jr.'s character wasn't so difficult to like. Aside from being cordial to his brothers and a doting father to his girl (who isn't?) he lacks a shred of civility to pretty much everyone he comes across with and even casually insults them. He's pure condescension in a bottle. Downey Jr. traditionally plays characters who are rough around the edges but the trait is amplified so much here that you leave this movie not wanting to ever watch one of the films (i.e. ""The Soloist"") where he hits the sweet spot with that character trait.Nonetheless, the film is definitely bold with how ugly it gets in the father-son relationship. It's certainly not easy to watch but it's something. Certain characters like Dax Shepherd's dim-witted lawyer and Vera Farmiga's Sam shine.The film is likely at its best with the courtroom drama underneath it all although it's somewhat under-served. It gives these unlikeable characters a place to work out their issues.The film is marginally worth watching with but flawed on a number of levels.",The Judge

Hardly any of that million dollar car, if any, would be left upon the owner's return. That was just one of the production values that was not well thought out, along with the Massachusetts locations subbing for Indiana. To me, that's filet subbing for hamburger. Many truths in the film, especially legal, were fudged to make a crowd-pleasing story. (translation.....profitable). There was a lot of ""they won't know the difference"" in the film. I always catch them at it.But, not to quibble. Yes, the story was contrived to beat the band, but Hollywood does whatever sells tickets, and almost never does encyclopedic truth so that was not surprising, but this was fiction, not a documentary, so that was OK to do if it made for a good story. Still kinda hard for me though, as I expect at least overall believability to engage me for 2 hours. The main actors did not disappoint however, as Downney and Duvall were at the top of their games, with Farmiga not far behind(she is a super talent and looked great). The script was super slick but very predictable, and we all knew what was going to happen at the end, but the film was of such high quality in its beauty shots, technicals and acting, that it mostly overcame its authenticity flaws and crowd-pleasing-ending-above-all to wind up being a mostly rewarding 2 hours.

112,trublu215,A sappy melodramatic film with good performances,5,13 October 2014,"The Judge stars an all star cast featuring the likes of Robert Downey Jr., Robert DuVall, Ver Farmiga and Billy Bob Thorton and is as surprisingly bad as a film can get. This goes to show that star power doesn't always guarantee a great film. The plot follows Hank Palmer, a stereotypical hot shot lawyer played effortlessly by Downey as he begins to prep for the case of his life, defending his own father, played by Robert DuVall. While the story does sound something like Oscar bait, this film tries to do everything right for all the wrong reasons. Quite frankly, this film is slow, barely touching, but well acted. It seems that Robert Downey, Jr is stuck in a playboy role. He does this so good and so effortlessly that I am hard pressed to give him praise because we've seen this type of character from him countless times. While his performance is good, he can't seem to separate himself from the Tony Stark persona that he has come into within the past seven or so years. Robert DuVall is apparently the go-to actor nowadays for either grumpy old men or estranged fathers with the best advice, both typecast roles he exhibits in The Judge. Much like his co-star, DuVall plays this role effortlessly and has played this role effortlessly for the better part of two decades. Its become old and tired with every film he continues to put out. Despite seeing nothing new from the two, the performances from our leads are good and do keep the film going as best as it can. The real standouts here were the supporting actors. Billy Bob Thorton, Vera Farmiga and Vincent D'nofrio are all fantastic in this and never miss a beat. If there was ever a good enough reason to see The Judge it is for these small handful of performances that stand out and shine brighter than the leads. The plot to the film, while somewhat unique doesn't really pack the type of emotional punch you want it to. Yes, there are sad parts and ""que the traditional sappy music"" type scenes but these well acted scenes are overshadowed by the sheer redundancy of them. We can only see Hank ask his father a question only to get a snippy answer so many times before we start to question Hank's motives. Why even try? The film doesn't touch base on a clear cut reason to why other than the fact that he's family and he feels obligated to. It didn't touch me on the emotional level I wanted it to. It didn't make me want to call my father after, it didn't make me think at all. I will say that when I saw David Dobkins directed this film, I admired his courageousness to be able to go from a romping comedy such as Wedding Crashers to a film as heavy as this. Despite this big move from comedy to drama, it only showed that Dobkins should stick to comedies. At least he has proved he is VERY good at that. This was an after-thought type of film, one you watch and enjoy to an extent but never really feel as though you want to dissect it or even watch it again. Overall, I was thoroughly disappointed with The Judge as a whole. The film has a couple really brilliant performances namely Vera Farmiga and Billy Bob Thorton but other than these performances, The Judge is a disappointing film that never really taps into anything remotely powerful during its bloated running time.",The Judge

114,FallenEye,Half-Mast for a Half-Masterpiece.,6,22 September 2018,"One of the three major elements that cripple The Judge, is its slow and awkwardly disjointed start. Robert Downey Jr. is too punchy for a story and script that requires a little bit of a more leisurely approach, and the director Dobkin seemed to struggle to make one scene fit seamlessly into the next; however this issue is way more evident at the beginning of the film.The second problem is, Robert Downey Jr. Though he was really fun to watch, I feel he needs to stay away from witty and charismatic roles for a while, because like it or not, all, or at the very least, the vast majority of what comes across is his alter ego, Tony Stark, and in this movie, a large portion of it felt like Tony Stark having issues with Howard Stark.The third problem is, The Judge tried to squeeze in too much drama, within a movie that somewhat jolted between genres. A dead mother, an accused father who's diagnosed with advanced cancer, a brother with shattered dreams, another with a mental condition and then Hank; estranged, angry, guilt ridden, pompous, divorcee in progress, damaged father, son, husband, brother, boyfriend and lawyer with something to prove and a heart full of pain, in a film that is a family drama turned court thriller back to romantic drama.However, with all of that said, The Judge really did have some amazing moments. The reason why Henry was named Henry. ""You got my bit 'o honey old man"" gesture. The spinning of the Judge's seat and of course, the real reason why Judge Palmer sent Hank to juvenile detention.The Judge is worth the watch, and if you're a Downey fan, then it's a definite must watch, however, the amazing parts in this film also further highlight how the rest of the movie dropped the ball, which is unfortunate really. 6/10.",The Judge

It looks good and I liked the performances of this club of A-level actors. Billy Bod Thornton is the 'bad' lawyer, but his role wasn't elaborate enough for him to shine.

117,Sonatine97,Professional Critics are not always right!,9,9 July 2020,"I was quite astounded/disappointed to find that the general consensus among professional media critics for this film, to be rather less than average (48% rating on Rotten Tomatoes)Yes, this family drama does have its fair share of cliched scenes that have been done to death elsewhere. Which is all very well if you've seen those films. But if you haven't, or simply don't care for such snobbery, then this film is still far more worthy and compelling, not least for the outstanding acting performances from Duvall and Downey Jr.I guess it would have been nice to have learned more about the breakdown between Hank (Downey Jr) and his wife leading to a divorce. All we get is about 3 or 4 minutes with them arguing at the beginning of the film, and then we never see his wife again!Similarly Hank's brief flirtation with Carla (the daughter of Hank's ex girlfriend). We see her in a couple of tangible scenes, but then she too is dropped, never to be seen of again.But those are very minor points. What was hugely enjoyable was Hank's difficulty with adjusting to his family's way of life in small-town America. And in particular his fractured relationship with his dad (Duvall) and two brothers.The courtroom drama with Hank defending his own father (a well-respected former judge in the town), against charges of murder and manslaughter after an RTA, were well done, but very much secondary to the story as a whole.The final scenes were predictable, but nicely done for all that. And the moments in the empty courtroom with Hank spinning the chair belonging to his father is compelling, not least for the excellent song from Bon Iver, called Holocene. The lyrics of which infer that the world does not revolve around you and your ego!Which is a good metaphor for Hank, who considers himself a big-shot lawyer, with an ego to match where he lives in Chicago. But being such a big place you're still fairly anonymous. Whereas returning to his home town, along with building a few bridges, could well mean he make a big and positive difference not just for himself but for those around him.",The Judge

120,Avwillfan89,Powerful family drama,8,29 October 2014,"Robert Downey Jr returns to his first dramatic acting role since ""The Soloist"" in this film where he plays an arrogant, sharp tongued lawyer called back in the town that he hates to attend his mother's funeral. His sour relationship with his judge father (Robert Duvall) is further complicated when he is arrested for murder, and he eventually becomes his lawyer to defend him. Throughout the film, both the evidence on Hank Sr, and the tensions between father and son rise up. The acting from both Downey and Duvall is absolutely superb, and the courtroom scenes are a perfect thriller-esque outcome.Downey's character Hank talks fast and talks people down a lot, which made it hard for me to sympathize with him at first. The judge father, a recovering alcoholic, has a very firm attitude towards all three of his sons, which explains the tough exterior for Hank and his brothers. Yet there is immense vulnerability in all of them that eventually comes out during the heated moments.If you want a good family drama to watch the next time you go to the cinema, look no further than this one.",The Judge

I think without a clear intention, a director will rarely achieve a good film. The judge does have good actors, unfortunately, as it often happens it has a very boring and weak storyline. The classic case of a successful son who hasn't seen his parents for over two decades but has to return to the place of his origins for the funeral of one his parents. Due to a turnaround of events, he ends up having to help his father in court as the latter is accused of manslaughter. While the judge could have been entertaining, there weren't any moments that really created tension and the movie ended up being quite dull. I don't know if it's a personal appreciation, but I really feel that most of Robert Downey Jr. movies are utterly boring. I have no idea how this guy came to be the highest paid Hollywood actor.

125,abouhelier-r,The Judge,9,24 October 2014,"Big city lawyer Hank Palmer returns to his childhood home where his father, the town's judge, is suspected of murder. Hank sets out to discover the truth and, along the way, reconnects with his estranged family. The Judge is directed by David Dobkin and stars Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall. It's cool to see Robert Downey Jr. in a role that doesn't involves him putting an iron suit on. This man has talent, he actually is an excellent actor, I recommend to check out some of his movies from the 90's to early 2000. Of course Robert Duvall was in To Kill a Mockingbird, he's a fantastic and iconic actor since for ever. This movie is exciting. Firstly I'm impressed; not only this film is funny but it's also very interesting, an almost two and a half hours movie and you are never bored. That's what I called Cinema. Though, there is nothing original about the story but it does focus a lot on hi characters. Plus, Robert Downey Jr. is excellent in this film; he steels every scene he's in and that's pretty the whole movie. As I said before, it's good to see him again playing an adult male character other than Iron Man, he's great as Iron Man but this actor can do serious adult drama movies and killed it as well. It reminds me of Zodiac. It's also great to have Robert Duvall back because for the past few years he was just a cool supporting actor showing up for few scenes and that's pretty much it; but here he's GOOD! Vincent D'Onofrio is terrific in the movie as well as Billy Bob Thornton who is the ""bad"" guy but he's just doing his job, he's underused. However, on the one hand there are some intense and powerful scenes between the two protagonists but in the other hand some are a bit cheesy and unrealistic. Everything involving the girl and her daughter in the movie could have been erased. It's evolving around this father and son emotion, you don't really need her. Vera Farmiga is a good actress but it won't miss something if they skip it, I would even say that this is a little irrelevant to the overall plot. Finally, I feel like there weren't enough of the court room scenes, that are my favorite ones; they keep showing those a bit boring and useless family drama dynamic argument when the main plot take place around this super interesting case. Overall The Judge is an effective and well directed movie with performances that all are very good, the story is very interesting, showing family bonding and doing something good for the world as when you walk out of this movie, the only thing you want to do is call your father.",The Judge

His son, the big city lawyer, steps in to save dad's reputation.The actors have all done a great job but the script was a bit of a drag and could easily have been streamlined a bit so as to make it more effective. Some scenes were quite superfluous & could have been removed like the deeply personal discussions between the lawyer & his 'client' on the witness stand. Also, the hint of incest was unnecessary & didn't contribute much to the story. The scene with the breaking into the cafe was also unnecessary. Who wants to see grownups behave so irresponsibly? Couldn't the ex-girlfriend simply state that she owned the cafe?The movie is very watchable to all those who appreciate good acting.

130,rprince-832-6294,Good but depressing,7,10 October 2014,"-The Judge is a film starring Robert Downey Jr who is a really hard-case lawyer known for defending guilty clients. When his mother passes away, he is forced to confront his father, a judge played by Robert Duvall. When his father is accused of a serious crime, RDJ attempts to get over the destroyed relationship with his dad to defend him in court.-So The Judge was pretty good. It had a pretty good story, but it was not the most engaging movie of the year.-The acting was great. RDJ did a great job, but I think Robert Duvall is looking at an Oscar nomination. Maybe. Also the supporting cast was very good too.-The pace was slow. I'll be honest, it is not the most exciting movie, and that is saying something considering The Drop was not about much and I loved it. However The Judge had the usual pace of a law film and/or a father/son relationship film.-Aside from a few that this film offered, it was pretty real. Some of the issues going on, especially physical illness, was tough to watch in a good way. It did not skimp anything that helped the story. Until the end, which was eh. Hey, ending was better that The Maze Runner! -The music was good. Just listen to Saving Mr. Banks. Same composer. Same music pretty much.-I know I have said a few negatives, but the film was pretty good. It had some REALLY grainy shots, but that was not enough to sink Tony Stark and ""I Love the Smell of Napalm in the Morning"" hashing out their relationship.-Content: The film is rated R for mild language including some sexual dialogue. That's how it sounds. Not heavy on much, but some language.-So to sum it up, The Judge was a little bit of a downer because of its slower pace and realistic storytelling, but it is a solid film with great acting a good story to tell. I would say that if you are interested in seeing these two Oscar nominees in a well written film that will depress you a little, it is worth seeing in theaters. If you are in for a funny film with RDJ as a judge then wait until you see it in a $5 bin. My rating: 7/10.",The Judge
131,palavitsinis,A guys' story - Real and raw to the bone!,8,23 February 2015,"Seeing the trailer, the movie really captivated me with the tension it conveyed. I was really intrigued to watch this particular father- son relationship, not to mention the mystery about the father's crash. I was rewarded for every minute of watching the movie and it has really been quite some time since I watched a movie that was so sound in terms of storyline and script. The characters were portrayed vividly by the actors and it was a really balanced cast in terms of performance. What could anyone say really about the performance of the father or the one given by Robert Downey Jr? This guy really evolves and progresses all the time.. I really liked the small parallel stories that went on, making you really focus on each one as the film progressed, in a way that you sort of forgot what was going on in the other stories, until time came to get the update on them as well. The accident, RD's marriage, RD's affair, his alleged daughter, etc. I was really moved by the role of the mentally challenged brother. This was a guy that had his own problems but he was always a voice in each situation that said out loud what others would not because of social ""musts"" or their own discretion. He was a constant reality-check throughout the movie.The end was a perfect wrap up and the final moments of the movie were both breathtaking and devastating. Seeing a 75-year old servant of the law getting out of prison with his health greatly deteriorated, the fishing trip with the son, the change in his behavior towards him, all of these. It is amazing how all the characters evolved through the movie into a better version of themselves and how in the end, even death came at such a sweet way, if I may say so. A movie filled with moral lessons and with moral dilemmas for that matter. It's a movie where sides cannot be picked easily and where the catharsis comes in the end for everyone but mainly for the father-son duet. It's really really a must watch!",The Judge

134,FilmMuscle,Robert Downey Jr.'s Failed Attempt At Branching Out,5,12 October 2014,"The Judge commences with a usually cocksure Robert Downey Jr. as Chicago's successful lawyer, Hank Palmer, who's just one of those you despise—the one who gets the affluent guilty off scot-free. He has left his hometown of Indiana and family behind years ago in pursuit of a career before his mother's death finally reunites him with his family once again: a father who's a judge of righteousness and integrity (Robert Duvall); a phlegmatic and mentally slow brother (Jeremy Strong); and a more strong-willed, mindful brother (Vincent D'Onofrio). Many old friends and, especially, his father are angered by his sudden desertion those decades ago, and consequently, Hank feels alienated upon his return and deeply frustrated with these complicated dynamics. In a legal family, the concept of forgiveness seems to be elusive. That is until Hank's father—a long reigning and revered judge, mind you —is accused of murder when a spatter of blood is found on his vehicle and the body of a murderer he strongly despised is discovered on the same road he drove down the previous night. Hank becomes wildly conflicted, unable to let go of the exhaustion and issues with his dad but also not buying a minute of these severe accusations. He forgets about Chicago and stays behind to defend his father in court, standing by the defendant in a criminal case yet again. Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall are the obvious standouts here, and if any aspect of this film is worth the viewing, it's these two performances—competently acted through the various extreme emotions necessary as they struggle to coexist in the same house and tryingly fight through this case. Downey is frequently smarmy and smug to no surprise, but he's additionally allowed to effectively convey plenty of pensiveness and dejection. In the meantime, several distressing scenes show Duvall at his absolute physically worst as a dying man of cancer— crawling for dear life, vomiting, (realistically) defecating in his underwear as his son despairingly holds on. At the same time, there's some talent in the cast that are either wasted or honestly unnecessary. I'm not sure Vera Farmiga's role, Samantha Powell, was meant to be anything but the standard romantic interest/emotional support during a predicament that Hollywood needs to implement into their scripts for the sake of a female character's inclusion. After witnessing Gone Girl, the amazing and rich female character that is Amy only materializes just how awfully bland most productions make its females appear. The nostalgically romantic, sexy scenes between Downey and Farmiga offered very little, and alas extended the already-protracted runtime with its garrulous nature. On a more positive note, the impressively stark black-and-grey colors and theatrical lighting of Janusz Kaminksi's cinematography, allowing for the true vibrancy of a courtroom's hue, elevates the story beyond something that could've easily been reserved for the Lifetime channel. One of my favorite composers, Thomas Newman, inserts his typical elegiac, stirring score except that it seems transparently manipulative here, unfortunately. Every moment of overt sentimentality is accompanied by a quiet, weeping piano.Emotionally explosive scenes of compelling dialogue are occasionally dispersed throughout this otherwise painfully overlong, syrupy melodrama. You can expect an abundance of crying and yelling, as well as overdone family drama on the side that's all too predictably resolved. In the end, The Judge isn't the best next project for Downey in his attempt to branch out from superhero movies.",The Judge

(My father was a lawyer). And with actors like Robert Duvall and Robert Downey Jr., how bad could it be? Answer: Not bad, really, but still disappointing. First, it was soooo long, nearly two-and-a-half hours, while the story wasn't all that complicated. Second, the script was what I call overwritten, meaning that much of what was said was very complex and sounded contrived, yet spoken very quickly, so it made me feel that the actors were just reciting their lines, not speaking from the heart. I think Duvall was better than Downey overall, as I find his glib style, similar to his awkward moments in ""Chef"", to be annoying after awhile, even obnoxious.

137,vistheindian,Flawed but impactful,7,20 October 2014,"Quickie Review:After the death of his mother, lawyer Hank Palmer (Robert Downey Jr.) returns to his hometown. During the visit his estranged father, the judge Joseph Palmer (Robert Duvall) is suspected of murder. As the case unfolds and the wounds in the family revealed, Hank has the opportunity to mend those broken relationships and reconnect with his family. The Judge is emotional and deeply touching, and it's all thanks to the acting powerhouse Robert Duvall and Robert Downey Jr. That alone is reason enough to watch the movie. It is slightly too long and some characters are not well utilized, but as a whole this is a solid movie.Full Review:Just looking at the cast I knew I had to give The Judge a shot, and for the most part I was right. Like I previously mentioned the two leads are what makes the movie work. On the other hand there are some cast members I would've liked to have seen more of and others a little less.Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall are the ones who brought the somewhat clichéd estranged father story-plot to another level. Both their characters are extremely stubborn, clinging on to old events as an excuse to how they behave. Hence whenever they are at odds with each other they bring an emotional weight to the scene. So much so that you actually feel the weight, and you might want some room to breathe because of how tense a scene was. Fortunately the audience does get some break from time to time thanks to its pacing and subtle humor sprinkled where appropriate. Also you are not always bogged down by the family drama, there is also a thriller element to the movie that is engaging during the court room sessions. Downey's charisma really shines during the court hearings because of the command he holds in the room.Where the movie fails is how it handles some of the supporting cast. Vera Farmiga's character for example is supposed to be the love interest for Downey. A lot of time is actually spent on their relationship. But that subplot keeps going around in circles and never leads to anything. Perhaps it is meant to show other relationships Hank is mending, but you won't care about that as much as how things are between him and his actual family. So to be honest that whole subplot and character could've been removed and it wouldn't have made a difference. Another example of mishandling a character is the one played by Billy Bob Thornton. He plays the lawyer Downey is up against, but the entire movie Thornton felt more like spectator than a serious threat to the leads. I would've loved to have seen them both clash heads in the court room, but unfortunately that never happens.Despite the mishandling of the supporting cast, The Judge is a strong movie. There have been many estranged family stories in the past, but rarely has the emotional depth that this movie has. So if you are on the edge or undecided, I'd recommend giving it a shot.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",The Judge

What needed polishing is obviously the thing in which most movies fall short - the writing. The estranged son returns home and reunites with his family plot is nothing new. Still it could have pull out of the clichéd screenplay with great characters and dialogues. To some extend it succeeds but with the tiring length of almost 2 and half hours 'The Judge' fails to grasp your attention. The performances are great, the duo of Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall have done a fascinating job. I was very much hooked half-way through despite the clichés. But as the obvious truths begin to reveal in second half , it felt bland. The length really made it boring. Things get overly-sentimental and the screenplay follows a predictable path.

142,AzSumTuk,I expected more,6,29 December 2014,"The leading performances were nothing short of excellent. I won't be surprised if Duvall gets an Oscar nomination - his acting here is very impressive. Downey Jr. is also impressive, and so are D'Onofrio and Strong. All in all, the cast is great and if you watch the movie specifically for its acting, you won't be disappointed.Kaminski's camera work is also award worthy. This guy is one of the best cinematographers in the business and although 'The Judge' is far from his best works, it still looks great.Dobkin's directing is serviceable, although it is far from great.The music is mediocre at best. I have some experience as a musician and a composer but I can barely remember any of it.The writing is just a bit better than the music, and that is the movie's biggest problem. At first glance it looks well written but that is only because the actors are giving their best, and then some. As a drama about a dysfunctional family it works. It isn't nearly as great as it could have been but it works. As a courthouse drama it falls flatter than a pancake. Right on its face, I might add. The only thing it manages to show is that the American justice system is about as useful as... something completely useless. Given Downey's last line, I think this is exactly what the people who made the movie didn't want to show. I don't want to spoil it but what happens to Duvall's character is a direct consequence of his own stupidity. Not pride, although the writers probably thought they made his pride the main reason for what happened. Just stupidity. And that is not the only problem. As the movie goes on, you get to see or hear about some really impossible stuff - one of the central points of the drama involves such a huge conflict of interests... It just can't happen in real life and it sends the movie's realism down the drain. Honestly, it felt like the writers had drawn all of their inspiration from some TV-show rather than doing some actual research on the matter. There is the same rhetoric we have seen in all courthouse drama movies. Again, what we saw gave me the impression that all American lawyers are taking extensive acting lessons. And there is exactly the same - and rather forced - dramatic situation of the jury telling their decision we see in every movie with a lawyer as a main character. There are also a few intentionally comedic scenes that just do not fit the overly serious tone of the movie.Overall, the movie is very watchable. But that is all thanks to the actors and the cinematographer. The writing is forced, predictable and unrealistic, and it is far from the best in the genre.",The Judge

It did an excellent job telling the story.Judge Joseph Palmer, played by Robert Duvall, is a respectful member of his community. He was the judge for 42 years, married for 50 years, and had successful children. Due to unforeseen circumstances, his wife passed away and it led to a road of mischief. The night after his wife's death, the judge had ran into one of his former convicted felons who was released from prison after a 20 year sentence. That felon was found dead on the side of the road, and his blood on the judge's vehicle grill.Attorney Hank Palmer, played by Robert Downey Jr., is the judge's middle son. Hank and his father did not have the greatest of all relationships. Despite their shaky relationship, Hank was brought in to represent his father in the murder trial.The trial took place for most of the movie, but that really was not the main focus. The main focus was more towards the value of family. Hank and his father were trying to put their differences aside in a time of need. It was not easy, but they made it through it. As the trial kept nearing the end, more of their previous problems were let out and expressed. Now that they were both much older from when their problems occurred, they were able to reconcile their differences.The trial did not end as what one would have thought. Judge Joseph ended up having to serve time, but it was not anything to severe. Once he got out, he and Hank were together, but things were much more peaceful this time around.

They used to be able to take the skimpiest of plots and flesh 'em out at minimum into a watchable film that had some kind of point. This thing, however, looked like it was drafted on a cocktail napkin on Tuesday night at the pizza parlor and then assigned to a series of crew members picked at random from the back of a cereal box. The acting does not 'save' the movie, it shows it for what it really is. Confused, dreary, maudlin and by the time it resorts to the precocious little girl to stall for time, ya know you're looking at a real stinker. I was waiting for ol' Shep the family dog to make an appearance and eat up another ten minutes. Guess ol' Shep had some pride though, he didn't show up. Cash the checks, keep your name in front of the audience and the people who call the shots in Hollywood. Is the last movie you made any good? No? Well, cash the check and move on to the next project. Who will know the difference? Cash the check and run. As for us, the paying members of the industry, the ones who get up, go out on a rainy night to see a movie and expect to be presented with a coherent storyline, competent acting, good production values and .. the bottom line.. for our good money..

148,adeckofcards,Fathers and sons,6,29 July 2020,"When it comes to family relationships, cinema always has something to say. David Dobkin's dramatic work also has something to say, although not necessarily new.
The story is about a small town judge, who is charged with murder on the same day that his wife passes away. Against this background, his children, especially his son Henry, will have to do everything possible to defend him.
It is as well as this history is outlined like a judicial one, but that really comes to be a familiar story. A powerful family drama that covers different edges, perhaps too many and many do not end up fitting into the story. However, the truly important relationship ends up being that of the judge with her son. A story is drawn where the relationship of both is the support of the story, beyond the judgment itself. And this support is also helped by the great performances of Duvall and Downey Jr., two Roberts who give this film an authentic emotionality.
'The Judge' is a story of family relationships, of a slow but effective narration. Although it is sometimes a bit cliché, this can be left out due to the emotionality it contains.",The Judge

Duvall, whose legacy has long been established, doesn't coast on his reputation. He plays his character to the max.Good supporting performances by Vincent Donofrio, Billy Bob Thornton, and Dax Shepard.Movies like this that lack fast action and are not greatly suspenseful depend on our ability to identify with the characters. That requires a good script and good actors. The script is somewhat cumbersome, with overly long scenes and the aforementioned irrelevant sub plot. But the two star performers are top notch.

150,DarthPaul85,"Competently made, but lacking character.",6,13 October 2014,"I only went to see this movie because I like Robert Downy Jr. and Robert Duvall. And for sure, they were only good things about it.I can't say the movie was unwatchable, it wasn't. It definitely holds your interest and maintains flow as well as many TV shows, but the movie lacks any character or real heart.The script is actually quite poor- the ""funny"" parts are hit or miss, and most of them only work because Robert Downy is awesome. The ""dramatic"" parts are all quite safe...like a ""PG"" rating for intensity. And the Characters are all fairly stereotyped. You can write everything you learn about these characters on a post-it note. There are times where you'll scratch your head and ask ""...really?"" Basically, it's the lowest quality script you can run with and still make a watchable movie (so yes, it's still watchable, just not that satisfying). The only positive part of the script is the dialogue given Robert Downy's character. He's a smart character and does have a way of saying exactly what we want him to.Even then, the whole thing has a very ""just out of film school"" feel to it- some really obvious editing, and blatant music cues (that try to make you think you're feeling more emotion than you are) also add to the amateur feel.So in conclusion, I wouldn't really recommend this unless you love Robert Downy and Robert Duvall and don't mind an otherwise mediocre 2.5 hour film.

This, I'm sure, is the kind of role actors look for when they have no trouble paying the bills.Vera Farmiga is very impressive as the love interest. She's both beautiful and talented. But Vincent D'Onofrio was possibly the most impressive. There's always something just under the surface, whether he's playing a stressed out Marine recruit, an over worked homicide detective, or the big brother who missed his chance at Big League dreams, D'Onofrio may have given the most understated performance of the whole film.I highly recommend this one if you like quality drama.",The Judge

155,blufrog49,Top Notch Acting--Not to Be Missed,9,16 October 2014,"This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. The acting is superb. Reading that a couple other actors were considered for Duvall's role, I can't imagine anyone else as ""The Judge."" The plot is riveting with a couple other plot lines interwoven, and in a very meaningful way.Duvall and Downey carry the film, but other performances are equally good. For a nice change, Vincent D'Onofrio is held in check, when he easily could have been over-the-top as he often is. I would have liked to have seen a little more passion from Billy Bob Thorton, but it's all in a day's work for his character, I guess.This film is far less about the justice system--trial, lawyers, politics, etc.--and far more about family dynamics, of at least 5 different families that find themselves intertwined. But mostly it is about a father and a son who both loved the same woman (wife/mother) but seem to hate each other. Painful. No easy solution. No everyone-lives-happily-ever-after ending.Anyone who is familiar with my reviews knows I disdain so much use of the f-word, and while it is sprinkled throughout the film, it is not really all that offensive as it is not used as if the writers could not come up with any other verbs and adjectives, as is so often the case in today's movies.My one complaint is that in this movie, like so many others, seat belts are rarely used. I don't understand why. And it is particularly noticeable here because the plot revolves around a couple of car accidents.NOT a film for kids, but highly recommended for adults, even if the family dynamics make you squirm a bit--for many of us, they hit pretty close to home.",The Judge
156,thomas-w15,"Unoriginal film, but with great acting throughout",6,20 November 2014,"The Judge: When I first saw the trailer for The Judge, I thought ""I have seen this kind of movie before. Why should I see it again?"" I decided to see it for the same reason most people ended up seeing it, because of Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall. They were the difference makers in this film. Without them, The Judge would have been a total failure. The only thing getting the audience past the clichés and generic plot we have all seen before is the amazing performances by Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall. The fire and ice relationship between the father and son is nothing new and I can probably recall five movies in the past two years that have the same aspect in their movies. Luckily, its the first time they did it with these actors. Also the director goes way over the top when it comes to the subliminal messages it uses. For example, when the sun comes out, everything is resolved, but during a tornado, everything is chaotic. This technique is commonly used, so I cannot blame the director too much.If you have not gotten a feel of my opinion for the plot yet, I nicely say ""it could have been better."" Do not get me wrong, just because it is clichéd and predictable plot does not mean it is not enjoyable. I did enjoy The Judge. Still, it could have been better. The reason I enjoyed the film was almost entirely because of acting, but I also appreciated the shots. For this particular film, I seem to notice the high quality of cinematography. The cinematography really gave the audience a realistic view of how everything should look. Now we come to the acting. I firmly believe that no one could have done a better job than Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall. Without them, this movie would have been way below average. The chemistry Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall had on-screen was remarkable. If no one ever knew them before, they could have convinced that person they were father and son. This is not a typical father-son relationship either, it has to be in the top ten most-dysfunctional father-son relationships ever. It really reminded me so much about how a family is when a father and son are too much alike. This is why these actors are so good. Most everyone will like this movie, even if it is slightly forgettable. If you are fans of Robert Downey Jr. or Robert Duvall, I recommend you see this film in theaters.

It just seemed like it because of the laziness of the screenwriters who must have decided to go through the cliché encyclopedia, over originality, and hope the cast could save it. They couldn't. I could go over each of the clichés but then I would be forced to do a spoiler alert. There was one scene that was terrific but it was felled by so many that were clunkers. This movie promised to be a courtroom drama where you weren't sure of guilt or innocence until the last scene but that proved to be more background noise than real courtroom drama.

Having a slow beginning, the main plot takes a certain time to show up. When the story starts to develop, the film manages to intrigue and captivate from the mystery approached. The court scenes are amazing, having such powerful and breathtaking dialogues. Another interesting aspect from these scenes is the shooting as they're more shady and darker, making the place have a atmosphere much more dense and heavier. The scenes would not have such greatness if weren't for the brilliant performances, which are not limited to the court, showing the troubled relation between the two, having beautiful scenes where we could feel the love, even despite the sadness and resentments that shook the family relation.

I don't wish to be derogatory towards Indiana,but I was distracted by how the landscape didn't look like what I thought Indiana would look like. I think of Indiana as being mostly flat, mostly farmland,and fairly dry and hot. The country side around the small town in this film was anything but that. It was hilly,wooded with lakes and rivers. It also seemed wet and rainy. I'm sure Indiana has some lakes and rivers and gets rain,but still,I was gratified to see,in the end credits,that it was filmed in Massachusetts,not Indiana. This might not be so noticeable if it weren't for how,through out the film,it's commented upon about how Robert Downey Jr.'s character has come back to small town, rural Indiana,after living in the big city for many years. I assume that there was a reason to not film in Indiana,probably financial,like tax breaks film projects can get in some states and not in others. But I hope nobody decides to move to Indiana based on how this film looks,which was quite inviting,because they might be disappointed by the differences.

168,BrentHankins,A tangled mess of cliché-ridden story lines offset by riveting performances from Duvall and Downey.,8,9 October 2014,"Since his first appearance as Tony Stark in 2008's Iron Man, Robert Downey Jr. has enjoyed a seemingly never-ending parade of roles that have allowed him to basically portray an exaggerated version of himself. Whether it's headlining the Sherlock Holmes franchise or popping in for a cameo in John Favreau's Chef, we always get the sense that Downey isn't so much acting as he is just channeling his innate charisma and energy into a different direction, and it becomes easy to forget that he's an acclaimed performer with a couple of Oscar nominations under his belt.If you're looking to be reminded of Downey's dramatic capabilities, then David Dobkin's The Judge should do the trick nicely. Downey stars as Hank Palmer, a big shot defense attorney who measures success by the price of his car and the size of his house (and his paycheck, as he quips to a colleague ""innocent people can't afford me""). In denial about his crumbling marriage and barely able to connect with his daughter, Hank's life is further complicated by a phone call from the small Indiana town where he grew up: his mom has just passed away.Returning home for the funeral brings back plenty of memories, both good and bad, and reignites Hank's conflicted relationship with his father (Robert Duvall), a well-respected judge with over 40 years of service on the bench. Judge Palmer has little respect for his son's choice of career, and the two can barely manage to make eye contact when they're in the same room together, let alone carry on a civil conversation.That changes when Judge Palmer is arrested for his suspected involvement in a fatal hit-and-run accident, the victim of which has a past intricately linked to the entire Palmer clan. Hank immediately jumps to his father's defense, a move that Judge Palmer reluctantly accepts when it becomes clear that his young, inexperienced defense attorney will get eaten alive by special prosecutor Dwight Dickham (Billy Bob Thornton), who intends to make an example out of the judge.The sequences of events sets the stage for a riveting courtroom spectacle, and while The Judge delivers on that promise, it actually takes a backseat to the family drama that plays out in the foreground. Hank's attempts to make peace with his father are merely a single piece of the puzzle, as he also struggles to connect with his brothers (Vincent D'Onofrio and Jeremy Strong) and finds himself drawn to the high school sweetheart (Vera Farmiga) that he left behind. While some of this material works very well, much of it feels extraneous and does little more than slow the pacing of the film.The Judge also suffers from many of the tried and true clichés that plague films about disconnected families, but we're willing to forgive those shortcomings thanks to the strength of the performances, particularly Downey and Duvall. While the script is surprisingly humorous and allows Downey to showcase some of the quick-witted cynicism that has become his trademark, the best moments come when he and Duvall are allowed to truly go at it. Years of anger and resentment manifest in every confrontation, bubbling up to the surface until the two actors are exchanging the the equivalent of verbal haymakers, each delivered with more force than the last. At 141 minutes, The Judge overstays its welcome by about 20 minutes, made even more perplexing by the fact that the filmmakers chose to prattle onward well after a poignant moment that would have served as a much better ending than we were ultimately given. But truthfully, we don't care that much, just like we don't care about the confused, tangled mess of story lines that muddy the waters of the narrative. Those things aren't nearly as important as watching Downey give his best dramatic performance in nearly a decade, or being reminded precisely why Duvall is one of the most enduring screen performers of all time.",The Judge

The characters relationships with each other change from scene to scene without any good explanation for why.

There is also a weird juxtaposition of what appear to be realistic courtroom scenes with reasonable attorney objections and rulings by the judge (think serious version of My Cousin Vinny) followed by over-the- top theatrical Hollywood courtroom scenes where one wonders if the attorneys and judge have fallen asleep or left the courthouse.

Hank has recently been informed that his mother has passed, so he travels back home to a small town in Indiana to visit his estranged family. His father (Robert Duval) Joseph is the Judge in the town and has been for decades. The night after the funeral, Joseph drives out to pick up some groceries in the rain. The next morning the police arrive to inform everyone that a man had been struck and killed on the side of the road by a car matching the description of Joseph's Cadillac. Joseph then is made to stand trial with Hank his estranged son as his representation. This movie had all the great makings of an awesome court room drama. The courtroom used in this is one of those old wood bench, to Kill a Mockingbird sets. A romanticized courtroom look that is often fictionalized but rarely exist outside of museums. This movie has a stellar supporting cast including Vincent D'Onofrio, Vera Farmiga and the legendary Billy Bob Thornton. There is a great plot set up with a decent air of mystery to uncover. And to top it off two great actors in a dramatic head to head, Robert Downey Jr. versus Robert Duval. Robert Downey Jr has recently been named the highest paid actor in Hollywood, Mr. Iron Man. I love to watch RDJ do his thing on screen. Always verbose, sharp witted, playing the smartest guy in the room. But do we ever get any range out of him? Are we really getting our money's worth? I don't know if he can turn it off. He is convincing in his roles, but never are those characters diverse. There is always a little Tony Stark in everything he plays. As for Robert Duval, the man is a legend. The academy has elected him one of this year's best supporting actor nominees. ( I think he will lose out to J.K. Simmons in Whiplash) I will say he is very good in his role, but not one of his best. I feel that the nomination here is based on past prowess. This is not the Duval of the Godfather (1972) or the Apostle (1997). If you haven't seen it check out the Apostle, it is Duval at his best I think. There is a great scene with him and Billy Bob that is amazing. So what derails the Judge from being one of the greats? ***************************Spoiler Alert********************************* One small very distracting plot element. After the funeral, Hank and his brothers go to a bar. He out verbally takes down an angry group of rednecks and wins over the affection of the hot young barmaid (Leighton Meester). She and Hank then make out like the ship is going down in a booth. Later in the film Hank meets up with his old flame Samantha (Vera Farmiga) where she informs him in a roundabout way that the girl at the bar may be HIS DAUGHTER. Then later she recants and says maybe she's his niece. This plot element is exponentially more distracting than say I don't know, knowing Leia was Luke's sister and re-watching them smooch to make Han jealous in Empire Strikes Back (1980). I know I'm a shameless nerd for that reference. Point being, incest is taboo and will halt a plot momentum in its tracks, having the audience shake their head in disgust. It was a minor plot twist that could have been omitted and kept a mid-level movie out of its mediocrity. The soundtrack as a side note does include two great little ditty's. Bon Iver's Holocene, and Willie Nelson's cover of Coldplay's the Scientist with his son Lucas. Overall this film is not without entertainment value. It is worth watching, but I say make it a Netfix or cable pick. I wouldn't put forth any money you're not already paying, or drive anywhere to see it.

Without top class actors such as Downey Jr & Duvalle involved, this probably wouldn't have been as moving to me. Throughout the film you learn more and more about these two characters, a father, who is a drunk alcoholic and a successful judge, and a son, a non alcoholic and very successful lawyer, see as they come together in court as they have a conflict between them both throughout the whole thing. You have some great supporting actors involved throughout such as Billy Bob Thornton, and Vincent D'Onofrio who also shine on screen,. but the spotlight is always taken up by Downy Jr & Duvalle as their performances are out of this world!",The Judge

176,VickiHopkins,Great Performances,10,12 October 2014,"I'm glad that I'm not some famous critic judging movies for a living in the newspaper or any other media source. If I listened to every critic and tomato meter out there taking them seriously, I would miss movies that are personally for me some of my favorites.Movies come in all genres - comedy, action, fantasy, thrillers, suspense, and romance. Every once in a while a movie comes along that is a powerful drama. Like the quote above, in each family there is a story playing itself out. Those stories can contain hope and despair, and The Judge is one of those gems filled with powerful performances that are creating Oscar buzz. I can see why.Robert Downey, Jr. is so talented beyond his roles as Iron Man, Sherlock Holmes, and other movies of fluff he has done in the past. The Judge is a challenging role but well-played for an actor I never considered a contender for awards--not until now. Like the character Hank Palmer, who his father hoped would straighten out and make something of himself, Downey has proved to the audience that one can overcome his past and be a contender among the best. Perhaps that is why he is so passionate in this movie, since his past is riddled with substance abuse and time in prison.The story itself revolves around a dysfunctional family, which most of humanity can relate to in one way or the other. Hank Palmer is the best of the best defense attorney in the big city, compared to his father who is the best of judges in a small town in Indiana. When his mother passes away, and he returns for the funeral, old wounds between father and son reopen. Not only is his relationship estranged with his father, but his elder brother is not a big fan of him either.His father on the eve of burying his wife decides to take his classic Cadillac and run out for a dozen of eggs. A few days later, the sheriff is at the door and proof mounts that Judge Palmer killed another man in a hit-and-run accident. As the incident unfolds, his refuses to have Hank defend him but hires an inexperienced attorney who can't seem to stop throwing up on the courthouse lawn before going into the courtroom. Eventually, as things look dimmer for the judge's future, he relents and allows Hank to defend him when his case goes to trial.Robert Duval, as the judge, is looking pretty old these days (after all he's 83 playing a 72 year-old-man). However, he's a legend in his right, and his performance is wonderful. Also in the movie is Vincent D'Onofrio, who you may know from Law & Order: Criminal Intent. He plays Glen Palmer the elder brother, while the younger brother, who is somewhat mentally challenged, is played by Jeremy Strong.The movie is intense, but not without a few humorous reliefs sprinkled here and there to lighten things up. I highly recommend it if you're a lover of drama. However, the ending may tug at you if you're tenderhearted and prone to tears. I know that I had to wipe a few, inhale a deep breath, and find an ounce of composure as the credits rolled at the end.",The Judge
177,brucetwo-2,"great acting in ""by-the-numbers"" plot",4,24 February 2016,"Downey, DuVall, Billy Bob Thornton--all give great performances. But the story is nothing new-- an estranged son comes back home and confronts his dying troubled stern father. Guilt, regrets and recrimination--and some kind of acceptance and a hint of redemption on all sides by the end.--SEEN IT ALL BEFORE! The characters in the script--they are definitely not as interesting as the actors who portray them. The older brother who lost his chance at an baseball career and runs a tires store-- again--formula stuff. Though Denofrio is great, as always.To get emotionally involved in these characters, you'd have to see them in a standard Network TV series melodrama--seeing their lives and ups and downs week after week maybe. These people's lives are really just not that involving here --formula, formula. (Can't help wondering if it was hoping to spin-off into a TV series--it's that kind of stuff).There are some non-formula parts to the movie though--Downey's ex-girlfriend dos not look, or act, like a movie starlet--but for the pregnancy--the Jerry Springer-like ""who's the Daddy??-- subplot, she seems real--or at least not a predictable plot formula. Also the ending of the film--that was better than expected--Downey's story is left hanging--he does not decide to reconcile with his wife, or move back to his hometown or become a judge-- it's all still up in the air--except for the bathroom coda scene--where he says semi-literate juries deliver compassion and intelligence in the courtroom--American justice is affirmed!--(Another formula ending--good guys win!)I think this film is exactly what it set out to be--a predictable, pitchable-in-the boardroom formula, with good stars and actors. And--it was great seeing Robert Downey playing a real adult instead of a comic-book character. On the DVD that I watched there was a very FUNNY ""extra feature"" Making-Of spoof. Definitely worth watching, It shows how much fun actors have--and again, the actors in this extra feature have more appeal than the characters in the movie here..",The Judge

In fact, not a fan of long movies, I could have kept watching for a couple more hours of these truly gifted actors. The plot while thin was interesting and will leave you wondering what would be the most just justice for the crime.But for a viewing audience that has been exposed to countless courtroom dramas on TV and in the movies, this was amateur hour. And Billy Bob's character starting out as a worthy and antagonistic counter to Robert Downey, eventually fell flat.

But especially what is the performance of Robert Downey Jr., he is masterly in this film, mixing humor and sad reality of a life devoted to his (great) career as a lawyer, having left behind family and friends. We see in this film a very interesting father-son relationship but it is not only that, Hank's career is often questioned, as he has only clients guilty, privileging money and glory to his family life, whether his wife and daughter or his brothers and parents. After having had to return to the sources because of the death of his mother, he finds himself confronted with his past. But he must also, as a lawyer, represent his father, judge, suspected of murder and who prefers his honor and his integrity to freedom.

186,craigdoolan,Mediocre drama almost salvaged by Duvall,6,1 December 2016,"This is one of the films that is enjoyable fare to watch but ultimately a bit shallow and unsatisfying. The plot was entirely predictable throughout and little to nothing was thrown in to challenge that. In order to overcome those failings, a really strong script and performances were needed and this didn't quite get there. The dialogue was OK but nothing special, I thought Robert Duvall was excellent and I also thought Vincent D'Onofrio did well with what he had, more screen time for him would have improved the film. Robert Downey Jr was, well, Robert Downey Jr. Much like Tom Cruise in a role like this, it seems too easy, too predictable, and all a bit contrived. I've seen this character just too many times, and Downey doesn't have the depth to bring anything more to it.A couple of attempts to broaden the plot were left hanging, such as his dalliance with the waitress that could have been his daughter. After the 'reveal' we didn't see her again, it seems she was thrown in to tick another box for the films demographics. We learned little to nothing about the disabled younger brother and after an initial magical moment when Robert Downey Jr's daughter met Robert Duvall, there was no more. Once again we see token female characters thrown in, seemingly to satisfy the need to have female characters in a film. The film didn't need it, either real roles were required or for them to be left out. The main female role of Vera Farmiga was also underdone, seeming the story of her career, a fabulous actress not given the chance to really work.Despite the schmaltz, or because of it, as a parent I found moments in the film genuinely moving, and don't feel I wasted my time watching it.

191,xylophone59,Contrived and oh no!-more Americana (again).,4,9 November 2014,I am a fan of Robert Downey. He has interesting facial expressions and is entertaining. But this movie is contrived. He is back in town just in time for his dad to be tried for murder. The inadvertent incest is gratuitous and seems like an afterthought. It is way too important an issue to be trivialized like that and then dismissed. Downey's character brushes it off as if he had spilled ketchup on his shirt; and then the issue gets flushed. A pity the excreta of his decrepit dad wasn't flushed but instead left on screen for all of us to see. Seems like nowadays things are put in movies just to mystify rather than as legitimate plot devices. Its like the director is so desperate to get your attention he will even leave human waste on the screen just to get you to not fall asleep. I have seen worse but the reflective Americana reminiscent of Five Easy Pieces has now worn thin to the point of constituting a cliché. The fishing with dad scene is hackneyed in the extreme. The Freudian parent-blaming is very America too. That reflective Freudian stuff doesn't really cut it. The viewing of the Mom's body in the funeral parlor should have been touching for me because only the day before I viewed my own Dad's body (who also idolized St Francis of Assisi as the mother in the movie did.) But Downey seemed to brush it off as expediently and cursorily as the accidental encounter with his niece. If the latter was so unimportant why have it in the movie at all? Downey might have been viewing a dead fish at the fish market for all the emotion he displayed to his deceased mother. The tenderness that should have gone to the mother went to himself-OK that was the narcissism of the character- but even a narcissist would show more emotion. The daddy is never home cliché as a reason for the divorce was pretty tired by the way. Maybe the producers (including Susan Downey) ought to live in a third world place for awhile to witness people dealing with real problems. This deep complex Americans-with -issues reflective genre is past its used-by date.,The Judge
192,RayKarago,"Not a great film, but a good one.",6,27 March 2015,"Yeah, thats the best way to describe this film. Good but not Great.It was nice to see Robert Downey Jr do something different. I think quite highly of him as an actor and it was nice to see him in a more down to earth role as opposed to Iron Man/Sherlock Holmes. Robert Duval, holy sh*t was he incredible. I loved those two together, they were both so imperfect and the fact that they all avoided talking about the sense of tension gave you the sense of a real family drama. The courtroom scenes were really tense, I love courtroom scenes and they were done well here. Billy Bob Thorton was great as the rival lawyer, he captured that ""scumbag"" feeling.If I had any problems with the film is that, firstly, there is a romance between Robert Downey Jr's character and Vera Farmiga's and it feels a little forced and unnecessary. Also, the character playing Downey Jr's youngest brother is not needed and did not add anything to the story.Overall, if you are looking for a great drama, this may not be it but if you are looking for a film that will keep your attention. This is worth checking out.",The Judge

I saw old gross Robert Duval who i never liked that much even in the godfather films. but then mine and everyone's hero Robert downy Jr goes and tweets about it.Starts Off like many family dramas do. Stereotypical bickering, uncompfortable reunion after decades but after it settles in it really brings you back home to the small town.The family has a tradition of legal practice but completely different. Duval presiding over a small town more concerned with what is right. where is son downy Jr plays the hotshot California lawyer getting scumbags off for big bucks.anyways old judge Duvall starts losing his mind and has some very serious legal trouble that threatens the integrity of his entire career and life and iron man comes to save the day. the court scenes where gold which Duvall's first lawyer played by Dax Sheppard who i would never have thought to cast as a lawyer in a million years.all that aside the reason to watch this movie are the touching scenes between father and son. reminds me of my relationship with my father, which i'm sure is similar to so many families.

195,Opalville,"Witty, brilliant, charming and timeless!",10,13 October 2014,"""The Judge"" shines on so many levels I'm not sure where to begin. Not only does Robert Downey Junior live up to his bad boy visage, but the supporting cast is wonderfully portrayed by other Hollywood geniuses.The script and cinematography never bow to cliché and are so wholesome that I immediately ran back to the concession stand to order a slice of apple pie, but the theatre was already sold out of them, no doubt by fellow patrons equally hungry for the best movie in decades.The stadium seated audience was filled to capacity, and I arrived just in time to nab a choice seat in the third row, hoping that my masseuse would provide much needed relief after staring upwards for nearly 3 hours. The film was so captivating I feared I might miss something whilst blinking.I was impressed that Indiana courts are so forward thinking as to allow lawyers to use cell-phones during the proceeding. RDJ keeps a phone handy (nearly glued to his ear) through the whole movie. But it is only when booty calls that he daringly answers, with sexy X-rated dialogue.The cinematic backdrop of unmoving and then suddenly breezy Brindisi Chicagoville trees and rushing dam h2o (day and night) under the bridge over unmetaphorically troubled waters are so beautiful I could hardly focus on the so-called actors. The movie features devilishly clever wordplay and RDJ's character even stately throws ""narrative"" out there like the self-serving affirmation of Hollywood that ""The Judge"" so proudly deserves to be. I held in my need for a bathroom break until the very last credit, and then let loose in my stadium theatre seat. I owe a deep debt of gratitude to all the peeps that made this happen!",The Judge

I've yet to see Robert Downey, Jr. give a bad/uninteresting performance and in this film he pulls out all stops. He's a whiz of an actor. Robert Duvall, acting his age, gives a horrifyingly beautiful performance in the last stages of his very ethical character of the Judge and in his role as the father who was more lenient with the defendants than with his family. The story poignant and beautifully photographed with all of the characterizations better than good - everybody is in sync with the other. I wonder why most of the critics, or certainly many of them, were not waxing more rhapsodic about the performances (I think they gave them credit, at least) and the direction.

After paying his respects, and clashing with his family, especially his emotionally distance father, a judge (Robert Duvall), Hank high-tails it out of there. Only to be dragged BACK in when his father (accidently?) hits a kills a local trailer-trash scumbag. What really happened that night seems fuzzy, and Hanks defense is exactly what his father needs, but will they overcome their differences in time for court?The Judge tries too hard to be both dramatic and light-hearted. Robert Downey Jr.'s sarcastic, fast-talking', too-smart-for-his-own- good character is a synthesis of every post-drug rehab role he's ever played. Which adds some welcome hilarity to the story, but every joke, every punch line comes at the worst time possible; either in the midst of a dramatic scene, or just after it, corrupting The Judge with a jumpiness that disconnects you from the film. And despite the bloated runtime, the script isn't as dense as it should have been, and wastes time on useless tangents that are either ham-fisted in their delivery, or contribute nothing to the crux of the story. That said, production quality in the Judge is high. The photography is exceptional, much of the beauty coming from to the scenic town of Jackson, Indiana, but also Janusz Kaminski's utilization of contrasting colors and earth tones. Even Dobkin's overuse of lens flaring works to some degree. Pity, then that the script is as jagged and inconstant as the scenery is captivating. But despite the scripts inconsistent and spastic nature, occasionally it lingers on Robert Duvall long enough for him to show us how a legend does his thing. The rest of the cast does a decent enough job, but their underdeveloped characters and the darty script never give them a chance to fully flex their talent.The Judge is the most average movie I've ever seen; a good concept poorly executed, a film with a good message that tries to be too many things. It's heart is in the right place and it has a strong moral center, but it's let down by a lack of effort from those behind the camera. So the dictum goes, ""if you try to please everybody, you'll end up pleasing nobody. The Judge will have its 5 seconds of fame during its time in theatres, then it will be forgotten, revived only years from now when it graces lists of films that are good, but you've never seen.

200,LiveYoLifeLikeYouMeanIt,"Good ""Judge""ment.",9,24 January 2015,"The Judge is a beautiful film. Critics don't like it. But then again, how often does the audience concur with their opinion, these days? Not much I think, and that's because while critics assess every minuscule detail of a film(yeah, I know that's their job), we have the liberty to dwell and enjoy those aspects of a film that captivate us the most. Powered by Robert Duvall and Robert Downey Jr.'s brilliant performances, this movie rises above it's rather streamlined plot. Considering I haven't seen all too many family dramas such as this one, I didn't find it cliché, but the point is, that the basic premise of the story while being generic was thoroughly uplifted by the performances and the visuals throughout the film. Granted I might just have been a little biased because the movie had The RDJ in it, but every frame of the movie was perfectly shot, infused with vibrant colour and detail. The many views of the countryside that abounds was literally eye-candy, and add to that the wonderful background score, the movie was ultimately heartwarming. Now with all the positives mentioned I would also have to add that the movie is a bit too long than it needed to be. There are also tiny other bits that might seem rather forced and contrived, but they can be easily ignored. All in all, there isn't much innovation in The Judge, but with it's performances, skillful handling of emotion, tidy execution and music, it is a most wonderful viewing experience.",The Judge
201,ZeeRaaN,its all about good acting,8,18 October 2014,"this movie is an example of how good acting can make a huge difference in any movie. Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall moved me in every scene. you relate to them and feel where do they come from even if you don't share the same problems with them. the plot was not very complicated. although you might get the idea from the title or the trial that it is a court based drama, it is not. it is more of a family drama, and the relationship between a father and a son. so if you watch it for the smart lawyer moves and court drama you might get disappointed, but if you watch it for the family drama you will love it.the only downside in my opinion was the role of Vera Farmiga and her daughter. I don't feel their presence added any significance to the story. perhaps you you edit out all their part in the movie and watch it again you wouldn't feel their absence. i feel that adding them just made the movie fall into the typical stereotyped ""a successful jerk going back to his hometown and reconnect with his roots and old love and become a better person""",The Judge

This movie is all about creating characters and,presenting their stories and their internal dramas and also them changing all through the movie.It is, in my opinion, an emotional roller coaster with sudden twists and changes in the plot but also in the relationships between characters.

They've all come together for the funeral of the mother but Dad is arrested for the hit and run of a former defendant in his court. The story revolves around the difficult relationship between Duval and Downey Jr who is a lawyer as they prepare a defense for the Judge. The performances by all are outstanding especially Downey Jr. and Duval. I didn't expect this level of performance from Downey Jr after his latest turn as comic action hero but we all know he has endless talent which is rarely tapped into these days. Duval, well what can you say about him. He's been exceptional from his first turn as Bo Radley to this latest as the Judge. He never disappoints. This movie makes you laugh and cry which to me, makes it an excellent flick. I can watch this again and know I will get something different from it.

With such brilliant actors and great cinematography and settings the movie still sucked pretty bad.The plot was predictive and to a little too Hollywood and cheesy for my liking. The actors well they're brilliant and they did the best they could with the script but if the script is cheese filled what are you going to do. Robert Downy Jr is a rockstar lawyer who doesn't play by the books (surprise, surprise) with a family he doesn't meet anymore he goes home on the death of her mother and has to deal with his uptight judge dad whose being presiding the chair for the last 40 years.

209,bbrown8870,Nice to see a movie for grown-ups with 3-dimensional characters,9,19 October 2014,"Although it's easy to see that much of this movie ended up on the cutting-room floor, what remains is a very engaging movie. Every actor is at the top of his game and the camera work is Oscar-worthy. Set against a backdrop of a idealized representation of a small Midwestern town, warts and all, the plot unfolds by having unusual, untimely stress bring characters outside their routines to reveal, perhaps, their real selves. And they need each other to do it.Courtroom drama that is the rival of ""A Few Good Men"" or ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and undeniable blood ties that have been denied for decades, make this a very watchable movie. I was riveted to every scene.Love your country? How much? Love your family? How much? Tied to your future? Are you sure? If you pay attention, you'll finish the film asking yourself all these questions. Which is a good thing.",The Judge
210,ameesha-green,A difficult father-son relationship story well told,8,12 January 2021,"I wasn't initially sold on the idea of this film but found it surprisingly captivating. As usual, Downey Jr plays the hard-to-like, arrogant, intelligent guy. In this case, he's a hot-shot city lawyer who returns to his tiny hometown to defend his judge father (Duvall) who is accused of murder.While the plot is centred around the murder trial, it's really about the troubled relationship between father and son (with the the court case and Duvall's making it hard for Downey Jr to defend him forming a parallel with the ""I want to love you but you make it hard for me to do so"" concept).The family dynamic here makes for interesting viewing, with a cast of heavily flawed characters who are not particularly likeable but are certainly believable.With the exploration of several relationships, it is slow-paced and packs in a lot but I didn't find it overly long. It's also beautifully shot, which helps to capture some poignant moments.",The Judge

It shows the aspects of a lot of families today... the triple ""D""; death, divorce and dysfunction.I don't want to generalize by saying that a lot of men don't have close relationships with their dads, but it does apply here. It's during this movie that you see the ""family tree branch out"" with home movies, confessions, tears, and understanding.You learn that things aren't always as they seem. Behind all the anger, is a Dad who thought he was doing the right thing by trying to get his son on the right track. Behind all the confusion is a son who couldn't understand why his Dad treated him the way he did.Yet, in all this turmoil, is a son who loves his dad and is trying to defend him against the court system and his stubborn self. All in front of a jury and audience of people who love and respect The Judge.It was really a touching story, and I congratulate Robert and his ""Team Downey"" Production Company for bringing this story to screen. I really enjoyed it. I hope others look past the fact that it isn't The Iron Man, and GO SEE THIS MOVIE!",The Judge
214,adityakumarprasad,"Gripping Drama, the Iron Man and the Judge will keep you hooked!",8,19 October 2014,"You should watch it for these two superstars - Robert Downey, Jr. (Hank) and Robert Duvall (Judge). At the ages of nearing 50 and 83 respectively, they are like the mecca of acting. The work is so flawless that never ever you will know that are actually acting! Hank is Judge's 2nd son and lives separately, visits his dad and his 2 brothers when his mom dies. On the same night Judge is accused of a murder, that too of a convict whom he has sentenced jail 20 years back. Hank is a very successful lawyer and after his dad tries out a new boy to be his lawyer for the case, Hank takes up the case. The movie is funny (hilarious at times), romantic, dramatic and has a lot of elements of suspense. Along with some fantastic performance by supporting actors, both the Roberts will keep you glued to the plot. Most of the 2nd half is full of courtroom drama and as it unfolds every scene gets very exciting. Disclosure: I love courtroom dramas. 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' is a good one (not for the faint hearted though). How Hank's romantic side unfolds is hilarious but tragic at the same time. Hank's relationship with his dad has gone through enough ups and down, the aggressive discussion between the dad and the son in the middle of the movie is very moving and touching, again fine actors at their best! Movie duration being 2 hours and 20 mins, is slightly long but will never bore you. I highly recommend you watch this one.",The Judge
215,trinaa15,One of Downey Jr's Best Performances!,9,17 June 2015,"I hardly ever write reviews about movies. Mainly, because I cannot be completely unbiased and because I tend to be very lengthy in my writings. This movie, I just finished watching, however, and I felt a burning need to express myself. I have loved Robert Downey Jr. as an actor for a very long time, and have also followed his career from young actor to drug addict to Ironman super-stardom. This movie made me love him ever more as an actor. He was raw, emotional and the best I've seen him in years. He moved me to tears at the end scene, and he didn't even have to speak. The movie itself was beautifully done. The plot was pretty well- structured but it wasn't so much the plot which grasped me and held my attention, it was the relationship between the characters, especially the relationship between Hank and his father (Terrifically played by Robert Duvall). Most movies I've seen tend to just wash over the character development, but this movie hit upon all the important aspects of the characters background without going into too much detail. The growth and change of the relationship between father and son is evident throughout the movie, though not overplayed or over-dramatized. To me, it felt REAL. I cannot explain exactly what I mean, other than it didn't feel fake or forced, or hurried or rushed. It felt as if you were watching the lives of two people who were struggling to find some type of peace with one another: For Hank, to find that long-lost acceptance from his father, and for the Judge to acknowledge that his middle son actually was able to succeed and become something important, rather than a disappointment. I would write more but my wrists are starting to hurt! :) Please, don't go by what professional critics say about movies..watch on your own and judge yourself. This is a moving story which has two very strong characters who find their way to accept each other for who they are, and with that, find some semblance of peace in the end.",The Judge

217,Aditya_Dutta,An opportunity to witness fine acting,7,19 December 2020,"The Judge, if anything, is a movie where the true capabilities of Robert Downey Jr. And Robert Duvall truly show. A long time estranged relationship between father and son is the central theme of the movie. Along this 2 hour 20 minute movie, you see the highs and the lows of everything about family. From death to divorce, it really touches base on the very core of family.The movie does a great job of keeping your attention, however it is definitely on the longish side and could do with some judicious pruning. A fine attempt by the director, however it could be a little tighter.A great watch, especially if you're someone who's patient and can actually appreciate slow movies where you can revel in the beautiful craft of acting by two top notch actors",The Judge
218,icyharris-539-169904,Straddles two generations of great actors,8,3 November 2014,"If you've been following Robert Duvall's career since his debut as Boo Radley in, ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" you could take it for granted that he has earned staying in the business this long. If you're of the generation that only knows Robert Downey, Jr. as ""Iron Man,"" here's where you get to see that he's no one trick pony. His smarmy attitude basically gets transplanted here, except with a backstory. It baffles me how some reviewers felt misled by the trailers into thinking this was a pure comedy whereas in the trailer I saw, it was more of a dramedy. It was obvious that both father and son had some deep history. Since I also straddle two generations, I could identify with both parties in a way I couldn't have when I was a childless 20something.This is another example of a movie where it takes two strong actors to pull off these two strong characters. They both chew the scenery like the dramatic courtroom scene between Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson in ""A Few Good Men"" and the scene between Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino in, ""Heat."" This was one of those movies where the journey was more important than the destination because you kind of know where it's going.However, I do agree with other reviewers that some characters and side stories were unnecessary. That it was so maudlin that it bordered on emotionally manipulative. That it was overly long. However, I object to it's length for more than mere editing. Having watched a ton of European movies, they often have, ""Is that it?"" endings when the credits begin to roll. It forces your mind to create your own ending based on the information you've been presented with before in the movie. The Silence was a great example. The beauty of those kinds of endings is no two people come up with the same ending, as you can clearly see on heated threads on IMDb. It's like European movies are brave enough to not fill in the blanks, not put all the missing puzzle pieces together, not attempt to wrap things up in a pretty little bow, because that's how life is. In this movie, as I felt with, ""Flight,"" that there were about several ending images where the film could have left a cinematic and emotional impact much more than the path it chose to take. That's what keeps me from rating it a perfect 10. However, it does not take away the enjoyment of the movie.",The Judge

RDJr is finally growing up, not as an artist, but as a man, a human being and is still in the throes of that journey. as am i.it's incredibly difficult work and a bit strange to get ones' mind around that we can be somehow separate from our true selves and not who we think we are and or want to be it's frightening sometimes. yet art and film and artists such as these, RDJr and his wife, making sure this got done, is an enormous tool that speaks to the countless among us on this journey.AND btw i'm sure this film is a real treat for normal folks as well.many layers to this film and a great effort by the director.

221,labnet777,Fine Acting. Boring Story.,5,1 January 2020,"Plenty of legal eye candy for the girls, but the story is plodding without any real twists. At the end you are thinking... is that it? More like an episode in a soap than a movie drama.",The Judge
222,streamofstars,Worth seeing for Downey Jr and Duvall,7,10 October 2014,"Firstly I have to say that the trailer I saw for The Judge advertised it as a courtroom/family drama with some comedy thrown in. Who doesn't love the family feud type films, where the black sheep of the family returns home for a funeral/wedding/divorce etc? And I was looking forward to seeing Robert Downey Jr in a different role from Tony Stark/Iron Man. What I didn't expect was a bit of a tearjerker.The story itself is fairly clichéd. A lawyer (Robert Downey Jr) in the middle of a messy separation returns home for his mother's funeral. His estranged father (Robert Duvall) doesn't want anything to do with him. He rekindles romance with an old flame (Vera Farmiga). It's the performances though that make it engaging and stop it from potentially being just another straight to DVD release.The film is beautifully directed by David Dobkin. Downey Jr and Duvall are both excellent. Their scenes are strong and emotional. I also loved Vincent D'Onofrio and Jeremy Strong (as Downey Jr's older and younger brothers respectively). They are terrific. Farmiga, Dax Shepard and Billy Bob Thornton are all great, but I felt they were somewhat underused.Even though I think that there was a bit too much going on and at times it got a bit too sentimental, I still very much enjoyed The Judge for the most part. It is a touching and absorbing film, that will make you laugh and cry, and if you are a fan of either Downey Jr or Duvall you'll love it.",The Judge

Having gone through a tough childhood, mostly due to the path that was setup by his father, he returns to find him not changed a bit.
Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall, the protagonists does more than justice to these characters, where finally the message is quite clearly spread across the screens. Family matters!",The Judge
224,Franco_Strydom,"Well written, potent casting, impeccable cinematography; an effective film.",8,5 January 2015,"""The Judge"" (Dobkin 2014) is a human story about everyday people living their everyday lives and it is beautifully told. I say everyday lives but obviously any film aimed for popular consumption will have a certain amount of 'not your average day'. That being said, this is a simple story told in a simple way. Contrary to my usual opinion this works really well as the simple plot leaves space for story that's generated between the characters. Also incredibly refreshing is the fact that the characters develop from beginning till end and that development isn't limited to the leads. All the secondary characters keep developing till the end of the film which keeps you surprised and the story interesting.The endings of films like these I often find a little awkward, the usual suspect for an ending is 'now that all the challenges have been dealt with everyone returns to what they were doing before', which can be boring or too ideal; let's be honest happy endings are disappointing in dramatic films. This film doesn't suffer from this. The ending leaves the viewer with a thought for what the character(s) might do next and not just 'they return to their lives'.The mention of the ending brings up the cinematography; the closing shot is incredibly well executed. Without a word the camera gives you a power relation, a personal revelation, a sense of closure and/or a wonder for what might happen next, all in some beautiful framing, blocking and editing. Beyond that scene the film is littered with beautiful camera work that contribute to the film beyond just showing the audience what's happening. The framing and blocking of action is artistic in quite a few scenes but not artistic in that it's trying to be; the honest artistic where the Director of Photography is on- board with the story and doing his creative part in telling the story though his medium. Now, to nitpick the photography I will mention that some of the aerial shots feel a little out-of-place. Like the rest of the film the aerials are beautifully shot and the movement is fluid, and there is almost the problem. We're not used to seeing traveling shots with perfect movement, stability and fluidness so when there's a scene where we're keeping pace with a bicycle and the cut of the edit is between two different aerial shots, it draws attention. I would have loved one of these cameras to be on a different rig – car mount or static wide.The casting was brilliant, I enjoyed all the characters and I enjoyed all the actors as their respective characters; the casting definitely plays to the strengths of the actors and the ensemble of actors plays to the strength of the narrative. As with any narrative story not all characters are made equally but ""The Judge"" (Dobkin 2014) allows each character a story, with emotion, cognition and background to the story and as an active viewer, that's lovely as it allows you to see beyond the frame on the screen with ease.I really enjoyed watching this film, I walked into the cinema with no specific expectation and I walked out having experienced an emotional journey with some engaging characters wondering what would be next for them.",The Judge
225,anoukandre,"Genuine, true-to-life family portrait with a side-dish of great courtroom drama",9,20 August 2017,"Family relationships are often messy, confusing, and heartbreaking. This movie acknowledges that. Family relationships are also honest, tender, central to one's identity. This movie recognizes that, too.""The Judge"" is a mature movie that takes all the time it needs to establish its characters, their relationships with each other, and to show off their thought processes and evolution. It is in no hurry to enforce opinions on you, doesn't take the easy way out, and lets the viewer draw his own conclusions. The story follows a middle-aged man lawyer who is still struggling in his relationship with his authoritative father, because those are not issues that go away all of a sudden when you're a father yourself; a man full of contradictions and stuck in an eternal defensive attitude. Robert Duvall and Robert Downey Jr. are both outstanding as father as son. Their explosive arguments and the entire dynamic of their relationship feels extremely genuine. All these unspoken resentments, all those little and bigger wounds that never really heal but fester over time are explored. The rest of the family dynamic, from the brothers with whom Hank (Downey) has a rather peaceful and tender relationship to the ex-girlfriend who seems to know him better than anyone, are interesting and authentic. No one is made too likable or given easy forgiveness; the character are nuanced and balanced.The courtroom drama was taken really seriously, too; it was thrilling to me and seemed very authentic. I loved the two other lawyers we encountered, and how different understandings of the law converge in one intense testimony scene. Nothing very Hollywoodesque to the courtroom narrative for me; it almost seemed European in its serious and professional tone (then I'm biased). No big reveal or unnecessary drama, just serious prosecution. Yes, this movie could have been shorter; yes, the story-line is neither original nor mind-blowing. Watch it for Robert Duvall and Robert Downey Jr. and an outstanding supporting cast setting the screen ablaze with emotions; watch it because with all its random elements and bittersweetness and ambivalences, it feels a lot like real life.",The Judge

This made me sometimes hate Johnny Depp because I think that lately he plays caricatures of success roles like Jack Sparrow. This was my idea when I watched the trailer of The judge: a trial version of Iron man! I cannot say that this isn't true, but I can say that this movie isn't only that. Deeply I liked the main character played by Robert Downey Jr. because he managed to represent a very badly covered fragility. The cynicism take plays but it's not the lead. Also enjoyable the second characters like the brothers and the ex girlfriend. Good performance for Robert Duvall, perfect playing of a iron man (the real one). I found very intense the scene of the two main characters in the bathroom and very truthful the relation between grandfather and granddaughter. Maybe the end is not very convincing, according to a movie of 140 mins with a good development. I think that from the last trail scene to the end the film is a bit fragile.",The Judge

About 3/4 through the movie it fell on it's face. It went into a spiral an never pulled out. I especially felt it was extremely weird that Downey's character made out with a girl who turned out to be his niece. I also thought putting his daughter and wife in the movie was kind of pointless especially the dialog with his daughter about a possible divorce. It added nothing to the movie. Honestly his whole fling with his ex didn't add much either. I was ready to buy this movie for my father as he loves these actors but the ending changed my mind.

Storyline is something which has never been seen so far with an amazing touch that fate can turn the tide for any individual in life whether he is a president or the pauper. I would rather not reveal anything about the storyline as it is a very good plot and something that has to be enjoyed and felt along the storyline !!!!! I have a profound respect for Robert Duvall and his character in this movie only increases it more for me !!! I am not a big fan of Robert Downey jr but definitely like his acting very much as it shows here !!!! He carries his role with such a swift that only comes for someone who has been exposed to the art of acting before a camera from his childhood and he does his role quite fabulously !!!

I dont usually watch Drama movies but for the sake of Downey I watched it and oh boy! What an amazing film.Sure it gets dragged around a little bit but the focus and plot of the movie doesn't deviate. The acting by both actors is really really good. They played their characters amazingly. The anger, the frustration, the cursing all very realistic.I was watching this movie with a pal who had lost his dad less than a month ago.

He is so well versed in making the multi- billion $$ blockbuster cartoon movie at this point, it's an exercise in redundancy (almost!) for him to act in a film like this one; however it's not a futile one by any means. Both he and Robert Duvall turn in fabulous performances, just as they usually do. I had actually reached a point where I no longer looked forward to releases of new Downey movies, because they are almost; as I stated before, resemble nothing near as much as a cartoon. When I saw the ads for this film when it was released, I knew in my heart that it would be a film I would enjoy thoroughly & I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone out there who is either a Downey or Duvall fan.

Robert Downey Jr. And Robert Duvall's chemistry is powerful. I am quite sad Downey didn't get the recognition he deserved for this, because wow... I was in awe of him the whole time. This film illustrates the complications of parental relationships. What I appreciated the absolute most is Hank's unconditional love for his father, even when he doesn't realize it's love that he's giving after all the years of strife in their relationship.

241,peterjkh,"Good cast, unbelievable story.",5,7 January 2015,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie. Some great actors, a promising story, so I was in for a treat.Well, to be honest, the acting was good (mostly) but the story itself was so wrong and unbelievable on so many levels, that it was ridiculous and pathetic at the same time.*** This review may contain spoilers *** First of all: OK, this son my not have liked his father (as it turned out, because of some punishment his father had given him when he was a teenager). Possible. And he never ever grew over it, despite the fact that he, as a child, in fact had been very close to his father. So he leaves home at the age of 20 and never ever comes back. But he obviously did love his mother, and liked his brothers. So why did he break up with them? Then, he gets a call (on his cell phone!) that his mother has died. It was his brother calling him. But if he had broken off all contact with his family, how did they know the number of his cell phone? Anyway, he heads home for the funeral. Despite the fact that he very much loves his mother, he does not shed a single tear when seeing her in her coffin. He looks at her dead body as if she is some ""thing"" and goes to the court house, where his father, the judge, is presiding a hearing. Really? Why would his father be working while his beloved wife, who just died, is laid out in a coffin at home, and people obviously can come in to bid her a last farewell (as all doors to the house seemed to be unlocked)? Then, those three brothers. Really? They are brothers? The oldest brother looked like 50 at least, Palmer looked like 40, and the youngest one looked like 25. In fact, at first I thought that the oldest brother was an uncle who was visiting with his slightly autistic son (the younger brother). They did not look like brothers, did not behave like brothers and were simply not believable as brothers.But we are still not there. The brothers decide to go out for the night and end up drinking in a bar. Palmer hits on the (very young) barmaid and ends up having sex with her, in a corner of the bar, for everyone to see. Are you kidding? And his two brothers are watching, drinking more beer and do not seem to care that their married brother is having sex with the waitress in plain sight? And all this just one day before the funeral of their mother? This waitress turns out to be the daughter of the older brother. This brother must have known (or at least suspected) that she was his daughter. Come on, small town Indiana, how many secrets can there be kept in a community where everyone knows everyone? So he in fact sees his brother having sex with his own daughter. But he does not seem to care a bit.And when Palmer later on learns that he in fact had sex with his niece – he does not seem to care either. He is more upset by the fact that his former girlfriend slept with his brother (after he himself had left town!) than by the fact that he has been intimate with his own niece. Really? The whole story about the father (the judge) being administered chemotherapy in some lodge is highly improbable too. Come on! I myself have had chemotherapy (the last one just 6 months ago), and this has to be done in a hospital. Not only because of hygiene requirements, but also: something can go wrong or your body can react in an unexpected way, and in that case, direct medical attention is required. So no, you can not just hook up a bottle of chemodrugs to your body in some remote fishing cabin in the middle of nowhere.I could go on, there is much more, but I think you get the drift.The story did have potential. If they would have focused on the relation between the father and son and the court case, it could and would have been a better movie – IMHO.",The Judge
242,wildcats76,Nice Try but Misses the Mark,6,27 March 2015,"Why set the film in Indiana, if you're going to film it in Massachusetts. I wasn't buying the Indiana setting. Why cast a mutt from New York City and a giant Italian guy as his brother? I wasn't buying any of them as small town Indiana people.This was the world's most dysfunctional family. They really stacked the deck. I guess it's possible, but I had trouble believing it. Car accidents, divorce, autism, illegitimate baby, incest, murder, chemo, vomiting, pants-crapping, peeing on someone, reform school, precocious kid, etc.I didn't buy Ken Howard, Mr. East Coast, as a small town Indiana judge.Having said all that, Downey delivered as he always does and the frames of cinematography were stunning. There's also some good dialogue.But this picture was too long, too convoluted, poorly cast, and lacking intrigue. The case itself was boring. Duvall can't remember certain things. Big Deal. I actually appreciated the idea of a slightly autistic adult brother who films everything with a move camera. That was an original concept. The romance thing fell flat. Totally awkward.But the movie is worth watching for the physical setting, the Downey intensity, and the dialogue showing family daynamics.",The Judge
243,Sapphire1950,Disappointing,6,27 November 2015,"Very good acting ruined by the constant use of the ""F"" word... I mean really, those writers can't come up with a better dialog than that? The ending disappoints because you have no idea what Hank Palmer is going to do about his wife and daughter, as all he does is almost screw a girl and then her mother/ex girl friend while watching his father die. And then there is that almost another kid with the ex GF who really belongs to his brother. I dunno. This could have been a great movie, but was too filled with unimportant junk to entertain the dumbed-down masses with vulgarity and sex instead of focusing mainly on his family relationships... That part of the movie was pretty good minus the middle school locker room vocabulary. I thought Robert Duvall was excellent in his portrayal of a dying judge. Hank Palmer needs therapy.",The Judge

Very well made film with some top notch acting, especially from Robert Duvall as the small town judge. My main problem with this film is some of the clichés.. Robert Downey is his usual cocky self, pretty much Tony Stark. Vera Farmiga who I'm a big fan of, does her best in the thankless role of the high school sweetheart who still isn't married and is delighted to see her old flame Mr. Downey back swaggering around town. Nice to see Vincent D'Onofrio as one of Downey's loser brothers. Like a lot of American movies the middle classes live in huge mansions and drive great cars. I'm jealous!

245,beachfl2001,Not as good as hoped or hyped,6,26 October 2014,"Unfortunately, this film doesn't live up to expectations. It's good, not great. It's bogged down by Hollywood's insistence of huge box office draws. Instead of making this film fantastic, the reputations of the two huge legends Robert Downey, Jr. and Robert Duvall just feel like they weigh this story down. We've seen these two characters before, haven't we? Even if Downey tries to be just a bit more of a self-important jerk than his usual self-important jerk roles, it's just not that much farther along. Billy Bob Thornton in this movie is just confusing. Why is the same character from TV's Fargo suddenly here? The intended tense battle of egos between his and Downey's characters is unimpressive and unneeded, as it turns out. The emotional drama here is the son's realizations, not his already-proved professional ability. We don't need the other.The ""coming-of-age by going back to the little and not-so-small- minded-as-it-turns-out town"" they came from is a theme more than well used, and it surprises to see it here. We get it. Just because people don't go out in the world doesn't mean they are small-worldish. Equally, just because people are successful and in the wider world doesn't mean they are big-worldish. Yup... got it. I sometimes think this recurring theme is actually just a successful writer's guilt and self-inspection. Luckily, though, the cast is saved by the fantastic work of the supporting players, notably Vera Farminga, Vincent D'Onofrio, and Jeremy Strong, who all give very convincing and compelling performances.Such a big budget deserved better. DVD this one.",The Judge

Both leads, as well as supporting cast did a fantastic job.While the courtroom scenes are not the makings of epic thrillers, they are realistic for that very reason, and I appreciated it.I wish we would have gotten just a bit more insight into the reasons for estrangement between the leads. That part of the film was the most important, but seemed rush.

Great response to a very complex character which is facing big issues and yet seems to handle the situation.Mr Duvall is another superb actor who delivers an epic acting which adds a first class legacy that puts him with the greatest actors ever.Great support from Vincent D'Onofrio and Vera Farmiga in particular, I enjoyed a lot their acting too, though, Billy Bob Thornton puts the cherry on the pie with his role. Excellent cast for an excellent movie.The movie itself is kind of complex and constantly changing its course, so you have to be always listening to fully understand why things happen.

248,ipseclewis,A Very Personal Movie,9,14 October 2014,"I don't want to get into any spoilers here, so I'm going to be vague; I apologize for that ahead of time.The Judge does a brilliant job of giving you so much more than exactly what it says on the tin. The trailer shows a jerk of a lawyer who has to defend his somewhat cold father, who was a judge for many years, in a possible hit and run case. Thankfully, this movie isn't quite so straight-forward.The family dynamic is relatively simple, yet there are so many wonderful small complexities that go along with that. There's an actual reason why this big-time lawyer not only left home, but has the personality that he has (no, it's not just a McGuffin to move the story along). There's a lot of tension within the family, but also a lot of heart. A couple of the supporting characters are a little flat, but not nearly as flat as they could have been. This isn't a movie that develops characters for development sake, but for the sake of the story.There are also issues that can strike a deep chord with anyone who has ever had to deal with anything similar in their lives. I won't list them here, as to avoid spoilers, but you might want to bring an extra box of tissues just in case. At one point I was muffling my own tears against my husband's chest to keep from balling out loud in the theater >.< I think if any viewers have had to deal with such things in their own lives, this movie is going to hold significantly more meaning than those that don't.

250,Clive_barons,A judge's egg - very good in parts,7,13 October 2014,"The two Roberts are great and the core plot -- the father/son relationship and trial -- are intense and taut. However, Robert Downey's character building (as a self centered, egotistical and win-by-any-means lawyer) is over cooked; it was obvious very early and other examples are somewhat redundant. The other characters don't add a lot of value and why is it necessary to feature a mentally handicapped person in the plot, as in the recent Jane Fonda film? Also, too many forced coincidences (Vera F is amazingly still ""hot"" after twenty years running a bar/diner and her very cute, but ""easy"", daughter's immediate engagement with Downey).

You end up with a dish that could have been so much better with a recipe.This same problem haunts The Judge, which stars Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall. There are elements of drama and comedy, thriller and court procedural, love story and family dysfunction all haphazardly thrown together in a 2 hour and 12 minute mess of a movie.Downey is great in his role as a prodigal son returning home to defend his judge father who is accused of a crime hard on the heels of his wife's death. The two actors are brilliant in their scenes together, but the director clouds the story with no less than 4 sub- plots that diminish the story. The sub-plots are sappy and unnecessary. The music and dialogue between the minor characters are cringe-worthy and reminded me of a Lifetime Channel movie.Had the director stayed sharp on the court case, and focused on his two brilliant lead actors exclusively, this could have been a wonderful movie.

254,dixiedragon,Do Yourself a Favor - Decide for Yourself,8,17 January 2015,"I keep reading about the clichés in this film and am at once confused and disappointed that so many people simply don't get that LIFE is a cliché. Everyone who has ever held an aging parent in their arms and looked at the almost glassine skin - so thin you can see through it, or held a loved one on chemo, the messy, sickening use of poison to kill a killer and witnessed first hand what it does to a person - all of them to a person is a cliché. Anyone who has ever left, be it home, parents, a spouse, a relationship, for whatever reason and never looked back until forced to by circumstances beyond their control - more clichés. Face it, life is a cliché, it repeats itself over and over again, only the characters change.The beauty of this film is that the actors have taken those moments and made them relatable. They are so talented, so skilled at their craft that you will feel almost embarrassed watching them - you will feel like you are a voyeur peeking surreptitiously into the most private moments of someone else's life. Each of these truly brilliant actors breathes life into roles that we are familiar with on a deeply personal level and they allow us to see ourselves from the outside looking in. The beauty of The Judge is that we are drawn into the film - slowly, a little more with each scene until we cannot look away because we recognize someone we know - someone we have loved - someone we have walked away from and returned to. It's been a long time since I watched a movie with acting this strong and it comes from ALL the characters - Duvall's ailing, demanding, proud Judge Palmer, Downey's hurting, haunted small town boy comes home, D'Onofrio's brother who was robbed of a brilliant ball career by his brother's recklessness, Farmiga's touching girl left behind carrying a torch for a past long since gone - AND YOU BELIEVE THEM. You know them.DO NOT let critics scare you away from this film. If you missed it on the big screen DON'T miss it now. When you feel those tears welling up I promise you will know who they are for and it will NOT be for Duvall, Downey, Farmiga - it will be for some you know... their acting has simply brought the real cliché that is LIFE, home to your heart.",The Judge

I enjoyed it as much as the first time around, if not more. To address some of the complaints - yes, it is a little too long, but the strong performances put out by most of the primary cast, especially Downey & Duvall (who thoroughly deserved all the acclaims and nominations he received for supporting actor) ensure that the movie doesn't feel like it's dragging on, even when it is. Yes, there were some unnecessary developments and sub-plots, like the love interest angle between Downey and his old flame. There was so much substance in the other, more relevant areas of this movie that it could have done just fine without a love interest angle, but apparently there is a rule in Hollywood that any mainstream release with a reasonable budget has to have a love interest, so we have one here, although it wasn't too out of place, just unnecessary. At the end of the day, if you were looking for something truly new and original, this probably isn't it. It is not without it's clichés, but the sheer enjoyment any movie buff will get from watching two of the best actors of our time at their very best easily offsets those clichés. As a legal movie, it's a solid courtroom drama with a fairly simply premise and two outstanding performances by Downey and Thornton going head-to-head. However, I felt it was it's role as a family drama where this movie really shined, with Duvall and Downey delivering two exceptional performances as estranged father and son, and D'Onofrio and Strong provide solid supporting performances as Downey's siblings. Overall, I gave this an 8/10, with it being one or two clichés removed from being a 9. Either way, it's a great movie that I believe will become one of those underrated classics that you'll see for years to come and continue to appreciate how excellent of a film it really is.",The Judge

The cast is strong, talented and everyone gives their best. Everything else from photography, sets, locations, costumes and direction is top notch.The thing that is horribly wrong with this movie - and with so many movies that have come out of Hollywood in the last two decades - is the writing. It's uninspired confused, dull and clichéd.The device of 'wayward family member returning to family home to face dysfunctional family demons at wedding, funeral, whatever' was stale when Shakespeare was a lad, but it keeps getting dusted off, tarted up with a stellar cast and a hip soundtrack and dragged out to waft past yet another cinema audience. (August Osage County, anyone?) This film also manages to blend in some sub-standard court drama, a confusing side-line into incest (WTF?) and the inevitable resolution with hugs, meaningful looks and a dead body.

There are gaps of nowhere going fast but it is not an easy story to run fast with. A bit predicable from early on, however, the story lends itself to the content with has some substance. With so many films out there that fall flat with high expectations for many reasons, namely hype and high profile actors, this does not always guarantee success, this is definitely not one, it deserves some pack per watch ability.

It is clear that this not a town with happy memories, which is hinted at through his intitial interactions with his 2 brothers, played by Vincent D'Onofrio and Jeremy Strong. His relationship with his father, the titular Judge (Duvall), is non existent, with the two barely on speaking terms.With Hank leaving, he finds that his father has been accused of murder, and this leads to the ""Big Lawyer Small Town"" scenario, where Hank tried to push against this community who are stuck in their ways, in order to prove his father's innocence, whilst reconnecting with an old flame and trying to maintain a father daughter connection too.Downey Jr has done so well out of the wise cracking Tony Stark that it has actually bled into other performances, and this is no exception. But his ability to switch between the glib remarks and genuine emotion is what makes this movie so engrossing, with some moments of levity (including a very non-typical shower scene that provides a funny moment combined with genuine love and emotion).Duvall is his reliable best, playing a proud man who is more concerned about his reputation as a judge in this small town than building up his relationship with his estranged son.A very strong supporting cast including Billy Bob Thornton and Vera Farmiga, and a very funny turn from Dax Shepherd as an antique shop owner come defence attorney, make this film seem shorter than its actual running time without feeling rushedAll in all, i really enjoyed this film.

He visits his home town to attend his mother's funeral, but an unexpected turn of events causes him to stay and fight the most important case of his life.With brilliant performances from Robert Downey Jr and Robert Duvall, their battle is a joy to watch. Robert Downey Jr plays Hank, the son with his usual quick witted, cocky and charismatic style is sure to be a crowd pleaser, and Robert Duvall's very humanistic performance as the bitter, stubborn father makes for a wonderful pairing of adversaries. Their outward contention is balanced well with their suppressed love for each other as father and son and the film is a wonderful emotional ride. The rival lawyer played by Billy Bob Thornton was also a nice surprise.Although the film was mainly about this relationship, several other characters played an intimate part in the story and it seems knowledge of their backgrounds were superfluous. As a result, the film felt quite long and Hank's brothers seemed to get in the way at times.Vera Farmiga played Hank's love interest and balanced the relationships well, but her character went missing for part of the film, but it was clear she was the right girl for Hank, who's marriage was in tatters. Dax Shepard's role as the bumbling local lawyer was a bit clichéd and cheesy, but added the much needed humor to this mostly serious film. The film's poster doesn't really do it justice.Overall, the film has a strong, heartfelt story and is worth watching. A classic.",The Judge

The lawyer later reconnects with an old girlfriend and soon finds out she is the mother of this girl. Considering the time line, the lawyer thinks he may be the girl's father and is disgusting at the thought he may have slept with his own daughter. He pressures the old flame to reveal the identity her daughter's father. She reveals he is not the father, but rather his brother.

273,BonMacB,"Genius screen writing, stellar performances, a must see!",10,1 January 2015,"This terrific film is vastly underrated. At its base is a powerful, nuanced and witty script which details the conflict between four wounded family members, each fighting battles with each other and the world, and each very understandable and sympathetic in his own way. There's mystery, humor, charm, love and a great deal of tension in this story, and the brilliant performances by Downey and Duvall are remarkably matched by the supporting cast. The director, too has a deft and subtle hand. There's sweetness here but no sap, there's sharp humor but no parody, there's mystery, and lust, and broken dreams, evil and blood, but balanced by great humanity. There's small town Americana and big city callousness but without stereotype, or whitewash. It's surprising at every turn. It's art. Could not recommend more highly. I'll watch it again. And likely again after that.",The Judge
274,moviemagic03,Poorly written script can't be saved by the stellar cast.,1,28 September 2014,"A lot of long-winded praise being bestowed upon a film that, in and of itself, is both long-winded, as well as a cliché-ridden mess. While I won't make the accusation (I suppose I just did) that the rave reviews are studio driven, I must have witnessed a different movie watching experience altogether. While RDJ does his best with what he's given to work with, and Robert Duvall proves, yet again, that he can turn in a great performance regardless of the screenplay, it is the screenplay itself that pulls the legs out from under what could have been a nice little film. A weak and poorly written script can only be elevated so high by its actors before it becomes obvious that it's a machine with no engine beneath the hood to carry it over the finish line with anything more than a whimper. The previous long-winded reviews I've read here left me with the same feeling of fatigue after reading them that I felt after watching the film.",The Judge
275,Floclung,"Great acting, good movie",7,15 January 2015,"I expected nothing less and nothing more from this movie. When I watched the Blu-Ray I went in expecting a heart-wrenching drama and though I didn't cry I got close to breaking down a couple of times, which I rarely do anyways. The acting was great, Downey Jr played his usual type of character and I loved it as usual, if you've seen Iron Man you know what I'm talking about and a terrific performance by Robert Duvall with a convincing and touching portrayal of an old and proud man. Another honorable mention has to be miss Leighton Meester. I didn't expect much from her but she honestly surprised me. She did a great job with what she had to work with and really stole the scene at one point in the movie. The story was pretty cliché and mediocre at best. This is what brings the movie down. I could already predict the ending from the middle of the movie. Honestly, they could've done a better job at making an original story. The directing however was pretty good. Nothing amazing, but it worked just fine. I heard some people say it is boring. I can certainly see how someone can come to this conclusion, but if you like dramas and good acting this movie will not bore you in any way. In conclusion, if you're looking for something with great acting that'll get you to think about the relationship between father and son, brothers, old love and losing family this is an adequate movie to watch one time and probably never revisit. Great acting, okay story and some nice shots. 7/10",The Judge
276,natalia-martian,Well worth the time,9,2 August 2015,"I have to start by saying I have a bit of a sweet spot for Robert Downey Jr, so I might have started watching the movie a bit on the biased side. But putting aside the bit of RDJ that is visible in the character at start, the movie is good.So what's good in it beside RDJ? First of all, the imagery is beautiful, the camera play exquisite and the drama dosage is at the perfect level.the story is heavy with family drama and it could have easily leaned into bullcrap sappy stuff. However, it unfolds in a discreet way (at least until it gets to the courtroom scene).I loved the fact that they gave the old guy an honorable ending. I loved the beautiful scenery, the camera works, the colors, the general feel they gave to the movie. I liked less how the movie played out towards the end, it seemed a bit like they were trying too hard to give it a grandeur that was there all along, just in the simpleness and natural way things had unfolded. I liked less the unfairness of the cold dish served to the brother, who kind of lived in the shadows and was left there until the end. But this is usually a part of life. Because life is not fair. Life does not deal cards according to worthiness. If it did, there would be a lot of unhappy jackasses around.However, I still say it's worth your while, even if it's a bit on the long side. When it was over, I couldn't believe it was almost two hours and a half long, there really was not a dull moment in it. Every piece, every step, had it's role in the whole.",The Judge
277,BStirlingG,great movie,10,21 October 2014,"Personally I think this film was partially inspired by a great RDJ film ""A Guide to Recognizing your Saints"" in which he played a middle aged musician/writer returning home to Queens to help persuade his father to seek treatment for an illness. Downey lit the screen on fire in the final scene of that film when he finally breaks down and verbally attacks his Father for not wanting to seek medical help and essentially choosing to die in comfort at home vs. go to a hospital and suffer but possibly prolong his life.But that's where the comparisons end, both films are great but the Judge takes it to an entirely different level with Duvall, and even D'Nofrio's character was good. Don't sweat the fact the movie is a little long, I loved every minute of it and felt it wrapped up the story perfectly. Not a second too long or short. Thank you RDJ for reminding us all how immensely talented you are.",The Judge

I wasn't in the mood for such a film, but I watched it anyways and I don't regret it. Personally, it shows me that whoever you are and whatever have you achieved in your life, you have to face your biggest disappointments and fears to reach personal balance and growth.

280,spdr11,"One of the best Downey Jr, Roles ever",10,24 October 2014,"The Judge starring Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall screened at the Mill Valley Film Festival before its theatrical release, where story writer and director David Dobkin was able to make an appearance for a Q&A, which we have transcribed and included below our review. Superb, truly an instant classic and must-see for any film lover or actor; because it truly is a writer's film and an actor's film. . Hank Palmer (Robert Downey Jr.) is a fast-talking, win-at-all cost big-city criminal lawyer who travels back to his picturesque hometown of Carlinville, Indiana for his mother's funeral. But after his father Joseph Palmer (Robert Duvall), a well-known and respected judge in the small town, is accused of murdering a man he had once sentenced to time in prison; Hank stays back to defend his father in court. Things get more complicated when Dwight Dickham (Billy Bob Thornton), a man disgusted by Hank's morally questionable methods, steps in as the prosecutor. . While working to prove his father's innocence, Hank gets reacquainted with his brothers; Glen Palmer (Vincent D'Onofrio), a soft-spoken giant with a once-prominent shot at the Major Leagues; and Dale Palmer (Jeremy Strong), a child in all but age with an 8mm film habit. And long-ago girlfriend Samantha (Vera Farmiga) a self-sufficient small business owner. . Every single element of the film was superb, from the story and writing to the art direction and cinematography to the breathtaking performance of every single actor. And audience member in the Q&A at the festival pointed out that the film feels as if it were based on a classical novel; a staple like To Kill A Mockingbird reimagined for a more contemporary audience. Shockingly, it's an original screenplay; a collaboration between David Dobkin and screenwriters Nick Schenk and Bill Dubuque.These scenes were made even more powerful with the level of talent present in this film. Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall were simply amazing. The actors went somewhere they haven't gone before, no better example than the bathroom scene, serving as a perfect tipping point in the story and their relationship. But every major character had their moment in the spotlight. Vincent D'Onofrio, Jeremy Strong, Vera Farmiga and Billy Bob Thornton were great supporting characters and we're quickly becoming Leighton Meester fans after seeing her in Like Sunday Like Rain and now in this film, where her brief appearance is very memorable.Perfect balance of drama and humor. Plenty of laughs throughout, which all come from the honesty of the characters and their situations. Downy Jr.'s natural sarcasm and ability to make just about anything funny help too. The heavy humor didn't take away from the intense drama of the story at all. If anything, the funny moments made the dramatic ones even heavier.Every story element came together so well, with just enough of a resolution for every single subplot; without going too far with the 'ending' lasting forever. The very last shot of the film is just subtle enough to be artistic and beautiful, just telling enough to be a satisfying ending.SPOILER ALERT!!:This film would be a tough one to find the right ending for; one which will both satisfy the audience and teach the protagonist enough of a lesson. So many well-written films screw it up in the third act, but this one ended so perfectly. The noble man must sacrifice himself to be true to the morals he hopes to pass on. But his son must also be given a chance to make a difference, to use his talents for good.So many people are able to be virtuous, until something huge goes wrong. Then they're willing to do anything to make it go away. Downy Jr.'s character didn't understand why his father wasn't willing to do anything to stay out of prison. He had to learn that morals are just for show until you're willing to sacrifice for them. If you abandon them when it finally matters, they're nothing. Sacrifice makes a more lasting impact on others, even in a small town it's an impact worth sacrificing for.His father cared deeply about his impact on others, and on the world he would one day leave behind. His martyrdom was a message to all witnesses, that his virtues of honesty and justice truly matter. And through honesty and the justice system, he was still able to get out long enough to spend his final hours with his son, fishing on a lake and recalling favorite memories. This is one of those few films that deserves nothing less than a 10/10 rating.",The Judge
281,Sherryist,Very Bad Acting On a Not So Great Script,2,15 November 2014,"Very simply put, these are some of the worst performances I've ever sat through. What's interesting is this moving is so long and yet no one notices there was absolutely no chemistry between NONE of the actors.Honestly, I a huge fan of most everyone of the film but this is just obviously bad acting and a bad script. I mean come on, Downey and Duvall both getting out of the car angrily and walking away from each other down the middle of the road? Really? How poetic, a hammed up father/son hateful relationship in which the two characters are exactly alike but don't see it in each other? I may seem cynical but this movie is a walking cliché that never would exist in a real situation.

I can't tell you how good he was here. Vera was amazing in the few scenes she was in as well. The story line was impeccable. Everyone in the theater was mesmerized and stayed seated through the credits...just not able to get up after such an emotional ride.The story is about a father and son and their coming together.

It seems more like reality show dealing with the issues from the past in the family. The Title ""Judge"" is misleading, because everybody is expecting to see a court movie and not the depressing family story. Near the end of the movie it becomes ridicules at the court room, where the father and the son are talking what went wrong in the past, like they were in some kind of the talk show. The theme ""court"" is randomly picked, it could be also a ""dentist"" movie with the same story attached.All in all, the movie is watchable, but don't expect any twist or point at the end.",The Judge

287,gamzeluna,"You HAVE TO see this movie, guys.",9,7 February 2019,"The film was directed by David Dobkin, which is I've never watched any of his films BUT I liked this one. It stars Robert Duvall as Joseph Palmer(The Judge) and Robert Dawney JR. as his son, Hank Palmer. The film won three award in 2014 for the Icon Award (Robert Duvall), Supporting Actor of the Year(Robert Duvall) and the director won Truly Moving Picture Award. The film is set in the fictional town of Carlinville, Indiana. Scenes filmed in Pennsylvania and Worcester, Massachusetts.The film is about a father and a son. Hank Palmer is a succesful defense attorney in Chicago and he is getting divorce. His brother calls Hank to tell him their mom is dead. Hank goes to the Carnville, the place where he spent his childhood. He joined his mothers funeral. Hank ve The Judge's relationship is complicated, it seems like they don't like each other. After the funeral, Hank was on his way to Chicago, his brother called him and tell him that his father is accused with murder someone. So he is back for his father to defense him at the court. End of the movie, they lose the case, Joseph goes to prison for 7 seven months, then Hank find a way to get him out of prison. Joseph dies when they are on a boat and fishing.I strongly recommend The Judge. It has a strong drama and a crime movie, so if you love kind of movies, you should see it.

Cue the cocky black sheep returning home and finding his roots again, to the simple well-meaning brother with a camera, contrasted by the understands-too-much-for her age 12 year old girl that still calls her parents ""mommy and daddy"" to every single small town stereotype that you can think of. Then of course the now-humbled redeemed black sheep returns to his shiny life with a new humbled outlook. But makes it home in time to go fishing with the 'old man' one last time. And of course they have a touching father-son moment right before the father dies on the boat. Flag flies at half staff (""no one says half mast anymore""). Guy gets girl he left behind.

293,panicgeo,One movie many messages,9,22 October 2014,"This movie had it all. It began as a sad story about a successful lawyer returning to his hometown (Downey Jr.)after his mother's death, to a place with so many bad memories but more importantly to a place where his father lives and works, a father he hasn't spoken to for many years. But in the end the movie was so much more than that.The acting is excellent. Robert Duvall is truly wonderful here as the lawyer's father and THE judge. I do believe this could be his Oscar worthy performance.As for Robert Downey Jr. I thought he was a very good comedian (which he gets to practice in this movie as well) but he is so much more. I truly have more appreciation for the man's acting capabilities. Also, an Oscar worthy performance.The messages are many. I found that the movie tried, and succeeded with flying colors, to mash up together a murder story and a story about family and how to break the chains and walk out of their shadow and ultimately a story about life, death and revenge.The punchlines come when you least expect them and for a drama movie there are a lot of funny lines, perfectly given by the two lead men, who literally take the movie on their shoulders and carry it on until the finale.Speaking of finale, you keep guessing what actually happened, as the director made sure we watched the movie from the judge's point of view. We, like the judge, are clueless as to what really happened and if we (the judge) did really commit the murder. The shots are beautiful and especially the court scenes are both shot and played to perfection. The underline messages are so much more (which I can't go into detail) but I give high praise to Robert Duvall's acting. I highly recommend this movie. I think the buzz is just beginning and I expect the movie to be at least on 6-7 different categories in the Academy Awards Ceremony (including Best Director, best Leading actor, best screenplay and best cinematography). If you are a fan of great story telling, wonderful acting and a close to perfect directing then this is the movie for you.WATCH IT AT ALL COSTS",The Judge
294,livana007,The Judge,10,16 September 2014,"I was able to see this before the October release and although I read some of the reviews that were released recently I started to have some reservations however, I have disagreed with some critics in the past and figured I'd make up my own mind about this film. Gratefully I did not have to worry because it was time well spent. The performances were excellent and it was witty as well and engaging. When looking at the posters (without giving much away) I got the impression that this film looks like something out of a John Grisham novel or an episode of Law and Order, and while there is the trial going on, the movie is more of a focus of this man's (Downey) relationship with his father (Duvall), his family, his unresolved issues with his present life and the life he left behind. Downey and Duvall don't disappoint as well as the ensemble cast.

And the more you find out about the supporting characters, the more you know about the two main ones. I have to be honest. This is not a movie for everyone. Is this for grown-ups? Perhaps. It is not about epic battles or fancy dialogues. It is a movie that will make you reflect on how you value your family. I would say this should be a required viewing for all sons and fathers.",The Judge
296,eem-439-229585,Definitely worth seeing for two amazing performances from Downey and Duvall.,8,7 September 2014,"I saw this film twice at TIFF and was quite impressed! It's getting some harsh reviews, undeservedly. Yes, it's too long and yes, director David Dobkin needs to work on his tone and pacing, but the story is great and the performances are fantastic! Not a simple courtroom drama at all, the story is more about Hank Palmer (Downey)'s struggle to understand his relationship with his father and to accept where he came from. It's about identity, family, and all the messiness and contradictions of life. If you are a teenager who can't sit still through a more-than-two-hours long movie, or expect some type of John Grisham or Iron Man-like action from this film, you will be disappointed. If you are a true film lover who revels in watching great actors practice their craft, you will not be disappointed by The Judge. This movie is definitely worth sitting through for amazing performances by both Downey and Duvall, who could both be up for Oscar nominations for their roles as the son and father, respectively.

303,emmueller95,The Judge is a Must See,8,26 October 2014,"The Judge is not merely a story about a son defending his father, who is on trial for murder, but a story about a son restoring his relationship with his father while also finding himself. The movie stars Robert Downey Jr., Robert Duvall, and Vera Farmiga. Hank Palmer (Downey Jr.) is a successful, Chicago lawyer from a small town, who left and never looked back, and if it's possible, never go back. Hank is arrogant and doesn't care if he is defending people who are obviously guilty. On top of this, he has a daughter and is in the early stages of divorce with his wife. Palmer must begrudgingly go back to his hometown of Carlinville, Indiana when he learns of his mother's death. There we find out he has a very estranged relationship with his father, who happens to be the local judge. While visiting, Hank's father, Judge Palmer (Duvall), is convicted of murdering a man he had sentenced to prison for 20 years and was recently released. Hank reluctantly agrees to represent his father, who in turn reluctantly let's his son represent him. This is not an easy case for Palmer. Throughout the movie, Hank and his father struggle to see eye to eye and to resolve their issues from the past. They both must get past their egos and pride. Hank struggles and just wants to get back to Chicago. But, while home, Hank also runs into a former girlfriend, Samantha Powell (Farmiga), who tries to help Hank get back to his roots. Hank struggles with this throughout the movie. One thing about The Judge, from a technical aspect, is it also uses lighting very well. When in Chicago as a lawyer, the use of three- point lighting makes this realm bright and feel almost fake. While in Carlinville, the use of natural and key-lighting is more predominant, making the scenes feel more realistic. This is also shown well in the respective courtrooms. In the Chicago courtroom, the use of three-point lighting makes it feel more cheery for Hank, as though he has the power here and he doesn't care about his clients. But in the Carlinville courtroom the use of low-key lighting makes the room darker and shows the seriousness of the situation, as though Hank feels he has no power, and the case actually means more to him than just a paycheck. The Judge is an excellent movie, with Downey Jr. doing what he does best: using sarcasm to make light of situations. Downey Jr. excels in the role of Hank Palmer and is becoming a modern icon. When he is in a film he seems to take over. His characters are similar, but he excels at them and does them so well, it doesn't matter. The Judge shows the struggles of a man who has to swallow his pride and try to cooperate with his father, while in the process of trying to rebuild that broken relationship and trying to get back to his roots, all the while dealing with different personal dilemmas along the way.",The Judge
304,junaidamirtipu,What not to like..........,9,14 February 2015,"A great cinematic depiction of the interplay of distinctly different human emotions! Robert Duvall and Robert Downey Jr clearly taking the limelight, gleaming brilliance in acting by portraying an interesting murder investigation on the backdrop of a family drama. Hate, rage, pride and self obsession, to love, tenderness, forgiveness and family harmony; there is nothing to dislike about this masterpiece. The father/son saga will surely strike a cord with the audience. Vera Farmiga and Vincent D'Onofrio also shine in their characters. Overall, a must see for believers in the good old cinema that thrives on emotion and drama.",The Judge
305,belonger-jeff1,Absolutely Loved This Movie on so many levels!,9,20 July 2015,"Luckily I'm not some famous critic judging movies for a living. If I listened to every critic or many who think they are movie critics, just like food critics, I would miss movies that are personally for me some of my favorites.This movie was so underrated. Absolutely brilliant. Hits ya right in the feels. Amazing! Amazing actors, excellent script, great chemistry between the actors, well edited and funny at times.The cast of Robert Downey, Robert Duvall, Billy Bob Thornton, Vera Farmiga & Dax Shepard did a great job. Great flick. Not sure why it had a 7.5 IMDb rating. I thought it was much better... and some great laughs with some great lines in it.Overall... it touched on family a lot, which was very appealing. Basically the good, the bad and the ugly regarding family. I thought it was well played out and written.",The Judge
306,radhikachemical,Thank you for making this film,10,19 February 2019,"I rarely ever contribute to IMDB. But this particular movie has compelled me to take out the time and pen together a review. Its screenplay, its storyline and most importantly its performances are par excellence. I particularly enjoyed watching Robert Downey Jr - a truly gifted actor whose talents are being grossly under utilized.The father - son duo (played by Robert Duvall and Downey Jr) are at ideological odds. Matters are further complicated by the fact that the father blames his son (Downey Jr) for a mishap that destroys the career prospects of the older son (D'onofrio). Their relationship is messy and the excessively harsh, grating taunts of the father does not help make things any better. The caustic words continue to do its damage but the overwhelming bond between father and son remains unshakeable. And it is this bond that keeps compelling them to continuously try to bridge the gulf between them.I resonated with this movie because of my own conflicted relationship with my father. How Hank feels about his father is very similar to my own feelings about my dad. Watching Downey Jr's character Hank struggle to put past events behind, to try desperately to put together his relationship with his father and fail over and over again, to want desperately to not care and yet be unable to walk out, to overcome the simultaneous bitterness and love that he feels towards his father provided a strong sense of catharsis to me. Its as if I can see my own emotions being portrayed by Downey Jr.Its tremendously heart warming - a must see if you too are burdened by unresolved issues with your parents, if you too have a hate-love relationship with them.The Judge is a story about real life characters dealing with real life issues. It provides a refreshing change from all those superhero movies that are being produced by the dozens. Really wish RDJ would consider making more of these. Do not give it a miss.",The Judge

This relationship is an amazing driving force for the film, with performances from Robert Duvall and Robert Downey Jr. that are incredibly touching, thought-provoking and a joy to watch.The film is slightly let down by the directing; there are 'dramatic' elements that are unnecessary and take away from the beautiful, well-grounded emotion at the core of the film. At times, there is pretentiousness through over-reliance on music and editing. But overall The Judge is a story about pride that contains an insightful, possibly frightening, but definitely therapeutic examination of family relations. A well written script that is supported by fantastic performances makes this well worth a watch.",The Judge
314,nmarti8251,Duvall and Downey Jr are Magic!,10,11 October 2014,This movie clearly is among the best movies I have ever seen. Duvall has a long and outstanding career and this is one that can be seen as the cherry on top! He may have been a tiny bit off his game in a few scenes but even with a slip he is head and shoulders above the majority of today's actors. Robert Downey Jr. has always been entertaining and very good but I think he has shown he is quite capable of any role he desires from here on out. The theater was full of mostly forty-plus couples and the tears and sniffles were coming from more men than women (though they did quite a bit themselves) I think a lot of men today revisited their relationship with their own father/son.

But for me the movie was all about the Father and son's relationship. Courtroom drama builds interest and the emotional part connects you to the the Characters. Pace is good as a courtroom drama and keeps you engaged. It touches the fine line for the perfectly entertaining emotional drama and overly bored one. Character of Duvall(the Father) is highlight of the movie. Give this movie 20 minutes and it will take you to the end in no time.

317,kczewski,Prodigal or survivor?,10,10 September 2014,"What happens when you go back to that small town that was home? Hank Palmer (Robert Downey Jr.) reluctantly goes back home to honor his mother at her death and faces the battles that he strategically retreated from when he went to college. This film takes an unmitigated look at Midwestern family life from the point of view of the returning son. Prodigal or survivor? The disputes and other scenes of life are realistically represented with Hank facing his father, Joseph, and the rest of the town the way every battle-hardened small-town returnee would love to do. The strong disputes and unflinching negotiations that Hank and Joseph go through lead to an imperfect peace. Robert Duvall does a superb job of portraying Hank's father. Where others would let Hank soften under his father's pressure and training, Robert Downey Jr. keeps Hank strong and sharp. In his best role yet, Robert Downey Jr. shows us that he has matured into one of the solid actors working today. You will see them both at the Oscars. The Judge is one of those rare films that tell a strong story without selling out to the usual Hollywood exaggerations. I saw this movie at TIFF through the eyes of a small-town daughter who made her break to the city to get out from under the strong influence of her father. This film evoked the strong emotions that I keep buried. Thank you Robert Duvall, Robert Downey Jr., and every individual involved for giving a voice to people like me! Thank you Robert Downey Jr. for keeping Hank strong with a good heart. The Judge will prove to be a classic. See it! You will be glad you did.",The Judge
318,lablizard,Saw The Judge today,8,10 October 2014,"Robert Downey Jr.'s ability to communicate realness continues to touch the human or iron heart. Each time he portrays this character who has serious youthful transgressions, he steps away from this artist's real life and expands the space between it and this talent he has to impress us.Duvall is tough and brilliant as expected, but believably vulnerable.Billy Bob fits the ironic 'justice is evil' part so well. He's SO good and entertaining at what he does. The pretty blue eyed girl, Vera Farmiga who plays Sam, is so fresh and mature and beautiful. In fact, each actor is allowed to bring their own creativity to this movie- to this age-old idea of a movie: the unfortunate family dynamic. It's a beauty. Don't miss it. Don't even wait.",The Judge

Supporting actors Vera Farmiga, Billy Bob Thornton, and Vincent D'Onofrio did a very good job as well.

Glad to see Robert Downey Jr. put up a great performance as the Marvel Universe seems to have wasted his talent. Robert Duvall is also excellent - reminds me of his Tender Mercy performance.My only complaint is the excess plot of new old love interest. Writer could have explore more about Downey's failing marriage and perhaps links it to the father / son relationship. Adding that element really interrupt the flow of the movie.Great acting performances need to be treasured with great story line as they are few and far between in the recent movie making.

Then main parts of movie begins and as a viewer, I couldn't stop watching and enjoying movie.

The movie itself is nothing less than remarkable, from the beginning to the end. For an actor who has been self-proclaimed by the Iron Man movies, Robert Downey Jr shows us the talent of an Oscar winning performance through the movie The Judge.Robert Downey Jr portrayal of a lawyer (Hank) presents a different side to Downey from the Stark role we are used to seeing on the big screen. From looking at the cover of this movie and the trailer I didn't know what to expect when I was watching this movie. Hank (Robert Downey Jr) experiences ups and downs with his family, his marriage and the people of his past life. Downey creates a more mature and A+ grade standard to his acting that we have never seen before.I don't think I could've picked a better movie to watch and highly recommend this movie to any person.

329,lukepiotr,A Touching Story about Family and Redemption,9,16 January 2015,"This is a touching and emotional movie about the bonds we have with our family, our roots, and what is truly important in life.Definitely not just a legal drama, although as you would except with a title like ""Judge"", there are a few courtroom scenes. Those are non-technical and are cut to a minimum actually. The real story and bulk of the movie is about family and coming with grips of who you are and what you stand for in life.Great, great acting by Robert Duvall (almost perfect) and not bad acting by Robert Downey Jr. I generally like Robert Downey Jr, yet his representation of the character here was a bit flat in some scenes, but powerful and very convincing in other scenes.I gave this movie a 9 mostly for the storyline and flow, and also for the powerful acting.

330,barbarasaintlocke,"Something different, something special. Unforgettable.",10,2 January 2015,"It is an original story from the director David Dobkin and Robert Downey Jr's words say it all ""it's a modern tale of conflict, judgment, death, regret, irony, family dysfunction, hilarity, and of course, unconditional love"". It goes way beyond a courtroom drama, it's about family, showing up for uncomfortable things, it's about not leaving things unsaid, and seeking for redemption, for forgiveness.It works so well that the most accurate comparison I can do is to an orchestra, each element of this cast is a brilliant musician with a unique instrument, and together they created the most sublime melody, so revelatory, unforgettable. This is art imitating life as it is, and people can relate with it because life is messy, people are not flawless, in real life there's no perfect way to deal with what happens to you. So whoever you are, wherever you are, you will be touched by this story, it will make you think and realize that if there's something you need to correct in your life, now is the right time.This is something different, something special, it's a great drama with great laughs, there's a lot of wit and heart in it, and we all hope to see more movies like this in the future. It's also the first movie produced by Team Downey and like Downey's character says, ""Oh, we are not done"", in fact this is just the beginning, an amazing takeoff for Team Downey.",The Judge

No CGI, no straining for avant garde cinematography, just perfect casting, writing, editing, acting, lighting, music, direction... If this movie isn't nominated for at least 5 categories, the powers that be are idiots... Or have forgotten the sheer joy of a dramatic story honestly presented. Duvall brings his best that we have all become accustomed to, and Downey redefined himself as an actor in my eyes. Wow. The way the director paces and develops the story line is exquisite. You can't imagine hardly a change in the casting, the actors are mostly perfect and nuanced in their roles. This film explores the scope of the human heart without being sappy or maudlin or trying too hard. Just go see this movie.",The Judge
332,wolfgang-a-koch,"Deep drama, with periodic comic relief",8,14 October 2014,"Some features of this movie seem hardly original: a legal eagle with slick tricks up his sleeve; a marriage on the rocks because one partner's mind is more on the career than on the family; a spark-laced encounter with an old high-school sweetheart right around that magical 20-year mark; and, finally, a dysfunctional family around which everything else revolves.Yes, there are clichés present in this movie. Their presence may, however, make it easier for us to follow both plot and character development; the clichés may be justifiable as devices to support a narrative that turns out to be much more complex, nuanced, and ambiguous as it unfolds, facet by facet.Front and center, of course, are father and son: Joseph Palmer (Robert Duvall) and Hank Palmer (Robert Downey Jr.). Other than both being officers of the court, they couldn't be more different from each other. Joseph is a principled judge with some of a holier-than-thou attitude, about which he feels right most of the time. Hank is a well-versed defense attorney with a somewhat unscrupulous finesse in making his case—as is necessary at times to get his client the most lenient sentence possible, if not an acquittal.And then Joseph suddenly stands accused of murder. He retains an attorney who really only moonlights as a lawyer, and who soon is in way over his head. Hank somewhat reluctantly takes it upon himself, then, to defend his father at trial.Sois Joseph guilty? When testifying in court, is he telling the truth? The movie slowly reveals and explores the demons Joseph is grappling with. One of these demons is a liability from Joseph's past and points to a motive for his alleged crime. Another of these demons is quite recent and might tarnish Joseph's legacy on the bench, regardless of the verdict.Meanwhile, Hank is grappling with demons of his own. These demons, dormant for a number of years, are now all the more virulent, now that Hank is on a forcedly prolonged stay in his hometown. Again, the movie takes time to uncover these demons in their intricacies.One of these demons is unrelenting in haunting both him and his older brother, Glen (Vincent D'Onofrio). Another has to do with his high-school sweetheart, Samantha (Vera Farmiga). Samantha, in turn, lives a lie she has been telling her daughter, Carla (Leighton Meester). This lie has a connection back to Glen, who isn't aware but would be if it weren't for Samantha's lie.So who, then, is to be ""The Judge"" of another? This movie illustrates how people have flaws, and therefore make mistakes that have long-term consequences. This movie shows that, even after the trial has ended, the consequences imposed by the system can be mitigated by compassion, the part of the human condition that atones for its critical flaws.And compassion is what the audience may legitimately have for both Joseph and Hank. Both are forever changed by confronting the unprecedented challenges in the turn of events. Neither Joseph nor Hank—nor anyone else, for that matter—can be readily filed under ""good"" or ""evil."" If all was not ""well done,"" most was still ""well-intended."" It comes as no surprise that it is Robert Duvall's superb acting that facilitates this takeaway from the movie. The character of Joseph Palmer requires incredible stretches in the portrayal of a man with both sharp intellect and cognitive impairment, and both wiry stature and decrepit physique.So who, then, is to be ""The Judge"" of another? This movie shows different judgments passed in the court of law versus the court of public opinion. The former centers on certain actions, the latter centers on totality of character. And the way the story is told, in the end it is the court of public opinion that has it right.",The Judge
333,patanderfl,Great courtroom scene,10,29 November 2014,"Duvall's testimony was as good a courtroom scene as has ever been filmed, and technically accurate, too. (I say this from 32 years as a trial lawyer.) Beautifully directed. I am biased in favor of Duvall, but I think both he and Downey are in the running for an Oscar for this must-not-miss movie. The movie itself might even be nominated for the Best Movie Oscar. For those who think this was a tearjerker, reflect on how profoundly life-changing it is to grow into adulthood without your father's approval -- or worse, with his active disapproval. The complexities of the sibling relationships is honest and painful and, in the case of the youngest brother, tender. The cherry on top is Downey's parting observation in the men's room to the federal prosecutor about the ""miracle"" of 12 average people coming together and doing justice. This is a true thing and is part of how the American justice system has managed to survive.",The Judge
334,kalolox,A lesson of cinema,8,14 February 2015,"Watching this film, and reading a series of reviews, has taught me something i thought i already understood but now is already crystal clear.When you are watching a film, and you want to analyze it, there are tons of thing you can think of: the cinematography was great, the music was excellent, the script is amazing, the cast and their performances are marvelous, the director's view is clear, etc... And that is one of the great things of Art, it is so great that you can find a million persons and every single one of them would tell you something different about the movie, and at the end of the day, that's what matters the most, if you like it or not.When ""The Judge"" credits started going down, i thought ""Man, this may be one of the best movies of year"", then i went to some reviews sites and start realizing that a lot o people were saying that the movie was to long, that it was a living cliché, that it was a poorly made court drama film, and as i said before, there is no problem in either if you hate it or love it, but just don't hate it for the wrong reason. The cinematography was great, you can immediately get the truly celluloid look and the tone they were looking for with great placed lighting, the score was accord to the movie, it was not overwhelming and it drive us perfectly in what is the main theme of the movie, WHICH IS NOT A JUDGE ON TRIAL FOR MURDER, if not the relationship between a father and his son, behind that there is trial, that works as our transport in this emotional growth that each character has, emotional growth that is perfectly performed by this two great actors which should be both at least nominated for the Academy, the script and passing are good, there is no way in that you could put every movie in a 90 pages script, some times you just have to tell more to show the story in the way you want to show it. This movie is touching, realistic and well told. I know this is not the most original idea in the movies universe, but that doesn't turn it in to a Cliché. Guillermo Del Toro once said that every movie story is already told, what matter is the way in that you tell it, and it can't be more true. No matter what film you see in this days, i'm 100% sure that if you look in the past, you'll find at least one that has the very same base story, what changes is the way in that it is being told to you. If you think like that, ¿every movie would be a cliché don't you think?, I don't think so. I'm a 18 years old Film student and i've watch a lot of films, and at least for me, there has being a long time since a movie show us this kind of son-father relationship and emotional growth in such a touching way, this is by far one of the greatest movies of the year and you should not hesitate while thinking if it worth your time or not. It truly does.",The Judge

It accurately paints the picture of an actual father/son relationship that most of us young and old men can relate too. I do believe this film is underrated and deserves a much higher score than lets just say, for example, 22 Jump Street that has a meta score of over 70 and i personally think it was a horrible movie that sucked really bad.

We are not professional film critics, nor are we filmophiles, as some of the people who regularly post here seem to fancy themselves... We are just regular, normal, everyday people, and we really liked this film. Was it long? Yes, but this is the first movie I have watched in a while that didn't have me walk out wondering why something seemed to be missing from the story. This is a feeling I usually attribute to studio pressure that filmmakers present a finished product that comes in under the 2 hour mark... Something ends up on the cutting room floor - usually the part I wondered about.I loved Robert Duvall's performance, and he is not an actor I have ever really liked. His character is going through so much, and I watched that play out at the hands of a very excellent actor. I would like to see Robert Downey Jr. In a film where he doesn't have to be the whip smart, always ready with the perfect comeback, character. The parts of this movie where you see his portrayal of someone with more depth were very, very good. Unfortunately, he will probably not be recognized for that because his usual character type actions/dialogue tends to overshadow the other.I have seen lots of professional reviews that did not like this movie. However, while we did not do this, at the end of the movie, when the credits began to roll, applause broke out in the theater. This impressed me, because other than at the occasional sci-fi movie attended by fan boys, I cannot remember ever going to a movie where the majority of the audience expressed their appreciation this way.Go see it. I do think that Robert Duvall will likely get an Academy Award nomination for this role.",The Judge
341,roghellman,A healthy change that will take getting used to.,10,11 October 2014,"Needing a break from software development, Ebola, and Kickstarter: I went to see the movie ""The Judge"" and left not sure whether I liked it or not.Reflecting on that, this is what I think happened:Many of use are familiar with changing something we are accustomed to, a healthier alternative, but change isn't easy. Such as going from using sugar in our coffee to drinking it black. It just takes time to adjust.Hollywood has routinely portrayed and romanticized the anti-hero. We've grown used to this fare. However, the anti-hero story is always rendered in a flash of time. The arrogance, drug use, womanizing, what-have-you always looks glamorous and fun. Realistically, if these behaviors were shown over a larger time-span, the results wouldn't be nearly as pleasant.""The Judge"" stars Robert Downey Jr, playing Hank Palmer, a prototypical anti-hero, a role Downey plays so well. However, it shows him over the course of growing up as a child into mid-life. The behavior that we've grown to like when depicted over a week or a month, is suddenly less appealing.It is realistic and healthy though. This is probably the most moral movie to have come out of Hollywood in years. A healthy change that will take some getting used to.",The Judge

The story is solid and well developed. Duvall and Downey, Jr. are phenomenal together and the supporting cast rocked it. I cried, I laughed, I was enthralled. I'd see this movie again in a heartbeat. I recently saw Gone Girl and left wanting. You definitely would feel that way with THE JUDGE. I'm not going to tell you the story as I'm sure you get the gist from the trailers. But the trailers don't do the film justice. This is the best film I've seen in a very long time. Downey, Jr. is soooo good! Duvall is the best! Go see it today!",The Judge
343,davidtsprague-131-6209,Fine example of a well produced film,10,12 October 2014,"Robert Downey and his wife Susan Downey have hit a home run with this picture. They understand that most of the events in any life are accidental or arbitrary, especially the crucial ones, and we can exercise little conscious control over our destinies. They understand that the ""Judge"" and his lessons were about how to behave no matter what life brings; about how to wade into the unpredictable court of law and deal with whatever happens with grace, courage and honesty. It is the film's best achievement that it communicates that message with such feeling.The relationships portrayed were superbly acted by all. At one point during the movie, while wiping away a tear, I looked around the theater and saw dozens of people around me doing the same. This movie was a treasure for many reasons, but the best one, I think, is that I could believe it. I could believe in its major characters and their relationships, and in the things they felt for one another, and there were moments when the movie was witness to human growth and change. I left the theater feeling good and warm, and with a certain resolve to try to mend my own relationships and learn to start listening better . . . watching the movie, I felt I was witnessing something rare and valuable.",The Judge
344,Htute6,What a Great Film,9,17 October 2014,"I signed up to IMDb just to say that, in my humble opinion, this'll end up being one of those much-loved movies the critics simply got wrong. It took a little while (15 minutes or so) to sink its teeth into me but once it did I was captivated. At the beginning I found it hard to get a handle on the tone of the film, which by the end I loved. I was expecting a playful film with some seriousness thrown in but it's really a serious film with some playfulness/humour peppered throughout too - in just the right way, and just the right amount. Once I realised this I went along with it (whereas at the start I'd thought it was taking itself a bit too seriously). It goes without saying that the performances are top notch (and not just the main two actors but the handful of others too). Overall, a great film. A really great film. Definitely worth checking out in my opinion.",The Judge

Good characters with underlying currents of sibling envy and a struggle for dads approval. Hats off to the writers. Great casting/!!! Great acting from the entire cast!! Jeremy Strong did a great job of the little brother that just wanted to see healing come to his family. Downey-Duvall combo was riveting/!!! Duvall is, of course, a master. Downey is like a fine wine--getting better all the time --maturing his Craft/!!!!

346,sana-mo-uk,"forget the critics reviews, watch the judge, if you want to watch an incredibly special film, which happens to have a stellar cast",10,26 October 2014,"Soo, was initially hesitant as well as excited to watch this film. Hesitant after reading some of the unfavorable critic reviews labeling the film as 'cliched','formula', simply praising the performances of Downey Jnr & Duvall. Excited because well, I'm a fan of courtroom dramas & when you have epic actors like Downey Jnr & Duvall in a film together, I really don't need another reason to see the filmAfter watching The Judge, I can clearly say all my preconceptions and assumptions got blown out of the window, along with the unfound negative criticism it received. Contrary to belief the film is not simply a formula films, Yes the story of a cut throat city lawyer turning ethical to save his dad from prison, may appear to be a bit seen-their-done-that. This is simply the topping of the film. The film is richly layered with a plethora of stories, genres & relationships, generously intertwined into this story. The delicate way the film handles the complex strained relationship between son & his father, as well as his siblings is one of the finest & most honest portrayal I've seen (and I've probably watched almost every estranged son-father film made). Most of all its an honest yet entertaining film. Its brave enough to not fall into a Disney fairytale ending, of many courtroom and dysfunctional family film. It has the guts to stay true to the story, its characters & the reality of when you have a family broken in many ways trying to function. The protagonist doesn't run off with his high school sweet heart into the sunset, nor does he manage to pull of a courtroom miracle to stop his father going to prison with his incredible lawyer skills, nor does his father doesn't jump into his arms at the end. YET it is still is a film which leaves you with hope & redemption. How David Dobkin created a film of this nature is truly a miracle. Its not a film which relies on its stellar cast to keep it running This is genuinely a great film in all aspects, screenplay, story, acting & direction. Like myself you may just initially see this film purely to see Downey Jnr & Duvall, but I warn you, you will end up seeing a great film",The Judge

If you are having tough time with your family or your relationship with some of the members of your family ain't the way you want it to be, something doesn't feel right YOU MUST see this movie. Speechless. No words. It is great to finally see a movie that's...normal, standard, human and full of emotions. No SF, no guns, no big actions, a real, hardcore drama. I loved it and I feel like I can't describe enough how great it was and I think I should apologize to all of you reading this for the lack of words. And of course, the crew in the movie...astonishing, amazing, incredible. To me the movie deserves nothing less than a 10. And... RDJ (Robert Downey Junior).

348,jamatheny,"Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall capture something beautiful in ""The Judge""",9,1 December 2014,"""The Judge"" is a failure in a lot of ways. It takes on too many stories at once and leaves most of them hanging–with no end in sight. The movie tries too hard to win an Oscar, and it's loosely held together by a fantastic father-son relationship with two star actors: Robert Duvall and Robert Downey Jr.The movie starts with Robert Downey Jr. pissing on a lawyer and ends with him looking at a chair. It involves an incestuous drunken night at a bar, a terribly outdated concert t-shirt, an awkward family and a whole lot of courtroom shenanigans with no real legal basis.The most memorable moment in the film is a scene in which Robert Duvall has explosive diarrhea all over the bathroom and the audience has the opportunity (displeasure?) of watching Robert Downey Jr. rinse said diarrhea off of his father. You could say that this scene didn't need to happen, and probably shouldn't have.But that would be missing the point. Yes, the movie has a lot of quirks. Yes, it's awkward and frustrating and leaves you with so many questions you feel like your head is going to explode. But that's the point. The film is all about the awkward, tense relationship between a hard-ass father dying of cancer and at risk of going to jail, and his not so straight-edge son. All that other stuff is just background noise to divert your attention from an on-screen relationship that could make even the most reserved man cry. The emotional appeal is what it's really all about. The other stuff–the renewed relationship with a past lover (and brief escapade with her daughter), the impending divorce and the strain that puts on a little girl, and perhaps most significantly, Robert Downey Jr. playing his typical role: a rich asshole–all provides comic relief from something that would be far too emotionally intense to sit through. And to the critics who argue that the film would fail if not for the star performances of Robert Duvall and Robert Downey Jr., you are completely off base. When the main focus of the film is to examine such an intense, strained relationship, then shouldn't the highlight of the film be the performances of those two actors? Yes–if not for those two performances the film would be awful. It would fail to hold the attention of the audience, and it certainly would not make the tears flow. But why is that a bad thing? Shouldn't we praise the movie for what it gets right? Because never before has a father and son relationship been captured so beautifully on screen.So should you go see two men named Robert hash out their differences on-screen? Absolutely–but don't forget to bring the tissues.",The Judge

Love the actors, love the story...I laughed, I cried. It warmed my heart. I WILL own this movie when it comes out on video. I went back to see it again with my teenage sons and once the movie was over, my 17 year old turned to me and said, ""That was easily one of the best movies I've ever seen."" It's a story of the misunderstanding, fear, frustration, love, hope, and forgiveness that comes with having a family. Downey and Duvall gave unmatched performances. If I wasn't already a fan, this would have made me one for both of these amazing actors. The supporting cast was perfect as well. Kudos to RDJ and his wife, Susan on their Team Downey Production Company's first major endeavor. I can't wait for more! My mother was just in town and I took her to see it as soon as she got here.

I'm trying to figure out the positive experience I could have had with this movie, and I think if you lower your expectations significantly, don't expect anything based on a trailer, actors or packaging, you might actually enjoy this as an easy-going experience. It does not deserve a high rating, but it's watchable. If you're not too allergic to the melodrama that seems confusedly infused in this picture. Photo is pretty nice though.",The Judge
351,keith2794,"""OUT"" ""STANDING"" Must Watch",9,31 December 2014,"Wheres my Bit-O-Honey old man. This is a movie that has everything that is right about the love a son has for a father, a family torn by circumstance's of life, lesson's learned with passion and love of right and wrong, of loss of loved ones, it has the glue that binds the bonds that means family. The writers and producers perfectly placed the right cast together to make one of the most heartfelt creations of a movie that I have seen in a very long time, an all star cast who all brilliantly brought life, gave birth to a touching passionately powerful script. Ask any son who has a father who was hard and very disciplinary towards a son about the struggle and resentfulness one feels and growing up to form a lost bond in the last days of his fathers life, if you are lucky enough to get that time to reconcile differences between each other just how special that is, take it from experience I have and I am sure there are others that have. This movie touched me so deeply and brought those feelings to bare, brought tears and love from deep within me. Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duval were bright as life itself in there performance, and with the supporting cast and outstanding writers, producers and directors gave life to one outstanding movie that stands out in itself and will entertain all ages and genders for years to come. Let this remind us all the importance of family bonds and that most powerful four letter word in the whole world that so many take for granted ""LOVE"". Watch this with loved ones, family, whoever that is, after all family is family no matter who it is: We as the Human Race are all Family. Award Winner!!!!!",The Judge
352,tony21487,Heartfelt and Honest,10,8 January 2015,"Such a great movie. It was an honest movie the whole way through. Very believable and easy to get lost in this movie. Wonderfully directed, superb story line, and perfect acting/casting. If you don't like this movie and it doesn't touch you in some way, than you have some bad taste in movies and no feeling. This story is about 3 boys whose father is a judge. One son is a lawyer and goes home when he hears about the death of his mother. The father and son never really got along for certain reasons that you will find out later, which is why he moved away from home. When the son is home it brings up some fond old memories and also some bad memories. The father is accused of a hit and run and the son defends him, that's all I can really say without giving anything away. This is not just a movie were everything takes place in the courtroom and drags along. It has a good beginning, middle, and a good realistic ending. You'll be happy you watched it.",The Judge

I don't much care about technical stuff at this point (even though in filmmaking technical aspects are quite important).To me, this was a film I sat through without pausing once and cried at the honesty in which it showed how family members, even when they're all each-other has, can cause one-another sadness. :)I don't think my father could sit through this film in one go lol I think it might take him a whole year to watch it, probably 10 minutes at a time; he's even more emotional than I am. lolQuite a good film, I'd say. :)",The Judge

357,marcspc,I would have liked to see a more sinister plot,5,7 June 2015,"There were good actors and good acting, but the plot line was dry as a bone. I kept thinking there was going to be a sinister twist to the plot and I even thought I had it figured out and was ready to pat myself on the back for being so clever ;) It goes something like this: Judge Joseph Palmer (Robert Duvall) was framed by Prosecutor Dwight Dickham (Billy Bob Thornton) because the long-ago defendant, Mark Blackwell (Mark Kiely) was let off his original crime with just a ""spanking"" of a sentence by Palmer. Of course, a short time after that Blackwell kills his teenage girlfriend and ended up spending the next 20 years in jail. But what I thought was going to happen next was that Hank Palmer (Robert Downey Jr.) was going to discover from a brilliant investigation (borrowing from his Sherlock Holmes skills from his other movie ^-^) that not only was Dickham Blackwell's prosecutor from his original trial, but that Blackwell's murder victim was Dickham's niece (or some other close relative). So Dickham had it in for both Palmer and Blackwell and he killed two birds with one stone (so to speak). Of course, the movie had already droned along for like 2 AND A HALF HOURS already, so it was kind of late for any such surprises.Anyhow, I didn't check the ""contains spoiler"" box, because this wasn't the actual plot (unfortunately). Can this movie even have a spoiler alert? Like I said, dry as a bone (but good acting!).So what do you think of my clever twist, eh? What's that, don't quit my day job?

Duvall is maybe a little over the top. And I'm a bit tired of those streamline versions of Rainman characters, though.

There is no slow burn with this film, it had me hooked within the fist 60 seconds and it kept me wanting more throughout.

As a negative aspect I would highlight the large number of cliches: a promising baseball player who ends his career for an injury, a man who does not visit his family in years ...
