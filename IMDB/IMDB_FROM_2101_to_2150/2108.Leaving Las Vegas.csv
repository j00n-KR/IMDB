0,MartinHafer,very realistic but horribly depressing--try to avoid it,4,9 June 2005,"This movie is one of the most realistic portrayals of the late stages of chemical dependency--complete with dry heaves, bleeding and death! Not exactly a family pic to say the least! It is so unrelentingly depressing and awful I can't recommend it to anyone except that it be shown to addicts (and their families) to show them what to expect. The hero? of the story is a man who deliberately chooses to drink and drug himself to death and that is the only real plot to the movie. Elizabeth Shue plays the clichéd part of the hooker with a heart of gold (just once I want to see a movie with a hooker who isn't some sort of social worker down deep).By the way, this movie also helped to kill the writer, as O'Brien committed suicide just after selling the movie rights. No wonder it seemed so realistic and awful!",Leaving Las Vegas
1,SnoopyStyle,two great performances,8,1 January 2016,"Hollywood screenwriter Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage) is a hopeless drunk and self-destructing. He loses his job and his family. He decides to destroy everything in his home, drive to Las Vegas and drink himself to death. He runs into call girl Sera (Elisabeth Shue) and hires her. Her abusive pimp Yuri (Julian Sands) had followed her out from L.A. He's broke and on the run from a gang. Ben and Sera begin a relationship accepting each other's flaws. However these flaws overtake them in the end.This is a movie about a drunk and a hooker with a heart of gold. Cage and Shue make this more than the simple cliché it sounds like. They infuse these characters with humanity. They give two great performances.",Leaving Las Vegas
2,Hitchcoc,The Insidiousness of Alcoholism,9,30 August 2009,"The strength of this film is that you like the people, despite their enabling and their weakness. This is one of the most realistic portrayals of this disease I've ever seen and while the movie made me crawl, it was more than effective. Nick Cage's character recognizes all that he is. He has come to terms with his self-destructiveness and warns people to stay out of his life. He has flags up everywhere. His counterpart makes the mistake of falling in love with him. She goes through the hell that every person who has a significant relationship with an alcoholic goes through. Her life is no bed of roses and so she embraces his love and companionship, but like the proverbial snake, he is still a snake: it is his nature. The acting here is superb-- the characters so real we have trouble watching them. They move through the ""normal"" world. She grows to believe that if she sticks with him, he will come around. She can't overcome the puzzle of the control that the booze has on him. To her, if she is that important to him, he will change. There's the rub. See this movie but be prepared for what it is about.",Leaving Las Vegas
3,classicsoncall,"""I came here to drink myself to death.""",7,24 June 2018,"To call Nicolas Cage's character an alcoholic would be a disservice to alcoholics everywhere. I mean, even a raging drunk has to come up for air sometimes, but Ben Sanderson (Cage) knocked down bottles of booze with the speed of The Flash, torching the memories of his past and sliding into the darkest oblivion imaginable. There's some measure of humanity in the story when Ben discovers a Las Vegas street walker named Sera (Elizabeth Shue), who offers him her love and friendship because of an ethereal connection she makes with the down and out former screenwriter. Yet even their tender moments together and the poignant background music do little to hide the fact that these two damaged souls are derelicts from the human race, and as it turns out in Ben's case, beyond saving both spiritually and bodily. The film may be of service to demonstrate how low one can go before succumbing to the depths of despondency and despair, and that there may be hope around the corner if only one were to reach out and recognize a helping hand. But this one goes in the other direction, and serves as a reminder that relentlessly abusing one's body and spirit can only end one way.",Leaving Las Vegas
4,gavin6942,"Alcoholism, Prostitution... Two Great Selling Points",7,7 April 2007,"After losing his job as a screenwriter for boozing, a man decides to move to Las Vegas and drink himself to death. But what he didn't expect was to meet Sera, a prostitute with problems of her own.This film is pretty highly acclaimed and Nicolas Cage received an Oscar for his role as the drunk. Personally, I don't know that Cage deserved the award for this one. Later on in the film his acting gets better, but the first half just seems like Cage being himself more than anything. The opening scene of him loading a shopping cart with booze is more comedic than serious. And drinking a bottle of booze as a cop drives past? Better roles he's played: ""Weather Man"", ""Lord of War"" and ""Adaptation"". This was more akin to ""Trapped in Paradise"", hardly a notable role.Elizabeth Shue, likewise, was questionable. I thought she did a much better job than Cage, but was still not a break-out role by all means. I think any number of actresses could easily have handled her role as well or better.I was also disappointed because the film has a strong anti-drinking message, but I have to say the movie really made me want to drink. I have no doubt many people have played a drinking game to this one. So, mission not accomplished.Criticisms aside, it was a good movie. I really enjoyed watching it even if I didn't think it was outstanding. The story was interesting, the characters fun, the camera-work was quite good and the Vegas scenery was spectacular. So it wasn't like it was a punishment to sit through. Cage is entertaining and Shue is quite attractive in her own way (though her most attractive role will always be in ""The Saint"").I suppose I'd say you should see this movie, but I'd ask you to decide for yourself is this deserved awards. I just didn't see it. Which, I guess, is more a complaint about the Academy than the film itself. But it put me in the wrong mindset -- expecting some mind-blowing drama and just getting a film not unlike which I've seen many times before.",Leaving Las Vegas
5,lee_eisenberg,"if solely a problem such as alcoholism can help a person find redemption, then so be it",10,7 October 2007,"Mike Figgis's ""Leaving Las Vegas"", while it pounds you in the face, also creates a sense of hope. Nicolas Cage plays Ben Sanderson, a man nearly at the end of his emotional rope who has come to Las Vegas to drink himself to death. In Las Vegas, he hooks up with prostitute Sera (Elisabeth Shue), who acts as a sort of last catharsis for him.Figgis knows how to hit the audience from the first shot: the opening scene shows Ben pushing a shopping cart down an aisle, placing liquor bottles into the cart while dancing. In other words, while he's clearly a pathetic soul, he apparently has some drive left in himself, even if it exists only as his personal escapism. Moreover, one thing that the movie makes sure to do is not portray the characters as one-dimensional: Ben is an honest man at heart but his drunkenness turns him into a nasty person, while Sera has her own demons to deal with. It also doesn't make the mistake of focusing on Las Vegas to the point of glamorizing it; the city remains the story's setting above all else.Nicolas Cage certainly deserved his Oscar for his role here, bringing out Ben's many qualities to their fullest. Shue is equally great in her role, showing Sera as someone whom we need to understand, even if we don't admire her. Also starring - and doing a very good job - are Julian Sands, Richard Lewis, Steven Weber and Carey Lowell.All in all, I wholeheartedly recommend this movie.",Leaving Las Vegas
6,jboothmillard,Leaving Las Vegas,7,12 September 2005,"This is a really good idea for a film, sometimes disturbing, but still a triumph. Ben Sanderson (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Nicolas Cage) is a Hollywood screenwriter, really depressed because he lost his career to the one thing that he can live from, alcohol. So basically the entire film has Cage's character drinking. He one day meets a prostitute, Sera (Hollow Man's Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Elisabeth Shue) who actually cares for this lover, she tells him he should stop what he is doing, but he isn't going to be stopped by anyone. The most disturbing that he does in the film is panic about having no alcohol, not just drinking it till he dies. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for Mike Figgis (also nominated the Golden Globe) and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Nicolas Cage was number 33 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!",Leaving Las Vegas
7,ccthemovieman-1,Sleaze In Stylish Form,5,9 March 2006,"I waited a long time before I saw this award-winning movie. Everything I had read about it led me to believe it was a depressing film. Most films about alcoholics aren't pretty and this was about an alcoholic AND a down-and-out hooker, so how much fun could it be?Maybe because I expected the worst, I found it a pleasant surprise. Sure, the two people weren't exactly ""winners"" in life but the movie wasn't that depressing, was it? And the film had style and good acting performances from the two leads Nicholas Cage and Elisabeth Shue, right?Yes, but ""on further review,"" as they say in the pro football telecasts, my review has changed 180 degrees. I must have had too many drinks like ""Ben"" to like this movie in first place. Hey, I am far from any prude but this is nothing but slickly-wrapped soft porn. It's Sleaze with, yes, a capital ""S."" I can't even describe half the stuff Shue described in this movie, casually discussing almost every sexual act you can think of. Maybe that's cool to critics like Ebert, who thought this was the number one movie of the year. it's just another example of the sick state of mind in the film world, from filmmakers to actors to critics, where ""pushing the envelope"" is the way to go. It started escalating with ""Midnight Cowboy"" getting the Academy Award and keeps going, through American Beauty and the sleazy films you saw nominated for this year's Best Picture.Cage won the Academy Award for Best Actor here, and I don't have a problem with that. Shue was equally as good but I found out more than one viewing is like having too many drinks - ""not good."" It's sad to see soft-porn sordidness because stylish.",Leaving Las Vegas
8,moonspinner55,"It takes its time, but ""Leaving Las Vegas"" finds its niche in the second-act...",6,14 May 2006,"Nicolas Cage won a Best Actor Oscar playing a screenwriter and miserable alcoholic who hopes to drink himself to death; Elisabeth Shue was Oscar-nominated as the Las Vegas prostitute who tries to be his surrogate guardian angel. ""Leaving Las Vegas"", an adaptation of John O'Brien's novel by writer-director Mike Figgis, is a well-produced, well-acted drama that takes a awhile to get its bearings, eventually becoming a moving human tragedy. The opening moments introducing the characters are painfully under-directed; when he has no one to ground him, Cage can be a rambling boor (even doing a little shimmy in the supermarket, he is less a character than Nicolas Cage the actor just cutting up). Shue is very moving once Figgis dispenses with her pimp, and also with his penchant for fancy directorial flourishes that don't set any particular mood. By the second hour, the pieces start falling into place and Cage gets to do some great, high-wire dramatic acting. ""Leaving Las Vegas"" takes time finding its niche but Figgis and his cast finally capture the material's essence. It's a rewarding journey. **1/2 from ****",Leaving Las Vegas
9,blanche-2,beyond bad,1,29 May 1999,"A big disappointment for what was touted as an incredible film. Incredibly bad. Very pretentious. It would be nice if just once someone would create a high profile role for a young woman that was not a prostitute. We don't really learn anything about this character, except that he seems to be a hopeless alcoholic. We don't know why. Nicholas Cage turns in an excellent performance as usual, but I feel that this role and this script let him down. And how, after not being able to perform for the whole film, can he have an erection on his deathbed? Really terrible and I felt like I needed a bath.",Leaving Las Vegas
10,Quinoa1984,Booze Blues,10,15 May 2010,"This is a heartbreaking movie. So much so that I found myself in tears at times just by the look of longing, and the sorrow knowing how futile it all is, between Ben (Nic Cage) and Sera (Elisabeth Shue). There's one such scene where they're at a food court. They seem to be in some good spirits, and Ben pulls out a little present (adorably, if just for a moment, 'magically' from behind her ear) and it's a pair of earing's. He puts them on her ear lobes and whispers something to her that is quite touching. The look between the two of them only lasts for about ten to fifteen seconds (which, in movie time, may seem long), but it speaks so much as to their twisted condition of a relationship, and how much affection Sera does feel for Ben despite everything she has to put up with with him. Still could be worse, but it certainly won't get better, not by a long shot.I get moved in a film, such as Mike Figgis' Leaving Las Vegas, when the characters have genuine feelings to one another, and, perhaps, there isn't the usual feeling that things will work out in the end. This isn't, for recent example, Crazy Heart. There's no telling really how Leaving Las Vegas will end, only that it will be in tragedy, for one or both of these souls. One is an ex-screenwriter ('ex' being at the start of the film, due to Ben's incessant drinking) who ventures to Las Vegas because he just needs to drink himself to death. Period. He's cashed his last checks, sold his car and burned his belongings. And yet Ben- via Cage's genuinely fearless performance- is not completely a down-and-out case personality wise. He can have his charms, he can be with it and hip... and other times the worst drunk you'd never want to meet at a bar or a casino.The other, Sera, is a prostitute, plain and simple, who works for a Russian fellow who treats her like s*** and, in the end, tells her to leave for good when it looks as if his own goose will be cooked by mobsters. She has little place to turn to, aside from her own turns at tricks, but she finds a connection somehow with this guy Ben. He's a genuine article, no BS, just a guy wanting to drink and to have someone to drink with (not sex, really, though the passion waxes and wanes). Figgis follows these two on this path that is inexorable. And at the same time he never asks us to really care about these people in the kind of artificial or forced way that we might get in a more ""Hollywood"" movie. Often a screenwriter will be asked when writing something ""What's the obstacles your character(s) will face in the story?"" In the case of Leaving Las Vegas, it's ""Is there anything left in the downward spiral?"" The film is a gorgeous, haunting feat of tragedy, as deep and involving as any film imaginable in the 90's (maybe not quite Schindler's List, but it's up there). The music by Figgis himself is a great jazzy mixture of tunes, sometimes with an upbeat tempo and other times the saddest music in the world (take that Guy Madden!) And the cinematography is to die for, so to speak, as he takes his 16mm stock and gets all of the moments that matter in such dark motel rooms and shiny Las Vegas nights. Hell, there's even a scene near the end, when Sera finally comes back to Ben after kicking him out, and in part it's the cinematography that makes one (or rather, me), sob like a baby. This film's got soul.As for the acting, it's almost untouchable when looking at not only that year of 1995, but the decade. Nicolas Cage has many bright spots in his career, but rarely did he give something as all-around well rounded as this in terms of playing the field emotionally. He can be funny, crazy, dour, tragic, even cute, and sometimes just the most happy-sad creature to walk the planet. You want to see why Nic Cage matters after years of trudging through Hollywood, come back to this as a reminder of what an intense guy this is. And Shue also hits it out of the park as the damaged but endearing Sera, who is earnest, kind, smart, but also knows that she, in a way like Ben, can't stop what she's started. When the two of them click on screen, you can't turn away. Last Tango in Paris comes to mind as a comparison, and even then it's not quite as passionate and moving.",Leaving Las Vegas
11,sunwarrior13,A Romantic Convergence Between An Alcoholic And A Hooker,10,19 April 2013,"Leaving Las Vegas is a romantic drama film based on a semi- autobiographical novel of the same name by John O'Brien. Nicolas Cage stars as a suicidal alcoholic who has ended his personal and professional life to drink himself to death in Las Vegas. While there, he forms a relationship with a hardened prostitute, played by Elisabeth Shue, which forms the center of the film.It is written and directed by Mike Figgis.The film tells a story of a a romantic triangle of sorts involving prostitute Sera, failed Hollywood screenwriter Ben and the constant flow of booze which he loves more dearly than life itself. Arriving in Las Vegas with the intention of drinking himself to death, Ben meets Sera, and they gradually begin falling for one another. From the outset, however, Ben warns Sera that no matter what, she can never ask him to quit drinking, a condition to which she grudgingly agrees.This charts the brief romantic convergence of two desperately needy people who together find a brief flicker of happiness. Grim yet compelling, downbeat but not really depressing, this multi- nuanced portrait of an alcoholic is easily is most accomplished and haunting picture.As far as the acting is concerned, this uniquely hypnotic and haunting love story is sparked by Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue at their career best.And most of all,it pulls no punches, takes no prisoners and flies in the face of feel-good pictures.",Leaving Las Vegas
12,hitchcockthelegend,Unconditional love in an alcoholic haze.,8,17 June 2009,"Ben Sanderson is an alcoholic, who after getting released from his well paid screen writing position, heads to Vegas with his severance pay. Where he seriously plans to drink himself to death. But whilst cruising down the strip he meets Sera, a nicely turned out prostitute, and both troubled souls come together in an unlikely romance. Based around the semi-autobiographical novel by John O'Brien, an alcoholic who committed suicide before the film made it to the screen, this is a sad, dark and deeply upsetting picture. Sanderson and his plight has no motive, we are not fed reasons for his nihilistic behaviour. We find him at the beginning of the film joyously hurtling thru a liquor market isle, promptly filling his shopping cart with bottles of liquor. From here on in we know that this is no ordinary film about an alcoholic trying to get off the booze, we are on a train to Bleakville, stops at Love and Liberation seem a very long way away. Enter Sera, the sweet and wholesome prostitute, who having escaped the abusive and borderline psycho pimp, Yuri, is herself in need of liberation. But can she carry the burden of both as this unlikely and almost certainly doomed romance starts to become significant? Nicholas Cage as Sanderson is terrific, very compelling, realistic and segueing from zany wired comedy to the desolation of Sanderson's death wish descent within a heart beat. Elisabeth Shue as Sera is also incredibly potent, if perhaps guilty of looking too pristine, and prompting questions of why she would be drawn to Ben's world anyway? Shue none the less works her socks off to make Sera sensitive and believable. Directed by Mike Figgis, who shot it beautifully in Super 16 film, the film won a Best Actor Academy Award for Cage, and garnered nominations for Best Actress {Shue} & Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay {both Figgis}. Massively popular and praised on release, it has lost none of the impact that it had back then. 8/10",Leaving Las Vegas
13,Calicodreamin,One of the worst movies I've ever seen...,2,26 February 2020,"A complete waste of two hours. What on earth is the point of this movie?

14,evanston_dad,"If Awards Were Given for Scenery Chewing, They'd Be Named for Nicolas Cage",5,8 May 2009,"A dismally depressing film about an alcoholic who travels to Las Vegas to drink himself to death and the hooker he shacks up with in his last days. I think writer/director Mike Figgis intends to amaze us with the film's frankness, but I was instead impressed by its ugliness.Nicolas Cage overacts to the gills (big surprise there) as the alcoholic, giving an even hammier performance than Ray Milland did in Billy Wilder's similarly-themed ""The Lost Weekend."" Only Wilder's film was released fifty years before this one, so what is Cage's excuse? Elisabeth Shue fairs better as the hooker, but has to endure some degrading directorial choices by Figgis, like enacting a love scene topless while Cage pours booze all over her boobs and then getting anally raped by a bunch of punks later in the film.The film is bleak, pointless and unpleasant.Grade: C",Leaving Las Vegas
15,Wuchakk,Cage terminally drunk in Las Vegas with Elisabeth Shue and lots of jazz/blues,6,13 June 2021,"An alcoholic in Los Angeles (Nicolas Cage) cashes out of the film industry and moves to Las Vegas to apparently drink himself to death. He meets a prostitute (Elisabeth Shue) with whom he has a welcome affinity and they develop a relationship of radical acceptance.""Leaving Las Vegas"" (1995) is one of those downbeat realistic dramas about lost souls in hopeless dissolution. It's well-done for what it is and Shue's beauty is effectively showcased despite the unappealing nature of her profession. And I understand the message of ""loving"" acceptance with no questions. Although it could be argued that true love refuses to enable people to destroy themselves and holds them accountable to some reasonable degree.A guy who was my best friend 20 years ago developed an alcohol problem that became increasingly glaring. He died recently, but I didn't see him for the last four years of his life because I refused to see someone drink themselves to death.The film runs 1 hour, 51 minutes, and was shot in the Los Angeles area (Burbank & Santa Monica) and Nevada (Las Vegas, Laughlin & Paradise).GRADE: B-/C+",Leaving Las Vegas
16,zetes,Best film of the 90s,10,18 July 1999,"I've never been more touched or involved by a movie relationship than by the relationship between Ben and Sera in this film. This film is a dream and it wrapped me up in its mood forever. I don't see it as being depressing. Surely some of it is, but the underlying spirit of this film lies in the main characters' unconditional love for each other. There has never been any other film where I've believed in the love more (except maybe Wings of Desire). Titanic is utterly laughable in comparison, a nightmarish teenage mentality that makes me sick to the soul. I would say that this is the only film in the 90s in my all time top ten. The performances should have both won Oscars; Susan Surandon really did not deserve hers for Dead Man Walking. She always plays the same character. Nick Cage's and Elisabeth Shue's performances are paralleled by very few.It's too bad, but I think that most people have forgotten it. I think critics are too cynical in the 90s. Yes, there are a lot of bad films, more than usual probably. It's disconcerting that most bad films aren't put out by B-movie directors (direct-to-video releases have stopped them), but by Hollywood and also the Indie filmmakers, who are truly just as bad as Hollywood in their lack of originality. Critics refuse to declare any film a masterpiece, as if there have been none this decade. Only three films have been deigned bona fide masterpieces in this decade: Schindler's List (deserved, but only declared a masterpiece because of its director, who is hardly an auteur), Pulp Fiction (deserved, but there have been many better films), and Fargo (undeserved; Siskel & Ebert made this one recognized all by themselves. Surely, it deserves recognition, but it has flaws; originality should not be the only qualifier for a masterpiece). Leaving Las Vegas appeared on many top ten lists (usually in the middle, though Roger Ebert had it as number one, though 1995 was a particularly poor year for films), but was shut out from the best Picture Oscars by such crowd pleasers as Babe and Braveheart. And Il Postino is just a Miramax joke. That is what really beat it out, because it hardly belonged at the Oscars at all.I know these comments have had little to do with the actual film. It would be really difficult to describe the power of this film. It is really an emotional experience, so you really have to see it. If you saw it and hated it, try it again. Just clear your head and let the mood absorb you. I hope it can give you a feeling similar to the one it has constantly given me since I saw it in 1995.",Leaving Las Vegas
17,Mr-Fusion,Uncompromising despair,8,2 March 2012,"Nicolas Cage deserved that Oscar. When I watch this film, I don't see Cage. I see a character who's hit rock bottom. A man so lost and alone that he's absolutely given up. Going out in a blaze of self-destructive glory. Cage is able to so convincingly portray an incurable drunk (nay, the epitome of a tragic character) that we don't see the actor. We see Ben Sanderson. It took me a while to gather my thoughts after watching ""Leaving Las Vegas"". This isn't a light and airy movie by any stretch, and demands a high tolerance for torment out of its audience. This is a portrait of hopelessness; two people on their own paths to self-destruction. And it's easy to say Nicolas Cage gives an award-winning performance, but so does Elizabeth Shue. You can't have one here without the other. This is an unbelievably hard movie, and I'm still left with a pit in my stomach just reflecting on it. But it's also a well-made one, and Mike Figgis cared enough about this to handle music, screenplay and direction. I can appreciate this for artistic expression alone, even though this holds no replay value for me. And I'd would recommend this to anyone for its performances and subtly drawn characters, provided they approach it with steel nerves. It's certainly hard to forget; which is a good thing, because I don't see myself ever coming back to this. It's just too painful.8/10",Leaving Las Vegas
18,siderite,The man who drank himself to death and the hooker who loved him,10,3 March 2014,"Leaving Las Vegas might well be the saddest film that ever was, at least for me. It is impossible to not identify with Cage's character and impossible not to love Elisabeth Shue after watching it. And really, I am not a drunk and my wife is not a hooker, yet my heart breaks every time I see this film.I think somehow, perhaps by skill or maybe by accident, the makers of this film managed to capture the very essence of man and woman, their darkest core, and present it to us raw. We have Nicholas Cage, in what I think is by far his best role, playing the man who would rather die than be overcome by desperation. We have Elisabeth Shue, playing the whore, the girl who would do anything to survive, the openly accepting woman, but inwards trying to fix the man she loves. Just send this film with the Voyager probe; aliens would actually get us.The story is pretty simple, but the intricacies of the relationship between Cage and Shue, the wonderful soundtrack, the flawless direction, they all make this a masterpiece. Cage plays a man who decided to kill himself by drinking himself to death. I found it immensely satisfying that the writer did not need to explain the reason for this. When asked, the lead character just claims he forgot why he is doing it, but he is sure he must. That's what a suicide feels like, when you don't just want death, you want oblivion, you want the negation of your existence.Shue's character, by the very definition, is an angel. She doesn't come to judge or force change. She is accepting Cage for the simplest reason of all: love. She hates it, but she does it anyway. You might think that there are a lot of love movies around, but they are actually quite a few. People who really love (and I know I sound like a pompous ass, but I actually believe this) accept the others as they are, they don't want to change them. Support them, yes, judge them, no. And that is what this hooker, the lowliest person on earth, without any moral standing at all, does. More than any primadona of romantic films.Bottom line: this film is a deeply adult movie. Children can't possibly understand it. Teens, maybe, but I don't really believe that. It is a movie about souls, not people, and it touches my soul every time I watch it. Having a strong drink or ten does help get in the mood of it, too.P.S. Julian Sands plays in this film, in a tiny role. What happened to you, man? I used to love every movie you were in!",Leaving Las Vegas
19,namashi_1,A Tour De Force Performance by Nic Cage....,9,15 April 2011,"Nicolas Cage is a Remarkable Actor, and in 'Leaving Las Vegas', He Delivers A Tour De Force Performance, that Earned Him a Very Worthy Oscar, Golden-Globe & SAG, For Best Actor! His performance as a suicidal alcoholic, deserves distinction marks. I truly believe, that this is a performance that stood out in the entire 1990's. 'Leaving Las Vegas', superbly directed by Mike Figgis, tells the story of a suicidal alcoholic, played by Cage, who has ended his personal & professional life to drink himself to death in Las Vegas. While there, he forms a strong relationship with a hardened prostitute, played by Elisabeth Shue. It's a bittersweet love-story of dependence and obsession.The Adapted Screenplay offers disturbing & courageous moments. And also manages to make memorable, well-etched, characters. Mike Figgis directs this unique tale, superbly. Cinematography, Editing, Sound Mixing, are satisfactory.My review would be incomplete if I forget to mention, Elisabeth Shue. She delivers a wonderful performance as well, and shares a striking chemistry with Nic Cage.On the whole, A must watch, for, primarily, it's lead star's powerful performance. This Is Some Fine Acting.",Leaving Las Vegas
20,StevePulaski,A realistic look at depression not motivated by a comic relief,9,28 June 2011,"I tend to give Nicolas Cage a bad reputation because within the last, maybe six years, he's done nothing but forgettable and laughably bad films. The films themselves are poor, and he is not much better. Leaving Las Vegas is for all the people that believe Nicolas Cage hasn't done a good movie. Seeing this before, but rewatching it for the first time in years I can prove that if Cage is handed the right material he can be a good actor.Cage plays Ben Sanderson, an alcoholic who recently had a crisis in his family. We see a picture of him, his son, and wife. We never exactly know why he is so upset, and the movie characters neglect to ask him any question. It could either be divorce or death. I'm going to assume death since he never hear from the wife or kid. Ben is a screenwriter, and once is alcoholism hits the breaking point, he is fired and moves to Las Vegas.His plan? Drink. Drink nonstop and ask no questions about it. Drink himself to death. He meets a hooker named Sera (Shue) who is run by her abusive pimp Yuri (Sands). If neglecting to bring home a fair amount of money Sera will be cut with a knife on her thighs. Both have their share of troubles, and Ben only seems to be calm when she's around.The film is a tragedy. This is the only role Nic Cage won an Oscar for and he's absolutely brilliant in it. Watching this in 1995, you'd probably never guess he was bound for winners like Drive Angry 3D and Ghost Rider in his future. Elisabeth Shue, who I enjoyed so much in The Trigger Effect, a hated suspense film that has a dark feel to it like this, was amazing as well and deserved the Best Actress win.The score is true Las Vegas jazz. Certain scenes with music are very well shot, and you may find yourself rewinding them just to make sure you pay attention to the actors rather than the soundtrack.The solace Ben finds in Sera is odd, but not unbelievable. Sometimes when your liver is about to give in and your head isn't on straight, the people you find comfort in are people you probably never would've looked at in your lifetime. Against all odds, Ben can get possibly one last friend out of his life before the drinking takes over.Shot on only 16mm, the high definition transfer is a little grainy, and I noticed slight audio problems. That doesn't deteriorate from the film's quality, it's just a little odd. Leaving Las Vegas is a true down-note masterpiece as it showcases realism, and Ben's drunkenness without being too comical or too over the top to believe.

I borrowed this movie from a friend and my best friend and I watched it together a couple nights ago. My friend kept saying that it was a very romantic and excellent movie. And Nicolas Cage with Elizabeth Shue? This has to be a good movie, right? This is one of the biggest downer movies I have ever seen. My best friend even walked out and wanted to stop watching it after the rape scene. I wanted to wait until the very end, hoping there was going to be in some cheesy way of ""And they lived happily ever after"". But no, it just got more and more depressing to watch. The movie is good and the story is interesting, but it's a movie I probably won't watch again, just because it is very disturbing.The title I put, I've learned something from a TV show on E!, you play a hooker in Hollywood, it's Oscar time!

In Leaving Las Vegas, love is painful and ultimately futile. This is interesting conceptually but in this case it makes for a rather uninteresting movie.In Vegas, Shue plays a hooker with really bad taste in men who is drawn to Cage, an alcoholic whose only ambition is to drink more. It's about as doomed as a relationship can get, but while I felt for Shue, who seemed lonely and vulnerable, Cage just seemed like a self-destructive, self-centered jerk, which made it hard to have much interest in his character.I came to this movie with low expectations - my ex-wife had described it as a painful, pointless movie about a guy going around Las Vegas drinking - and approached with low expectations this is an occasionally intriguing, downbeat movie, but it never grabbed me and at the end I felt rather neutral towards the experience.",Leaving Las Vegas
24,gbill-74877,Miserable,3,11 May 2021,"Elisabeth Shue is beautiful and Nicolas Cage throws himself into his part with characteristic abandon, but I'm not much of a fan of films about drug or alcohol addiction to begin with, and this one plunged in with little restraint or nuance. The relationship this alcoholic strikes up with a prostitute comes across as ludicrous to me, and as Shue's character is a prime example of the 'hooker with a heart of gold' trope, I struggled hard with the premise. The way she breathlessly talks about her instant connection to him to her therapist, soft music playing in the background, is incredibly trite. The music throughout the film is annoyingly cheesy, and director Mike Figgis makes a lot of other poor decisions in editing and telling the story, which had little genuine depth or empathy. And I hate to say it, as attractive as she is (and literally the only highlight for me), Shue doesn't seem well cast here - too wide-eyed, too loving. To its credit, the film doesn't romanticize her relationship with her pimp while it lasts, but it romanticizes the one she has with Cage. The film somehow manages to glamorize it and be bleak as hell at the same time. It's just a bad, bad, miserable film.",Leaving Las Vegas
25,g-bodyl,Dangers of Alcoholism!,9,10 August 2013,"Leaving Las Vegas is a very powerful character drama that happens to be the best acting Nicholas Cage has ever done. We are so used to his over-the-top performances, but this role is very reserved. He does play an alcohol addict, but he isn't crazy for the majority of the film and that's a relief. This film was made on a very cheap budget, but that doesn't matter when we get too involved in the story and the relationship between the two main characters.Mike Figgis's film is about a Hollywood screenwriter named Ben who loses everything thanks to his alcoholism. He decides to go to Las Vegas to literally drink himself to death and that's where he meets a prostitute, Sera. They form a relationship despite their issues and each realize they form a special bond with each other.The acting is very good. Nic Cage does a career role and his portrayal of an alcoholic is very realistic and disturbing. I'm perturbed on how much alcohol he drank in the film. Elizabeth Shue does very well as Sera and we are able to feel her pain despite her profession.Overall, this is a very surreal and realistic drama that focuses mightily on characterization. I don't like what each person does, but somehow the movie makes me feel bad for them and root for good things to happen to our main characters. Also, I really liked the look and the feel of the film. It gives out a more realistic feeling. Thanks to the raw, gritty, and powerful performances, this movie works on a high level. I rate this film 9/10.",Leaving Las Vegas
26,lesleyharris30,"Terrific Chemistry, albeit a Plot that Never Expands",6,22 April 2016,"Leaving Las Vegas is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed storyline and a stellar cast. The highlight is without a doubt Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue, Cage delivering his usual over the top acting that suits him perfectly and Shue portrays a troubled woman with pure realism, the chemistry between the two of them is top notch. However, I found the plot very thin, I understood that it was heavily revolved around these two character's relationship, but it never made enough effort to keep an actual story moving forward, any scene that was merely felt forced, like the director was really not interested. My biggest issue is that the two main characters are unlikeable, we are meant to support them without being given a reason to, Ben is a man who threw his career down the drain with alcoholism, while Sera is a prostitute who regrets the decisions she has made, I could not sympathise with them, their suffering was common sense, not a reason for me to feel supportive for these leads. It will appeal to many people and I understand how, but Leaving Las Vegas did not pull me in as I would have hoped, I would not recommend it.

27,secondtake,"The best of this is moving and genuine, but it's incomplete",7,30 October 2013,"Leaving Las Vegas (1995)In some ways a powerful movie, and very sad. It has earned a reputation for its relentlessness—the sex and the drinking both—and for the acting by both main actors, Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue. The best of this is both harrowing (the drinking is not usually fun stuff, but chugging and feeling sick stuff) and moving. There is the one main course of the main character Ben's decline as he drinks himself to death. This is at first not taken as a literal fact, but you see Ben's true (and unexplained) despondency never waver. There is also the growing relationship between Ben and the prostitute, Sera, who is more charming and undamaged than a woman in her role would probably be. (Who knows?) What starts off as a movie cliché of the whore who is actually really sweet and has a heart of gold turns into an even more unlikely girlfriend with the ability to watch her new man slowly commit suicide.But don't let reality temper your enjoyment of this downer mess. It is quite a beautiful story for the simple fact that it's so extreme, and in this outlandish hellish zone (in glittering Las Vegas) two people find a kind of true love. That's worth making a hundred movies about.No, I bought into the story despite its obvious hooks and embellishments and playing with sensation for the audience's sake (it's a very calculated movie at times). I liked it for those things, too, in a way, even if irritated by the lack of originality in treating these really common themes. What keeps the movie from quite being a classic, or a cult masterpiece (it has strains of both possibilities) is its pace. There are times when it just gets slow. I don't think it's from the style—a slow movie that creates an interesting space and lets you inhabit it and feel it is a great movie. Instead I think this lingers and runs out of plot halfway through. We don't quite know the end at the midpoint, but we know what will happen (or not happen) for close to an hour more. The subplot of a Russian pimp and his pursuers is gladly ditched by now, improbable and forced as it was. We get the best of the movie when we have just Cage and Shue.And they work. They have chemistry. They show on screen intelligence for each other, and Cage in particular gives his best performance—or best serious performance, at least (he pulls off a couple brilliant quirky comic roles elsewhere). Shue I don't know—I like her a lot here as a complement to Cage, but she never convinced me. Too nicely pretty, too easygoing, too easily duped into bad situations.But see this if you have any inclination at all. It's different enough to sustain and emotionally satisfying enough to keep you thinking afterward.",Leaving Las Vegas

I haven't seen a movie that depressed me(In a good way) this much since Million Dollar Baby, and the chemistry Cage and Shue had was phenomenal, plus Cage truly deserved his Oscar, as Shue definitely should have gotten one as well, in my opinion. It's also a brilliant tragic love story, and this is extremely well made and written as well, plus you will really feel for Cage's character trust me. The ending is very sad, but very well done,and I was seriously on the brink of tears, plus this will really leave you thinking long after you have finished watching it. I was really rooting for Cage's character to get help, and believe it or not it actually has a few humorous moments surprisingly! plus the scene where Cage flips out at the casino really got to me good. This truly should be in the top 250 in my opinion, and you will also feel plenty of sympathy for Shue's character Sera as well, plus I found it really sad how Cage's alcoholism got her and Shue kicked out of the casino and that hotel. Julian Sands plays another wonderfully bizarre character, and it's very very unpredictable throughout, plus I truly believed Ben and Sera loved each other, just all the stuff and emotion they went through together. I love Drama's so naturally I expected a masterpiece going into this, well I got that and even more, and the dialog is just brilliant, plus I can't believe they snubbed this film at the Oscars. This truly is an important movie for everyone to see, and it's obvious that cage and Shue had a lot of passion for there roles too.

The Direction is outstanding!. Mike Figgis does an outstanding job here, with brilliant camera work, giving the film a dark and depressing atmosphere, great angles, and just keeping me extremely engrossed throughout. The Acting is no doubt Oscar worthy!. Nicolas Cage is amazing as always, and gives an unforgettable performance here, you will really feel for his character, and the pain that he is going through, he truly deserved his Oscar, had phenomenal chemistry with Shue, was extremely likable, and just the stuff he did for this role just amazed me, he was so incredibly convincing that it scared me, this has to be one of the best performances I have ever seen! (Cage Rules!!!!!!!). Elisabeth Shue is amazing as always and also gives an unforgettable performance, she is incredibly gorgeous, extremely likable, incredibly sympathetic, had phenomenal chemistry with Cage, seriously deserved an Oscar, and just had so many powerful scenes with Cage, it also helps that we can really identify with her character, she was just as incredible as Cage! (Shue Rules!!!!!!!). Julian Sands played another wonderfully bizarre character here, and was awesome, but had limited screen time. Rest of the cast are fine.

30,Bored_Dragon,Counterweight to feel-good romances,9,3 May 2021,"An extreme alcoholic, who no longer remembers whether he started drinking because his wife left him or his wife left him because of alcoholism, sinks deeper into delirium, loses his job, sells all property, and goes to Vegas to drink himself to death. There he meets a prostitute and an unusual love story is born.The two enter into a relationship and start living together, fully accepting each other and their partner's life choices. He is not trying to get her out of prostitution, she is not asking him to give up drinking. They love each other as they are and live life from day to day, using that little time they have the best they can.As sad, depressing, and sick as it is, this love drama is at the same time very tender and warm, even romantic. Elisabeth Shue's quiet suffering only intensifies her sensuality, while balancing between a mentally unstable pimp (standardly good and a bit creepy Julian Sands) and perseverance to stay with Cage until the very end, without sinking with him.The opinions are very divided around Nicolas Cage. People either love him or find him very irritating. Some consider him a bad actor, while others see his qualities and attribute his bad reputation to a clumsy (or perhaps brave) choice of roles. Personally, I liked his performances even in his worst movies. But, no matter what you think of him, it is indisputable that Cage presented his life role here and, with his masterful performance, fully deserved his only Oscar.It is interesting that during the entire movie, our heroes do not have sex. Their relationship is almost platonic, which further intensifies one of, at the same time, the most morbid and the most emotionally powerful endings in the history of cinema.9/10.",Leaving Las Vegas

The script is aimless and uninteresting. The characters are poorly drawn; their motivations are never explained. Figgis' direction is self-indulgent and irritating. He has a flashy but empty visual style that would be better suited to a music video than a feature film. One has to strain to hear the dialog over the loud, inane soundtrack.

32,sol-,Loathing in Las Vegas,8,24 January 2016,"An alcoholic writer who has travelled to Vegas to drink himself to death befriends a lonely prostitute who falls in love with him in this unusual romantic drama. With atmospheric aerial shots of the neon lights of Vegas, melancholic background songs and nifty slow motion shots, 'Leaving Las Vegas' works very well as a mood piece of sorts. Lead actor Nicolas Cage lets his character's desperation shine magnificently through as well as his acceptance of the fate he has planned for himself, finding himself ""at ease"" with his situation to use his own words. Elisabeth Shue also has her fair share of strong moments too, especially as she finds herself scorned by motel proprietors and young clients who look down upon her alike. The connection between Cage and Shue never really clicks though. Certainly, she seems to like him a lot (though why remains a mystery for the most part) but he only seems to find solace in her every now and again. He is in fact so inebriated throughout that it is hard to see him as a character in love, or even potentially in love. The film feels very long at nearly two hours as too as the only factor really driving the film is the pair's up and down relationship and Shue's struggle to make enough money to support them both. 'Leaving Las Vegas' is, however, still a very powerful experience even if one does not quite buy the romance. The mood of the film, as mentioned, is absolutely unshakable and there is something quite interesting in how calm and at peace Cage seems to be after making the firm decision to drink himself to death.",Leaving Las Vegas
33,Thanos_Alfie,Best of Nicolas Cage...,7,10 December 2018,"""Leaving Las Vegas"" is a Drama - Romance movie in which we watch a man who is a well-known Hollywood screenwriter and lost everything because of his alcoholism. After he tried everything in order to hide it and continue his job, he gets fired and he organizes a new plan. His plan is to go to Las Vegas and drink himself to death. When he arrives there he meets and forms an uneasy friendship and non-interference pact with prostitute Sera.I liked this movie very much because despite the simple plot it was very interesting and it consisted of many strong and real scenes. It showed us the bad face of night jobs and what can happen in those jobs. I liked very much the interpretation of Nicolas Cage who played as Ben Sanderson the successful screenwriter with the alcoholism problem, and I believe it was his best performance until today. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Elisabeth Shue's who played as Sera a prostitute with which Ben Sanderson starts a relationship. I liked also the direction which was made by Mike Figgis and it was very interesting, presenting us the ugly truth of late-night Las Vegas and its jobs.Finally, I have to say that ""Leaving Las Vegas"" is a good movie with a decent plot and some very good interpretations. I strongly recommend everyone to watch this movie because it's a life lesson and shows us the ugly face of alcoholism and what can take from us. It also shows us what can do to the people who are around of an alcoholic person and how this influences everything in their own lives.",Leaving Las Vegas

35,eddie_baggins,An incessantly bleak drama with some strong performances,6,15 December 2020,"Long before he became a walking talking meme that is now more known for his willingness to jump on board just about any film that comes his way, Nicolas Cage was at one stage a very serious and well-regarded actor, reaching a pinnacle with his Oscar winning performance as alcoholic Hollywood screenwriter Ben Sanderson in Mike Figgis's Leaving Las Vegas.One of the most deeply depressing and bleak movies to come out of the Hollywood system in the time period of its release, Figgis's raw and confronting adaptation of John O'Brien's novel allowed Cage to go all in as the death wish seeking Sanderson, who flees the sights and sounds of Los Angeles for the casino laden streets of Las Vegas where he finds potential redemption and meaning in a relationship with Elisabeth Shue's kinder-hearted prostitute Sera.An unconventional romance in an untypical narrative, Cage and Shue are both as good as they've been in their Oscar winning and nominated roles respectively, even if its hard to know how their performances would be received in today's climate with some of Figgis's directional choices ageing poorly and Vegas's unrefined nature feeling as though its lost some of its lustre in the 25 years on from the films well received initial release that saw it become a surprise box office draw and awards darling.No doubt the film provides the now mostly irrelevant Shue with her best role before she disappeared into bit parts in mainly direct to video efforts while Cage has rarely found a more suitable character to inhabit than Ben who gives him time as both a wide eyed drunken maniac and a solemnly drawn recluse who longs for nothing more than the sweet peace of death.The two performers who virtually share most of the films screen-time between themselves are key components of the films success in keeping you engaged as the films incessantly bleak and almost light free affair makes for rough viewing throughout, viewers enjoyment being dependent on how much sorrow and sadness they can take in one sitting.You get the feeling that had Vegas been made today much would've changed about how it handles and films various tough and confronting moments but as it stands its still an important piece of the 90's cinematic puzzle, even if its awards and plaudits could be called into question as it stands.Final Say -Some would argue that Leaving Las Vegas is a career peak moment for its leading man and is undoubtedly the best work of its leading lady and director but this raw and bleak affair hasn't benefited from the time that's passed since its initial release even if its still an at times powerful examination of self-destructive souls.3 bar-tending Danny Huston's out of 5",Leaving Las Vegas
36,johnnyboyz,A Film that tears up the rule book; shreds the distinction between reality and fiction and still finds time and space to deliver a great love story.,8,18 November 2007,"The idea behind Leaving Las Vegas sounds pretty bad: an old and washed up story about someone (or two people) the audience either wont be able to relate to or wont actually like (an alcoholic and a prostitute); a relationship revolving around love that doesn't involve any sex and a film that's shot in a very bizarre way. Ingredients for a film that may sound pretty dire to the everyday film-goer but all mixed up together combined with some great acting, direction and cinematography result in Leaving Las Vegas leaving you wanting more of the same.What gripped me throughout was the way the film was shot and the way the story was told: clearly the film-makers realised that they're not going to be able to carry an hour and a half to two hour film based solely on the premise of 'a man goes to Las Vegas to drink himself to death' and thus need to space everything out in some sort of way. Also, given the fact that any hint of conflict that may arise on Sera's (Shue) behalf is gotten rid of after the first ten minutes (when her pimp tells her to leave him alone forever); I really wondered which direction the film was going to take - and so it brings me onto the ideas behind the approach. Leaving Las Vegas is shot like a mixture between a documentary, a docudrama and an out and out art film. The film carries a very grainy look; there are jump cuts to suggest a break away from 'the norm.'; there are flashbacks shot in black and white and a real all round sense of emphasis on the visual. This twinned with the fact Sera is delivering, what seems like answers to questions at various points, suggests a very alternative approach when it comes to making films. Thus, this approach feels like you're watching a documentary.The idea behind one man who has just about lost everything, with anything that he hasn't lost merely lying outside his now abandoned house for the garbage men or anyone who wants what's inside, is nothing particularly new and yet it's like using the 'one last job' idea for a crime film without actually having the protagonist be approached by anyone with a job: they must seek it out and find it themselves. Consequently, Leaving Las Vegas feels very much like a dream or a computer game where the narrative is not obvious and is not going to follow any set route: when people dream, it's down to them what you dream of likewise in computer games that have multiple angles of fulfilling a goal: it's down to the player to choose a set route and this is what Leaving Las Vegas does; it shreds the narrative idea and lets everything happen. Who could've guessed that after all the un-nerving build up involving Sera and her pimp that a mere five minutes later we would be saying goodbye to him? That's where I thought the conflict would come from. Who could've guessed that when Ben (Cage) arrives in Las Vegas, he just continues doing what he did in L.A.? Obviously the idea is 'he goes to Las Vegas to drink himself to death' but we don't know that when we're watching the film, do we.What was especially clever was the film's neo-realistic approach. We get all the obligatory Las Vegas iconography of gambling and casinos and yet the real emphasis is on real life situations and drama: thanks to this film, you get to see what happens (if you haven't already done so!) when you call a prostitute to your motel room: you get to hear what people say; see what people wear; what the surroundings might look like and how it plays out. Sometimes there are no incidents at all like in Ben's case; sometimes there are other cases where a bunch of horny kids want to video it  it's all real and unpredictable, or at least it feels like it.Something that I only realised after the film was the importance of the brief segments at random points in the film involving Sera and her 'interview' with us. We never see the interviewer and she isn't looking directly at us and yet we feel she is actually telling us the story: if she's telling us these events happened in the past, where's Ben now? Also, the focus gradually and cleverly changes from Ben and his starting of a new life in Las Vegas to Sera herself half way through the relationship  does the 'protagonist' change half way through the film? How often does that happen in Hollywood cinema? Although Ben is always drunk and Sera is a prostitute, the film doesn't promote alcoholism or prostitution, merely showing them as means of escape or survival  if Sera didn't sell herself, she'd be dead and Ben's situation is more tragic than it is funny: this is why Ben's drunken antics and speech don't make us laugh in the same way drunk people in film usually do or are usually supposed to; because it's sad to see. I think Sera learns to love Ben but Ben seems too drunk half the time to even realise or even love her back and that is the film's real tragedy.",Leaving Las Vegas
37,videorama-759-859391,"Cage will leave you, affected",8,10 June 2014,"For an actor to win a Oscar on his first nomination is impressive. But you want to watch impressive, watch Nicolas Cage in this. In my opinion it's the best and realistic performance of an alcoholic I've ever seen, at times, almost unbearably real. His objective here, is to drink himself to death, literally, like the four guys in La Grande Bouffet make a pact to eat themselves to death, and like them, this is something Cage achieves. The reason for his alcoholism, is obviously due, to the loss of his wife and child, which is never explained, which us the audience, is left to fill in the blanks. They might of just left him, cause of his drinking, I don't know, but I'm actually leaning more towards my prior analogy, where may'be too, he never drunk before their passing. Figgis and co have written a great script. The story basically has self destructing Cage, a failed scriptwriter, who gets fired from his job at at publisher script house, who at the start, is seen moseying along the aisles of the liquor story, filling his trolley with a surplus of booze. He travels to Lost, sorry Las Vegas, or I should say Last Vegas, to carry his slow suicide out, where he inadvertently falls in love with a high class call girl (Shue, who really impresses too). She too has been living in a world of pain, dependent on her loser of a brutal pimp, Sands, would you believe, where his fate is cut short. LLV is initially a love story, the story moving at it's own cool and casual, if sleek pace, carried off beautifully by it's two performers. Cage and Shue make a mutual decision, regarding each other vices, where it comes to a point, where Shue can't stay true, to not deterring Cage to give up the bottle. Much like the film Lenny, we have Shue's character talking to a doctor in the after of Cage's death, intermittently throughout the film, where Cage's brilliant rightfully winning performance will linger with you. One scene with Shue getting gang banged by some late teens in a hotel room, which leads to a rape and beating, I must admit was a bit of a hard watch.",Leaving Las Vegas
38,FiendishDramaturgy,Beautifully tragic performances bolster this otherwise sad and irredeemable screenplay.,6,4 June 2007,"Beautifully tragic performances bolster this otherwise sad and irredeemable screenplay. This is probably one of the best (and most disturbing) performances to come out of Cage before, or since. I generally enjoy his movies, but this individual performance tops them all, in my opinion.The screenplay is disturbing, in that it aptly and tragically, depicts the life of an alcoholic, and the woman who enables him. Frankly, it was done so well, I had little interest in a first viewing, and no interest in subsequent viewings. The irredeemability factor enters when one realizes that this work does not attempt to uplift, entertain, or teach, but rather focuses on the addictive behaviors of a full-blown alcoholic.Life's just too short. If you've never lived with an alcoholic in the house, then this would be educational. If you're living in a fantasy world, where your life has never been touched by a chronic alcoholic, then you may derive some measure of entertainment from this film. Me? I was just saddened by the work, itself.All in all, this is worth viewing if only to enjoy Cage's ""breakthrough"" performance.

Such a premise for a story seems contrived, but in this movie its believable. The drunk, played by Nicholas Cage, and the whore, played by Elisabeth Shue, do not come off as caricatures. As a result, the story is engaging. These two characters are worth caring about. They are troubled, needy, alone, angry, yet form an attachment that is the basis of the story. Setting the story in Las Vegas gives the story an even more austere quality. The lights of the strip are in stark contrast to the darkness and gloominess of their lives. Now, the movie also includes a third ""character"", alcohol. This movie captures the ugliness and destructiveness of drinking. As Ben keeps drinking his behavior gets more erratic. This drives Sera to do even more whoring. Although they assured each other that they were okay with the respective drinking and whoring, it soon becomes apparent that both are deeply bothered and hurt by what the other is doing and want them to stop.

41,Lechuguilla,A Sad Journey,6,5 November 2017,"In this intense character study of a twenty something alcoholic and a prostitute, Nicolas Cage plays Ben Sanderson, a lonely failed screenwriter who travels from Hollywood to Las Vegas to end his life by drinking himself to death. Elisabeth Shue plays the prostitute, the only person in Vegas who shows any compassion toward Ben. It's a depressing movie.The simple, thought provoking story gives us a journey of two lost souls who find each other, share their experiences, anguished and hurting as they are, adrift in a cold, uncaring world. We feel for these two people; we root for them. Yet, despite how physically attractive both are, their situation is dire.It's hard to imagine a guy like Ben on such a trajectory. How can someone be so lacking both in self-knowledge and interpersonal relations; ditto Shue's character? I would have preferred that the scriptwriter make these two people a bit more complex, and allow Ben to make some attempt to change course.As such the script is a tad manipulative. Viewers are supposed to come away with a specific message about loneliness and alcoholism. But the plot is too heavy handed, the message totally not subtle, and the overall story not realistic. Also, I did not like the Yuri subplot. In addition, the plot is repetitive. We see Ben's same behavior, in different settings, over and over and over.Casting is acceptable; acting is quite good, especially Cage and Shue in the lead roles. High contrast lighting implies a subtle neo-noir quality. And as we would expect in a character study, there are a lot of closeup camera shots. Background music trends toward blues and what I would describe as sad jazz; music is a bit too loud in some scenes.""Leaving Las Vegas"" is a serious character study wrapped in Hollywood glitter, which only amplifies the mood of fatalism and desperation. For technical quality the film is quite good. But viewers need to understand that there is almost no humor and precious little entertainment here. The background music at the end is appropriate ... a soft, sad piano dirge.",Leaving Las Vegas
42,arthur_tafero,Solid Successor to Lost Weekend,6,17 November 2018,"Leaving Los Vegas refers to leaving the only way you can if you are a chronic, self-destructive alcoholic; drinking yourself to death. This dysfunctional person is joined by another dysfunctional person, a prostitute who shares a similar desire for self-destruction. Only the alcoholic is getting the job done faster. I would expect the same end for the prostitute; a premature death via a violent client or terrible disease, but that is not the point of the film. Figgis does a great job of showing two desperate people meeting each other in the heat of personal crisis. They cling to each other desperately because they have no other options. This film is far more depressing than Lost Weekend, which has a happy ending, but in many ways, is far more realistic than Lost Weekend. Nick Cage and Elizabeth Shue have dynamic chemistry and do a great job, and the screenplay is honest to a fault. Difficult to watch, but excellent filmmaking.",Leaving Las Vegas
43,Nazi_Fighter_David,The chemistry between Cage and Shue is sizzling...,10,27 June 2002,"Mike Figgis directed beautifully 'Leaving Las Vegas'... His film resulted audacious, fiercely realistic... Hollywood had great success with movies about alcoholism: ""The Lost Weekend"" which won four Academy Awards, including Best Actor for Ray Milland and ""Days of Wine and Roses,"" depicting Jack Lemmon as a charming drunk who loses his job because of this, and brings his wife (Lee Remick) down with him...In 'Leaving Las Vegas,' Figgis captures the chaos inside an alcoholic divorcée... He shows the complexity of life and human relationships... He invites us to use our imaginations about a suicidal alcoholic... He never really explained how his character is bent on killing himself, nevertheless his powerful message remains a very sad one, extremely difficult to embrace... The final scene in a dark, filthy motel room rank as some of the most heartbreaking moments I have ever seen in film, and surely it will leave you terribly moved... Figgis treats his two leading characters tenderly... He never makes moral pronouncements, and to his credit, the film remains honest to the end, never sinking into sentimentality...His style as his story remembers me Marco Ferreri's greatest international success, 'La Grande Bouffe' (Blow-Out), a black and highly flatulent comedy (that won the Grand Jury prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1973) about four middle-aged men who gather in a well-appointed villa to eat themselves to death...'Leaving Las Vegas' is the depressing love story of a failed drunken writer and a self-assured $500-a-night young hooker with whom he crosses paths... It is an appeasing tale of a dedicated drunk who downs entire bottles of hard liquor in several gulps... He is on the way down and he recognizes it... He is an ecumenical drinker who wants to destroy everything that remains of his old life... He fills his supermarket jumbo cart with as much booze as possible, and moves for Vegas to literally drink himself to death... Nicolas Cage is remarkable as Ben Sanderson, the alcoholic who is resolute and actually thoughtful about his self-destruction..Ben admits he has nothing to live for and he wants to die... He swills vodka from the bottle in the shower... He drinks greedily at the bottom of a swimming pool... He drinks, and drinks, 'til there's no more... And when he discovers that the Casino does not offer the Bloody Mary's that he asks, he explodes, overturning the table of Blackjack where he was gambling... He wakes up at night shaking so much he can merely crawl to the refrigerator and intensely swallows Vodka mixed with a little orange juice... Elisabeth Shue proves to be a revelation as Sera.. A polite, beautiful, and sensitive blonde woman who prides herself on being just a high-class call girl... Nevertheless her vulnerable character is very puzzling for her terrible lifestyle, and her strange desperate attachment to a sadistic pimp Yuri Butso... Sera meets Ben and inexplicably finds herself attracted to him... She soon develop a rich closeness that can nearly be described as love... Ben continues to tell her that true love between them could never happen... After Yuri is soon out of the way by Russian thugs, she takes Ben under her wing, and attempts to fill a need in her life much like Ben fills his needs with liquor... Both share a common bond of misery and loneliness... Sera cares for Ben enough to handle his drunken bouts of coldness... She complies to Ben's own terms and vows to never dissuade him from his suicidal goal... Out of sheer love, she even buys him a silver flask for a present, while, inside, she is desperate to find some way to change his course as well as her own... In one of the most revealing scenes at a desert resort, she drowns herself in sunlight and liquor to seduce Ben... She tries to love him, and in his infrequent getaways of semi-sobriety, he attempts to love her back... The opportunity is shattered as Ben, without an ability or desire to change, becomes for her a tragic portrait of life without hope... How foolish of her to push him to select...Shue keeps, all the way, an intriguing character extremely human... She is good and tender... Never tough or cynical... Her observations, without dialog, suggest just a sliver of expectation... In the final outcome, this dream hooker is the heart of the story... The Academy showed their appreciation by giving her a best actress nomination...""Leaving Las Vegas"" is pain, isolation and honesty... An unusual picture of human desperation and impotency... A study of acceptance, resignation and despair of an amazing two characters... An examination of what happens when two lovers are caught in cycles of self-destruction... The film is extremely well written, directed and acted... The chemistry between Cage and Shue is sizzling... They are able to solve their existential frustrations by connecting in perfect harmony, and yet they are still completely alone... 'Leaving Las Vegas' has some film noir feel by moments, specially during the dark alleyways and hookers, where its neon signs are seedy, its nights perpetual, and the glitter absent... Figgis' camera moves as fluidly as the alcohol guzzles bottle after bottle down Cage's throat... The music adds plenty to the motion picture with ballads playing a large role in the odd romance... Like Chaplin and Woody Allen, Figgis molds his movie by using his own music...In an ironic twist of events, the book's author John O'Brien actually committed suicide in 1994, two weeks after selling the movie rights... He never got to see his vision realized on the screen... Director, Mike Figgis finished the film as a tribute...",Leaving Las Vegas
44,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Hypnotic, haunting, lingers with you long after",9,10 March 2016,"Upon my first ever viewing (I know) of Mike Figgis's Leaving Las Vegas last night, I discovered that it's not the film I thought it was all these years. I had an image of a quirky, star crossed lovers tale with a modicum of sweetness. What I got wasn't insanely far off the mark, but I have to say I was disarmed and deeply affected by the sense of decaying bitterness which prevails throughout the story and hangs over it like the sour, neon stained moon over a feverish, perpetually nocturnal Vegas. Every character besides the two leads sort of flits dimly in and out of the story, never having any impact further than they need to service the plot with. This leaves Nicolas Cage and Elizabeth Shue eerily alienated and gives the movie a hypnotic flair. Even though these two abide in a bustling setting, it oddly seems at times that they are the only two human beings in existence. That also most likely stems from the film's willingness to take the time to get to know them, lingering on every glance, murmur and mannerism, be it mundane or essential, to try and get a feel for these two completely broken souls. Cage is Ben, a failing Hollywood screenwriter who is quite literally drowning in alcoholism, plagued by some tragic past of which we never learn about. He is fired and splits for Vegas to hole up in a motel and deliberately drink himself to death. There he meets Sera (Shue) a hooker with a heart of gold (Shue torches the cliché bravely). They are immediately attracted, and begin a relationship. She continues to see Johns, after being freed of her sadistic Latvian pimp (Julian Sands, terrifying). He makes her promise to not attempt to stop his drinking. Their romance is born out of the primal loneliness that each human being feels to a certain extent, that instinctual urge to reach out and grab for anything, anyone to put out the pain. Cage is everything in the role: pathetic, charming, sad, manic, desperate and deeply, scarily committed to his lethal quest of inebriation. The scenes of liquor consumption in this film go beyond excess and make Denzel in Flight look like a high schooler. It will make many uncomfortable, but looking away for our own peace of mind takes away from the urgency and dark poetry of Cage's situation. Booze is a low burn, but it's still suicide, and an agonizing method for anyone to behold in action: the person has an extended period of time to rethink, reevaluate, and if they don't, then their resolve is extended and far more disturbing than a split second decision. Cage displays this in harrowing form in a career highlight. Elizabeth Shue is heartbreaking as the girl who loves him but can't quite say why, a girl who has spent years in loveless copulation, confused and torn upon feeling it for the first time. Her character goes through some truly hellish things here. You will cry for her, fall in love with her alongside Cage and swell with admiration at her steely resilience in the face of some of the ugliest things life has to offer her. Each member of the supporting cast is like a star in the desert sky, a moment of flickering purpose before fading into the background again to let Cage and Shue continue their dance of the damned. Graham Beckel as a shaken bartender, Xander Berkeley as a cynical cab driver, Valeria Golino as as a Barfly and R. Lee Ermey as a taken aback conventioneer are all perfect. Director Mike Figgis composed the score himself, a moody blues melody that clings to your perception after the film like a dream that won't let go. Just to make the film more haunting, it's based on a novel by a severely alcoholic writer who took his own life two weeks after production was underway, furthering the disconcerting vibe to a saturation point. This one is a tough watch, and you'll be forced to see two human beings at the absolute end of the road, miles past rock bottom with seemingly no hope in sight. And yet, if you are patient and try to empathize, you will see the kind of flickering positivity and briefly life -affirming intimacy and light that humans cling to even in the darkest of times. Cage and Shue beautifully paint a bittersweet portrait of this through their work. It's overbearing with the better, but that makes the sweet all the more precious and lasting. Just watch something happy after.",Leaving Las Vegas

A hooker falls in love for him because of his charm? No matter how bad he's doing the hooker is still in love with him for whatever reasons and pays all his bills and living. The man's only purpose is to drink and cause drama, since hooker doesn't like him drinking. The storyline is beyond poor. Great acting does not make this a good movie. Everythings too forced.",Leaving Las Vegas
46,I_Ailurophile,A jewel of cinema as essential as it is melancholy,10,14 November 2021,"The entire history of Nicolas Cage's career is a swirling miasma of radical overacting, deeply subdued portrayals, and moments where he has struck a balance. At just the right moment, in just the right role, Cage can be absolutely brilliant, and 'Leaving Las Vegas' is unquestionably one of those moments. Ben Sanderson is a mess of a human being on the verge of self-destruction, and Cage masterfully maneuvers every drunken stumble, line of slurred speech and twisted tangle of emotion. He commands astonishing physicality and range in his performance while wholly embodying the terrible trajectory of Ben's days, and it's both a marvel and a delight as a viewer. This is hardly to count out Elisabeth Shue, though, demonstrating in the role of Sera acting abilities that rival the very best of cinema. She bears the superb range and poise to inhabit the immense jumble of love, compassion, loneliness, and hurt of the woman; to every extent that Cage deserved his accolades here, I find it incredible that Shue wasn't also awarded more.By no means is 'Leaving Las Vegas' an easy movie to watch; one has to be in a very particular mood to engage with a picture so inevitably tragic and downtrodden. But this would be an essential must-see for Cage and Shue alone, nevermind the exquisite writing and direction that makes this the masterpiece it is. The characterizations and dialogue are exemplars of cinema, dazzlingly complex and penned with utmost care. The narrative as a whole, and the scene writing, is as momentous and absorbing as it is bleak and heartbreaking. I can't speak to John O'Brien's novel, but in his adapted, screenplay, and his keen eye and guiding hand as director, Mike Figgis has created what was an instant classic in 1995, and today is no less indispensable a treasure. The technical craft is no less refined, including some great use of lighting; the supporting cast is outstanding, all giving excellent performances exceeding the scope of their roles. And between the handpicked popular songs that round out the soundtrack, and still more so the original score that Figgis himself composed, the music is a fantastic complement to every (down)turn in the story laid before us. Why, all the constituent parts come together for what may well be the most heartrending love scene in all of cinema, and that such a seemingly contradictory concept could be realized to such astounding success alone says so much about the extremely high caliber at which everyone involved is operating.To speak at greater length or detail would begin to betray narrative points, and I'd only be repeating myself. I had tall expectations when I began watching, and still I was utterly blown away by the profound finesse with which such a tawdry, dispiriting tale was brought to life. Mike Figgis, Nicolas Cage, Elisabeth Shue, and every other member of the cast and crew have in 'Leaving Las Vegas' a monumental achievement to claim for the rest of their careers and lives. The subject matter and story marks this as a feature that not everyone will be able to appreciate, but it's so impeccable and striking in every aspect of its craft that I'd be terribly remiss not to offer a blanket recommendation. So long as the content suggested by the basic premise isn't too off-putting for a given viewer, this is a must-see for all comers, and that's all there is to it.",Leaving Las Vegas
47,MarieGabrielle,Story within a story...,9,31 December 2006,"Agreed, this is a story that has more depth than you may see at first viewing. Nicolas Cage, a man who gets fired from his screen writing job in Los Angeles, and takes off to Las Vegas. Unrelenting and alcoholic, he checks into the 'Whole Year In' (""hole you're in"").Julian Sands is Yuri, the pimp who controls (at first) Elisabeth Shue (Sera). Shue is very good in this role. Mixed up and sympathetic, she seems lost.She gravitates toward Cage, after they spend some time together she invites him to stay at her apartment. There are many effective scenes where we see the chaos at night, frenetic tourism, commercialism. Figgis has done a good job portraying the random alienation these people live in. Sera with self-destructive relationships, Ben with his alcoholism.There is more than just the basic theme here, it is an effective character study of two people, randomly looking for something. There are a few scenes with Shue at her therapist, which are reminiscent of ""Klute"" with Jane Fonda. The scenes reflect not the hooker with a heart of gold cliché, but a real person damaged and broken by her experiences.This is an excellent film worth more than one viewing as it does not glamorize or parody the lives of these people. Cage in particular is very effective, have not seen him in a similarly good role since. 9/10.",Leaving Las Vegas

49,Samiam3,"Chracterization needs a few touches, but it's still strong and credible",7,19 November 2010,"I liked, Leaving Las Vegas, but I didn't love it. It's a sad story, almost a tear jerker, but not quite....Why? the answer comes when you consider who it is we are crying for. Leaving Las Vegas is about a lonely man who slowly drinks himself to death having just gotten in a relationship with a prostitute in Vegas. She is lonely too, and is desperate to clean him up, even though she can barely clean up herself.My problem with Leaving Las Vegas is that I never come to know Cage's character as well as I would've liked to. The introduction feels heavy handed, and from there on, Cage does more drinking than he does talking. Indeed he plays drunk well, but he doesn't play human very well (save a few moments). I would have liked it had the movie been about Elisabeth Shue. There is a sense that her story involves more, and she sells it to us far more effectively than Cage. The result is a movie that sort of goes back and forth from being close to being distant.Between Showgirls and this, one could argue that 1995 is the year which made Vegas look degrading. Despite all the bright lights and colours, Leaving Las Vegas does a very good job of capturing something more dark about the city. For a start, it is shot with a very grainy, high contrast film stock. A lot of the interior scenes are shot with a slower film speed, as if the camera is dying. Is Vegas a dream or a nightmare? Secondly, nobody in town looks all that pleasant towards you when you are a drunk or a hooker.For the most part, Leaving Las Vegas is strait forward. I left Las Vegas never fully understanding who I went there with, but that doesn't mean I didn't feel anything.",Leaving Las Vegas

You won't forget this movie or the brilliant performances in a hurry.,9,13 August 2003,"This is a very tough film to watch, but it features some of the most quality acting I've ever seen, with absolutely amazing performances by Nick Cage and Elizabeth Shue. The movie is very heavy and won't leave you with a smile on your face but is a must see.The movie is about 2 people(played by Nick Cage and Elizabeth Shue) one a hooker the other an alcoholic. Both live on the dark side of life, this film deals with their struggles to find something better. This is a superb and important film but I too wouldn't recommend it to anyone under 18. Definitely deserving of all the praise it got and will stay with you, Cage and Shue are both flawless. There are more touching moments in this film then I can even recall right now but I will say:SPOILER: The whole thing with Shue pouring the alcohol over herself is quite powerful. Shue is an extraordinary actress-I want to see more of her!I'm not sure about seeing this movie a second time, it's pretty disturbing and doesn't make me want to see it in multiple viewings but there's no doubt that this is an absolutely superb film and one of Cage's best if not his best, acting role. 9 out of 10 for the movie and 10 out of 10 for the acting.",Leaving Las Vegas
51,Movie-ManDan,A Must See. A Must Experience.,10,19 September 2014,"This movie is, without question, one of the best I have ever seen. Everything that makes a good movie is here and done very, very well. However, this is not an easy film to watch. The whole movie deals with suicide, love, prostitution, acceptance, alcoholism and abuse. But the way that everything is done is sure to impress the viewer and leave a lasting impact.Nicolas Cage plays Hollywood screenwriter, Ben Sanderson, whose wife and kid leave him due to his alcohol abuse. His abuse grows, costing him his job too. With nothing to lose, he trashes everything of his from Hollywood and heads to Las Vegas to drink himself to death. There, he meets a career hooker named Sera (Shue). Sera have endured abuse and scorn from her pimp, Yuri (Sands) and her clients. Their relationship is mostly of acceptance. Ben just wants a confidant, someone to be with. They don't ask one another to change who they are, but Sera is torn between her loyalty to Ben and wanting him out of his suicidal state.Nicolas Cage is one of the most hated celebrities out there, due to his recent string of bad movies and over-the-top acting. But in this, he was phenomenal. Playing a drunk may sound easy to do and funny to watch, but Cage plays a serious drunk that can make a viewer cry. In my list of ""Greatest Acting Performances of All Time,"" I rank Cage as Ben Sanderson at number 12. Any aspiring actor needs to see him in this. Then, there is Elizabeth Shue, one of the most underrated actresses ever. Her portrayal in this is about up to par with Cage. These two are the only characters to be focused on, everybody else is very brief. So the chemistry and character development is very strong. They drive this film and trigger almost every kind of emotion you have. The whole idea of Ben and Sera leading such terrible lives and ending up awful situations is very hard for some to handle, but the whole idea about acceptance and people's true selves really have a lasting impact on everyone that sees it.4/4",Leaving Las Vegas

If it wanted to be romance, it failed. If wanted to be a drama, it failed even more, given the weak plot it has. This film is very boring until the last half hour, there's nothing much interesting to see or expect for the poor story. Also, it never gets close to have a climax, since there's not enough development to engage the spectator. Nicolas Cage was still a good actor when made this picture, but sadly his talent was wasted in this weak piece of work. Don't get me wrong, I don't think it's one of the worst films ever, but the subjects involved in this movie should be much more developed. I admit there are some few good scenes, for instance the cassino's argument with the waitress, but it wasn't enough to save the whole thing.

Elisabeth Shue is gorgeous, a little too gorgeous for a hooker, but her hard line/masochistic interpretation pulls it off. Her outfits could drape a People's worst-dressed of the year... Cage overacts but has charisma. Shue shows off her muscles, etc. If you want to know what an actress does between flicks today: she works out. Shue has a beautiful butt and they show it. The documentary-cum-stream of consciousness naturalistic style is a nice break from a story well-told, but don't push it, Figgs; it could get old.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

54,Howlin Wolf,"It's easy to describe it in just one word: ""Haunting""",9,23 February 2001,"A quick response to a couple of comments I read first:   (1)  Mike Figgis is not ""unable"" or ""uninterested"" in exploring such issues as why Ben feels compelled to reach out to Sera etc.  He simply prefers to let the material he has filmed speak for itself, thereby hopefully stimulating his audience into attempting to theorise such matters for themselves.  He has no wish to 'spoonfeed' us.  (Sorry if I sound presumptuous about the director's intentions but it's something I feel.)  I believe we are only entitled to gripe about what we are shown in a film, not what is left out, unless what is omitted means the movie is incomprehensible.  Not the case here.  (2)  Something to the effect of:  ""Any actor can portray an alcoholic convincingly...""  I cannot tell you how virulently I disagree with this opinion.  It is true that the Academy tends to favour ""Person in peril/"""" disadvantaged"" roles, but is this the fault of the actor who plays them? No.  Cage was stunning in what must have been an unbelievably demanding role and he deserved to walk off with the Oscar.  A challenge to IMDB users: Name me five Hollywood actors who could've played the role better.  I look forward to reading any e-mails I may receive. (Always assuming anyone reads this, of course...!)   The film itself:  Two main performances were nigh-on faultless.  Use of Julian Sands was confusing, though.  (MINI-SPOILER)  If they were going to move away from his character so soon, then why include the few well-written scenes showing how much of a psycho he was?  Still, mustn't complain when a movie is well-written...   Great soundtrack, and the use of fades combined with the glitzy Vegas atmosphere drew me into the movie along with the performances.   A film that I admire because it stubbornly refuses to glamorise or undermine the realities of alcohol addiction.  Genuinely moving, this is one of the most intelligent love stories and most realistic movies I have ever seen.  Bravo to all concerned!",Leaving Las Vegas
55,Screen_Blitz,Nicolas Cage at one of his most phenomenal performances,8,21 September 2016,"Alcohol addiction is the dangerous feat, and films with gloomy character studies like these can be difficult to sit through and hit too close to home, particularly those who have a family member dealing with a similar problem. This film directed by Mile Figgis however, is about something more than alcoholism. It is a romantic story between a man who's alcoholism becomes a primary treatment for his dominating depression, and a woman who becomes his last light of levity before he lets his depression consume him; and this film doesn't come without phenomenal performances by it's spellbinding leads who tug at the heart strings almost every chance they get. Based on the novel by John O'Brien who at the age of 34 allegedly shot himself around the time Mike Figgis launch this film on production, this drama piece stars Nicolas Cage as a former Los Angelos screenwriter Ben Sanderson who's alcohol addiction costs him his wife, his son, and eventually his job in Hollywood. With his plunged to rock-bottom, Ben decides he has no way of moving on anymore. In response, he leaves everything behind in his Los Angelos home and moves to an apartment in Las Vegas with a large array of booze to do one last thing: drink himself to death. Unexpectedly along the way, he meets sexy prostitute Sera (played by Elizabeth Shue) who has problems of her own, she is stuck in relationship with a manipulative pimp named Yuri (played by Julian Sands). But once he severs ties with him, she finds herself suddenly involved with a relationship with Ben.From beginning to end, this film is certainly not your average love story between with a man and a woman with different critical backgrounds. In fact, almost every common trope in the romantic genre is thrown out the window in favor for a more intelligent, riveting, but nonetheless deeply depressing romantic tale. This one is definitely not an easy one to sit through as the story centers on a man who's lost all hope in life and bargains in on alcoholism as a therapeutic practice for his clinically depressed state, and the film pervades this with a gloomy atmosphere. In the midst of this, it also provides a sense of hope when the main character touches ties with a young prostitute who he unexpectedly finds as his source of conformity. Soon, the relationship that forms between the two serves as the emotional core of the story. It's smart, it's realistic, and it never tries to go for the melodramatic route but instead lets its emotional resonance run naturally; and with the riveting performances by both Nicolas Cage and Elizabeth Shue motivating the gravity of the story, the results in a powerful, of poignant romantic tale. Though the gloomy atmosphere is enough to turn some viewers away as there is rarely moments of levity and the amount of humor is as scarce as water in a desert, but the great level of nuance and the irony of how Sera never makes a desperate attempt to stop Ben from drinking himself to death simply because of her love to fulfill his desires before he ends his life make this a film with great admiration. Leaving Las Vegas is a powerful, potent romantic piece complete with a phenomenal performance by Nicolas Cage and co-star Elizabeth Shue, and Mike Figgis's successful direction on bringing John O'Brien's memoir to the silver screen. It's a smart, riveting drama best recommended for fans of Nicolas Cage, but in the other hand should only be watched once as the overall depressing atmosphere of this film more than likely destined to be a difficult for first viewing, let alone a replay.",Leaving Las Vegas

57,bobsgrock,A stark and depressing portrayal of the failure of love.,8,3 September 2008,"Leaving Las Vegas is a great film, but not for the reasons most associated with it. Yes, the acting is very good with Nicolas Cage giving one of the best performances I have ever seen on film and Elisabeth Shue playing it very straight and hard as a seen-it-all prostitute. However, it is the simple story about two people that come to meet each other in the harsh, loud, nonstop environment of Las Vegas and form a relationship unlike any other in the movies.Ben is an alcoholic, pure and simple. He knows and accepts that fact and indeed has come to Las Vegas to drink himself to death. When he meets Sera, they realize about the only thing they have in common is that they are both lonely. Still, being with each other isn't enough for them. Thus, while they are together, Ben must continue to drink and Sera continues to walk the streets.This is not an easy film to watch, but after watching it twice I have a better understanding of why people do self-destructive things and will not stop. Ben cannot stop drinking not only because his body won't let him but also because he has no other way to try and alleviate the pain and hurt he has gone through. Sera won't stop because of money and because Ben is not an able partner in his condition.This movie is extraordinary because it shows that love does not always win. Sometimes, the pain and suffering overtakes the love two people have for each other. And while Ben and Sera did love each other, it was almost inevitable that this end in tragedy. See it, but only if you have a strong stomach for a depressing and moving tragic love story.",Leaving Las Vegas
58,mstomaso,The dignity of love and the depths of despair,9,3 June 2005,"If Mike Figgis never made another film, and Nick Cage and Elizabeth Shue retired after making Leaving Las Vegas, they would have done so with impunity. Both actors are superb, and bring the excellent screenplay to life with the help of some masterful dramatic cinematography.Cage plays a suicidal alcoholic who has come to Las Vegas to drink himself to death, and Shue plays the unexpected problem - a prostitute who falls in love with him. The only reason this film did not receive a ten from me is the voice-over technique which was tastefully minimal, but, in my opinion, the only mistake the director made. It does help to provide closure, but I felt that closure was an unnecessary compromise here.This is not an entertaining film, and in truth, I am surprised by its popularity among typical audiences. It is a serious film, and a work of art, but fun is not to be found here. DO NOT see this film if you dislike feeling emotionally drained and ethically challenged, and DO NOT see it if you are very prone to boredom, or easily offended by sexual violence, substance abuse and the horror of daily life on the street. This is an intensely sad film about love shared by people who are caught in the gravity of their lives and can not escape. It is also a story of redemption and respect, found in improbable places. It is NOT a fun-filled frolicking romantic comedy, but rather, the opposite, and it achieves a beauty, dignity and power almost unique among films treating such starkly real and disturbing subjects.",Leaving Las Vegas

Leaving Las Vegas would be a perfect choice for a first date film over anything that Meg Ryan or the recycle bin of Hollywood has to offer. It is a gripping story of realistic love, and the dramatic consequences of giving your heart to someone. It is about dreams, companionship, and the hurdles of everyday romance. This is a film that proves that the darker underbelly of our society still has a shimmering light of hope and love. Director Mike Figgis has done an outstanding job of giving these two rich characters the right elements to build upon the ""classic"" love-story moments, while giving it a flavor uniquely his own. Figgis' mixture of gritty Vegas with the beautiful jazz sounds really created the ambiance of love and pushed these two ugly ducklings closer towards their transformation into love. I think that is what really captured me on this film, was that it was similar to the love stories that Hollywood continually releases, except it gave us two tragic characters instead of these bubbly, money isn't everything, characters that seem to be repetitive cogs in the Hollywood machine.Let me explain this further. When you think of a love story, what are the elements that you consider? You have a guy and a girl (normally), they have this coincidental moment where they find their common bond, they are held back by either an internal or external dilemma, there is a factor of insecurity, and finally the dramatic ending where the two rush together at a predisclosed location (normally an airport). Does that sound familiar in any way? These are all elements that you can find in LLV. I have seen this film at least a dozen times, and for some odd reason it was this viewing that it just seemed to click for me. This is the perfect American love story told with a darker tone. While most will see this as nothing more than the story of a drunk trying to kill himself and a graphic scenes with a prostitute, I saw it as the classic story of love. All the elements are present. Ben and Sera coincidentally meet one night, both seeking companionship and without the pressures of sex, they immediately form this bond that will never be broken. Through Ben's drunkenness, he remembers her and continually wants to see her. They both have internal factors that hold them back, Sera's is prostitution while Ben's is his drinking. Even through there are these factors, they still find themselves together. That feeling of insecurity is even there when Sera arrives home one night to find Ben with someone else. It all seems to fit. Then there is the amazing ending that will either have you in rapture or in awe. These two are in love, and it isn't this bubbly love between Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, it is truths of America finding the dream of compassion.The only unnecessary moments that I felt could have been fine-tuned were those involving Julian Sans. I just couldn't capture his character. I needed a bit more back-story or perhaps more interactions between him and Sera. Something was missing that distracted from the scenes that they shared. Outside of this one element, the rest of the film was purely flawless and even at times carnal. For example, when Sera has the opportunity to be on her own, she chooses to forgo her independence and be with Ben. Shue and Figgis both demonstrate that perhaps Sera is not in love with Ben, but instead the concept of a man wanting to be with her because of who she is. It is obvious that Sera seeks companionship, and probably has never had it all her life, when suddenly Ben struts into the picture. This may explain why she continues to work when she doesn't have to. She is used to the job, she thrives for the intensity, and perhaps uses it to fall deeper in love with Ben. Figgis doesn't come out and give you a reason why Sera continues along her path, but instead leaves it up to your imagination and enjoyment. Leaving Las Vegas felt like a combination Breaking the Waves, Love Liza, and All the Real Girls. This is a love story with so many different human elements coming to you at once that the average viewer would probably ignore the signs and see this as a depressing film. While it isn't the lightest film of the ages, it does prove that ""Love is a very splendid thing"".I cannot end this review without at least mentioning the amazing acting done by both Nicolas Cage and Elizabeth Shue. The chemistry between them is rare in Hollywood. I felt that these two really made this film and were just not placed in their roles to sell tickets. Cage really felt comfortable and understood his character while Shue fit perfectly with her secrets and heart. It is obvious why Cage won the Oscar for his role in this film, and while I am sure we will never see him take a role like this again (thanks to summer blockbusters), it was good to see him take a role that really redefined the romance genre. The same goes for Shue. While she hasn't really made another film like this one in a very long time (outside of Adventures in Babysitting), it is good to know that she can take on roles like this and have the guts to follow through.Overall, this was a very powerful and emotional film for me.Grade: ***** out of *****",Leaving Las Vegas
60,hall895,Great performances in a mediocre movie,6,8 May 2008,"Nicolas Cage plays hopeless drunk Ben Sanderson. Why is he a hopeless drunk? Well, we never really know. He's lost his family and his cushy Hollywood job so maybe that's it. Then again maybe he lost his family and job because he was a hopeless drunk. Anyway, Ben decides to go to Las Vegas and drink himself to death. Soon after arriving in Vegas he meets Sera, the clichéd hooker with a heart of gold who only seems to exist in movies. And almost immediately Sera falls in love with Ben. Because after all every woman is looking for a suicidal drunk to fall in love with right? Cage and Elisabeth Shue, who plays Sera, give commendable performances. Too bad the film itself can't live up to the standards set by its lead performers.This is essentially a two-character movie. Julian Sands plays Sera's pimp and early on it seems he might be a key player or at the very least perhaps his character will give us some insight into just who Sera is and how she got to this point in her life. And then all of a sudden Sands is gone and the rest of the movie is basically left in the hands of Cage and Shue. Very capable hands those are but their fine performances can't hide the failings of the story. The most prominent failure is that we never really get to know who these two characters are. The movie does a terrible job of establishing its only two important characters. Why do we care about these people? The movie never tells us. Maybe if we got to know Ben a little bit we could embrace him as a tragic figure. Instead he just comes off as a brusque drunken loser. It makes it hard to see why Sera would take it upon herself to act as this man's guardian angel. Maybe we'd buy into it if we knew something about Sera but we really don't. The whole thing strains credulity. And in addition to being rather unbelievable the story is also incredibly bleak and depressing. That doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing if the story is at least interesting but it's not. It's basically two hours of Sera watching Ben drink himself into oblivion. Entertaining it certainly is not. Given the type of role which is absolute Oscar bait Cage does very well and sure enough he got his golden statue. And Shue does a very good job as well. But two excellent performances can't hide the fact that this is not an excellent movie.",Leaving Las Vegas
61,sharky_55,We both realized that we didn't have that much time.,8,11 June 2016,"It is brave of Mike Figgis to telegraph the ending of this story. Most films would not get away with this, and most directors would not dare try. In Leaving Las Vegas, Ben Sanderson has decided to drink his life away. He has already lost his wife, kids and jobs, and been left with a generous (too generous, in his opinion) severance check with which he will drown his sorrows in. Somehow, we believe him. Cage's performance is convincing enough, and full of despair, that we are never once not convinced that at the end of the film, he will die. Ben knows it. And so does Sera, the prostitute that takes a liking to him. But we and her also hold onto that faint glimmer of hope that things won't turn out that way. Thank goodness Figgis has stuck to his guns and maintained his integrity. If by some miraculous incident Ben had managed to survive the film, it would be robbed of all its power, and it would contradict every painful movement and word that Cage utters. The film is a bit of a sensory overload. Figgis has shot Las Vegas in an attempt to immortalise each moment the pair spend in it, in all its beauty and chaos. A favoured and re-used technique drops the frame- rate and shutter speed so the night-time lights and sounds blare from indistinct sources, and the POV struggles and stagger around, the world whirling around it in all its drunken stupour. The soundtrack is an unrelenting mass of bluesy jazz, with saxophone amping the neo-noir feel. We are meant to be drinking along, or puffing on a cigarette and staring out the window at the neon sign flickering across the street. The most noticeable effect is the slow motion. Figgis heightens each tiny intimacy between Ben and Sera - one in particular is later re- used for the final, admittedly goofy, freeze frame. This all seems overly dramatic, and it is at times. While a film like My Own Private Idaho might forge immense emotional crevasses with its sparseness, Leaving Las Vegas feels the need to linger, often for too long. Figgis also shows an awareness of the conventional expectations of the his archetypes, and is smart enough to subvert. Ben is the suicidal alcoholic. Sera is the hooker with the heart of gold. The meet cute type situation would normally be sweet, and move the pair towards redemption and happiness. Quite a few scenes are actually framed in this way, and would neatly fit into one of those romantic-comedies, if not for the emotional baggage that has already been acquired. They dine and finely comb each others lives, but here they are not so guarded. They dive into an impromptu moment of sexual passion, but once again Ben's love of the drink ruins it (later he showers with a bottle, caressing it tenderly as if it was the female form). And they walk in the night, and Figgis does the thing where the score takes over, and we can see their mouths moving and laughing, but not what they are actually saying, so we are forced to use our own experiences to fill in the speech bubbles. This all seems so familiar, so it is heartbreaking that it is so sure of its ultimate demise. Many have indicated that Sera's attraction to Ben seems illogical - that a real hooker would not stick out her neck for such a self-destructive person. I think it is in fact this quality that Sera finds solace in. Ben tells her to never stop him drinking. She agrees, and in return, asks that she be spared judgement solely because of her occupation. They are totally comfortable in these roles, even as they are completely honest about how desolate and aimless they are. These sorts of completely non-judgemental relationships can only exist in brief vacuums, because sooner or later someone will hurt themselves beyond reason, and one will judge the other's destructive behaviour. So Sera begs him to get medical care, even as she knows that is is unfair of her to ask this because of their agreement. She fights an inner battle, pouring liquor all over her body as if it was the only way to entice him sexually. She is found in the kitchen like a good little housewife, cutting up her vegetables and preparing a meal, while he enters and leaves with a bottle without so much as looking at her. Shue's role is crucial because she has the choice to force herself out of the situation after Yuri leaves, but not the willpower and strength to execute it. So she wallows in despair along with Ben, and after a while, decides that she can fix him. He becomes a goal, something she has not set herself for a very long time. Shue's performance here is overlooked. Cage got the Oscar because he had external flashiness, the type that no one would miss. But Shue has a tremendously vulnerable quality. In her therapy sessions she brags that she has complete control of each of her clients, and that she is proud of how carefully she has distanced herself from the stigma of the job and kept her persona strong. So when Shue wavers, it is heartbreaking. When she discovers Ben at home with another prostitute, her entire face crumbles like a little girl, and it is as far away from that bragging woman as we can get.",Leaving Las Vegas
62,gftbiloxi,Memorable Performances; Implausible Film,5,3 February 2008,"Ben Sanderson (Nicholas Cage) is a raging alcoholic. When he is fired from his job, he moves to Las Vegas with the intention of drinking himself to death. Upon his arrival he meets an attractive prostitute named Sera (Elizabeth Shue) and the two strike up a quasi-romance in which he agrees not to condemn her profession and she agrees not to interfere with his determination to kill himself with alcohol. It is, many critics and fans say, a story of unconditional love. It is also one of the most profoundly overrated films to emerge from 1990s Hollywood.The primary problem with LEAVING LAS VEGAS is the implausibility of its characters. There have been, no doubt, men determined to literally drink themselves to death--but the fact remains that men in such an advanced stage of alcoholism aren't lovable, much less reasonably good looking, much less capable of the thought processes depicted here. There have been, no doubt, hookers with hearts of gold--but those who operate at the level of Sera are seldom memorable beauties and tend to be drug addicted, mentally ill, and often both. And it is very obvious that not a person involved with the film has the faintest idea of what a flop-house hotel is actually like.Having established these characters, the film proceeds to follow them to a bitter end that I found not in least moving because I never believed them in the first place. This is not to say that Cage and Shue give bad performances--they are actually remarkably good in their roles. It's just that the whole film, which touts itself as a hard slice of reality, is so unrealistic that Disney's LITTLE MERMAID looks like a documentary in comparison. Three stars for the performances, but they don't off-set the film's overall lack of veracity.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Leaving Las Vegas
63,rzajac,"Latter-day '70s-style artsy exercise, and moral Rorschach",8,10 July 2020,"I liked it! I just (finally) saw it (in 2020), and was struck by what seemed to have been a gutsy, straightforward adaptation of a tough novel to the screen.On the plus side: Loved the technical production work. I was really struck by an amazing thing; an odd balancing of music against dialog: The tech folks must've worked something out with the director/producers where they agreed to do something starkly against standard practice: The music and dialog are at about the same volume level, but they worked it out so (I guess) timbre contrasts allow us to focus on dialog and make out what they're saying, just fine. This was surprising. Also, editing and occasional montage work was balanced and added an artistic flair.The direction and acting was amazing. Below, I'll have some remonstrances about the story and its assumptions, but... this is one of those cases where direction and acting well nigh compel us to embrace a myth of an Ultimate Unconditional Love.But what *about* those storyline assumptions?Here's one way of putting it: Rousseau forwarded his myth of the Noble Savage. In his ""Cannery Row"", Steinbeck forwards a myth of the Noble Bum. Do you resonate with those myths? No? Yes?In LLV, a myth is forwarded of a Noble Suicidaire (suicidal guy). Do you buy that?To be fair, the myth is hazily articulated, to the point that it's a bit of a Rorschach: You decide what Cage's character is. Is his trajectory willful/volitional? If so, what's noble about that? Is he compelled by forces over which he has no volitional control? If that's the case, then upon what can he spar in a bid to showcase a nobility of spirit?This is why I take away a few stars. It's that juxtaposition of the message of Unconditional Love AND the haziness of the Cage character's presumed plight that makes for a somewhat confused message. If you're going to show folks struggling, then at least I want light shed on something. And this contrast takes away from a claim of an insight payload.But... even with those remonstrances in-tow, I can recommend this flick.",Leaving Las Vegas
64,ajs-10,"Great script, great music & some stunning performances...",9,11 March 2011,"I heard that this is the film that Nicolas Cage actually does some proper acting, thinking it was just another urban legend I sceptically turned on and watched. What do you know? Some urban legends are actually true! Based on a novel by John O'Brien, it's a love story, but a love story with a twist. More of that later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please run down to the store and get another bottle of vodka while I write the next paragraph).Having lost his job and his wife through drinking, alcoholic Ben Sanderson sells everything he owns and decides to go to Las Vegas to drink himself to death. He finds a cheap motel and goes for a drive. He almost hits a young woman, a prostitute called Sera. The next day he propositions her and they end up spending the night together, just talking. Her pimp, Yuri, is not pleased that she has not come back with very much money and sends her out the following night. She looks for, and eventually finds, Ben and invites him over to her place. This is just the beginning of a relationship that will take Sera on quite a roller-coaster ride of emotions. I won't say any more for fear of bringing the wrath of the spoiler police.I first have to say what a truly excellent script this is, some really great dialogue and a really well made film. The soundtrack is very good too, featuring plenty of songs performed by Sting in a cocktail lounge style. There's even a song co-written and performed by Nicolas Cage! Talking of which, he put in a truly stunning performance that fully deserved the Best Actor Oscar that year. I also thought Elisabeth Shue was exceptional as well, she fully deserved all the nominations and awards she won for this part. I will also give an honourable mention to Julian Sands as Yuri, whose performance was good, but maybe overshadowed by the other two.So, if we add together the soundtrack, the script and the performances, we've got a really great film. Well, it is great, but there are periods where we lose sight of Ben and concentrate on Sera which I found a little distracting. I'd have liked to have seen a few little cut scenes of Ben interspersed so we didn't lose track of him while telling Sera's story. Having said that, it's still a really great film and one I would happily watch again Highly recommended.My score: 8.8/10",Leaving Las Vegas

69,EijnarAmadeus,Dark End of the Street,8,28 February 2010,"Nicolas Cage's performance in this is phenomenal, the way he performs his character to say things with thoughts and meanings elsewhere and his physical torsion is undoubtedly the finest Cage's done. He plays alcoholic Ben who's landed in Las Vegas to drink himself to the act of death, and at the evening of his arrival he encounters prostitute Sera (Elisabeth Shue, who does the other fearless performance in this film) by almost driving her down (Sera: ""Red light. I walk. You stop.""). They develop a relationship where at center is the equal respect and acceptance for who the other is, as Ben tells her after she's suggested him to move in with her - ""You can never, ever, ask me to stop drinking."" The determination of Ben's candidly descent to hell is unwavering, and he warns Sera that things will only get worse - but she's passionately in love with him, and although the clichéd design of a prostitute with a heart could easily be a trap for the film, it's written with such earnestness and pain, and is so greatly performed by the two actors, that it turns into something originally touching and powerful. It's a lot of down-the-drain so to speak, and this depressing vein at core adds to the film's joylessly pulsating feel, and other supplements is the great soundtrack (score by director Mike Figgis) that's fueled with tracks that often emerges from a bar-jukebox in the early hours of the morning, and the feverish portrait of Las Vegas where streets have dark ends.",Leaving Las Vegas

The film is mainly about two sad people who are having a midlife crisis, and watching them is intoxicating(no pun intended I swear).Cage really earned his Oscar here, even though I sort of hated him. I think that Shue definitely should've won for her wonderfully sad performance here. We grow to truly care about these characters, and thats mainly why the ending is so sad.This is a powerful and wonderful film that will keep you thinking about it long after its over.

Mike Figgis obliges us with a helpful hint in the scene where Nicolas Cage gives Elizabeth Shue a present of earrings: Greek cameos.As in the ancient tale, love challenges the inevitability of death, although, in the case of LLV, roles are upended and sometimes blurred, and Orphean references are either thinly disguised, or non-specific to the point of being thoroughly sublimated. Academic, to be sure, but completely acceptable as long as LLV can sustain itself and remain engaging. And it surely does, thanks to Figgis' intelligent script and direction, Cage's role as a down-and-out writer and his protracted self-destruction, and Shue's portrayal of a lonely hooker, lifting that old bromide beyond what could have been routine, since .With all that said, this film is not for everyone (in particular those who only respond to gratuitous sex, car chases, and mindless pyrotechnics). The lurid depictions of despair, self-loathing, and violence could put off even the most hardened social worker. In my mind's eye, I could see psychiatrists amongst the theater audiences, furiously jotting down their observations. Understandable; the two principal characters are, in the common parlance, screwed up. One cannot cope with failure, so decides to opt out, while the other does cope, but only barely, existing along the ragged edges of what passes for society in Nevada Hell.

73,moviesleuth2,Cage and Shue are Marvelous,9,27 August 2008,"She was a lonely woman in Las Vegas. All he needed was someone to listen. So is the set up for one of the most haunting and unforgettable films I have ever seen.Ben Sanderson (Nicholas Cage) is an alcoholic who has lost everything. Having given up on life, he goes to Las Vegas to drink himself to death. There he meets Sera (Elisabeth Shue), a lonely hooker. They begin a curious friendship that turns into a love affair. Both of them know, however, that their love is doomed: he made her promise not to try to get him to stop his long, alcohol-induced suicide.There are really only two things that matter in this film: Nicholas Cage and Elisabeth Shue. While there are bit parts sprinkled around, and Mike Figgis' direction enhances the production, this film is solely about Cage and Shue. If one of them doesn't succeed in their performance, the quality of the film drops significantly. Fortunately, both performances are among the best I've ever seen.Cage, who won a much deserved Oscar for his portrayal of the doomed Ben Sanderson, gives the best performance of his career. Known for his off-the-wall characters, Cage is at home here, but he's not the usual Cage. Cage throws himself into the character so much that it's hard to believe that he's acting (or more to the point, sober). He grows more and more like a sickly zombie as the film goes on, and it's jaw-dropping.Elisabeth Shue's career has not been a very good one, and this movie shows why that is such an abomination. Shue is at a disadvantage here; compared to Cage's more visually striking character, it's almost a given that Shue would get lost in this film. But Shue does something that I have never seen before: she completely bridges that gap and perfectly equals Cage. I have not seen ""Dead Man Walking,"" which is the film where Susan Sarandon beat Shue for the Best Actress Oscar. But quite honestly, I can't imagine Sarandon topping Shue's performance. Shue is something fierce; not in her character, but in her ability, and she needs to be recognized for it.Mike Figgis' directing suits the material perfectly. ""Leaving Las Vegas"" is an intoxicating film (no pun intended-that's really the only way to describe it). The drunken warmness of the film belies the meticulous planning that Figgis' must have done to create such a film.As good as this film is (and it is VERY good), it's not perfect. The first half an hour is a disjointed one, and it leaves things out that should be explained. If Figgis was trying to create a different king of drunkenness than what he does in the latter film, it works, but his handling of it is not as good as it could have been. But what comes after it is so good that it ALMOST warrants a 10 for the whole film. Additionally, the kindling of the romance is rushed, but Cage and Shue are so earnest and intensely sympathetic that we are swept along anyway.This is not a happy film. Even the ""humorous"" moments are just as heartbreaking as they are ""funny."" But it is a must-see for any and every one, especially if they love good cinema and stellar acting.",Leaving Las Vegas

Cage's interpretation is a tour de force: it is not at all easy to play out being drunk without actually being so. The fear was that he would go over the top, but mercifully his performance stays on the rails and is utterly convincing. I usually tend to swerve away from films about alcoholics, drug-taking or things like that: they seem to me to be topics reflecting the uglier sides of life which I would rather do without. However I try not to shun realistic cinema, character-driven pieces. Such is the case with this powerful film. Everybody knows a born-loser in life. They exist all around us. Here is one who wants to escape all that drinking himself to death. An arduous task, indeed, but Nicholas Cage pulls it off masterfully.

It's by far one of the most depressing film I have ever seen in my life not to mention so raunchy and sleazy you'll want to take a shower after watching it. Nicolas Cage gives an unbelievably accurate performance as an alcoholic (a performance that rightfully earned him the Oscar in 1995), while Elisabeth Shue (who I felt deserved the Best Leading Actress Oscar in 1995 over Susan Sarandon for 'Dead Man Walking') is just as brilliant in her role as the caring and tragic prostitute who falls in love with the drunken Cage. 'Leaving Las Vegas' has a jazz/blues musical score that somehow fits in perfectly with the film, and Mike Figgis provides us with some eye-popping direction as well as an intricate screenplay. 'Leaving Las Vegas' is one hell of a downer, and I only recommend it for the strong-hearted. Watch out for cameos by Laurie Metcalf, French Stewart, R. Lee Ermey, Richard Lewis, Steven Webber and Law & Order's Mariska Hargitay. . The bottom line is that Mike Figgis' 'Leaving Las Vegas' is a powerful film, but also a seedy, disturbing and depressing film. Grade: B+",Leaving Las Vegas

Exemplifying the film's bluntness is a phrase by Shue: ""The only thing waiting for me when I get back home is mouth wash, to wash away the taste of sperm"".It's a pity really, this could have been a groundbreaking, excellent film if the screenplay had paid a little more attention to the why's and how's, and tried to be a little more realistic about the quantity Cage drinks, which is unreasonable. It also goes a little ""over the top"" in some scenes which was not necessary.

80,chrisbrown6453,The best feel-bad movie of 1995 was Leaving Las Vegas.,7,17 June 2002,"The glitzy, yet gritty, tale of drunken deathwisher Ben Sanderson is sketchy and the script doesn't really fill us in on the main characters' backgrounds, so there is something of an emotional void at the inevitable tragic climax. Still, the terminal romance, as portrayed, is powerful stuff. Ben has suffered failures in his marriage and in his LA job, so he relocates to Nevada, where he plans to spend his severance package drinking himself to death. This fantasy of letting go of all earthly ties is something we can all appreciate, but people whom have battled alcoholism in the past tell me that it's an awfully romanticized portrayal. Shouldn't there be a lot more puking? 
Nicholas Cage has deservedly won a bunch of awards for his nervy performance edged with fatalistic humor. The big surprise is wholesome Elizabeth Shue giving her all as the accommodating Vegas hooker Sera, who has the obligatory heart of gold and plenty of swizzle sticks. Shue's come a long way from Adventures in Babysitting. Essentially a two-character drama, Leaving Las Vegas features some priceless cameos. Julian Sands, Julian Lennon, Laurie Metcalf and R. Lee Ermey make the most of their short times on screen. Also loved the caustic motel lady who tells the two lovebirds to pack up their Johnnie Walker and beat it. British director Mike Figgis has fashioned an all-American art film, shooting the whole thing in Super 16mm, which gives it a most distinctive stylized look. The budget is minuscule ($3.5 million) by Hollywood standards, but talent prevails.

81,acedj,My introduction to Mr. Cage,10,28 April 2020,"Leaving Las Vegas is the story of Ben Sanderson played with perfection by Nicolas Cage. Ben is a raging alcoholic and having given up on life liquidates all he owns and goes to Vegas to drink himself to death. He meets a prostitute named Sera, played by the gorgeous Elizabeth Shue, and he pays her to spend time with him while he destroys himself. Sera does her best to try to prevent him from reaching his ultimate goal of death as she ends up falling in love with him.This movie was the first thing I had ever seen Nick Cage in, and to me this is still his best role. I had been familiar with Elizabeth Shue from The Karate Kid, Cocktail and Adventures In Babysitting, but this was the first role where I saw her really spread her wings and be the actress that she could be. This is a very sad tale, but not one that I regret having seen, as is evident with my 10 star rating. This is an excellent movie with some really superior acting by the two leads.",Leaving Las Vegas

The movie is an intense ride of heavy drinking mixed with more heavy drinking. It is shocking and sometimes hard to watch and I dare anyone to have a hard drink afterwards and not feel a little unpleasant. Because of Cages portrayal of this man you literally see what happens when things get out of control. He is equally counterbalanced with Elisabeth Shue who also has plenty of screen time to convince you she's one hell of a loving prostitute (both privately and business wise). The emotions between them seem incredibly natural and real, which makes the movie so much sadder. Actually, if it weren't for an expectedly bad and awkward performance by Julian Sands (man I don't like this guy, to me he is capable of making every movie he's in instantly feel like a B-class flick) I would not have a single thing to bitch about. I loved everything else about ""Leaving Las Vegas"" - besides the acting I especially have to mention the late starting opening credits, which simply because they were so unusual, made the movie a new experience to watch. Great script, directing, acting, music, story and theme. Can't believe I saw it so late. 9/10",Leaving Las Vegas
83,Flagrant-Baronessa,Balances sweetness in two raw lives,7,14 November 2006,"In many ways, this is a film that separates the lovers of cinema from the average movie watcher. It is a relentlessly grim and depressing portrayal of a blissful state in miserable circumstances that will not be easy or enjoyable to watch. It appears I do not fall into either category, for I can see that Mike Figgis' Leaving Las Vegas is very well crafted and feels 'real'  but I certainly wouldn't want to sit through the experience again.Nevertheless the performances in the film alone are worthy of a great deal of praise  between Nicholas Cage as the broken over-the-hill alcohol and Elisabeth Shue as the angelic prostitute, it is impossible to decide who is best. Needless to say, the combination of the two is downright remarkable. Cage received an academy award for best actor for his broken, bruised and sleazy portrayal of Ben, a former screenwriter who is seen on a drunken rampage in the beginning of the film, slurring to a prostitute: ""I don't know if I started drinking because my wife left me or if she left me because I started drinking"". Even as the film progresses, we learn little about him, other than that he heads to Las Vegas to literally drink himself to death.When he meets the brave prostitute Sera, sparks fly but they are of the quiet kind. There is no feverish in-your-face passion from moment 1, just a reassuring chemistry between them as they form a doomed friendship. ""Ben, it's not about sex."" Sera tells him after he's told her he'd be of no good use to her. Cage even steps up in his acting at this point, projecting a heartrending intensity and emotional transparency about him. He captures the tragic nature of his character aptly, such as waking up in the middle of the night twitching in a seedy motel room and downing whisky to stabilize him. Sera narrates the events in close-ups throughout the film  a device I found a little incongruous. The overly jazzy tune also gets on your nerves after a while.Leaving Las Vegas is about loneliness and drowning your sorrows. It's about sweet passion in the midst of misery, and it proves a tragic amalgam. Even the cinematography is unmistakably grim and depressing; we follow our characters through a grainy kaleidoscope, even in the flashy of Las Vegas. It has been likened to Midnight Cowboy (1969), which I believe to be a spot-on comparison at least in simplistic terms. Both detail the doomed relationships in a big city, featuring an idealist centre (Jon Voight in MC, Ben and Sera's relationship in LLV) in the midst of disillusioned characters and dire circumstances. The result is compelling, with lots of raw graphic dialogue and scenes, but in the end Leaving Las Vegas simply lacks a bit of charm.7.5 out of 10",Leaving Las Vegas

86,jayjaycee,"What happens in Vegas, dies in Vegas?",10,28 April 2020,"""Leaving Las Vegas"" is a 1995 drama directed by Mike Figgis starring Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue. There is probably no actor in Hollywood more controversial than Nicolas Kim Coppola, better known by his stage name Nicolas Cage. You either love him or hate, some consider him to be a misunderstood genius, but it's undeniable that he is regarded by the most to be the worst actor to have ever worked in the business and there is really barely a chance to defend him from his reputation of be(e)ing a total laughingstock. His filmography is without a doubt disastrous and equipped with some titles that never should have seen the light of the day (""Ghostrider"", ""Wicker Man""), but before his career went down the pan, he starred in one or two decent films in the early days and this one here is by far the best title in his repertoire. To me, it's another re-watch, as I already experienced it roughly one year ago, but during a hard time for me, so I wasn't really able to open up my mind for it, but the more I thought about it in the last couple of weeks, the more brilliant details I remembered about it. Thus, I had to revisit it and it was definitely worth it. Who would have thought that Cage would play the main character in a serious drama and that this role would grant him an Oscar later on? I bet no one. It's nothing short of astonishing how Cage embodies the protagonist of the John O'Brien semi-autobiographical novel of the same name. Honestly, it deeply shocked me when I found out that it is not just a work of fiction, but the actual life experiences of a troubled author. I guess that's why this film feels so uncomfortably realistic all the time. This hyper realistic scenario and the character that act in it are undoubtedly the biggest strength of this film. Both of the two protagonists are absolutely fleshed out and the story combines several details that gave me severe goose bumps. Without wasting too much time, the film already starts in a not quite mildly depressing way. Cage portrays formerly successful screenwriter Ben Sanderson with such a breath-taking authenticity and manages to perfectly portray the haunted human being he is. Probably everything that could go wrong eventually went wrong in his life. His wife and son left him for his excessive alcohol consume, he loses his job for the same reason and visibly suffers from his severe alcoholism. What left me speechless the most is how this obviously miserable man is treated by his fellow human beings, because instead of aiding him with his problems they all ignore and reject him instead. It is not a huge surprise that he then ultimately gives up on himself and leaves behind everything that once indicated that he has ever existed. His desperate and obvious cry for help is blatantly ignored by each and everyone and that leads him to the decision to slowly drink himself to death in a beautiful place. In the first few minutes it has already become clear in what direction this film would go. It basically consists of three main emotions that are prominently used throughout the whole run time: Melancholy, loneliness and depression. To be honest, it is extremely hard to watch how this pitiful alcoholic openly shares his plans to slowly commit suicide and doesn't find anyone who would listen to him. This movie perfectly managed to capture the perfidy of depression and Cage heartbreakingly conveys this subliminally brutal feeling as well. Not only the fact that he does have a drink in his hand in every single scene, also how his perception is distorted by his haunting feelings (""The Whole You're In"") show that he literally settled his affairs. The location he travels to, the fabulous Las Vegas, also has a special meaning in the context of his personal misery. In a town where everyone is supposed to have fun and be lucky, there's this one man who contradicts all of those ideals and just desires to die. While everyone is gambling for money, he is gambling with his life and nobody really seems to care about it. Until he meets Sera, a hooker with an unusually spelled first name, the only one in the whole bright lit city who seems to rudimentarily understand him and his problems. It is absolutely fascinating how those two social outcasts find a connection to each other and how they form an unlikely friendship in the process. This probably works out so extremely well, because the equally authentic performance of Shue and the overall weirdly genuine chemistry between those two strangers allow it. What starts out as a business relationship then slowly turns into mild affection and eventually some strange sort of romance. The tragic thing about those two is how Sera gradually begins to love him and even tries to restrain him from his suicidal endeavour but promises him that she would not try to stop him. From the start it's obvious that the affiliation between them would end tragically and as the viewer you can only witness the bond between the two deteriorating and feel as powerless as Sera does. In the same totally dismally manner, the plot continues to offer one depressing event after another and focuses on the tragic lives of those two hopeless characters. The fact that the whole film is mostly underlined by a moody jazz score and songs with upbeat melodies but negative lyrics (""Angel Eyes"" by Sting, for example) also add another certain effect to the whole atmosphere, as it purposely resembles the discrepancy between the always happy city in the desert and the haunted man that maunders in it. The obviously inevitable but not less devastating ending perfectly rounds up the films completely nihilistic nature and even though it was to be expected, it was totally heartbreaking to see as it somehow proves that refusal eventually wins over devotion and that some people could not be saved from themselves. He reached his goal and no one was able to help him. The many close up shots this film consists of don't really make it easier to cope with the intensity of the depicted tragedy, as it perfectly captures the misery even more and on top of that allows the viewer to feel it even more instensively . All in all, this drama perfectly depicts the inexorable downfall of a troubled man and mercilessly depicts even the smallest emotion of this unforgiving journey to a painful death. Touchingly narrated, this heartbreakingly and strangely beautiful tragedy doesn't mince matters and pitilessly enacts a perfect tragedy, thanks to outstanding performances of its lead actors and the scarily high comprehension of its controversial subject matter and well paced and at times subliminally sarcastic screenplay. It once again left me speechless and I sat there in total silence for the last twenty minutes or something, just because it is so absolutely gut wrenching to witness. Under all the artificial neon lights that are supposed to radiate joy, lust and pleasure there are also shadows and an endless darkness that no one talks about. Except for this film. If you ever need to experience how talented Nicolas Cage is go ahead and watch this film. It will change your opinion about him forever. A hauntingly formative and devastating masterpiece. Without a doubt one of the most depressing and but brilliant dramas of the decade. This one will stick with you for a while...",Leaving Las Vegas

88,mnpollio,An assembly line drama that reads like an Oscar checklist,4,29 April 2011,"There are films that truly amaze you with their hidden depths and their emotional impact. Conversely, there are those that read like a checklist of ingredients that assure critical accolades as though they were impersonally constructed on an assembly line and act as though the viewer has an Oscar ballot in their popcorn bucket. Leaving Las Vegas is definitely one of those films.Alcoholic loser Nicolas Cage decides to commit suicide in the title city by drinking himself to death. He drifts into a love affair with prostitute Elisabeth Shue on the understanding that she will not interfere with his death wish. That is pretty much it for the plot and if there is a morsel of interest in there, it gets lost in translation to the screen.Director Mike Figgis has always been a master of the moody, but less successful with the substantial. Here he provides the suitable melancholy background for the tale of woe to unfold, but it feels unusually manufactured. A description that infiltrates into all areas of this film. There is an odd feel that we are watching something mass-produced rather than organic. Figgis specializes in scenes where losers drop in melancholy despair on benches while nuns in full habits are seen in the background handing out pamphlets on salvation. Cue the irony! Everything disturbingly comes off as a grab for attention.Much of the problem centers on the main character played by Nicolas Cage. Leaving Las Vegas symbolizes Cage's fall into the predictable. This role is a veritable grab bag of Oscar musts and the screenplay sanitizes alcoholism just enough to make it palatable. Naturally, Cage is not a violent drunk, but a relatively docile one and the film strains itself to make him an object of pity rather than scorn or revulsion. When he vomits from his binge drinking, it is never really shown – just alluded to. To say that Cage's backstory is flimsy is an understatement. We never learn what has driven him to his suicidal impulses or why the romance with Shue never causes him to reconsider his decision. We also never understand why Shue is initially attracted to and compelled to cohabit with Cage, nor are we ever sold on why this love permeates Cage's bleary-eyed delirium to develop into something more than a one- or two-night stand. The entire central relationship ends up seeming like it was dreamed up by writer's whim for the imagined inherent melodrama. Additionally, the film's depiction of the onlookers is absurd – and I am speaking as someone who grew up with an alcoholic in the house. Nearly every person presented seems to have an unending supply of patience and pity for Cage. Bartenders want him to be saved, prostitutes fall for him, even the security that escort him out after he upends a table treat him with a modicum of concern. Aside from one instance, no one is annoyed by his behavior or his self-destructiveness. They are all just incredibly and improbably moved. Every aspect of the writing for this character and Cage's performance is perfectly calibrated to prompt pity at every turn.Shue actually gives the better performance despite being miscast, largely because her role by definition is at least allowed to have more of an emotional range than Cage's. Shue is sympathetic, but not really convincing. First off, no matter how much garish make-up and how many provocative costumes you dress her in, Shue still looks like the freshly scrubbed all-American girl-next-door. There is absolutely no way that any woman who looked like this would be a third-class hooker in Las Vegas - someone would have snatched her up and employed her in a far ritzier capacity. The film would have us believe at one point that Shue's experienced hooker would not know to avoid a gaggle of drunken frat boys or how to finesse the situation, so naturally we end up with a gratuitous rape scene. An actress who appears far more seasoned may have been a better selection here. It also does not help that Shue is forced to spend a great deal of time staring earnestly with dewy eyes at Cage's slurring lump. And, in the end, it is difficult not to realize that Shue is stuck playing that most clichéd of roles – the prostitute with a heart of gold.Then again, the haphazard writing may well have done anyone in. For instance, outside of the sanitized view of alcoholism, Shue's classy living quarters and her ability to pay for a quality therapist hardly seem to jibe with the low-class hooker the film otherwise wishes to paint. But then again, these flourishes are ostentatiously included to remind us that this call girl has insight, depth and aspirations. The most telling moment of the film's inadequacy occurs at a weekend outing where the drunken Cage falls into a glass table and then starts dancing around yelling ""I'm a prickly pear! I'm a prickly pear!"" The annoyed manager comes over to clean up the mess and politely invites Shue to get Cage and leave. The camera focuses on Shue's astonished boo-boo face and one realizes that this minor role of the manager is the only realistically portrayed person or moment in the film. To say there is nothing worthwhile here is incorrect. The photography is well done and, as previously mentioned, Shue is worthwhile despite the less than convincing casting. However, the film is nowhere near as provocative or moving as fans and critics would have you believe. I find the film fairly unmoving. The clichéd writing and Cage's showy ""pity me"" performance are off-putting enough, but there is a synthetic feel about the entire endeavor. Everything seems like it was belabored on storyboards for maximum potential to the point where it literally has a muted emotional impact. In short, it comes across like watching pasteurized Oscar fodder from a can by Chef Boyardee.",Leaving Las Vegas
89,kijii,'Dipso-suicide',8,29 November 2016,"Nicolas Cage won a Best Actor Oscar for this movie, while, Elisabeth Shue was nominated for Best Actress, and Mike Figgis received two nominations: Best Director and Best Writer for a screenplay. Figgis also wrote the original film score for the movie and had a small acting part. So, in many ways, this was HIS movie.This is easily the most depressing Oscar-winning movie in my recollection, and movies don't often depress me. However, this one about a hopeless self-destructive alcoholic, Ben Sanderson (Nicholas Cage), who openly declares that he plans to drink himself to death is depressing beyond belief. When he meets a 'high-price' Las Vegas hooker, Sera (Elisabeth Shue), who loves him so much that she wants to live with him, she must agree never to interfere with his planned 'dipsosuicide.' Sera: Don't you like me, Ben? Ben: Sera... what you don't understand is- no, see, no. You can never, never ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand? Sera: I do. I really do.The two live out their two separate lives while watching their mutual destruction without complaint.I think that Cage DID play the alcoholic personality rather well in that he tries to be loved in spite of his despicable and unapologetic condition, often trying to laugh it off, which, I understand, is often the way that alcoholics deal with the disease. That is, he wants to be loved in spite of his declared suicide pact:Sera: Is drinking a way of killing yourself? Ben: Or, is killing myself a way of drinking?Perhaps, Cage played the role TOO well for me as I will never look at this movie again.

With only two important characters, the entire film rests heavily on the shoulders of Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue, and neither of them disappoint.Of the two, Nicolas Cage is the Oscar winner and the truly deserving one at that. He is simply hypnotic as Ben Sanderson, an alcoholic so far gone he doesn't even remember why he wants to die. His withdrawal scenes are so real they are upsetting, whereas his drunken charisma is so real its almost funny. The balance that Cage strikes really highlights how tragic his character really is. He conveys hatred and rage and loneliness and despair, and you will be so sad yet so hooked that its impossible to look away. Elisabeth Shue gets off to a slower start than Cage, but she is still an endearing, emotional character, capable of great things.The writing is very good, giving Cage the perfect, pitiful dialogue in order to serve his woeful character, and even throws in a hypnotic monologue or two. The best thing that Figgis achieves in this film is his cruel and deliberate intersplicing of mood-killing incidents (invariably caused by alcohol) between the moments of love and passion that Shue and Cage share. It is a relentless reminder that their love story is completely doomed. Sting's My One and Only Love is all over this film, which I thought was a very good choice, in addition to the beautiful and haunting score.The final act focuses a little too much on Shue and not enough on Cage, and whilst their final scene together was appropriately pathetic to suit the tragedy of the film, I couldn't help but feel less engaged. I also didn't enjoy Shue's constant commentary, given that it doesn't really go anywhere.But between the raw passion of Nicholas Cage and the uncompromising guiding hand of Mike Figgis, any complaints I could ever have otherwise found in Leaving Las Vegas are completely washed away.",Leaving Las Vegas

94,asifahsankhan,Cage and Shue are brilliant here!,9,3 October 2018,"I think this is the first time I've seen Leaving Las Vegas since that time I'm not really sure when. It still holds up as a serious emotional wallop of a movie. Nicolas Cage plays Benjamin, a drunk whose life is coming apart at the seams already when we meet him. He hounds a friend for a few bucks in a fancy L.A. restaurant. He's let go from his job. He burns or trashes all his possessions, including a photograph of a wife and son, a fleeting glimpse of Ben's past that is never accompanied by explanation. Then he moves to Vegas, sells his car, and meets Sera (Shue) whom he tells of his plan to kill himself by slowly poisoning his body. It ought to take three to four weeks, he figures.Ben and Sera have an immediate and inexplicable attraction to one another - or at least she to him. Ben seems more in need of a little bit of human companionship in his final weeks. She's a prostitute. He's a drunk. The two of them wear these titles as if they're immutable facts of their lives. He tells her, after she asks him to stay at her place, that she can never ask him to stop. And she gets this because she knows he can't ask her to stop turning tricks. Although maybe she needs someone to care enough to ask that of her, and maybe that's why she eventually asks him to see a doctor.Figgis wrote the screenplay based on the novel by John O'Brien, with which I have no familiarity. We know Ben lost his wife and son, presumably through divorce resulting from his alcoholism, and a rage in the middle of a casino from which he's dragged away while screaming, ""He's my son,"" suggests perhaps he lost custody. All we know about Sera is that she's been under the thumb of an abusive pimp (Julian Sands) until he's dispatched by some gangsters to whom he owe money. In any other film it might be a major fault that the characters have so little back story, but there's a magnetism in Cage's and Shue's performances and in Figgis's screenplay that makes it better that we know so little about Ben and Sera outside the actual events taking place on screen. It forces the viewer to directly confront their behaviors and actions without consideration for where they've been. The effect is a spare, yet highly effective, film.",Leaving Las Vegas

The only reason this movie is not excruciating to watch is the bits of humor Cage adds- free-wheeling through the liquor store and at the biker bar. The score adds immensely to the film from Biker Bar to Going South to Angel Eyes- Sting's contribution is lots of mood. I'm glad a small movie made it big- Shue is a sad eyed street walker and Cage her complement.... not a pretty story, but hey, as bill w will tell you alcoholism ain't pretty.",Leaving Las Vegas
96,stills-6,"Impressive in many respects, but flat overall",7,18 October 1999,"The structure of this movie impressed me. It shifts from Cage's story to Shue's story about halfway through. Are their stories really any different? If you were told that your future will be a bleak wasteland, would you try to kill yourself over it or would you just keep going and hope it doesn't happen? Cage tries the former, Shue the latter.I was also impressed by the performances - even by Richard Lewis, whose cold stare was something I didn't think he could manage. Cage gives his character permission to be surprised at the decadence of his demise and the emotions that it brings up, however briefly. Shue's complex performance is actually better than his. She has to carry at least one half of the movie by herself (Cage maybe gets 1/4 by himself), and she does it beautifully. I have to give Figgis credit for making his actors give their all.However, the overall effect of the movie is rather flat, leaving you with the feeling that there was something missing. There's something about this movie that feels forced. For example, I could not for one second believe that Shue's character would be seeing an analyst. She's much too pragmatic and isolated to submit to that kind of authority figure. There is also the problem of the interludes, seeming excuses to set mood, which only serve to remind us that we're watching a movie whose images have been prefabricated, instead of making it an organic experience. There's a lot of that kind of feeling throughout. There are scenes that are supposed to be genuine moments which fall apart because of some kind of artificial ""mood"" that the director is trying to create. Like the camera angles, which should be a way of letting us in on the action as the story sees it (exception - the shot of Shue leaving Sands' hotel room for what may be the last time). But when Cage offers her money in the street or when she gives him the flask as a gift or even the culminating scene in his hotel room, there's something that's just wrong about the direction - it takes you out of the experience of seeing a movie and instead makes you intensely aware that you're just watching images. I have to blame Figgis for these ""tricks"" - they appear as amateurish film-school devices and just serve to remove us from the experience. You could forgive one or two, but it's every minute there's something like this.",Leaving Las Vegas
97,JoshtheGiant,Wonderful Acting,9,22 January 2006,Leaving Las Vegas has some of the best performances of the nineties and some wonderful direction and a fine screenplay. This makes it more than worth watching and into a film you should really see and I am giving it a four star rating for the things I just mentioned and it's sheer power and ability to change lives. But I do wan't to say that it is also a very flawed film and that the story fails to really go anywhere and it feels the same throughout the whole film. Nicolas Cage is a wonderful actor and this is most likely his best performance although Adaptation could give it a run for it's money. He is amazing getting the drunk completely right. Elizabeth Shue is also amazing as a hooker who falls in love with him. The direction is also Oscar worthy mostly because it manages to really make you care about the characters and to manipulate your emotions even with such a mediocre story and a screenplay that is not much better. A gut wrenching film with some powerful performances and great direction that will end up disturbing the heck out of you.,Leaving Las Vegas
98,karl_consiglio,Drowning your sorrows,9,9 November 2006,I thought this was great movie. Nicholas Cage is such a great actor. Here he plays the part of wretched alcoholic Ben who has chosen to drink himself to death. A very slow suicide. Symetrically Sera is a prostitute he meets in Vegas were the bars are always open falls in love with him and together they form a true and honest relationship. Both love and except one another the way they are. this film reaches a great climax. Leaving Las Vegas could be understood as a metaphor as in leaving the world be it a beautiful place it is also full of crap. Elizabeth's role can satisfy any man's fantasy and Ben fantasizes her as his angel to get him through the valley of death.,Leaving Las Vegas

How does one write a comment about a film that has obvious artistic stature, made by a talented director and cast, but is not entertainment? Leaving Las Vegas is not in any way, at least in the given, broadly accepted, lexicon definition of the word, entertainment.  What is it, then?	This is for the ""hit your head hard against the wall because it feels so good when you stop"" school of film craft.  The concept as represented here is arguably meaningless.  Unrelenting in its presentation of the degradation a man determined to kill himself, it never betrays the sadistic or cruel spirit.   	So what do we have here?  Do we have a re-visitation of the neorealist period?  No, there is essentially no story here, not one that is in the least discernible.  Do we have a study in behavior?  No, we never have a valid clue, only fleeting tokens deliberately nodded at, as to motive.   We never get to know who the characters are beyond a two dimensional display. What we have here, in my humble opinion, is a mistake.  Forget this one. 	We can't close here without saluting the good effort of the lead actors. We can see each actor, however, in far more enjoyable fare.  As for the obviously talented director, Mike Figgis, he presents continuity well but we hope that he learns the meaning of entertainment if he is to make more films.",Leaving Las Vegas
102,quinimdb,Leaving Las Vegas,9,19 May 2016,"""Leaving Las Vegas"" is about two sides of the same coin that need each other to feel complete. It is hard hitting and incredibly realistic. Nicolas Cage is perfectly cast for his crazy acting style as a raging alcoholic, and he gives an incredibly heart rending and accurate performance. Elisabeth Shue gives the performance of her career as a desperate and abused prostitute that begins to cling to Cage in his final, suffering days.Ben Sanderson is a failed screenwriter that once had a wife and a kid, but is now an alcoholic. He drinks when he wakes up and drinks himself to sleep everyday. When he doesn't get a drink, he goes into withdrawal. It is unclear whether he was a drunk before or after his wife left him, but it seems he no longer remembers nor cares. He is hopeless, and knows this, but when he is fired from his job, he decides to finally just leave everything behind and move to Las Vegas. He gets a room in a hotel called ""The Whole Year Inn"", or as he sees it, ""The Hole You're In"".Here he meets Sera, a hooker who is abused by her boss, but convinces herself that her life is just as good as she wants it to be. She says that every man she sleeps with is like a performance, she becomes whoever they want her to be. This is until Ben pays her and invites her to his hotel room. However, Ben doesn't want to have sex with her. They stay up and just talk, and Sera accidentally falls asleep and spends the night. But she finds that she was herself around another human being for the first time that night. She knew that Ben was hopeless, and he made her feel wanted and not alone. Once her abusive boss is killed, she starts to go out more with Ben. She invites him into her home, and he agrees to stay, only after telling her what she will have to deal with. She feels truly loved by him, and most importantly, not alone. She knows that she can't stop his alcoholism, and he knows that he can't stop her being a hooker. They have both dug themselves into that hole, and no matter how much abuse they take, they can't get out. And the only ones that could possibly put up with their lifestyles, is each other. Or, at first, at least. Their lifestyles begin to tear each other apart. Sera knows that Ben will die and Ben knows Sera is with other men. They are torn apart, and Sera has a horrible night in which she is abused and raped by some teenagers. She is kicked out of her house, and she realizes that she is powerless and lost without Ben. She finds Ben as he is on his deathbed, and in Bens final moments, he has sex with her, showing that he truly loves her, and accepted that she won't change. And Sera doesn't try to help Ben, showing she accepts that he won't change. Ben dies and Sera lives on without him, but Sera knew that it would happen eventually. The film is depressing, but it is unwavering in its harsh depiction of the hole these characters are in. It knows that the only way for them to leave Las Vegas is to die. They needed each other to be complete, but their relationship was doomed from the start because of the position they were each in. It is almost completely hopeless and the characters only get more depressed and cynical, but thats the way it needs to be. This film is to alcohol, as ""Requiem for a Dream"" is to drugs.",Leaving Las Vegas
103,kergillian,Raw and uninhibited. A definite must-see!,8,10 April 2001,"Spoilers At first I didn't like this film; the first fifteen to twenty minutes were painful to watch. But then I realized that this is what makes the film so bloody good! It has to be painful! This film comes with no candy-coating; it lays everything out on the table in front of you, raw and without explanation or justification, you have to make your own judgment. Each character is what s/he is, and there's no whining or bitching and moaning about how hard life is and how hard it was growing up yadda-yadda-yadda. The characters just deal. Why? Because they have to. When Ben sets out to booze himself to death, he doesn't let anything get in his way or distract him. And he's an unsympathetic character. Just when you start to like him he does something or says something horribly cruel or inexcusably stupid and that just makes you grit your teeth and hope he learns. But he doesn't learn, because it's not about learning, it's about people past learning who are left to simply deal. Why? because-they-have-to.Nicholas Cage is brilliant. He deserved the Oscar (*that's* a sentence that I thought I'd never say...). He's a schizophrenic actor; one great film (hello Raising Arizona!) one *awful* film (Snake Eyes anyone?) another great film (Face/Off rocked!) and another *awful* one (did you see 9MM?? don't!!) This was his tour-de-force. The best role he's ever played. And Elisabeth Shue *really* helps. The chemistry between them is delightfully tense, a perfect match for this film.My two issue: the music. It's been lauded and praised but I thought it was overly dreary and monotonous. Could have been much less so. The tone can be delivered without a nailgun.Two: The ending was SOOOO cheezy! Ruined the whole film. He had to die, that's all fine and dandy, but after he finally releases himself into her, he dies in happiness achieving the one thing he needed? COME ON!! -gag-gag-gag-gag- and that little flashback smiling slow-mo? GIVE ME A BREAK!!! Predictable and sappy. This film should not have *any* sort of Hollywood ending! Would have been absolutely perfect with a better score and without that ending (say if he died as she got there...or if he coughed up a lung while drinking from the bottle and died as she opened the window...killing him in any way is predictable (though necessary) but the less cheezy the better!) So instead of a nine or ten, I give it an 8/10.",Leaving Las Vegas
104,C22Man,Loneliness and Loathing in Las Vegas,6,14 May 2016,"Alcoholism has always been a great device in movies. Over the years there have been many successful films that deal with addiction to alcohol and the devastating effects that come with it (The Lost Weekend, When a Man Loves a Woman, Days of Wine and Roses, to name but a few). It is a serious issue and subject matter, so the films that appear to succeed when tackling the issue are the ones that treat it with the importance it deserves. In saying that, Mike Figgis' Leaving Las Vegas might well be the bleakest of the lot. It features a washed up writer named Ben (an Oscar-winning Nicolas Cage) who heads to Las Vegas with the sole purpose of drinking himself to death. There is little about him gradually succumbing to the disease or how it ruins his family life. It is simply a man submitting to a temptation he can't let go of. For the most part the film is a twisted love story that revolves around self-destruction and the importance of dependency. Ben meets a prostitute named Sera (an Oscar-nominated Elisabeth Shue) who is just as wounded as he is, only she doesn't turn to drink because of it and forces herself to carry on. The two form a relationship that is genuine at its core, despite the fact that neither can change the other which is highlighted when Ben tells Sera that see can never ask him to stop drinking. This inability to change ultimately proves to be their downfall. Their relationship is equally chaotic and bittersweet. Drunken antics and frustration grow more apparent, but there is a clear love between them and in a way it is understandable why two broken people like this would be drawn together. Given how character driven the film is, Cage and Shue are the very centrepiece of the entire film. Cage has always been able to play characters on the edge, but he has a tendency to delve into the excessive a little too frequently. That never happens here. He is completely believable in every expression and motion. It's a wonderfully measured performance as his drunkenness never goes too silly and contemplations never get too dour. Shue is his equal in every way. She has always been an actress who has excelled at warmth and sincerity, and that really pays off here. She has such a strong expression of compassion whenever she is with Cage that it's very easy to forget that they are only acting. Julian Sands appears in the first half as Sera's pimp (unconvincing Latvian accent in all), but for the majority of the film it is simply Cage and Shue who take up our attention. It's a great credit to both actors that they are able to dominate a near two hour film with such ease. The Vegas they find themselves in is one of bright colours and seedy motels, perfectly suited to the horrid depths that Ben finds himself in. The score, composed by Figgis himself, is usually loud and very jazz-inspired, managing to fit the vivid images that are painted here. As the film progresses I think it does lose some focus. The set-up is executed to perfection and these characters fit together so well as their struggles increase. Everything about their conversations feels natural and expressive that the film struggles to keep this engaging aspect once the relationship begins to crumble. Ben begins to act even more rash because he is angered by Sera's occupation, but it is like he completely forgot their earlier agreement and that's all the more distasteful by the fact that any retreats that Sera makes are because she cares about him so much.As the film reaches its conclusion there is both sadness and hope present. One of them will never change, but there's a chance that the other will. In reflection, Leaving Las Vegas is not an easy film to watch because of how deep its willing to go into such an unpleasant area. Never the less, it is an important piece of cinema and one that resonates because it doesn't pull any punches. Cage and Shue are the true heroes. Both provide career best performances that are filled with sensitivity and pathos, as well as a chemistry that makes their actions all the more credible. Sure the films narrative wanes toward the end, but I truly believe that the power shown in these performances and the intelligence shown in consideration to the subject matter makes the film leave an undeniable impression.",Leaving Las Vegas
105,cofemug,"Callous, and, ultimately, unfulfilling",6,1 July 1999,"I saw this movie, knowing what it was about.  I didn't know what to expect however.  I certainly did not expect something totally happy happy. However, with a movie like this you are supposed to care for at least one of the characters.  Otherwise, the movie has no point.  By the end of the movie, I just barely sympathized with the hooker.  From the beginning Figgs presents the drunk as what he is.  The drunk is a jerk, and has no feelings for anybody else.  He says he can change the first part, what about the second.I could not feel much sympathy or compassion for the prostitute.  She walked into the relationship knowing exactly what to expect.  He comes right out and tells her.  She almost wants to change him, but then remembers him. All of her situations that are meant to evoke sympathy (the rape, the cutting) really just evoke callousness.  I just pretty much said, ""Enh.""  The only scene that did evoke sympathy for the two characters is the scene with the hotel manager, and the landlady.  She should not have been kicked out by both places.  In the end, however, I feel like she grew from the experience.It is the lessons of the movie that actually made me like it, not the feelings.  The feelings were quit fake and almost cliched.  It almost seemed to be riding on the wave that was opposite of ""Pretty Woman.""  It had to match everything high for low.  It was the overall movie, the general story and the lessons that made me like this movie.  They were honest, but the feelings sucked.----------------6",Leaving Las Vegas
106,teh_mode,Surprisingly Wonderful,8,14 March 2006,"Mike Figgis' Drama/Romance is one of those movies that treats loneliness as a condition rather than a feeling. It's a skillful piece of work, managing to mould it's mixture of dark comedy and downbeat tragedy into a fine cocktail of a love story. An emotional, funny and moving experience.Nicolas Cage has made a habit of widening his eyes for a variety of similar roles, but they're not so much wide as they are permanently dazed in Leaving Las Vegas. He is a deeply alcoholic writer, who decides to end his life in a wild Vegas booze-cruise. He is stopped in his tracks when he meets Sera, a hooker whom he picks up in the middle of the gambling Mecca. They share a bond, which compromises both his plans for a drunken death and her relationship with her pimp (Julian Sands and his pathetic Russian accent are luckily dealt an early blow).It's never really made clear what Sera initially sees in Ben - whether she takes pity, was a gift from god or really was wooed by an old drunk - she is his guardian angel, his one last reason to stop walking toward's death's door. She rarely tries to make him stop, her angelic demeanour is more of a comfort to Cage's imbalanced tragi-figure, rather than a messenger. But she, herself has her own moral conflictions. She knows that judging Ben's addictions is hypocritical when she , herself, is employed in a seedy, demeaning profession.The hazy milieu of glittery glamour mixed with a self-loathing glut gives us a brilliant feel into what the main character views when he dazedly explores his surroundings. Vegas may be a acid junkie's dreamboat, but is often an alcoholic's nightmare, filled with a tumultuous atmosphere far too quickly for Ben's pace. His relationship with Sera is reminiscent to Romeo & Juliet, in this case it is the alcohol and the prostitution which denies our lovers' a happy way out. We can share in their delight, but cannot watch them run into the sunset. Ben is certainly not always a sympathetic character. A man prone to do adulterous and futile things in spite of his new found love, he is so overcome by his addiction that he fails to see the horror behind it all. His performance is encapsulating to the point where you don't hate him, you're just disappointed. Maybe even upset.Tragic in a way that surpasses conventional romances, with performances from both Cage and Shue that let us see through their pathos and truly acknowledge the love that the characters come to share. These people have problems often far too conveniently dismissed in topical conversations, but Figgis deals with them in a way that is both touching and sympathetic. In turns darkly comic, earth shatteringly tragic and very very pertinent.",Leaving Las Vegas
107,Solnichka,"Overrated, Self-Indulgent Crap",5,20 January 2006,"Okay, so I plagiarized that headline, but it hopefully got your attention. I don't find story lines about drug users to be all that engaging. Maybe it's because I rarely have empathy or sympathy for those characters: they get what they bargained for - why should I feel sorry for them? You make the bed you sleep in. That being said, Nicholas Cage delivers a performance any mediocre actor could deliver. How many of us have pretended to be drunk before? Probably at least half of us. So why did he win an Oscar? No clue. The Oscar in this year should have gone to Sean Penn for ""Dead Man Walking""; that was a real role very few could play as well. This is a role anyone could have played (kind of like Tom Hanks winning for ""Forrest Gump""). What saves this film is the performance of Elisabeth Shue. She is a character you can sympathize with, although the same argument could be made above (why sympathize with a prostitute?). Well, prostitution isn't a choice for most women; it's a sad necessity. The scene where she is gang-raped by a bunch of teenage punks is appalling, but that's where you heart screams in this one -- not watching a loser drink himself to death. Shue should have won the Oscar, although I don't think Susan Sarandon was undeserving for her role in ""Dead Man Walking"".

108,hbs,"harrowing, depressing movie",8,10 September 2000,"This is a very well done movie that is very hard to watch. The portrayal of an alcoholic by Cage is sanitized both cosmetically (it takes a lot longer to drink yourself to death and you look worse by the time you get there) and emotionally (he's not manipulative enough, although he does a good job with the self-indulgent thing), but I found Shue's performance right on the money. (Perhaps that's because I've known alcoholics and I haven't know hookers, but I think that it's because she doesn't spare herself in the performance.) Shue has moments of astonishing realism in this picture.One user comment found the ""moral tone"" of the movie repugnant, but I just didn't see it the same way. For example, there is a scene where someone at a motel castigates the hooker for the way the hooker and the drunk have behaved; I thought that the person doing the yelling was a fairly sympathetic character, and that that Shue's crushed reaction was perfect -- she's a ""co-dependent"" whose self-indulgent fantasy has had its bubble burst. It's very hard to watch, but you also have to feel sorry for the woman doing the yelling, because it's hurting her to not play along; she wants to but can't afford it anymore.What's really hard about this movie is that there are no happy endings and no lessons learned.

109,murtaza_mma,Nicolas Cage at top of the game,9,15 November 2016,"One wouldn't see a better portrayal of a dipsomaniac in all cinema. Nicolas Cage plays an alcoholic screenwriter who travels to Las Vegas to drink himself to death. Cage clearly is at the height of his acting abilities as he lays bare the wounded soul of a perturbed individual. One seldom gets to witness such honesty in a cinematic portrayal. As a matter of fact, Cage doesn't just portray the character but he actually lives it. Elizabeth Shue complements Cage brilliantly while playing with great dignity the part of a hooker without making it look vulgar at any point in time. To watch Cage and Shue play two outcasts who find solace in each other is an absolute treat. Leaving Las Vegas is a rare film about loneliness that actually celebrates life. The film both reject and embraces love. Roger Ebert summed up the film perfectly: ""Few films are more despairing and yet, curiously, so hopeful as this one, which argues that even at the very end of the road, at the final extremity, we can find some solace in the offer and acceptance of love.""For more on the world of cinema, please visit my film blog ""A Potpourri of Vestiges"".",Leaving Las Vegas

111,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn review,8,11 August 2013,"When speaking of Nicolas Cage, most people wouldn't define him as a good actor. Still, he has had some roles in great movies and he takes his job very seriously. That's probably one of the reasons why he won an Oscar in Leaving Las Vegas for best actor – he prepared for his role by binge drinking, visiting hospitalised alcoholics and filming himself drunk to study his speech patterns.Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage) is a divorced, broke alcoholic who just got fired because of his addiction. He decides to take all his money and move to Las Vegas to drink himself to death. One evening he meets a prostitute, Sera (Elisabeth Shue), and pays her to keep him company. After her abusive pimp Yuri (Julian Sands) is killed, Ben moves in with Sera and they start a strange relationship, agreeing they won't try to change each other.Leaving Las Vegas is not a movie for everyone: it's a depressive story about two good people who realise they are doomed and there's no point in fighting for a change. Ben and Sera feel good when they are together, but Ben can't abandon his addiction, and Sera her job. It also features uneasy scenes of sex, alcoholism and chaos. The movie manages to remind us what a horrible and dangerous disease alcoholism is, mostly thanks to Cage's great performance. Shue is also great as the prostitute Sera, especially when she has to carry the movie, when the story focuses on her because Ben has briefly disappeared. Their impossible love is so believable it's almost painful.The cinematography fits the depressing tone of the movie: almost everything takes place at night, in a city full of lights that don't comfort, or in dark and small rooms – particularly while Ben is suffering the consequences of abstinence, the rooms begin looking claustrophobic, as if there was less and less air with each second that passes. The director Mike Figgis also wrote the music and even played some of the instruments for the soundtrack: his jazz fits the Las Vegas atmosphere beautifully. All in all, you have to be in the right mood to watch this movie since it can easily make you cry, but it's totally worth your time.Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",Leaving Las Vegas
112,Hawkensian,"A somewhat idealised account of alcoholism, but still a thoroughly downbeat one",8,4 November 2012,"Don't get me wrong, this film is thoroughly downbeat, however I feel alcoholism is still slightly sugar coated. The likelihood of Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage) finding a woman as attractive and utterly devoted as Sera (Elizabeth Shue) is slim. It's possible of course, their bond is understandable; they're both people in grave need of care, one being a severe addict and the other being a victim on the fringe of society. Also, the crucial element that makes the relationship and indeed the film work is its general platonicism. Nevertheless, I thought that 'Leaving Las Vegas' is a somewhat idealised account of dire alcoholism. This really struck me in an erotically charged scene in which the pair kiss and caress each other with the help of a large bottle of liquor - it's an image that would exist merely in the dreams of most addicts. However, the engaging central romance certainly beats 2 hours of a more ordinary dive into alcoholism, which would be a film of roughly two sets: a pub and a bedroom stained with urine, excrement, blood and vomit.A film of this nature depends on a good central performance, and it gets one. Cage is depressingly real and effective as Ben. I am a fan of many of Cage's unhinged roles, however 'Leaving Las Vegas' is one the films that proves that when he moderates his idiosyncratic lunacy, he can produce genuinely good, measured performances. The film is scored with smooth, melancholic jazz tracks and the narrative is constructed by a tautly composed prologue which gives a brief insight into Ben's life before he left for Las Vegas. This includes a brilliant scene of Ben ridding himself of his personal and professional existence to the sound of Michael McDonald's energetic 'Lonely Teardrops'. It's a scene of mixed emotions, although he is condemning himself, it is also an act of liberation. Not much detail is given about his life in the prologue, however it is clear that he was a popular and successful family man. When he is fired, his boss says with a touching sincerity 'we enjoyed having you around here, but you know how it is', giving him a cheque which Ben describes as 'too generous'. This depth given to Cage's character makes his decline all the more tragic.'Leaving Las Vegas' is dark, seedy and tragic. Recommended.www.hawkensian.com",Leaving Las Vegas

But I can re-visit and view this work as many times as I like, with it seeming to be the first viewing. Mike Figgis brought together a work of genius. Cage researched the essence of his character to portray it authentically for us. Shue was the icing on the cake in this story. This movie is a mesmerizing experience.

115,Chuck-149,"Incredibly realistic, very credible, an excellent movie",9,19 July 2000,"In today's society, we have many diseases.  AIDS, cancer, tuberculosis... However, a very underrated and, in my opinion, deadly disease we seem to forget is alcoholism.  Being an alcoholic is like being drug-addicted.  You may think it is easy to quit drinking but it is as hard as dropping drugs and once you've stopped taking alcohol, you can't ever have any again or you'll simply go back to alcoholism.  This issue is the principle theme of Leaving Las Vegas.  However, in the movie, we see as well how alcohol can grab a person and this person will never want to quit and even less hear people asking him or her to see a doctor to quit drinking. 
  Prostitution may be considered by many to be something of very low class but for some women, it is the only possibility they have to make some money. Some prostitutes are independent and others have a pimp.  In Leaving Las Vegas, Elisabeth Shue works for a pimp with whom she has a relationship. 
  Finally, the last issue in this movie is love.  Love with a prostitute more specifically.  In 1990's Pretty Woman, Julia Roberts refuses to kiss her clients on the lips to avoid making a connection with them.  In this movie, Elisabeth Shue does not even talk about this for she believes to be strong enough to avoid any relationship that a client may be trying to trigger between him and her because of her love affair with her pimp Julian Sands.  These three issues, alcoholism, prostitution, and love with a prostitute are the center themes of Leaving Las Vegas. 
  The story is simple.  Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage) is a script-writer who has hit rock bottom and upon being released from his job decides to go to Las Vegas to drink himself to death.  There, he meets a beautiful young prostitute named Sera (Elisabeth Shue) with whom he spends the night only sleeping.  He turns out to be Sera's only client that night and gives her five hundred dollars for her services.  Her pimp Yuri (Julian Sands) is very mad but finally gets over it.  Later on in the movie, Ben invites Sera to dinner but she refuses knowing that she must work to bring some money back to Yuri.  However, when she goes back to Yuri, he tells her to leave and never come back.  As she exits the hotel room where Yuri was staying she crosses three men going to Yuri's room.  She goes back to Ben's motel-room and they go off to dinner.  After dinner she invites him to live in her house and when he moves in, Ben explains that if Sera is to accept him into her life, she can never ask him to quit drinking.  And so begins the love story between Ben and Sera.  Nicolas Cage walked home with that year's best actor Oscar and he deserved it.  I believe that any alcoholic could associate himself to Ben.  Elisabeth Shue is equally good as Sera, the sensitive but tough prostitute who accepts Ben as he is without judgment or prejudice.  Mike Figgis's direction is exceptional.  The fast-forwarding of the camera when Ben arrives to Las Vegas add to his drunk state of mind.  But it is definitely Cage's movie all the way.  The movie also tries to send a message which I believe is no matter what people look like, allow them to be themselves and do not judge them and that is all that Ben asks from Sera throughout the movie.  There is a scene in a hotel in the desert where Ben and Sera are kissing and Ben is very drunk and as Ben gets up next to the pool, he knocks down a glass table and breaks it.  A little while after, the owner of the hotel comes to help Sera pick up the mess and she tells Sera she wants Ben and her gone by the next morning.  This scene is exactly the representation of what Ben doesn't want from Sera.    This movie may end a bit in the same way a tearjerker but it has nothing to do with that type of movie.  On the contrary, it is a realistic moral on alcoholism with great performances and direction.",Leaving Las Vegas
116,HanShotFirstGR,Depression: The movie,8,15 April 2021,"Plot:Ben Sanderson, a Hollywood screenwriter who lost everything because of his alcoholism, arrives in Las Vegas to drink himself to death. There, he meets and forms an uneasy friendship and non-interference pact with prostitute Sera.Analysis:The depressing feeling that was promised in this film's summary is the main reason this movie works greatly and remains entertaining yet inspiring for the most part of its runtime. The pessimistic view on life and the tormented souls of the two protagonists are some great foundation to build a memorable film and this movie really took advantage of that.Nicolas Cage is an actor with many interesting career choices, he has participated from extremely artistic projects like Adaptation to cheesy mumbo-jumbo action movies like Con Air, he is an actor that doesn't stuck in a certain genre and that's the main reason he is so loved from the majority of cinema fans, but I think this performance is the one that should remind to everyone how talented and skillful he actually is. This role that gave him an Academy Award is one of the most complicated ones he ever tried to play, it's not just Ben's desperation that should be not only visible but quite scary. A man reaching the bottom of his life is such a depressing and difficult thing to watch and Cage's performance is spot on to deliver exactly that. Elisabeth Shue does a good job completing the (kinda sad) puzzle of the main cast, her portrayal of Sera, an unhappy prostitute seems over the top at first but it actually pays off as the time passes.This is a kinda unique piece of art to be honest, the smooth jazz, the choices of the scenes that were included, the whole heavy theme and all the other elements of Mike Figgis' direction make it the pefect choice to watch something not just fresh and original but also a complete vision with no cliché development. The story is a pill hard-to-swallow, very realistic with intense dark thoughts about life and it will definetely keep you thinking all the time. When a depressing movie is done wrong everything is a mess and the edgy, emo theme will likely leave you untouched, but when it's done right you get some masterpieces and fascinating stories like this one.When you have been at the edge of suicide or even experienced some mild or heavy depression, you will appreciate this movie way more. It's not just a very accurate portrayal of that but also makes you think about this situation. Without promoting alcoholism as a solution, this movie takes a realistic view on the subject and it's really relatable for people that go through these stuff.There are a few misses but the are not important enought to affect the overall quality of the movie. Some minor pacing problems during the second act, some questionable choices and some unanswered questions will definetely leave you wanting just a little bit more, but they are practically non-existent when the whole film is entertaining and well-made.Conclusion:This is a movie you shouldn't skip, it's the best Nicolas Cage we ever got, it's among the most memorable depressing films I have ever scene and it will surely be benefitial for you to expand your knowledge of those problems and have a better look on situation like that. A very important and interesting story that will not leave you bored or uninterested.Rating: 8.5/10.",Leaving Las Vegas
117,WCS02,Leaving My Senses perhaps . . . but there's more here than meets the eye.,10,7 June 2005,"I've seen this film 5 or 6 times. It occurred to me on the last viewing that it could be the ultimate Touched by an Angel  Ben's time in Las Vegas, that is. I believe author John O'Brien thought he was living through a hallucination in the final throes of his diseased life.The possibility rises out of several conspicuous dynamics in the film.First, that Ben's life was invested developing Hollywood drama prior to being dismissed by his boss, who will clearly miss his talent and personality in the office, a talent singularly broken by the ravages of alcoholism. He is good at inventing and developing ""story"". If his occupation had been Investment Banking or Teaching, I'd feel differently. But John O'Brien bore him with a Hollywood mind. That lit the flame for me.That Ben repeatedly calls Sera his angel during his demise - as he enjoys the best of - and endures the worst of - Las Vegas living. It is possible that all of it is a hallucination during the final pathetic act of his life. The invention of Sera makes his passing bearable, doable, a possible goal for him.That Sera endures the college team horrors, discuses her relationship with the off-camera therapist to whom she confesses her soul-deep love for Ben ... even the problems with her pimp and landlord constitute deep back story in the mind of a man with a talent for such invention, desperate to flesh out the reasons why this angel will escort him to the next world. In my last analysis, she is an angel divined in his fertile mind to embody all of the good people and events in his life (the wealth flashback memories, e.g.). Sera has come to take him out while steeling the love in his heart. She sees him for what he is, because that's what responsible angels do.This is a work with metaphor far beyond the veneer of the surface dialog. It's a film demanding to be viewed more than once. Or perhaps, I'm just going nuts, have lost it and I'm hallucinating in my own right.Either way, enjoy. 10 out of 10.",Leaving Las Vegas
118,jimcheva,How much self-destruction can you take?,6,6 October 2021,"Let's be clear: this film is now a classic and if cinema history interests you, you pretty much have to watch it. Also, the two leads are excellent, against a backdrop of an amazing line-up of actors whose excellence has only become more clear since: Mariska Hargitay (as a hooker), Danny Huston (glimpsed as a pommaded bartender), Laurie Metcalfe (unrecognizable as a blowsy motel owner), Julian Lennon (as a bartender)... not to mention Lou Rawls as a CABDRIVER. And Sting's jazz singing is so appropriate and understated you'd think that was all he ever did. The fact remains that this is a relentless, uncompromising film about two self-destructive people. It's not the only one - there's been a few, often successful, filma about addiction, self-destruction since. Maybe because I've watched the process with more than one real-life person I didn't feel exalted, uplifted, touched or informed by watching it here. If there's a moral here, I don't get it. The relationship most reminded me of what Norman Mailer shows us in ""Executioner's Song"", Nicole seeking out really damaged losers and doing her best to take care of them. That turned out well... Not the same ending in this case (though I'm not sure what would constitute a spoiler here), but Dante pretty much wrote the log-line for this film: ""Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here"".",Leaving Las Vegas
119,RachelLone,"Well done, I just love this",8,12 June 2004,"Screenwriter Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage) has just been fired from a film company in Hollywood due to his drinking problems.

He meets Sera (Elisabeth Shue), a hooker. They soon form a relationship in which neither would interfere with each other's chosen path (Though later, at one point, Sera does want Ben to seek help. She can't bear watching him die). They are both miserable people and they just fall in love with each other.

The sad beauty and the bright yet dark atmosphere of Las Vegas are well-portrayed.

It will probably stand as their most dramatic roles since they both have gone on to do a lot less heavy material. I had seen Cage turn in some decent performances here and there but I was really impressed with Elizabeth Shue. When the focus swings around to her I wasn't sure if the movie would fumble but she brings so tragedy and sadness to Sera I was both riveted and wanted to look away.It's tough to recommend but it is undeniably powerful and moving.

126,Doogie D,Well-executed but morally abhorrent,2,26 October 1998,"This is a well-shot movie with two fine performances in the leads, but a moral vision which makes me shudder.  The central idea for the film is that to help someone -- in this case, vital and necessary intervention -- is evil.  All of the people in the movie who call Cage's character on his behavior -- whether it's, hey, don't kill yourself or hey, don't shatter glass around a swimming pool -- are vilified (except a kindly African-American cab driver -- a patronizing bit of racism); the correct attitude, the film posits, is, hey, it's your life, man, whatever.  One suspects a bit of Kevorkian sympathizing going on, but why be so ready to pull the plug?  Is human life so negligible?Too bad -- there's some obvious talent at work, but some terribly misguided enthusiasms -- a romantic view of self-destruction as liberation.",Leaving Las Vegas
127,CarmaChan,"Flawlessly executed, the unbelievable made believable.",10,24 June 2013,"This is a film any decent human being wants to hate. It is a thing no one wanted to watch, and some people had to because they are film critics, or market test groups, or Academy voters. It is one of those repugnant synopses that says, ""You have better ways to spend 2 precious hours of your life. This is madness."" So, what got me to watch it on demand last night? I'll tell you what.I looked up from my laptop, from my shopping and banking and usual Saturday afternoon activities, whilst the tele was on in the living room. I looked up and saw Elizabeth Shue, a familiar face associated with good storytelling. The scene was unfamiliar--a movie I haven't seen?--I watched for a minute. Then the camera moved to Nicholas Cage and the look in his eyes chilled me to the bone. My soul searched for signs of a soul and found none. Nothing. Vacant. Utterly without life. Utterly believable. Gripping. A moment, a five-second shot maybe, a 10-second fixation (who's counting?), that is one of those moments in film history--that moment when you cannot take your eyes away, when you are mesmerized and horrified, filled with dread and pity. Wow. What is this? Hit guide--oh, it's that one--the one about the guy who wants to drink himself to death. Hm. But that moment, my god, wow-- Nicholas Cage, that was stunning. I went to a party that night and it was the first thing I had to talk about--have you seen this film--that moment? It made me want to watch the movie! How could I stomach two hours of watching a drunk? How could I even consider it? I hate drunkenness, it is not entertaining, it is not even a little bit interesting--drunks are boring, obnoxious, pathetic cowards who have checked out. They do the worst thing in the world: bore people. Wear people out. Shackle loved ones with pity and dread, day upon day upon day. How could I watch this?Last night, it was a must-search, and I found it, started it, almost turned away, but that moment compelled me. Here is what is astonishing about the art of filmmaking: every aspect must be in place for the magic to happen. It is more difficult than theater because you have an army to feed, the clock is ticking, the greedy Wall Street dragon is coming after you--all of you--if this is a bomb, your careers will all take a nose dive--it's all about the money at the top. Those greedy narcissists who run our world, who fire producers who greenlight projects like this with their precious investment--heaven forbid they have to give up a second boat! Here, in this movie, the magic happened because everything went clinkety-clink, and there is a reason why the Academy recognized Nicholas Cage for the success of this film as a work of art that moves people profoundly and most unexpectedly! It's this: it all was on his shoulders. If that character wasn't real to us, the whole thing fell apart. If he couldn't make us believe in that guy and fall in love with that drunk, and care what happens to him, it's a flop, someone gets fired, actors phones stop ringing, they don't get called back--they're poison--they did that flop, nobody will ever trust them again. On stage, the next night you can redeem yourself. Not on film, it's a one-time record and you had better get it at the right angle, in the right lighting, with the right music, framing the the whole thing, or it's a shrug. Nobody cares if this guy lives or dies. Nobody believes her reaction. Absolutely stunned. I watched the whole damn thing and was glad I did. More than that--this is a film that made me want to read the novel. That almost never happens to me.",Leaving Las Vegas

By all means, its very well acted and some of the scenes are very engrossing. Nicolas Cages performance is probably oscar-worthy, however, this is only because it was a poor year. His performance doesnt come close to other winners from that decade, such as Antony Hopkins, Tom Hanks or Jack Nicholson. The film is generally quite good. My only problem is that it drags out towards the end and looses its character. Also, there are far too many sex scenes towards the beginning of the film and throughout.

139,Degree7,"Worth watching, but hard to get into.",4,24 October 2013,"There is a lot to admire in Mike Figgis' ""Leaving Las Vegas"". An attractive cast. A great on set location. Competent direction. An original soundtrack by Sting. A relatively honest portrayal of alcoholism that refuses to glorify it. But then again, what films do glorify alcoholism?Compared to pictures like ""The Lost Weekend"" and ""Days of Wine and Roses"", LLV seems a little more romanticized in its depiction of an end stage alcoholic. The cast is far too attractive in every respect. Nicholas Cage looks like he's been working out at the gym for five days a week, and yet he is supposed to be a man in his thirties approaching death after years battling a deadly addiction. End stage alcoholics are supposedly bloated or emaciated ciphers, vomiting, bleeding, and fluidly discharging their way through every violent or truncated relationship they can afford to hold on to. By comparison, this film offers a slightly more sanitized sheen to the whole ordeal. Cage got the shakes and DTs down, I guess, but nothing that would make you lose sleep over seeing. Elizabeth Shue does a solid job as the equally lonely prostitute looking for companionship. But I was never that involved in their supposed 'romance' as I felt I should have been. All of the scenes involving her were a real drag to sit through, and I couldn't help but get the inkling that her character would have been much more engaging if she had been portrayed as a less attractive individual. Maybe more reminiscent of Charlize Theron in ""Monster"", but retaining the heart of gold. Instead, all I saw was ""movie star"" whenever she showed up on screen. Mike Figgis does an admirable job at creating a moody, ethereal atmosphere, but much of the cinematography feels slightly cheap, like this film was made for VHS, and the soundtrack was that typical loungeroom jazz that you'd find in a Casino toilet. Maybe that was a purposeful artistic choice, but it didn't exactly suck me in, except for an excellent montage using Michael McDonald's cover of ""lonely teardrops"".As it was, the film really failed to get going, and the director's choice to frame Elizabeth Shue's fantastic rear and perfectly sculpted body as a substitute for character arc was off putting in hindsight. Would watch once, just for the Cage performance, but not again.",Leaving Las Vegas
140,svikasha,A Grim Love Affair in a Charming Setting,9,22 May 2017,"Hollywood has made a lot of movies about Las Vegas. Iconic films like ""Casino"", ""Ocean's Eleven"", ""21"", and ""The Hangover"", immediately come to mind, conjuring up images of adventure and glamour in the dessert that have captivated the public's imagination for decades. But this is truly a misconception, because the money and glamour of Las Vegas often overshadows the gloomy underbelly that is equally a part of the reality of the city. While Las Vegas continues to be a place where people go to let loose, gambling addiction, substance abuse, and sexual violence also come with the package. This coupled with the isolating loneliness of the dessert, makes Las Vegas a genuinely grim place. ""Leaving Las Vegas"" is one of the few films about Las Vegas produced by Hollywood that capture the true contradictory nature of this gambling oasis. The film tells the story of a self-destructive alcoholic and a naïve escort who find comfort in each other to numb themselves from the pain of their lives. Nicolas Cage plays the alcoholic Hollywood screenwriter named Ben Sanderson who, after burning all of his bridges and losing his job, decides to move to Las Vegas to drink himself to death. In the opening scenes of the film, the extent of Ben's alcoholism is made blatantly self-evident when an out of control Ben chugs down a bottle of Vodka while driving next to a forgiving but judgmental police officer. During one particularly tragic moment, Ben drunkenly narrates to a young prostitute, ""I don't know if I started drinking because my wife left me or my wife left me because I started drinking"". The girl takes advantage of Ben's sorry state and proceeds to steal the man's wedding ring. Ben's love interest in the film has a story that is just as tragic. The female lead Sera, who is played by the Harvard alum Elisabeth Shue, is an escort who works for an abusive pimp at the Las Vegas Strip. After running afoul of eastern European mobsters, it is implied that Sera's pimp is murdered and Sera ends up running into Ben. By portraying the gloomy dark side of Las Vegas as the setting of this doomed love story, the film highlights the qualities of Las Vegas that are usually obscured by the ditzy lights and entertainment. Although the initial encounter between the two characters leaves much to be desired, eventually a charming if not doomed relationship forms as these two free-floating characters try to assuage the pain of their individual flaws. While charming, the film is simultaneously cruel because both the male and female leads have horribly self-destructive tendencies. This leaves the audience with the strange realization that the love affair between these two characters is doomed for failure. Yet, the movie tries to remain hopeful and one can't help but admire both the acting and on-screen chemistry between the two male and female leads.The greatest aspect of ""Leaving Las Vegas"" remains a subtle presence throughout the entire film. The grim nature of the story is hidden by the classical jazz and piano music as well as the upbeat soundtrack. The music is tastefully chosen to stand in deep contrast to the dark and grim nature of the circumstances of the two main leads. Perhaps the raw isolation of the dessert can bring anybody together. As an audience member, one can't help but wonder why these two self- destructive people are together. At one point the movie delivers an answer when the Sera admits says, ""The only thing I have to come home to is a bottle of mouth wash to take the taste of cum out of my mouth. I'm tired of being alone. That's what I'm tired of"". When one puts it like that, who isn't?",Leaving Las Vegas

On the other hand, if you're looking for a film that draws you in and makes you think, then this is a film for you. Cage plays the pathetic drunk extremely well, demanding and receiving no compassion.  Shue on the other hand is the prostitute that's trying to improve her lot in life.

142,noahk,The Least Enjoyable Movie I Have Ever Seen,1,28 December 2001,"Sitting through this film made me rethink how I view movies in general. Although this is a bold statement, I don't mean it as praise for this film. Quite simply, I found it so horrible to watch, it made me realize that I generally go to movies primarily to be entertained.  Sure, sometimes I might be in the mood for something thought provoking, rather than outright entertaining, but ""Leaving Las Vegas,"" was neither as far as I'm concerned.The story essentially is about a man (Nicholas Cage) who, despite success in his career, has seemingly lost his family due to his drinking, and he has made a decision to go to Las Vegas and spend the rest of his money as he intends to kill himself drinking.  In Las Vegas, he meets an unlikely kindred spirit in a hooker (Elisabeth Shue), and they embark on a rather untraditional relationship with nothing positive to be gained as a result of it.The initial problem for me was, I didn't like either the characters or the premise.  I found Cage to be without any value whatsoever and the movie would have been much better (and shorter, albeit entirely unnecessary) if he had just killed himself immediately and spared the audience from having to watch it.  I had no empathy for him and the sad situation he had gotten himself into.  Shue was slightly less pathetic, I suppose, but I still didn't find myself caring what happened to her.  I'm not sure what about Cage's performance made it worthy of an Oscar-- he just acted like himself but a little bit dopier.. big stretch!  Overall, I found it an extremely unpleasant film to watch (to put it mildly) and I resented having wasted $10 on tickets and over two hours of my life suffering through it.  I have never hated a movie with a passion as much as this one.  Not recommended for anybody, as I fail to see what one could derive from such a movie.  Rating: 1/10",Leaving Las Vegas

Near impossible access to vicarious emotions played out with the most effortless conviction. Stunning!,Leaving Las Vegas
144,garage5inc,They are gone,8,23 December 2002,"Leaving Las Vegas is a very surreal movie about two people who cannot and will not leave their lives that are killing them physically and mentally. Nicholas Cage is an alchoholic who decides to move to Vegas after he loses his job and his family, he sells all his possesions so he can have money to buy hard liqours. Elizabeth Shue is a prostitute who has been beaten in the past and keeps hooking despite the abuse from clients. The two meet each other kind of like in ""Pretty Woman"" where the man just wants to talk and wants to get to know the girl. This movie however is anything but a cheerful film where the two people come to terms at the end. Shue takes Cage in and lets him live at her house, he still drinks and she still hooks. Throughout the time Cage's character becomes physically dependant on the alchohol, whenever he stops his body produces violent tremmors where he is forced to drink more and more. Shue can't stop Cage from drinking, but she knows it will kill him very soon, so she accepts it, as he as accepted her for the person she is, without ridicule or question. The two finally show their love for each other completely in the last minutes of Cage's life. Very sad film to watch, but I recommend it.",Leaving Las Vegas
145,stephenpaultaylor,could have been better,6,25 February 2005,"I saw this film when it came out and I remembered enjoying it more. I just watched it again last night and I have to be honest; I was a bit let down. The acting (esp. Nicholas Cage) was top notch, the story sad and tragic, but other elements just brought the whole thing down a notch.For one thing, I didn't find myself very moved by the whole experience. It's a moving, tragic tale, and the night before I shed a few tears during Elephant Man, but not with LLV. And I have to attribute part of it to the music. I learned that Mike Figgis composed the film himself, but for me, it was just too jazzy and bluesy to really work for the film and the story. Elements of that genre would've worked, but I just found myself annoyed by the music again and again, and instead of emotionally connecting with the characters, I felt distant; detached.The little blurry bits and the slow motion bits seemed too artificial; too forced. Too self-consciously ""arsty"", and, for me, really detracted from the story. If the story was a little more ""sober"" (get it?) in the way it was told, I may have been drawn in more.But it's a story of alcoholism and self-destruction, ultimately, and my one question would be why the film didn't choose to go more into Cage's reasons for killing himself with alcohol. It's never satisfactorily explained.Nevertheless, despite the jittery camera and cheesy music, the story is poignant, terribly sad and surprisingly low key, and Cage has some great lines, especially in the first half of so.",Leaving Las Vegas
146,Melrosemiss,Wonderful performances by Cage and Shue,9,26 June 2019,"I would have to say this may be the most depressing movie I have ever seen, followed quickly by Long Day's Journey into Night and Sophie's Choice. However, the performances cannot be faulted in any way. If it did not wear me down so emotionally, there would not have been a 15 year hiatus from the last time I saw it. I am grateful that we have come to acknowledge that alcoholism is a disease. Cage looks like death warmed over so be ready for that. If you are a Nicolas Cage fan (and I do appreciate his genius), this is a must see. Maybe not the best movie to watch after watching Taking Chance and the Angel Flight video, but worth your time.",Leaving Las Vegas

Ben(Nicolas Cage)has only one thing to do in his life after he lost his wife and job,to drink,drink and drink himself to death.Sera(Elisabeth Shue) is a soft hearted hooker who failed to resist herself from Ben.Throughout the movie Stings music has been wonderful which really added flavor's to such a sad and touching story.This movie is all about 'lonely hearts' who don't have anybody to care for,for those who have given it up all no worry,no happiness,no emotions but only to live and die in the same moment.....",Leaving Las Vegas
148,Diego_rjc,Cage and Shue in the best parts of their careers,9,23 March 2010,"Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue are actors that aren't well-known for their acting itself, but more for the sex-appeal they both have. Cage is widely known for his roles in comedy movies (like in the Coen Brothers' 'Raising Arizona') or action flicks, like 'The Rock' or 'Conair'. Shue was discovered in 'Karate Kid' and was also in the 'Back to the Future' trilogy, but never giving a strong performance. But in 1995, both Cage and Shue proved they could act in Mike Figgs' 'Leaving Las Vegas'. This movie gave Cage his first (and only) Oscar, and Shue her first (and only) nomination. Their roles in this movie are still considered today the best parts in both careers.'Leaving Las Vegas' follows the story of Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage), a man that, after his wife runs away with his children, starts to drink, a lot. Now, after he lost his job and has nothing more to do with his life, he decides to go to Las Vegas to, according with his own words, ""drink himself to death"". In Las Vegas, he meets a prostitute named Sera (Elizabeth Shue), and moves in with her, forming a beautiful, but problematic friendship. 'Leaving Las Vegas' script is based on a novel by John O'Brien, an American author that was also an alcoholic and shot himself to death only two weeks after the movie's production began. Some people say that the character of Ben Sanderson represents the urge of the author to drink himself to death, and I agree with them. One could've only wrote such sad and deep characters on depressive times. Throughout the whole movie, the author discusses themes such as alcoholism, rape, prostitution, etc, but always in a very subtle, almost gentle way. The dialogs are simply fantastic, and the story develops in a remarkable way. O'Brien's novel was adapted here by the own Mike Figgs', who was Oscar-nominated for his work.The strongest point of 'Leaving Las Vegas' is, indeed, the acting. Aside from Cage and Shue, any other actor here have big roles. The only one with a little more screenwriter was Julian Sands, as Yuri, Sera's pimp. And Julian Sands delivered a good performance, but that's not nothing compared to the job of the two main actors of the picture. Nicolas Cage was almost perfect as Ben Sanderson, giving one of the best drunk-man interpretations of all time. The second best, if you ask me, only behind Ray Milland's job in Billy Wilder's 'The Lost Weekend'. His voice levels, his body movements, everything seems so perfect for a drunken man. And even when Ben Sanderson isn't drunk, Cage managed to give such depth to the character that it's impressive. One particular scene where Ben goes to the bank in the morning but still haven't had a shot, really blew me away. That scene proved all Cage's talents, and beyond. He completely deserved the Oscar he got. My only wish is that he does more serous roles like this, but that seems unlikely, considering his filmography nowadays. Elisabeth Shue was also excellent in the role of the prostitute Sera. She wasn't better than Nicolas Cage, but she came real close. I haven't seen 'Dead Man Walking', so I can't really say if she deserved the best Actress Oscar-award more than the winner for that year, Susan Sarandon.Aside from his nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay, Mike Figgs was also nominated for his directing job in this picture. and it is truly great indeed. The way Mike Figgs makes the audience connect to all those characters is incredible. Notice how the actors are almost always is close-ups, and if they are not, how the camera is far away from then. Figgs utilizes the music in a perfect way, also. All those Jazz ballads fit into the movie like a glove, and they are all composed by the own Mike Figgs and sung by Sting. Figgs utilized the music specially to increase or decrease the dramatization of each scene, to make the audience feel sorry or not for these two characters. Each scene has also a strange and sad look, thanks to the nice cinematography by Declan Quinn. Overral, I really liked 'Leaving Las Vegas'. Of course the movie isn't perfect, but it serves as an excellent character study, showing all the dangers of alcoholism or prostitution. Mike Figgs' job is truly remarkable in here, not only for the adaptation of John O'Brien's novel, but also for his directing and composer jobs. But the movie is really marked because of its two main stars, Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue, because the movie shows that they both can act, in the best parts of their careers. 9/10",Leaving Las Vegas
149,tomosp1965,"The best champagne, film wise!",9,28 April 2015,"Wow, wow, wow! This is a cracker of a film. It tells the story of an alcoholic in ways that even a non drinker could understand.Nicholas Cage 'Ben', is exceptional in the role as the self inflicted, jobless alcoholic. Its as if this role was written for an actor with his zany, unpredictable and rugged way of portraying a character. He is convincing, giving a brilliant insight into the futile world of an addict, and so I felt pity for the character, even though he was beyond help. Elisabeth Shue 'Sera', is also excellent and shows us that society's rejects maybe the nicest people to know. Julian Sands 'Yuri', gives a great performance in the menacing role of the pimp, giving the film tension, whilst making the viewer feel fear for the life of Sera.There are a few problems with the film, but not enough to bother the viewer.This is a sad film and I ask that you have tissues available when the end of the film comes.One of my favourite movies and deserving of 9 out of 10.",Leaving Las Vegas

154,mr composer,Critically acclaimed film devoid of entertainment,5,24 December 2004,"You'll have to excuse me if I am hesitant to jump on the bandwagon of films like these, even though the elite film critics suggest that I should. It seems there have always been extreme classes of movie watchers since the era of films began. There is the class that finds ""Armageddon"" and the theatrical ""How the Green Dog (I mean Grinch) Stole Christmas"" as the definition of a good film. Then there are those who think that a film is only good when it is harsh, uncompromising, filled with tragedy, portraying ""realism"". In these movies, the merit comes from the acting and dialog. Anything else remotely entertaining classifies it as an artless Hollywood film.I myself like to wander in between categories. I enjoy good Summer movies, but acknowledge them like great tasting junk-food. I also enjoy the deeper, more intelligent, artistic films that draws flocks of critical praise. Yet, when films such as ""Leaving Las Vegas"" are considered the best films of good movie years such as 1995, it makes me wonder much about the people who harbor such opinions. Is your life so good that you need hopelessness portrayed on the screen as a change of pace? Is your life as bleak as Nicholas Cage's and Elizabeth Shue's character that you need to see it visually to feel validated in your own decisions? Do you hate ""unrealisitic"" hope-filled movies because you have no incentive to change your own life? Does seeing this movie actually make a positive difference in your life? Movies have always had two purposes for me: entertainment and education. Really good movies (best of a certain year) do both. ""Leaving Las Vegas"" did neither for me. I cannot deny that there are powerful scenes nor that the two lead actors are first-rate. The dialog is also engaging. Yet, here lies a movie that shows the ugliness of throwing your life away without any hope of change. It is this colored with harsh profanity and unpleasantness and labeled ""true to life"".To whom is this movie for? People I know personally do not act like this or speak like this. Real life for me is filled with hope and dreams. It is about going through trials and overcoming them. Watching a movie that makes me feel unpleasant from beginning to end without one ounce of inspiration is not a way to spend two hours of my time. How can this film be considered greater than ""Braveheart?"" That is a movie that is also considered a tragedy, yet on the way is filled with love, adventure, dedication, and hope. It does what a movie should do. Filmmakers, let's make high-quality films without thinking we need the bleakest point-of-view to classify it as a great work.",Leaving Las Vegas

I'll admit to having been around enough drunks to know that Cage's portrayal was quite accurate, but the aspect that reinforces the audience's sympathy for him to the end is also a weakness in the movie: He's a hunk, still, to the end. All the ravages of alcoholism on one's personal, financial, social, and,(for the most part),love life don't amount to a hill of proverbial beans if you can maintain your lean muscular physique, smooth complexion, perfect teeth and hair throughout the abuse, and still be able to make love when you're on death's door. As well as Nick did on many personality characteristics of this performance, I think I'd prefer to see Mickey Rourke in this one.

If you want to see messed up addicts, you can always watch Cops reruns.I read the many comments by people who loved the acting and the drama.

It's a story without direction or hope or consummation. It is a small, sad tone poem about people who cannot cope. But with all that premise, with all the mood enhancing jazz, and the seedy, empty, soulless backdrop of Las Vegas, nothing truly happens for the viewer. There is no story. There is no drama. There is no understanding. Yes we recognise these people, and yes there is an honesty and a truth about Elisabeth Shue's performance that is impressive. But scratch the surface and there is nothing there. Maybe that is what we should take away from the movie, the emptiness of the whole thing, but I would have liked a little more.

The the lead player, Cage and Shue, were honored for their acting is almost as amazing. The story is trite: an alcoholic and a prosty hook up in Vegas, where everything stays, not for a sexual encounter, but for emotional support. I'm okay with that. But the screenplay and the acting are too far beyond belief to make the picture one that I couldn't wait for the end. Cage's alcoholic is a buffoon and his behavior defies realistic behavior of the lush. He surrounds himself with every kind of booze imaginable, the serious drinker is a one brand user. He chugs a pint out of a bottle, a real alchie wouldn't and likely couldn't drink that way. Ms. Shue plays an experienced hooker, and does anyone believe that a pro would take three wild college kids into a room for tricks? Come on.

165,JimS_8686,Drunken Cage: A Cross Between Peter North & Arthur,1,19 April 2009,"I am not quite sure why Leaving Las Vegas was held in such high regard upon it's release in '95. This film was an abysmal failure in just about every respect. I guess if you enjoy seeing beautiful women bare their breasts frequently, the film will succeed for you on some level. But Nicholas Cage's character is pulling more trim than James Bond. He can pound a 5th quicker than Blutarsky, while operating a motor vehicle with such precision that he can outsmart a cop on a motorcycle who actually happens to witness him chugging vodka while driving down the Vegas strip. I guess the moral of this movie is: any slim, middle aged guy with a receding hairline could wallow through life acting like a pitiful drunken buffoon with a tolerance that would probably have eclipsed Farley's, and have gorgeous women constantly throwing themselves at them.The problem here is with the casting. Perhaps I would have been able to take this material more seriously if Brad Pitt, Johnny Depp, or Zac Efron were cast instead of Cage. But even then, you're still faced with the dilemma of asking yourself: why a would a person want to kill themselves when they have all these beautiful women aggressively forcing themselves on them 24/7. Elisabeth Shue channels Jennifer Jason Leigh as the hooker with a heart of gold. Her relationship with Cage does not amount to much more than mutual self pity for one another. Cage and Shue's chemistry seems forced. The film's frank and explicit sexuality appear to be the main selling point. Leaving Las Vegas may be memorable in terms of shock value and pushing R-rating boundaries, but that is pretty much it. Literally every scene will leave the viewer scratching their heads. At the beginning of the movie, Cage is in a liquor store filling his cart to maximum capacity with top shelf liquor, and then in the very next scene they show him in a seedy bar begging the bartender to pour him another shot. The scene where Cage crawls to his refrigerator and fumbles for a beverage is supposed to be a serious moment depicting the hell of going through DT's as a result of severe alcoholism. But Cage's idea of ""method acting"" in this scene is apeing Jim Carrey from Ace Ventura Pet Detective . Cage convulses violently as if he just grabbed a live electrical wire after getting out of swimming pool every time he takes a swig. There is another scene at a casino where Cage wants a drink real bad and he loses it, flipping over a blackjack table in the process. Cops politely, gently escort him away with genuine sympathy. Even the dealer looks like she has fallen under Cage's spell. Whether it's a cop or a hooker, everyone Cage encounters in Vegas seem like they are extremely concerned, & care for him deeply. Even a friendly bartender working in a dive bar which gets little business refuses to serve Cage and begs him to seek help. Nobody ever seems the slightest bit annoyed by his buffoonish drunken antics - save for woman who runs a hotel and kicks them out after Cage shatters a glass table outdoors. Shue's character seems flabbergasted that the hotel manager isn't ready to take a bullet for the two of them.Don't let Cage's Oscar win fool you. Leaving Las Vegas is a pedestrian effort in every respect. Upon it's release, Mike Figgis was hailed by critics as the next Scorsese. 14 years later, he is unheard of. Perhaps one could conclude LLV was a bit overrated upon it's release, and did not hold up over time. That person would be correct.Top it all off with a terrible original score by Sting.

Man, was I WRONG! The depth of his acting hit me in the face so hard (Auch!), that I was instantly hooked on to this movie from the very first minutes. (Because I roughly knew what the movie was about.) I had never ever before seen him put so much effort towards acting. The way he was as a suicidal drunk, was something I could actually relate to at the moment that I was watching the movie. (I had done some boozing over the weekend, and had this surreal hangover. Hehe.. Not those kinds of when you feel sick, but when you feel momentarily satisfied.) And altho this man finds a woman that has feelings for him and vice versa, his self determined 'fate' can't be changed by anyone or anything. Not even love. It's that final. I had this feeling that -of course- he'd eventually 'wake-up and smell the roses', but NO! This totally surprised me! The closing scene is unforgettable: He's barely in his senses when she comes to him. Dispite that, his hand reaches for the bottle one last time. Maybe thinking: ""Time to finish what I came here to do."" Then he exhales his last breath. Unforgettable. It's a touching film about a man, who simply has no longer the need to live.

171,Cherubin,as mixed as the drinks,8,13 April 2003,"After seeing ""Leaving Las Vegas"" for the second time, I truly have mixed feelings about it.  Initially, I thought that  Cage never acted convincingly drunk in it and that if he really drank that much, he´d be dead in the film´ first 20 minutes most likely from inevitably crashing his car  due to drinking extremely large amounts of vodka in it. However, later I learned that the most extreme alcoholics develop such a high immunity to alcohol´s effects that alcohol makes them act relatively normal more than anything else. When under the influence then, Cage´s character acts calm but also unfocused, silly ,  crazy, and irresponsible. When he has too little alcohol in him, he gets worse shakes than anyone kicking a harder drug. Whether all this is accurate, I really don´t know now. His relationship with the Elisabeth Shue character can be touching at times, especially in the scene when she lets him stay in her apartment and he gets a truly grateful smile on his face as a result. However, the movie would have actually benefitted from an extra hour or at least more touching moments because the relationship is presented as  too quick and choppy for the viewer to fully sense it´s importance (even though the Shue character says how important it is to her at least three times to hammer this point home).  However, the most striking thing about the relationship is that we get the sense that the two characters could really change their dead end lives around if they made the effort, even though the process would be very hard.  However, as things rarely change for the better unless we actively want them to, we witness these two characters helplessly watch their lives fall apart because their attitude towards their lives is one of surrender. I also have similarly mixed feelings about the film´s overall style and atmosphere. On one hand, presentations of seedy urban blight can be artistically pleasing. Las Vegas is presented as sublimely in its bleakness as  for example, the cities  in ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Heavy Traffic"". However, ""Leaving Las Vegas"" is obviously specifically calculated to shock the viewer. Seriously, is it really necessary to watch Shue take a number one or to hear her describe deviant sexual practices to know that the characters live rough ? Also, is pessimism really realistic or do  tragedies resonate more  in a world that is neither good nor bad ? It actually seems the ""LLV"" loses much of its shock value by saying that whatever bad or sickening things happen, it is normal to expect them.  Still, who´s to say that such a view is 100 % wrong ?  This movie is definitely food for thought.",Leaving Las Vegas
172,peterlonglongplong,A truly impassioned dreamscape for the overly - happy people.,2,26 April 2007,"I gave this movie a step above ""awful"" because the acting was good at times, in spite of the fact, the storyline is preposterous. Shue - a prostitute? Yeah, that's possible. A Las Vegas street walker looking like Shue? Maybe as often as somebody winning $200,000,000. A Las Vegas street walker falling in love with a pathetic drunk? PLEASE!!! What planet are they from??? A seasoned Vegas street ho would see how much money she could bleed from the idiot loser, and then she'd boogie away like sprinter in the Olympics. She would lose her concern for the idiot drunk loser at the first stoplight she comes to. The movie does little to explain why Ben is so depressed that he has to drink himself to death. It does nothing to explain the hooker's story. A ridiculously pretty street ho who loves to suffer, but doesn't do drugs..? She also seems to have just finished a fashion model's photo shoot. She stays wonderfully fit for a street ho. I've worked and partied in a west coast city for years, though not as much now, and I'd love to have that girl I knew as Coco give her analysis of the Shue character. I waited through the whole sick movie just to see if anything worth a spit would astound me. Nothing came....nothing at all.....wow.... A true drunk buying all of these different types of hard liquor, and drinking Budweiser??? I understand the entertainment industry wanting to exaggerate somewhat, but come on.....?..... Don't any of these producers realize that many members of the viewing public personally know an out & out drunk, or two? The guy's acting like an idiot drunk through most of the movie (or is that ALL OF THE MOVIE???). Although Cage can act decently in some roles, he's not the most believable drunk; I've known quite a few. The bar scene where Cage has a girl turn on to him to make her boyfriend jealous is possible. It happened to me in '91 in Sacramento, CA. But there was no blood, and the prick left fast, before I could hit him back. Like a puppy dog, she bounced out after him. I believe this could have been a good movie. Too many things were completely unexplained and there was never a happy moment for the characters. I don't understand how anyone could feel any true empathy for such unrealistic, masochistic characters. I guess overly - happy people can feel entertained and educated by an unbelievably unrealistic ball of crap.",Leaving Las Vegas

But Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue are riveting to watch here. As a person who has a past involvement in alcohol and substance abuse, I found Cage's performance especially compelling, and after watching him in this one, I am sure glad that lifestyle is behind me!The chemistry between these two is really great, two people that need each other in different ways, trying to cope with how screwed up their lives have become. Very real performances, if you're faint-of-heart be ready for some strong words, and not just obscenities. Wow! They really lay it on the line. Great performances by two of my favorites.",Leaving Las Vegas
174,ninja_superstar-1,The obviousness of the plot made me less sad,7,16 September 2005,"Cage and Shue perform wonderfully together and with deep respect for their characters' loneliness and vortex of loss. The movie succeeds both as a love story and a tragedy. All of it is summed up when Ben (Cage) looks up to Sera (Shue) and says, ""You can never, never ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?"" Ben's face captures the certainty of the proximity of his mortality and the eternity of his sadness: This is not an overstatement. The movie is that sad.Yet I am angered by the mediocre production of such a great story. The editing is odd and renders a choppy, far too predictable plot. For a sad movie to work completely, something at least must remain unexpected. Likewise, the viewer cannot totally be absorbed by the film, because there is too much movement between the action of the present and that of the future. Usually, such movements build the drama rather than act as tangents. It feels thrown together at times. Not only that, but the viewer goes many minutes without hearing from one of the main characters, Ben. Sure, he's off drinking somewhere, but where? And what does it look like again? Show us! Some of the expendable characters' stories detract rather than add to the film. What is the point of Yuri (Julian Sands), Sera's pimp, in the long run? He takes up too much time in the film and eventually he and his story leave the film entirely. And Dennis Miller's face atop every taxi is just distracting.Why does nearly every female character either look like, act like, or actually is a prostitute? The only female voice of reason in the film is a fed up hotel manager.In the end, the movie can't decide if it is Ben's or Sera's story, yet I suspect that we are to think of the story as hers. I generally forgive the films its faults, but I'm just not as sad as I know I could be had the film been better produced.Kudos to Cage and Shue.",Leaving Las Vegas
175,damienmuldoon,wonderfully different,8,16 November 2005,"***MAY CONTAIN SPOILER**** This is a film that I am very glad to have in my video collection. It is moving, sometimes humorous and always engaging. Nicholas Cage (an actor for whom I have no great fondness) turns in the performance of a lifetime as an alcoholic Hollywood screen writer. As the plot progresses we find that his alcoholism is about more than self indulgence though. Personal demons torment him and the worst of these is his capacity for self destruction. Heading for Vegas once he has lost his job, Cage's character hopes to ""drink himself to death"" in that soulless city. However, his quest for self destruction is put on hold when he meets and falls in love with a prostitute, played superbly by Elisabeth Shue.The unlikely couple embark on a reckless relationship, propping one another up against the ugly reality of both their lives. At some level, this film is a study of loneliness and a stark introduction to society's saddest souls. One might imagine it as a two actor stage play. It is also thoroughly entertaining and thought provoking.",Leaving Las Vegas

177,anasismael,Unbelievable Nicolas Cage ❤,9,25 September 2018,"Oh, this movie is so sad! It is sad not because of the tragic lives of its characters, but because of their goodness and their charity.What moves me the most in movies is not when something bad happens, but when characters act unselfishly. In ""Leaving Las Vegas,"" a man loses his family and begins to drink himself to death. He goes to Vegas, and there on the street he meets a prostitute, who takes him in and cares for him, and he calls her his angel. But he doesn't stop drinking.The man's name is Ben (Nicholas Cage). The woman's name is Sera (Elisabeth Shue). You will not see two better performances this year. Midway in the film someone offers Ben the insight that his drinking is a way of killing himself. He smiles lopsidedly and offers a correction: ""Killing myself is a way of drinking."" At one point, after it is clear that Sera really cares for him, he tells her, ""You can never, ever, ask me to stop drinking."" She replies in a little voice: ""I know."" The movie is not really about alcoholism. It is about great sad passion, of the sort celebrated in operas like ""La Boheme."" It takes place in bars and dreary rented rooms and the kind of Vegas poverty that includes a parking space and the use of the pool. The practical details are not quite realistic - it would be hard to drink as much as Ben drinks and remain conscious, and it is unlikely an intelligent prostitute would allow him into her life. We brush those objections aside, because they have nothing to do with the real subject of this movie, which is that we must pity one another, and be gentle.",Leaving Las Vegas
178,-Peter-,Brilliant,9,26 July 2005,"In the same league as ""Body Heat"" a dark film noir about a man who wants to drink himself to death after losing his wife & family, his work and his perspective on his future. In las Vegas he meets a hooker, and that's where the film is about. The story of 2 people that despite their problems and misery only have each other, the hooker who finds love and someone to feel good with, and Ben someone who admires him, despite his alcoholism. I think this was an amazing and depressing film that certainly deserves to be at least in the top 250 here. Sometimes films give you goosebumps, you feel so absorbed like you're living it. This is such a filmA masterpiece",Leaving Las Vegas
179,joeydean61869,"Not entertaining, just arresting and remarkable!",9,22 November 2006,"**** out of **** starsLeaving Las Vegas is not entertaining, but that is not to say that it isn't arresting, or gutsy, or one of the most remarkable films of the 1990's.We can see the choice potential in both the lead characters in Leaving Las Vegas, but the pollution of their souls makes positivity unattainable. Ben, played by Nicolas Cage, destroys how far the average person might think a drunk can separate himself from sobriety. Ben drinks as if it will grow him a missing limb, or change his DNA to suit him better. Through his constant intoxication we see the misguided goodness in him. Whenever we care about a wretched character in a film, the person playing that character is usually deserving of an Oscar, like De Niro in Raging Bull or Theron in Monster. The same applies here. This is a brilliant, Tour-De-Force performance by Cage.Let's not forget Elisabeth Shue who plays Sera, a susceptible yet street-wise Las Vegas hooker. We watch snippets of Sera divulging her painful life as a prostitute as well as her growing relationship with Ben to a faceless and voiceless therapist. Through this one-sided conversation, we learn that Sera is intelligent, cerebral and lonely, yet too scarred from her enigmatic past as a Hollywood street-walker to ever quit her profession.When Ben first approaches Sera for sex, she discovers that his soul is in need of companionship, not his body. It's poignant that the person Sera falls for is one she never sleeps with. Ben's inebriation paralyzes his ability to be physical, but it matters not. Their relationship is purely spiritual with the potential to become even better, but instead it becomes worse, because Ben and Sera are incapable of repairing themselves from drunkenness and emotional torment.Julian Sands plays Sera's pimp, a loathsome, scheming Russian named Yuri. Yuri is a marked man and the Author's device to show us a character much more despicable than Ben or Sera could ever be. The thugs who are hunting Yuri, as well as Yuri himself, haphazardly cross paths with Ben, but he doesn't know their purpose let alone who they are. I believe these run-ins are instruments to solidify Ben's destiny with Sera. Darkness leads to brightness, then darkness again, then both.Director Mike Figgis (Internal Affairs, The Browning Version) doesn't create Las Vegas...he shows us what it really is: a city of greed and indifference. It's the worst place for Ben to be. Perhaps that's why he chooses to go there. Drinking himself to death is not a cry for help, it's truly what he wants to do, he simply doesn't know why he wants to do it anymore because of so much abuse.The slow, moody jazz throughout the film juxtaposes perfectly with the story. Ben, like the music, never brightens, but has MOMENTS of brightness. Sera isn't his soul-mate as much as the melodies are.If you long for feel-good endings, or if you expect characters to always have positive development, do not watch this film. Leaving Las Vegas separates people who ""love movies"" from true film enthusiasts. I bet I'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who would say that Bens and Seras don't exist in the world. Cinema is able to share any story, no matter how foreboding...and apologies are not necessary in doing so.",Leaving Las Vegas
180,cecrle,big disappointment,4,18 December 1999,"I had heard that this movie was great and depressing.  I mostly just found it to be a disappointment.  Cage as an alcoholic intent on drinking himself to death, and Shue as a prostitute intent on whoring--not that we know *why* or anything.  The best scenes of the movie are when Cage's character fires quips and witticisms in the midst of his drunkenness.  But it's not very depressing, because we just aren't given enough information about the characters to care; Cage is drunk from the start, and never really stops, so it's not like we're witnessing the downfall of some great character.  All we know about him is that his wife and son left him somehow, and that Shue has a deranged pimp and keeps on whorin'.  That's about it.  They proceed to act screwed up and hopeless, as *Sting* sings tepid love songs on the soundtrack (yes, *Sting*).  The soundtrack selections are so silly, they really ruin the mood of certain scenes--when we would naturally be feeling glum or sorry for the characters, there's goofy jazzy crooning and crap going on in the forefront of the sound; music that says, ""Oh, those crazy kids!  What wacky things will they do next!""  Does not go well with the visual aspects and storyline at all (unless you consider songs playing that mention ""kissing"" and ""love"" as the same stuff happens on the screen to be an amazingly creative example of synchronicity and visual-aural interwinement).  Very poor, and downright harmful to the atmosphere.  By the time the flick ends, you realize: ""hey.....nothing much happened in that movie...""  Yes, the acting is pretty damn good from both Cage and Shue, but their characters aren't examined/explored/explained enough for us to get any sort of attachment or lasting interest invested in them, and nothing much happens in terms of plot.  Cage keeps getting drunk, Shue keeps whoring, and every now and then something a-little-more-screwed-up-than-screwed-up happens. That's about it. Maybe the best things about this movie could be summarized and translated into a piece of some other excellent film, but in and of itself, this movie is blatantly lacking.",Leaving Las Vegas
181,Aphostile,"Watchable, but profoundly unrealistic with motives lacking.",5,20 February 2003,"(WARNING: COMMENTS CONTAIN SPOILERS)This was one of those movies I could sit through without feeling like I totally wasted my time, but it was begging for realism and more of a sense of purpose. I might have been annoyed if I had paid anything to see it but I just caught it on cable the other day.While they may have thought they were leaving it open to viewer interpretation, I wanted to know exactly why this man wanted to drink himself to death and it is never clearly explained- he doesn't really remember why.Most drunks puke a lot and often over as has been noted in other comments. Most drunks would also fail to capture the affections of a hardened street walker.  Granted nobody wants to pay for a puke fest but the tale was so dark I don't think it would hurt much.I think of Nicolas Cage as a competent, but overrated actor. He did a good job with the role and was much more suited for his role than his femme fatale.  He also had a few lines and scenes which provided some much needed comic relief.  One could be cruel and consider the possibility that maybe he really was drunk during the shooting, but I believe he would have been able to pull it off sober as well.Elizabeth Shue is way too attractive to be a street hooker. While her dedication to the role was commendable and she did it as well as she possibly could have given the mediocre script- she was a definite miscast for the role. A woman that attractive would much more likely be an in call/out call sort that wouldn't need to put up with a pimp daddy taking all her money and physically abusing her. She never seems to be able to get her prices straight either.  Notice they vary wildly throughout the movie and are incongruent with what she explains toward the beginning, bargaining considered. Ever since the AIDS epidemic, most prostitutes insist on condoms if the date is stupid enough not to want one and will not offer to let a john do many of the things she offered in the movie.The absolute high point of the film for me was seeing Elizabeth Shue's breasts but they don't get nearly enough screen time. It definitely could have benefitted from more Shue nudeness.  I was also relieved the ending wasn't of the typical Hollywood cookie cutter type.  Atleast it follows the premise until the bitter end. To me, the film lacks any real message or sense of purpose. I'm reaching here but it came out in a time where the limits of acceptability were being tested and redefined. The process continues to this day, but perhaps in some small way it assisted in redrawing the lines. I gave it 5 stars wishing I could give it a 4.5.",Leaving Las Vegas
182,anupam-satyasheel,A Lump of Gloom,9,4 February 2007,"Watching 'Leaving Las Vegas' can be an experience that takes a gloomy sadness to the interiors of your existence and keeps you immersed in it. As human beings, we consistently put the highest premium on our being alive. Experiencing the intensity of a despondent Nicolas Cage committed to taking his life by drinking himself to death, can trigger off a question as to what can prepare someone for such an act of self-destruction. Intriguingly enough we get no clear answers though there is a clear hint as to it might have been a profound sense of loss or failure.Singular focus on the moribund obsessions of Cage would be gross injustice to the incredibly touching love and empathy that he shares with the lead female protagonist - Elisabeth Shue - who plays a hooker's role with levels of dexterity rarely attained. There is a very deep understanding and mutual acceptance between the two lead characters that is in many ways the true highlight of this movie. Interestingly, we see no reasons for this to exist but such is the articulacy of characterization that not even for a second does one find this profound relationship unrealistic.'Leaving Las Vegas' is an iconoclastic love story whose control over the audience is fascinating. Such is the brilliance of the performances that you feel a lump in your heart by the end of the movie - and this lump transcends into the depths of your being - to stay there and to remind you that unconditional love exists and so does the capability to invite your own death to walk up to you - gradually and consistently. 'Leaving Las Vegas' is a movie that would haunt you for its portrayal of love intertwined with morbid realities of life.",Leaving Las Vegas

184,GrunterGrimm,"A great modern take on ""The Lost Weekend"".",7,27 January 2006,"The camera makes love to the ravishing Elisabeth Shue as Sera the hooker, since her new-found redemption in the form of Nicolas Cage as Ben, is too intent on drinking himself to death to oblige her, even though they are freshly and deeply in love. She's a lonely Vegas hooker and he's in the fast lane to oblivion when they meet and immediately fall heartbreakingly in love as if they were made for each other. He's a Hollywood writer who's drunk himself out of a career and marriage; she's a sweet-hearted loser, and both of them find in each other just what they need while accepting the other for what they are and what they are doing. Cage gives a great performance as a raging alcoholic, as does Shue, as a woman yearning for love and respect.This entertaining, handsomely-produced and well-directed movie had flaws which led me to give it only a seven: a developing and seemingly important sub-plot involving Julian Sands as Yuri, Sera's Russian-gangster pimp is quickly and suddenly abandoned inconclusively, and Yuri is utterly forgotten, while Sera carries on as if she has never had a pimp. Also, very annoyingly, every time Ben and Sera entered their cozy world of togetherness once more, the strains of ""Somewhere, My Love"" began to tinkle and visions of Lara and Zhivago in their icicled love-dacha appeared in my head. And, just like Jennifer Jason Leigh in ""The Machinist"", Shue is just too darn gorgeous and sensitive to play a loser hooker, especially one who doesn't seem to have any hard drugs or deadbeats (apart from Yuri) around to explain why she is selling her body. Nor is there any good explanation of why she has a relationship with Yuri at the beginning of the movie.",Leaving Las Vegas

186,jse126,If you don't suffer from depression yet...,1,30 August 2006,"...then watch this movie and you will. You've been warned. There is nothing to be gained from watching this movie except misery. And not even _good_ misery, of the type that makes you reflect on something, or even teaches you a lesson. No, this is just a bleak movie about people that you could absolutely not care any less about - people that frankly would do us all a favor if they would just kill themselves quietly and not bother the rest us with all of the self pity and drama. Really. As the movie went on I started hating the people that we for some inane reason are supposed to empathize with (that much is clear, given the pretentiousness of this gloopy dreck of a film) - I started hating them so much that I started hating the entire human race and wishing that a giant fireball would incinerate all of us RIGHT NOW. This movie made me feel sick to be a human being. Las Vegas is about the most depressing place on the planet. There is something especially and uniquely depressing about a place so devoid of spirit and purpose in a country that has supposedly made it to the pinnacle of whatever ""it"" is. Far from being a horrible Third World country that by all rights _should_ be depressing (but is not, and is populated by suffering people with hope and spirit), the USA has it ALL yet is filled with empty people with no spirit and no real purpose or direction. Is this what happens when human beings ""make it?"" After they conquer the basic problems of feeding the population and housing them and having running water and all of that great stuff - is this what we end up with? God I hope not. While I don't see it happening in my lifetime, I hope that as a race we can progress to a point higher than where after we get a bit comfy we run out of all ambition and go to places like Las Vegas. Because it is these empty Americans who are the ones who flock to Las Vegas. And the two principle characters in this film are the king and queen of them. The last time that I passed through there (""passed through"" being the operative words here)the oppressive weight of the empty pursuit of the material, coupled with the so blatant advertisement, no, BOASTING of the fact that every single molecule of every fibre of the place is designed solely to take as much as is possible and then a little more on credit from, while giving as little as humanly possible to, people who willingly line up and bend over to donate what little is left over after slaving away for another year in some stupid, mindless job that at the best of times only makes them want to kill themselves a little bit less than they did the previous day - multiplied by the air of desperation from those who still think that they will hit that one big score to finally get ahead, all the while knowing that if they ever do (they don't) they will just give it all back to the Vegas machine; divided by the ones on every corner with absolutely nothing left of life or spirit, nothing left to donate to the machine after giving it their entire life's pittance - once welcomed with open sucking arms but now about as welcome as a broken syringe spilling HIV infected blood into a shrimp cocktail buffet (but still allowed in for a moment to drop that nickel that they found on the sidewalk into the slot machine before being pushed back into the hot and stinking street) - yeah that's Vegas and that last time that I passed through the place was literally crushing the life right out of me, I was on my Hog and I could feel it literally pushing me down and I ran a few red lights to get the hell out of there as fast as possible and today there is nothing in this world that could ever drag me back to the place.So yeah, if you want to watch a movie about a place like that, and that features the two people on Earth who most DESERVE the place and each other weeping and moaning in self pity until you want to punch the television - be my guest. As I said, you've been warned. But I'll give you a little piece of advice that you will thank me for later if you do decide to take the empty trip to Las Vegas instead of leaving it - there is absolutely NOTHING to be gained by forcing yourself to watch this to the end. As soon as it starts to make you sick, and it will, just turn it off and nip in the bud the two day gloom that is otherwise going to drape all over you if you do watch the whole trainwreck. BTW - I don't know what Nick Cage did here to get anyone to award him an Oscar, because his portrayal of an alcoholic was laughable. Hell, I'd give him the trophy for Valley Girl before this mess. His supposedly drunken slurring in this movie sounded like the blithering of one of those old burlesque drunks of the type that Red Skelton and others portrayed - it was quite literally laughable. And it was not realistic either - any alcoholic that far gone with enough money to buy his own booze has a drink of choice and that is it. They don't buy twenty different kinds of liquor, and they only mix drinks when depending on others to supply the booze because mixing makes them sick(er). And I gotta tell you, there is something inherently hilarious about Nicholas Cage not being able to portray a drunk.",Leaving Las Vegas

You could say that Ben had it all but he was always chasing something more elusive - that his family could not provide him.

Especially considering they are both on the fast track to oblivion. They hadn't much but at least they had each other....but not for long - something had to give in this high inflammable relationship.

But Cage finds that he doesn't mind a little company, which comes in the form a traffic-stopping high class hooker (Elizabeth Shue.) There is no sugar-coating here. Cage's descent into abject suicidal -alcoholism is not pretty. His performance is also thankfully free of cliches.

The sound and cinematography and the care with which this film is put together deserve special note.  Treat yourself.,Leaving Las Vegas
190,Malcs,Leaving Las Vegas,10,22 March 2000,"This is a film that is not afraid to deal with despair in the extreme. Nicolas Cage plays Ben, a movie executive who for some reason has lost his family and turns to drink, or, at least that's what he thinks. Early in the film he reveals that he's been drinking so excessively for so long that he can't remember if he drank so much that he lost his family or he lost his family so he started drinking. At the advanced stage of despair Ben is in, it doesn't matter. He is suffering so much he has decided to go to Las Vegas and drink himself to death. He crosses paths with a hooker named Sera, Elisabeth Shue, who instantly feels a bond with him. Why, she can't explain to herself, even though she realizes it IS real. It's important that he simply ""crosses paths"" with a hooker, because his mind is solely on drinking. It isn't until he literally runs into her that the thought crosses his mind that mindless sex could be an enjoyable idea. But Sera feels such a spark with Ben that she realizes he's not just another 'john' but a decent guy who must be in terrible pain. She identifies with him so much because she shares the same type of despair Ben does, and realizes the opportunity to save her own soul by trying to save his, as his ""angel,"" as he constantly refers to her. Trouble is though, that even after he finds his angel, he keeps drinking. In one of the most revealing scenes, the two of them are poolside at a cheap motel and Ben is, naturally, oblivious to her presence because of his soaked mindset. She really wants him to ravish her, so she takes his bottle of booze and pours it over her breasts until, finally, he does. This scene may sound tawdry or corny, but because the two actors have successfully shown up to this point just how much of a bond their characters have, the fact that booze is used as an aphrodisiac here is a major triumph for both of them. They have reached each other halfway.It's been a long time since I've seen two actors portray what real love and understanding looks like on screen. There is something so tangible in this film it almost feels voyeuristic. These characters love each other in such a way that since the hooker's job is, obviously, to have sex with other men, the element of ""cheating"" is moot for her, but when she comes home one night to find that HE has been cheating, suddenly your mind freezes up and you don't know what to think until you remember that outside of quickie oral sex you notice that they've never made love even though they are so obviously and operatically IN love. Wow.In Leaving Las Vegas two of the most down and out characters forge the unlikeliest of bonds and for a fleeting moment experience true love in spite of the money changing hands, money which magically becomes superfluous as their guards are let down to reveal an empathetic passion so real it keeps ascending and swelling, going for a gigantic crescendo. You'll notice that at the beginning of this film you hear blues which slides easily into jazz, and by the end of the film it has transformed into opera. So the range of emotions director Mike Figgis is dealing with on his palette go from despair to sentimentality to operatic overdrive. Opera goes for big emotions and follows them straight through the end. So does this film. It doesn't compromise. It must have been hard to get a film like this made without somebody trying to soften the story or, God forbid, add a different ending. You can imagine some Hollywood producer saying that at the end they should traipse off arm in arm to the Betty Ford Clinic so everything will be all right. But because the budget of the film was what it was, not too many people had the right to dabble with the script.This script is so good, based on the novel by John O'Brien (who committed suicide just before production on the film began) that at various times on the soundtrack when it fades out for effect you don't need to hear the words that are being said to know what's going on. I would say the only real flaw this film has is that Sera's pimp gets squeezed out of the picture in a pretty clunky way, and when he does you realize that outside of the obligatory battering about he gives her, the two characters have nothing in common. In fact even though Sera is, underneath it all, a vulnerable character, the amount of strength she has would really warrant her being a call girl rather than a hooker. But I'm nit-picking. For all you aspiring filmmakers out there, take a look at this film as a demonstration of how you can make a masterpiece with not much more than two incredible actors. Shot in Super 16mm (one quarter the cost of a 35mm film), the graininess of the image is able to evoke the bittersweet seediness of the situation and the locale, so when you do see the love that these characters share it is that much more tangible and real.",Leaving Las Vegas
191,k_28,A tragedy which will make you feel better!,8,19 November 2014,"Its rare to come across a tragedy which in the end still leaves you something absolutely positive and make you believe in life...that there maybe just maybe true love that exists in this world! Its a story of despair and hopelessness and pain...But its also story of hope , of love and of those beautiful moments which adds meaning to life. Its only when you see death hovering around you ; you end up discovering Life Is Beautiful. Its a paradox and hence a tragedy but beyond that its a pure love. A love so pure that both people say that they want other person for their selfish reasons ; to get over their own loneliness & emptiness and still they manage to make each other truly happy.Its hard not to be touched by this movie and not have a tear in your eyes. At many moments you stare at the characters on the screen and may see even your own vivid reflection. You can feel for Nicolas Cage because he is good soul who is tired of his life...who nobody really understood or cared for when he needed them most. Someone who has been left to die alone in vast desert. And he conceded to his fate and embracing his death with open arms that he meet someone where two people love each other as they always should have. Without any conditions , without any expectations , without any social or peer pressure ; without wearing any masks on their faces. Bare , honest and tranquil love . Where two people feel other person can feel his pain without speaking ; where two people can cry with each other without being judged and where they can feel each other beyond the skin ..deep underneath the heart...right at their soul.If anyone ever doubted the existence of soul ; i wish they tell us how else can they describe the two characters in this movie. They nothing but two broken souls who become soulmates to heal each other !!",Leaving Las Vegas

I finally sat down and gave it a watch and was not disappointed. Nic Cage and Elisabeth Shue are great. Watching their relationship blossom in the middle of Cage's plan to drink himself to death is both beautiful and heart breaking at the same time. Seeing the struggle for both of the characters to respect Cage's own wish while also seeing the beauty in Shue is a complex and sad character study. With the added layer of the backstory and tragic loss of the writer, there is an added layer of sorrow in the film. Watching the film through the lens of it being John O'Brien's suicide note of sorts grounds the work in real human struggle and despair.It's a must watch for Cage fans as well as anybody looking for a beautiful and dark love story. 8/10.",Leaving Las Vegas

They both are wonderful and, it's a dream, but they deserved to won the Oscars (Only Cage Won). The movie is beautiful because tell us the love story, a really dark love story, of Ben and Sera. I will never forget this names, Ben and Sera. and Yuri... what a bad character! I hated this character, it's the villain of the movie. That's the only I disliked of the movie.

194,robertdelpopolo,Interesting take on a classic love story,6,5 November 2018,"An alcoholic and a prostitute fall in love. Not your usual love story.The acting is well done, both players being believable and quite accurate to their characters. The alcoholism was really on point, almost eerily. Watching all the stages of it at times was quite horrific actually. The bar fight is realistic in the sense that a drunk will oftentimes be manipulated into a fight that he didnt deserve as portrayed in the movie. Watching the withdrawl symptoms left a bad taste in my mouth.Really enjoyed the interlaced counselling sessions, as they made Sera's character more believable and helped sympathise with. Also neither of their backstories is explained in too much detail which is quite a relief considering how its a drag most of the time in other movies. Just flashbacks and a bit of exposition are enough to send a message.Unfortunately the story is however quite predictable and it actually tells you quarter of a way through how it will end, as Dan has been steadily drinking in every shot and therefore his time is limited.Enjoyable ride, interesting characters yet lacks any depth.",Leaving Las Vegas
195,burbank904416010,An uncompromising love story,10,2 September 2001,"Forget Pretty Woman or Sleepless In Seattle, this is a film about real love. Two people, who have habits which are going to destroy them accept each other for who they are, knowing that their time together may be very short. Ben is an alcoholic and Sera is a prostitute. From the moment when Ben asks Sera if he can pay money just to talk, they fall in love. They carry on with their painful lives, made better only with the relationship they share together. This is a downbeat, brutal film which isn't an easy watch. Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue are both excellent in the main two roles, instantly inducing our sympathy and making us hope for a happy ending. Overall, this is one of the most powerful and touching romances we've seen in the past decade.

He'd start kissing other women in front of me and new years eve he disappeared for two days on a binder, called me two days later stranded somewhere. I was pretty screwed up to subject myself to that. That's the two kind of people you have here. If you can relate then you'll let out a big sigh at the end because there are some intense scenes.

She is an incredible actress and I find her beauty just captivating. With the said, the story is unbelievable and Nick Cage was just ok (no idea how he got an Oscar for this one). I'm not anti Nick (I like many of his movies like ConAir and the Rock) I just thought that playing a drunk was not that hard, though he wasn't bad at all. And what was with the Russian guys in the beginning, that plot element went nowhere. Oh, did I mention how much I like Elisabeth.

198,please_stand_by,Love in the Midst of Terminal Despair,8,28 February 2017,"I'll start by saying this isn't a pleasant film to watch; however, it's a powerful one. It is executed methodically, through an unapologetic, uncompromising lens, examining the self-destructiveness of human beings in agonizing circumstances, with the caveat that even in utter anguish you can find some degree of comfort through the mutual support of another.The main character, played by Nicolas Cage, has given up on life. He is deeply dependent on alcohol to numb the pain of a life-altering tragedy involving his past family, though the details remain unspecified. He meets Sera, a disillusioned prostitute, after giving up and moving to Las Vegas to die. They quickly become reliant on one another for support in their otherwise profoundly lonely, profoundly miserable lives. But it quickly becomes established that their paths are set; they will not change.The film's greatest strength comes from the uncompromising nature of its exploration of difficult themes such as caring for someone in the face of unending despair and inevitable death. The story itself is fairly minimalist, making its thought-provoking points brilliantly without diluting them with anything artificial or sappy. The whole thing feels honest and genuine in its execution. The way the characters are portrayed by the two lead actors is also excellent, particularly Elizabeth Shue. Nicolas Cage's performance rides the line of overacting in a few places, but it works given the extremeness of the character.At a few points, the film does feel like it meanders from its strengths. This is most notable in a few scenes when the main characters are not together. Whenever they are together, the film shines. I also found some of the music for the film (which was, in part, composed by the director) to be distracting or out of place, particularly in the first half. The film is also so raw in its depictions of human despair and misery that it is a hard one to really derive true enjoyment from. It's not a film I anticipate wanting to watch again any time soon.Even while much of the film is unpleasant and difficult to digest, it is nonetheless a very strong, well-made film with a conclusion of a subtly uplifting nature. One person can make a difference in another person's life, even if it is at the very end.",Leaving Las Vegas

Isn't it a horrible feeling when you realize a movie you had originally thought to be brilliant just doesn't cut the mustard in subsequent viewings? Granted, the performances by Elizabeth Shue and Nicolas Cage are outstanding, but there's something cold and exploitative about ""Leaving Las Vegas"" that I can't quite put my finger on.  Two hours of watching someone sink into his own personal hell just doesn't cut it for me anymore.  The characters were just so self indulgent, especially Ben.  I'm not saying that ""Leaving Las Vegas"" isn't worth seeing, or that there isn't a good deal to recommend about it, but it's just such a downer.  ""Days of Wine and Roses"" and ""Drunks"" deal with alcoholism in a much more three dimensional manner than this melodrama.",Leaving Las Vegas
201,mywakinglife01,One of the most horrifying dramas I've seen.,10,7 December 2020,I've been curious to watch this movie since I knew Nic Cage won an Oscar for it. I'd put it up there with the same way I feel about Requiem For A Dream. Great movie but will never watch it again. It was sad and intense and melancholy. If you are a heavy drinker it will scare the hell out of you to picture this as your future. It's the kind of movie that sticks with you.

202,rah25,Unconvincing melodrama,4,22 November 2003,"Nicolas Cage stars as Ben Sanderson, a heavy drinker.  After losing his job, Ben travels to Las Vegas, where he plans drink himself to death.  There he meets Sera (Elizabeth Shue), a prostitute, and forms an unlikely (and uncomfortable) relationship with her.Despite how the critics have praised this film, there remains many problems with it.  For instance, with the exaggerated amount of alcohol Sanderson consumes, it is hard to believe that he would remain conscious throughout most of the film.  Shue, seems to be somewhat miscast as Sera.  Although she gives a decent performance, she appears to be too beautiful for this kind of role.  At the same time, the audience is not given enough of an explanation for why Ben has decided to become an alcoholic.  As a result, it is hard to sympathize with Ben and his drinking, we don't really know why he is doing it.  This is also true for Shue's character.  The audience is not given enough information about her past to understand why she has chosen such a profession.  Also, the love story between Ben and Sera seems somewhat unbelievable.  Given how men have treated Sera in the past, why would she trust and fall in love so easily with Cage's alcoholic character.As a result, Leaving Las Vegas stands as a flawed and standard tear-jerker whose plot consistently lacks logic.

203,dom-taylor,Powerful (Spoilers),7,16 June 2004,"There is no doubt Nicholas Cage, and actress Elisabeth Shue gave an excellent performance in this deep, and powerful picture. The movie as a whole is extremley harrowing and shocking, and will definitely leave the viewer thinking after the end. The general thread is about a heavy alcoholic (Cage), ruining his tiersome life with excessive amounts of drink, added to it constant disrespect and depression. Living with him is hooker Sera (Shue),his girlfriend, where together, their relationship is deeply pushed by the pressures of the consequences of alcohol, prostitution, and disrespect from outsiders. By no doubt an extremley powerful, and emotionally charged story riveting through the characters; and will probably be regarded as some as a small time master piece for alcoholics to look back on.Superb!!",Leaving Las Vegas

205,megomez,Outstanding film! ---- In my personal top ten.,10,26 December 2003,"I haven't seen this movie for years, but just looked it up here and felt the need to give it the praise it so deserves.  This film is a masterpiece in my heart, period.  I knew when I saw it that I had just had the privilege of witnessing a most beautiful work.  For me, it was one of those experiences that changes the way you see the world and yourself.  As others have stated here, the main performances here by Elizabeth Shue and Nicolas Cage are extraordinary.  Both. Cage received an Oscar....but to my great dismay, Elizabeth Shue did not and was basically unrecognized.  That p***ed me off. :) Actually, I believe that as her character in the movie itself, she was the ""angel"" of the film in the sense that her heart lit this film in a real way.  Why this movie was basically looked over and is not recognized more is beyond me.  Well I guess when a movie like Titanic (souped up and struggling with superficiality with the exception of Leo DiCaprio-saved the girl and the film) is the big winner, it's not surprised that a rare jewel like Leaving Las Vegas is more or less ignored. I'm not going to tell you what it's about, that's not really possible, it's an experience you need to see and have for yourself.  My wishes for you....that the heart of this movie give water to you on your journey as Sera ""gave water"" to Ben.  My opinion: 10/10  (Means extraordinary, masterpiece----rare)",Leaving Las Vegas
206,Yuto_Zeiram,"Jack Daniels, Semen & a touch of Vegas blues.",8,24 April 2006,"Francis Ford Coppola's ""One from the Heart"" already taught us what kind of a lonely and melancholic place Vegas can be. Mike Figgis adds this up with his wonderful movie ""Leaving Las Vegas"". Vegas is the pit of ""blues"", and it is here where two lonely souls find each other, and decide to make the best of it.One of them is Ben (Nicholas Cage), a middle aged screenwriter, who is addicted to alcohol. He lost his inspiration, his job, his family, and because of that the will to live on. So he decides to burn his work and house (Nick Cage is litterly burning bridges), pack everything he has, and spend a fortune on booze only to drive to Vegas and drown himself in alcohol with the objective of killing himself. The other one is the woman Sera (Elizabeth Shue), who is working the streets as a prostitute, and is being abused by her paranoid pimp Yuri (Julian Sands). One night Ben almost runs Sera over with his car, but he can just stop in front of her and she walks up to his car and shows her middle finger as she walks away. Ben seems to be fascinated by her in some way. Letting himself slide in his final days, Ben has decided to spend his money, on booze, hookers and gambling, and in the following night he meets Sera again, and asks her to ""fuck"" him. As she agrees to go with him to his motel room, what happens after I will not tell, only that they develop a relationship, which goes deeper.It is the ""two lonely souls finding each other drama"" which isn't new. But the circumstances ARE new. The whole approach to the movie is new and Figgis knows what he wants to show us. The way he directed his shots, he takes the audience away in an almost dream like sequence only to let us awake at the end of this insane story. An alcoholic and a hooker, who end up together voluntary in a romantic relationship. Sounds crazy om paper. But Figgis and O'Brian make it believable. No dead Hollywood sentiment. No, Figgis just gives you the plain things you need, without ever preaching about either Sera's or Ben''s lifestyle, which is pleasant.The performance by Cage is well,... it's very Cage (You know). This probably the only time that I buy into his quircks and overacting. It's silly, it's tragic, but it works. Shue is marvelous. Cage convinced me in his role of suicidal alcoholic, and Shue also does a good job at being a melancholic hooker who is behind her mask of the job a really nice girl, but also very lonely.Finally what makes this film is Figgis's eye, and the score which is drenched in blues. He actually pulled Sting out of a closet who sings a couple of songs, which are very moving, and the music fits very well with the image. Let yourself drown in sorrow a couple of hours long, and when you get out it you feel so good. Although I loved it, not everyone will find it good, and maybe you will hate it but it clearly is a must have seen... If only to convince you that at a certain time Nick Cage actually was a good actor.",Leaving Las Vegas
207,oldguybc,Development of character,10,12 January 2005,"O'Brien's character development is really thought- provoking. I was really saddened to hear of his demise. It takes a special kind of writer that can take the time to develop such complex character traits that he laid down for this tragic tale.In this movie Cage's character falls into the almost unheard- of category of someone who has convinced himself that his life is over and selects suicide by alcoholic consumption. I know a lot of drunks but none that I can honestly say ever really could be defined as trying to drink themselves to death although quite often their friends and family would tell them this if only to try to shock them into sobriety. Usually they were just a ""party person that somehow lost control"". Just before they realize they are at death's door they say ""help me!"" or some inane thing like that but it's too late by then.Cage's character's burning of his possessions, among them pics of his family(?), his feeble bleat of ""I'm sorry"" to his boss upon being fired, his almost apologetic proposition of Shue's character, all of these defined someone looking desperately for pity but really defined a person who could care less about whatever the future held for him as long as it didn't allow him to suffer too much.Shue's character, on the other hand, is the classic co- dependent sufferer. She personifies a kind- of long term Stockholm syndrome by accepting all this abuse from her pimp in nearly unconditional submission and then blaming herself for his eventual destruction that she really had quite a bit to do with but absolutely no control over. These flaws are not all that uncommon. Society would like you to believe they are uncommon but our overcrowded prisons and, unfortunately, sometimes morgues belie that assumption. In real life there is usually an underlying belief or condition that justifies this situation in the mind of the principle, and sometimes these beliefs and conditions are just about as weird as you can get but usually the principles have no trouble accepting them. The usual exception is that, in the movies these people are all beautiful, as they are in this one, but in real life they all look like they belong on the Jerry Springer show, or perhaps Jerry Springer rejects which is just about unimaginable. Am I making sense? Anyhow, the characters in this movie react to each other in situations so unlike what 99.9% of us ever experience that it fascinates us, that is why we watch these movies. We tell ourselves: ""So this is what some people's lives are like? Wow, this is fantastic but it could never be me!"" And then we watch the film credits and turn off the TV and go off to bed. Sometimes we have nightmares. I didn't. Didn't even consider it. Just too far- fetched to ever relate to my life. Thank god!",Leaving Las Vegas

No one really believes he'll do it, but he's determined no matter what.This movie is not for everyone and is very disturbing. If you are in the mood for a powerful, yet depressing movie with large helpings of sex, violence & alcohol abuse, then this is the movie for you.

This movie has it all. No wonder Nicolas Cage won an Oscar for this movie, because this really is a masterpiece of acting. Elisabeth Shue was 'only' nominated, but in my eyes she should have won one too.

I would think this would really cut into concession sales, a big part of theater revenue. ---There is a survival factor to group nausea, I understand. If one person in a family group vomits, the others feel like it because this extends the first person's sensitivity to the food they all probably just ate.--- All I know is that it turns me off. Yuk.:-(..... 2) Why does Ben try to kill himself by slowly drinking? Heck, one good binge where he raises his blood alcohol level above a certain point and it would be curtains, and a very short movie, I guess..... 3) I think that Ben and Sera's love should have helped each other to overcome their respective problems.

A beautiful tale of two proud and graceful people who have been caught up in a rut of fate. An exquisite movie and something that make you feel better after watching it.However, there are certain drastic directorial and camera work issues: the camera often fails to focus on the subject in question. The booze glasses keep emptying or filling themselves up throughout the movie.

All so very self-abusive and sadly the performances did not pull me in. In general, I like Nic Cage and Elizabeth Shue. Mike Figgis has definetly since developed a great sense of filmmaking. This film, however, I simply found to be far too incredibly Hollywood-Formulaic (at its time of release) and predictable.

Come May2006, I watched it again with little memory from the previous viewing and after 5 mins I was hooked- basically to enjoy this film and really get the most out of it-you have to get into the head of nic cage a guy who has lost the two things that mean the most to him his kid and his woman. he's obviously lost control of his life and after alienating himself from friends (we have all done it) he then loses his job it is at this point he decides to drink himself to death. the next 1hour and 40 mins are often distubing as you should find yourself pulling for him to get better- but by the end its not your typical Hollywood ending-lets leave it at that. in all essence this film needs concentration, yes it is depressing and yes it can sometimes move slowly but you really need to appreciate where Nic cage is coming from to enjoy this flick. Tjhat does not mean you need to have experienced drink or drug problems but you need to think of a sad time in your life where you have lost something/someone! and how that made you feel. now i now thats a bit heavy for watching a film but y'know what! thats what makes this interesting and original- it pulls your heart out and takes you for a ride! seriously this is a great film in every aspect and even the music fits well with it.

220,endem-1,"Horror and beauty, often in the same scene",10,10 December 2006,"""Leaving Las Vegas"" could be called a study in dichotomy. Both in theme and execution we see horror and beauty, often in the same scene. While seeking companionship with terminally alcoholic Ben (a horrible waste of a man) we observe a haloed Sera (whose profession causes degrading situations) tenderly caring for him. We see a motel proprietress with an almost friendly smile as she evicts Ben and Sera after a drunken mishap. A kindly cab driver (nicely played by Lou Rawles) comforts a broken spirited Sera. And so on.The director's use of light, color and composition are amongst the best I've seen, ever. This is a film that can be appreciated for it's visuals alone, but that would be a terrible waste because the sound track (performed by Sting) is superb. Yes the ""whore with a heart of gold"" is a hackneyed characterization and Ben in the opening scenes seems a little too gleeful in constructing his demise but these are minor quibbles.

It is anything but a traditional story, but I think that it does a much better job of capturing the characters true emotions, than almost any romantic movie out there today. Both Shue and Cage come from different walks of life, and each have their own emotional problems. This makes it entertaining as a couple because they are essentially dysfunctional, but still manage to maintain a relationship. The performance by Cage is awesome, and Shue does a great job as well. Overall this movie is a rather dark love story with great acting and a good plot. My only complaints over the movie is that there are few minor characters and throughout the movie the volume is low and some dialog is hard to hear, also in many scenes the camera angle makes it hard to see what exactly is happening.",Leaving Las Vegas

230,damien_27,Beautiful Filmaking,10,21 November 2007,"""Leaving Las Vegas"" is the sort of film that places the viewer in the depth of sadness the characters feel. The film stars Nicholas Cage as a burn out named Ben who decides that he will drink himself to death. Using his severance pay he travels to Las Vegas to complete his plan. Along his journey he meets Sera, a beautiful prostitute who is touched by Ben's sadness. Sera almost instantly falls for Ben and decides to take him in despite the fact that she will soon lose him. The plot of this movie is not so important as the relationship between Ben and Sera. The two don't have in depth conversations about life, aside from Ben telling Sera that she can never ask him to stop drinking, yet the connection they share is genuine. The story does little to demonstrate any logical reason Ben and Sera should be together, but the strength of the acting ties everything together. While Nicolas Cage won the 1995 best actor Oscar, Elizabeth Shue was ignored in the best performance of her career. Time will show that she was deserving over Susan Sarandon's performance in ""Dead Man Walking"". ""Leaving Las Vegas"" presents one of the great and tragic movie romances.

And if you are one of those persons who loves life unconditionally, then you are doomed to hate it.But after watching this movie I strongly believe that depression has never been so convincing, and I don't think any film dared to travel so far through the dark side of humankind as this one did. At least, not in this way.Figgis managed to capture the alienated atmosphere and the obscure emotional environment that characterizes the true essence of self-destruction, and even better, he has successfully establish a definite purpose to its motives, whether we choose to call it redemption or salvation or simply oblivion.But there's a lot more to it. The center of Leaving Las Vegas, its definitive and ultimate core, is not the screaming and striking desperation that first emerges out of it. Actually, all that intense, vehement and almost impassioned darkness is just the preliminary act, the introductory preparation, the setting of a dense psychological scenario built in anticipation for the real story that is about to unfold before our eyes: one of true love between a man and a woman, in its most extraordinary form - the spiritual and affective one.Leaving Las Vegas is about the rising of that kind of love above the brutal indifference and coldness of the outer world.

She portrays her character with believable emotion and it's easy to forget that she's an actress. In my humble opinion, one of the best ways to measure an actor's performance is if you forget that they're not really the character. There are also some very good actors playing bit roles: Xander Berkeley as a cab driver, R. Lee Ermey as a man attending a convention, and Laurie Metcalf as a landlady. The ending may surprise you but it's the perfect ending for this movie. A word of warning about the Blu Ray: the transfer is horrible.

238,crf98093,"Wow, this is one of the best portrayals of late-stage alcoholism yet.",9,8 January 2005,"I've seen many films about alcoholism / drug addiction where the lead character starts off as a normal everyday person-who...starts experimenting...goes overboard...then gets clean. Figgis' and O'Brien's ""Leaving Las Vegas"" was far more realistic, as well as heartbreaking (Just as alcoholism truly is).The film never explains how Ben Sanderson (Cage) became this type of alcoholic, or how his life was prior to the opening sequence. It just showed a late-stage hopeless alcoholic, such as I once was and certain members of my family still are, and his self-destruction and despair.One of the most heartfelt scenes was when Ben was unable to sign his name due to experiencing DT's (Delirium Tremens), then he left, had a few drinks, came back, and was outgoing and complete as can be. This is actually how chronic alcoholism becomes.The whole story of him going to Las Vegas to drink himself to death is very depressing and heartbreaking. In fact, the writer of the novel which this movie is based on took his own life and was also an apparent alcoholic.Nicolas Cage was excellent as Ben, so was Elisabeth Shue as Sera. Two people who accepted and surrendered to their lifestyle.My first time watching this, I thought it would have been a better ending if Ben sobered up, Sera quit hooking and they fell in love and lived happily ever after. But watching it again I changed my mind, I think the ending was appropriate to heighten the emotional climax. Because not all alcoholics/addicts do make it, most of them do in fact, suffer until their own fate.9/10",Leaving Las Vegas
239,adrian_rawling,Incredibly tragic and moving story,10,27 October 2021,"This movie is unlike any other I have seen in the way that it is utterly bleak from start to finish; the viewer knows this from the very outset - it is quite apparent that there will be no fairytale, happy ending. Yet this grim and irreversible downward trajectory Ben (Nicholas Cage) is on doesn't detract from the power of the screenplay whatsoever. This is truly unique.Every single second of this film is believable, authentic and drenched in realism. The characters and dialogue are so well written; the chemistry between Cage and Shue is staggering, who both give career best performances. There are moments of genuine emotion and insight that, in all honesty, I can't recall experiencing before when viewing a film.The soundtrack to the film, with the haunting voice of Sting offset by the more uplifting tones of Michael McDonald, matches the atmosphere of the drama beautifully.Having suffered from depression, hopelessness and addiction during my life, I found Ben's character to be extremely relatable. Whilst I deeply wanted his relationship with Sera to reverse his desire to end his life, I concurrently admired his perseverance to realise his tragic plan.It is a profoundly heavy-hearted portrayal of life - Cage characterises chronic depression and anhedonia so convincingly. It's painful at times to watch him self-destruct, all while Sera is falling in love with him. But Ben is, sadly, beyond the point of being able to love Sera back. He is consumed by alcoholism and is no longer emotionally present.Her existence is equally tragic. I was moved to tears when she is beaten and raped by those young thugs, just after Ben's betrayal. The way she accepts Ben's plan and, reluctantly, supports his decision is precisely what he needed from her. They have a meeting of minds and connect so organically that it is immensely touching to watch. This is of course emphasised by the wonderful acting.Alcoholism, or any addiction for that matter, is a horrible business and this film portrays that evil with brutal realism. Ben commits to killing himself with such conviction that it leaves the viewer wondering what on earth caused his dreadful state of mind. He says to a prostitute that ""I'm not sure if I started drinking when my wife left me, or if she left me because of my drinking"", suggesting that the end of his marriage was actually self-inflicted.Substance abuse is the effect. Depression / mental illness and an addictive personality are the cause. Alcohol remedied his emotional pain, which led him down a path of overindulgence as a result of his loss of self-control and physical dependence. Once he had travelled too far down that road, he reached a point of no return and the irreversible state of mind we find on our screens.His own death was his objective. Sera helped him fulfil that objective. As sad as that is, there is some solace to be found in the conclusion as it brought an end to his pain and suffering. In usual circumstances, the finale would be heartbreakingly sad. But in Leaving Las Vegas, it is perfectly fitting.",Leaving Las Vegas

245,chiefaircontrollersup,Stretches The Imagination,7,21 July 2021,"The story would have been far more believable, especially since we know from jump street that he intends to drink himself to death, if they portrayed his drinking as even humanly possible. I have been an alcoholic and I guarantee you that no one can gulp down quart after quart and stay upright. Any human on earth is susceptible to the same chemistry of alcohol metabolism per human weight versus amount consumed and % of alcohol. In simple terms, no one could consume that much alcohol without dying of alcoholic poisoning in the first 48 hours. Suicide notwithstanding, drinking, no guzzling bottle after bottle and maintaining enough sobriety to run around Veges was just too hard for me to accept, as a former Retired Chief Petty Officer & Navy alcoholic for almost 21 years. I have been drunk and partied in 35-40 countries around the world. I have never seen alcoholics that could guzzle bottle after bottle of whiskey, vodka or gin the way they show Cage's character. Cage's ""over the top"" portrayal reminded me of John Belushi guzzling that bottle of Black Jack Daniels in ""Animal House."" Even there, we all know the reasonable limits for drugs & alcohol as evidenced by John Belushi and a hundred other rising stars of entertainment fame who overdosed and died alone, sometimes in a seedy hotel room. All in all, the movie and performance by Cage seems to strive to be noir, but for me, the alcohol excesses stretched my ability to stay focused. Even Vegas throws out people who look like they have had one drink too many. Hell, I've been thrown out of bars in Vegas back in the 70's or 80's at the height of my drunken bar-hopping days, the Palomino Club was where I started the party every time. Anyway, I liked the love story angle of this movie and the tragedy of broken souls finding each other but please keep the limits of believability to a reasonable consumption of mixed alcohol that alcoholics can relate to. For instance, every year a college kid dies from alcohol poisoning by chugging a fifth or a quart of whiskey.

246,Crazy_Shapiro,The feel-good review of the year! :-),1,9 July 2002,"--Spoilers!  As if this movie could be any more ""spoiled!""--Herein, Figgis equates all non-coital intercourse with rape. Not surprising, given that in ""Your Friends and Neighbors,"" he equates all homosexual relations... with rape! How else could he follow-up ""In the Company of Men"" -- in which he equates most HETEROsexual relations with rape?! Given that evident body of work, Figgis' irrational hatred of his own sex is likely attributable to one thing: He, himself, was raped.So forgive me when I don't heed a prostitute's preaching about what I do (or do not) in the privacy of my own bedroom. It's just too bad that an entire generation of potential lovers have been negatively biased by the moralizing of a fictional character -- one who routinely gives up rights to her body via selling sexual favors!Any/all involved with with this production should be ashamed.

249,darren_colledge,A sobering portrayal of loneliness and hopeless addiction.,9,2 April 2019,"This picture hits your soul like a gut punch. If you have come for an easy watch, choose another movie. Leaving Las Vegas is a visceral journey into the depths of despair.
Nicolas Cage's portrayal of Ben Sanderson, an alcoholic screenwriter, is arguably his finest hour. The movie starts as Ben, who has lost his wife and child, struggles to combine the complexities of holding down a career whilst consuming industrial amounts of alcohol on a daily basis. As is common with addictions, the proverbial 'devil on one shoulder' won the day and Ben is reluctantly fired from his job. With his loneliness now all consuming and with nothing else left to cling on to, Ben resolves to take the money he has left and move to the bright lights and seedy underbelly of Las Vegas, where he intends to drink himself to death.
Ben arrives in Vegas and immediately hires a motel room, paying several weeks up front so as not to be disturbed during one of his inevitable stupors. After loading up on liquor, a foray onto the strip leads to a chance encounter with a prostitute called Sera, immaculately played by Elisabeth Shue. Craving companionship on his ruinous quest, Ben proceeds to elicit Sera's services for the night and they head off for a night of drink but, surprisingly to Sera, no debauchery. They immediately forge a bond based on a night spent talking about their lives. Sera, in particular, forms a strong attachment to Ben.Nicolas Cage won an Oscar for this role and it is not hard to see why. Every mannerism, tic and nuance was on the money. The pain in his voice and the desperation etched on his face were a testament to the dedication and the time that he invested in bringing this character to life. This is an intensely sad film but still manages, at times, to show redemption in its characters. A love story borne out of despair, a chemistry between two people who need each other in different ways, Leaving Las Vegas is the antithesis to a Hollywood rom-com but still in its own way displays a mental connection between the two main protagonists that briefly warms the heart. Like a flickering light in the wind, though, this will distinguish as quickly as it sparks.Leaving Las Vegas is compelling, gritty and raw. Accompanied by a fantastic jazz score, you will be thinking about this movie long after the credits roll.",Leaving Las Vegas
250,Airreilly,Hmmmm...,10,30 November 2004,"This is a very important film. The writer of the piece killed himself shortly afterwards, so I suppose this would be considered something of a swan-song. Cage's performance is a wonder, deserving an award, Shue does her best to capture the role also. I think anyone who doesn't understand alcohol problems should watch this, it manages to display a certain humanity when conveying such a selfish act. It's scary to see such an accurate depiction of a human without strength, hope plentiful in his 'girlfriend' despite the circumstance. It mirrors real life, the lack of ability when trying to tame adversity, the music (contrary to the opinion of other users) is apt, haunting and appropriate. It might appear to be lazy, yet the its hazy co-ordination lends a theme to the movie. You should watch this film and let it open your eyes.",Leaving Las Vegas

But, I think that this is one of those movies that isn't really a story- its focused more on reality, in this case, the reality of how the lives of alcoholics and prostitutes are very hard to cope with and are extremely draining.Through out my viewing, all I kept thinking was that this would not be a good movie to watch with friends- its not fun to watch, really (but its still good). Its also not very good to watch with your family, because many parts are disturbing, graphic and dejecting.Nicolas Cage is hard to read- most of the time you don't know if he's a great actor, or just crazy as hell. He acts mostly the same old crazy guy in this movie as any other, so his performance is very difficult to judge. If I had to choose, I'd say that it was good. He was over the top, but that's what the role required. Also, he acted greatly in some very meaningful parts.The movie would be so much better, if it weren't for that darn music and soundtrack! None of it fits in well with the scenes/atmosphere, and all in all, even if it did, its still crappy music and songs. Such a pity- a good movie needs good music, and the music really brought the quality of this movie down.Would I watch it again? Maybe in 2/3 years time- if I'm in a sad mood.

They make there bargain: SHe won't ask him to stop his liquid suicide and he won't interfere with his work.The story is based on the semi-autobiography of John O'Brien who shot himself 2 weeks after he sold away the rights. For such a cheap budget, this film is well handled by Mike Figgis and has strong performances from both Nicolas Cage and Elizabeth Shue. The one scene that really stuck to my mind was Ben tooling his way down a Las Vegas Liquor store filling his trolley with various brands of liquor. This scene shows how frank Ben is: He's decided to drink himself to death.Overall this movie has strong performances and I would call it one of the greatest love stories of all time ***9/10***",Leaving Las Vegas
254,nybackus,The most misogynistic film in recent memory,1,19 December 1999,"That Nicholas Cage received an academy award for this dreadful film is incredible. Any actor worth his salt (and Cage certainly is) can turn in a performance as an alcoholic without breaking into a sweat. Yet these roles always seems to appeal to academy voters for some strange reason when really difficult and challenging performances get passed up. (Not to mention brilliant comic performances.) The film is a dreary male fantasy: you're suicidal, drinking yourself to death, and a gorgeous (make that, drop-dead, gorgeous) hooker falls hopelessly in love with you despite the self-loathing and the vomit and makes it her goal in life to get you to orgasm. Yeah, right!",Leaving Las Vegas
255,davekelly,A stylishly filmed tragedy even Shakespeare would be proud to have composed,10,6 January 2000,"In Leaving Las Vegas Mike Figgis composed a tragedy even Shakespeare would be proud of. Nic Cage, who deservedly won an Oscar for his performance and Elizabeth Shue  give a new meaning to the phrase ""hopeless romantics"" as two lonely troubled people caught in a downward spiral of self loathing who fall in love in the most unlikely circumstances, Cage plays Ben who has driven to Las Vegas, having lost his job and his wife, to drink himself to death. Here he meets Shue's Sera, a bullied prostitute who takes Ben into her home. Whether through love or just the desire to be needed they embark on a relationship on the condition that he can not ask her to give up prostitution and in turn she can not ask him to stop drinking. Indeed a modern classic the film was based on the semi-autobiographical novel by John O'Brien, which in what was many ways a suicide note for the young author who committed suicide as soon as he had sold the rights to the film.",Leaving Las Vegas

After hearing so much about, waiting years to see it, I may have been expecting too much.  I thought it could have been a lot better.  It seemed aimless, which I'm sure is the whole point.  The one thing I did really like about it is that it's very realistic.  We never find out what happened to Cage's wife and son, because we are just bystanders to this story.  That is the way this movie should be, because it is about the end of a journey - no re-telling is necessary.  We know terrible things have happened, and have to trust the judgment of Cage.  For example, the part when he's gambling and knocks over the blackjack table.  He starts screaming, ""I am his father"" repeatedly. There is no explanation for this.  As bystanders in real-life, there are lots of things that we do not get explanations for.  I believe that is the redeeming quality of this movie.",Leaving Las Vegas
257,capreeni,I'll Drink To This,9,1 August 2000,"Leaving Las Vegas is a sobering and somewhat sombre movie about a man who heads to Las Vegas with the intention of drinking himself to death. Nicholas Cage, whom I am usually not a very big fan of, plays the lead role marvelously well and Elisabeth Shue also puts in a good performance as the prostitute he befriends.Mike Figgis manages to capture the dazed-like state of Cage's character and the viewer really gets a taste of Ben Sanderson's hopelessness and despair. Be warned that the film contains some rather sexually explicit scenes and dialogue. There is nothing cheery or joyful about this movie and it is more likely to leave you feeling drained than it is refreshed. You will probably either love or hate this film after seeing it. I would  have to say that I fall into the second category.9/10.",Leaving Las Vegas
258,neilajarn,Acting Tour de force,7,3 June 2006,"Cage's mesmerising and visceral depiction of one man's total disintegration is an acting tour de force (aided and abetted by a poignant Elizabeth Shue performance), revealing the nihilism at the heart of alcoholism. Mike Figgis directs with his customary artistic flair, capturing the pathos of the central relationship without resorting to any sentimental grandstanding; his sensitive restraint allows the audience - not supplied with any substantial character back story - to judge the two lost souls purely through the prism of their doomed romance. Certain detractors have poured scorn on the film's insincerity (would a $500 a night hooker seek solace in an alcoholic hell-bent on drinking himself to death?), but that criticism is not wholly accurate: desperate people live a life devoid of the social mores that govern the rest of us - when they discover a kindred spirit, they are inexorably drawn to that person.",Leaving Las Vegas

Of course your entitled to your opinion about the film, but some of the comments made were a little irritating to say the least. For one I'm a recovering alcoholic, I know what it's like to go through all the struggles that come with it. I thought Nicholas Cage nailed it!! For some of these critics to mock and insult the performance that Cage gave really gets under my skin. Unless you have experienced the struggle of Alcoholism, then u have no room to critize how u think his performance should have gone. On another note, for the other critics calling this the worst movie ever made, or how unbearable or boring this movie was etc. etc. Here's a thought, collect your belongings, get up and leave the theater, or turn off your TV.

Admittedly, Cage's acting was stupendous - but if the movie was trying to send out a message, it failed miserably. It is never revealed what got him to his alcoholic state in the first place; like he says in one scene 'I don't remember if my wife left me coz I drink too much or I drink too much coz my wife left me'. The only solid point which was depressingly evident was how two people, due to their profession (one being a hooker) and personal habit (the other being an alcoholic), are treated as pariahs in the world and find solace in each other, despite not appreciating the choices made by the other. Full marks to Cage and Shue on how they portrayed their respective characters. However, lessons of compromise and compatibility can be put forward in better ways than this.",Leaving Las Vegas

He does everything, as long as he gets his six figure salary. Nevertheless, this is one of those movies in which you can see his true acting skills and dedication to perform. In Leaving Las Vegas, Ben Sanderson decides to drink himself to death after his wife left him and he pretty much loses everything else. Which means that most of the time, Nicolas has to play an excessive drinker. The astonishing thing about his performance is that he prepared for the role by filming himself while being heavily intoxicated and standing in front of a mirror. Later on, he would then re-watch the recording (sober) and imitate his own caught-on-tape behavior. So in the movie, he actually plays the drunk version of himself.",Leaving Las Vegas

I've always talked about Nicholas Cage as a good actor (I've seen most of his movies) saw him in two movies in which he had to play two roles in each one: in ""Face/off"", he did the bad guy, and the good guy; in ""Adaptation"" he played two twins with very different personalities...I act...and I know how difficult is to do that, so let's talk about Cage as an excellent actor... Well, I saw ""Leaving Las Vegas"" last week and it surprised me, actually, most of the scenes in the movie are disgusting, but in the good way, it's what they wanted to show, what they wanted to tell, what they wanted you to see...It's a really good film, with a nice soundtrack, that everybody have to see...",Leaving Las Vegas

However, their chemistry is believable. Figgis is a brilliant director and composer. I think this film is reflective of him somewhat. Anyway, breaks my heart everytime I watch it.",Leaving Las Vegas
266,aspinol03,Touched me in a way other movies fail to do,9,17 February 2005,"Leaving Las Vegas is one of those films that sends tingles down your spine, where when you walk out of the cinema you feel blown away, something which happens less and less these days.The two main characters were played excellently by Shue and Cage and could not have been played better by anyone else in my humble opinion. It is obvious that Figgis is from a musical background as the movie moves along like a Classical suite, albeit a rather bleak one but such a strong moving one and he acts more like a composer than a director playing on our emotions and sensibilities.How true this film is off the darker side of human nature, how those fallen souls just want to self destruct and the methods we use to do this. These characters are both lacking in self esteem but are also so lonely and that is what brings them together. Although not a love at first site situation the key factor in this short-lived relationship is that these two totally accept each other for what they really are, something we could do with more in our society. This is summed up by Cage's non-plus attitude towards Shue's work and by that fantastic scene where she buys him a Silver Hip Flask for his birthday.One of the truths this film hits home is how alcoholism or any other addiction totally takes over a persons life, one of the clinchers was when Cage said to Shue ""you can never ask me to give up drinking"", the fact that she stuck to this even though it must have hurt her inside meant there relationship continued.The rape scene was necessary yet horrific and I was in pieces after watching it, I like the way that it was spoilt bratty students who abused Shue and not some horrible old man as you would expect. These kids were far worse and the fact they treated her like a piece of meat so blatantly gave the scene that cringe factor, I really felt for Shue, no wonder she just wanted a guy who was straight and nice.The film score was so suited to the film and again illustrated Figgis's musical background; the use of freestyle jazz seemed to reflect the spiralling doom of Cage's character perfectly.So the lessons this film provides, well that no matter what a person is or what they do they all have souls, there is always someone else similar to us in life. If you pursue something admit it to yourself, stay off the booze and above all respect all people equally.",Leaving Las Vegas
267,papa_daddyo,leaving las vegas,10,25 July 2005,"What can one say about such a great movie? I struggle to grasp the most appropriate words for such a masterpiece of cinema. ""Leaving las Vegas"" is one of the few films one can see and truly fall in love with in their life. It is one of those films film critics can boast about and actually be correct in saying it is ""brilliant...dont miss it"". ""Leaving las Vegas"" is perfect in every single aspect. Finest acting - Cage earns the title of super-star actor in his meticulous performance of a terminal alcoholic. Shue is unprecedented in her role of downtrodden prostitute with a heart of gold, It is extremely disappointing she hasn't continued her acting as much or in as much distinguished roles. Beyond efficient directing by Figgis (also screen-writer) who's journey to super-stardom has arguably been a downward spiral from here. Figgis is one of the handful of directors who not only understands what he is writing but possesses the ability to convey it to others without being lost in translation. Some criticize his shaky, at times, claustrophobic filming but this merely compliments the story in an overall sense. I admire one such as he, who not only selects the films music but plays much of it himself. Another such great director is of course none other than the master Clint Eastwood. If its one thing this film didn't receive is the amount of recognition and acclaim it really deserved. Note only Cage received an academy award which he unequivocally deserved, but then so did Shue and Figgis. It really is the best film this narrator has seen in several decades. One can only hope that Figgis will retain such majesty and greatness in his story-telling and hopefully call back Cage and Shue for lead roles but no one can even consider repeating or even yet over-shadowing this film's beauty. For that would be impossible unto God himself.",Leaving Las Vegas

One day, people will regard him as one the better actors of his time period. Nicolas Cage actually won the Oscar for best actor against Richard Dreyfuss in ""Mr. Holland's Opus"", Anthony Hopkins in ""Nixon"", Sean Penn in ""Dead Man Walking"", Massimo Troisi in ""Il Postino.

It`s beautifully shot (but then that`s why i`d recommend almost anything by Mike Figgis!) and the dialogue is excellent. There`s some nice ideas such as the quasi-documentary sections sprinkled throughout the film. The one thing that really blew me away was that he had the balls to make *that* ending.

I've read a few reviews complaining that they don't understand what the characters (Ben and Sera) are thinking, or why they are in their respective situations.  These points are irrelevant. Stripped to its core, this movie is about complete love between two people, without judgment.  Why Ben is drinking and what happened to Sera as a child have nothing to do with that at all.  In my opinion, this is the best love story since ""Romeo and Juliet"", and is my favorite movie of all time. Every scene is shot perfectly, the cinematography, the dialogue, the music, it's all perfect.  Also, if you pay attention to colors in the film, blue, red, white, and black, they all have their own significance.  I'll leave it up to you to decide what they are, but they are definitely significant.

How can one make a film about someone deliberately drinking himself to death that is *not* depressing? What one can accuse this film of, is that it is not depressing enough, because Ben is looking and behaving far too good for a drunkard. In fact he's looking like a movie star who plays a drunkard. But I forgot that thanks to his performance.Besides that: is it the task of a work of art to teach or even to show moral principles, like some commentators claim? If you want this, read a theological book. It's actually the strongest point of the film that it lacks any explanation of Ben's motives and educational intentions.(And how can one possibly not be touched but bored by scenes like Sera staying with Ben until his death?

As an recovering alcoholic myself, let me set something straight:We don't drink for a ""reason"".  You don't *become* an alcoholic because your Mom dies or your wife leaves you, or because you have no friends.  People have drug addictions (yes, alcohol is a drug - just like heroin and crack - so if you use it you are classified as a drug-user) because they are born with a un-curable disease...otherwise they are known as drug-abusers.Ben was clearly an alcoholic in this film who drank because he needed to, just like myself and millions of others do.In many ways this film is just like Philadelphia...you are watching a man die of a terrible disease, and you get to see the effects that has on the people around him.Like American History X should be shown to EVERYONE to show the effects and reality of racism...this film should be shown to all to demonstrate the pain drugs bring to our world and that it is not all ""glamorous"".This film gets a 9/10...a landmark film.",Leaving Las Vegas

Ben is a functional alcoholic who after a divorce and losing his job goes down the pathway to non-functional alcoholic, he moves to Las Vegas. Sera is a hooker who he meets soon after arriving in Vegas and she manages to be the one stable element of his chaotic and quickly crumbling life.Cage's flawless performance is in my opinion the best of his filmography and drives the soul of this film. There are scenes where Cage's character is bedridden due to withdrawal, in these scenes you feel the pain with him, every twitch, every groan and when he reaches over to that two-six of vodka to ease the pain you feel disappointed but also can't help but feel relief.During the first third of the film I noticed a few different paths the plot could potentially go down. Because of this I made several assumptions on how the plot would turn out but the unique editing, cold-as-ice plot and stellar performances brought forth a story that is different from the Hollywood norm in the best possible ways.The one downside in my opinion is the soundtrack. It's filled with a bunch of cheesy R&B music which really lets you know that you're watching a film made decades ago.

So I had to synthesize something more useful, right? Well that probably won't crystallize exceptionally well, but here it is. After lurking for almost a decade and the boards being shut closed, this is the time and the movie I HAD to write my first review about.The movie is shot on 16mm film instead of 35mm for budget reason, but oh Lord, is there anything to suggest so. What a beautiful piece of cinema making. None of the pretentious bullshit, just brilliant art, angles and lens play.I dislike using clichés, but what a quintessential emotional roller coaster. People describe me as one that rarely shows emotion, so when a movie tears me up at least three times and throws me into bursts of laughter in between, I consider that a magnificent piece of art.Other reviewers go out to say the movie should not be looked at as an entertainment, given that it is a sad movie. And oh man, is it sad. But I beg to differ on the former. I never lost interest in it for a second. And by God, Nicholas Cage is a god of acting and I will be forever adamant about that.The way the movie toys with your emotions, the abrupt halt of the culmination pool scene, the way it was structured post that... just superb. I believe this film drove a large portion of alcohol abusers to sobriety. I really do. I feel it's that influential. It bears such great metaphors about the people who care about you, but your first and true love remains the bottle. The smallest of nitpicks I had was her unreasonable interest she developed for him, but sometimes you find somebody as broken as you and something magical entails.I was afraid to see the ending. And I was given good reasons to. And deep down I knew, but I was at peace with it.If by some miracle, somebody interested in the movie is reading this, I hope I am not ruining it for you and I gotta tell you this. It's a sad movie.

This is a good movie for teenagers to watch because it depicts the raw honesty of what excessive drinking does to you. I recommend this movie to all people my age (18 and around that), it will teach you a valuable lesson. Figgis is trying to put a point across with a movie this depressing and emotionally violent. Cage will also convince you with his superior acting ability, playing a raging alcoholic which is contrary to Cage's actual drinking habits.",Leaving Las Vegas
293,kleppercan,"painful but moving (mild spoiler, not a synopsis)",8,26 January 2009,"I see comments that come along with negative ratings (come on...a '1' for being misogynistic???) We don't quite know if Ben is drinking cos he got divorced or drinking caused the divorce but i have seen what drink can do to people and this film is very real. Cage and Shue both deliver excellent performances and do it in a very compassionate way. A hooker and a drunk wouldn't normally register as people that the everyday film goer would sympathise with, however we see in this film; raw human vulnerability. I don't think this film is sexist, especially not to the point of misogyny. Most of the male characters are not particularly positive ones and Shue is a strong woman with a tender, damaged nature. this film made me sad but I'm glad i got the chance to see it.",Leaving Las Vegas
294,Sashay_thru_the_sarcasm,"A 90's Masterpiece About Addiction, Fate & The Deepest/Darkest Corners of Love",10,13 April 2015,"Leaving Las Vegas has to be one of the darkest, most depressing movies to ever come out of Hollywood. It's: harrowing, heartbreaking, colorful, dark ::::very dark::::, over-the-top, intimate, gut wrenchingly sad & surprisingly funny at times, but by the end no ounce of hope is left.Based on a novel by the late John O' Brien: Leaving Las Vegas is about Ben Sanderson (Cage)- a suicidally depressed man who decides to drink himself to death after losing his family (possibly because of his drinking?) and later losing all his friends and job and personal possessions and chooses Las Vegas as his final resting place. While there, he meets a prostitute named Sera (Shue) and the two begin an oddly (and sadly) beautiful relationship.Mike Figgis, Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue take a somewhat far-fetched and risky (for Hollywood) scenario with cliché characters and create something that feels deeply and darkly real. After the first 15 minutes; which might also be the single best opening to a movie ever- we do not doubt Ben's intentions to drink himself to death. The amount of liquor he consumes throughout the film makes you part disgusted and part amused because of how relentlessly fast he's drinking it. And that is the brilliance of Cage's performance: he makes you laugh at his over-the-top antics and drinking then makes you ashamed for even laughing in the first place when you see his sickly condition and see him convulsing, shaking and dry heaving when he's gone too long without a drink or hallucinating when he's had too much. And what isn't there left to say about Elisabeth Shue's performance? She easily deserved an Oscar just as much as Cage, and you could even say that the believability of the story rested on her shoulders. Her few brief scenes with an unseen therapist are a fine, subtle highlight of the film and help you understand her character more and why she would fall for someone as far-gone as Ben. I have never seen any other Mike Figgis film but I think it's safe to say that this is his best work. The movie is filmed gorgeously and gorgeously scripted and there are a lot of great shots. He gets the best performances out of the actors (Even Julian Sands' pimp Yuri with his campy accent is surprisingly creepy), the music he composed, along with the memorable soundtrack, were perfect and added a light, romantic air to alleviate the suffocatingly somber tone......when needed- there are some brooding dramatic string compositions for some of the darker scenes. All in all, between the drunken antics of Cage's character, the jazzy score, and the wild and wonderful scenery of Las Vegas and the assortment of colorful side characters- there are heart-achingly intimate scenes of love at it's most desperate and it is all masterfully put together by Mike Figgis and company.",Leaving Las Vegas
295,johnfletch1,A 'Hauntingly' powerful film,10,5 February 2005,"This movie haunts me. As a recovering alcoholic, I can relate to this story of a man whom in my opinion has accepted his alcoholism but has decided that it is futile if not impossible to attempt to live a life that will be 'normal' in the eyes of others.To suggest that this is not the most powerful acting performance ever undertaken by anyone in the past or present will gain an argument from me on every ocassion. 'Cage' is brilliant in this role and is supported with a terrific cast of others, particularly the woman whose name escapes me (and I apologise for that) that plays the role of a prostitute. Alcoholics hate being judged or having negative opinions thrown at them and no doubt women that take money for sexual liasons are in the same boat in that regard. A hauntingly brilliant movie that not only moved me but also ripped into the souls of so many that are directly or indirectly affected by the consequences of addiction.The soundtrack is also superb. 9 out of 10 because nothing is perfect. This however comes very close!",Leaving Las Vegas
296,MikiUK,Cartoon alcoholism and gratuitous misogyny - Cage wins Oscar for unwittingly hilarious performance!,2,14 February 2005,"So tell me - what serious boozer drinks Budweiser? How many suicidally-obsessed drinkers house a fully stocked and barely touched range of drinks in their lonely motel room that a millionaire playboy's bachelor-pad bar would be proud to boast? And what kind of an alcoholic tends to drink with the bottle held about 8 inches from his hungry mouth so that the contents generally spill all over his face? Not to mention wasting good whisky by dousing your girlfriend's tits with it, just so the cinema audience can get a good eyeful of Elisabeth Shue's assets.Cage seems to be portraying the most attention-seeking look-at-me alcoholic ever to have graced the screen while Shue looks more like a Berkely preppy slumming it for a summer than some seasoned street-walker. She is humiliated and subjugated as often as possible in this revolting movie with beatings, skin lacerations, anal rape and graphic verbal abuse - all of it completely implausible and included apparently only to convey a sense of her horribly demeaned state and offer the male viewers an astonishingly clichéd sentimental sexual fantasy of the 'tart-with-a-heart'.Still - I did watch it to the end, by which time I was actually laughing out loud as Shue's tough street hooker chopped carrots in the kitchen wanly, pathetically smiling while Cage - all eyes popping and shaking like like a man operating a road drill in an earthquake - grimaced and mugged his way through the final half-hour...",Leaving Las Vegas
297,Flixfixed,Catharsis!,10,17 April 2005,"This movie does for me what, maybe, a 100 shrinks could not have done....In one of the best essayed roles played by any actor across generations, Nicholas Cage drags his way through the movie to a wholly welcome release of death and permanently etches his place in the psyche of the viewers.And to give him company on this journey to inevitable destruction as the archetypal ""golden-hearted hooker"", Elizabeth Shue delivers one of the most riveting performances ever.What exists between them is not mere ""chemistry"" - it is a the deepest underlying bond between two human beings, one still fighting for her right to redemption (Shue), and another who is beyond redemption of any kind (Cage). The two of them bring out every conceivable emotion that could exist in a living breathing human heart, tugging at them mercilessly so much so that towards the end of movie you are torn - one part of you wants them to succeed against all odds, and the other part actually sighs with relief at the welcome end of Cage's miserable existence.Seriously depressing, this movie is certainly not for those who seek entertainment - it is almost like therapy. It is a catharsis of all that inside us which makes us human - sad, happy, dejected, hopeful, angry, loving...Also, strongly recommended that you follow up this movie with a light-hearted ""happy"" movie..This movie deserves a 11 on a 10, and Cage his Academy...",Leaving Las Vegas
298,michaelyoung1025,the purest love ever appeared on earth,10,24 April 2005,"Allow me saying that I found true love in this dark movie.Almost nobody believes that pure love could ever happened between a drunker and a streetwalker,but mike Figgis had done it.The very thing that touched me most was the understanding between the two abandoned bodies.The society accept neither of them,so they chose to sell her soul to the devil or drunk to dead.And even love couldn't stop them from doing that.This lead me to see a brand new type of love that means love itself an nothing else.And only once that Sera tried to drag Ben back the normal life,she failed.And i think Shue deserved an Oscar for that scene,that's the touchiest acting I have ever seen till now.Or maybe it's familiar to me 'cause they're eating Chinese food(from my hometown) that moment.But in fact,I still cannot imagine how Susan beat Shue in Oscar.I mean Dead Man Walking is a good movie but Susan's acting was just flooded in Penn's,she's not so powerful as Shue did in this movie.Back to the point,I appreciate the kinda interview scene in this movie,it appeared four or five times and each time it give a summary of the point of view of the whole love.And it also give us a signal,Ben change nothing,the love change nothing,life should go on,decline will go on,but love has come.Isn'n it cruel?Or it just the reality's true face.After all,love is only love,when it comes nothing can change it;and when it gone ,it can change nothing.That's what this movie try to tell you in my opinion.",Leaving Las Vegas
299,info-4548,The Making of Leaving Las Vegas,10,28 April 2005,I have the DVD but can't seem to find The Making of Leaving Las Vegas. Where is it? and how can find it? Do I need to buy it separate? Exactly what do I click in the menu? I know there are hidden icons like the poker cards go to the actors backgrounds.I think this film is one of the finest movies ever made about love. Not to mention a reality check on booze. I watch it with other people to see their reaction. Some feel sick and other feel compasion. The ones that feel compasion are the goods ones. You know when you are watching with an alcololic when they say: That's happen to me. It's a good way to find out if the person you are dating has problems with booze. Thanks,Leaving Las Vegas
300,mardijamieson,leaving las vegas,10,2 June 2005,Leaving Las Vegas is my favorite movie. I think the acting is powerful and very riveting. I still try to watch it on a monthly basis.Nicholas Cage is extremely convincing as Ben.....and he definitely deserved an academy award for his performance.Both characters were so believable in their common struggles.The music in the movie adds to film....which was performed by Sting. I have recently bought the sound track and it is wonderful.I think the strong acting in the movie is easily connected with most peoples lives.......everyone runs from something at least once in their lives....exactly what Ben was doing.If you have not had the pleasure of seeing this movie I highly recommend it....the first time I watched it I found it quit depressing but watched it again and have not been able to stop since.Thank you so much,Leaving Las Vegas
301,patlarkin3,"wonderful film, good entertainment value, worth seeing again and again.",10,24 July 2005,"The film was very moving in it's content. Very realistic in that it could, and, probably has happened to someone so unhappy with life, that they've decided to stop 'living' and do the only other thing - perhaps, on the other hand, someone contemplating suicide, has watched Nic Cage's film, and has changed his/her mind and thought that perhaps life is worth having another go at. The background music was perfectly matched with the mood and the dizzy town of Las Vegas. Sting's rendition of 'My One and Only Love' was perhaps the most moving of all the songs/tunes. Great acting, great music and exceptionally well directed. I have never forgotten this film and it has a personal meaning for me too. Thanks to everyone concerned with the making of a truly great movie.",Leaving Las Vegas
302,tarek-14,The lasting effect,10,19 November 2005,"When my girlfriend recommended this film months ago I had no intention of watching it, the back of the case and her description really didn't sell it to me but when I went to bed the other night and she had it playing I watched a couple of minutes of it and thought I'd give it a try.What do I say, I found it one of the deepest things I'd ever seen and it moved me more than I ever thought a film could. It's been 4 days since I've seen it and I am still thinking about it and I am still feeling how i was while I was watching it, it's incredible. I've told everyone about it. I don't know why it's left me with this strange feeling but it has and I'm not sure when I'll stop feeling like this.It is definitely now my favourite film ever but I have no desire to ever watch it again. I say that because I have had such a great experience of the film I don't want to risk ruining it and I couldn't take another dose! Has this film effected anyone else in this way?",Leaving Las Vegas
303,blackmantired,Slow and overrated,4,25 July 2018,"I have watched this movie at least3 times, hoping that at each viewing it will get better. It never does. It never truly captures me. I find it slow, dull, and depressing. Nicholas cage's performance is one note. Elizabeth Shue gives a much more complex and varied performance. Her performance is much better than the material. Cannot see why Nicholas Cage won the Oscar. A slow, over rated piece of Hollywood claptrap. A forgettable movie with no outstanding scenes or dialogue.",Leaving Las Vegas
304,frightmare22,"great, but very disturbing",10,5 February 2006,"When I first heard about this movie i didn't know it was going to be so dark, but it was an amazing movie none the less. Nicholas Cage plays an amazing drunk who has a serious, and I mean serious drinking problem. By the end of the movie you just feel so sorry for him and hate to see what he has become. Elixabeth Shue is also amazing in this movie playing a prostitute that knows she is going nowhere and probably never will. If you haven't seen the movie stop reading this now. At the end of the movie you just hope these people will turn their lives around, but they don't, and Cage drinks himself to death and Shue continues to prostitute. It is a very hard movie to watch but it is an amazing movie, one of the best I have seen.",Leaving Las Vegas
305,agraham-13,It is depressing that more films like this aren't made in Hollywood,10,11 March 2006,"This is an unflinchingly poetic, humane film graced by compelling performances from Nicolas Cage and Elizabeth Shue, who is heartbreakingly convincing. She gives a subtle yet powerful performance as a character who is at once tough, vulnerable, tender, and - up to the moment he brings a prostitute back to their apartment - almost infinitely forbearing in her love for Ben. Shue's acting and the quality of the direction raise this film far beyond the 'hooker with a heart' clichés to which lesser films could have succumbed and she surely deserved an Oscar to sit alongside the one awarded to Nicolas Cage.Leaving Las Vegas shares with Midnight Cowboy its edgy direction, elegiac tone, and its focus on the relationship between two damaged but utterly sympathetic characters, played out against the backdrop of a garish and indifferent city.The only detraction is an occasionally obtrusive and clumsy soundtrack. Sting's contributions in particular strike a tone of crooning bathos at odds with the integrity of the film's narrative, direction and leading performances; at these points silence would have been more eloquent.Ultimately, though, this is a poignant and affirmative film and the dark sleaze of Las Vegas is illuminated by the relationship between Sera and Ben. At the film's close she says that she loved his 'drama'. So should we.",Leaving Las Vegas
