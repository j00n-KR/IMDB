0,TheLittleSongbird,Acceptable remake but not as good as the original,6,31 October 2009,"I did like this movie in general. There are some funny moments and the performances are spirited from the entire cast. Unfortunately, although as a remake it is acceptable it does have its weak spots. I didn't feel as though it had the charm of the original, by that I mean that doesn't quite have the irreverence and likability that made the original so endearing. There are some pacing problems and major discrepancies in the screenplay, plus the direction wasn't as strong as it could have been. On the whole though, it is not too bad. There is some nice scenery and camera work. The performances from the cast are fun; Steve Martin does very well in the title role, and the ensemble of children have strong chemistry. And despite the weak script, there are some funny moments, like the mince-in-the-trousers part. And there are some heart-warming parts like the ending. Overall, flawed but acceptable. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Cheaper by the Dozen
1,SnoopyStyle,fine slapstick family movie,6,3 August 2014,"Tom (Steve Martin) and Kate Baker (Bonnie Hunt) had big career dreams and big family dreams. The family wins out and they leave the big city. The kids don't stop coming until number 12. The oldest being played by Piper Perabo, Tom Welling, and Hilary Duff. There are also twins, lookalike girls, sad little boy, other girl, cute boy, chunkier boy, and smaller cute boy. Tom is a high school football coach who gets a chance at a bigger job. The family is forced to move to the city for his job where Nora (Piper Perabo) lives with her boyfriend Hank (Ashton Kutcher). With less time with the big job, Tom has to deal with everything else after Kate gets a book tour to NYC.Let's be obvious. There are too many kids. It becomes chaos not just in the house but in the story. It's just a series of wacky slapstick. It's general harmless family fun. If you don't have enough fun, the characters will keep smashing things up until you laugh. It's a lot pratfall fluff and not a lot of seriousness. There are some good silly fun pushing Kutcher around. Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt are definitely game for all the craziness.",Cheaper by the Dozen
2,claudio_carvalho,The Price of Having Children in the Dreams of a Couple,7,9 October 2004,"In a small town, the Bakers are a happy huge family: Tom Baker (Steve Martin) is the couch of a football team, married with the housewife Kate Baker (Bonnie Hunt) and having twelve children. Their lives change when Tom is invited to be the trainer of his dream team in the big city and Kate is invited to do a book tour to publish her book. The lives of the members of the Baker family become a chaos, with Tom alone with his sons and daughters being pressed for results by the owners of the team, the children missing their mother and having adaptation problems in the new town and Kate missing her family in the tour. Having children is an option in the life of a couple. Sometimes it means forget or postpone some of their dreams. 'Cheaper by the Dozen' exposes, in a funny and exaggerated way, the price of having children. Tom has to choose whether stays with the team of his dreams or returns to a small town. Kate has to choose whether stays in the book tour or returns to her family and sacrifice her books. In the end, it is a Hollywood family entertainment and everything resolves reasonably well. The forty-two years old Bonnie Hunt is still a very beautiful and elegant woman. The story is very funny and is a good family entertainment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil):'Doze é Demais' ('Twelve is Too Much')",Cheaper by the Dozen
3,jboothmillard,Cheaper by the Dozen,4,20 June 2007,"Some people think that the star of this film has become less funny in recent years, I can agree in some ways, but this is almost one near exception, from director Shawn Levy (remake of The Pink Panther, Night at the Museum). Basically, Tom Baker (Steve Martin) is a famous football coach who decides it is time for his family to get more space. He needs it, he and wife Kate (Jumanji's Bonnie Hunt) have had 12 kids together. Unfortunately, while she is away on a business trip, to promote her book for a while, the younger kids are causing havoc both in the house and the neighbourhood, and Tom has struggle with keeping them under control, not getting in the way of Kate's business, not paying attention to his teenagers, Nora (Piper Perabo), Charlie (Smallville's Tom Welling) Lorraine as Hilary Duff (apart from to ask to babysit, at inconvenient times), and of course, trying to achieve his dream of greater coaching opportunities. Also starring Kevin G. Schmidt as Henry Baker, Alyson Stoner as Sarah Baker, Small Soldiers' Jacob Smith as Jake Baker, Liliana Mumy as Jessica Baker, Morgan York as Kim Baker, Forrest Landis as Mark Baker, Blake Woodruff as Mike Baker, Brent and Shane Kinsman as twins Nigel and Kyle Baker, Paula Marshall as Tina Shenk, Steven Anthony Lawrence as Dylan Shenk, Ferris Bueller's Alan Ruck as Bill Shenk, The Core's Richard Jenkins as Shake, Without a Paddle's Dax Shepard as Camera Crew Member, Wayne Knight as Electrician and Dude, Where's My Car?'s Razzie nominated Ashton Kutcher as Hank. I think this is worth seeing for the funny chaotic events of young children, and Martin trying to sort it. Okay!",Cheaper by the Dozen

5,studioAT,Steve Martin returns...,6,18 June 2011,Steve Martin much like Eddie Murphy has had a second lease of life by doing this sort of family comedy fare and actually makes a decent job of playing a father surrounded by 12 very different children.There isn't really that much in the way of plot and many of the children blend into the background with Hillary Duff and Tom Welling being the only standouts and instead this film lets Martin play to his strengths as a big and physical comedian wife on screen wife Bonnie Hunt merely just playing the straight woman to his buffoonery.This film has far more laugh out loud moments than the sequel that followed it and is well worth hunting out to see a good performance from Martin and some nice family entertainment.,Cheaper by the Dozen
6,anaconda-40658,Cheaper but Entertaining Update.,6,21 April 2016,"Cheaper by the Dozen (2003): Dir: Shawn Levy / Cast: Steve Martin, Bonnie Hunt, Hilary Duff, Piper Perabo, Ashton Kutcher: Wholesome comedy about the cost and struggles of raising a large family. The film stars Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt with background information given how they came to have twelve kids. Martin coaches football and Hunt quit her job at the Chicago Tribune to raise the children. Martin is given the opportunity to coach the team that he has always desired to coach but to do so he must move the family four hours away. Once settled, Hunt is off on a book tour. Although formula in structure and perhaps too many kids to keep track of the conclusion is heart warming. Well directed by Shawn Levy who previously made the dreadful and unfunny Big Fat Liar. Martin and Hunt are terrific thanks to complex roles. They bring realism to the marriage relationship highlighting the struggles. The fact that they become a stronger family unit in the conclusion is predicted. The kids are played by a variety of sorts including Hilary Duff and Piper Perabo among others. Ashton Kutcher is even featured as Perabu's self absorbed boyfriend. The premise becomes the film's weakness when factoring that none of these kids are very interesting. Despite that, there are very amusing moments and a theme stressing that raising a family isn't cheap but it can be rewarding. Score: 6 ½ / 10",Cheaper by the Dozen
7,HotToastyRag,Cute family flick,7,27 August 2019,"After Father of the Bride was such a success, it was a no-brainer as to who would play the overwhelmed dad in the remake of Cheaper by the Dozen: Steve Martin! When you watch him in it, and the subsequent sequel, you start to believe he really has a dozen kids of his own and is drawing from his actual experiences to perfectly portray the frazzled parent with an endless supply of love. How hilarious is it that he hadn't yet experienced fatherhood when he made these movies? Just as I'll always associate Dennis Quaid as the dad in The Parent Trap, I'm sure there are millennials out there who think of Steve Martin as the quintessential papa from all these movies.Without a doubt, the section that will keep every parent laughing is when Bonnie Hunt leaves for her book tour, leaving Steve Martin in charge of their dozen. It's more than just a comedy routine, it's a realistic circus that looks familiar to anyone with even two children, let alone twelve. When Steve gets fed up and tells his kids they're grounded, one responds with, ""What's grounded?""With a soundtrack that will keep the teenagers happy, lots of small children to keep the little ones happy, and exhausted parents to keep the exhausted parents happy, you can definitely rent this one for family night. Depending on how sentimental you're feeling at the time, you might even get a lump in your throat as Steve gets to show off his acting chops towards the end of the movie.DLM warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Steve Martin hangs from the chandelier, the camera spins and it will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",Cheaper by the Dozen
8,Smells_Like_Cheese,"I had to force myself to rent it, but I actually kinda liked it",6,14 November 2006,"I never had no interest in seeing Cheaper By The Dozen, despite how much I'm enjoying my Steve Martin movies, I cannot stand Hilary Duffy, she annoys the heck out of me. Sad and shallow I know, but hey, we've all been there with an actor or actress. This Cheaper By The Dozen also took a different twist on the original and you can tell that this wasn't faithful the true story, but that's OK, I understand with the whole ""family film"" generation of today.The parents in this film are a bit different, they are trying to have two careers, especially successful one's. But obviously, that's going to be hard since the kids are having a hard time moving to a new town for their dad's job. Despite having more money and a bigger house, the kids aren't excepted at school and the parents are busier with their jobs, especially since mom is on a trip in New York, she leaves the kids with Dad for a couple weeks! You can in some ways understand why Ashton Kutcher was uncredited and this movie had some really really... really predictable moments of a typical family film in today's Hollywood, but Steve Martin really did make the film work. Although, I'm not sure if I was supposed to feel more sorry for the parents than those kids because quite frankly, a lot of those kids were brats! 6/10",Cheaper by the Dozen
9,=G=,Gags,5,7 April 2004,"The obvious ""Baker's dozen"" pun in this knock-off of the 50's hit ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" signals the lack of creativity which is present everywhere between the credits. A typically commercial Hollywood product pumped up with B-list talent such as Hunt,  Razzie nom'd Kutcher, Perabo, and Duff and an uninspired cornball screenplay, this tale of two parents coping with their careers and a family of 14 is just one old joke after another. Family fare for the less discriminating film goer, ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" is a busy no-brainer romp which received less than sterling reviews and public acceptance and may well create more gags in the audience than it does on screen.

10,MovieAddict2016,Poor Steve Martin,4,10 December 2005,"""Cheaper By the Dozen"" would have at least been an amusing film if it hadn't already been made about a hundred times before. In the early stages of production I was actually misled into thinking it was a direct adaptation of the book, and was excited to see how they'd pull that off. Little did I know the title is all the film has in common with its source.Steve Martin plays Tom Baker, an average Joe with twelve kids who drive him insane. When he decides to chase after the money and head out to the big city, his kids throw a fuss and protest by performing ""hilarious"" physical comedy that will ""have you in stitches."" I suppose we're meant to sympathize with the little brats. The problem is that it's hard to find sympathy for the spawn of Satan. I felt like slapping the kids and throwing them out the window of a thousand-foot skyscraper.Ashton Kutcher makes a ""delightful"" cameo. Just what we need - another ugly mug from MTV grinning at the camera.What happened to Steve Martin? Why on earth did he feel the need to star in this film? Was it just the money? Was it the prospect of pretending to have Bonnie Hunt as a wife? Or was it trying to appeal to the masses again and using children's familiarity with Hilary Duff to reintroduce himself into the family market and therefore appeal to his own children? Is he really that pathetic? Please, Steve...come back...we miss you. Stop doing this. Do you really want to end up like Eddie Murphy? Oh, wait. Too late.",Cheaper by the Dozen

12,g-bodyl,Funny and Original!,8,21 December 2007,"I bought this film expecting nothing more than a dud. I figured out that I was wrong during the first 10 minutes of the film. This film is based upon the 1946 novel by Frank Bill Gilbreth Jr and the plot line is about a father and mother raising 12 children. Along the way, many unexpected, hilarious thing happen. First, I thought the story was great. It is better than the original film and it's even more original than the first film. The acting was well done. The chemistry between all the actors is unusually good. Steve Martin was a perfect fit for his role. Bonnie Hunt and all the kids did a good job as well. The only thing that was messed up was Ashton Kutcher. He was not really good, but that is all that is wrong. I recommend this movie. I rate this movie a 8/10.",Cheaper by the Dozen

15,tabuno,Above Average Big Family Comedy,7,25 January 2019,"18 January 2004. This updated, contemporary comedy about a big family his plenty of laughs and warm post-holiday season spirit to make it entertaining. The blend of humor and drama seems to be getting better as the American film industry proceeds into newer territory with more harder edged comedies. Cheaper by the Dozen does struck credibility unncessarily and exaggerates situations to the point of disbelieve...the ensuing chaos while funny, it gets to be a bit nauseating...with some many children (twelve of them) many of the plotlines get papered over and a lingering sense of disappointment descends on the individual plotlines that seem only half played out. The movie has good interaction, great chuckle scenes, good use of drama and emotional conflict and is a much more grown up motif than past children movies. The industry standard is moving upwards though its still has a way to good in terms of quality features. This movie is above average and a good vehicle in the family comedy genre.

Its the kind of movie that if you see a swimming pool, you know someone's going to fall into it. But that's okay. Most of the other jokes are funny. There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments.

22,ianlouisiana,Toe - curlingly cutesy - wutesy slice of American pie.,3,3 November 2007,"""Cheaper by the dozen"" will make you yearn for the straightforward sublime idiocy of ""The Jerk"" or perhaps,if you prefer Steve Martin as Woody Allen to Steve Martin as Jerry Lewis,the schadenfreunde of ""Parenthood"". It is overwhelmingly ""American"" with a capital A in both its conception and its execution.All the men have been emasculated,from Mr Martin himself to his youngest sons,the women manipulate them at will,belittle them at every opportunity and are unbearably smug control freaks. Mr Martin appears to be unable to choose a pair of socks without consulting his wife/dominatrice and goes through the whole movie behaving like an elderly Labrador surrounded by a brood of boisterous puppies.The puppies/children are unfailingly obnoxious in that irritating All American way that presumably some American child must possess unless it is entirely an invention of Hollywood. As an elderly Englishman I find it hard to believe that presumably fairly intelligent middle - class American parents would concede control of their family to their older offspring - and that is suspending my initial disbelief that any such prosperous a couple would have twelve children in the first place.With the original movie set in 1920 such a scenario was just about believable - but in the 21st century in a world already grossly overcrowded? Which brings us to the question of why was this movie ever made?Does Mr Martin need the money?I don't think so.Does the world need yet another cruddy remake of a film that although amusing enough was hardly a great classic?Are screenwriters so devoid of original ideas that they are forced to plunder their own archives?

Yes, silly is another word that applies to this movie. It is light fare, so light that it floats like a feather, going from one silly scene to another. Oh, another word to describe this movie is cute. Cute is nice but is it entertaining? Is it dramatic? Is it funny? The answer to all three questions is an emphatic no. A movie that cannot be taken seriously is either campy or a comedy and while this movie is not campy it isn't particularly funny either. Other words to describe this movie are schmaltzy, hokey and corny. This movie has the dramatic power of a fair weather cloud.

Too much of the dialogue in this is cheesy, and it builds up making this film just annoying to watch. Kids probably won't mind because they don't expect much from a movie. I think Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt are quite good, but they have so little to work with, especially since neither of them has very funny material and all of the humor goes to the kids, and to my next high point, Ashton Kutcher.

25,Gislef,Depressing cookie-cutter family-flick,3,31 December 2003,"I found this an odd movie - despite the fact it's a supposed comedy, it reminded me of a gloomy version of Daddy Daycare. Turn loose some screaming kids and you've got 75% of your flick. Steve Martin seems oddly miscast - there's a few moments when he goes into his ""schtick"" that stand out like a sore thumb (like when Mom drives away to New York and he does ""mad scientist Steve""). But basically this is a guy running his family into the ground because of putting his personal dreams before his kids. Wow, what a good cheery family concept! Yeah, by the end he's learned a valuable lesson (as presumably so have we), but one suspects most of the kids will be traumatized for life.Bonnie Hunt is likeable enough as always - Tom Welling seems pretty much wasted as a sulky teenager who gets picked on and goes through several changes of character for no reason. I'm heading home, Dad. I'm moving out. I'm going to stay. I hate you. You were right. Welling doesn't have that much screen-time and it seems every time he appears on screen he's got a different personality. Hillary and Piper are tolerable. Ashton Kutcher is...well, Ashton Kutcher. He's annoying but since we're supposed to be rooting for the family against him, that's not too surprising. he's a bit too broad, though.The movie really belongs to the kiddies - Bill Mumy's kid is cute, as is the Landis boy, a newcomer. They're all annoyingly precocious but that's pretty much par for the course with such movies. The supporting cast of non-family members don't have much to do and truth be told, the film is busy enough with the family subplots as it is. But sheesh, overall, this movie seems to go a bit too far into the third-act pit of depression and tragedy before pulling it together for an upbeat conclusion.",Cheaper by the Dozen
26,mjw2305,Not very impressed,5,29 December 2006,"Cheaper by the Dozen Sees Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt thrust together as the parents of 12 rambunctious kids. I can't deny that they both play their respect roles convincingly and Martin is typically slap-stick and humorous throughout.I just found the idea and the execution a little dull and predictable, and it could definitely have been funnier. No single person or thing lets this film down at all, it just feels boring and tired after only 30 minutes of viewing, which means you'll probably be waiting for it to end for over an hour.I'm sure it has an audience who will love it, but seriously if you want a good family comedy, try 'Freaky Friday' 'Elf' or 'Bend it like Beckham' to name just a few.Not awful, but trying it's damnedest to get there 5/10",Cheaper by the Dozen

I'm a little confused over which group of people is supposed to see the appeal in this? If you're childless like me, you'll probably vow forever to remain so, and if you have any more than one kid you'll start thinking that this is where you should stop. It's hardly an advert for the traditional 'Nuclear Family' - in fact, the film is a little confused as to the message it's sending... ""We had one perfect child and then decided we should stop"", versus, ""This rabble aren't a bad bunch, really""...Perhaps it's aimed at the middle-aged retired suffering from the pangs of the 'Empty Nest' syndrome... ? Not a demographic Steve Martin should really be pitching to, but then; with his mostly 'toothless' output since the eighties, maybe there are plans afoot to make him a 'life peer'?! Kids being unsubtle, that's it's stock-in-trade, so it's really only for you if you like your humour childish at heart. ""Organised"" chaos? You bet, 'cos in real-life it wouldn't be this much of a breeze! Oh, there are the expected mini-dramas of 'neglect' and diminutive runaways, but when the brood are all together it's really shown as a 'wacky' time - no 'kitchen-sink reality' included. I suppose that's really where I give the movie its one plus-point; you tend to believe this cast as a 'family unit' - no small feat when you consider the age ranges. In the sequel, if they show them at each others throats; then perhaps I'll make a concession and give credit where credit is due, just not here.",Cheaper by the Dozen

29,BrandtSponseller,"Not as good as the original, but still very good",9,22 January 2005,"Tom (Steve Martin) and Kate Baker (Bonnie Hunt) have a Baker's dozen--children, that is. When Tom, a football coach, gets a job offer to coach a college football team just outside of Chicago, and Kate's book about raising 12 children finally gets a publishing offer, they see bright things for their future. The only problem is that their 12 children do not want to move from their rural Illinois home, and things become nearly disastrous when Kate has to leave for a couple weeks to promote her book.While I didn't enjoy Cheaper By The Dozen as much as the original version of the film from 1950, the 2003 ""re-imagining"" is still a 9 out of 10 for me (the original was a 10 out of 10 for me). It's a re-imagining rather than a remake because although the overall plot arc has some similarities, these are two very different films, with very different messages, and very different kinds of families. Both are rather cartoonish, which works for me--I don't require much realism in my films. For anyone who is looking for something primarily believable, Cheaper By The Dozen may not fit the bill.The major change from the original to the new film is a change from control to near-chaos. In the Baker's case, it doesn't take long to realize that the chaos arises from their lack of disciplining their children. While this may not be realistic (surely anyone planning to have a family this large would realize that discipline and control would be necessary to not have one's home destroyed), it does lead to a lot of comic situations, and that's really the point here. Yes, there is a message in the end about putting family first, but what director Shawn Levy really wants you to do is laugh. My wife and I laughed quite a bit while watching the film, so Levy accomplished his goal with us. My only slight complaint on this end was that some of the funniest material involved the eldest Baker daughter's boyfriend, Hank (Ashton Kutcher), and he just wasn't in the film enough. The material about the Shenk's, neighbors of the Baker's, was also funny and a bit underused. This was the reason for lowering my score 1 point.The rest of the cast is good, although like the original Cheaper By The Dozen, we barely get to know some of the children, but that's understandable when we have to deal with 14 characters as well as ancillary characters. Steve Martin was excellent, as always (I enjoy his work in even his less popularly appreciated films), and although Hilary Duff (as daughter Lorraine Baker) seemed a bit odd in the context of the family, I enjoyed her performance a lot, also. There's something about her that I like, and it's not just her looks.",Cheaper by the Dozen

I am not going to say too much about this film other than the fact that I had fun. I'll admit that some of the film was silly, but the film still works.

32,Beta_Gallinger,Another PG-rated family comedy that forgets about the laughs,5,4 July 2010,"I rented this movie just yesterday, knowing that Steve Martin was in it, but not knowing that it was a remake of a movie from 1950 and both films were adapted from a book of the same name, until after I came home from the video store and looked it up. So, I obviously can't say I've ever read the book or seen the original film adaptation, but I'm thinking they're both better liked than this remake. Before watching this 2003 version, I knew that it certainly didn't have the worst reputation a comedy film can have, but also knew that it generally wasn't considered that great, so I didn't have very high expectations. Still, I thought it could turn out to be a mixed blessing, with some really funny parts and some unfunny ones, but I didn't even get that.Tom and Kate Baker both wanted eight kids when they got married, but due to several factors, they have ended up with twelve! They now live in a large rural home in Midland, Indiana with their offspring. When Tom gets an offer to coach the Stallions, meaning he will get to fulfill his old dream of being a head football coach, he happily takes it, but this means the family will have to move to Chicago, which none of the twelve siblings are happy about. Nonetheless, the family does move, into another large house in a Chicago suburb, and this causes some dysfunction. Kate's dream also comes true when she is informed that the book she has written will be published. She has to go to New York to promote her book, leaving Tom to look after all the kids on his own, and he soon finds that it is VERY difficult trying to keep them under control! It also looks like Kate will be gone longer than originally expected for a book tour! Showing Tom Baker (Steve Martin's character) jogging home, the film is off to a mediocre start. It doesn't improve with Bonnie Hunt's opening narration as Kate Baker. It's certainly not very funny at this point, and the part about Tom getting a vasectomy is awkward in what's supposed to be a family movie. Maybe that part would have been slightly funnier if the movie hadn't been billed as family. One memorably lame joke is one of the Baker kids being told that body parts don't count for show-and-tell. In fact, this part is perhaps a little disturbing! There are some occasional mildly amusing moments in this version of ""Cheaper by the Dozen"", but for the most part, it's very unfunny and boring, with the pranks the kids pull, such as soaking Hank's (Nora Baker's boyfriend) underwear in meat to attract dogs, other trouble the kids cause, etc. Another lame part I can't forget is the athletic cup covered in sauce, which one of the kids sees and thinks the sauce is blood, causing him to throw up! This remake of ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" is basically just another unfunny PG-rated family comedy, and like some of the others, some parts might really make viewers wonder if it should have been marketed as a family movie. For the most part, this movie is cheesy and fairly forgettable, and it reminded me a lot of ""Daddy Day Care"", another no more than mediocre PG-rated family film which was released the same year. Apart from an occasional mildly amusing scene and Steve Martin's charm (he's not that funny here but definitely better than he is in ""Looney Tunes: Back in Action""), there aren't many positive things I can say about 2003's ""Cheaper by the Dozen"". I'm not even sure if my 5/10 rating is low enough. I do intend to watch the 1950 version at some point, knowing it's obviously a lot different because of the era it's from. I will also be expecting the original to be better than this disappointing 2003 version.",Cheaper by the Dozen
33,CitizenCaine,"Funny Moments, But Nothing Really New",6,11 April 2004,"Clifton Webb, Myrna Loy, and Jeanne Crain starred in the original film Cheaper By The Dozen, 1950. In it, Webb was the stern, but fair patriarch of a 1920's family of twelve kids. He was an efficiency expert, who ran his family like a business, saving time where ever possible. Myrna Loy was the loving, devoted wife and mother. Jeanne Crain was the oldest child, yearning for independence. The film was charming, corny, funny, and heartwarming simultaneously. Fast forward to 2003. We have Steve Martin playing the Webb role as a Mr. Mom with serious ""lack of ability to discipline"" issues. Bonnie Hunt plays the Loy role as a wife and mother that can do no wrong. Piper Perabo plays the oldest child with idiotic Ashton Kutcher as her boyfriend. Kutcher becomes, literally, the butt of several jokes played on him by the various siblings. Truthfully though, a guy that doesn't want kids of his own would have nothing to do with a girl in such a large family. Tom Welling plays the oldest son, who doesn't want to leave the small town the family leaves behind. This is a source of one of the many sit-com type plot complications the movie takes on. Teen sensation Hilary Duff is the next to oldest daughter, who has little to do but make silly fashion comments and blend in with the other siblings. Alyson Stoner stands out as chief mischief maker. This film does not resemble the original film in any manner, shape, or form. There are 12 kids, that is the only thing that remains. This film was funny at times, but ultimately, if you look below the surface, it was cloying and cutesy. For example, a movie like this might have been really fresh and funny decades ago; we wouldn't have expected kids to act like they did in this movie then. However, we live in an age now where kids take center stage at home, at school, at the store, at the gas station, etc. We are to believe that playing roller hockey on hardwood floors is funny? Relegating males, such as Steve Martin, Ashton Kutcher, and even Wayne Knight as the electrician, to buffoon status in family-oriented comedies has become a cliché. Therefore, the antics we experience at the hands of these kids (especially after Bonnie Hunt leaves) are neither fresh nor as funny as they could have been. The film begins to fall apart in the second half after Bonnie Hunt leaves on her book tour. The concluding scenes are all too cute and saccharine. Perhaps the main problem with the film is that it wavers between a wildly comic tone and trying to have a serious tone, without really being that serious. I think I would have enjoyed it more had it taken a more campy approach, spoofing family comedy situations of old in straight-faced fashion. There was a hint of this with the new, only child, neighborhood kid that had the overprotective mother. Even that was a bit of a cliché though. What do you expect from a movie that steals its title from a charming, corny, funny, and heartwarming film, and is not charming, corny, or that funny or heartwarming itself? **1/2 of 4 stars.",Cheaper by the Dozen

The movie offers lots of laughs, a small look at getting to know each kid and some heart warming moments.

Its the sort of movie that when you see it its exactly how you imagined it. You feel like you may as well not have watched it because you could imagine it exactly without seeing it. No surprises, in other words - too many cliches. Father trying to cope with 12 kids while mum's away on a book tour - of course the kiddies are gonna misbehave. No matter that this doesn't really fit with the kids' characters - who don't seem to be misbehavers. They just misbehave when it suits the comedic situation to have them do so.The comedy is quite lowbrow - perhaps because the director is the guy who made Just Married. Thus the predominance of cheap slapstick (bad slapstick is Funniest Home Video style laugh when people get injured stuff). And Steve Martin is probably the third thing that lets it down. He's just going through the motions here. He looks tired and distracted.There are some genuinely interesting things in it, but: the juxtaposition between the multi-sibling family and the various only-child families which abound in the film; and the children's book author whose kids call while she's doing a radio interview and beg her to come home and take care of them.And I never thought i'd say it, but Ashton Kutcher is one of the comedic highlights of this movie. He shows a willingness to poke fun at himself and play the bad guy (but we already knew that), and he steals those scenes he's in. The other highlight is the trio of annoying neighbours, Tim, Dylan and Bill Shenk. 
6/10. Syruppy music and cliche situations make for an alternatively corny and nauseating movie. Its still okay for the family on a friday night though. Reasons to see it are: Ashton Kutcher, the trio of neighbours and skinny Wayne Knight: Seinfeld's Newman is about a quarter the man he used to be! Its a thing to see!",Cheaper by the Dozen

38,Min111,That's a large family,8,7 August 2020,"It's a family of twelve people. Fourteen if you include the parents. Amazing. You guessed it - it's a big family. A large family. One of the largest families you'll ever see on a television screen. In a movie that is. Most people have a small family which is considered normal, but for the Baker family, it's nothing except normal. Twelve is a big number. That's why they call it a dozen. I thought Cheaper by the Dozen was a very good movie. I've gave it a very good rating - think it's worth at least eight stars. It was funny. It's a comedy movie worth checking out. It's a family movie. A family movie for the entire family to see. The family will like it. It's a movie that can teach you a lot of things. That's what I like most about Cheaper by the Dozen. I've learnt plenty. One of the things I've learnt is the 'importance' of having a family whether large or small. I have a large family (half the size by the way), so I can relate to them in some way. I understand what having a large family is about. The Baker parents, Tom and Kate, have twelve (dozen) children. While Tom's wife is away on a tour promoting her book, he has the massive job in looking after his children. Surely, it can't be this easy. Another problem for Tom is that he also has to manage his football team - something very important to him. It's a big career for him. Surely, it can't get any more harder. Is Tom up to the task? What's more important to Tom? His children or football team? You need to see it to find out. It gets hilarious from there. These are the names of the twelve children: Charlie, Henry, Jake, Jessica, Kim, Kyle, Lorraine, Mark, Mike, Nigel, Nora and Sarah. They're the Baker's! That's seven boys and five girls in the family. Nora is Tom and Kate Baker's oldest daughter, and Charlie is their oldest son. The rest are kids - it's these children Tom has to deal with. Tom asks his eldest daughter, Nora, to help him look after the kids which she agrees to along with her partner Hank. The character, Hank, is someone the children don't like. Hank doesn't like them either. There seems to be a rivalry between Hank and the children. Tom has a challenging task ahead of him managing the children as well as the football team. The most interesting character of the lot is Lorraine. I say that cause she was played by Hilary Duff who is a very popular actress. I remember her very well in Casper Meets Wendy. (That was a good movie by the way.) She's a good actress. She was fine as the girl. It's the other children that concerns Tom. I also like that it's called Cheaper by the Dozen. It's a funny way to call it. Raising twelve children can't get any cheaper. That's why it's Cheaper by the Dozen. There's also a sequel called Cheaper by the Dozen 2, but it's definitely not as good as the first. That's what I think. You should check Cheaper by the Dozen out.",Cheaper by the Dozen

Tom is a head football coach at a University in Illinois while his wife works as an editor of a newspaper who happens to be working on her novel based on the life of having a dozen children. The actors who play the children rank from Piper Perabo from Coyote Ugly, Tom Welling from the hit TV show ""Smallville"", Hilary Duff from Lizzie McGuire, and Alyson Stoner, who danced for many singers from Eminem to Missy Elliot, is a show stealer.The premise of the film involves Tom getting a chance to make it into the big leagues by coaching a big time football university where at the same time Kate has received news that her book is going national and she has to go on tour leaving her husband to take care of their twelve children. Kate has doubts but Tom says he can handle it.Yeah, right! Overall, Cheaper by the Dozen may just be another family comedy film filled with goofiness and laughter, but there's a charm to it.

I was almost instanteously engaged until over halfway through the movie trying to keep track of who was who, and with such a talented and diverse ensemble, I enjoyed watching all of the development, especially Mark (Forest Landiss), the kid who kind of tied the whole story together. They even found room for overrated stars like Ashton Kutcher and Hillary Duff as one-note characters among the others. I also think that underneath all the comedy there was a lot of moral value within the conflicts between Steve Martin and his family and all those people trying to tear it apart (like the coach and his fame-career-driven attitude and Ashton Kuthcer's character and his narcissism and the bullies at school and Paula Marshall and her preppy conformity).",Cheaper by the Dozen

How does it hold up today?,10,3 June 2020,"""Cheaper by the Dozen"" (2003), this movie follows a very similar history like the ""Flubber"" movie adaptations. This film, along with the remake, are both so much better than the original! Once in a great while, Hollywood gets a remake just right and sometimes they get one better than the original movie. ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" is the epitome of a perfect remake, in my opinion. Perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects and a perfect soundtrack. The storyline was so much better handled in this film compared to ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" (1950). You have a great plot to work off of, with so much potential. You have a mother and father raising 12 children. Let the hilarity and hijinks ensue! This movie had what the original movie lacked, over the top moments and comedy. Think about it, how many mothers and fathers can claim to have that many children? For a film of this perspective, you want it to be funny and you want it to be over the top. That's exactly what this movie delivers and then some! It does have a few emotional and hard-hitting moments, but, it intertwines with the comedic moments perfectly. As for the acting, all of the actors and actresses give stellar performances. The casting is absolutely perfect, and compared to the original film, each character has their own unique personality. Therefore, the chemistry between the characters is sublime. The shining star of course is Steve Martin himself. He is one of my top 10 all-time favorite comedy actors and one of the biggest factors to why a movie like this was able to work in the first place. Had someone else played his role, it may not have worked at all. Props to the casting agents! All of the sets/locations are fantastic and give the movie a great atmosphere. The special effects are perfect and still hold up today. Finally, the soundtrack is brilliant. It really helps to tie the film together and bring it to life. Great work, Christophe Beck! ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" is comedy gold, and overall an excellent family film. I could watch this film over and over and never get bored with it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you enjoy the ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" novel and haven't seen either of the films, stay away from the original movie. You will be very disappointed! Just watch this movie and it's sequel instead.

Although it is far from the best family film ever or the best Steve Martin or Bonnie Hunt film, it is still very nice and very cute. I enjoyed watching this film so will too. Their are also very sad scenes. For example, when the father is going to the train station after he finds out his son is there he goes into a train and his son is in one of the seats with his dead frog in a box. Anyway, this is an enjoyable film that I am pretty sure that you will like. This is just a good film, but not the best by far.6/10Recommended Films: Cheaper By The Dozen 2.",Cheaper by the Dozen
51,masoncheek,Atrocious.,1,30 July 2020,"This is a dumb movie filled with annoying whiny babies. Its also made for annoying whiny babies with the attention span of a rock, but I stand by my 1 star rating. Don't show this to your kids.",Cheaper by the Dozen
52,ScottDMenzel,"A near perfect film that is funny, touching, and well acted.",8,4 January 2004,"I for one was looking forward to Cheaper By the Dozen. I seen the trailer many times and I enjoyed it. I also really like Steve Martin, Hilary Duff & Piper Perabo. But I figured when I walked into the theater to see Cheaper by the Dozen it will probably be a ok film but nothing more. I was pleasantly surprised that the critics where wrong (once again) about the film and I was in for a very heartfelt and touching experience.Cheaper by the Dozen is one of the finer Mainstream release movies I have seen all year. The movie is extremely enjoyable for both kids and adults and is very touching. The movie is about the Baker Family. The Baker Family is not the ordinary family they have 12 kids. Yes 12 Kids. As the movie first starts out, the family lives in Illinois where they are very happy living in a small town and feel right at home. Even though they are not rich, they are happy. So one day Tom Baker (Steve Martin) gets a visit from an old friend who offers him a job he could only dream about. This also means that the family will move, and the family will have a lot more money then they currently have, so Tom & Kate (Bonnie Hunt) talk to the kids about the move but all the kids don't want to move. Tom & Kate continue with the move and force anyone to move. They move to this big town in Chicago where it seems they do not belong. This is when Cheaper by the Dozen gets started and lots of comedic, touching and moving moments proceed.The acting was very good in this film. I enjoyed Steve Martin playing in a different role. Sure he was his funny man self for some of the movie, but he was also the caring & careless father for the other part. It was great to see him show some emotions. Bonnie Hunt was also good as Kate. I really felt she cared about the kids as though they were her own kids. Piper Perabo, who was great in Lost & Delirious, played the older mature daughter Nora in the film. Nora was basically dealing with the question, what is more important to me my family or my boyfriend? The downside to her character was she wasn't in the film as much as I would have liked to see her in it since she's such a wonderful actress but while she was in the film, she played her character very well. Hilary Duff played the second eldest daughter Lorraine and she played her character well, even though at times I doubt she played the role since it seemed like the perfect role for her. Tom Welling was great as the oldest brother Charlie who was mad at his dad for not thinking about anyone except himself throughout the movie and trying to deal with fitting in the new city. And as for the rest of the kids, well they were probably the finest kid actors I have ever seen in a mainstream movie and all played the roles wonderfully. I also have the mention Ashton Kutcher (who I really can't stand) but I liked him in this role. Maybe its because the whole film all he did was make fun of himself. He said the perfect line in the film `I am not a good actor, It's my face that gets me places' I couldn't agree with him more. It was really good time seeing him make fun of himself.The script was great! Craig Titley, who wrote Scooby Doo, which was a pretty bad film, has made a great recovery from that film by writing this one. I enjoyed the movie a lot as I am sure you have already picked up from my review so far. I liked the script because it showed how real family life can be if parents actually took the time to raise their kids right. It was a nice movie which showed the family going from barely having any money but being happy to having all the money in the world and everyone in the family suffering from it. It was nice to see a script that mixed both comedic and dramatic moments so perfectly. I would like to say good job Craig Titley I applaud your work on this script, keep it up.The director, Shawn Levy, did a great job on directing the movie. He knew how to put the movie together. I was surprised Shawn Levy did such a great job on this film since his last films were Just Married (which made my 10 worse movies of 2003 list) and the awful Big Fat Liar. It's amazing that he too was able to catch the emotions that were in the movie. The movie portrays the average family but in today's world I guess we can say the not so average family and how life is for them. It's a very moving movie as I already mentioned above and the director really caught all the difficulties and good moments in the Bakers lives.So in conclusion, Cheaper by the Dozen was every thing I hoped it to be. It was better than I expected it to be and touched me very deeply. I can relate to the movie in some sense since I also have 6 brothers and I see some of the problems arise although my family situation isn't like the movie on all levels. There isn't as much love and caring, as there should be in my family. It touched me because my family could have been like the Bakers if my brothers and I were raised with more supervision and if I had parents who cared a lot of about their kids. I think that's why I really got emotional at the end of the film and cried because it's sad but it's not really that sad that someone should cry at the end. I liked the movie a lot. It was very feel good and wholesome. It's not wholesome in a Disney sort of way but wholesome in a family type of way by portraying how a family should be. The film made my top 10 movies of 2003 list and I am glad to see it doing so well at the box office even though the dumb critics panned it. I cannot see anyone walking out of this film saying its bad. It's a film, which I think almost anyone can enjoy. It's not full of stupidity but has funny moments. It has some drama, which is always good in a film as well. To me the film is the perfect family dramedy. I give Cheaper by the Dozen a very high rating of a 9/10.",Cheaper by the Dozen

55,ilovedolby,Wayne Knight is the best part of the film!,6,16 January 2004,"Director Shawn Levy is up to his old tricks, making bad comedies again. For those of you who remember last years `Just Married' or `Big Fat Liar,' you know what I am talking about. I do not understand why most comedies in theaters now have to be so obvious. With Levy's new film `Cheaper by the Dozen,' which stars Steve Martin, a great comedian, the film still can not be saved-although he and Bonnie Hunt sure do help things along. The problem is that there is just too much conventionality here. 	Martin and Hunt play Tom and Kate Baker, whom have 12 children. Tom coaches football for a junior college and Kate is a writer, hoping to publish her book on their family. Remarkably, they manage to keep family life a priority. Every moment of the day is wild from little twin tikes running around to high school seniors. But the resemblance of day to day activities will soon change when Tom is offered a coaching position at the college that he graduated from. 	Unfortunately, the kids do not want to leave their home where they grew up or their friends at school. But the opportunity for a better income is too great for Tom and Kate to pass up. So they move to the city and at the same time, Kate finds out that her book is finally going to be published. She has to leave Tom with the kids for what turns out to be two weeks. As such, Tom is swamped trying to keep up with his family and his work. When Kate realizes that their home is disarray and Tom is at his wits-end, she rushes home. The two must now decide what is best for their family, as well as themselves. 	I'm going to step out on a limb and admit something that many critics are afraid to say-Hilary Duff needs to be stopped. I could not stand her in this role. Her whole Lizzy Maguire image has got to be dropped. One can only hope that if she continues in cinema, she will actually learn to act one day and stop playing such ditsy characters. I especially liked her touching tribute to Christmas with her song during the end credits, `What Christmas Should Be.' 	One thing I must admit, I actually thought the scenes with Ashton Kutcher were funny. He plays Hank and he is dating Nora (Piper Perabo), Tom and Kate's oldest child.  When they visit one day, the kids manage to trip Hank into a swimming pool. While his clothes are being washed and dried, the children manage to take them, immerse them in hamburger meat and proceed to dry them. As such, when Hank puts them on, the family dog attacks him and his clothes are ripped to shreds. Maybe the scene worked for me because I feel the same way about Kutcher that I do Duff. 	The best part of the film came about when an electrician comes by to fix a chandelier and always manages to fall down and break the chandelier. Wayne Knight plays the electrician, better known as Newman on TVs `Seinfeld.' 	`Cheaper By the Dozen' wants to get across the message that family is more important than anything else in life. Well thank you Director Levy for the enlightenment of such a touching film! What this film should really get across is that vasectomies are our friends. **1/2",Cheaper by the Dozen
56,Ronin47,Better than I expected (**1/2),6,1 February 2004,"This affable comedy about a family with 12 kids is nothing special, but perfectly ok for a lazy afternoon. Steve Martin plays the dad, who causes friction within the family by moving them from their home in the country to the suburbs when he gets a job coaching college football. Bonnie Hunt is the mother, who causes friction within the family by leaving for a book tour. Being aimed at young kids and their parents, it's all very predictable and crammed with corny life lessons, but since it's pretty enjoyable and not TOO pushy with its morals, I could enjoy it as well, even if it is annoyingly cutesy at times. I enjoyed the performances by Piper Perabo (""Lost and Delirious"") and Tom Welling (TV's ""Smallville"") as the two eldest children, and it certainly helps to have the always beautiful and intelligent Bonnie Hunt in the mix. Steve Martin doesn't re-invent the wheel with his performance, but is reliable as usual. The younger kids are a big, faceless mob, but it would probably be too much to ask to have all 14 members of the family be well-developed characters, so that's ok. Ironically, the funniest character in the film is played by someone I thought I hated: Ashton Kutcher. As Perabo's character's conceited model/actor boyfriend, Kutcher gives an amusing performance and shows willingness to poke fun at himself, which elevates my opinion of him substantially. Referring to his face, he says ""This is the moneymaker! I'm not that good an actor, I know that!"" Moments like that and a few others make ""Cheaper By The Dozen"" worth a look. There are much better movies out right now, but you could definitely do worse.",Cheaper by the Dozen
57,rcavellero,MORE THAN A DOZEN LAUGHS!,9,30 November 2003,"Walking into Cheaper by the Dozen a prepared myself for one of those annoying family comedies like House Arrest and Don't tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead(which I found entertaining). And waited for the movie to start so I could hate Hilary Duff just a little more with another annoying performance. However, i walked out of this film pleasently suprised. The film is nothing suprising and a little clliched. But it is genuine and the chemistry between the actors as a family seems quite well.  I can not see how they couldn't have had a great time making this flicik. The film stars Bonnie Hunt(wonderful and looking good) and Steve Martin(in perfect comedic form) as the parents of not one, not two but 12 chldren. The most memorable ones even though all of them turn in believable performances. Are by Piper Perabo(coyote Ugly) who is going out with  the sexy ashton Kutchner(Just Married) a self absorbed model/actor of commercials. Tom Welling(of Tv's Smallville)who is absolutely gorgeous and turns in a good performance and Hillary Duff Unfortunatly as the annoying perfect middle child of the family. And the film is just really about their relationship when they decide to move to a new town and what problems they encounter. The film moves along a genuinely funny but not hilarious pace and injects itself with intelligence and heart. The film is as smart as Disney's Freaky Friday remake and as heartwarming. This movie is mainly for a family based audience but I can't see anyone not enjoying this wonderful film.",Cheaper by the Dozen
58,skymovies,'Parenthood' Reloaded,5,16 January 2004,"Apparently, Ashton Kutcher is such a big star now that he goes uncredited (you know, like De Niro used to?). This shmaltzy and uninspired bit of family slapstick reunites him with the guy responsible for the abominable 'Just Married'. It hurts, but I have to admit that they've partially redeemed themselves - which shouldn't have been difficult.Everything here has been done before, but the cheerful tone makes it all passable enough until the horribly manipulative finale. There's an irritatingly pious undertone which suggests that there's something wrong with anyone who doesn't want or like loads of kids. The uptight neighbours' only child is a freak, the kiddyphobic boyfriend is a shallow, self-absorbed jerk, and virtually everyone else outside the family is unpleasant.And why is it that continuity is so bad in family comedies? When all those child-minding agencies ask how many kids they'll be babysitting, you'd think that Dad would remember that one of his kids has left home and one is old enough to look after himself, but he still keeps saying ""Twelve"". I suppose having him say ""Ten"" would be 17% less funny.This comment is longer than a movie this slight warrants.

Whoever wrote this movie clearly has not spend much time around kids at all. They dont seem to know how they act or how they even talk. The dialogue from the young kids is so trash its unbelievable.
I am also not so sure what the message of this movie is...
No kids are this horrible unless their parents are just downright stupid. This seems like a problem in parenting not rambunctious children's disease.
Also what even was the plot of this movie...
what a mess.
There were maybe 3 or 4 good/funny scenes. Ashton Kutcher was kinda funny, but a lot of the jokes are just so bad. It entertains though. It isn't boring.",Cheaper by the Dozen
60,travisimo,"Slightly Likable, but That's About It",6,23 April 2004,"There are some things about ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" that are fairly enjoyable.  It's a nice enough story that may move some people.  I can't claim that I was one of them, but I think my mom found the story to be sweet and touching.  The grown-up actors did a fairly nice job also.  There's something about Bonnie Hunt that you just can't help but like her.  She seems like a nice, down-to-earth person, and she fit into this role very well.  Also this movie showcased some rising stars like Tom Welling, Hilary Duff, and Piper Perabo (my personal favorite).However, there seems to be something manipulative about this movie. Speaking of the rising stars, they only appear in the movie sporadically.  I got the sense that they only showed up to work on this movie for just a few days and that the filmmakers found a way to fit them in just to put them on the movie poster.This movie is mostly about Steve Martin and a bunch of little kids.  I thought Mr. Martin did all right in this movie, and I respect him for the very impressive career he has built, but his role in this movie didn't really stand out to me.  Years from now, people are going to remember his groundbreaking stand-up career, his stints on ""Saturday Night Live,"" and for movies like ""The Jerk"" and ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,"" but I don't think many will look at ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" as a prime example of his comedic genius.As for the story, it's pretty predictable.  I saw what lesson this movie was trying to teach us from far away.  The kids, for the most part, just seemed bratty and annoying.  Then again, maybe their acting was effective, because after the movie, I felt exhausted and happy that I am just an uncle right now.My IMDb Rating: 6/10.  My Yahoo!

61,shrek2004,A fantastic movie.,8,11 January 2004,"Originally I did not want to see this movie, but my friends eitherwanted to see Chasing Liberty or Cheaper By The Dozen. I can'tstand Mandy Moore movies so I agreed to this. I was expecting a movie with lots of gags, little plot, lots of bratsrunning around and toilet humour. Well I was pleasently surprised.The movie is actually story-driven, not joke driven, as a lot are.There are some bathroom humour jokes but they are quick andwell done. The ""brats"" are actually good actors and useexpression and style to portray their characters. Although thismany charactars can be hard to track, the movie solves this bymaking some kids more important charactars, but giving equalscreen time to all. The screenplay is good and the writing is solid. The jokes aretasteful and the charactars are likeable. The gags are hilarious and don't take up the whole movie. Again,the movie is story driven so you won't see alien poo come out ofnowhere and be expected to laugh. Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt are excellent in their roles. I am notreally fond of Bonnie Hunt's TV show, but she is much better here.Both the parents come across as supportive and loving, even ifthey have too much to deal with. Hilary Duff, Piper Perabo, and Tom Welling, who are stars in theirown right, seem a little out of place here but yet still fit. They are notthe whole movie. Perhaps if Hilary's appearance wasn't somanicured?   Ashton Kutcher is not given much screen time, andhis charactar is what he does best -- Kelso. The movie has great songs at every other turn, but holes in the plotaren't filled with song and dance scenes (What A Girl Wants). Itwould make a great soundtrack. The movie features bloopers at the end, which are funny, but notso hysterical as to be funnier than the movie (A View From TheTop) . Cheaper By The Dozen is by far one of the best family movies ever,and maybe even one of the best movies of 2003 (though that couldbe considered a bit of a stretch) It's interesting, creative, and verywell done.

63,byson5186,Somewhat Enjoyable,8,23 June 2015,"I have to say, I can't believe this movie is more than a decade old, almost 12 years old. I'm sure if you watched it, you wouldn't think it looked that old. Yeah, it was made before IPhones came out which are really common devices nowadays. It's hard to imagine living without them now.This movie is a movie that shows Steve Martin as a Dad with 12 kids. In real life, Steve Martin didn't have any children until much later after this movie was made, like a decade after the movie was made. The kids in the movie seem somewhat like normal kids. With all those kids, it's hard to maintain control over his household. It shows something we typically see in a lot of movies of a mom being able to keep control of the kids and household, but a Dad can't. The family in this movie also reminds me of the Heck family from the Middle. I could imagine them being cousins with the Baker family, they'd seem to fit in.This movie is a funny movie, and it shows family life. You'll laugh when you see it. The plot from this movie doesn't seem like a memorable plot. You'll remember it more for showing family life in good times and bad times and seeing Steve as a father figure. He plays his part really well.I still occasionally watch this movie if I'm up for an entertaining movie, as it will keep you entertained. If you're up for a family movie, than this is one to watch. They also came up with a Cheaper By The Dozen 2 and I've seen that movie, but it wasn't that great not really entertaining or worth your time. It just doesn't hold up quite the same as this one does. The 2nd one is more like a family vacation for comedy, and it isn't a family vacation we'd see in films like Grown Ups where that entertains you.I used to really like this movie, especially when it first came out on DVD. I listened to the kids commentary every once in awhile. I used to look at all these IMDb message boards as I remember 10 years ago in 2005, how there were lots of fanfics for this movie and the characters. Some of the fanfics would be horror while others would be just like storytelling. They entertained me. We don't seem to have those fanfics anymore.Well, again I can't believe it's been 12 years since this movie was made. The kids in the movie obviously have aged a lot since the movie was made. Like, they're basically all in their 20s except the older two and younger two. Man, time flies. It's nice to keep memories of earlier times.",Cheaper by the Dozen
64,miken-3,Cute,8,24 January 2005,"After Martin's lackluster Bringing Down the House, this movie was a vast improvement. Martin is highly likable as a small town football coach who is offered the opportunity to move to Chicago to coach a major college football team. This opportunity is too good to pass up and since it is what Martin has wanted his whole life. The bad thing is that his large family, that is used to living the small-town lifestyle is forced to uproot and move to a totally alien environment in a rapid-paced big city. Martin's professional life clashes with his personal life, as his university boss wants him to spend all his waking hours concentrating on football, while his twelve children are all running into problems adjusting to the new environment and constantly need his attention. His problems get multiplied when his wife's career as a writer takes off and she is asked to go on a tour to promote her book, leaving Martin to be in charge of the 12 demanding children.It is highly entertaining seeing how Martin tries to have his football team practice at his house so he can also watch his kids. All of this goes on under the scrutiny of his controlling neighbors, who only have one kid, who they don't allow to do anything fun.There are some really touching moments especially involving Martin's youngest son, who seems to be ignored by everyone else. His best friends are his frogs and the move is devastating to him because he will not be able to bury all his frogs together when they die. It is an almost heartbreaking moment when his other frog dies and he gets on a bus (or was it a train?) by himself to travel back to his old house and bury his frog with his frog's friend.",Cheaper by the Dozen

Within days of arriving, Mrs. Baker's publisher calls telling her that they want to publish her book.

They spoke a rapid-fire lingo of sports announcers, and--before I go on--I say save your money.  I am embarrassed for Steve Martin.  There must be other ways to make a quick buck than churning out stuff like this. Read the book--it's old, but it's much better.",Cheaper by the Dozen

73,CindyH,Great family fun!,8,18 April 2004,"***** USUAL WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS MAY BE INCLUDED *****I must admit that I wasn't too keen on seeing this film. I understood that this had nothing to do with the original. This movie would have scored better had the titled been named something else entirely. After all, it is a different movie so why keep the title the same? I find that a bad decision. I believe the overall IMDb user ratings would be higher had the title been something else. As is it, viewers try to compare it to the original and naturally they scratch their heads over it.However getting past that, I think it was really good. I'd see it again and plan on purchasing the DVD. As a family film I wasn't expecting top notch acting nor superb direction and/or cinematography. It's just a cute and funny film.It yields many morals. I've seen some user comments here pointing out that some of the film contained adult like humor, but this is part of the moral of the story. This is driven home by the statement of the father of the brood who says that this is a G rated family and that's the end of it.I found it quite funny. I really enjoyed the parody of many of today's parents who believe in raising only one or two children, with strict diets and all the typical fad parenting beliefs. It's nice to see that the value of not sweating the small stuff is still out there and that family should be number one before you worry about what everyone else thinks.There are plenty of laughs throughout as well as many touching moments. Forrest Landis, who played little Mark, was just adorable and did an excellent job. He was the scene stealer of the film and it would seem that the majority of the film was centered around him. I found his portion the most touching and even a few tears made their way to the corners of my eyes. Outside of the parents, he was the star.The simply gorgeous Tom Welling was a (quite happily) distracting element. I felt he was quite believable as the big 'angst-ing' brother and he does look VERY good in that white shirt of his.Hillary Duff was her usual self in it. I'm not a Duff fan and feel that 97% of her acting borders on the line of whining and the tradition doesn't end here. However, given the fact that her older brother (Welling) is as handsome it would seem appropriate that the next in line child were just as attractive. Duff fills that bill. The one item I found distinctly incorrect is the repeated point of her taking the hand-me-downs from her older sister, Nora who is in her early twenties. Duff is dressed way too trendy to be wearing hand-me-downs. A less 'today's teen' wardrobe would've really been more appropriate for her.Ashton Kutcher was quite funny as the anti-family boyfriend. Oddly, I knew he looked familiar but didn't recognize that this was Kutcher, probably because I'm no fan of his. I was certainly pleased though with his work here and would have to say that he too was the scene stealer next to Landis. His self loving character was just hysterical. I'm not sure another actor would've been as suitable as him.Bonnie Hunt was as flawless as she always is. It's quite evident that age is catching up to her but I don't think that as a downfall at all. For this film, it's a plus. To raise twelve children is certainly a strain and while she plays a happy loving character, she looks tired and that is realism at it's finest. Off the set, I love Bonnie for not allowing Hollywood to make her feel that plastic surgery is inevitable for everyone.Ditto for Steve Martin. I have to say that I didn't find him very believable as a football coach. He's not the coaching type. I blanched when I realized that's where this was going, but without revealing too much of the story, I had to raise my glass with how it was played out. My initial feeling of his being a coach was apparently right on target and is perhaps the reason why he was chosen for this character to begin with. In any case, Steve is just as funny as he nearly always is and I'm so glad he was in it.The surprise appearance of the much weight reduced Wayne Knight (Seinfeld's Newman) was wonderful. He seems to carry this character of cynicism around with him wherever he goes and it didn't stop here.Finally, the cute pets. I'm still scratching my head wondering why IMDb still refuses to credit animals. They still get paid and are considered actors. In any case, the dog reminded me of Chance, in Homeward Bound and played a good part as well. Many films have a family pet in the background, but most are ignored for the most part and are in very few scenes. Thankfully he isn't in this one. He's around the majority of the time and even has his own scenes as well.The same goes for Beans the frog. Beans actually had a very important part and his acting was quite above the average frog standard. ;-)All in all I took off one star for the title. Again, it should've carried a different one. I took off one and a half stars for leaving the story about Charlie and football unfinished, as well as the story of all the kids and their peer relationships unfinished. There was no tying up the loose ends regarding the changes these kids went through at school, away from home.

All of the actors and actresses were really good, especially since they were either a kid or they had to work with kids. I was laughing a lot when I saw this movie.

The one thing I did not get was how the large family survived chaos for 22 years, then melted down when Martin gets his ""dream job."" Martin and Hunt certainly had the skills to manage the new level of chaos, so I was left with the feeling that there was no real story here unless the writer artificially supports the premise that the simple life is happier than the complex life. Since the rich ARE happier than the poor, if occasionally disfunctional like Paris Hilton, it might have been more realistic to go with the Hilary Duff character and let the children adjust to their new, higher status rather than make themselves miserable by rebelling against the new life. Kids are pretty selfish, but I don't think they are stupid enough to sabotage success and material wealth.",Cheaper by the Dozen

(I suspect that the other person was an employee of the theater complex, relaxing or goofing off between sweeping assignments. He left 20 minutes before the end.) The only reason I stayed was that our young adult grandson seemed to be enjoying the picture.I didn't expect Steve Martin to be Clifton Webb, but the gang of selfish brats these people perpetrated on the world are beyond comprehension. Aside from an understandable reluctance to move to a new environment, their mean-spirited attempts to sabotage their parents' careers are so revolting that I could barely stomach them. I was embarrassed to find myself laughing at the 3 or 4 truly funny incidents, when all the rest was so wretched.Among the interminable string of commercials and promos that preceded the feature was a bit designed to discourage digital bootlegging of movie and music files. This well-done little production packed more interest and entertainment into about 90 seconds than the feature managed in 98 minutes.I wish there were a Users' Rating below 1.

Steve Martin has a wonderful wife, Bonnie Hunt, who has written about her wonderful family of 14 and how well they all get along. Her husband has the perfect job as a football coach. When he gets a job for much more money at a bigger school, they expect him to spend more time at work and therefor less time at home with his children. At the same time, his wife is doing a book-signing tour to promote her book, taking her away from her family. They both fall for the evil idea that money will bring them happiness that their large posterity has not. He lies to her, telling her things are fine without her. When she comes home to shoot ""Oprah"" in her own home and finds the house is a shambles and the kids have no discipline, she is willing to break up their marriage because he didn't tell her that she needed to be home. She obviously wanted to be doing her book tour; he was just trying to give her what she wanted. Her irrational anger at him, willing to break up the marriage because he was being so supportive of her career, really made me not like her. The children were mostly being very unlikeable while she was gone as well. Steve Martin's stupidity in telling his wife things were all right when they weren't left me with no one to like in this movie.

I have not seen the original film, but I doubt that this new one is better. This film is too infantile, with Steve Martin doing more trivialities than his own children in the film. Tom Baker and his wife Kate have twelve children, of whom they are very proud. Tom is a football trainer and his boss offers him to go to live with his family to an enormous house in a big city to be the trainer of a famous football team. At the beginning, all the things go well, but later the children begin to miss their old house. The protagonists of this film are Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt as Tom and Kate and Piper Perabo, Tom Welling and Hilary Duff as the three eldest children: Nora, Charlie and Lorraine. It is a film for all the family, and little children will love it. But even so, if you want to see it, there you. I hated this one and I'm not going to see more than once.

Nor do any of them look like either of their space-alien parents.  Dad gets his ""dream job"" as head football coach of his alma-mater and moves from your average farmhouse in Wisconsin (located somewhere in Canada) into a multi-million dollar mansion of a Chicago (also in Canada) suburb in a parallel universe.  On this planet neighbor children don't look remotely like their parents either so it must be normal to mate with gorillas, donkeys, and farm animals in general.  The everyday life shown to those duped into paying to watch this rubbish is shown.  Such enormously ""funny"" lines as (paraphrasing): ""I just Turtle-waxed my Chrysler LeBaron MXV Convertible"", ""Can you pass me the Kellogg's Special K cereal?"", the Bekins moving van, ""I don't have enough Kodak film for my Canon LRBB 35-mm camera"" and so forth wanted to make me puke.  Instead, I puked into the popcorn of the couple sitting next to me.  But the absolute best part of this waste of Kodak XCVUYMX Wide-Screen Type R movie film are the two cameo appearances of the Motorola RSX boom microphone.  Apparently the editors missed that part.

It had a decent plot with minor holes, and the acting was for the most part decent too.I can see why some parts made people laugh, but I did not even as much as smile through out the entire duration of the film. However, the part that really irritates me, is that there was so much potential to make it funny. There were so many parts where I thought of a dozen ways I could've improved the scene to make it funnier. Also, you are never told exactly how a college/highschool football coach and an aspiring author can support 12 kids in a mini mansion. Steve Martin has had some hilariously funny movies in the past, yet he is not funny AT ALL in this. Now I absolutely hate Ashton Kutcher, and he even had more funny lines than Steve Martin in this.

Oh my. It could've been so funny, witty, and poignant. Instead, the screenwriter didn't have a clue as to what's humorous or realistic, in a large family. I have never seen a woman, who has bore twelve children, have the figure Bonnie Hunt possesses. Without a maid, a nanny, and/or household help, there is no way she'd be able to write a bestseller. She'd be washing, folding, sorting, changing sheets, shopping for groceries, cleaning the kitchen, bathrooms, etc.  Not graciously sitting at the Christmas table looking cool as a cucumber. Anyone from a large family knows you MUST get the eldest to manage the younger tots. Why was Steve Martin preparing dinner, and Bonnie Hunt setting the table, when they have ample help from at least ten children? It just didn't set right with us, and why all this wasn't caught when in production, is beyond our wildest assumptions. A real pity. Steve must really need the bucks.

Steve Martin is a star but, when one considers that he doesn't actually have any children of his own, the very fact that he accepted this part gives cause for head-scratching.

Even though it was not a heavy drama it was still a delightful film.  I am a big fan of Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt.  It's not a bad movie despite what a lot of detractors say-the script is appealing and spunky.  This is a typical, feel-good and predictable movie. Regardless; nice entertainment and good acting. Not exactly for audiences that want deep meaning behind a film, but for those who like quality, cute kids and 12 different subplots, it is a must see! I admit that even Duff was quite cute in her role,but most of the time she was incredibly bubbly and gooey.  Her role was small, it was really the little kids who stole the show.  The movie is funny, enjoyable, and interesting.  A good film. By no means is this film intellectually taxing, or complicatedly structured, but then, it doesn't pretend to be. it's a simple family comedy which features all of the expected codes and conventions for the genre. I can honestly see the appeal of the talented Bonnie Hunt, she was the best part of this film, she was quite believable as the mother.  Steve Martin had occasional funny moments which slipped into the film, but were quickly overrun by silliness and cliche. It did have minor plot holes, and the kids were kind of paired off.  This was a cute movie, nothing more or nothing less.  The main reason I truly enjoyed this film, aside from the fact that Bonnie Hunt, a comedian that is actually funny and talented was in it, was that how adorable and talented the kids were.  Sometimes this movie was misguided and sugary, it's still enjoyable and sweet.  It was touching, the actors and actresses did well, and the dialogue was humorous.  At no point I was wishing it would end.   It really makes you think about life and how it works.  I would recommend it to anybody who likes a feel-good movie.  The kids and parents have excellent chemistry.  I saw it with a few of my friends and they absolutely adored it! A bonus for all you girls out there:  Tom Welling and Ashton Kutcher are both very attractive.  With big-name stars like Ashton Kutcher and Hilary Duff, it's sure to get your teenage daughter or son to watch.  It's about Tom and Kate Baker, who are married and have 12 children.  After the they've created a well-oiled machine of family, the Tom Baker gets a job offer he can't refuse, but it requires them to move out of there rural Illinois to the Chicago in the suburbs.  Kate finds a publisher for her book, based on her life and she must go to New York, leaving Tom alone with twelve kids. He can't balance the fine line between family life and work life.  All in all, an enjoyable easy-going film, well worth the hour and a half it takes to watch. I would give Cheaper by the Dozen a well-deserved 7/10!  For it pleased me so much!

91,jfwhelan,"Deeply Flawed  The message seems to be: ""Give up; accept second best""",4,21 January 2005,"I have resisted watching this film for a long time; I remember cringing when watching Steve Martin in the remake of 'Father of the Bride' and did not wish to see an actor, I enjoy, suffering so again. Well this also was not a patch on the original, but that said there was nothing wrong with Steve Martin's performance; he does well with the material as indeed do all the performers. In fact this is well directed, and a fine film technically: it is just that the script is unbelievably awful (warning there may be slight spoilers):- This is a film about family values, yet it has been written by people who clearly don't understand family values. There is no family spirit; no feeling that, with the exception of the parents, any of the family members cares about anyone but themselves. Of course children can be selfish; of course families have off-days; but at the end of it all they pull together, that's what it means to be part of a family. This family didn't pull together; it was self destructive to an absurd degree. I come from a big family I have a big family and one thing I know, as does anyone who is or has been part of a big family, is that big families need discipline. When you have more children than you have hands, you have to know that your children will do what they are told when it matters: this is fundamental it is simple survival. The major calamities, the scenes of complete mayhem, these at least rang true, but where was the aftermath: the parents seemed to accept it as there lot to be the butt of their children's nasty pranks. I don't mean to be overtly moral, but for this film to have worked it needed to have a moral backbone, there needed to be a demonstrable upside to helping each other and a realisation that when hurt was done, that this was bad: unfortunately this was missing even to the point that we, the audience, were meant to think it funny that one of the children was nicknamed Fed Ex to signify that he did not fit in. The first time it was sort of funny, but when it kept happening and was not challenged it became unpleasant. At least here there was a consequence, but there was no acceptance of guilt on the part of the main perpetrator and there was no evident remorse.If you watch this film, I am sure there are odd moments of high comedy that will appeal, but, unfortunately, that is probably all. There is no pathos, no feel-good emotional payoff. The ending is deeply disappointing. The parents give up. All they needed was for the children to help for two weeks, but that was too much for this loveless family, so the parents give up their dreams, and accept the easy course. What sort of lesson is this? If threatened with difficulty, if the right thing to do is too hard  Give up! This film does not have a nice message. I find it deeply worrying that there are so many favourable reviews. On reading some of these I am relieved to find that their authors, clearly, took other things from this film; who knows, they may be right, perhaps I have misinterpreted the content.

Admit it, seeing Ashton Kutcherthe ""model-slash-actor"" (who has some great lines mocking hisreal-life career) being attacked by dogs because his underwearhave been soaked in ground beef is appealing.  Don't you wishyou'd thought up that one for your hated childhood enemy?  I, too,dislike Hilary Duff, especially when she's attempting to act, butshe's only in a few scenes, so why let it ruin the movie?  Finally,this movie isn't even a true remake of the original, it's more of asame-concept-different-plot thing.

95,dennsylvania,Terrible!,2,7 March 2006,"What a terrible film. Not enjoyable at all. It is depressing way more often than funny. The funny moments added together would equal about a minute of screen time. The rest of the film was a total waste. The characters are so annoying, that it is impossible to feel for them, even in the moments intended to be emotional. A household of undisciplined brats, and two parents who barely get along, are too easily dominated by their children, and who allow their children to control their career decisions, is not entertainment, it is annoyance at best. It is at times too realistic to the toughness of two career families to be enjoyable. People watch films to escape reality, not be painfully reminded of it. At other times, it is too absurd to be taken seriously. There is a happy medium between realism and surrealism. This film never achieves it. The story is so clichéd and predictable. Every single thing that happens on screen, you knew would happen before it did. If you are looking for a humorous film, or a touching film, or even an entertaining film, look elsewhere, this isn't it. If you are looking for an instructional manual on how not to raise children, then maybe this is for you.",Cheaper by the Dozen

I didn't even intend to go and see it. I went in the theatre, cuz i had nothing else to do and i finally saw it (two weeks after it was released).It was very good surprise for me. I realized that it is very good and very funny family movie. My opinion about it just turned at 180 degrees in 20 minutes. Then i saw it gain next day, and again, and again... As much as i watched it i liked it more.Great performances by all kids especially by Forrest Landis.",Cheaper by the Dozen
97,joits,Not good at all...,4,18 July 2004,"This movie is a mess.  It prevents all these unrealistic problems that the kids face in the movie.  And it just wasn't funny... just  annoying.  The movie started out with potential, but with too many characters and too many problems the resolution was too quick.  We never got to see how they dealt with their problems.  Half the movie was spent showing them struggling with change, and then in a minute or two, they overcome it.  Just not enough time to properly give the characters any depth.... As far as the performances... Steve Martin is always good.  Bonnie Hunt was okay, but I prefer it when she plays the hard nosed sarcastic type.  Tom Welling... I guess its a decent start to a career outside of Smallville. Aston Kutcher, the only way he gets a $100 million hit, to ride on someone else's coat tails.  Hilary Duff... she didn't have to do much except show anguish a few times.  Piper Peraboo... not bad, and again, not enough time for her character.  The rest of the little kids, they were pretty good actually.Still... I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.",Cheaper by the Dozen

It is packed with comedy that will blow the family away and the best thing about it is it's rated 'G'. So it's great for a family party. The movie is great and everyone acted well. The worst actor would have to be 'Bonnie Hunt' she played the mom, and didn't do really well as her. The best actor would have had to be 'Steve Martin' and 'Hilary Duff' as they put a great effort into the movie. The storyline and plot was fantastic but the humour needed a bit more improvement, they needed more talking comedy not hurting comedy. The movie is great and it is good to see with your mates or whomever it may concern",Cheaper by the Dozen

OK, take a TRUE STORY which also happens to be an interesting piece of American history as well. Then take the (extremely well made) movie version from 1950, throw in the (also well done) sequel in as well. Chuck them all down the toilet and mix in stupid jokes, and you get this dreck.

102,rockorbe2002,you call this a family film??,4,30 July 2009,"well, this movie starts out not bad. we have a giant family. well, not exactly octomom or jon & kate, but this is a massive 12-member family. seems a peaceful family with a hardworking dad and loving and nurturing mom. although you already notice something wrong with this picture. a big family and none of the kids do any chores whatsoever. from here the movie takes a plunge. the dad takes his dream job of coaching division 1 football, not only he does it for himself, but for his family's well being. the message doesn't sit well with the kids who do ANYTHING to avoid it. notice that looks like the movie portrays the father as selfish although its the kids who don't give a damn, always whining, not obeying rules, etc. etc. and then the mom decides to pursue her dream of publishing a book. not gonna happen, with a bunch of brats and a father who cannot fend for himself. in the end, the kids get their way. in conclusion, this movie, far from giving ""family values"" portrays a interesting point: kids get what they want, especially if there's 12 of them. they're immature, misbehaved, bratty, whiny. among them, the older jock son who bitches about not wanting what he wants. dude, you're old enough, get a job you little prick! hilary duff, as always annoying. the parental figures, well, they were more like submissive figures. surprisingly, the best performance went to ashton kutcher, who i find usually annoying but this time his character was funny. so i see why people recommend this for the family, since it seems like this is how they raise their own families.",Cheaper by the Dozen
103,calsinic,Is this supposed to turn people off from having kids?,3,10 January 2005,"While funny at times this movie is nothing but one sad story about how a bunch of one man's kids make his life hectic and crush his dream. The movie might have been better had the end seemed more like something he didn't feel right doing as opposed to a choice made because his kids were never going to let up. Ashton Kutcher surprisingly funny playing a self absorbed idiot, of course that was because he wasn't really acting all that much. This movie really makes you not like the kids, except for the eldest 3 who don't behave like undisciplined monsters. Shame because between Steve Martin & Bonnie Hunt this should have been a much funnier movie. The two really didn't even have a chance to display the chemistry as they are away for each other for a large bulk of the movie.

105,conkeestador,Steve Martin on autopilot...,1,3 June 2004,"This movie is, first of all, complete crap. It is truly a sign of the Apocalypse when Ashton Kutcher (in an uncredited role) is funnier than Steve Martin.I wasn't really expecting much but the movie was eye-poppingly bad. The story is about a couple who have brought 12 children into the world and then decided to pursue personal goals. The script is poorly developed and does not make you feel for any of the characters. One of Steve Martin's lines - ""Twelve kids later and we still got the heat."" It really made me nauseous. I should have walked out at that point but I didn't want to embarrass my own kids.No production values. The boom microphone drops into the shot no less than six times throughout the movie.It was unintentionally funny in parts and completely unfunny in the supposed ""comedic"" bits. It was so bad it was not even entertaining in a bad way.$20 and 2 hours I can never get back. It was.... I can't be bothered with this anymore.

It has the usual feel good quality to it and  it was very entertaining, something which too many films nowadays are not. The gag with the meat soaked underwear  was hilarious. what I also liked about this family film was that it wasn´t trying to promote a line of toys or video games.  If I was to criticize this film then I would say that 12 kids can come up with a lot more mischief than was portrayed and Bonniie Hunt did not look like she gave birth to 12. Quite simply this is a family film like the kind Disney used to produce in the 60´s and 70´s sure it´s a bit mushy and promotes traditional family values. I say there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.",Cheaper by the Dozen

Forced situations to make the audience laugh that don't make sense. Why did the writer just give all the kids Smart Alec lines? She can't sleep so she calls for more pillows then appears to go to sleep before the pillows get there? Was that bad editing? It seems this was just a movie to place a bunch of already well known people in another movie to add to their resume? Sequel was worse career promotion and told no real story.,Cheaper by the Dozen
108,SpudV,Non-sense,3,29 December 2003,"Check your believability sensors at the door, because Hollywood has cranked out another stretch of the imagination, and this is not even sci-fi!1.  Steve Martin is not believable as a coach or a dad of a large family. He was much better in Parenthood, so maybe he was a victim of the scriptwriters.  I kept waiting for him to turn to the camera and say:  I'm not really a coach or dad, I just play one in this movie.2.  The mom spends years writing a book but then can't wait a few months, after football season, to go on her book tour.3.  The dad waits for several days before calling for help, and then can't find anybody in the yellow pages.  He works on the campus of a big university and can't find part time help for the kids?  Give me a break.4.  The large families I know rely heavily on the older kids as surrogate parents to help with the everyday problems.  The two numbskull teenagers in this film are wrapped up in their own little worlds and stay in their rooms.5.  A coach of a small division III school would have less time for family as compared to a coach of a major program, who would have a much larger staff of assistants to delegate responsibilities.6.  A head coach would not be running drills, either at the practice field or the back yard, or give detailed chalk talk to the players.  That's what the assistant coaches are for.There's more, but that should do for now.  Despite the logic gaps and non-sense, there were some amusing scenes in the film, particularly before the family move.  With that big of a family they did not have to send the mom off for a good story.  They could have come up with plenty of entertainment from the conflicts present when a family of 13 lives under the same roof.",Cheaper by the Dozen
109,ctr4etrnty,Baker's Dozen Enjoyable Family Fare,7,7 April 2004,"OK, I admit it  I liked Cheaper By The Dozen. Didn't LOVE it, but I liked it. Which will place me squarely in the critical minority, I'm sure. But, here's the thing. I'm first, and foremost, a family man. And, from a parental perspective, I can tell you that films I can feel comfortable sitting down and watching with my kids are few and far between. Cheaper By The Dozen is one of those films, a non-threatening, light-hearted piece of fluff that leaves you feeling.pretty good.When the film opens, Tom (Steve Martin) & Kate (Bonnie Hunt) Baker are happily raising their brood of 12 children (including Tom Welling & Hilary Duff) in a quaint country home filled with the sounds of organized chaos. When Tom, a football coach, lands his dream job coaching his alma mater, the family picks up and moves to the city where the kids have a hard time adjusting to their new life and cope by creating plenty of mischief. Shortly after arriving in their new home, Kate learns that her recently completed book has been published and she reluctantly embarks on a two-week book tour leaving Tom to run things at home. With his growing responsibilities at work and a small army of rebellious children to contend with at home, Tom confronts the issues of balancing work and family with results that are often very humorous.If all of this sounds very formulaic it is. There is little in the way of surprises here  much of the plot is recycled from any one of a dozen other family films (this film is, in fact, based on a 1950 film of the same title although this film bears little resemblance to the Clifton Webb/Jeanne Crain version). But it is loaded with nice little comedic moments, such as a frog that disrupts the family breakfast, a running gag involving a chandelier (featuring a fit and trim Wayne Knight), Tom trying to cook dinner while dealing with a steady flow of child-related issues, and a gag involving the family dog, meat-soaked underwear, and Ashton Kutcher (I gotta admire the guy for looking straight-faced into the camera while delivering the line `My face is what gets me jobs. I know I'm not a good actor, it's the face that gets the work!'). Under the comedic surface lie themes of family unity, cooperation, priorities, and unconditional love.As for the performances, they're ok. Martin (Bringing Down The House, Father of the Bride) and Hunt (Beethoven, Bug's Life) work nicely off of one another and have a pretty decent on-screen chemistry. Duff (The Lizzie Maguire Movie, Agent Cody Banks) doesn't have to stretch too far playing the family's teen fashion diva and Welling (TV's Smallville) gets plenty of face time as the oldest brother. Piper Perabo (Coyote Ugly) is the oldest child who has recently left the nest to move in with her actor boyfriend. With an ensemble cast this large, it is difficult for anyone in the cast to stand out performance wise, but each gets a moment during the film to reveal a bit of his or her personality.Overall, Cheaper By The Dozen is innocent and inoffensive family fare that the kids will probably love and parents will find rather enjoyable.",Cheaper by the Dozen

In my opinion, you should stick with the original. Cheaper by the Dozen has an all-star cast that ruins it completely. Steve Martin is trying to be funny as Tom Baker but it's just not working. He's lost his touch and spoils the movie completely. For Me, I bought this when it first came out, and i now wish i kept the receipt because it is a stupid movie that goes on and is really unfunny and predictable. Unfortunatelty, the sequel was made as well, as thats not any better. Ashton Kutcher, Piper Pirebo, Hillary Duff, Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt are way to many stars as i said and it gets ruined by this.",Cheaper by the Dozen

That is my main objection. I loved the book and the movie with Clifton Webb. I was looking forward to a new version of the real story. I was very disappointed that the entire story was changed. This movie was not based on the book any more than The Sound of Music was based on the story of the Jackson family.They could have added one more child ( a baby girl) and called it ""Bakers Dozen"" and not said it was based on the book because it absolutely was not.I don't care for movies about smart mouth kids who can't behave.",Cheaper by the Dozen

He's over 25 for heavens sake. The only thing the movie did for me was making me hate the kids in it. They are so spoiled, and are misbehaving so bad, it's not even funny anymore  just improbable and borderline Sci-fi. Piper Perabo is beautiful as always and Hilary Duff's really cute. Most of the people are acting good or ok, but with a script like this, it's impossible to save.

When Mark runs away and shares an emotional moment with his father and they are both crying is also very touching. Ashton Kutcher is great and really funny. There wasn't enough of him in this film.

119,cmon3590,Cheaper not to traumatize yourself,1,17 December 2004,"I've always liked Steve Martin but after seeing Cheaper by the Dozen I felt almost traumatized and now, just hearing the title of the movie makes me shiver. I didn't go to the cinema with high expectations by any means, but I at least expected the movie to be 'watchable', so to speak. It wasn't! My six-year-old-son, like me, has a keen interest in comedy and we both love some of Martin's previous movies like 'The Jerk'. But fifteen minutes into 'Cheaper' and he turned to me and said 'Mum, this movie's really bad! Can we go now?' He was five at the time! Even when considered against the milieu of the 'bad movie' genre, among such horrors as The Bodyguard, Far and Away and Grease 2, for example, Cheaper stands out for it's brain-numbing banality. Though I've never seen the original movie based on the book, I can only assume it must have been better than the 2003 remake, otherwise why would anyone in their right mind have bothered remaking it? Two seemingly brain dead, ultra yuppie parents have the most boringly scripted conversations in movie history about whether or not the father (Martin) should pursue a football career and whether the mother (can't remember the actresses name and don't want to) should go off somewhere and become an author. Oh dear! While Martin seems to put a lot of energy into a whole lot of nothing (not really his fault I guess; nobody could have stood up against such an atrocious script and likewise directing) the actress who plays 'mom' seems totally detached from the film and consequently portrays a character that is almost frighteningly dull. The dozen 'madcap' kids who, incidentally and insultingly to the intelligence, bear no familial resemblance to each other whatsoever, are all over the place both literally and in terms of character portrayal. The script is diffuse and inconsistent and the attempts at sub-plotting would be laughable if the whole movie wasn't so utterly painful.This is corporate Hollywood milking a cash-cow - sucking us in by putting Martin in the film but then torturing us with what was surely thrown together in half the normal amount of film-making time at half the cost. I feel angry that I paid the money to see it and advise anyone else who is considering it not to put themselves through it; save yourself the price of the movie ticket AND the therapy bill!My vote: Minus 18 out of 100",Cheaper by the Dozen

Although not faithful to the original, this movie keeps the spirit of the original in that it shows family as the most important thing while still laughing at the humor of everyday life.The supporting cast is excellent! All of the actors playing the Baker kids deliver excellent performances. Most notable are Hilary Duff (The Lizzie McGuire Show) and Tom Welling (Smallville). Hilary is great as always and gets to show that she has true potential as a dramatic actress. I'm not a big fan of Ashton Kutcher, but I must admit that he delivers an absolutely hilarious uncredited supporting part.This movie is a treat for any family. Most parents will find it acceptable for their kids. The only really offensive portion is some ""thematic elements"" involving the oldest 20-something daughter's living with a guy.

Of course, this can't be good and the kids will do everything in their power to end this.See mom. See mom get a fabulous book deal, pursue a career of her own (temporarily, it was ONLY A 2 WEEK BOOK TOUR!!!), get a shot at being on Oprah, and really live out her dreams. Of course, this can't be good and the kids will do everything in their power to end this.Every chance possible, the parents bend over backward to help the kids out. The dad even has his football team practice at his house, cuts press conferences short, blows off his Athletic Director, works his everliving tail off...all for nothing. The kids still rebel, sneak out of the house, abuse the eldest daughter's boyfriend, and consistently start fights, wreak havoc, and do NOTHING to help out in any way.The ""dozen"" kids consist actually ""nine"" kids. Of the remaining three, one lives COMPLETELY ON HER OWN and two are in high school. The eldest son does nothing but brood and sulk and the eldest ""in house"" daughter (Hillary Duff) is barely on screen long enough to contribute. Why can't they help out at least once? To sum up the movie, dad gives up dream job, mom quits book tour early and blows the Oprah shot, and at the end of the movie, and the kids are STILL at the house they hate, in the neighborhood they hate, going to the schools they hate...but they all seem happier somehow. *Sigh* When will Hollywood make good movies again?And the moral is........what's good for the parents must be stopped by the kids at any cost.",Cheaper by the Dozen

127,francesco1221@hotmail.com,missed opportunities,5,3 December 2003,"I saw the movie tonight and liked it, but maybe being the youngest of ten kids blinded  me to some of the film's shortcomings. The movie did seem pretty over-the-top in portraying the family chaos. But it's a  comedy, and so I was willing to endure that, and some poor writing, and some missed  opportunities, and some unnecessary Planned-Parenthood style propaganda in the first  five minutes. I am making reference to the father's vasectomy after #12. How does this contribute to  the story? A grade-school-aged girl sitting next to me turned to her mom after that  scene and said, ""Twelve is a lot""... to which her mom replied, ""Too many."" So it seems  that the scene actually undercut the message, which isn't a great idea five minutes into  the film. Maybe it foreshadows (or initiates?) the selfishness that makes things unravel,  but if so, where is the reversal (pun intended) at the end? Also, the film gave in to the perennial temptation to make the children talk like adults  much of the time. Is this supposed to be funny? Or is it simply the incapacity of the  writers to recreate the speech of young people with any authenticity? Some things I liked about the movie: 1) no ""heavy"", other than our achievement-based culture 2) Bonnie Hunt 3) some skilled editing that created humor where the writing could not 4) Bonnie Hunt Any creation of the mass media that can show me (vs. tell me) that the Gospel of Life is a  happy one has my endorsement.

131,JCHathaway-1,"By modern Hollywood Standards, it was pretty good",10,27 February 2005,"I can understand the criticisms that many have offered, but by modern movie standards, it's pretty good. First of all, it's not really a remake at all. Just a movie that uses the same title. And someone said the original inspired _The Brady Bunch_; it did not: that was ""Yours, Mine and Ours"" with Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda. Anyway, as others have noted, the main flaw in this movie is the lack of order in the household, but that is not entirely unrealistic. Family size has nothing to do with discipline or organization. I've known big families that operate on a strict regimen of chores and scheduling, and I've known families with two kids that are far more chaotic than these fictional Bakers. I thought it *was* a good message of discipline that the parents govern primarily with love--including the co-sleeping so derided by one reviewer here. The core message--that family must come before career--is true regardless of the number of children a couple has. The suggestion that the kids did not know the meaning of ""grounded"" could have several meanings--my wife and I took it to mean that the parents never had a situation that required such measures previously. We were offended by the vasectomy reference in the beginning, given the movie's premise, and a thought that ""well, maybe they're not Catholic"" was countered by the rosary reference later. As for the main plot line, I did not understand why two weeks at home with the kids would have *that* much effect on a college football coach's career? I mean, I realize college football is intense, but come on. How many games get played in two weeks? And wouldn't there be much more time to plan and schedule a book tour than ""Come on, we're sending you off right now?"" TV appearances can take months to schedule. Likewise, the mother's book tour crisis/homecoming carried the obvious question of how someone looks setting a side the family to push a book on children and family--a question of hypocrisy one might raise of several authors. As for the reviewers who've challenged Bonnie Hunt's ""figure"", I have seen plenty of women with large families who remain thin--usually from the amount of work they do. I saw a mother of 8 in her early thirties on EWTN a couple years ago, and she looked like a model right out of high school. The movie itself was enjoyable, and carried a good message, but tried to carry too many good messages, and the narrative would have been shored up better with a consistent theme (and a little more thought to the situations).",Cheaper by the Dozen

There are a lot of 'sweet moments', and it does not fail to make it a comedy-family film.I loved how the movie had heart.

There are 12 kids instead of one kid. You can buy 12 times as much food but it doesn't cost you 12 times as much money so it totally makes sense to have twelve kids. If you have like seven kids and you meet somebody you like and they have five kids you should marry them even if you don't like them just because over all you will be pooling your money and resources together and saving valuable money.

142,StrangerMouse,Not the best family film,5,4 June 2004,"I watched this film at a birthday party the other night. I must tell you that when i saw the trailers for this film about half a year age, I was quite disappointed with the trailers and thought it would be best if my $10 stayed in my wallet.CONTAINS SPOILERS -Tom and Kate Baker live in small town Illinois, with their twelve children. Tom is offered a dream job at a football team but the only thing is they have to make a big move to the big city. Whilst they have moved to the city, Kate's long awaited book is being published and she must go on a two week book tour, leaving Tom juggling the football team and the kids.The cast in this movie were well chosen and you couldn't have asked for a better father(Steve Martin) and mother (Bonnie Hunt)One of the problems of this movie was that the focus of the movie apart from Tom's parenting and coaching, were the nine kids (i've taken out perabo, welling and duff) playing practical jokes and misbehaving a lot. Some of the pranks were funny but it got to a time where I thought 'did the writer run out of ideas and throw in a few more misbehaving child moments'This movie really needed more goods. The writing was fairly average, and the acting was also fairly average. Kudos to Ashton Kutcher's character! He was the funniest person in the film, and he did have funny lines although what the kids did to ashton was very cruel which made me hate the kids a lot.I notice a major blooper in this movie. I understood that Piper Perabo lived in Ashton's apartment, so why did everyone say that they still have 12 kids in the household? In fact, as Kate Baker said, she took time of her first full time job to take care of the house. This must mean that she wasn't part of the household at the time, which suggests that there are 11 kids in the household. Another thing I noticed was when Steve Martin was calling the baby sitters, he mention he had 12 kids, which is true. But didn't he need a baby sitter for 9 kids only? I mean Perabo, Welling and, well considering age, Duff didn't need the babysitter so the correct way he should have answered the phone was 9 kids.The movie had the plot but it did not have the story. The movie had the suitable characters, but in some cases did not have the actors. Jacob Smith was an excellent addition to the movie.I strongly advise you to not buy this film, if you have not seen the film, unless it's a cheap price.

I had contempt for his letting the satanic brood he created make his life miserable.  A classic self-inflicted wound. Personally, I found the movie nerve wracking to watch.

The comedy is very fun and exciting as the children like to plot against their eldest sister's (Perabo) boyfriend Hank (Kutcher) and his ""money making face"".Hank is a very funny character and he brightens up this fun-filled comedy with his witty comments and his selfish attitude.In the end the family realise that having money doesn't necessarily make you happier.This movie was good and would have been even better if Hank was in it more as he brightens this light - hearted comedy.",Cheaper by the Dozen

Aside from the parallel situations of having twelve kids, the film and the book are nothing alike. Football coach? The dad was an efficiency expert, not a football coach (of course, no one would want to see a film about an efficiency expert). Even the names are different: ""Tom Baker"" instead of ""Frank Gilbreth."" The excellence of the book came from the humorous situations that their father put them in: having all their tonsils removed at once, teaching them all to type at the same time, playing records while they brushed their teeth so that they would learn foreign languages. Steve Martin's Cheaper by the Dozen is another Hollywood kid film: once you've seen it, you want your $7 back, since you were tricked into believing (from the trailer) that this film was any good.

But maybe that is because the plot is so bad. After all, Steve Martin, one of my favorite actors/comedians, should be given a non-serious part with some absolutely ridiculous (yet hilarious)lines. Instead, he plays an aspiring football coach. Couple this with a lousy support cast (Bonnie Hunt can do better, and Hillary Duff has got to be one of the worst actresses I have EVER seen) and a very unsatisfying ending, and you've got one bad movie.

I read this book years ago, when I was in grade school, and enjoyed it thoroughly.  The book was warm, funny and endearing. However, beyond the presence of a family with twelve children, there was absolutely no similarity between this movie and the book.  None!  I doubt the scriptwriter even read the book; he was probably just told to write a movie about a family with 12 kids with lots of shallow slapstick humor and a simpleminded conflict-resolution cycle.It's not that this film is unusually bad compared to any other dime-a-dozen formula movie cranked out by Hollywood for the bored and easily-amused.  I just find it offensive that they have sullied the title of a classic book by associating it with this bland pablum; the credits even make the audacious claim that the movie was based on the book.  A director and writer who had not long since sold their souls might have revitalized ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" into a modern classic, but instead the artless director has turned an ""All Creatures Great and Small"" into a ""Scooby Doo"" or ""Weekend at Bernie's"" production.  Shame!If you're even considering this movie, I encourage you to get the original 1950 production instead.  I haven't seen it, and I can't say whether it's any good, but at least the original author of the book seems to have been associated with the production so it's bound to bear some resemblance.

This is another example of Hollywierds attempt to portray Men as bumbling and incompetent Stooges and Women as the Strong heroic member of the household. Tolerating misbehaving children without discipline and hoping that they grow in to normal well adjusted Adults is a Hollywierd fantasy. Women were portrayed poorly in the past, in many films it's true though never has any sort of injustice been remedied by taking turns at it, nor will it ever.The plot of this totally 'NEW' story which has the same name as the 1950 movie is weak. The acting is just ok. The ""NEW"" story is the same as most of the modern California renditions of Typical Family life in the late and now early 21st Century.

162,musicians-1,It remains a bad movie,1,10 April 2004,"I think this Movie is so bad that my conscience will not allow me to recommend, even as a prank, taking small children to see it. I could not recommend taking older children either and only might if only to let them experience the difference between what is really bad in Hollywierd and what is really good, using this Movie as the really BAD example! Children should be shown really good wholesome Family Movies first (pre-1980 Disney and pre-1970 Hollywood) and then be exposed to a LOT more GOOD Movies and only after that and only if they fall victim to the ads, which typically show deleted scenes or the ONLY funny or exciting parts of a Movie.They may be able to draw a more realistic distinction between what is BAD and what is GOOD in entertainment. It should be explained in careful detail that these types of movies in NO WAY are depictions or examples of REAL LIFE. They should draw NO ideas in which to rule or pattern their own live s from. Children are so very influenced by this kind of media. Example, after watching a ""kung Fu"" movie, children run and jump and kick and chop at things and imitate what they have just seen. Children that are not given an opportunity to see much in the way of Movie entertainment that depicts wholesome real family values will come away with an attitude that they may be able to draw some real similarities between garbage of this movie's caliber and that of real life. They may draw such conclusions as ""I think that any family that has trouble getting along will see this movie will definitely realize that there are other families out there with way more problems that they have"". Children may not realize fully that there is NOTHING whatsoever which may be drawn from this ""MOVIE"" and might attempt, in their childish ways through their childish minds to compared this Hollywierdness to real life. Children are naturally drawn to anything with lots of colors and fast movement on the screen. Just look who is babysitting so many children today, a Purple Dinosaur or different colored critters with televisions where their stomachs should be. Mute these shows and you will see what an added influence even the music and background noises makes as well. Adults who write critiques posing as Children are the worst though. They try to convince you and others that, even children know you can take away a real or positive LIFE experience from such a horrible movie as this. REAL Children may read those comments and as a result may experience some sort of nagging impulse to see for themselves. If we are honest and up front with our children and if we don't post true comments and continue pretending to be children then REAL children may never know if a movie is or is not a waste of time and money till it is too late and they have wasted 2 hours of their precious lives and 6 bucks of their hard earned money.Summation: This is a truly horrible Movie in so many different ways that I hate to really try to list them all. A few thoughts I can summarize of my opinion were formed through living life and actually watching many, many good and bad movies in my life and are as follows: Creating this from it's first thought to it's being pressed on to it's last DVD, robbed reality as we know it of so much time and energy and recourses. From it's first thought the makers stole from existence, something really else which could have been very significant or something else which could have been occurring during that period of time. Because of the creation of this Garbage some other funny or significant thing in our Universe was being ignored or wasted away without the chance of coming into being! So now you can see that making bad movies is not just a waste of time and money it is actually creating a bad influence on our children, while at the same time it tears a great unhealable hole in the very fabric of our Universe and thus our very existence!I think Nostrodamus wrote a quatrain about this and it goes something like this. `In the land of the Oranges, early in the years between 2000 and 2010 there will come an abomination so great that a great rift in space and time will occur causing the Universe to contort and collapse in on itself. None will be spared and everything will be destroyed because of the creation of this chelladriod or digitmal images'. I see now that he meant Celluloid because of the Film used in creating Movies or he meant Digital because of the Digital imaging of motion pictures. That guy was so ahead of his time.So far we are still here. Thank our lucky stars, but Please Hollywierd, for the love of all that we hold sacred stop this madness before it's too late and you finally create the one and actual menace spoken of so long ago by NOSTRADAMAS! Ahhhhhhhhhhhrrrgggghhhhhhhhh, trails off to silence and then nothingness (if you can imagine it)",Cheaper by the Dozen

167,2_Singles,Charming Family Movie,7,3 September 2005,"I was very excited for this movie to come out and I went to see it right on Christmas day. I was not disappointed. It's a fun-filled, family movie with a great cast, a cute storyline, and likable characters.When Tom, the head of the Baker clan, gets offered his dream job at his alma mater, he, his wife, Kate, and their 12 children relocate to Evanston, Illinois. While Tom and Kate are excited about the move, the new job, and the raise that comes along with it, the kids are less than enthused. This, combined with Kate's absence while promoting her book, and Tom constantly busy with work, sends the family into chaos. The kids get into fights at school, 2 of them run off, and any order the family once had, is gone. By the end of the movie, the family finds the missing member, makes amends, and go on with their new, happier lives.Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt make a fun couple. They have great on screen chemistry and both gave great performances. Piper Perabo plays the oldest daughter, Nora. Nora lives in an apartment with her boyfriend, Hank, played by Ashton Kutcher. Kutcher's ability to poke fun at himself makes his character the funniest one in the movie. Tom Welling (""Smallville"") makes his movie debut as the oldest son, the moody teenager Charlie. He does well in this role, proving that he's not just a (very) pretty face. Hilary Duff plays Lorraine, the fashion/beauty obsessed one in the family. I, personally, could've done without her in this movie. She and her acting have no appeal to me. The younger kids were played by mostly unknown kid actors. It was refreshing to see a bunch of new faces. They all played their roles wonderfully. The performance that stood out the most to me was Forrest Landis's as the misfit of the family, Mark ""FedEx"" Baker. All the children were enjoyable and with 12 kids, there's always something going on.Look out for the Shenks (the Bakers' next door neighbors) and the electrician (played by Wayne Knight) who all add some fun to the movie.The gag reel at the end was a nice surprise and finished the movie off well.Overall, a great family movie. Funny, yet clean. Clean, yet different.Best part of the movie: Tom Welling as Charlie. He gave a great performance and he isn't bad on the eyes. ;) Worst part: Hilary Duff. Again, she/her acting don't appeal to me at all.",Cheaper by the Dozen

I think the only similarities are the title, and the fact that they have 12 kids.  The movie does the book a huge injustice.Expectations aside, the movie had some plot holes, but I would have appreciated this kind of film if I was a parent looking for a family film. It reminded me of the old Disney classics my family rented when I was growing up.  I'm sure that kids would love the mess and destruction that seemed to be the focal point of the movie.  They tried to cram too many sub-plots into it when they could have focused strictly on the family dynamics and had a great movie.I'm just glad I rented it and didn't spend $$ at the theater.",Cheaper by the Dozen

172,nick_garidis,Surely the best advertisement for contraception ever devised.,1,19 August 2007,"'Cheaper by the Dozen' is a shallow, slapstick family comedy that teaches kids the moral 'if you are a big enough pain in the backside to your parents you'll get your own way'.All the child stock characters for ghastly family films are here- the fashion-obsessed teen girl and her admiring suck-up, the nerdy boy who doesn't fit in, the mastermind, and other assorted and VERY annoying children. Hilary Duff only seems to be able to play one sort of character, the shallow teenage diva that she portrayed in Lizzie McGuire and A Cinderella Story. And the worst thing is, this is a remake of a 1950's film (based on the life of a real family, the Gilbreths) that at least retained some dignity. Admittedly, I've never yet found an American film where any of the children did not make me want to gouge my eyes out, and they do say that you should never work with children, but there have got to be thousands of them better at acting than this bunch.This film is about an American Football coach, his book-writing wife and their twelve children. When the father, Tom Baker (Steve Martin) is offered his dream job in Chicago he jumps at the chance, but the kids are reluctant to leave and fight every step of the way. Soon after their arrival at their new house, the mother, Kate (Hunt) gets her book published and is invited on a tour to promote it. This leaves Tom to look after his twelve kids whilst still coaching his team. Of course, havoc ensues when the children rebel in more and more inappropriate ways, including soaking their eldest sister's boyfriend's underwear in meat, so that well, let's just say it involves a dog. Needless to say, this is only relative havoc, considering their normal behaviour includes rollerblading on the top floor of the house (which, by the way, results in Steve Martin hanging from a chandelier What will they think of next?). Another 'funny' moment to look out for is the breakfast scene in which the family manages to fit more pratfalls and flying food than I would have thought possible. Of course, everyone's already seen it in the trailers. One part of this scene the trailers didn't show, though, was the extremely tasteless gag of one child falling over in another's vomit.There is one blatant (I mean even more blatant than the rest) gap in the plot, though- the father is an American Football coach for youth teams; why on earth should he know anything about disciplining children? Craig Titley certainly knows how to write a script that will draw in the kids, and he also knows that, being kids, all they need is a good bit of slapstick and any plot holes will smooth themselves out. I honestly don't blame Titley for writing this; it's making him a whole lot of money. I don't doubt that he could write a respectable script, but if I was him, I wouldn't be able to sleep at night having written this monstrosity.These days you can't really expect more from a 'family' movie, and yes, this is great for five-year-olds (not to mention their parents who get a brief respite from bringing them up), but this is a film that really isn't going anywhere. It has a vaguely moral and vastly schmaltzy 'happily-ever-after' ending which was evident from the end of the opening credits and is basically just a piece of pap like all the other ones Hollywood churns out to generate revenue.Ashton Kutcher, playing the Bakers' eldest daughter's boyfriend, was genuinely funny, playing a low-level actor who knows that his face, not his ability to act, is the money-maker (a wonderfully scintillating self-parody). However, this oasis of comedy is vastly outweighed by the barren desert of farce that is the rest of the movie.Basically, Cheaper by the Dozen is a remake of the 1950 version which has had all the genuine warmth surgically removed and replaced with prosthetic 'comedy' (to use the word loosely).",Cheaper by the Dozen

The young children are really entertaining with their pranks and comments, especially the youngest twins who are so adorable. The movie was heartwarming and hilarious but had some cliches, but that was to be expected. The outtakes at the end are worth staying for. Ashton Kutcher, as always, was hot and funny as Hank, the eldest daughter's (Piper Perabo) actor/model boyfriend. For those ""Punk'd"" fans, Dax Shepard is in the movie as one of Oprah's crew members. There wasn't much of a plot and some parts weren't realistic, but on the whole it is a great movie for the whole family.",Cheaper by the Dozen

It is a waste of time with any movie to compare it to its other versions or to analyze young actors. If you allow yourself to enjoy the movie, you will enjoy the movie. It is very funny, although not Steve Martin's best, and the actors playing the kids are at least satisfactory and some of them are pretty good.Liliana Mumy is as adorable as in The Santa Clause 2, and the two little twins are really cute. I also fell in love with Forrest Landis. I automatically felt a bond with his character and did throughout the movie.

176,Fegerfous,Not associated with the original !!!!!!!!,3,30 June 2005,"Please understand that this is not a remake of the original. It simply shares the name and has a large number of children. I advise you to go to www.google.com and search for ""Lillian Gilbreth"" You'll be amazed at who she really was.The original film is based on the real-life Gilbreth family and it was all about how organized and loving this huge family was, despite the occasional disorder that any family can have. Frank and Lillian Gilbreth were world-famous engineers who were the pioneers of motion study and efficiency in the workplace. They went into companies and made them more efficient by eliminating wasted motion and processes. Three inventions by the Gilbreths are the trash can with the pedal, shelves in refrigerators and the surgical process where a surgeon requests a tool and the assistant hands it to them. Lillian had a PhD and 21 honorary degrees and was a professor at Purdue, Rutgers and other universities. She was an adviser to 5 US Presidents and a close personal friend of President and Mrs. Herbert Hoover. She is the most famous female engineer in history and was the first woman ever elected to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. In 1984 she was honored by being put on a 40-cent postage stamp. She and Frank have a permanent exhibit in The Smithsonian.The original book and movie play up the fact that the Gilbreth parents ran their family as they ran their businesses: orderly and efficiently. It is a true story with a small bit of embellishment, considering it was written by two of the actual children in the book.This 2003 version with Steve Martin is simply about a loud chaotic family and has nothing to do with the original. Their name in the movie is Baker and they are supposedly ancestors of the Gilbreths. There is no connection other than that.Therefore, enjoy this humorous film but please do not associate it with the original story of ""Cheaper by the Dozen"".",Cheaper by the Dozen

178,dianesellers,This is definitely NOT the Cosby's ...,5,22 April 2005,"This is an enjoyable film, but it's not really about the chaos of raising 12 children. It's really about what happens when you let a bunch of kids run amok in a home with no real discipline. The only time Dad grounds them, one of the kids, probably 11 or so years old, actually asks him, ""what's 'grounded?'"" If they don't yet know by that age, grounding them is probably a total waste of your time. And whatever happened to doing what your parents say just because they are the parents, they know what's best, you're still a minor and you're still living in their home. And these factors are MOST important when times get really tough, like the situations in this film. I'm sure kids who saw this film learned a few pointers about how to get their way by running their parents lives and wrecking a family.

I'm not even certain why it has a PG rating, since it was mild compared to some other PG films I have seen. One of the themes is how much more important it is for families to stay together than to achieve fame or wealth, which is a big departure from the usual narcissistic ""me"" generation films of today.

Moving trucks (hey, nice plug for Bekins there) on Lake Shore Drive are illegal. The Amtrak train morphing into a Metra train. I think they used the Milwaukee Amtrak station. The ""Chicago"" airport... well, that wasn't O'Hare or Midway.As others have noted, the family's implosion is pretty improbable, given the environment that they moved into, with a high six to seven figure salary.

198,yellobaseballgrl,Obsession is Unhealthy (but not for me),10,25 April 2004,"My name is Angela and I just turned 13 today. I just wanted to let whoever is reading this know, that Cheaper By The Dozen is the best movie I have ever seen. I have seen it twice in theaters and 10 times on DVD in the past 1 1/2 weeks. I don't know what it is about this movie, but I can watch it over and over and never get bored. I know the names of everyone in the movie, I almost have the whole script memorized, and it just makes me feel so happy to watch it. They say obesession is unhealthy, but since I've been watching this movie, it gives me motivation and overall has made me happier than my usual dullness. I have to go now, I have to watch Cheaper By The Dozen for the thirteenth time. Cyaz",Cheaper by the Dozen
199,anna-192,Anyone who doesn't appreciate this movie has ME to answer to!,8,2 July 2004,"I've heard a lot of bad stuff about this film, but I just want to say that this film ROCKS!! Okay, so I'm probably a different age to the other reviewers, and I'm British so I might have different taste to you guys, but if a young teenager who doesn't usually like ""All American, family Films"" can love this film, anyone can!!! I personally think that Alyson (however you spell it!) and Jacob are the best of the young actors, and despite the crude puke and dog biting jokes, I think that they've all done really well! So stop biting their heads off, cos i LOVE this film and any1 who doesn't appreciate it has ME to answer to! Love AnnaP.s. Just for a freaky note, my youngest brother REALLY looks like the twins! It's spooky! Why am I telling you this?!?",Cheaper by the Dozen
200,TeenMichelle,A Must See!,10,13 July 2004,"I just loved Cheaper by the Dozen! When I saw it in the theaters I was one of those people laughing so loud that anyone in the theater would have been able to hear me. Not only is it a great comedy, it made me cry too. I love movies that give the viewer more than one emotion! I now own the movie on DVD and the commentaries during the film are really cool to listen to. I def. recommend this move. It has TONS of great actors in it and the ""Baker kids"" are so cute. I wish them all the best of luck in their future careers. Not only did they have great known starts in it (like Steve Martin, Bonnie Hunt, Hillary Duff, and Ashton Kutcher), but they opened up the doorways for new kid stars as well. Seven of the Baker Kids had never been in a movie or TV show before, giving it a fresh look. I can't say who my favorite ""Baker kid"" in it was because they were all so good but some of my favorites were Loraine (Hillary Duff), Sarah (Alyson Stoner), and Mark (Forrest Landis). Go out and see it!",Cheaper by the Dozen
201,brty85,Great Movie!,10,6 January 2005,I love this movie! I really like the casting and directing of this movie. Of course I am 19 but I love kid movies it's almost all that I watch. This movie really is funny. Some people might say that it is very cheesy but I like that kind of movie. I love Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt together because they are great together in the movie. I suggest this movie to anyone in the world even if you think that it is cheesy watch it one more time and see what u think after that. You won't be sorry if you do. In my experience the movie is very touching and might be able to touch you. Please watch this movie it's very very good.,Cheaper by the Dozen
202,mrowland-1,I just LOVED this movie!!,10,10 August 2005,"I truly enjoyed this movie! I've seen it over and over again. :0) I taped it off HBO many months ago, but I still wanted to rent the DVD from Blockbuster to see the ""extras"". :) I loved the director's commentary, but wish they had included much more in the way of outtakes and 'behind the scenes/making of..' info. :) I just loved the kids in this movie, but the kids' commentary was a waste of time. Just a bunch of silliness, really. :) The Kinsman twins were absolutely darling!! They remind me of our middle son, who looks a lot like them. Those twins are just precious, CUTE little boys. They make me want to have identical twins! But we have four children now, and we're done! :0) :0) Can't wait to see the sequel to the movie! I'm going on opening night in our city, for sure.In my opinion, I don't think the movie is suitable for children younger than 13. We certainly didn't let our children watch it. But I loved it to pieces!! :)",Cheaper by the Dozen

204,lanfier,Large family dynamics,3,10 April 2005,"I come from a family with 11 children, the authors of the screenplay did not capture the dynamics of a large family at all. The only hint there is of the way it really is in a large family is Hilary Duff's line @ the train station about how she might want to kill her sis sometimes but would kill for her ALL times. That is truth. The rest is just a movie script written for comedic value. I agree the movie, situations, the character flaws and values are quite funny, but the movie really, really missed the boat on large family dynamics. The older children would not have left the Father stranded when dealing with the younger children, and they would have given attitude at a later time, rather than add to the problem they (the older children)were having to deal with regarding the younger children. The older children would have gone to the parent in the evening or early morning when they could have a moment alone with their parent to discuss (or argue) what their problem was at that time.",Cheaper by the Dozen
205,vitorrita,A good movie to think about having kids,8,15 June 2005,"The movie is about a couple which has 12 kids, who lives in the countryside, the father is a football coach, the mother a writer. they were a happy family... until the they that the father got an opportunity to coach the team that he always dreamed about, but he would have to go to the city for that. Most of the kids didn't enjoyed this idea... still, they moved, and since then, the chaos in the family begins.Honestly, I was hopping to watch a comedy movie, what in fact I haven't. I say that cause I didn't have that fun watching it, although I enjoyed the movie's idea.It made me think about the responsibility of having children, not only economic speaking, but about how much time would you spend with them, the things you were going to teach them, how seriously would you listen what they have to say and their opinions, and specially, how many children can you handle...",Cheaper by the Dozen
206,camy-ra,A good comedy,9,20 June 2005,"In my opinion ""Cheaper by the dozen"" is a very good movie. Not very creative...but still good!!!This film is perfect to watch with your friends or family when you just want to relax and don't want to reflect at all...you just have to laugh and have fun. It's a movie to the whole family...without restrictions. But...if you only like movies that make you think or dramatics stories with a very involving plot, ""Cheaper by the dozen"" is not for you. The cast is wonderful too!!! Steve Martin is fantastic(he is always fantastic). Bonnie Hunt is very good too!! And the ""teens"" actors, like Hilary Duff, Tom Welling and Ashtons Kutcher are so good...This film is really very good and funny...If you like this kind of movie you have to watch!!!",Cheaper by the Dozen
207,dantld,It maybe sound very fondly but this movie look like my dream.,10,11 July 2005,"It maybe sound very fondly but this movie look like my dream. But really i can not allow to self to have the dozen I've only two. For me this movie not only comedy and family cinema but it show me something unrealized the really love BIG FAMILY. I can not known how many families could decide to have so many children but such movies MAYBE push to somebody. to this. This movie looks like a tale but any way I believe that such family exists. This movie show one real problem that can appear in any family - time, time that we can to deliver to our children and time that so needed to our business. With my children i make sure that this really a Big problem. We need to find more time for children and also we need time for our works (like unrealized projects), and I think that this movie good example for all parents that only one significant thing exists - it is a children. I can say tha same about movie ""Daddy day care""",Cheaper by the Dozen
208,cervantex,Best Movie Ever,10,28 July 2005,"This is the best movie I have ever seen. My favourite actor/actresses are Jacob Smith (wow we were born in the same year), Blake Woodruff, Morgan York, Alyson Stoner and Liliana Mumy. I cannot wait till they release Cheaper By The Dozen 2 as I think it will be just as great as Cheaper By The Dozen if not better. This film actually inspired me to talk like an American and it makes me wish that I was one of the brothers in the movie or get to meet Steve Martin, Bonnie Hunt and all the Baker Kids. I bought the film last Thursday and it arrived to me on Saturday two days later and I have already watched it about 12 (Dozen) times and I am not going to get tired of it. Also I love watching the movie and listening to the Baker kids Commentaries and I just want to say Well Done to everyone in the movie especially the Baker kids whose acting was extremely good.",Cheaper by the Dozen
209,bootsjink,Kevin Schmidt,10,21 September 2005,"You know I have seen Kevin Schmidt that played Henry in this movie and that kid is good. He is so real. I bet he gets along with everyone on the set and has a good time with all those brothers and sisters. I liked him because he seemed like a carry brother. I was glad to see Mr. Warren of Warren Theaters of Whichta, KS put his name in lights when the movie came to Wichita. That must have made Kevin feel good that his home town people care so much. I have seen Kevin in other things that he has done and I think the kid will do great. He sure is a hottie. I am looking forward to seeing Cheaper By The Dozen #2. I know it will make a lot of kids happy. It is just a family movie. The whole family can set down together and watch and enjoy it. Thanks so much for making this movie.",Cheaper by the Dozen
210,The_Braziliant,The Best Family Movie!!!,10,16 January 2006,"I really loved this movie and sure maybe it is not the same as the book is but I thought the movie was excellent.The kids were great too, it was like they have acted for a long time the really brought the entertainment to the character, but all this would not have been done without the director Shawn Levy. He must be one heck of a director with all that patience, all I say right now is he deserves a 10 in his performance it was enthusiastic and an all around good movie. You don't have to have a big family to view this movie!!!!! I would give it a 10 and would recommend if you haven't seen the movie in theater then buy it on DVD right away. It will blow you right out of your seat!!!!!!!!!!",Cheaper by the Dozen
211,jasmineforest,12 Bratty Bakers,4,10 October 2021,"I grew up with both my parents being in medical field, so as a kid I always wanted to be more home, to spend more time with us, essentially everything that the 12 children of Baker family wanted. So, one would expect me to be happy with the movie... that they got what they wanted. Well, I'm not.As much as I wanted those things, there is also the understanding that my parents are people too and they deserve to have dreams. And to follow them. The 12 children of Baker family were such selfish little brats, even the older ones.And what's worse is that at the end, they didn't go back to Midland, the children eventually settled in Chicago, and the mom became a writer and everything worked out fine... So was only the dad's dream something extra??? Come on! And honestly, if anyone had to back down from their dreams it would've made sense for the mom to hold off publishing her book for a while. Because free college?? They just gonna pass on that when they have 12 children? That's just a chance you are not going to miss.Anyhow, I can't say I didn't enjoy the movie, it was kind of fun but the take away lesson and the ending? I hated it.",Cheaper by the Dozen
