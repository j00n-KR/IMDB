0,TheLittleSongbird,Anarchic purge,6,8 August 2018,"Am another person who didn't care at all for 'The Purge' from 2013. It wasn't completely unwatchable with a couple of reasonable performances and decent production values but was so tension and suspense-free and full of irritating characters, illogical character behaviours, a dull pace, a cheesy script and tired clichés.Had seen and heard numerous times people saying that 'The Purge: Anarchy' was a much better film. Will admit that due to disliking 'The Purge' so much, part of me was very unsure as to whether to watch 'The Purge: Anarchy' and very nearly didn't watch it. To be fair though, decided to watch it and found it not to be a waste of time at all, it is a second film that stands well on its own and doesn't try to be more of the same and instead be different from the predecessor. Am in complete agreement with those saying that this is the far superior film, while thinking that it was still flawed and not too great.'The Purge: Anarchy' has a lot of good things. The story execution is much better this time round, it's more eventful, is tighter paced, is intriguing and has some creepy atmosphere and suspense. The acting is also better, with a formidable Frank Grillo leading the cast with aplomb.Less irritating characters here too, generally the characters are easier to relate to and are not as shallow, their behaviour also makes more sense and induces less face palms. There are unsettling moments here, some fun ones and some intriguing ones. It's assuredly directed and the slick and gritty visual look remains, its effort to be larger in scale in terms of ideas and narrative and have more going on is laudable.However, 'The Purge: Anarchy' is still heavily flawed. The dialogue is still enough to make one cringe and just sounds so fatigued, stilted and without any imagination. The social commentary and rich vs poor aspects are dealt with in a heavy-handed way and the effects are shoddy and do look fake.Character development is very flimsy and 'The Purge: Anarchy' still has a few characters that frustrate (especially the annoying Cali, with Zoe Soul giving the only ""bad"" performance), not much imaginative or surprising and the clichés every bit as tired. There are some parts that feel like they're stretched out too far, the ending doesn't finish the film with a bang as much as one would hope.Reading those criticisms, one would think that 'The Purge: Anarchy' is a bad film. Unlike 'The Purge', it is not. It's problematic and is not a great film, but overall it's decent enough and has a good deal in its favour with things that were bad previously corrected. 6/10 Bethany Cox",The Purge - Anarchy
1,Leofwine_draca,Better than its predecessor,6,31 January 2017,"The good thing about THE PURGE: ANARCHY is that it's a step up in terms of quality from its predecessor; the first film was just another home invasion thriller, one quite well made but let down by its own predictability. ANARCHY is still predictable, but the chase/journey narrative structure means that it's a faster-paced production as a whole, one that never becomes boring.The film's protagonist is played by Frank Grillo, a guy who never impressed me in support in the past but who does a fine job as a tough guy here. He reminded me a lot of The Punisher in terms of his dark appearance and tough-guy presence. The supporting cast are less interesting, and some of the female characters are still annoyingly weak and given to screaming at every little thing.Still, the journey through dark and violent streets is an often exciting one and there's a wealth of gritty action to enjoy. Often the action is a little too CGI-enhanced for my liking, but at least the film never slows down, building to an appropriately thrilling climax. Watch out for Michael Kenneth Williams in another weird cameo. ANARCHY manages to be creepy enough in the early scenes and exciting enough in the later ones to be an effective Hollywood thriller.",The Purge - Anarchy
2,SnoopyStyle,actors are smaller but the scale is bigger,6,8 March 2015,It's 2023 hours before the Purge. Waitress Eva Sanchez plans to spend the Purge hiding in her working class apartment with her daughter Cali and father Papa Rico. He leaves a message telling them that he is sick and sold himself to be Purged by a rich family. Then a paramilitary force takes over their building. Meanwhile couple Shane and Liz are trapped when a masked gang sabotage their car leaving them stranded right before the purge. The two groups are rescued by LAPD sergeant Leo Barnes who is on a mission to Purge of his own.This one takes the franchise out into the streets. The expanded scope improves it in many respects. The actors are smaller but the scale is bigger. Cali keeps talking loudly which is very annoying. She's the annoying brat character. I would be a lot happier if she shuts up. I like some of the turns. There is a social commentary component that is somewhat interesting. The morality question is raised but it's all very murky. There is still a lot of room for improvements.,The Purge - Anarchy
3,Prismark10,The people under the stairs,5,13 June 2015,"The Purge: Anarchy is set in 2023. A future America where crime rates have lowered and unemployment is low but economic prosperity does not seem to be any better.However the reason for all this because a new government has introduced the Purge. An annual bloodfest where for 12 hours people kill or be killed. Murder is legal and the victims tend to be from the poorest of society. It can also be a good opportunity to settle old scores.This film is part Warriors, Hunger Games and The most dangerous game plot mash up.Three set of people end up together on Purge night. One is Eva and Cali, a waitress and her daughter who have been attacked in their apartment. There is Shane and Liz a couple on the brink of separation whose car has been tampered with and breaks down on the highway. Finally there is Leo, a tough cop who is out on Purge night armed with something on his mind.Leo ends up having to protect this group from the rampaging mob but there seems to be more to the Purge this time and there is also an anarchist group who sees the Purge as an attempt at social cleansing by the rich and the powerful and have made noises to take action this year.The film has an underlying political theme. The rich sees the Purge as almost a bloodsport, the government sees this as an opportunity to get rid of the dregs of society.I guess the film of a murderous rampage should be more violent and nasty than shown here. Frank Grillo actually makes for a good 'heroic' type here. Its not an original film but for what it is, the film is rather entertaining and the sub text is rather good if heavy handed.",The Purge - Anarchy
4,claudio_carvalho,Better and Better than the First Movie,7,19 December 2014,"In 2023, the Purge Night is about to start for the next 12 hours. A stranger (Frank Grillo) leaves home and drives his car with a mysterious purpose. Meanwhile, the couple Liz (Kiele Sanchez) and Shane (Zach Gilford) are provoked by a masked man. They drive in the highway and their car unexpectedly stops. Soon they find that it was sabotaged by the group of masked man that are waiting for the beginning of the Purge. When it begins, they are hunted down by the masked man. Meanwhile, Eva (Carmen Ejogo) and her daughter Cali (Zoë Soul) find that Eva's father sold himself to a wealthy family since he is a burden to Eva and Cali sine he is sick. Out of the blue, an army invades their building and breaks into their apartment. They are taken to the leader but the stranger decides to save them and kills the soldiers. Meanwhile Liz and Shane hide inside the stranger's car and he decides to help them to survive. However his car is hit by the bullets and he needs another car for his mission. Eva tells that her friend Tanya (Justina Machado) lives a few blocks away and he would borrow her car. Soon the stranger gets involved by the four survivors and helps them during the dangerous night.""The Purge: Anarchy"" is better and better than the first movie since it is an action film in the style of ""Warriors"", ""Escape from New York"" and ""Hostel"". The premise is still stupid, but there is an ironic criticism to the America Society together with lots of action. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): ""Uma Noite de Crime: Anarquia"" (""One Night of Crime: Anarchy"")",The Purge - Anarchy
5,nogodnomasters,CHANGE ONLY COMES WHEN THEIR BLOOD IS SHED,8,30 November 2018,"The first ""Purge"" film was a glorified home break-in movie. This feature takes us to the streets and the meat of the purge. The film runs with a plot and 2 subplots that come together. The plot centers on a struggling African American lower middle class family who just want to be left alone. There is a couple whose car has broken down in the city and a cop who is out seeking vengeance.We get to see the psychotics in the street and how the rich pay to ceremonially kill poor people. The political aspects of the film, i.e. ""class warfare"" that was touched on in the first film becomes a powerful theme in this one. (Hint: The word Anarchy is in the title.)The characters were rather dull in a film that begs for quirky individuals. Does Magnolia have to make this film to get it right?Makes for a decent Redbox rental. ""Stay Safe.""Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity. Strong class warfare message.",The Purge - Anarchy
6,kosmasp,Legacy,7,8 October 2014,"Purge Legacy would've been a good title. Maybe part 3 can be called like that, if they haven't already decided on that. Whatever the case, the idea behind the purge is fitting to exploit in more than one way. You don't have to revisit anyone from the previous entry. You could actually make it happen in another state, not to mention that this happens once a year, so infinite sequels ahead ... hopefully not, but we do know, as long as they're successful.On the other hand, as long as they are at least as good as this sequel, why should we care? There are clichés thrown in (not a few I might add), but the movie still does work. You get a few guys you might have seen on different TV shows (our main male character to name one or a very high-profile The Wire actor). This time the world does expand and we have more than one location/family/person to look at. Also we do get a bit more background of the whole ""Purge"" campaign and what else is behind it (predictable and obvious, but a nice touch).",The Purge - Anarchy
7,jboothmillard,The Purge: Anarchy,5,7 November 2020,"The first Purge film worked well as a home invasion movie and set up the scary concept that would almost inevitably lead to a sequel, and that came the following year, to extend the story. Basically, in 2017, the 28th amendment of the U.S. Constitution is approved, establishing one night a year, 7pm March 21 to 7am March 22, ""The Purge"", in which all crime, including murder, theft, arson and rape is permitted, and all police, fire, and medical emergency services are unavailable for 12 hours. The only rules of the Purge are that high level government officials are not to be disturbed, and high grade weapons, such as explosives, grenades, bazookas, rocket launchers and so on, are forbidden. Those who violate these rules will be publicly executed by hanging. The Purge has resulted in crime and unemployment rates plummeting and a stronger economy. It is intended for catharsis (releasing rage), but in reality, it is a method of artificial population control, as unemployed and poor people are usually the main targets. In 2023, American citizens are preparing for the sixth annual Purge. There are also those who protest against the Purge, including a resistance group led by Carmelo Johns (Michael Kenneth Williams) and his partner Dante Bishop (Edwin Hodge), the Stranger from the first film. They successfully hijack government feeds to denounce the New Founding Fathers and their actions. In Los Angeles, working-class waitress Eva Sanchez (Carmen Ejogo), her daughter Cali (Zoë Soul) and Eva's terminally ill father Rico (John Beasley) are preparing to barricade themselves into their apartment. As the Purge alarm sounds, Rico has slipped out and left a note for his family, he has sold himself as a Purge offering in exchange for $100,000 to be paid to Eva and Cali; they are distraught by this. Estranged married couple Shane (Zach Gilford) and Liz (Kiele Sanchez) are driving through the city, when their car breaks down, not long before the Purge is due to begin. Meanwhile, an off-duty Los Angeles Police Department sergeant, Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo), plots to kill Warren Grass (Brandon Keener), who whilst drink driving killed his son, and was acquitted on legal technicalities. Despite pleas from his ex-wife Janice (Chad Morgan) to abandon his plans, Barnes drives out into the streets with an armoured car and several weapons, posing as a vigilante. The Purge commences; Shane and Liz try to find a safe hiding place, and Eva and Cali are attacked by their lustful and insulted superintendent Diego (Bruce Almighty's Noel Gugliemi). The women are saved when Diego is gunned down by a paramilitary platoon, who take them to their leader Big Daddy (Jack Conley). Leo passes and rescues the women after killing the troops and wounding Big Daddy. Then they find Shane and Liz hiding in Leo's car. Big Daddy fires at them and damages the car, forcing the group to run. As they navigate the hostile streets, they find evidence that the anti-Purge group are gaining the upper hand against the Purgers. They take guns from an abandoned truck and head to the subways, only to find a pyrotechnic Purging gang that has invaded the tunnel. Shane is wounded, but the group manages to escape after he and Liz destroy the gang's vehicle and blow the propane tank, killing the entire gang. The group returns to the streets, but Eva unknowingly signals a traffic camera to identify them to paramilitary troops who pick up where they are heading. The group reach the apartment of Eva's co-worker Tanya (Final Destination 2's Justina Machado), but there is no car. Tanya's family takes them in, offering dinner and medicine. However, Tanya's sister Lorraine (Roberta Valderrama) proceeds to murder her sister for sleeping with her husband. The group leaves the family to their fate, only to be captured by the masked gang who ambushed Shane and Liz earlier. The gang reveals they do not want to kill them, but to sell them off at an auction, where upper-class Purgers can bid on them for human hunting. The group are taken to a theatre, but Leo subdues and kills a Purger, taking his weapon and night-vision glasses, using the devices to overpower and kill several other attackers. During the chaos, Shane is shot and killed by security forces, and the anti-Purge group enter the compound to kill the security forces and remaining Purgers. Liz chooses to stay with the resistance fighters to retaliate against Shane's murderers, while Leo, Eva, and Cali leave. The three carjack the head Purger, holding him at gunpoint, to drive away. They stop at the home of Warren Grass, five minutes before the end of the Purge. Leo tells the story of his son's death, and ventures into the house despite Eva and Cali's pleas, threatening Warren and his wife. Later, Leo exits the house covered in blood, only to be shot by Big Daddy, who reveal that too few of the lower class are being eliminated during the Purge, which was the original intentions of the New Found Father when the Purge was conceived. Just as Big Daddy is about to kill Leo, Warren appears and kills Big Daddy with a single shot from a handgun, revealing that Leo chose to forgive and spare him. Big Daddy's squad appears while Eva, Cali, and Warren prepare to defend themselves. But the siren blare to signal the end of the Purge, and Warren drives Eva, Cali, and Leo to the hospital as news and police helicopters fly over the city. Also starring Castulo Guerra as Barney, Get Out's LaKeith Stanfield as Young Ghoul Face, and Niko Nicotera as Roddy. This sequel definitely makes the most of being on the outside this time, the political and ethical issues come into play again, the survival of the fittest premise is much more brutal, expect to see a good few things blowing up and bloody kills, it is not that scary, but it is a tense and exciting enough dystopian action horror thriller. Worth watching!",The Purge - Anarchy
8,Woodyanders,Surviving purge night ain't gonna be easy,8,9 June 2021,"Two couples must depend on the hard-bitten Sergeant (ably played to the two-fisted hilt by Frank Grillo) when they find themselves out on the streets on purge night.Writer/director James DeMonaco keeps the riveting story hurtling along at a breathless brisk pace, generates a tremendous amount of nerve-wracking tension, maintains an appropriately tough'n'gritty tone throughout, and stages the thrilling action with rip-roaring aplomb. Moreover, DeMonaco's barbed script takes some nice digs at the decadent rich as well as offers several touching moments of genuine humanity amid all the expected brutal violence and carnage.The solid acting by the capable cast keeps this movie humming: Carmen Ejogo as the sweet Eva, Zach Gilford as decent dude Shane, Kiele Sanchez as Zach's fed-up wife Liz, Zoe Soul as feisty teen Cali, Justina Machado as wild party girl Tanya, Jack Conley as the ruthless Big Daddy, John Beasley as the ailing Papa Rico, Noel Gugliemi as the vicious Diego, and Michael J. Williams as angry revolutionary Carmelo. The assorted purge gangs with their freaky masks and deadly weapons are truly terrifying. An on the money movie.",The Purge - Anarchy

10,BA_Harrison,Anarchy in the U.S.A.,8,23 November 2014,"Here's a little tip for you should The Purge ever become a reality: if you somehow find yourself trapped outside once the s**t hits the fan, don't run around like a headless chicken. Find a really good hiding place and remain there for the night! If necessary, pull up a man-hole cover, climb in and hunker down. What's a little sewage compared to being brutally killed? If The Purge: Anarchy's estranged couple Shane and Liz (Zach Gilford and Kiele Sanchez) had done just that then they might have saved themselves a whole heap of bother. Instead, they do the running thing. And find themselves hunted for the rest of the film. Luckily, they eventually choose to seek refuge in the back seat of a car belonging to tough vigilante Sergeant (Frank Grillo), who takes time out from seeking retribution for the death of his son to protect the frightened couple, along with mother and daughter Eva and Cali (Carmen Ejogo and Zoë Soul), whom he saves from a gun-toting gang of killers.OK, so the idea behind The Purge movies may seem a little far-fetched and logic might take a back seat for the duration (this is a Michael Bay production, after all), but I have enjoyed both films equally and would happily watch a third. Writer/director James DeMonaco uses this sequel to expand on his original concept, showing us exactly what goes on outside while the majority of citizens barricade their doors and windows to sit out the annual event. The result is a tense, action packed, and satisfyingly brutal flick with a neat political slant—part The Warriors, part Death Wish, Part Hostel—in which our unfortunate protagonists must risk their lives to cross town to safety, while government-sanctioned death squads roam the streets in trucks targeting the poverty stricken, and the wealthy pay handsomely to partake in organised hunts, with humans as their prey.",The Purge - Anarchy
11,Coventry,"Oh Say, can you see by the dawn's early light, all the innocent people we purged!",6,28 April 2018,"With ""The Purge"" in 2013, writer/director James DeMonaco introduced one of the most original and disturbingly realistic premises for a dystopian Sci-Fi/thriller flick in many years. However, for some inexplicable reason, DeMonaco took all the great potential and wasted it on making yet another mundane and run-of-the-mill slasher/vigilante thriller. Literally everyone could see that the concept of ""The Purge"" (all types of crime are legalized during a 12-hour period across the USA in a not-so-distant future) offers endless possibilities, and apparently DeMonaco realized it too in the meantime, since the first numberless sequel is better, more disturbing and a lot more varied in terms of purging types & participants. Whereas in the first film, only one wealthy family got targeted by a violent gang in their heavily secured house, there are various storylines in ""Anarchy"". Here we see how the purge is used as an excuse to extract personal vengeance, how rich families literally buy poor people to feast their murder lusts upon, how family feuds are resolved, how the government organizes a secretive sort of mass-cleansing and how street gangs (with awesome masks) chase and round up victims for pretentious snobs. That last storyline reminded me of one of the oldest cult premises in cinema history, and a personal favorite classic of mine, namely ""The Most Dangerous Game"". There's still a lot of efficient satire and social criticism in DeMonaco's script, notably regarding America's culture of violence and the pro-weapon attitude. Contrary to most horror films and thrillers nowadays, ""The Purge: Anarchy"" has a cast full of amiable and realistic characters, and the performances (Frank Grillo, Zoë Soul, Kiele Sanchez...) are more than adequate.",The Purge - Anarchy

14,Theo Robertson,A Sequel That Reaches Its Full Potential . Great Action Thriller,8,29 March 2015,"I almost didn't bother with this sequel . The first movie was close but no cigar down to rather lazy and ill thought plotting and since this movie was also written and directed by James DeMonaco we'd be getting more of the same except this time with an inferior and unknown cast . That said one thing that really intrigued me was the large shift in positive votes . The first movie had an average vote of 5.6 while its sequel had an average vote of 6.5 along with many of the comments stating just how different it was from the original film , a film which incidentally could hardly have been called original itself The only real criticism I can level at TPA is that it's rather derivative and owes a lot to Anabasis by Xenophon , a very old story that Walter Hill made a career out of reworking and which recent Brit thriller '71 made use of . A good story never grows old whether you're a Greek army trapped behind enemy lines in 400 BC or a young couple trapped in a city centre where the laws of the jungle are about to be enforced the dilemmas facing the protagonists remain the same I had to double check a couple of times to check if there were two different writer/directors called James DeMonaco because I had hard task to believe the film maker who wasted so much potential in the first movie was the same one who crafted this heart stopping thriller . Everything wrong with THE PURGE is corrected here . Gone are the idiotic choices characters make and in their place are simple acts of misfortunes . Okay some bits seem a little contrived such as cars breaking down at the most inopportune moment but it's the same sort of cinematic convention you see in every /any thriller or horror movie . The characters are unlucky rather than out and out dumb and boy does misfortune have it in for these characters that you actually get to care about Another massive improvement is that you can almost believe this scenario might take place one day . I say almost because it's something of a stretch thinking Pat Robertson might be American president but this would be his ideal Utopian view of America and TPA does play up to all the more extreme elements of an outsiders view of America , gun culture , red necks ,the radical Christian right , rabid nationalism and corporate greed where money can buy you absolutely anything , all summed up by a very effective montage sequence at the closing credits . The politics of the film are not subtle but are superbly well done . There's perhaps a danger of taking it all this too seriously but TPA does deserve some credit for bringing this to our attention and wears its heart on its sleeve as to what's wrong at the heart of America And so ends one of these very rare films - a sequel that surpasses the original and by a wide margin too . Okay let's be honest and confess THE PURGE was no great shakes but TPA is one the most effective and thought provoking thrillers I've seen Hollywood produce in a very long time and after seeing THE PURGE I thought I'd never say this but I am really looking forward to THE PURGE 3 when it's released next year",The Purge - Anarchy

16,zardoz-13,Superior Sequel!!!,9,28 July 2014,"Eighteenth century Irish author and satirist Jonathan Swift would have enjoyed writer & director James DeManaco's violent, sanguine, urban crime thriller ""The Purge: Anarchy"" even more than its predecessor the home invasion epic ""The Purge."" The premise that our government has allocated one day annually for citizens to assuage their violent urges by committing criminal acts of any kind without fear of punishment is audacious. Moreover, since America has been purging for 6 years, the economy has improved significant and crime has been cut to the bone. ""The Purge: Anarchy"" is comparable to Swift's immortal essay ""A Modest Proposal."" Written in 1729, ""A Modest Proposal"" urged destitute Irishmen to sell their children as fodder to feed the insatiable appetites of the wealthy. In ""The Purge: Anarchy,"" a terminally-ill senior citizen, sells himself for $100-thousand to an affluent family so they can purge in the confines of their palatial mansion without risking their lives on the streets. Mind you, DeMonaco doesn't advocate the idea of an annual government-sanctioned crime holiday any more than Swift expected his impoverished counterparts to cannibalize their children. Hollywood doesn't often attempt to be as satirical as the ""Purge"" movies. Lately, ""The Hunger Games"" movies with their annual tournament of death is the closest that Tinsel town has come to incisive political satire for mainstream audiences. Unlike ""The Hunger Games,"" the ""Purge"" movies occur about a decade in the future. Nevertheless, everything looks and sounds like contemporary America as we know it. The New Founding Fathers, who rule America, appear to be ultra-conservatives, and they place a high premium on religion, but the God that they worship bears little resemblance to the popular, mainstream religious denominations. ""The Purge: Anarchy"" opens two hours and 26 minutes before the annual purge scheduled each March. Waitress Eva Sanchez (Carmen Ejogo of ""Absolute Beginners"") and another waitress Tanya (Justina Machado of ""Torque"") are waiting on their boss to let them go home for the evening. Things tonight are drastically different because it is purge night. Essentially, you can do anything criminal during this twelve-hour period, but the authorities cannot prosecute you. Eva tries to persuade her boss to raise her salary since she is finding it difficult to pay for her father's pricey medicine. Papa Rico (John Beasley of ""The General's Daughter"") hates this medicine and refuses to take it. Rico's granddaughter, Cali (Zoë Soul of ""Prisoners""), convinces him to take it. Rico warns Eva and Cali not to awake him from his slumber; all he wants to do is sleep through this terrifying holiday. Meanwhile, Eva informs Cali that her boss balked at her pay raise request. Later, these two women are shocked when they discover Papa Rico has sold himself to the highest bidder to be slaughtered. He has arranged matters so Eva and Cali will receive a small monetary fortune for his sacrificial act. Eva and Cali are sitting safely in their apartment when intruders in black combat gear with automatic weapons burst in and abduct them at gun point. In another part of the city, an anonymous individual known only as Sergeant (Frank Grillo of ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"") is arming himself to the teeth for an evening of purging. He knows how to wield a variety of lethal firearms. Sergeant is one tough looking dude, and he drives an evil black sedan with a trunk crammed with an arsenal of firearms. Sergeant is set to purge until he spots the thugs-in-black dragging Eva and Cali against their will from their apartment building. A menacing looking man in a baseball cap and a long butcher's apron, Big Daddy (Jack Conley of ""Payback""), who is standing in an 18-wheeler, wants the women. Against his better judgment, Sergeant intervenes. He riddles the thugs manhandling Eva and Cali, and one of his bullets creases Big Daddy's left cheek and knocks the villain off his feet. Sergeant escorts Eva and Cali back to his car, but he finds a surprise awaiting them. Two more innocent bystanders whose car broke down on them have taken refuge in his back seat, and he cannot force them to get out. Sergeant understands the old saying that the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. Big Daddy recovers in time to open fire with his machine gun that spews armor-piercing rounds. Our heroes escape his wrath, but Sergeant's car conks out on him because Big Daddy's bullets have blown out the engine. Sergeant and his quartet of refugees set out on foot through the city with Eva assuring him that he can get another car from her waitress friend Tonya at her apartment building. More surprises ensue for Sergeant and his new friends.Watching either ""The Purge"" or ""The Purge: Anarchy,"" you might be tempted to reprimand DeManaco for his implied advocacy of firearms and murder. In fact, however, DeManaco deplores the overt use of gunplay. What makes ""The Purge: Anarchy"" even more relevant is the class warfare theme that DeManaco has developed with even greater intensity than he did in ""The Purge."" DeManaco hammers home the theme of haves versus have-nots emphatically throughout this superior, slam-bang sequel. Meantime, the only link between the sequel and the original is an African-American supporting character that you might have missed, even if you've seen the original. He was referred to simply as the Bloody Stranger in ""The Purge."" In ""The Purge: Anarchy,"" he is designated strictly as the Stranger. If you have not seen ""The Purge,"" you won't appreciate the irony in actor Edwin Hodge's encore performance. Whereas ""The Purge"" occurred in a gated, elite neighborhood, ""The Purge: Anarchy"" expands the playing field to the city at large. For example, obese woman roams a bridge with a bull horn and a machine gun urging citizens to test her marksmanship. Buses set ablaze cruise through the night. DeManaco makes maximum use of his sinewy, 103 minutes to forge a palatable atmosphere of paranoia.",The Purge - Anarchy
17,Calicodreamin,Say yes to Frank Grillo,6,20 July 2021,"As far as purges go, this was a fairly well developed storyline with decent acting. There was some forced dialogue and odd plot points, but on the whole a good movie. Frank Grillo killed it, he could save me any day.",The Purge - Anarchy
18,view_and_review,Ain't no Party Like a Purge Party,7,27 January 2015,"The Purge, as I said after watching the first one, is an EXCELLENT concept. Not in reality of course, but for a movie. For the small minority of you reading this and aren't aware of the premise: the Purge is an event that occurs once a year (March 22nd I think) in which all crimes are legal, up to and including murder. The Purge lasts from 7 p.m. until 7 a.m. Level 10 and higher government employees are off limits (I'm assuming they're mayors, governors, senators and of course the president). The government does a more than adequate job announcing the event and giving people ample warning to get to safety.This rendition of the Purge chronicles the journey of some randomly meshed together individuals as they try to survive the night. This was just great because I remember after watching The Purge pt. 1 in the theater I left saying to myself (and in review) they should do a second Purge but broaden the focus from just one family to a wide swath people. They did just that in The Purge Anarchy.The Purge Anarchy was better than the first but it could have been so much better if it weren't for one and a half characters. I say one and a half because one character was wholly a nuisance and the other character was just somewhat irksome.The absolutely irritating character was Cali (Zoe Soul). She was annoying on so many levels, but mostly that she didn't know how to be quiet. She ran her mouth constantly. And she wasn't annoying in the comedic way but in the nagging ex-wife way mixed with the petulant, uncontrollable, know-it-all teen. Really, she brought annoying to new heights. Now, I think that the idea of a Purge is morally, ethically, and socially wrong. Having said that... Cali could have been a very unremorseful target.The other somewhat absurd character was the main character, Sergeant (Frank Grillo). Without giving away too much, he was a lot more patient, forbearing, kind and chivalrous than most would have been in the same situations. Remember, it's killing season and everyone is fair game.Again, The Purge delivers much to contemplate and discuss. And this time around they were even more creative in the method in which the Purge was celebrated which was very refreshing. It's easy to script wanton killing and mayhem from the riffraff and hoodlums but you get more than that. There was a nice touch of creative ingenuity in the script. A good follow up to the first.",The Purge - Anarchy

Williams, John Beasley. Filmmaker James DeMonaco returns in this unnecessary sequel to the widely popular thriller about a new form order of the USA in the not-too-distant future whereupon a sanctioned 12 hour day per year is a license to kill without persecution. More-or-less more of the same except now expanded exteriorly than interiorly as in the previous chapter with Grillo (in fine form) as man sent on vengeance who winds up helping a mother and daughter (Ejogo and Soul) and a young couple (Gilford and Sanchez) who are being pursued by purgers hellbent on killing them all. More taut and energized yet somewhat predictable than the original the film's strengths are in its fast direction and better-than-anticipated ensemble of little-known-actors.

20,neil-476,Better than its predecessor,7,8 August 2014,"A year ago we were introduced to the idea of The Purge: one night every year when all laws are suspended, and any crime can be committed without fear of consequences, resulting in lower crime rates for the rest of the year. People barricade themselves into their homes while the lawless prowl the streets. The wealthier you are, the better the security you can buy, but the first film showed that even the wealthiest are not guaranteed safety. This second movie follows the lives of various people who, for different reasons, are out on the streets.The Purge is an interesting idea: the first film was a claustrophobia / paranoia thriller, not executed particularly well: this follow-up (I wouldn't call it a sequel as, with one minor exception, it has nothing to do with any of the characters from the first film) is rather better. There is more action, and some of the characters are well enough drawn that you care about what happens to them.What this film shows is that there is life in this franchise. There are many more stories to be told about people caught up in the Purge, and there is more to find out about the Establishment's role in what goes on, and the actions of a resistance movement to do away with it.",The Purge - Anarchy
21,morrison-dylan-fan,The Purge 2.,8,31 July 2014,"With having enjoyed the thrilling,but deeply flawed first Purge,I was pleased to see that returning writer/director James DeMonaco appeared to have greatly expanded on the execution of his intriguing idea for the follow-up,which led to me getting ready to go on The Purge for the second time.The plot- 2017:With the US being in a never ending recession,and crime levels at an all-time high,a political group called The New Founding Father bring in a new law called The Purge,where for 12 hours,for 1 day every year,people are allowed to kill anyone they want, (apart from government members) in any method (apart from bombs/grenades) they desire.2023:As The Purge reaches its 6th year,large sections of society begin to campaign against the existence of The Purge,with the biggest anti-Purge group being Purge The Lies,who believe that The Purge has led to the wealthy gaining powers,as everyone below is destroyed.Heading home in their car as they start planning their divorce,Shane and Liz's car suddenly breaks down.With just minutes to go before The Purge starts,Shane and Liz find that someone cut the car wires.Shane and Liz soon begin to run for their lives,as a gang of Purgers arrive and announce that they cut the wires,so that the couple would be their first Purge. Whilst Shane and Liz run for survival, Eva Sanchez and her daughter Cali discover that Eva's dad Rico has secretly sold himself for an 'elite Purge',so that the family can pay off their debts.Keeping an eye on Eva for months,a neighbour breaks in,and reveals that he is going to kill Eva and Cali.Just as he takes aim,he is shot by a paramilitary group,who grip Cali and Eva and drag them on to the streets.Since the killer of his son was found not guilty thanks to a technicality, Sergeant Leo Barnes has been planning about using The Purge to finally get his revenge.Driving past Purges,Leo is shocked,when he sees a group of paramilitary trying to get 2 women. Impressive by the women's attempts to fight back,Leo gets out of the car and kills the gang;which leads to Leo going from a Purger,to a rebel who will do everything so that Eva Sanchez,Cali,Shane and Liz will survive The Purge.View on the film:Pulling the ideas that stayed at the outskirts of the first right to the centre, James DeMonaco focuses on the effect that The Purge has on the working class,and delivers an extremely vicious political satire.DeMonaco goes from the subtle, (all the members of the anti-Purge groups are poor,ethnic minorities which The Purge has largely been designed to kill) to the rather overt (The New Founding Father's using NSA style data gathering.) Along with the political element,DeMonaco also gives the screenplay a strong Neo-Noir revenge flavor,as DeMonaco shows Leo to be a loner anti- hero,who cares about saving people from the killings,but is haunted by the killer of his son walking free.Taking place across a whole city,DeMonaco hits the violence with an uncompromising eye,as DeMonaco splatters the streets with shots of blood and roaring fires which strike a terrifying 'Urban Horror' atmosphere,as DeMonaco shows all the streets become a living hell. Whilst the Purges sadly lack the devilish charisma of part 1's gang,the survivors build an excellent ensemble,with the very pretty Carmen Ejogo giving Eva's fight for Cali's survival a real rough edge,as Frank Grillo gives a superb performance as Leo,by putting Leo's painful grief deep within the characters troubled mind,as Leo steps out of his car,and enters The Purge.",The Purge - Anarchy
22,anaconda-40658,Why?,6,5 August 2015,"The Purge: Anarchy (2014): Dir: James DeMonaco / Cast: Frank Grillo, Carmen Ejogo, Zoe Soul, Zach Gilford, Kiele Sanchez: Sequel to the surprise thriller hit with a preposterous premise set in the future where a twelve hour purge allows crime, including murder to occur. This is to cut down on crime and down size employment by killing, more or less, anyone who cannot afford protection. Everyone boards up their homes while transport trucks full of SWAT teams burst in kidnapping anyone they can find to sell to the rich on purge night. Frank Grillo arms himself and sets out to kill the man responsible for the death of his son when killed while the guilty was under the influence of alcohol and got off on a technicality. He reluctantly ends up the protector of a handful of people struggling to survive the evening while being pursued by mobs of faces behind ominous masks. He saves a mother and daughter duo, played by Carmen Ejogo and Zoe Soul whom were being dragged out to a truck until Grillo intervened. Their father sold himself to the rich to be killed so that his daughter and granddaughter could reap the profit. Zach Gilford and Kiele Sanchez play a couple on the verge of breaking up. Their fuel line is cut and they become stranded on a bridge until they find refuge with Grillo. Screenplay is just a disturbing kill fest but the third act gives way to a moral element that allows this film to excel beyond what it would have been without it. Director James DeMonaco previously made the first film, which took place largely inside a house. Now he is outside with a well made but disturbingly routine picture of a grim future.

23,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Huge improvement over the original,7,10 July 2015,"On the Annual Purge Night, a former soldier seeking revenge for the death of his son must protect several groups of people stranded on the streets from the various maniacs and psychos honoring the tradition.This was easily better than the original and didn't have a whole lot really wrong with it. The biggest plus is the continuing exploration of the holiday depicted here, extrapolating the rules of survival far more than the initial one did which had a massive problem with that element yet here comes off rather nicely with the squad of soldiers retrieving the lowly citizens to allow for the privileged upper-class to enjoy the night without the need to leave the comforts of their house, the patrolling gangs to ensure that the citizens don't break the rules of the event and the different manner in which this one goes about the way of ensuring the freedom fighters try to take down the system with their attacks and ambushes. This kind of completeness to the story, which was missing greatly from the original, continues on here and allows for the great action to present within this as there's a greater degree of encounters, chases and gunfights that are continually featured throughout here. The action is top-notch with plenty of frantic chases through the city streets, down into the tunnels and finally off in the apartment complex, the gun-battles at the truck to get them free and down through the apartments leading into the finale which is quite exciting as the manhunt through the darkened room looked on by the elite as it turns into a thrilling, suspenseful battle before turning into a vicious gun-fight with the freedom fighters making the save. Though these do make the film enjoyable, the fact that this one carries over the problems from the original, including the lame-ness of the holiday itself by again awaiting a yearly-appointed time of day when criminal activity would be legally rendered and expunged from their conscious makes no sense at all even with the advent of the different elements at play within the story trying to expand it. Also, this features such a group of whacked-out individuals as these guys shown here who are clearly in it for the legalized murder rewards and have very little that shows them to be normal citizens on every other night of the year completely takes away the scare factor of them who just turn into mindless whackos without much thought which was part of the problem with the original as well. All told, this is still quite enjoyable though.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",The Purge - Anarchy
24,FlashCallahan,As good as the first.......,8,27 July 2014,"A couple are driving home when their car breaks down just as the annual Purge begins. A police sergeant goes out into the streets to get revenge on the man who killed his son, and a mother and daughter run from their home after assailants destroy it. The five meet up as they attempt to survive the night in Los Angeles.....What could have been just a blatant cash in of an unexpected hit, ala Sister Act, City Slickers, and Wayne's world 2, doesn't just expand on the world of The Purge, it makes for thrilling viewing.Doing exactly the opposite of the last film, and going out into to the middle of the madness, The Purge: Anarchy feels less like a horror/thriller, and oddly enough, more of a disaster movie in the vein of them trying to survive, and overcoming one obstacle after another.But the big thing here is the sub plot of status and how the New Founding Fathers are not just letting people vent their angers, but adding the point of cleansing the country of the poor, and the working class, which makes the film just that little more admirable.The makers could have easily have just turned into another full on gorenathon, as it would have found a following via DVD/Blu Ray, but to add the class into the mix isn't just clever, it actually infuriates the viewer, making it topical.The cast are great, and although the couple who's car breaks down can be a little annoying, the other three are brilliant, and you really do care for them.It's not for all tastes, its a high concept that either wins you over or doesn't, but I found it a thrilling movie, very tense in places, but the outcome is very satisfying, much like a Purge, I suppose.",The Purge - Anarchy
25,Sylviastel,Entertaining and Dark!,7,24 March 2017,"This film is a sequel to the film, ""The Purge,"" about a 12 hour holiday one night a year where all crimes are legal even murder in a futuristic world. Set in Los Angeles, California, there are a few people who get stranded and in trouble. Frank Grillo comes to their rescue. I saw an edited version of the film on television. They didn't show the gruesome crimes like murder especially white wealthy families killing somebody. The one scene in the mansion surrounded by plastic and people with sharp knives around him was horrifying enough for the imagination. There is also a purge auction where the bidders pay to kill their prey. Santa Barbara's Judith McConnell plays the auctioneer. It is creepy to watch them watching a real hunger games like pursuit. In only 12 hours, the Purge goes on and it's creepy in itself. Killing for sport one night a year to let people vent their frustrations. I got mad at Eva and her daughter for having lights and the television on in their apartment. You don't want to cause attention and be seen as a possible target. The Purge has its own rules and traditions which includes killing a person like a sacrifice. It's a frightening world to live in the purge. It still is entertaining.",The Purge - Anarchy

We see the masked gang and they looked indeed scary but you don't see them do anything. And that's the problem with The Purge Anarchy. There isn't any anarchy. It do has a better story but doesn't offer something special. It's sad to see that a title like this isn't working at all and still get's a lot of promo, just watch Dredd (2012) and you will see what I'm talking about.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5",The Purge - Anarchy

All the characters which display, aggression, resentment and violence project the lower natures of humanity into the movie's ugly feel. What did not work: Too many characters bogs down the story. One becomes disinterested with too many sub-stories which cannot blend into the film. The revolutionary characters lost their potential sub-story when they became another version of the purgers. What saved the movie is the ending. Will the lead protagonist lose his soul to the purge? A strong message for the ending. The negatives weigh down Anarchy, but still a watchable film.

It was more a home invasion film, anyway, whereas this really does grasp the mettle and run with the (however silly) original concept of mass killing for the good of all. Here though the odd notion is not only questioned as it is gleefully pursued but it is evident there are more dubious forces at work. Beautifully shot with some great night scenes and almost constant action with the story moving forward on various levels, this is a much underrated film, unfairly stuck with the poor reputation of the original. Believable dialogue and believable storyline (just).",The Purge - Anarchy
29,StevePulaski,"""To save or to take?"" is the question of the night",9,18 July 2014,"It was, admittedly, very difficult to disguise my massive disappointment with James DeMonaco's Purge just a little over a year ago, as I excited the theater deeply unsatisfied and underwhelmed at what I thought would be the most stimulating and thought-provoking thriller of the year. The film had a premise all its own, about a nation reborn thanks to a twelve-hour period of time, once a year, where all crime - including rape and murder - were legal and could be committed freely amongst people in an inconsequential manner. However, rather than focus on the chaos and the cacophony of madness just right outside, the film turned out to be a cheap and unremarkable home-invasion thriller, set from the perspective of a family who had the means to protect themselves during these treacherous times. It was like watching a social revolution from your mansion, overlooking a gigantic mountain through your tattered blinds and was about as fun as that sounds.The Purge: Anarchy, just from the trailers, looked to be not only the kind of film that would greatly improve upon its lukewarm but uncommonly ambitious predecessor, but also give audiences what they thought they were getting when they bought a ticket to see the original Purge film. I come confirming my judgments every time I saw the trailer in the theater; The Purge: Anarchy is a wonderful execution of one of the most original and frightening premises I've heard in this new decade. A tense, alive thriller and a well-acted display all the more, the film is also rich with commentary and thought-provoking drama and ideology surrounding the purge and bears an impact long after the lights go up.During the introduction of the film, we meet again, mere hours away from the commencement of the annual Purge, as I just explained above. We are following three distinct groups of people, all the while interjecting into lawless rats just waiting for the announcement to come across the loudspeakers and the sirens to ring so they can unleash hell upon this nation reborn. One is a young couple (Zack Gilford and Kiele Sanchez), on the brink of separation, taking back-routes, avoiding highways, just trying to get home to their sanctuary before all hell breaks loose. Another is a mother and daughter duo (Carmen Ejogo and Zoe Soul), who live in a low-income area, one of the many ones targeted by Purgers. Finally, we have the enigmatic Sergeant Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo), an attractive man riding in a bulletproof Mustang, who is clearly seeking some form of vengeance on this night.This group of people come together when the mother and daughter duo find themselves about to be victim to a man in a heavily-armored car with a turret, once The Purge commences. Leo steps in, after spur-of-the-moment contemplation, and shoots up their attackers before finding the young couple inside his car begging for a ride. The five are now in this together, looking for some brief form of refugee away from the violence, but one with unfinished business to take care of; the main objective now becomes survive the night, avoiding any and all kinds of lawlessness while desperately trying to keep everyone close and out of harm's way.The film lives up to its title in the regard that the film's pacing stays consistent, never slowing down and never coming down to a grinding halt to let some unexpectedly boring bout of moralistic integrity play with the characters. The film remains a worthwhile riot, quite literally, using its solid array of actors (especially Grillo, who is captivating and mystifying as the main lead in the film). Not to mention, The Purge: Anarchy rights one of its predecessor's biggest wrongs, which is identifying why The Purge allegedly reduces crime rate, why it allegedly lessens unemployment, and why it has allegedly been successful, along with its New Founding Fathers. It does all this by introducing a thoroughly interesting group of rebels, who work to combat The Purge and all it stands for, run by its humanist leader, who believes The Purge is just an event to eliminate the poor and help the wealthy increase their capital and their egos.Consistently, writer/director DeMonaco ushers in new ideas, zealously welcoming many different aspects of what could happen in a usually-populated downtown area during this psychotic night, while leaving (most likely purposefully) numerous ideas unexplored. Just the last twenty minutes of the film could be used as the building blocks for another screenplay revolving around this twelve hour escapade. I would be interested in seeing three or four more films exploring this idea from different perspectives - the wealthy, the homeless, gang-infested areas, and so forth, for The Purge idea still feels extremely unexplored, even with two films directly catering to the idea.The Purge: Anarchy finds the rare and often blurred crossroads between extremely graphic violence and social commentary, satisfying parties who came for the carnage and the parties who came for the insight both fittingly and accordingly. Unlike many films with sizable ambition, the film goes for broke, and as a result, succeeds because it has clearly thought about this idea and its impact, and creates one of the tensest pieces of film the year 2014 has yet to see (keep in mind, all this was erected from one of 2013's most lackluster and disappointing films).Starring: Frank Grillo, Zack Gilford, Kiele Sanchez, Carmen Ejogo, and Zoe Soul.

30,disdressed12,it's that time of year again,7,6 October 2016,"I enjoyed this second film in the Purge series of films.this one has nothing at all to do with the first one.the characters are all different.the premise s the same.the U.S. government has sanctioned one twelve hour period each year where all crime is legal.the movie starts out with three different groups of people trying to make it through thru the night.eventually these three groups meet up and band together to survive the purge.this film had more action the previous one and it was more exciting.the novelty of the premise wears off though and it becomes a better than average action adventure movie.plus it echoes a few other films with similar themes.when you add it all up,though it's still an entertaining movie.for me,The Purge: Anarchy is a 7/10",The Purge - Anarchy

While the first ""Purge"" movie took place within the confound of someone's home. This movie takes place within the boundaries of a whole city. While the first movie was super annoying to watch, this one is at least passable. Yeah, there is still some of those dumb moments where it just doesn't make much sense at all. But the combining of the different elements is integrated alright in this. Like the rebel groups and crazy psychotic rich people. And there always has to be those few really annoying characters that ruins it. The premise is like watching ""Manhunt"" on the big screen except the victims are innocent civilians. And it's a premise if it's applied to real life, it's actually the epitome of stupid in my opinion. Overall this is a film that is worth a watch, but it's quite forgettable and isn't anything more.6.3/10",The Purge - Anarchy
32,Hellmant,Takes the great ideas of the original film and expands on them.,8,19 July 2014,"'THE PURGE: ANARCHY': Four Stars (Out of Five) Sequel to the 2013 hit horror flick about an annual 12 hour period of time when all crime is legal. The original film focused on one family, who's attacked in their home during 'the Purge'. This installment tells the story of a cop, a mother and daughter and a couple who all meet and try to survive the Purge together. It was once again written and directed by James DeMonaco and co-produced by Michael Bay. It stars Frank Grillo, Carmen Ejogo, Kiele Sanchez, Zach Gilford, Zoe Soul and Michael K. Williams. I thought the first movie was interesting (and as disturbing as hell). This film is even better! Grillo plays a police sergeant named Leo Barnes. While most people try to stay safe at home, during the Purge, Barnes ventures out into it. He lost his son a year earlier and wants revenge. Sanchez and Gilford play a couple named Liz and Shane. They're driving to Shane's sister's house, to hide out at during the Purge, when their car breaks down shortly before 'commencement'. Ejogo plays a waitress named Eva. Eva is struggling to make enough money to support her sick father, Papa Rico (John Beasley), and young daughter, Cali (Soul). Their apartment building is attacked by a death squad and Eva and Cali are dragged out into the street. Leo sees them about to be killed and reluctantly intervenes. Eva and Cali then look to Barnes for protection. So do Liz and Shane, as they try to escape the gang chasing them.I find the premise for these movies to be pretty interesting; it's a flawed one but still makes for compelling movies. The first movie was memorable because of the unique plot but it didn't explore the concept very much. It was well directed, disturbing and has a great performance from Ethan Hawke though. This sequel takes the great ideas of the original film and expands on them; it really examines what a society, that lives in a world like that, would be like. It also explains the government's main reasoning for the Purge. The characters are all likable and Grillo makes an awesome anti-hero. I cared about the central characters so much that I even got a little choked up at the ending. I can't remember the last time I did that during a slasher flick.

33,thesar-2,Purge the First One,7,18 February 2016,"All the way through this, I kept thinking I liked the first one, but this one's slightly better. I immediately purged those thoughts when I saw I gave the first one a scathing 1½/5 star review.This is one of those rare sequels that destroys the first one by far. Though I did like 28 Days Later, The Purge: Anarchy reminded me of that franchise's superior follow-up, 28 Weeks Later. Both part 2s took the original, somewhat low-budget and ran like mad with a larger bankroll and even better talent.Now, this movie isn't perfect by any means, including the same far- fetched premise from the first one: for 12 consecutive hours of the year people get to break almost every law, including murder, without consequence and this causes the other 364½ days to have almost complete peace. Of course, this would never happen in real life and it's even absurd in the movie with idiots tempting faith to be anywhere outside during this obvious trap. Even I would own the fact I would be murdered if I was driving home within minutes of the Doomed Countdown Clock and my car broke down. Heck, I wouldn't even be in the country days before the event since it supposedly only happens here in the U.S.A.But, I digress. That plus some predictability, overused themes and copycats of other big film series, I still had a great time. Especially after seeing what I wrote in my first moviethis is a near masterpiece in comparison.The annual Purge is upon us again, only instead of the singular home invasion of the previous year, we have several groups of people either stuck outside, dragged outside or outside with a vengeance. Of course, they all meet together and are led by the mysterious and reluctant (anti-)hero, Discount Christian Bale to hopefully survive the 12 crazy hours in downtown L.A. Lucky for us, there's so much more of the grand scheme of the Purge's Plight to keep us invested than what kinda just looked like a merged The Walking Dead with its prequel, Fear the Walking Dead, sans the Walkers.It started off so-so for me, then with one jump-scare I didn't see coming, I was onboard. I did like the Discount Christian Bale and it helps I always love characters like him, no matter how many times I see them. And though, I also liked the action and suspense, I really liked the more information given than the bland original. Further, the characters, however wooden, clichéd and one of which downright annoying (yeah, daughter, I'm talking about you) were good enough to root for. If you can forgive the large deus ex machina towards the end – it might as well been the ""quiet and hiding"" T-Rex at Jurassic Park's climax – and some of the clichés and yeah-right moments, it's thoroughly entertaining. Totally worth seeing and no, you need not or SHOULD NOT see the first one to enjoy this Purge.***Final thoughts: I spoke with a couple of people today that either have seen the first one or not and still interested in this one. Surprisingly, it was split for the people who loved or disliked the original and no one had seen this chapter yet. Since I wasn't a fan, to put it mildly, of #1, I am uncertain if you loved the first, you would love this one, as well. It's hard to tell since, though they keep the same theme and premise, they're far different in scale and scope. I'd still highly recommend this one and am definitely seeing the, hopefully last, chapter coming soon. (And I say ""hopefully last"" since the Purging idea can really only be stretched too far. I mean, it's kind of a stretch to begin with)",The Purge - Anarchy

35,Robert_duder,Builds and improves on the already fascinating concept,8,26 October 2014,"The first film, The Purge, was a very interesting concept. It absolutely held a ton of social commentary and gave us a dark and twisted look at the human condition. It was a thriller, a mystery, a horror, a drama...all wrapped up into one. But it truly only felt like the tip of an iceberg. It left you wanting more. It left me wondering about the world outside of the house. I wanted to know more about this government and the purge and all the details eluded too but not elaborated on. So it would stand to reason that in the right hands, The Purge: Anarchy would be even better and it was!! Because the first film was so successful they were able to get a decent budget and give us what we all wanted. This is the world of The Purge. Interwoven stories and a group of people desperately trying to survive. With every question it answers, another one is posed, leaving far more for them to build on than your average mainstream thriller. I don't mean to imply that this series is brilliant but it does work very well and there is some genuine thought and creativity behind this so kudos to the creators. Many reviewers point out plot holes but really that is inevitable. They are out to make money and this series has done that.I really liked the fact that the film was void of any ""A"" List Hollywood actors. I think these movies are best suited to great actors that you don't necessarily already know and love. Frank Grillo was perfect as the father out for vengeance who becomes a reluctant hero. Grillo is a bad-ass and his character is mysterious and captivating. He definitely carried the film well. Carmen Ejogo and Zoe Soul are decent as mother and daughter on the run for their lives. They weren't my favourite characters but they are necessary and they have their moments. Zach Gilford and Kiele Sanchez are excellent as a young couple having troubles who find themselves stranded in the middle of The Purge. The entire film could have focused on them and they both play their roles extremely well. You absolutely become attached to the cast and they all have very important roles and everyone is at least good at it. One of the most unique things about this film is that there isn't really a ""villain"", but rather bad people doing bad things during this sanctioned event.The Purge: Anarchy starts out as one type of film but doesn't keep itself in the genre. It sort of gives you elements from all sides of this event from the rich to the poor and to the people stuck in it, and the people taking part in it. It really is quite well made. It is entertaining, disturbing, often hard to watch and if you want to analyze it there is a ton of social and political commentary here to discuss but if you want to sit back and watch it mindlessly you can certainly do that too. While I don't think either film is ""brilliant"" I am completely fascinated by the series so far and this was a step above the first one so they are going in the right direction. Despite the fact that The Purge is really the only thing director James DeMonaco has helmned, he clearly has a very specific direction in the mind with the series and he does it well. I will definitely be watching for the next instalment. Check both films out and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised...and disturbed!! 8/10",The Purge - Anarchy
36,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Explores the concept in a different style, with hit and miss results",7,30 April 2015,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning The annual 'purge' night in America has rolled round again, and this time we find a mother and daughter on the run after their home was invaded and their grand-father offered himself up as a sacrificial lamb, as well as a couple whose car has broken down on Purge night. These two parties are joined together by a vengeful man out to find the man who killed his child, and together they must struggle to survive the night, as dark forces close in.There are actually three certainties in life, death, taxes and sequels to critically acclaimed, financially successful and cult forming films that explored new and exciting formulas. And so The Purge: Anarchy has rolled around. This time, the concept is explored from an agoraphobic, rather than a claustrophobic setting, removed from the confines of a house to the wide, urban arena of the outside world. This setting, at least at the beginning, is used to great effect, with the eerie atmosphere of the outside world being deserted and the ominous 'purge siren' ringing through the air, after the 'public broadcast' message before it.There seems to be more of a stab at social commentary here, with the Purge phenomenon being explored as a tool being used by the rich and powerful as a means of population control, and surging up sales in firearms. The first film was an intelligent idea in itself, and explored it's themes and ideas in a far more succinct way that kept the audience engaged. While the new Purge film is not a bad effort, it suffers from pacing problems, and fails to consistently keep up the momentum required to keep the audiences attention. That's not to say it isn't effective and doesn't have moments that work very well, it's just not as astute and on the ball as it's predecessor.As sequels go, though, and with so many of them around, this is still one of the better ones, proving that horror thrillers with a stab at anti-establishment zeitgeist must do better second time round than comedies. ***",The Purge - Anarchy
37,bowmanblue,Ticks every generic box,6,16 February 2015,"I'm writing this review straight after seeing 'The Purge 2: Anarchy' simply because I'm guessing I probably won't remember it in a couple of days time (and, if I ever completely forget, at least I can read my own review to remind myself that I probably don't need to watch it a second time). Okay, so that may sound like I hated it. I didn't. Then again, I can't really think of anything positive to say about it either. It's one of those films that left me with no real lasting impressions, good or bad.If you watched the first 'Purge' film, you'll know that crime has pretty much been eradicated in the America of the near future. How has this been achieved you may ask? By allowing all citizens to (legally) commit any form of crime they like for a short period of time (I think it's just the night, but it might have been as long as twenty-four hours). During this time you're free to murder, steal and assault anyone you please and the police and other emergency services are 'off duty' and therefore won't stand in your way. The reason behind this is – apparently – to allow man's primitive urges to be released, hence stopping them from doing it for the rest of the year. And, if you can try not to think too deeply about that (as you'll probably come up with plenty of plot holes in that kind of society) you'll probably at least be able to sit through the film.The only problem is... find yourself out on the streets during this time and you're really in trouble. And that's exactly what happens to our five unwitting heroes. So, a small group of people must survive the night against gangs of normally sane and rational people, all hell-bent on murdering for the sake of it.Unfortunately, I didn't really think much in the way of the characters. They're all pretty generic. They run, they scream. Sometimes they fight back and there are a few reasonably well-shot shoot outs and chases. That's about it really.It's an action movie. It has chases in. It tries to make itself stand out with various social commentary on mankind's primitive desires and so forth, but, ultimately, if you've seen any film that's centred around people trying to survive something (anything!) then you've kind of seen this before. It's not so bad. It's not horrible. Like I said, I can't really think of anything really negative to say about it, other than there's just nothing new here that warrants a second viewing.",The Purge - Anarchy
38,dromasca,to survive the night,8,4 February 2019,"The issue with science fiction books or films that address the future with pessimism is that the imaginary stories tend to become reality faster than their authors expect. This does not prevent most science fiction creators today from imagining the apocalypse or post-apocalyptic worlds, societies dominated by violence or under the dictatorship of various kinds. Science-fiction has become almost synonymous with dystopia. The action movies series 'The Purge' belongs to this category. The first movie in the series came out on screen in 2013. The action of the second movie in the series, 'The Purge: Anarchy', which I saw now, made in 2014, takes place in the America of 2023. The nightmare described in the film is generated by ... elected politicians.2023. Crime has been reduced to almost zero, unemployment is lower than ever. America seems to have solved its problems of law and order. The price? One night a year, for 12 hours, crimes of any kind are legal. The wealthy are barricaded in well-guarded houses, they even organize bloody orgies in which the victims belong to the categories who can not afford shelter and defense. Criminals kill each other or exercise their thirst for violence on victims selected among those who can be found in the streets. Most of the population supports this policy, legislated by politicians and encouraged by the government. The slogan of this 'renewal'? 'America Reborn'. The film's heroes, a few people surprised by the yearly Purge on the streets, or who are thrown by circumstances in the midst of violence, will try to survive the night.James De Monaco, the creator of the series (three feature films and now also a television series) and the director of the film, wanted to create a good action thriller whose story is taking place in the near future. He has succeeded well, the story in this second film in the series has logic, editing is alert and the action scenes bind well. The actors team does not include any famous names, which has reduced costs and made the movie profitable since its first week, but all actors are well-chosen and act professionally. Beyond the pleasure of watching a well-done action movie, the idea of the movie is interesting and the questions put in the subtext are as real as possible. Can more violence solve the problem of violence? (a current question in an America where the right of every citizen to wear weapons is guaranteed by the Constitution). Can the lack of law and order, for a limited period of time, solve the endemic problem of law and order? Of course, what's happening in the movie is a metaphor, but the questions are as actual as possible. This good dystopian action movie succeeds to be more than it aimed to be.",The Purge - Anarchy
39,ThomasDrufke,Horror??,4,26 July 2014,"I'm not a horror fan for the pure reason that I don't find being scared fun. I would much rather laugh or be thrilled by a great action sequence so when I say I hated a horror movie take it with a grain of salt. With that being said, by no means is this a horror film. I jumped one time and wasn't scared one bit. To go along with the fact that I saw a late showing, this movie should have scarred me to the bones. It did absolutely nothing for me.The concept is really cool but also incredibly frightening. A situation that I would hope our world never has to come to. But the movie doesn't do much to actually achieve that wow factor. The actors are poor with the exception of Frank Grillo who was also great in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The fact that ANYBODY would even go remotely close to a big city when commencement begins is beyond belief. It's never even explained why the couple is headed towards the city anyway. I was hoping to feel emotionally connected to these characters but no connection was present. Deaths didn't effect me to the least and the times when the actors acted close I reminded myself that these characters had known each other for a half a day.Sure the idea and plot is fascinating but nothing ever comes together with this one. I didn't see the first Purge but I heard it suffered from the same things. Just poor execution.

When they all end up meeting outside they are in a fight for their lives in a city where anything goes. I have to admit that I did like the first one.

42,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,4 October 2014,"The Purge: AnarchyThe sad thing about hunting Americans for sport is that they're so obese they're tired after running 10 paces.Luckily, the prey in this horror-thriller has a vehicle. To lower crime, LA holds an annual cull - legalized murder for one night.Trying to get home before it begins, Shane (Zach Gilford) and Liz (Kiele Sanchez) align themselves with a vengeful cop (Frank Grillo) and two women he rescued from Purgers.Unfortunately, those women are being stalked by a gang of masked murderers collecting the poor for the rich in exchange for money.With the action happening outside as opposed to inside, like its predecessor, Anarchy offers a blue-collar perspective on the yearly bloodletting. While the ideology continues to fascinate and the killings carryon the brutality, the characters and the plot still don't reach their full potential. Incidentally, without the poor, city streets would be littered with unreturned beer bottles. Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",The Purge - Anarchy

45,ironhorse_iv,The Purge: Anarchy indeed release the beast. It was pretty entertaining.,7,31 July 2014,"The Purge: Anarchy is way better than its predecessor, 2013's The Purge, but it's still an outrageous concept that takes itself too serious. It was alright watch for the most part. Honestly, the movie directed and written by James DeMonaco, has potential, for more, if the movie tries to be a dark satire, but it fails because it takes its ridiculous premise too seriously. Like my previous review on the Purge, the sequel movie does also a poor attempt to explain why the Purge works. It's kinda explains that the Purge is there to eraser the poor, but it never explain how killing the poor, make the economy, great. The upper rich are stereotype cartoony villainous. I doubt that the rich is that willing to kill, the people that drive their business, going. There is nothing to gain. Honestly, if people had the right to purge, I think the rich would be more of a target, than the poor, anyways. If unemployment is 1%, how many poor people are there, anyways?? The movie doesn't explain how the country went from bankruptcy to prosperity through violence through Social Darwinism. I guess, we can say, the government of the new founder fathers were lying, about the purge working, but it doesn't explain why people would wait to vent their negative emotions for one day that crime is all legal, and emergency service are suspended. Anger, Lust, and Greed is an impulse reaction that some human cannot control. People will act upon it, no matter if it's the day of the purge or not. It's all crime with passion. It doesn't explain, how crazy people with mental instability, are able to wait for the Purge to commit crimes. It doesn't make sense. Murder, Rape, and Stealing will happen, any day. There always going to be rule-breakers and people that act on impulse. This can't stop crime. I'm glad this movie got away from the normal home invasion of the first movie, and went into the lawlessness anarchy of the streets. Indeed, this movie got a bigger budget, and it shows with the action. The movie has more of it. One thing, the movie does better is not to have all the action in the dark. It's more like an action movie thriller than a horror movie. The movie indeed had more interesting characters. Frank Grillo as a Sergeant Leo Barnes is a badass. My favorite part in the movie is him, yelling at the old woman. He has a lot of good-one liners. I hope to see him in more action movie, besides this as the lead. This guy is going places. The female leads of Carmen Ejogo as Eva Sanchez and Zoë Soul as her daughter, Cali, are a big annoying, but for the most part, works as the moral compass character arch preacher. Still, there were a bit too many characters in this film. I think the couple, Shane (Zach Gilford) & Liz (Kiele Sanchez) were pretty weak characters. Honestly, they could had be cut out from the film. It was nice to see Edwin Hodge reprises his role of Dwayne from the first movie. I'm also glad, there wasn't a lot of over the top overacting like Rhys Wakefield's Polite Leader from the first movie. The ending is a bit anti-climax for a movie call, the Purge: Anarchy. I really thought, the government will be overthrown or something by the end. It didn't happen. I know the movie, explain the rules of the Purge, like not using high tech weapons like dirty nuke bombs, chemical weapons, and Biochemistry warfare, but you would think that somebody would say, screw the rules, it's the purge, go crazy, and attack the government that made this dumb law. If you going to make a movie about anarchists, at less, have them fight more against the fascist government. Honestly, I think the movie play it a little too safe. It could had dealt with more controversial issues like terrorism, school-shootings, and others. Still, the movie did had some type of a society commentary. The movie is clearly influence by the 1967 episode of Star Trek call 'Return of the Archons' with a similar plot, in which an otherwise placid society is allowed pre-scheduled 12-hour periods of lawlessness and violence. This movie was also influence by works like Koushun Takami's Battle Royale, Richard Connell's The Most Dangerous Game, Suzanne Collins's Hunger Games and John Carpenter's Escape from New York. It was pretty entertaining shoot it up movie. Remind me of Grand Theft Auto: Free Range mixed with the politics of Bio-Shock. Due to the movie success, a third movie will probably be made. I'll be looking forward to that. Overall: If you don't nitpick the weird concept too much, you might find this movie worth the time, watching. It's a good watch.",The Purge - Anarchy

There is a couple whose car broke down and they have to survive by themselves during the night, a police officer who wants to take revenge for his son death and a mother with her daughter who left their home after an attack.Since I had already watched the first movie I had high hopes and expectations from this movie and I have to admit that it reached its potential. It wasn't as good as the first movie but still, I think that it was a nice movie which had an interesting plot like the first and some very good interpretations. About the direction which was made again by James DeMonaco, I believe that he did a great job for one more time and presented us a nice film. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, Frank Grillo who played as Police Sergeant made a very good interpretation and Carmen Ejogo who played as Eva Sanchez made an equally good one.In conclusion, I have to say that ""The Purge: Anarchy"" is a good movie to watch, it reached its potential and despite that, it isn't as good as the first movie, it's a decent sequel to watch. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because once more I am sure that you are going to enjoy it.

48,Floated2,Different take on the original,7,19 September 2019,"Given the success that the Purge made in 2013, a sequel was obvious and it was made in no time just released a year later. Having enjoyed the original film for what it was but seeing its flaws and having that film feel as if it was rushed, this sequel feels bigger, better looking (nicer camera work, overall better visuals) and somewhat more intrigued.Even with a lesser known cast it doesn't matter too much since the premise of its selling is the concept. And even with that, Frank Grillo is a very solid lead choice here, along with Carmen Ejogo and the daughter portrayed good sympathetic and likeable characters.Anarchy does feel more realistic and we see more of the city and the action is just as good if not better.

49,leonblackwood,Could have been better if they had some decent actors! 4/10,4,3 January 2015,"Review: After really enjoying the first movie in this franchise, I couldn't really get into this film. I found the characters pretty annoying and it takes ages to get going. There was a sense of intensity throughout, which made the film watchable, but it was no way as good as the first movie. Personally,I think the main problem with the film is that you don't really care who lives or dies. I also was expecting more from the actually Purge itself, but the director seemed to concentrate on the characters running around in the dark trying to get to the car more than fighting against the Purgers. Then the movie takes a twist and they end up fighting against these rich people, which didn't last that long, then the main character seeks revenge for his son but sees the light and backs out of the whole situation. Weird! Anyway, I was expecting more from this sequel, but it's a watchable movie which could have been better if they had casted some decent actors. Watchable!Round-Up: Although I didn't really find this movie that amazing, it still made a hefty profit at the box office. I honestly think that it's due to the original movie, which starred Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey from the Game of Thrones. The only familiar face that I saw in this film was the lead character Frank Grillo, who I recently saw in Captain America and in other movies like Warrior, Gangster Squad and the Grey. He just seemed moody throughout the movie and his action scenes wasn't that amazing so it could have done with an actor with screen charisma to play the lead. The storyline went from one instance to another and the characters didn't really bond until the end, so with all that intensity, there just wasn't that much emotion. I just hope that they use the profits to hire some big names for the 3rd outing.Budget: $9million Worldwide Gross: $110.6millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their intense thrillers about a group of people fighting to survive through the annual Purge and a man seeking revenge for his sons death. 4/10",The Purge - Anarchy
50,TheMovieDiorama,The Purge Anarchy steps outside onto city streets and lets chaos ensue.,7,9 October 2018,"Forget about its predecessor which was a forgettable home invasion thriller. This sequel is a perfect example in realising a concept. ""Purging"" is an intriguing idea, one that means something different to various socioeconomic groups in America. Of course entirely fictional (at least for now...), this film illustrates the possibilities and consequences of the existence of such a law. Three groups of strangers coincidentally join together in an attempt to survive the night of the annual ""Purge"". DeMonaco fully conceptualises the ""Purge"" and thoroughly explores various backgrounds. The perspective of those in poverty who just want to survive, the view of the wealthy who pay for martyrs and specific individuals who purge for personal gains. The ""cleanse your body"" ethos that surrounds this law masquerades its true intentions of culling the population. Governmental agents sent specifically to target buildings in areas of low economic wealth. Intriguing yet intimidating. I'm just glad it only took one sequel to showcase the daunting politics of the ""Purge"". The strikingly vivid chaos ranges from dark alleyways littered with traps to quiet neighbourhoods that gradually become polluted with the piercing sound of gunfire. For some reason unbeknown to me, everyone who is purging suddenly become maniacal and insane, even going so far as to wearing masks (which is pointless if you're allowed to murder by law?). Unfortunately this aspect isn't explored as thoroughly. The acting was pretty good, particularly from Grillo who exhumes anger and rage. A few plot conveniences here and there, the most noticeable being saved at the last minute in the hunting room. Really? Seemed like a cheap way out to me. But it remains enjoyable throughout, exploring political and social commentaries that may just be apt for today's society, whilst containing plenty of violence and a few jump scares. A sequel that improves almost entirely on its predecessor. The real question is: ""would you purge?"".",The Purge - Anarchy
51,pmtelefon,Pretentious Nonsense,3,21 September 2014,"I gave first Purge movie a pass. It was passable, yet forgettable, suburban thriller. However, ""The Purge:Anarchy"" is just a heavy handed waste of time. The first third is 99%er speechifying, second third is bad John Carpenter followed more 99%er garbage. The movie is a failure. The change in setting from the first movie (suburban to urban) works against the silly premise. Why don't the hoods just burn everything down? Do they respect property more than people? That doesn't sound like the way angry 99%ers would act. Also, with the exception of the mom the rest of the characters were totally forgettable. If you don't care about the characters, you don't care about the movie. It just becomes tedious and boring. I know someone that always refers to movies from the 1940s as propaganda. Why? Because some of them showed evil as evil? ""The Purge:Anarchy"" is a propaganda film that fails because its ""cause"" is phony and its audience is bored.",The Purge - Anarchy

55,jtindahouse,What the first should have been,9,9 September 2014,"12 hours where all crime is legal. Sounds like a fun concept for a movie, right? Does to me at least. Yet somehow the original managed to take that concept and make a movie exploring next to none of the thousands of possibilities this scenario would bring about. Thankfully they learnt their lesson for the sequel.This time around they got it right. They explore as much as they can possibly fit into an hour and a half (which is probably only the tip of the iceberg). I wouldn't be surprised if this turned into another series similar to Saw where we are quickly reaching the fourth, fifth and even sixth sequel in as many years, for the simple reason that there is so much you can do with this idea. It starts out at a rapid pace, slows down for a brief period through the middle and then ignites again for the third act. Overall it's well paced and keeps you on the edge of the seat throughout. The only real criticism for me would be the lack of any twist which I felt the film lent itself to. Everything rapped up a little neatly for my liking considering the amount of anarchy which had preceded it. A good sequel certainly much better than the original.",The Purge - Anarchy
56,stevendbeard,Great Sequel,8,18 July 2014,"I saw ""The Purge:Anarchy"", starring Frank Grillo-Captain America:The Winter Soldier, Zero Dark Thirty; Kiele Sanchez-The Glades_t.v., A Perfect Getaway; Zach Gilford-The Last Stand, Friday Night Lights_t.v. and Carmen Ejogo-Alex Cross, The Avengers_1998, that's not the super hero one, but the one with Steed & Mrs Peel.This is the second in the Purge series-Yes, I'm betting that there will be more-with the first one being from a year ago-2013- maybe it's going to be an annual event. For those unfamiliar with the premise; One day a year-I think it is March 21st-there is a new sanctioned government holiday where any crime is legal. All police stations and any other official law enforcement agencies are closed from 7:00 p.m. until 7:00 a.m. the next morning. During this time people can either purge-by committing any crime they want to, including murder-or if they do not want to participate, can barricade themselves indoors until it's over. The government claims that the purge has reduced crime because it gives people a chance to release all their pent up anger- So, I guess you better not make anyone mad during the rest of the year. The year is 2023 and the city is Los Angeles, with the purge in it's sixth year. Frank plays a former cop that wants to participate-he has a specific person he wants to purge. Zach and Kiele are a couple that get stranded outside, due to car problems at the wrong time-just as the purge is commencing. Carmen is a waitress that gets taken from her apartment building, along with her daughter, by some mysterious uniformed purgers. Frank comes along and saves Kiele, Zach, Carmen and her daughter but then has to run a gauntlet of purgers throughout the rest of the city. One of the new things to look for is the big 18 wheel trucks that go around snatching live people off the streets to sell to rich people-it seems that they are so rich, they can have people brought to them for purging, so that they do not even have to leave the comforts of their homes or clubs. I also liked the way people would say goodbye before the purge started; ""Stay Safe!"" It's rated ""R"" for the violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 43 minutes.

It's not a movie about class and morality, but about violence--our own. We are the audience, after all, and we must be purged ,too. This films were awesome. Do not piss me off .",The Purge - Anarchy
58,estebangonzalez10,One of those rare sequels that are better than its predecessor,5,6 November 2014,"""The unwritten Purge rule: don't save lives. Tonight we take lives. We make things manageable.""James DeMonaco returns as the director and writer of the sequel to his 2013 film, The Purge. My expectations for this sequel were extremely low because I didn't like The Purge and thought the premise was ridiculous, but if you enjoyed the first film then you will definitely like this one. I'd like to begin my review by focusing on what did work for this sequel before I get to its weaknesses. First of all, The Purge: Anarchy is a huge improvement over its predecessor. While the first film followed the conventions of a home invasion horror film, this sequel takes the original premise and establishes the action in a much wider setting. It doesn't set out to repeat the same things from its predecessor. This sequel takes us to the streets where we can see how the purge takes place out in the open where the danger is eminent. Considering that the characters were the least interesting part of The Purge, this time the story doesn't center on one family, but gives us three different story lines and later brings them together. This makes up for the lack of character development in the film and allows for the movie to be more entertaining. It is a B picture that gives its target audience what they are looking for. The second positive thing this sequel has going for it is the lead performance from Frank Grillo. He delivers as a smooth action star despite the weaknesses of the screenplay. He is the only engaging character in the entire franchise. Despite that The Purge Anarchy is much better than its predecessor, it still is a flawed film full of horror clichés and unimaginative characters. The film relies on jump scares that never work. All it seemed to be doing at times was suddenly turning up the volume when things were quiet in order to shock or unsettle its audience. The characters never seem to make smart decisions and they all rely on Grillo's lead performance. With all the horrible crimes he drives through during his purge mission, we never quite understand why he would care for these two particular characters he stops for in order to save them. It was simply an easy way to reunite the different story lines, but I didn't find anything unique in that mother and daughter relationship that he would be interested in assisting. Its not like he was painted as a saint during the opening scenes where he drove past several people crying out for help. The sequel also tries to be an interesting parody of our society and a slick social commentary, but it isn't really as smart as it thinks it is. Every time I heard the phrase our ""new founding fathers"" my ears bled and I couldn't help but finding it silly. The film also is heavy handed on its rich versus poor commentary, and it is something we see often in adaptations from YA books. The villains never post a significant threat either, but Grillo elevates the source material with his smooth performance. The rest of the characters I couldn't really care less for.",The Purge - Anarchy
59,mattkratz,pretty good sequel,8,14 October 2014,"This wasn't too bad a sequel to the original. It continues the original's idea of the ""purge""-where, in the near future, one night a year, for twelve hours, all crime (with a few minor exceptions) is legal to ease the prison overcrowding prison problem in America. Unlike the first film, where the action takes place virtually entirely in Ethan Hawke's house, this film takes place mostly on the streets and has two basic elements:anarchy and revenge. It focuses mainly on a young couple whose car breaks down at the wrong time and a poor family who gets ""locked out,"" and they get hooked up with someone, and they are all at the mercy of everyone who's ""purging."" I think this was pretty good and, mercifully, spared of a good portion of the graphic violence they could have shown. I loved the scene where they did a ""Hunger Games"" type scene. I'd rank it about as good as the first one.** 1/2 out of ****",The Purge - Anarchy

I won't talk about the plot or story as tons of others already have. FRANK GRILLO is Fantastic as the lone vigilante Hero in this film & his performance is Excellent he's a tough not very talkative old school style Hero like a Charles Bronson in Death Wish or a Clint Eastwood in Dirty Harry or a Kurt Russell in Escape from New York,he's made in that great mould & this works as an action Thriller for Grillo like those movies did for them. In this urban Purge world it's scary & you need someone like Grillo to follow on the journey through this crazy new America & he's perfectly cast & you see what a very intense actor he is & what a fantastic Action Hero he can & should be!!! The movie is so atmospheric & exciting & full of danger especially when Grillo has to help a small group of survivor's through the dangerous streets of Los Angeles & the cinematography is stunning,the look if the streets & the colours look beautiful lots of almost neon green it looks fantastic & like i said having the excellent Grillo as the hero is perfect casting he really is so cool like a modern Mad Max or The Punisher he's great!!!A John Carpenter feel is present & a tense vibe throughout make this an exciting scary Thriller.The night time look & cinematography is stunning & the desolate lonely streets at night give a chilling dangerous atmosphere & feels like Escape from New York territory at Times with a hint of The Warriors.",The Purge - Anarchy
63,andrewchristianjr,BETTER.,7,28 October 2021,"This sequel accomplishes much of what the original failed to do. While giving a great commentary on very real issues in America such as poverty and classism, the film gives a better look at The Purge inside of a city instead of confining audiences to a single home like the original film. It still fails to be scary whatsoever and continues to rely on cheap predictable jump scares, but it is a improvement on the first in the series.",The Purge - Anarchy

65,TdSmth5,Much improved but less horror,8,1 November 2014,"It's a couple of hours before this year's purge. A couple about to break up are driving for some reason into downtown LA when their car breaks down. Earlier they had a run-in with some creepy purgers getting ready. A diner server goes home to her daughter who watches videos by some revolutionary anti-purge guy, and her father is ill and she doesn't have enough money for the pills. A guy gets all prepped with weapons and drives around when the purge begins.At this point the creepy guys chase the couple around downtown LA. The woman and her daughter find out that the dad sold himself as a martyr to some 1%ers so they can purge. Suddenly their building is stormed by some paramilitary unit. When they're about be put in a truck, the loner guy sees the scene and decides to rescue them. At that point the couple hides inside his car. Now the 5 of them will try to make it across a couple of blocks to a friend of the server. Of course the car gets shot up and they have to walk. Eventually they make to the house where people are friendly but there is some rivalry between two sister, one of which flips out and purges on the other sister.For no good reason that makes the 5 leave the building just as the paramilitary unit arrives again. As they make their escape they are caught by the creeps. They sell them to a bunch of 1%ers who are bidding on a chance to purge on these people. Then they are released in some camp where they are hunted by the 1%ers.It's good to see a sequel improve dramatically on the original. The Purge: Anarchy takes things to the streets instead of confining us inside a house. That makes things actually more tense because you never know how may appear at a corner or who is up on a roof playing sniper. It did become though in the process less of a horror movie and more of an action thriller. It also has the interesting aspect of a counter-revolution of those who are against the purge but also happen to use violent means. It also sticks it to 1%ers. And it politicizes it all by pointing out that purges are meant to eliminate the poor. But of course Hollywood can't do without bringing up the race issue, so of course all the bad guys are white and all the good guys aren't.This movie also gets a bit more preachy about violence. But as expected, Hollywood is completely blind to its own involvement in creating America's culture of violence. Aside from the weapons industry no one benefits more from selling violence, gore, and brutality than Hollywood.",The Purge - Anarchy
66,aidanratesmovies,"Better than the first, but still not great",7,19 January 2021,"Although it's not as bad as its predecessor, nor is it terrible, The Purge: Anarchy is a dark and overserious little thriller- that is able to tap some of the potential of its interesting concept- but not all of it. First off, and this really goes without saying, but Frank Grillo is an awesome lead in this movie. From generic characters aside, he fully embraces his revenge-filled role and actually gives the audience something to root for, and even something to care about. The worst part of this film is easily the beginning, a stretched out and pointless backstory for our troubled and poorly written characters, and it's just not fun to watch. Not to mention the overserious tones of drama arched over those scenes, as well as a few others throughout, find the film hard to take seriously. It sounds weird to say, but maybe when making these films, don't try to be so serious, because it just ends up feeling gruelling and dull, rather than the fun it can be. The cinematography is still annoying, and there is a few weaker moments post exposition. However, there is quite a few cool little action scenes with Grillo that truly do make the film a lot better. In the end, The Purge: Anarchy is one of those rare sequels that improves upon the original. It's far from perfect, with more capable hands behind the screen it could have been something more, but in the end, it's a fine film, and we may just have to leave it at that.
My Rating: 7/10",The Purge - Anarchy
67,a_chinn,The Purge world is expanded in this more action oriented (and less horror focused) sequel,7,3 August 2018,"America. 2023. Unemployment is below 5%. 
Crime is virtually non-existent while every year fewer and fewer people live below the poverty line. 
All thanks to... The Purge: Anarchy.As with the first film, ""The Purge: Anarchy"" has an irresistible set-up with one day a year where all criminal activity, including murder, is legal, all done in the name of some sort of societal catharsis that has given the nation record low unemployment and record economic growth. Just as with the first film, there's no way anyone can watch this movie without wondering what they would do during one of these horrible annual purges. Would you hunker down and protect your family and property? Would you go wild in the streets? Would you enact revenge over a petty grievance? However, also as with the first film, the story that ends up on screen is a disappointingly routine and does not live up to the film's killer premiss. The first film ended up a well done home invasion/siege film with horror tinges. This sequel opens up the world of The Purge by following a group of disparate characters who find themselves out in the open in a big city the night of a Purge. The general story is that a single mother and teen daughter find themselves out on the street after being attacked by their landlord and then nearly kidnapped by a mysterious organized forced when they're saved by a muscle car-driving Frank Grillo, who's out looking for some of his own personal revenge. Grillo also finds himself protecting another young couple who's car broke down on their way home (never mind why anyone would go to the store right before The Purge is about to begin, although this film is not the type of movie where you poke holes in logic because it's way too easy and ruins the fun). If the first film was basically a horror version of ""Assault on Precinct 13"" this sequel is a horror version of ""The Warriors,"" with our band of heroes having to bop their way through vicious roving gangs in a series of exciting incidents to survive. ""Judgement Night"" might also be an apt comparison and there's a dash of ""The Running Man"" in there too with some dystopian government conspiracy elements thrown in. This sequel delves a bit more into the subtext of The Purge by playing up the class warfare elements of the concept. One character fighting against The Purge says ""Change only comes when their blood spills"" referring to hunting down the wealthy who think their money and power can protect them from the anarchy in the streets. This widening of the world of The Purge makes it superior to the original. While the worldbuilding is interesting, most of the film is unfortunately a series of action set-pieces that end with Grillo telling everyone to ""Keep moving!"" I wish the film had contained more scenes like one where the group takes refuge in a friend's apartment in what starts as a friendly dinner party and provides them with a rare moment of calm. That's when writer/director James DeMonaco masterfully builds tension that climaxes when one of the apartment residents pulls a gun and the seemingly normal dinner party goes berserk. This scene is a microcosm of the entire world of The Purge and is wonderfully executed by DeMonaco. If only the rest of the film were this good. Still, although the story is disappointingly routine action film, it's well executed and never boring. DeMonaco fills the screen with memorably frightening visuals, whether it's the many masked killers roaming the street or a haunting image of a woman drenched in blood eerily standing motionless on a street corner, he captures glimpses a frightening world of lawless anarchy that does not seem all that far removed from our reality (if only the main story was as horrific). And I love the sirens sound effects announcing the start of The Purge are wonderfully frightening, partially because of the excellent sound design, but also because of the great build-up to the lawless purge, sounding as if they're biblical horns announcing the end of times. This sequel also has a cool cameo by a character from the first film, which connects the two seemingly disparate stories. Overall, while I still feel that the final product doesn't live up to the brilliant premiss, ""The Purge: Anarchy"" is entertaining, fast paced, and never boring. Just go into this film expecting more of an action film and less of a horror film.",The Purge - Anarchy
68,Seraphion,Nice move from the original The Purge (2013),7,29 July 2014,"One year after the last annual purge, it's now in 2023. The movie begins in showing alternately the five main characters. They're Leo, who's arming himself to purge; Eva, a waitress, who's going home after work and later meets Cali, her daughter; and the couple who are splitting, Liz and Shane. Leo drives out in an armored sedan to his purge destination. But when he passed Eva and Cali's place and sees them being forcefully taken, Leo steps out and helps them. After their car gets tampered with badly, Liz and Shane runs from a group of purgers, and eventually hides on Leo's car while he's saving Eva and Cali. The five then travel together on foot after Leo's car broke down, and Eva promising a replacement car if he takes them to Tanya, Eva's friend. On the road the other four are in tow while Leo takes point protecting them from purgers.At Tanya's the group treat Shane shoulder that gets on their way there. When Leo asks for the car promised for him, Eva admits that Tanya has no car. Tanya's sister suddenly kills Tanya and tries to kill his husband, stating she knows of the both them cheating on her. Leo kills the two of them after the husband takes Liz as hostage. The group then leave Tanya's but is quickly captured by one of the purger group hunting them since they met at Eva's building. The purgers take them to a building where they're then treated as prey on a 'hunting ground' for wealthy people to purge on. Leo manages to take out five of the seven hunting purgers when they wealthy people call reinforcements which then kills Shane. As the group gets pinned down, suddenly the odds turn as Carmelo's anti-purge group storms the place. As the group leaves, Liz chooses to stay and purge to avenge Shane.Leo, taking Eva and Cali with him, then goes to his purge target's house. Even as Eva and Cali talks him to forgive his target, Leo sets out leaving them in the car. Moments later Leo leaves the target's house and gets shot in the chest. He still survives and the shooter, the Big Daddy whose group Leo saved Eva and Cali from, talks to him. As Big Daddy cocks his gun for the killing shot, he's then shot by Leo's target, who turns out to be spared by Leo. Big Daddy's men close in on the house but the siren signaling the end of the purge rings. The movie ends with Eva, Cali and Leo's target driving Leo to a hospital.I quite liked the first movie for it's unique premise f 'releasing one's beast' for 12 hours and all the consequences. And this time, this movie made the nice transition from a single location focus to an adventure like scenario. The focus change also successfully encompass the move from the upper middle class citizens to the lower middle class, from the family centered story to a group of strangers banded together forcefully by situation.The flow is nicer now, as the thriller aspect doesn't really focus on the quiet situations now, instead the thriller and shocks can occur even at the start of the movie, in a not so quiet situations. The action is better here, in more diverse situations ranging from indoors, on the street, and even subway tunnels. The conflicts portrayed in this movie develops better from the original movie. This time it's not just one main conflict that's in focus, rather the movie presents a few conflicts are put on hold while the main characters are kept busy surviving.The acting is quite an average overall. Frank Grillo does show his level in action role, and shows good use of his facial expressions and voice tone. The other four characters unfortunately show not a very satisfying performance, just like any performance you'd see on C class horrors.My final say that despite it's shortcomings, The Purge: Anarchy (2014) deserves a 7 out of 10 score. A recommendation to see is just an okay from me, although I'd recommend better movies",The Purge - Anarchy
69,rgkarim,Improvement with Anarchy,7,19 July 2014,"Last year we were introduced to the Purge, a thriller that slightly strayed from the typical path by diving into the world of legalized crime. Yes you heard me legalized crime, where for 12 hours: theft, sexual assault and even murder are free of punishment in an attempt to reduce crime as a whole. The first installment into this series, attempted to scare us with a locked down, dark house and a bunch of crazed rich people. Unfortunately for this reviewer, the movie was rather boring, a bit stupid, and lacked a lot of suspense until near the end when the action unfolded and the moral filled dialogue took a back seat. So to my surprise, the announcement of a sequel was quite shocking, and I wondered just what was in store. From the trailers, The Purge Anarchy showed some more bite than it's predecessor, as this time the danger was taken out of the isolated home and on to the wild streets of the most deadly night of the year. Did it deliver? Yes for the most part, as the Purge opens with three stories each from a different perspective of this night of terror: the hunted, the innocent, and the purger. In a random, and conveniently timed manner, their stories link up, as they become a band of mice escaping the various nut jobs out on the street. Within the first twenty minutes or so, the movie has much more suspense than what we saw, as the group of characters begins to partake in the most dangerous game of survival. Each of the cast is ""unique"" in their own way, with the Sergeant (Frank Grillo) being the cold, withdrawn elite who leads the other four weaklings through the darkness. The rest of the cast does a nice job of portraying various states of mind in a situation, yet their characters for the most part are annoying. In particular is Cali (Zoë Soul) who is the active and verbal moral speaker of the group sharing her opinions every step of the way, and overstepping her boundaries. While I appreciate the morals she is presenting and strongly believe in them, her little attitude was very annoying and I waited for some event to put her in her place. Yet it never really came. The other characters in the small party evolved over the night, developing backbones and courage to fight back in the night and not be pathetic. Cali though, stayed stubbornly naïve and annoying. Okay let's move past the characters and get to the rest of the movie. Anarchy's story is a continuation of the Purge's simplistic plot, adding more insight into the government that blessed this event. While a few of the plot elements are rather lackluster and emotionally deprived, they have set up a common enemy to unite against instead of random crazy strangers. The mystery behind a few of the factions is well timed, dragged on just long enough to keep you wondering, but not so long that you stop caring, helped by the less than 2 hour running time. One continues to ask why this small band of people are wanted by so many, keeping the suspense and thrills up. What also helps is that our cast is not the usual pathetic weaklings we see in horror films, but actually have skills that allow them to survive. The Sergeant in particular uses street smarts, hunter's intuition, and gun wielding to fight off those that choose to purge, leading to sporadic action scenes that liven up the film. Navigating the diverse nightmarish city also keeps things exciting as the band is forced to take detours and migrate from as the hunter's traps and tricks come to life. Some of these obstacles attempt to scare you with predictable tactics we've seen time and time again. However, most of these jumping scenes quickly change into a struggle of dominance, often leading to a pileup of victims as the hours progress. While most of the victims often erupt into a shower of bloody ruptures, the kills aren't quite as graphic or torturous as what we've seen in the past. The thing that really gets overused is the F word, which seems to be the most popular sentence filler these days, as every bout of dialogue leads to a heated use of the word. Perhaps the other adult aspect of this movie is the how soulless and twisted society has become in this movie, where emotional scandals and pent up anger is unhealthily released in sinful actions. Now older audience members are going to laugh at half of the motives, and some of the cheesy lines associated with it. Younger audience members though, may fall victim to the suggestions of this movie, so please reconsider taking them to the theater. The Purge Anarchy is a much better movie than I had expected, and improved miraculously from the first installment. With improved action, a better setting, and some dynamic characters, this series shows promise for the inevitable sequel that is to come. Yes there are still some overstretches, particularly in the blood, dialogue, and story, but I a film series like this one begins to expect that. Fans of the series or those looking for a decent suspense thriller should check it out; otherwise take five on this weekend. My scores for the Purge Anarchy are as followed:Action/Horror/Thriller: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5",The Purge - Anarchy
70,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Expands its view from the original,6,30 December 2014,"The year 2013 had a curiously captivating idea introduced into its horror genre. The launch of The Purge (2013) attracted many people to the theaters due to their eager nature to see the kind of macabre acts that could happen if such an event were real. The premise was unique and intriguing but the end result was not what people expected or received. Instead of seeing this concept being fully exploited, the production crew gave its viewers a very average film with stock characters with inhumane personalities, generic violence and standard execution. But like many other films that did well at the box office (even with bad reviews), managed to obtain a sequel. However unlike most sequels, this installment actually improves upon the original. It's not vastly refreshing but it does have better qualities than its predecessor.If a viewer has seen the first film, a good guess can be inferred on what this one will be about. Instead of continuing the story on its beginning characters, writer/director James DeMonaco focuses on a new set of characters (quite honestly that's fine, not many liked the original characters). All of which start as different character threads of which different people become apart of the annual purge, whether they expected to or not. What works with having separate story lines is that they come together as one, rather quickly. This keeps the story moving not only in maintaining audiences' attentions but also by physical location. In place of having the setting focused on one household, DeMonaco now directs the viewers' attention to the world outside where this annual ""holiday"" happens nationwide. Accompanying that is Jacques Jouffret's cinematography, which enlarges his viewfinder to get better panning shots of the disarray happening around the main characters.The characters that we look at are of different areas and situations. Frank Grillo plays a man out for vengeance after his son was killed. Notably, Grillo kind of looks and acts (a little) like The Punisher. I could only imagine what a field day The Punisher would have on this day! But I digress. Carmen Ejogo and Zoë Soul play a mother and daughter duo who end up being saved by Grillo's character. Zach Gilford and Kiele Sanchez play a couple who becomes stranded at the beginning of the purge. When all these characters finally meet up together, it is their determination that makes them likable. In fact, they even help each other develop which is important in this kind of movie, where morals are highly advised when it comes to the legalization of murder. Even Edwin Hodge (the victim from the last movie) has a brief cameo along with Michael Kenneth Williams who both play rebels against the purge. They are both very welcome to fight back.Unsuccessfully, the film still does not overcome much else. The writing incorporates multiple subplots. Some of which pertain to the main characters, where either it is concluded and has no effect on the plot or isn't concluded and felt irrelevant to begin with. There's also a subplot about government conspiracies where it is partially addressed and then left alone with giant plot holes that make no sense. When people complained about the violence being too generic from the first, apparently nobody heard them because nothing is exactly fixed there either. People are still beating the crap out of each other with the simplest and common of weapons. If this is the night of legal violence, then get creative! Use something different! The only true scary element to this movie is how sadistic various people are depicted and the beliefs they hold to this event.Giving your buddy a thumbs up or a fist bump because they get the chance to blow someone's head off or dismember them is god awfully sick. It should make the viewer excessively happy when these perverse people are put in their place. It is so gratifying. It's also strange because as the confrontations continue from beginning to end, they seem to become less and less personal, which is kind of what I thought the purge was all about. But to watch these weirdos say their wicked holy prayer before butchering somebody is just plain fiendish. However going back to the last flaw, Nathan Whiehead's musical score again fails to compel. The composition is loaded with electronic pulses and ticking percussion to emphasize tension but in the end it's not the best listening experience for music collectors. It is an improvement in different areas but still not spectacular entertainment.Writer/director James DeMonaco did make some noticeable revisions to this installment compared to the first entry. This time it has likable characters with the right development, better casting and moments that do make the purge look even more sick than before. Yet, it still suffers from the clichéd surrounding violence, unimportant subplots and a tiresome musical score.",The Purge - Anarchy

72,begob,"Good idea, bad story",5,14 December 2014,"Pretty good pace, zero subtlety.This needs to be more crazy and satirical, like Robocop. But in the end we just get a straight story of ethics delivered in brutal terms. The issues are kind of teased out through the annoying questioning of a young girl, and the scenes of the rich at play are like something out of an '80s music video.There was a lot of potential in the apartment scene, when the work colleague takes them in. But instead of a relentless & weird scene of needless violence, like in Tarantino or Lynch, it just ends as a domestic shooting and doesn't seem relevant to the story.The most important thing is that big budget movies are having a go at questioning why a US dominated by big corporations has gone so badly wrong since the '70s. Elysium was the latest, but that was just as bad on subtlety as this.Here's an idea for the next episode: the state contracts out its torturing requirements to a corporation run by a pair of con-men, who then pick anyone who fits the profile and shove food up their arses.

That now can finally appeal to the masses, and hemorrhage this stupid amount of sequels. Enjoy the buttery pop corn folks...",The Purge - Anarchy
74,Screen_Blitz,A slight and darker step forward from the first Purge,7,10 June 2016,"It was the summer of 2013 when James DeMonoco introduced audiences everywhere new and profound idea and brought to the silver screen. The results were not great but brought fair amount of appeal. Nowadays, many movies that score a major fortune at the box office become a target for a sequel, regardless of how well the film leaves an open door for a second installment. Although a sequel to 'The Purge' is not necessary, it's not terrible one either. After all, there are plenty of grounds that the first installment never set its foot in. Like the predecessor, this film is set in the near-future on the night of the annual Purge, the one night of the year when crime is legalized and all of law enforcement is suspended for twelve hours. Instead of revolving around a single nuclear family, this plot follows three groups of individuals including Shane (played by Zach Gilford) and Liz (played by Kiele Sanchez), a young squabbling couple who's car breaks down on the highway during the commencement of the Purge; waitress Eva Sanchez (played by Carmen Ejogo) and her daughter Cali (played by Zoe Soul), and police sergeant (played by Frank Grillo) who seeks the avenge the murder of his son. When these groups are unexpectedly caught out in the open city during the opening minutes of the Purge, they must band together and fight for their survival as they come across violent bandits and other corrupt individuals who are out to purge, until the night is over. Though this movie doesn't completely solve the dilemmas the first film endured, it is driven with a slightly more quality script and presents more thrills than what we last experienced. Instead of generating an home invasion plot and centering on a claustrophobic atmosphere, it expands among the setting by showcasing more suspense as well as more violent action. This includes scenes of tense gunfights (with more blood) and foot chases down the streets This film succeeds at formulating better thrills and a sense of realism when dealing with its ""legal crime"" concept. Thanks to this, it doesn't feel like its rehashing the same worn-out formula we've already seen. Although some of the suspense falls short in some sequences, the atmosphere signals a fair step forward from what we saw in the last movie. In other words, the intensity is little more palpable and gives viewers a true feeling what our characters are experiencing. In addition, the casts give off some terrific performances. While Frank Grillo's character the police sergeant stands three- dimensional, the rest of the characters feel underdeveloped to where you may not come to care for them. In the end, the police serves almost as the pinnacle of the plot. The Purge: Anarchy shows some fair improvement upon the first film, and ends with a satisfying appeal. Though the script is clunky in a few areas, it manages to overcome most of its flaws through more quality suspense and a more intense atmosphere. This movie serves well and certainly something recommended for everyone looking for a good thriller.",The Purge - Anarchy
75,cricket30,Spring cleaning in America . . .,8,24 July 2014,". . . (not to be confused with THE PRODUCERS' ""Springtime for Hitler"") always runs March 21-22 in the United States of the Tea Party. PURGE 2: ANARCHY covers the Sixth Purge, occurring in 2023, after Democrats have been swept from office in the 2014 and 2016 elections. In my opinion, continuous ""anarchy"" would have begun with the onset of the (never-ending) First Purge. Then each of America's 300 million guns (as of the 2010 Census) would have claimed at least a couple lives, wiping out not only most of the U.S. population, but the majority of Canada's and Mexico's, as well (the ""spill-over effect,"" in reverse). PURGE 2 shows that American economic disparity is the main threat to our Civilization. When broke people don't have adequate fire power they feel insecure, causing them to scratch and claw the weapons away from the less cunning, nimble, and physically weaker wealthy One Per Centers. That's why it's in Society's best interest to assist the poor in obtaining all the firearms they need to feel comfortable (which is a much greater necessity for them than food or clothes).

77,IonicBreezeMachine,A marked improvement upon the first Purge film anchored by a strong lead in Frank Grillo and some fun throwbacks to 70s and 80s exploitation.,7,24 September 2021,"Set in Los Angeles on Purge Night in the year 2023, a group of ordinary working-class citizens consisting of waitress Eva (Carmen Ejogo) and her teenage daughter Cali (Zoë Soul) and estranged married couple Shane (Zach Gilford) and Liz (Kiele Sanchez) find themselves fighting for their lives when through chance they encounter one another while fleeing both the Purger gangs and heavily armed paramilitary squads whose affiliation and purpose are unknown. The group is saved by an armed unnamed stranger (Frank Grillo) who becomes their reluctant protector but is out on Purge Night looking for a specific target who wronged him. Meanwhile a group of anti-purgers lead by the charismatic and enigmatic Carmelo Jones (Michael K. Williams) is gathering support in the working class communities fueled by the anger and resentment at the wealthy elite and the New Founding Fathers of America.When the first The Purge film was released in 2013, the film was financially successful thanks to its small budget and a strong marketing campaign that conveyed its high concept but very ridiculous premise but audience and critical reception was rather middling with many complementing the attempted satire and ambition of The Purge, while lamenting its boring, bland non sensical characters and long sequences of characters stumbling around in darkened hallways. A sequel was greenlit almost immediately after The Purge's massive opening weekend and was produced so quickly that it came out just over a year after the first one in Summer 2014. The Purge: Anarchy still isn't water type with its social commentary (although its better explored and utilized) but in terms of sheer entertainment value this is a decent attempt at low budget action schlock that brings to mind memories of the likes of The Exterminator, The Warriors, and Escape from New York.The movie makes a major improvement from the first film by giving us infinitely more interesting characters. While the financially struggling family or estranged married couple aren't unfamiliar types for films like this, the group is well cast and feel like actual characters who have a level of likability unlike the ""types"" on display in the first movie that the actors felt like they were working against rather than with. The characters are likable enough and have enough presence to give meat to the story. There's also some good supporting work in the purgers and anti-purgers, especially in a more than welcome appearance by Michael K. Williams as Carmelo Jones whose character hacks the Purge feed and rouses the public against the New Founding Fathers and The Purge in a charismatic and energize performance that makes him believable as a grassroots leader. But by far the biggest asset in the film's favor is Frank Grillo as the armed stranger (credited as Sergeant) who becomes our characters' reluctant protector. Grillo brings his usual badass anti-hero appeal to the role and makes for a protagonist who's simultaneously easy to root for, but also carries barely contained rage and live wire intensity that can go off at a moments notice. It's made clear the reason he's out on Purge Night is to seek revenge and he intends to get it by any means necessary.The Purge: Anarchy's budget has been tripled from its predecessor, and how feels much grander in scope and ambition. While in the first Purge we only ever heard about the large scale purges second hand through radio broadcasts played over the ending credits without actually being shown anything, in Anarchy's case we're given what was only teased at in the first film. While the movie is still very budget conscious with lots of empty streets and only a handful of distinct purgers (at least through most of the movie) the movie feels like a relic of bygone days of guerilla action flicks of the 70s and 80s where dystopian action films and vigilante films were made on the cheap but making up for their lack of budget with sheer grit and intensity. The action beats in Anarchy are fantastic with nice establishment of spatial geography, actors who look like they can handle themselves (especially Grillo), and some great impactful payoff with every gunshot, bludgeon, or strike conveyed with full force. The movie maybe undermines itself by not picking off many of its main cast (a tactic used in films like Aliens or Warriors to keep audiences on edge) and I think it's because the central group is too small and maybe should have had some extra people to serve as kill fodder to unsettle the balance.The Purge: Anarchy expands on the previous films ridiculous premise by playing to its strengths and going for pure Cannon Films level action excess. With a strong lead in Frank Grillo whose intensity harkens back to anti-hero staples like Steve McQueen and Charles Bronson, to creative action beats and Purge Night insanity, The Purge delivers on the intriguing premise only barely hinted at in its predecessor.",The Purge - Anarchy

79,hnt_dnl,"Immensely entertaining, provocative sequel!",8,19 July 2014,"Right off the bat, I will say that I I'm one of the few movie-goers that actually liked ""The Purge"". Given the relative star power and production quality of that film versus the (unfairly) low rating on this site, one would think it's the worst film ever made, and it was far from that. I think the concept of the purge is extremely interesting. But I think that many viewers disliked the claustrophobic home invasion plot, as it is certainly not an original premise. I had to re-watch the film multiple times to really appreciate the nuances and solid social commentary it offered up. Also, from the first viewing, I thought the performances from Ethan Hawke, Lena Headey, and Edwin Hodge were uniformly outstanding. Currently, 'The Purge' has a sub-6.0 rating, which is way TOO LOW!With this arguably more entertaining sequel THE PURGE:ANARCHY (2014), the stakes are raised. Instead of the claustrophobic high-tech home setting of a rich family, this sequel is set in a gritty, urban location in an unnamed metropolis and the bulk of the action takes place outdoors. Also, instead of a rich ""perfect"" family, the movie's main characters are all a variety lower class people with real problems, either financial or personal. So I think people took more to this one as they could relate more. But the original should get it's due for setting things in motion.""The Purge:Anarchy"" is a very involving tale, as it deftly overlaps then converges 3 separate stories: (1) A hard-hearted vengeful loner whose name is left a mystery (excellently played by Frank Grillo) out to avenge the death of his son by a drunk driver, (2) an hard- working waitress named Eva (superbly performed by Carmen Ejogo) trying to survive the harsh life in the projects raising her militant, vocal teen daughter Cali (well played by Zoe Soul), and finally a feuding yuppie couple named Liz and Shane (solidly played by Kiele Sanchez and Zach Gilford). I think the fact that this movie did not feature big-name stars worked wonders, as huge stars would have undercut the film's focus, potency, and message. Seeing a bunch of essentially unknown actors struggle through the tortuous purge night actually adds weight to the proceedings. The interactive chemistry of these 5 protagonists is strong and really carries the film.A main draw of this sequel is it's gritty, urban setting. In the original film, we as viewers were limited in that we only saw what happened in that one home. In this sequel, from the perspective of the film's 5 protagonists, we get to see tangible evidence of the purge in the form of various chaotic scenes of people purging relentlessly, either for revenge, to make a statement, or just for their own malicious amusement, as the group tries to maneuver their way through the streets to safety. There's a more dynamic, interactive quality to this sequel that is refreshing.In terms of characters, I feel the same way about the 2 main stars of this one as I do the original. In 'The Purge', I loved Hawke and Headey's strong lead performances. Also, here, the two main stars Grillo and Ejogo delivered the best performances, convincingly evoking empathy for their characters' respective plights. The difference, though, is that unlike 'The Purge' that had a strong 3rd performance by Hodge, 'Anarchy' suffers from having weaker supporting characters as no one approaches the level of Grillo or Ejogo. The film also sports a breakneck pace, but when there are stalls in the action, the conversations are persuasive. Also, I really like how the film transitions the characters from one dangerous, difficult situation to another and there's a built-in excuse with the purge being the reason. As the film moves along, you'll find yourself feeling more and more empathetic towards the main 5 rooting them all to victory.

81,petra_ste,An improved sequel; still not good,5,1 February 2015,"I'll say this in favor of The Purge 2: at least it does make use of its dystopian premise - unlike the previous movie, which dangled it in front of viewers in the first act only to yank it away and dish out the umpteenth home invasion thriller.Bad news? It's still not that great. Near-future: in Los Angeles, a ragtag bunch of protagonists - including a revenge-bent soldier, a mother with her daughter and a couple on the verge of break-up - strives to reach safety while facing multiple attackers during the One Night When Crime Is Legal. Much like Snowpiercer, the premise is compelling on the surface but makes no sense whatsoever when you think about it for more than five seconds. Why would any government allow that? Even forgetting the horrific moral implications, how would it *help* economy - as we are repeatedly told - with the kind of apocalyptic damages depicted here? I am not one of those moviegoers always complaining about ""plot holes"" but, if sci-fi writers want to be taken seriously, they need to give their ridiculous stuff a little more thought than that (see also: Looper, Snowpiercer). Not everyone can be Asimov, but come on.A few effective sequences - including the ending, which is a little obvious but still much better than the ridiculous coda of the first movie - are eclipsed by heavy-handed moralizing: people are horrible, the big fish eats the little fish, and yada yada yada. As Philip K. Dick taught, social commentary in sci-fi sauce is best served with barbed irony than with finger-wagging. Here, we have an auction with fat cat suits purchasing blue-collar victims to slaughter. Subtle, huh?However, the trend is a positive one. With this kind of progression, The Purge 4 might turn out to be fine, and The Purge 7 some kind of masterpiece.5/10",The Purge - Anarchy
82,bryank-04844,"The Purge 2: Anarchy' better than the first film? Yes, it is, but take it all with a grain of salt.",5,15 August 2015,"A year later, we are out on the scary and violent streets rather than in the confines of a big home with the sequel to last year's big box office hit 'The Purge' with 'The Purge: Anarchy'. Writer/Director James DeMonaco concocted a brilliant and chaotic story where we are set in the very near future where the U.S. constitution is done away with and a few select people were put in charge and called The Founding Fathers. These Founding Fathers re-wrote a new constitution that added in a new law where once a year for a twelve hour period, everyone was entitled to ""Purge"", where all forms of crime were legal, including rape and murder.It was a way for people to cleanse themselves for short period of time of anger and frustration. The Founding Fathers say that since the 'Purge' has been in affect, there is virtually no crime for the remainder of the year and unemployment is at an all-time low. But there is something more sinister at work here as DeMonaco laid the undertone of the class system where the rich will always triumph over the poor. In the first film, we are trapped in the confines of a big house of a wealthy family who just want to stay inside and keep safe from the people who are ""purging"", but it soon becomes a home invasion flick when a band of young wealthy people show up on the doorstep and try to kill everyone.And there was always annoying undertone of the class system, which never really got off the ground. But in this sequel, we are out on the big bad streets during 'The Purge', which is a big improvement on the last film. We get to see all the types of people, gangs, and posses that feel the need to kill and rape everything in their path to ""cleanse"" themselves. Not only do we get to witness the killings, but we get to be a part of the escape and a part of others who are not necessarily killing people, but kidnapping people for money and delivering them to their would-be killers. But once again, DeMonaco sets the tone with the whole rich vs. poor again.This time, taking it further as to start an form of an anarchist group (hence the sequel title), that sends viral videos of their leader (Michael K. Williams), discussing how the rich people of America set this 'Purge' law in motion to get rid of the poor people of society. And as to hit us over the head several times during the film, we see a group of good people who are forced out onto the mean city streets as the Purge begins. They must stay together and defend themselves against all attackers. But during their real nightmare, they come to realize that the Anarchist leader is speaking the truth and the the rich and powerful have much uglier and sinister plans for the poor people of America.This class system undertone has a little more meat to it, but it's so over-the-top, that it becomes unbelievable and very laughable. Once again, if DeMonaco just stuck with the actual 'Purge' event, the film would be much better, because the scenes where our group is being terrorized and attacked is genuinely frightening. Is 'The Purge 2: Anarchy' better than the first film? Yes, it is, but take it all with a grain of salt.",The Purge - Anarchy

I'm sure many critics and audiences were surprised when the modestly budgeted $3 million horror flick made almost $90 million in its theatrical run. I found the first movie to be a thrilling study in one of the most frightening concepts a devious mind could come up with for a countrywide ""holiday."" ""The Purge: Anarchy"" takes the concept to a whole other level.Where the first film kept audiences in the confines of one home, ""The Purge: Anarchy"" puts us out in the streets of the big city where a group of characters must rely on each other to stay alive through the night. It's a journey through madness as the group of survivors makes their way through the deadly streets, alleys, and subways of the metropolis. It becomes all too apparent that nowhere is safe on this terrifying and vengeful night.While it's the natural progression from the first movie to the sequel, I can't help but feel it lost a certain personal charm the confines of one home and its family provided. That being said, the characters are brought together quite sensibly and in a manner that is believable even if it does seem convenient at times. They're well-established and give you some personality to latch onto and become emotionally involved with.""The Purge: Anarchy"" reminded me of ""Judgment Night"" in the beginning. Everybody is running around the streets trying to survive one attack after the next. However, it switches gears and starts getting a bit political as it strays into territory explored previously in Jonathan Swift's ""A Modest Proposal"" and an independent film recently released entitled ""Butcher Boys."" It was written and produced by ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" co-creator Kim Henkel and explores the different classes humanity is broken into and how they treat each other.When first taking it all in, ""The Purge: Anarchy"" seems to have trouble figuring out where it stands or what it's trying to say morally. What I came up with was that guns don't kill people. People kill people. That sounds like a rally cry for the NRA and Republicans everywhere. On the flipside, I felt another politically correct message was being given. It doesn't matter why or who you kill. It's still killing and still wrong. Both ideas have their merits.'""The Purge: Anarchy"" is rated R for strong disturbing violence and for language. Honestly, the movie is nowhere near as graphic as it could've been. People get shot, stabbed, beaten, and ran over. It's really no worse than anything we've seen in any of ""The Expendables"" movies.I couldn't help but snicker at a few scenes in ""The Purge: Anarchy."" Producer Jason Blum is seriously obsessed with the ""found footage"" concept. Every movie the guy has worked on finds a way to fit shaky-cam shots somewhere. Here we get a cam mounted on a motorcycle filming the driver as he races around the city. There's also surveillance, night vision, security, and traffic light footage people use to track their victims as they scramble around on the streets.""The Purge: Anarchy"" doesn't quite live up to its predecessor. At the same time, it is entertaining and keeps the audience's attention through it's fast-paced energy and edge-of-your-seat thrills. It gives people who wanted to see more of what went on in the cities exactly what they craved. I'm just wondering how they're going to follow this one up next year.",The Purge - Anarchy
84,anselmdaniel,"Higher budget, higher quality?",6,25 July 2020,"This review contains spoilers.The Purge: Anarchy is the sequel to the The Purge. It is directed by James DeMonaco and stars new cast of characters that try to survive the purge. The story follows multiple perspectives, from a cop out for revenge, a couple that is stranded, to a mother and daughter deep in the city. These plot lines converge and lead to the cop protecting the others.The Purge: Anarchy has a higher budget which it uses to employ more extras and effects. There is absolutely a more grander feel to this movie and it can be felt that a city has gone crazy. That is all that is positive about this movie.The problems with the writing in the first movie remain except that it is only exacerbated with the budget. More ludicrous events will take place on the screen to increase the body count. There is a scene midway through the movie where it explains that the government is seeking out poor areas to increase the deaths caused by the purge. This event is hard to believe as the survivors and even people in the city can film them. It is difficult to believe that the government could be sending full military armed forces to kill poor citizens. Even upon losing a truck, no one suspects or even brings up the overkill the government is doing to the population. The same plot holes such as vacation outside of the United States are not even hand waved here. None of the movie's internal logic makes sense, especially with gangs kidnapping people for the rich to have a gladiator game. These are interesting scenes, but are not fulfilling.The other parts of this movie such as directing, editing, and acting range from bland to decent. Frank Grillo as the police officer is the standout performance here. The rest of the movie's mentioned components are not great.The audience that would like this movie most is one that is willing to heavily suspend their disbelief. A large suspension is needed to simply enjoy the action which is decently shot and choreographed here. My only wish for this movie is that there should have been more commentary. Much of the backstory and politics of this alternate United States is not told through the characters. It is only given by narration. With a lot of tweaks, this series could have been better but now it is only mindless entertainment.I do not recommend The Purge: Anarchy.Grade: D",The Purge - Anarchy
85,virek213,THE PURGE Continues...Out Onto The Streets Of L.A.,7,29 July 2014,"As writer/director James DeMonaco's 2013 ""what-if"" futuristic psychological thriller THE PURGE, made on a budget of only $3 million, was such a huge success. It only stood to reason that there would be a follow-up. The basic idea of an entire twelve-hour time frame, from 7 PM March 21st to 7 AM March 22nd, being devoted to everybody releasing their most violent tendencies in a ""purge"", especially against the poor and the indigent, seemed to hit the spot of a time in the year when mega-budget films are usually the big thing, seeing as how it only cost $3 million to make. And here we have THE PURGE: ANARCHY.Now it is the year 2023, and another Purge Night is about to descend on America, though DeMonaco keeps his story focused around Los Angeles. It is getting late in the day on March 21st, and everybody with any sense is preparing to get back to their homes before the Purgers come out for releasing their innermost monsters. But not everyone is ready to heed the advice of the authorities; one man in particular (Frank Grillo) is out to get revenge on the drunk driver who had killed his son in the last Purge twelve months before and had gotten off on a technicality. Then there are four people of different backgrounds who find themselves thrown together. One pair (Zach Gilford; Kiele Sanchez) find themselves stranded on the 6th Street Bridge over the L.A. River after their SUV's cable has been severed by a Purger. The other pair are a mother (Carmen Ejogo) and daughter (Zoe Soul) whose house has been destroyed by another group of Purgers. When they meet up with an extremely reluctant Gilford (who doesn't reveal his motivation for willfully being out there), they are forced to endure an endless night of horrific violence at the hands of various organized Purge crews, and even an anti-Purge group led by an almost Jim Jones-like leader (Michael K. Williams). Ejogo, Gilford, Soul, and Sanchez are basically in Gilford's reluctant hands and just trying to survive, resorting to defensive violence only when forced to, especially at the hands of rich, upscale Beverly Hills purgers who use them for target practice in a ritual seemingly inspired by both the 1933 classic THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME, and the 2011 film THE HUNGER GAMES; and then it comes down to the climax outside the house of the man that Grillo was after in the first place.Whereas the original film took inspiration from a lot of different sources, including ""siege"" films such as ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, THE BIRDS, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, and STRAW DOGS, by extending it out into the streets and involving Purgers of all kinds, from ethnic gang-bangers to those with the original film's ""ghoul"" masks (a premise borrowed from A CLOCKWORK ORANGE), DeMonaco takes inspiration for THE PURGE: ANARCHY from such films as COLORS, DARK BLUE, and THE WARRIORS. There's also the return to the premise of the original, of a fascist New Founding Fathers of America having what passes for ""control"" over everything to do with the Purge, which people like George Orwell, Aldoux Huxley, Franz Kafka, and Rod Serling would have found comfortingly familiar. The camera work is also quite fluid, given that the budget DeMonaco was working with here was still not of a typical Hollywood action film ($9 million). And the HUNGER GAMES-inspired Beverly Hills twist is a good diversion. I only wish that DeMonaco didn't feel the need to make it more palpable to a conventional summer action film audience by throwing in a lot of profanity into his screenplay, as well as violence that reaches extremely graphic and hyperkinetic levels. The premise, though at times absurd, is enough to keep one's attention glued without all the gratuitousness getting in the way.Grillo, Ejogo, Gilford, Sanchez, and Soul do hold one's attention for the film's 105-minute running time; and certain elements from the original (the surveillance cameras; the Orwellian TV screens) wisely survive in the sequel. The ambiguous end, of course, leaves the door open for a possible PURGE III in the not-too-distant future, one in which one hopes the poor and the indigent will fight back against the Purgers. But for the purposes of THE PURGE: ANARCHY, and for all its attendant flaws, the basic Purge premise is enough to sustain.",The Purge - Anarchy

The film starts off decently enough with the story playing out nicely, combining a good deal of action with suspense that gathers in quantity & pace as the film goes on. There's even a really nice build up in tension to the commencement of the Purge in seeing people preparing for both survival & for Purging.The movie has a bit of a Punisher/Mad Max feel to it as well, especially with the Leo Barnes storyline and the two main gangs that are going about....the one after Shane & Liz and the more SWAT-like gang involved with the Eva & Cali storyline. The morality issue of the Purge has been made a part of the story again for this film and with the introduction of an anti-Purge group, it attempts to show that Purging humans isn't the answer to a lot of social problems.The cast of characters are good for the most part, especially Grillo as Leo Barnes, but unfortunately there's the annoying, gobby, know-it-all brat in Cali.

Now it is not usually the case but in this instance the second movie is better than the original.In the first movie we observed a family trying to protect themselves and it was rather effective in portraying them as utterly helpless.The second movie brings together the stories of three sets of people. A mother with her daughter, a young couple and a loner. A man who although is anti-purge sets out to take revenge for the loss of his son. En route he witnesses the hopeless struggle of a mother with her daughter as well as a desolate couple and although they are not his concern, he chooses to assist them. This proves a catalyst for everything that followed.These 12 hours that people are allowed to fully indulge their animal instincts, one can feel sorry for the unfortunate ones who find themselves at their path but at the same time, hopelessness does not have to be ultimate.

Overall, I will say I was disappointed with ""The Purge."" Because of this disappointment, I didn't have high hopes for the sequel; ""The Purge: Anarchy."" However, I quickly found a far more entertaining film than I had anticipated.""The Purge: Anarchy"" isn't a ground-breaking, earth-shattering, re-inventing the wheel type of film but it did feel like it finally took the potential the first film had and ran with it. The story dives deeper into the mythology that was established and further develops it and even offers up some glimpses of back-story and where it's heading. The violence in the film was handled nicely as it never gets too crazy and over-the-top and is kept at a level where it is both shocking and satisfying at the same time. The characters may suffer from being underdeveloped and sometimes their individual stories get pushed into the background but they were still interesting and served a bigger purpose than just being potential body bag fillers for later in the story. Finally, Frank Grillo really leads the charge and is very entertaining as the reluctant hero. He showed me he can play the villain in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" but he shows he has what it takes to be a sympathetic and, more importantly, a tough-as-nails good guy.I went in expecting the worst but got a whole lot better than I expected with this one. The story really got its hooks in me and, while it may get a little silly with the conflict, the seemingly never ending string of bad situations the group finds themselves in while trying to survive the 12 hours where all crime is legal kept the film fresh and interesting for me. ""The Purge: Anarchy"" really found that perfect blend of thrills and action it needed and it definitely proved to be a lot better than I was prepared for. Overall, I found it to be a very entertaining film that never bored me and has actually got me excited for the third film.Hello there, dance machine! My name is Rev.

90,danielmanson,Actually thought this was a good sequel,7,1 November 2020,"I was actually pleasantly surprised by this purge sequel. I took so long to watch it because of how many there now is, so I thought to stop after the first. But I finally jumped on and I thought it was quite good.Some good action scenes, likeable characters and overall just interesting. Don't get me wrong, it's not a film you'll watch and shout and scream about it to your mates, but it's a good evening watch.Few things that annoyed me. The wife of the couple was incredibly annoying throughout, if you watch you'll know why (don't want to say any spoilers). The film follows the same group through the whole night, which is fine, but you know what the ending is going to be, so can feel dragged out at times. But overall it's decent, like I said before it's a fun, almost mindless watch. If you haven't seen it, but seen the first I recommend.",The Purge - Anarchy
91,bbickley13-921-58664,A good sequel because of the differences from the original,8,18 July 2014,"The difference between The Purge and the Purge: Anarchy is similar to the difference between Alien and Aliens. While the original purge was a more enclosed terror, this movie like most sequels is bigger and filled with more action.The original had more depth to the situation, having us try to feel more sympathy with an upper middle class family who made money off the Purge and then became victims of it themselves. Appealing more to the populace, the sequel makes Sympathy easier by dealing with the people the Purge centers upon. Two people who live barely above the 5% poverty line the Purge helps to create. A man who plans too use the purge to seek vengeance on those that took what's most important too him, and two people who just make the perfect victims in any situation. All find themselves in the center of the madness and attempt to survive the night in an homage to Escape from New York.Michael K. Williams brings a Black Panter twist to Omar from the Wire, playing a revolutionary who realizes that bringing the riot too the rich instead of pledging each other is the only way to stop the holiday from continuing. The sequel does have the advantage of being darker. Those rich kids in mask from the original may seem scary, but it was really disturbing watching conversations about how easy going regular people can be about their right to rape and murder one day of the year.Another good sequel for 2014",The Purge - Anarchy
92,frosty-44431,Best Than The First (my opinion),8,8 February 2021,"This one felt like it should have been the first film, it was much more expecting and more wide spread around the city. The fear was even more heightened, and I could watch this over and over.",The Purge - Anarchy
93,abcvision,Rights,9,23 July 2014,"I did not see the first Purge movie so I went into Purge 2 blind. I had seen a few trailers so I know a bit of what it is about. It is really about the golden rule, which is he who has the gold makes the rules. In Purge 2, the time is ticking for an annual ritual when all laws are suspended. For one night society can cleanse itself and if you do partake you can kill rape or whatever you want to get the hostility out of your system. This ""purge"" is sanctioned by the Government and an idea of the new founding fathers. The Sergeant (Frank Grillo) is on a mission to avenge his son's death and is then caught in a dueling situation between a few innocent by standards. This makes him the leader of these lost four and he takes him through the maze of chaos on that night of mayhem. There are some pretty violent intense scenes but the movie kept my interest as the themes dwelled on the social economic divide in society. Sounds like a good idea to be able to vent your frustrations for just one night, but it all depends on which side of the social divide you are in and where you might be able to hide out.",The Purge - Anarchy

I love the concept of these movies, but, for some reason, they are prudishly directed. Setting aside the lack of sexuality, this is a fine horror/thriller that expands on the ideas from the first film, without hurting the franchise...

95,ArchonCinemaReviews,Far more thoughtful and realistic - disturbing and scary,8,5 September 2014,"In The Purge Anarchy the new founding fathers sanction another murderous cleanse.The Purge Anarchy revisits the gruesome dystopia in the not so distant future where for twelve hours all sanctioned crime is legal and all rescue services are suspended. The nation is reborn, unemployment and crime are at record lows, all because of the annual night for decriminalized murder to unleash pent up American rage.Five virtual strangers join together to survive when, after several unrelated but harrowing events, all find themselves on the street and in jeopardy on purge night. There is no security system, minimal defense and there is little hope.Despite being marketed as a horror film The Purge Anarchy feels more like a thriller. The potential for a despicable act of inhumanity is imminent and occurs frequently throughout the film. Yet, its display is the antithesis of a masturbatory gore fest relishing in the suffering, evocative of torture-porn. Instead, the brutality is appropriately out of focus in the background, almost as an afterthought, consistent with the desensitized society.The approach of James DeMonaco's direction is on point with the message of the film. He creates a disconcerting feeling with a deserted cityscape, seemingly lit at night by flickering yellow streetlights casting shrouded shadows. Certain scenes are realistically and deliberately shaky and imperfect to draw the audience into the character's peril.One can not talk about a second installment to a franchise without returning to its predecessor, in this case The Purge. Acclaimed as a novel premise and potentially unsettling look into the primal aspect of human nature, it left something to be desired. The story had so many places it could go that were raw and savage; yet, The Purge was slightly simplistic and flawed but still enjoyable. Once again James DeMonaco took the helm as writer and director of The Purge's sequel Anarchy. This time DeMonaco's execution was able to address criticisms by delving further into concept, but from a different perspective: the working class. In doing so we see a harsher existence, far less idealistic and a more depraved purge night.The difference between The Purge and The Purge Anarchy is that the active tormenters for this purge are not all unhinged closeted maniacs hiding behind masks. Anarchy takes the end of The Purge and goes more in-depth. Those participating are frustrated and exhausted but ultimately they are people. Most terrifyingly it proposes a hypothetical and disturbingly feasible purge experience for the upper class. The nefarious top 10% obligingly exercise their civic responsibility and now government granted right in style and comfort. The Purge Anarchy is a commentary on society and social inequality in the most gruesome of circumstances.The film's ability to play into our inner fears, that deep within anyone there is a darkness capable of unspeakable evil, is pivotal to its success. While I wish The Purge Anarchy hadn't tried to tidy the story up and resolve everything I did find it far more realistic and thought provoking than the former.More reviews of recent releases can be found at our website.",The Purge - Anarchy
96,nitzanhavoc,A little too political and not enough Horror - but an excellent film and sequel!,8,1 April 2016,"In my opinion, every Horror story's plot, premise and conclusion it define it's need (or lack thereof) a sequel, as well as set the borders for the sequel's story-line. The first film from 2013 took a fantastic and original idea executed in a manner that unfortunately left a little to be desired. Unlike most Horror films, and in a way slightly resembling the Hostel series, The Purge's main theme is criticism of the human nature. As such a film, the plot and story- line are secondary, and there was absolutely no interest in the Sandin family once the film concluded.Thankfully, profound screenwriter and director James DeMonaco had recognized the aforementioned fact, and therefore created a sequel focusing on an entirely new plot. On his way to extract his (well justified?) vengeance on the one night when it isn't just legal but a legal civic right - a stranger (Frank Grillo in what could very be his best part to date) stumbles upon Eva (Carmen Ejogo) and her daughter Cali (Zoë Soul) who are about to be cruelly executed by a gang of purgers. Despite himself, he tries to save them, and ends up saving the troublesome couple Shane (Zach Gilford) and Liz (Kiele Sanchez) along the way. While the main goal is to survive, the frightened four led by the stranger can't help but feeling uncomfortable with the fact that their savior is still just another purger seeking to end lives.The entire cast has performed profoundly, regardless to being mostly anonymous. Unlike the first film,The Purge: Anarchy is mostly an action film with some Horror aspects, with characteristics and a general pace not unlike a Zombie flick. While the name of the game is survival, the central aspect is the criticism and social statement. Adding to the human nature criticism of the first film, the second adds a more obvious debate against capitalism, social gaps and the American way. A little too political for my taste this time, but still delivered professionally and impressively.All in all, this sequel is just as entertaining as the first part, albeit much less of a ""Horror"" film per se. Unlike 99% of films focusing on social justice, The Purge: Anarchy presents its statement in an entertaining, fun and thought inspiring fashion. Watch and learn - this is how cinema is supposed to criticize the foundation. A very recommended film, both to fans of the first one and to those only now getting familiar with this new national holiday.",The Purge - Anarchy

Can Leo really save everyone? Frank Gillo makes for a very convincing and likable hero. While we watch and the story unfolds, first time when i looked at the trailer i said oh may god this is going to be the trash sequel after i toke look again it reminded of Judgement Night (1993) Running away form Crazy Psycho Purge people it had a good main role actor Frank Grillo going out for revenge killed kick guards in ass. With improved action, a better setting, and some dynamic characters i love the idea of movie i expect to longer action movie a very fast action but it was but not long as enough but movie didn't needed to be that long as first movie really sucked with Writer/Director James DeMonaco i just expecting that different director to have more better idea's the First Purge the writing of movie just didn't make any sense it felt like 5 year old write all that but this writing is not that bad as i thought The big mistake with the first film was making it a trite home invasion thriller that should have been second or third to put that story in franchise i wish Purge Anarchy should have been the first one then Purge (2013) Story can go to second movie but main Character Leo and some of another characters like Cali was more Likable then Ethan Hawke daughter stupid characters in movie. The 2013 movie ""The Purge"" left a bad taste in all of our mouths as nothing more than a pseudo-slasher with a Hamfisted plot, poor pacing,BORING VILLAIN with boring actors expect for Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey and a desperate attempt. The Purge Anarchy is a great film with in its own right and it's worth watching. i mean the first movie with really sucked boring but Purge Anarchy better 7.10 i won't give it a 10.10 i mean it got better who knows the 3rd prequel it is going to be a prequel of movie i will never care for this.

98,pfgpowell-1,Despicable sh*te,1,17 July 2015,"First off, here's the deal: I watched the first 31 minutes and 30 seconds of this before I knocked it on the head. Like most films these days, courtesy of the latest technology, cameras and the rest, The Purge: Anarchy looks good. Apart from that it is codswallop.For several years now, my son, 16, and I, 65, will settle in off a night and watch a film together. Sometimes he suggests one, sometimes I do. As a mid-teen his tastes vary from mine, and after he had seen The Purge, he got hold of this, the sequel and suggested we watch it. (NB My suggestion was Alpha Dog, which I have already seen and which I rate.My son explained to me the premise behind the original film (and, of course, this one): that for 12 hours a year all and any crime can be committed with impunity. Right off, when he told me, it sounded very much like 'producer's/writer's pitch' and I did not have high hopes. You can never judge a book by its cover or a film by a brief synopsis - give both a chance 'cos you might well be surprised: in execution what sounds like a dumb-ass premise somehow comes good.Not in this case: in the event even my not so high hopes were far too high. The Purge: Anarchy - my son insists its prequel had a 'bit of a story', but this one doesn't - is intended merely to titillate, to give those men of all ages - I doubt any woman is going to like this kind of schlock - suspended between infantility and early adolescence some kind of thrill. But what that thrill might be, I really cannot even begin to guess.If you like watching mutilations, murder, violence and gore simply for the hell of it, this film is for you (and hurry up and grow up). If your tastes extend to something just - well, just a little better, don't waste your time.) Ironically, a few years ago I watched a similar film to this called Judgment Night, more or less the same premise but streets ahead of this cr*p. Just goes to show that how you do something is the secret: as the saying is, it's not the joke but the way you tell it.PS Don't be taken in by any kind of pseudo political message. That is just to fool you into thinking there's more to this than meets the eye. There isn't. This is simply top-grade total garbage with an excellent cinematographer.",The Purge - Anarchy
99,david-meldrum,"Stronger than the first and third outings in the series, a decent horror-tinged action film",6,15 February 2019,"A stronger film than the first in the series, both wider and deeper as it follows two pairs of people and one individual thrown together on the streets on Purge night. Where the first film was a stripped back home invasion story, this is a horror-inflected action film, with gripping set pieces, and a dig into deeper themes of the divide between rich and poor. There's much more to be done with these ideas, and if this film doesn't do enough with them it at least maintains some focus where the third film starts promisingly and ends up sprawling and incoherent.",The Purge - Anarchy
100,skybrick736,Purge Anarchy,6,8 January 2015,"Purge Anarchy ditches a lot of horror elements that the filmmakers presented in the first movie and went directly to an all-out action flick with revenge sub-plot. Although Anarchy has some bad ass looking villains and a perfect casted and acted in hero in Frank Grillo, it lacked in a lot of other departments. The supporting cast and characters were annoying and given terrible dialog by the script writers. Anarchy failed also to be even remotely original with again predictable events much like the first. I was still thoroughly engaged throughout the entire film but I couldn't help but feel a little let down with this highly praised sequel.

103,TheMarwood,Superior sequel,6,12 October 2014,"The first film was a generic home invasion flick with a gimmick that reduced the 'all crime is legal for 12 hours' concept to essentially a narrative countdown clock device - a family must survive for such and such more time and the film wasted a decent premise. The Purge:Anarchy rights the wrongs of its predecessor and delivers on the high concept. The characters are thinly written, but played with adequate skill by the actors and a more than decent performance by Frank Grillo as the lead. The satire is about as subtle as a round of bullets to the chest and the film never feels comfortable during the few moments the story calms down to spend time developing the characters, but this was made for visceral thrills and B grade enjoyment. The mayhem is relentless and while the low budget certainly reduced the amount of arson to a few fleeting glimpses, the violent set pieces are staged with enough wit to make this sequel a nice surprise.",The Purge - Anarchy

So, I was really thrilled to see that there is the chapter two which is Anarchy!And I think that this one is better than the first one though it is not saying that the 1st one was bad! I give the both movies the same score of 8!What makes this movie better for me is that there are several stories which you follow and in a a way unites into one single story of survival, revenge and purge! Also, in a way, this chapter two seems more terrific because - I don't know why - I thought that all this might actually happen in the near future to some societies ( USA being the number one likely state with recent unrests and protests and killings of some parts of society).Disturbing!

Mother and daughter Ava and Cali who are dealing with money trouble, young couple Liz and Shane get stranded on the road after their car dies and possibly a separation. What I liked about the sequel was how there was a lot more to the purge than initially let on and also creating an anti purge group who believe the purge dies more harm than good.

109,loomis78-815-989034,Better than the original.,8,30 July 2014,"This sequel starts one year after the original with the annual purge coming up. This time we take to the streets and examine it from the other side of the poor and how they have to deal with the government sanctioned night of crime and terror. Mother Eva (Ejogo) and daughter Cali (Soul) are forced from their apartment and barely escape when an out for revenge man known as Sergeant (Grillo) saves them from what appears to be a government sanctioned hit squad. They soon pick up Shane (Gilfford) and Liz (Kiele Sanchez) a couple who had their car strand them after the purge began. The story is told through their eyes as they try to survive the 12 hours of the purge. Returning Writer/Director James DeMonaco is back with a budget this time and explores much more than he could in the original. Anarchy continues themes the first film had, like the morality play of the situation. It extends the Untrustworthy government angle and the class war is also stretched out. With the whole city at their disposal instead of a home invaded house, this sequel, and its larger scope is actually a more realized film than the original. Once again, DeMonaco writes some real characters that the audience cares about and cheers for the entire ordeal. Frank Grillo is outstanding and completely believable as the lone wolf leading the group. Ejogo and Soul as the mother and daughter team have real acting chops and are great here as well. The entire cast is solid and the movie delivers on true suspense and the horror of some of the situations that the purge presents along the way. The end scene is memorable. Like the first film, the scariest thing about these films is the fact that it could truly happen. DeMonaco has taken an idea that he could pursue over many different films and explore with different characters. The movie has a lot to say no matter what side of the political arena you are on. Bloody, violent, entertaining and thought provoking Anarchy is a better film than the original.",The Purge - Anarchy
110,trublu215,A definite improvement on the original.,8,17 July 2014,"The Purge was a film that was a great concept that was poorly executed, making the concept better than the actual story at hand. And just what we wanted to see last year, we get to see this year in The Purge: Anarchy. The film tells the story of the fateful futuristic night that takes place once a year across America where all crime is legal. The film follows a mysterious anti-hero, played by Frank Grillo. This exactly what we wanted out of the concept of The Purge. This film plays out like a ticking clock as we follow a band of survivors lead by Grillo who try and survive the night. While the film is disturbing and has a horror atmosphere to it, it is very much a gritty and brutal action thriller. The film moves quickly and doesn't lag like the original. We get glimpses of character development, but for the most part, this is a brisk watch. It is fast and furious and moves like a bullet. My only issue with the film would have to be the ending, which comes somewhat abruptly and absurdly. But overlooking that, and considering the expectations for this film are low, this is a film that surprises in the best ways. This is a down and dirty action thriller shot as gritty and realistic as can be. The highlights of the film are absolutely the action sequences and racing through the city streets never knowing what is lurking behind the corner, it is truly some thrilling stuff. Overall, The Purge: Anarchy is a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon. Its a film with nothing extravagant but does the trick and entertains you. I highly recommend it.",The Purge - Anarchy

112,zac-04879,Decently Set in the Chaos,6,9 June 2021,"The Purge: Anarchy is another slow tale of legalised crime, but unlike the first film, the characters and story are not as foolish or unhurried. Although it's a great story about a violent community for an action-thriller, Anarchy isn't so much a movie you'd locate in the horror genre.Overall, the second Purge film is... not great, but it's fair to say that this action-packed thriller is more entertaining, more gripping, and genuinely just better than the first film. It's stuffed with aggression and greed, but those expecting violent activity and crime will seriously get what they want this time. What makes the action so hot-headed this time, is the fact that the story is set out in the zones of brutal mayhem. So if it wasn't obvious to you, despite the longer runtime, The Purge: Anarchy is actually thoroughly watchable.Fans of The Purge will surely have a liking for this sequel, despite the flatness of the story.

It corrects and fixes all the mistakes that it's predecessor made in the first movie which was good, but not good enough and had a lot of holes to critic and talk about. You could feel that the first movie did not execute the brainstorming idea that was behind it, but this one, this one deserves all the glory and pushes the concept to live to it's potential. Here, the story expands, the idea expands, the producer opens our eyes to the city in the Purge night where it all happens. You can feel the fear, the agony, the momentum, the drama and all ""what if it really happened"" thoughts while watching the movie.

Before this, there was: THE HUNGER GAMES, BATTLE ROYALE, THE RUNNING MAN, DEATH RACE 2000, and so forth. In order to best enjoy the film, it helps to suspend your disbelief... quite a bit, in fact! Sometimes, however, it's too tough to wrap your head around it, though. Think about it: Why would the government (all the way up to the president himself) allow an annual one-night suspension of all law enforcement, firefighting, and medical assistance to allow average citizens to engage in brutal combat with each other? What about the millions of dollars in property damages alone? Not to mention the fact that nothing is off-limits. What if somebody wanted to blow up the White House? Would that be off-limits on Purge Night? Okay, okay, let's put common sense to the side. Done with my rant, I'll review the movie itself. In many ways, THE PURGE: ANARCHY is better than the first film. In this one, people are unwittingly caught outside during the annual Purge. Now they're running for their lives, following the leadership of a shadowy man with a hidden agenda of his own. The tension has been ratcheted up even more than the first, as are the bloody violent deaths. There's one really intense scene where the group thinks they've found refuge, only to have their rescuers turn on each other in revenge. So, take it or leave it, like the first. This just feels like more of the same. I personally think it's slightly better than the first, but still it's not much to write home about.",The Purge - Anarchy
115,TheRedDeath30,Crappy Sequel to a Crappy Movie,4,6 December 2014,"This is the sort of mindless, inane horror film that Hollywood loves to churn out, while intelligent quality horror films get relegated to Direct to DVD status. I get it. It's simple entertainment that requires no thought and provides 90 minutes of fun while you munch your popcorn, but there's nothing creative or memorable to this movie. I left it thinking it's the sort of movie that I would have thought up when I was 17 and just wanted ""more"" of everything.I will qualify by saying that I'm not that big a fan of the first movie, either. I found it very mediocre, so I was already skeptical about the sequel, though figured I'd give it a chance since it was a much different premise.The movie wants very much to explore concepts of class status and the ways that laws are created to further subjugate the poor. There is nothing, at all, subtle about this message, though, because it is bashed over our heads repeatedly throughout the run time of the movie. Rich people are bad, the poor are downtrodden, the government is an evil entity that exists to further raise up the status of the rich and powerful. It's the sort of generic mantra that I used to eat up as a young, idealistic student until I learned that the world isn't so black and white.So, the premise of the Purge is that all things are fine and there are no laws, but apparently the only law anyone wants to break is to murder. Still, two movies in, we've yet to really explore any other criminal path that would be possible that night because everyone in our country apparently just wants to murder their neighbors if given the chance. I guess that fits the horror movie genre, though.Two women (mother and daughter) are holed up for the night in a low- income apartment complex when the neighbor breaks in with some forced love on his mind. That plan is broken up by the invasion of mysterious soldiers who are there to slaughter the residents. Our women are captured, only to be rescued by our main hero, an amalgamation of The Punisher and the Wolverines from Red Dawn. This guy is out to avenge a wrong that had been done to him, though the movie never bothers to explain how we got a suped-up armored car or the military training necessary to take out a squad of government soldiers, but that's not necessary because the director isn't trying to craft anything close to an intelligent movie.Enter our next couple, who've been hunted by some kids who are straight outta THE STRANGERS or EDEN LAKE, complete with typical ""scary"" masks that have been done to death already. They are, of course, rescued by our hero as well to create the little pack that is the central group of our movie.Of course, all of the plot strands come together conveniently for the final of the movie, which leads up to your generic ""hero learns that revenge will accomplish nothing"" resolution and the big brother reveal at the ending.It's all just pieces cut out of other, much better horror movies and assembled to create a movie that teenagers will pay to see in the theater. I don't usually like to write reviews with this much trolling, but I guess it bothers me that real horror goes unnoticed while garbage like this gets wide release.",The Purge - Anarchy
116,FallenEye,This Purge Survives and Stays Safe.,6,26 November 2016,"The Purge itself was so horrendously awful, that it really didn't take much to produce an infinitely better product with the second installment. As superior in every way, as The Purge: Anarchy is in comparison to The Purge, it suffers from being better than a first installment that is tantamount to garbage, and thus, can seem better than it actually is. The Purge was supposed to be at least, what The Purge: Anarchy was, and so, The Purge: Anarchy, could've been even better.However, judging The Purge: Anarchy on its own merit, the movie was quite entertaining and sad to concede to. A human's selfish nature is not restricted to only destroying all things except other humans... A human's selfish, cruel and revolting nature transcends anything a human wants it to, and Anarchy did a much better job at depicting that. Humans treating humans like animals (not that animals deserve it) and humans being loathsome without reason is very, human. Anarchy is more tense, or rather, tense period, seeing as its predecessor was so incredibly limp.James Sandin vs The Sergeant: Hawkes' James character was worth caring about, and was really the only character worth caring about, however Grillos' character was a major upgrade. We care about him a whole lot more, because his actions and motives are far better fleshed out, or again rather, fleshed out period. I do have 1 problem with The Sergeant though: Had he not crossed paths with Cali and Eva, he would've probably killed the man responsible for his son's death. Problem is, if The Sergeant really cared about his son so much, why wait for a ""get out of jail free card"" before killing Grass? Why not kill him whenever/as soon as humanly possible, because Grass took his world... So surely, jail should be of no consequence.Mary Sandin vs Eva Sanchez: Mary was an OK character throughout, but Eva also had a ""story"" that was far more compelling, and so, she's able to win the audience over far easier.Charlie and Zoey Sandin vs Cali Sanchez: Cali is such a better character than Charlie and Zoey put together (they can't even be set side by side), that Charlie and Zoey should actually be compared to the guy who revealed his face in the van... He, with the 1 minute he spent on camera, was a far, far higher-ranking character than those two.Overall, The Purge: Anarchy is better than The Purge in every way, in every single way. From performances, to characters, to story, to direction, score, actors, motives and, and, and. Even Shane's death was more heart breaking than James'. Sadly, this doesn't make Anarchy amazing, it just makes it better than something so godawful. Anarchy is twice the movie The Purge was, and it didn't have Charlie, or a character even remotely that irritating, so 6.2/10 it shall be from me.",The Purge - Anarchy
117,martinrobertson300482,Expands on the restricted ideas of the original,8,26 August 2014,"Whether you liked the first ""Purge"" movie or not. There's no denying that its central idea was a good one. An idea ready to be milked by possible sequels. So here's the first sequel they're attempting. Essentially ""The Purge 2."" Where as the first movie was over all disappointing, I actually enjoyed ""The Purge – Anarky"" a heck of a lot more. Sure, its no masterpiece. But with a bigger playing field, more characters and a lot more going on. The film is a lot more entertaining this time around. Plus its lack of stars keeps you on edge. As you really can't predict where these characters are going, or which ones are going to get the chop.Basically ""The Purge – Anarky"" expands on the restricted ideas of the original, taking the horror outside and turning it more into a jam packed action movie. Where that sounds like an improvement or not is up to the individual. But me, personally, I thought it was a lot better. Even if it does leave some of its horror elements to the side in favour of plenty of gun totting action.",The Purge - Anarchy
118,rlaine,I think the first was better,5,19 October 2015,"I watched both of the Purge movies recently and was a bit surprised that the sequel enjoys better score and reviews. I think the first Purge was more solid and generally better crafted movie, altho it's true that the ""home invasion"" setting of the first wasn't exactly unique.What I didn't like about this sequel was that the script wasn't even nearly as solid and focused as the first. Too many characters (who were not very interesting) and the scenes didn't fit together very well. The style was very much like a TV series, not very stylish in my opinion. I think there was way too much happening anyway.The whole idea of this dystopian USA and the purge night is pretty good, I'm kind of interested how the third one will be, but I fear it will go to even bigger and end up too grandiose. Even this second movie was a bit too underliney.Maybe this sequel is more for the action fans and younger audience. I liked the first more.",The Purge - Anarchy
119,ghost_dog86,"Was I the only one who enjoyed ""The Purge""?",3,28 July 2014,"If 1979's ""The Warriors"" were remade today, it would be ""The Purge: Anarchy"". If 1979's ""The Warriors"" were remade today into a good movie, it would be something completely different.""The Purge: Anarchy"" is that rare instance when the writer/director comes back to do the sequel and the sequel seems as if it were written and directed by someone who had heard of the original, but had never seen it. Implementing the routine big budget sequel idea of taking what was done in the original and simply adding ""more"", ""Anarchy"" suffers from the same affliction most sequels tend to suffer from: a simple premise that is nearly obliterated by excess; excess story, excess characters and an excess of things-go-boom moments. Where the delightfully simplistic premise of ""The Purge"" concerned a family fighting to survive a home invasion on the one night a year where all crime (including murder) is legal, ""Anarchy"" expands on the original ""there's a killer in my house"" horror premise, by taking it to the streets; this time following five people from all walks of life, attempting to survive the night.Like I said, the first half is basically ""The Warriors"", where a group of people must survive the night by getting from point A to point B, whist being chased by gangs of killers (one of which holds a strong resemblance to members of the rap group Odd Future) which, in a pitch meeting, I'm sure sounded great. And in fact, the first 50 minutes or so does deliver an ample amount of tension as the group narrowly escapes one potentially fatal incident after another. After that though, it all goes downhill, as ""Anarchy"" forces a plot twist, resembling something out of (obscure reference of the day) ""Hostel 3"", down our throats; a plot twist which is totally given away in the trailers. LAME! Oh, and the ending sucked too...so, there's that.Final Thought: With a not so subtle ""rich people bad, poor people good"" motif, that gets pretty played out after the first hour. With graphics ranging from meh to not awful. With massive plot holes, such as: Is the city hospital really open on Purge night or did the nurses simply risk death by going into work a little early? Maybe since the Purge is a national holiday (of sorts) nurses and doctors get time and a half? ANYWAY, all of that would have been tolerable if not for writer/director James DeMonaco making it so I really never cared about any of the characters, their destination or their fates. It should also say a tremendous amount about the performances that I don't think it was worth naming any of the actors. Furthermore, by forcing a simple idea to stretch beyond its means, ""Anarchy"" seems to have lost all of the dystopian uneasiness which made its predecessor halfway intriguing.",The Purge - Anarchy
120,FairlyAnonymous,"Is is entertaining? Not really, but it isn't horrible",5,10 December 2014,"The Purge: Anarchy takes the concept of The Purge in a right direction. Instead of making it a home-invasion movie, it shows the issue on a national scale and shows how it effects the rich, the poor, and what it means to people. This is a good choice; however, it doesn't make it a good movie.While The Purge was a bad movie, it was definitely entertaining to make fun of because of how lame it was. So while it was bad, it was entertaining to sit and watch with friends. However, The Purge: Anarchy suffers from the ""50% rating"" syndrome. A movie that isn't good or isn't bad can't really be enjoyed. It can't be made fun of, but it can't be enjoyed for being good. It just simply exists.The plot follows yet another Purge, but we see it in a city scenario. People go through the streets killing other people for fun. However, some people take the opportunity to be more creative with this freedom: Rich people hire other people to collect people off the streets and throw them into an arena where rich people can go in and kill them. Another example is that rich people will actually pay people to sacrifice themselves in the house's of the rich people so that the rich people have the opportunity to kill, but from the safety of their house.The message here is a bit obvious. Rich white people are evil. But at least this movie actually goes somewhere with the premise. The main character in the movie is a man who is seeking revenge for the man who killed someone close to him in an ""accident"". It is pretty obvious that the movie was leading to some sort of ""twist"" ending, but it doesn't pull it off too well.Overall, not a horrible movie but not a good movie. It is just there taking up time and space.",The Purge - Anarchy

122,Spideyfan-963-246215,The Purge: Anarchy Review,1,7 September 2016,"The Purge: Anarchy (2014) Starring: Frank Grillo,Carmen Ejogo, Zach Gilford, Kiele Sanchez,Zoë Borde,Justina Machado,John Beasley,Jack Conley,Noel Gugliemi,Castulo Guerra,Michael K. Williams,Edwin Hodge,Keith Stanfield,Roberta Valderrama,Nicholas Gonzalez, Amy Paffrath,and Niko Nicotera Directed by James DeMonaco Review I guess now since we don't get a Saw movie every year and the paranormal activity franchise could be dying out soon we need another one of this franchises to make every year. Purge is what we have sadly, oh goody. The Purge Anarchy is the latest sequel that no one wanted but we got cause we for some reason gave the first film a whole lot of money when it was one of the worst horror films conceived by man. The first film was a shitty home invasion film and when you think about this concept and it taking place outside you might think ""hey you know what this one could actually be good"" but my goodness did it suck.It's directed by the same person and it's written by the same person so why would it be any better? It's the same dang thing just outside now. The biggest problem was not just the story but stupid characters do stupid things and now where in this horrible situation. Usually in some other films where theirs a plot device it's actually a thing like an item but in the first purge movie the plot device was people,stupid people letting strangers into there house who mind you that same person is in this terrible sequel,OK why? In this film it's like that again stupid characters doing really idiotic things,just really dumb decisions. Early on in the movie there is a killer coming to an apartment and this stupid girl in a closet says ""where back here,don't come in we have lots of guns."" Now what would you do in that situation hide and don't say a word or blurt out exactly where you are? Now mind you I didn't miss the point of this movie this time around. Rich people, the government are trying to control the population in very bad ways sometimes you know it's kind of a commentary on society. The reason that theme doesn't work,the reason it doesn't hit home, the reason why it isn't a powerful message that audience can suck in is because this film is just a mindlessly violent movie where innocent bystanders are maliciously killed for an hour and a half. Why would a person want to watch a movie like that? It would be one thing if this film was trying to make a point but the point is deeply lost in context through a mess of a movie.The director keeps on cutting to scenes of random people getting shot or stabbed, it doesn't have the impact it needs and becomes mindlessly and grotesquely violent. Here's what I can say to back myself up in all this by describing a scene in the movie, main characters are walking by and see some homeless people who are trying to shield themselves from this night. They are deep underground,barely visible at all,they've shoved themselves into this corner, you can't even see them there hiding. All of a sudden some guy just drives by in his car,he's got a flamethrower he's just screaming and hollering, as soon as the main characters start to run away for some reason these homeless people decide to show themselves and as soon as this flamethrower guy comes out why, so that a whole bunch of faceless bodies can be burned or shot or stabbed because the directors like we need to kill some people now. The movie is one big violent and non-cohesive mess of a film that should be buried, it is one of the worst horror films I have seen and it is one of the worst films all year, I give The Purge Anarchy a half out of five.",The Purge - Anarchy

124,Saiph90,Should stick to one theme,3,26 December 2014,"I watched the original Purge movie and enjoyed the concept, the original was a decent house siege film. So here we have the ubiquitous Hollywood sequel which fails, the film either intentionally or unintentionally nods towards the great 'The Warriors' film the masks, the baseball bats in slow motion but gets nowhere near in terms of style or suspense. The film makers had a choice and failed because they wanted to have a political element which is white people at the Purge would commit genocide on black people, other apparently normal white people would pay for poor black people to kill. They could either explore this or leave it and make an action movie but trying to combine fails.",The Purge - Anarchy
125,foxtografo,Way better than the first one!,8,29 September 2014,"The set up is the same than the first one. The legalised one day a year crime spree. What is way better in comparison to the first is the characters. This kind of action / thriller movies fail most of the time because of silly characters that's difficult to connect with and behave in ridiculous random ways. This is not the case, besides of the good acting, there's good characters, and they react the way you want them to react, or logic would tell someone would react to situations on an action movie. Photography was good, and there was more development on the different factions derivative of the story set up. Good action, good story, characters and good photography. Everything runs smoothly on this movie, I don't give it a 10 because there's nothing original about it, but is excellent as what it is meant to be. Also, there's no need of watch the previous (and inferior) movie, as there's no continuity, just the same background set up. I definitely recommend it if you fancy an action thriller with no pretencions.",The Purge - Anarchy
126,datorsiers2,A huge improvement,8,1 November 2015,"Having seen the first one i went into watching the sequel expecting it to be bad or even worse than the first one was. This was one of those rare times, when the second chapter was better than the first. In ''The Purge'' we saw bad acting, extremely poor storyline, boring scenes. Here it branched out and the movie was shot all over the city, making the viewer not get bored. In the first one everything happened at the same place and it just was not intense.The acting here has been stepped up a notch, the main character was great, a likable character, on the contrary of what we saw in the first movie. Here we could really feel the tension and see how this great and interesting idea of ''The Purge'' should have been played out previously, this is exactly what i expected to see the first time.Big props to James DeMonaco for understanding and accepting the flaws of his first movie and using the newly acquired knowledge to surprise purge fans with a much better sequel. Hopefully the third installment will live up to the standard of this movie. I sincerely think the rating of this movie is largely based on the failure of the first film and that is only understandable.If you did not enjoy the first movie, but you loved the idea of it, just like it did, i suggest you checking this out, it might live up to your expectations and surprise you in a positive way!",The Purge - Anarchy

I have to say, that this one was a disappointment like the first one. The premise of the story is very interesting and original but the outcome is sloppy and messy. I wish they had made the Purge films like an anthology series, this format would make the films a lot better.The acting is pretty bad. The only good actors in the entire film are Frank Grillo and Michael Kenneth Williams. Grillo is a badass who stops at nothing to achieve his goals. The pacing is fast and gets us into the action quickly. The runtime is overlong.Pros: Interesting story fast pacing, and good acting by Frank Grillo and Michael Kenneth WilliamsCons: The story is messy and sloppy, unused potential when it comes to the premise, bad acting, and an overlong runtimeOverall Rating: 4.2P.S.

129,lucasnochez,Film Review: The Purge: Anarchy,9,24 July 2014,"""Just remember all the good the purge does.""Some purge for money, some purge for revenge, and some just purge for the fun of it. Whatever it is one is purging for, one can't help but be drawn to this crazy and maniacally satisfying cinematic story concept.Stock brokers hang from the front doors of banks, people are killed for being caught cheating on their spouses, and those with repressed feelings are all questioned as to why they are out on the one night of the year where all crime, including murder, is legal in 2023 America.The Purge: Anarchy is story-telling brilliance. Outdoing its predecessor in narrative, character building and spectacle, the sequel reveals the many questions audience members were thinking during The Purge. Such questions include; what happens to people who are caught outside unwillingly on the streets on the scariest 'holiday' in America, what happens to the people who cannot afford to protect themselves the same way the rich can, and just how far are good people willing to go for vengeance?Unlike the original Purge, director/writer James DeMonaco decides to do what every good director would have done with a story idea like this, and that is multiple-character narratives that eventually intersect.As the evening is coming to an end and the 12 Hour Purge period begins, the world that DeMonaco created does not seem as far away from our own as we are introduced to an array of different relatable characters. Single-mother Eva (Carmen Ejogo) and her daughter Cali (Zoë Soul) along with her ailing father Rico (John Beasley) are a hard working family. Eva, who works as a waitress at a local diner in the projects of Los Angeles, asks her boss for a raise on the eve of the Sixth Annual Purge that will help with her father's piling medical bills. Denied, Eva makes her way back home to lock-down her little apartment with very little means of security. Meanwhile, on the other side of town, Shane (Zach Gilford) and Liz (Kiele Sanchez) are having their own problems in their relationship, as well as being following by a gang of anxious masked maniacs who follow them upon learning that their car is stalled on the side of the road due to 'accidental' mechanical problems. Both pairs of people, unprepared and scared of participating in the purge, try to survive the night on their own, until they luckily stumble across the Sergeant (Frank Grillo), a man who is justifying his night by killing the man who took his son away from him.Hours before the annual commencement, people flood the streets, searching for last minute 'protection' from their partners, their bosses, their disgruntled family members or friends and say goodbye with the words, ""stay safe"". They treat the purge as a holiday; some as a patriotic day of cleansing, others as a religious right of passage. Some call it ""releasing the beast"", others refer to it as ""enjoying the cleanse"", but one thing becomes clear, it reminds us of the crazy times of the year where people are uninterested in your feelings or concerns, a time that could be compared to the holidays, where the 'dog-eat-dog' attitude of people becomes ever more apparent. Purging could easily be compared to practically every holiday we experience where people are animals on the road and on the streets, but perfectly behaved citizens in their homes and within the walls of church halls and religious centres and perfectly adequate images in social settings.I believe DeMonaco has crafted a story idea and made a film that is a lot deeper and more complex than people would like to admit. After all, the film is a free-for-all excuse to have people watch just exactly what people are thinking of doing to others that hurt them, without ever getting their hands dirty. Anarchy really goes with the idea of what people would actually do if that little thought in their head of killing their boss, could actually be materialized in the real world, without any consequences.In addition, Anarchy shows the very faint hints of social, racial and economic inequality that is plaguing DeMonaco's America of the future. Unemployment is less than 5% and poverty is at 1%, and the purge is to thank for this tremendous social statistic, yet, the rich hide and buy their way to an American tradition of cleaning through their heavily-secured houses while the poor help deliver homeless people, hostages found on the street and 'martyrs' who offer up their bodies as a bloody canvas for rich families while their next of kin receive momentous amounts of money. In any direction you put it, the ones who suffer the most are the poor and lower class, and Anarchy spends most of its time showing this obvious and super disturbing truth of an American society whose idea of 'cleansing' is no different than the idea Adolf Hitler had in the 1930′s.Cali, a smart and web-savvy young woman, shows her grandfather videos of the revolution against the purge and the conservative, rich-white American leaders who have founded it, aptly referred to as the Founding Fathers. Tapping into the emergency broadcasting system, Carmelo (Michael K. Williams), the leader against the founding fathers and face of the rebellion, shows DeMarco's intention for future purge narratives, where the focus will more likely be the inner workings of big, corporate America, using the purge as an excuse for the lower-class civilians of exterminating themselves until there is no more lower class. Sadly, Anarchy never really dives deep into the subplot of Carmelo and the revolution against the founding fathers, but if this second entry of what is being described as an ""American Tradition"" continues to flood screens the next couple of years, I am sure audiences will get their fair share of purging entertainment with a dash of social relevance for years to come.",The Purge - Anarchy
130,priyantha-bandara,Maybe I should be Purged for liking this!,6,23 November 2014,"For being a movie based on an utterly dismissible theory it's something to ponder upon how this is actually pulled off. To be honest thought how dumb it sounds I was hanging on to it and wanted to witness it till the end and even at the end it made some sense and it's crazy. Maybe I should be purged!! And I must say that I have not seeing the predecessor of The Purge Anarchy there for I have no way of comparing it with this one. But strangely bit familiar in the same lines of The Hunger Games, this one does a decent job being more realistic and close to home.In not so distant future the US government has found a mechanism to keep its population and crime rate in control. The annual purge that last a 12 hour period let the civilians to let out their rage and cleans themselves. And in this period all crimes including murder is accepted by low. The story of a former low enforcement agent looking for revenge from previous years purge and few civilians who he happen to tag alone and their combined effort of surviving through the purge night is what The Purge Anarchy is all about.Like I mentioned at the start the whole plot seems absurd. Yet the whole time we are left to believe it so strongly and confidently after sometime it will sink right in. And from that point the viewer will go through the horrific journey of survival along with the characters and corner to corner there is some new experience wait. And unexpectedly The Purge Anarchy does not cross its limits with being too gory or violent. It operates within a certain discipline and this makes the journey somewhat pleasant than road paved with flesh and blood. And the good twists that comes out of nowhere does a decent job and spicing things up.While The Purge Anarchy is a horrific thriller from the surface it does have an underlying message that is well put together. A certain hope of humanity is emerging from the brutal actions of the rulers and the story manages to shine it to give some hope for the god forbidden future.",The Purge - Anarchy

This time, we are shown how the Purge affects the more common folks and what is the situation on the streets in the big cities, which is miles better than showing a Rich family with stupid kids dealing with their screw ups. There are three stories which combine later on. A couple gets stranded just before the purge near downtown; A mother and a daughter being attacked during the purge; A badass father out for revenge. Aside from the father, I didn't really like the characters but he was sufficient enough. Where this movie excels is depicting the horrors of the purge and how humans can easily loose their morality when something becomes legal. The legality of murder adds this weird creepiness in the movie. We also get to see some political stuff, resistances etc. The movie did had some pacing issues. I felt the middle portion bogged down a bit. Also, the characters drama was meh for the most part.

The budget triples to $9 million this time, and allows a much more expansive narrative. In this movie, we're plunged into the nightmare going on across the streets of Los Angeles.The cinematography and film score are both top notch. So is the acting across the board. You truly feel for these characters and what they're going through.And, like in the first film, DeMonaco delivers shocks that you don't see coming.

136,pontus-randen,Better. But there is so much more to explore.,7,28 September 2014,"This one was actually better than the first one, where they only stayed in on e single house all the time. Here they were all over the place and lots of different purge situations occurred. But boy, with this idea they could do so much more.I imagine the next one to be about an ex marine and we follow him all through the year when he is writing a list of known child molesters, killers, feminists and other low life. And then: The night of the Purge! And now we follow our hero as he goes along, killing all the people on his list. We might also follow other people on the night of the purge (and before) when they are revenging different wrong doings.",The Purge - Anarchy
137,quinnox-1,Superb sequel and one of the best horror/thriller movies in some time,9,20 January 2015,"I was blown away at how good this movie turned out to be, and a sequel to a fine horror movie in its own right no less, which is rare these days.The movie created a palpable and tense atmosphere from the outset, when a young innocent couple is stranded on the freeway when their car breaks down. The couple are now faced with surviving alone and unarmed in a big city full of thugs and killers on the prowl, when its the one night a year that all crime is deemed legal, including murder.The sense of menace and atmosphere is prevalent throughout the movie and really well done, and the story is very interesting and exciting, as a group of innocent people must cope and try to survive a night of brutality and horror where there are no rules. There are plenty of thrills and twists and turns, and the movie creates a very real sense of chaos and danger lurking around every corner.The setting of the cold and uncaring big city of Los Angeles is excellently shot, with great cinematography. The pacing is amazing and gripping. There is even a theme of redemption in the movie, it is not just a cheap and hollow typical horror film, with guts and gore as the only elements, like so many other lesser horror movies.The Purge and its sequel have proved to be one of the best horror franchises in some time, by outstanding director James DeMonaco. I only hope he directs a third movie and that it lives up to the first two!",The Purge - Anarchy
138,LiamBlackburn,Stereotypically bad,6,28 July 2014,"This was not as good as the first purge. This is just basically a group of people going around and shooting others who try and kill them. No real character development. One-dimensional characters and uneventful plot line. The action and shootings/killings are good so that is a redeemer. The worst part of the movie though, is how every single rich person is white. This is purposefully done to make everyone hate white people and think they are the rich ones who get to kill the poor people. This is totally racist and anti-white. I hate to bring the race card into this review but it needs to be mentioned. It's subliminal and a powerful subsconscious message that white people are evil.",The Purge - Anarchy
139,Sci-FiHorrorFan,This was a pleasant surprise and a huge improvement over the first film.,8,14 January 2015,"I thought this sequel was Badass and this is coming from a guy who hates the first film. This sequel improves over the original in every way. There were actually (likable) characters in this film,yes that was the biggest surprise of all,I actually liked most of the characters and even the ones I didn't know much about I thought were decent at least. There were some characters that at first I didn't know but then grew on me like Frank Grillos character I thought he was a cool guy and he knew how to fight. The film has the same crazy plot as the first film but in this film they have fun with it. One night a year all crime is legal in futuristic America. What makes this film work so well is its fast pace and entertaining action set pieces,which is something the original was lacking in. I found the purge anarchy to be fast paced and adrenaline pumping it was also exciting and intense and most of the action took place out on the streets unlike the first film where everything takes place in a house. The writer definitely had the right idea bringing the action to the streets it makes for a much more exciting Fun movie which this was.This film even improves on its bad guys The bad guys in this film I actually thought were okay they were not laughable like the bad guys in the first film,there were even some of them that were intimidating and wore creepy masks which look better than the dumb masks in part 1. Also each of our main characters has some character development unlike the previous film. I also really liked the Dark gritty atmosphere this film had I thought that gave the film a nice edge and added to the suspense and also having likable characters that you want to survive helps create more suspense and helps you get involved in the film. I also like the idea of all these people getting stuck outside on purge night and they all end up getting together and working together to survive the night. We have a couple who's car breaks down just before the purge begins and they need to quickly get off the street before the chaos ensues. We are also introduced to a mother and daughter who live together and in the night a group of crazy gunmen break into their house and grab them and kidnap them,they get dragged into the street and Frank Grillo sees them in trouble and he helps them he fights all the gunmen and he kicks their asses and starts shooting at them,he saves the mother and daughter and that's how they first meat,they then run away together and meet this couple who need help so they end up driving away together and for the rest of the movie it's those five characters on the run trying the avoid all the lunatics on the street.I also liked that the group of characters went from location to location so the Film was always moving and there was always action.I started to really like Frank Grillos character I thought he was a cool guy and I liked that his character had a bit of a back story,right from the moment we see him it's obvious he's a troubled man that's had a tough life which is why he sometimes got annoyed and angry but when I found out about his past I didn't blame him for being angry,heck if I had gone through what he want through I would have been angry too. Deep down he was a good guy because he tried to help four people survive the night and he gives them guns so they can all fight together. That's another reason why this film works because our five main characters work (together) to survive and they help each other Fight,they were Not damsels in distress like the people in the first film these people actually Fight back and kick ass.I really liked Frank Grillo as the lead hero and watching him kick ass was entertaining.I also appreciate the writer adding a little more emotion to his characters in this film unlike the first. This film had a lot of characters that grew on me and showed emotion and I wanted all of them to survive because I liked them. This was a good Action/Thriller and I highly recommend it.",The Purge - Anarchy
140,caelum-natura,"Great story and ""test"" of viewers morality",8,24 October 2020,"I loved this movie. It has storyline that is easy to follow, simple and somewhat predictable, but so well made. Characters connect to audience and you can feel what/how they feel. Cast is great, they all did their role well. Main character is fantastic. You can feel his dilemas. What I liked the most about this movie (and all other parts of this francise) is the moral questions we ask ourselves while watching this movie/s.It is one of those movies you'll gladly watch again on TV.

I know it will be different, but I love post apocalyptic atmosphere and I hope for the best here. The plot really matters to me as I was thinking more or less similar things many times and I am genuinely curious how will they show it etc.Let's start it!18 minutes - ""We need to run..."" Hah! This is what I wanted to hear! I love movies where the main character has to run from something. It makes movie so much more intense and interesting.27 minutes - this would never work out in the real life... people would not stop after 12h... not to mention wait whole years for another purge... If anything, this whole idea would spawn more and more murders who can't wait for the next event... but it is only a movie I get it, let's go back watching.57minutes - nothing really worth mentioning... nothing really good, neither bad... just normal and a little boring.1h 18minutes - maybe this movie had a nice idea and great ambition... but it is just plain stupid... retarded scheme where good guys never die and bad ones drop like flies...1h 34minutes - LOL they hear siren goes off and they all stop like that WTF RETARDED!!!

142,MUFCOK,Wasted Potential.,3,6 February 2015,"The main problem with both Purge movies is that they had a good idea on paper, it is different and I believe it had much more potential that it failed to reach. The Purge Anarchy unfortunately suffers from the usual clichés, annoying characters and cast, predictable plot and awful script. The concept is one that I like, it is unique and it does deliver a message throughout which is reasonable. I think the people who defend this film by constantly mentioning the 'messages' it portrays are clutching at straws to be honest. The 'message' that the creators are focusing on cannot outweigh the negatives, there are too many negatives for that to be possible.Picking up 12 months on after the previous movie we are introduced to three sets of people, all preparing for the purge in their own different ways. Within 10 minutes after all lead characters have been introduced, I was already uninterested in all of them. Throughout the entire film I didn't care for any of them and I didn't feel attached them in any way whatsoever. How can you possible create a film with characters that say stupid things and do stupid things constantly? To make matters worse the characters are played by actors who have mastered every cliché facial expression and tone of voice there is to master!The only positive I have from this movie is the settings; the deserted streets at night look fantastic and very eerie and realistic. The people with the masks and their weapons and vehicles are also very well done. They are big and in your face and some of the cinematography during the action scenes is quite impressive. Sadly though nothing else is worth mentioning, you cannot rate a horror/thriller film on some good visuals and an over the top artillery.The twists you have in the film are predictable, the characters are predictable, the ending is predictable and unfortunately the inevitable 'Purge 3' next year is equally predictable. But that's Hollywood for you.3/10",The Purge - Anarchy
143,DanLives1980,An Adventurous Future Shocker,7,16 March 2015,"Going into this movie a year after it's release, I was set on seeing something like a cross between The Running Man and the Manhunt video games of Playstation 2! I waited so long because whereas viewers said it was an improvement on the original, most reviews I read seemed to imply that it was still quite average. On the contrary The Purge: Anarchy is an enjoyable adventure steeped in suspense which balances social commentary with a grisly comic book take on the American Dream turned dystopian nightmare. No, it isn't trying to warn us like Orwell did, and it doesn't take itself so seriously. That said, it does a great job in employing the element of surprise over and over again.Frank Grillo has always delivered as an actor and rising action star and does so once again. He's also joined by a perfectly willing and able ensemble cast of survivors, especially Carmen Ejogo and Zoe Soul who are strong both as background and established characters.The first movie was let down by some very corny acting (villains who were more annoying than provocative or antagonistic). This one plays its cards close to its chest and uses minimalism to its advantage in terms of what the audience needs to know and when. Rather than try to be creepy, which it still manages to be, its strength is in just how cold hearted and direct its message is.Visually, it's most often stunning and dynamic without trying too hard. Think '80s blockbuster action movie meets (again) the Manhunt games. It incorporates that and a little bit of Mega City One and a little bit more of John Carpenter's They Live. What let it down was the occasional dark scene where the cameras suffered under-exposure.Apart from that, great movie. Took me back to my late childhood and teens spent watching every action and sci-fi flick I could find!",The Purge - Anarchy
144,bravesfanc,Similar yet different from the first,6,15 April 2015,"In my opinion, the whole idea of ""The Purge"" is quite ridiculous and the fact that their are people who get caught out in the streets for these 12 hours are just plain stupid. It's not a random day and time, these people have a very good indication of when this is going down. So in the case of our first 2 characters, they are out driving with only an hour or so before it starts. Why in the world would you cut it that close??? But I suppose without that, there wouldn't be a movie.It's similar to the first, but instead of it being in a house with a family being hunted, this one takes place out on the street in the middle of the action. A lone man who is out to get revenge for his lost son, saves 4 civilians from a bunch of what look like SWAT team members.As the movie moves along the plot picks up a bit with random killings here and there and we learn more about our group of five. Towards the end, it turns into a video game so to speak. The rich have bought the right to Purge. They put our group of five into an arena where they hunt them down. It was entertaining to say the least.Like in the first film, there were several times where someone is saved at the last second. So it was pretty easy to tell when someone was going to survive. The ending brings everything full circle and it was somewhat satisfactory. It was a pleasant surprise considering I wasn't a huge fan of the first one. I liked this one much better for a 6/10.",The Purge - Anarchy
145,MattBirk,"Way Better than the first movie, but that isn't saying much",4,17 March 2016,"While it is certainly better than the first Purge, the second one has plenty of faults to make it very forgettable. Extremely weak characters, whom we couldn't care less about, are the main focus of the film and that's its problem. The studios have yet to harness the true power of having an actual 'purge' and displaying pure chaos and mayhem. The movie then, of course, falls into familiar territory with the whole rich people paying to murder the less fortunate, trying to throw in some social commentary and it falls flat. And then the movie falls back, on the whole, family relationship issues, that conveniently moves the plot along. Another random scene is thrown in the get the characters out of a safe place and back in transition.The movie is basically a bunch of random ideas thrown together to make the movie look interesting and hectic, but that's its downfall, it's too all over the place for its own good. There are not enough ideas that actually work and are focused enough the be thrilling. Anarchy is one of the worst 'horror' movies of the year but still somehow better than the original film.",The Purge - Anarchy
146,InaneSwine,Quite a mess of a film,5,3 December 2017,"Quite a mess of a film. It clearly tries to expand on the bigger picture that we missed out on last time - but the fact is that past the initial frightening idea, The Purge: Anarchy is an exercise in mindless bloodshed (as is the eponymous Purge itself), and lacks emotional depth or a coherent story.",The Purge - Anarchy
147,CowherPowerForever,Record Participation in Pittsburgh,5,12 August 2014,"Last year, 2013, Michael Bay and his studio worked together with Jason Blum to bring us a different take on the thriller/horror genre. One year later James DeMonaco is back to direct another edition of the Purge. Sadly, in this outing, we are left with less importance and a rushed film. While I never thought the first film was anything special, it held its own as a different idea. This film simply tries to cash in on the success of the first film, and nothing else. This is my review of The Purge: Anarchy.As with the first film James DeMonaco is back at writing and directing this film. I thought he delivered a nice story and different take on the future of the United States. This film sadly only feels like a cash grab as the story feels rushed and not that well written. The film even starts out with a major cliché that leaves you wondering why DeMonaco would write something so sloppy. Now I never expected some amazing story from either of the Purge films but, that doesn't excuse his sloppy writing here. There are some nice twists and turns over the course of the film. I do give DeMonaco credit for mostly keeping my attention, even if it wasn't perfect. DeMonaco gets a less than average rating for his writing of this film.As I mentioned above, James DeMonaco also directed the film, as he did with the first film. This film plays out more like an action film, whereas the first film feels more like a horror/thriller movie. I didn't care much for that at all. The first film felt more well paced, and kept my interest better as it really sold the horror/thriller elements. That doesn't really happen here. There are some nice action scenes in this film but, even most of those are slowly paced. The acting is about what you would expect, and I cannot honestly say that the acting is this film is worse or better than the first film. Frank Grillo is a fantastic actor for this role, and he really sells his character very well. The secondary actors aren't anything to write home about but, they don't really hurt the film either. DeMonaco delivers a different style of Purge movie than he did with the first film, and while I don't care for the change of genre, he knows how to do a good job of directing a film.Nathan Whitehead is the composer for the film. While I can't speak for much of his work, he did do the score for the first film. Frankly, the first film didn't leave an impression on me in the score department. Same thing can be said here, as at times he has a nice feel for the more thrilling scenes but, then he tends to trail off. He doesn't do a bad job in this film, he just doesn't do a good job either. Whitehead gets a passable rating in my opinion.In closing, I must say this film is just about average, and a step downward over the first Purge film. While the fans of the first film will of course be very interested in this film, those who were on the fence, or didn't see the first film, well there is no need to rush into watching this film. It is a solid rental at best.5/10",The Purge - Anarchy

150,JohnLeeT,Powerful Cautionary Tale,10,24 July 2014,"As our society becomes more obsessed with violence each day and entertainment grows increasingly graphic in its depiction of bloodshed, what is shown in this film hardly seems like fiction any longer. Superbly written and directed, with an excellent and passionate cast, this is not simply entertainment but a thoughtful bit of intense time travel. It is only a matter of time before our bloody minded youth, with horrific video games and cable shows that have no limits on the atrocities they illustrate stoking their appetites, an outlet for the pent up psychopathy will become essential. In fact, the innocent people who are victimized by the rampaging mobs on screen are obviously meant to represent the decent middle class that currently is under attack by even the government that is meant to protect it. The values that made this country great are trampled everyday and will finally be ground into dust. It is not far fetched that the ruling class, protected in their guarded fortresses, will soon throw the middle class to the wolves and sacrifice it in order that the 1% may persist in its luxurious existence. The blood lust depicted in this film is already overwhelming authorities as cutbacks render local police impotent in the face of mobs who feed on the violence in video games, in effect being trained for a coming Purge event. A single evening of cable television graphically shows terrible murders in detail, violent violation of women and children, and maniacal torture of innocents, numbing the viewer to these horrors, crushing empathy and compassion as the imagery infects the weak mind. With this in mind, this is a very timely production, a prophetic film with the message conveyed by the writer and director extremely vital to civilization. We must pay attention to what this movie says for it is not too late for the good people of this nation to step back from the precipice to which it has been pushed and avoid the deadly plunge into the cultural abyss. The imagery in this film is all too real and will certainly be recalled when the concept of something like the Purge is proposed by our lawmakers. We will remember then this motion picture and regret the warning it presented so eloquently was not heeded before it was too late. Right now we have choices to make but time is running out quickly. The mob depicted in this film is impatient and the savages with burning torches are hungry to take the night from us. As so brilliantly shown by the director of this important piece of cinema prophecy, the Purge is only 12 hours of one day in the year. No one in their right mind can believe that if a Purge-like outlet becomes reality, it will be limited to that short time. Once the gates are open, those who wait will not stop. There will be no limits and control will be impossible. The movie The Purge has performed a public service in acting as a shocking warning and it is essential that all who watch the news each day and fear the future see the film to grasp what is to come.",The Purge - Anarchy
151,The_moan_of_all_moans,Boys of anarchy.,6,28 July 2014,"""The Purge"" is one of the most innovative and original concepts that has made its way to cinema in recent years. And i have no doubt that, because of the mass material and potential it carries, it will have a long series of films. It will be like the new ""SAW""; one every year until the public become impatient with it and yearn for a culmination. To say the first film was a let down is a massive understatement and i'm sure the majority of people would agree that it was poor and didn't cash in on its potential. That general consensus aside i actually enjoyed parts of the first film; i thought Ethan Hawke did a fine job and contributed to a film that was a lesion in terms of limitation. The major problem with it was that in the realms of a Purge there is so much more you would like to see. A family in a house trying to protect themselves from being victims to a brutal invasion doesn't quite fill the anarchic appetite of the audience; hence it fails.So after witnessing the trailer it was clear that Scott Derrickson had set out to address that, by taking the Purge's events to the streets; seeing it through the eyes of many different characters. There are the victims, those participating, those seeking retribution, those using it to help their families. It delves into the politics and all methods of the Purge. And that is great. But by doing all that; trying to incorporate everything, focusing all their energy on satisfying the audience....well it appears they forgot to cast people who can act. And the midst of the frenzied chaos, all you have is one fairly good actor (Frank Grillo) and then a host of horrendous actors/actresses (the rest of the leading cast). And quite honestly they ruined the film for me. I couldn't go 10 minutes without cringing at their delivery of a line or just their disingenuous performances in general. IT puts a massive dampener on the film. I felt in no way attached to any of the characters, not only because of their terrible performances, but because all their stories seem so rushed and chaotic. I get that the film is meant to be hectic, but what was good about the first film was that the focus was clear...a family trying to survive. Simple. This, however has far too many characters; this leads them to become unimportant. The film also comes across as anti climatic on so many levels. Scenes not following up, or just when you think things are going to get brutal, they dilute it...wonder why? Maybe it is that silly 15 certificate it carries. See a film like this should have no boundaries. The mere idea of having 12 hours, to more or less do as you like, is enough to send shivers down the spine of those with a vivid and fearful imagination, so why not convey that in the movie? Why not go all out? I will never understand the need to cater to teenagers. There a millions of people 18+ who would love to see this film used to its full potential. Throughout the film there is clear comparisons with films such as ""The Warriors"", ""The Running Man"" and ""Hostel"". Now it might have been done as a tip of the cap, but if not then it is quite simply ripping off certain attributes from these films. It seems, that despite my criticism, the film has been getting a positive review and i must say the reason for that? Well the first film has to take some of the credit.If it wouldn't have been so secluded then this film would have been a repeat of its predecessor. Which leads me to think...what exactly can they do to better this one? I have an idea.....18 certificate? Actual actors with the ability to act? Just ideas is all.",The Purge - Anarchy
152,twpain,Good sequel,8,7 June 2020,This film captures the idea of the purge in a perfect way. Instead of focusing on a family that stays at home during the purge like in the first one it focuses on what's going on outside on the streets. The movie pays off with creepy purgers good acting sequences and a good plot!,The Purge - Anarchy
153,mmuggi,"Same director, two very different styles",7,23 July 2021,"The Purge was a home invasion thriller, but this sequel is more of a chase thriller where our protagonists are chased through town on Purge night. Incredibly, James DeMonarco has both written and directed this film, and it is markedly different from the first. This movie is not that down to earth, so to speak. This may be due to the increase in budget, but results in poor CGI blood, plot holes poor photography. This film is popularly better than its predecessor, but despite the fact that you get more background history, and that this film may be considered by some, including the production company, as the start of The Purge franchise, I still think this film is more hollow , and wants more than it can meet.",The Purge - Anarchy
154,StonedMagician,Average: 5.0,5,29 July 2019,"The Purge (both Anarchy and its prequel) had so much potential. The premise was excellent, seeming ripe for making a thriller filled to the brim with commntary on classism, distribution of wealth, and the effectiveness of law enforcement. Unfortunately, writer/director James DeMonaco seems content to just go straight for the violence, and leave the messages out to dry. While the first Purge film was a relatively straightforward home-invasion movie, Anarchy is an action-thriller, with bigger scale, a bigger cast, and bigger ideas. The scale part actually works pretty well, showing how society in general reacts to twelve hours of lawlessness. And though it makes for some truly disturbing imagery, as before, the violence and gore still end up taking the stage. And that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, except that, as in the first film, DeMonaco seems to be a tad timid when it comes to showing truly horrific acts. Take out most of the obscenities, and this film would have had a chance of being PG-13. If the events depicted in Anarchy really happened, people would do far worse than just kill each other, But no, DeMonaco seems content to just stick with highly standard action and horror fare, rather than truly pushing the envelope. Which is a shame, really, because that push could have been all that was needed to help this series realize its full potential.",The Purge - Anarchy
155,politehere,Finally a Sequel that Actually Far Surpasses the First Installment,7,1 January 2015,"I won't lie. The Purge was a god-awful movie. I would've given that excuse of a movie a 2 for boring me to death and turning what could have been an exciting plot into a typical and tasteless home invasion movie I had very low expectations for The Purge Anarchy based on the first installment and approached it with great caution, but I was pleasantly surprised to see the director and screen play writer have done their best to make up for the weak first entry.What caught my attention the most was the fact that the second entry tried to look more like a casual and believable movie than the first movie where I couldn't connect with a stupid looking long-haired brat who seemed to be able to do nothing except to sit in a dark corner and use his remote control car to spy on his mom in the kitchen and the highly unbelievable scenario where a guy could effectively stay out of sight in what seemed to be a maze or a mansion despite it being a little house like any other in the neighborhood.Furthermore, you don't get that claustrophobic feeling during the second movie with it being set outdoors for the most part. The coming together of a well-to-do couple with a heart and poor people fighting for their lives was also really interesting. We get to see the ugly side of the wealthy people and the desperateness of the poor and the needy. I was startled twice in the course of the movie, a quality that not many horror movies have come close to achieving for a long time. The situation the characters were in and their reactions were quite believable and they were not the kind of stupid people we typically get to see in horror movies. They get scared, they cooperate, they take appropriate actions to survive and they deserve to survive for that alone. The duration of the movie was very satisfactory and I couldn't predict the ending. Several times I thought the movie had reached its conclusion, but I was surprised to be proved wrong every time. I really liked the unpredictability of the story.There is only one thing that bothered me in the movie; the city and the people looked too neat and sterile for my taste as if the city was a set piece and the characters were just way too polished. I would've liked to see more dirt, smoke, dust and fire and more explicit violence like in a proper horror movie, but as I understand it, it wasn't what the movie aimed for.I believe the movie is well worth watching and not many people will regret watching it.",The Purge - Anarchy
156,TokyoGyaru,"Frustrating, Annoying, Entertaining",5,18 June 2021,"Heavy-handed and wrong-headed as this series is with all the subtlety of a bullhorn (pretending to have a message while glorifying the violence and making it stylistic--not surprising Michael Bay is involved), it is entertaining. HOWEVER, some of the characters in this film were frustrating! First, the couple having relationship issues--superfluous and intensely annoying in their completely auto-generated dialogue. Everything out of their mouths was cliché. I couldn't care less about them. Second, I can't stand the monotone, confrontational daughter of the main female character. She's equally as annoying as the couple but almost worse in her ""doesn't know when to shut TF up"" manner. I kept yelling at the television for Frank Grillo's character to shoot them all. The actress playing the mom did a good job, but, I feel that, realistically, her character could have been shot for lying about having a car and I would have kind of understood. Also, she doesn't know how to make her daughter shut up and stop antagonizing a man with a gun out to purge. If only the anti-purgers and Frank Grillo's character survived, I would have called it a good ending regardless. Furthermore, I get that he had an arc, but I understood his motivation to purge, and that wouldn't have hurt his character either. So, it's really annoying that these randos who have ZERO skills nor the will to protect themselves get saved over and over as bodies pile up around them to turn around and judge him in what he wants to do. They're an escort mission no one wanted.All that being said, it was an entertaining if incredibly trying film for the stupidity and annoyance of the characters alone. In real life, it wouldn't have played out in many ways it did, so it was hard to suspend disbelief at times. To start with, Frank's character wouldn't have saved them. And why play up the masked guys in the van only to have it pay off so weakly: just delivering people for cash? Oh, okay, I guess. Finally, WHY, WHY did Frank Grillo's character take the mom and daughter with him to purge...even though they had just been saved by a larger force, a force that included a character the daughter seemingly idolizes? That made no sense. So much happened just because ""plot,"" even though it was forced. Also, anyone who's out and about the day of the purge gets what's coming to them. What moron would even do that? Suicidal people or people with nowhere to go and that's it. Dumb and contrived. On the plus side, the way the scene was edited when they go to the main female character's friend's house was great. They built the tension well based on two different conflicts, and I was impressed.The Purge: Election Year is better because we have characters who are actually proactive, some who are experienced, and basically all who are helpful in some way or another.",The Purge - Anarchy
157,michaelgarykelley1994,A Bit of an Improvement Over the First Film,6,17 July 2014,"If there is a term for me when it comes to movies, I'm essentially a Franchise Man; I love the A Nightmare on Elm Street films, the Friday the 13th flicks, and the Halloween chillers. I've made YouTube reviews for a good majority of the Children of the Corn movies, and then reviewed all of the Hellraiser movies.I'm a Franchise Man.Tonight, I went with a few friends to see The Purge: Anarchy, and, to my surprise, I really enjoyed the film, even at its most shockingly stupid moments (specifically anything the daughter of one of the characters says is a slap in the face of the number one rule of thumb for writing anything: Show, don't tell). To add to my review, I'll say this: I wasn't head-over-heels in love with the first Purge film, but this film really did a fine job of showing us the actual street activity during a Purge sequence, which--if you haven't seen the first film--is when the government essentially goes into a shutdown mode nation-wide to allow any acts of terrorism (murder, rape, you name it) to be performed within a twenty-four-hour period. This time round, we get a bit more in depth with how the rich typically treat the Purge nights, and it's pretty interesting, in my opinion.Needless to say: if you hated the first film, you'll hate this one, as well--even if it is a bit better (by my own standards).The actors do their very best with what they are given in this script, but the daughter I mentioned earlier needs to be removed from the screenplay. She is the worst flaw in this whole flick, I s*** you not, readers. This girl says everything that should be left for subtext and thought. I actually got to the point one-fourth into the movie that I was practically chant-whispering for her to be brutally disemboweled by this insane Lost Boys-esque group of twenty-somethings with absolutely horrifying masks. One of the masked murderers is my favorite imagery from the film (which is a hard statement to explain until you've seen the film, as well) due to his absolutely quiet mojo. The guy can simply stand at the end of a street, swinging a machete back and forth to taunt his prey, and bricks of s*** will explode from my trousers. Oh, and he has ""God"" written across the forehead of his mask. Very intriguing. We also have another character that is practically chapter-and-verse Frank Castle, the Punisher from Marvel comics. The lead actress and the white couple with completely forgetful names do fine with what's inked onto their pages.The film has a ton of violence, and if you're a squeamish human being, you might want to avoid it. But, for everyone familiar--even faintly--with the genre, the gore isn't too revolutionary in its attempt to be an exploitation film.I must also admit that the film's political message is identical to the first film's, yet I feel like the handling of it here, with ""God"", is a decent improvement over the former movie. Yet, this is just as much of a popcorn summer movie as the original flick.The Purge: Anarchy was a very fun, worrisome, other-side-of-the-coin film compared to the first film, and I must say that I had a good time. The reason I brought up the whole Franchise Man mantra was to state this, on a firm record: I want another one. Mostly, I want a trilogy, but a series could be fine, too, even if it looks impossible to achieve. With this film's trailers, I felt like there was no hope for it, but it managed to shock me, and I must give credit where credit is due.So, filmmakers, give us one more.My rating for The Purge: Anarchy is a solid 6/10 stars.Thank you for reading.",The Purge - Anarchy

'Purge: Anarchy,' however, wants to come across as an intelligent thriller by throwing politics into the plot, and what seems to be a mini series type of set up until they finally overthrow the bad guys. That's just not my thing.Random Ramblings of a Madman: After following the long winded plot, and what seemed to be about 50 characters in the film, who were all over the damn place - I can honestly say I won't be finishing this mini series.

I just finished watching it and I will first say that I loved the first movie a lot but the sequel kicked everything into gear 100% more then the original. The story was better it focused on five individuals coming together to survive the night and being centered on Frank Grillo as ""Sergeant"". The action was Top-Notch with Tons and Tons of violence which I absolutely love. I must add that them taking the movie to the streets did it wonders and I don't ever jump in movies but there were one or two jump scares. The acting was very good but obviously the star was Frank Grillo who kicked Ass in acting and just being Awesome. I will say overall that this is a must see movie especially if you liked or loved the original then go see it Immediately and you will not be disappointed I promise you that.

163,heatsink98,Surprisingly decent to watch.,7,21 July 2014,"Short Version: A well-armed man, Sergeant played by Frank Grillo, forms a group with a waitress, her daughter, and a stranded couple during the purge to help them all survive. The purge is a yearly twelve-hour span during the night when anyone can commit crime to get it out of their system, and the government sanctions the event to keep the crime rates low the rest of the year. The group of people has to avoid the fighting on the street while being pursued by armed gangs, snipers, religious crazies, and suspicious soldier-types. Sergeant has revenge on his mind, and that is what motivates him to go out during the fighting. But during the carnage questions arise as to what the purge really is.This film is ridiculous in its premise that the government would set up a lawless night and let citizens kill on a whim, but that might be the point --to propose a crazy ""what-if?"" and then comment on the consequences. The film is full of social and psychological statements, and it pokes fun at real-life faux religious folks in several scenes. Themes include the subjugation of the poor by the rich, manipulation of the media, and that most people are in general evil, but held in check by social consequences to anti-social behavior.I thought the movie would be terrible going in, but it's surprisingly decent. Tension is maintained throughout the scenes and there are some jump-scares. There are a few silly incidents, such as a car dying from loss of power steering fluid, and another car with light armor encountering a mini-gun but driving away mostly unscathed, including all the windows. There is one death scene during an I-love-you moment which is quite funny.Verdict: The film is tension, gunfights, and running from murderous crazies mixed with social commentary, and it's a decent watch. The ending has an unexpectedly strong trope, too. The movie isn't designed for heavy thinking and it's sometimes silly, but worth buying a ticket to see.",The Purge - Anarchy

None of the underlying themes survive the script of this film as all of the issues and theories one could have had with the first are made clear and obvious with this film. You don't even have to use sight and sound together to get this film. Pick one or the other and you will understand the plot just as well as someone who watched this movie normally, if not better. If only we could have purged this film from existence, then perhaps we wouldn't be continually punished to this day with additional Purge films.",The Purge - Anarchy
165,j-madej,"""Purge: Anarchy"" one of the better movies of it's genre!",8,23 July 2014,"There are some franchises that surprise the viewer by creating a better sequel then the original. This does not happens very often but when it happens it is hugely enjoyable, specially when first part was rather poorly executed in the first place. Original ""Purge"" had a great premise but somehow in casting well known Hollywood lead like Ethan Hawke, who was solid in his role by any means, but ruined the illusion of reality and delivered standard 'family entrapped in the house needs to defend itself form intruders' type Hollywood scenario which in the past other movies with similar story lines were made much better respectively. I was very positively surprised by ""Purge: Anarchy"" one of the better movies of it's genre (sort of a slasher type thriller)! This installment picks up the story 1 year from the first purge and focuses on stories of 5 individuals who's paths intertwine on the most horrible night of the year. This story had a special meaning to me due to the fact that the action of this film is taking place in L.A, a place a lived in, studied and know very well. Same as in the previous installment reborn America creates one night a year, were for 12 hours all crime - including murder - is legal! A man (Frank Grillo) heads out into the chaos of the down town streets of L.A, intent on killing thugs as revenge for his son's death, but ends up rescuing a stranded couple (Kiele Sanchez, Zach Gilford) as well as mother (Carmen Ejogo) and a daughter (Zoë Soul) in need of help. There is also a side story line that focuses on the aspect of building up of the resistance militia, that actually understands the true propose of purge as a political tool in killing off the poorest members of the US population, by turning the guns on to the rich people, who on this night celebrate purge by buying poor people and murdering them in ritualistic fashion, the militia finally fights back, understanding that change only comes when the high class rich political individuals spill their blood for a change. Let me tell you ""Purge: Anarchy"" hasn't been titled that way for no reason. There is a lot of graphic chaotic violence here to the point that the intensity of it, might make you turn away from some of the graphic and realistic scenes. The idea of casting relative unknown actors this time around payed of big time. By unknown I don't mean that we haven't seen them in any other film, it's just so far they have been mostly very solid supporting actors. Specially charismatic Frank Grillo who plays Sergeant, a man on a vengeance, but inside morally good that decides to take side with the less fortunate and need of protection. In this role he shows an acting range, which so far was mostly push aside to support the main stars of the past movies he was in. We will see more of him as the lead, he can handle the weight of the movie with ease. It was also pleasure to see my acting class mates from Ivana Chubbuck master class Branton Box as a bouncer and Wiley B. Oscar as fast talking street guy Oscar at the beginning of the movie. They are both talented actors which already in Chubbuck studio shown a lot of potential.The set up of all the characters and their individual stories is very well executed in act one, making us truly care for them when they are going through the horror of the experiences ahead. There is more depth in the story as well, making it bigger, more complex in it's characterization. This film in some way is asking ethical questions of population control agenda by being so realistic in depiction of society that for 12 hours is capable of unleashing their personal beast on each other or those who wrong them during that year, forgetting what is the real propose of purge and the agenda of it's wealthy founding fathers. I really enjoyed ""Purge: Anarchy"" even though act two slows down a little and presents some predictable yet intriguing twists to the plot. The most important objective of this movie was for us to care about the characters and ""Purge: Anarchy"" surpasses the original and creates something exiting and multi layered. I went out of cinema as if I was in the movie with the characters by the end with a sense of exhaustion and satisfaction of witnessing what turn out to be one hell of an experience. I was happy I was sitting in the safety of the cinema and not on the purging streets of Downtown L.A. You will like ""Purge: Anarchy"" if you like smart, rough and sometime graphic violent nature of movie realism, with writer/director James DeMonaco succeeding at and then some.For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",The Purge - Anarchy
166,ihearthorrorfilm,"Thrill-ride that gives you everything you wanted from the first film, but didn't get!",10,18 July 2014,"How could a sequel to a film that was released exactly one year ago be any good? This was the question I asked myself as I tiredly sat in line pondering whether I should just go home and wait till at the very least, it's theatrical release. Especially considering the first Purge was somewhat of a let down for me. I guess it's because the first one was purely exciting and terrifying because the idea was so perverse. It was the idea that really sold the tickets, but the film itself, seemed to not deliver to the expectations. After watching The Purge: Anarchy, it became very clear why.In the first film, we were sold by all the trailers, which successfully put the idea in our heads, leaving us brainwashed and nightmare-ring about ""what would I do?"" The first film focused on a wealthy neighborhood and a wealthy family with an unlimited supply of resources. A storyline showcasing that all the money in the world couldn't protect them from The Purge But in all honestly, could the average horror viewer relate to that situation or anyone for that matter?This is where the sequel comes in to blow the roof off the first film. Where the first film failed, Purge: Anarchy not only resolves, but also opens up a whole new realm of fear I had not strung together under the circumstances. The sequel puts into perspective the idea of what the purge would look like from multiple story lines that are not only realistic and relatable but are nonstop and completely unpredictable. I was on the edge of my seat the entire film, beginning to end. Very rarely do I get scared once a movie is over, but I was a hot mess on the way home especially coming down from the adrenaline high from being visually anxious for almost 2 hours straight!There were so many things I loved about this film. The characters were all very well written, most of which were wildcards and constantly keeping the audience guessing. I was incredibly impressed that the film knew how to be violent without being gratuitous. There were so many scenes that could have easily been bloody and gross, but they kept it conservative enough that it made you rely on your imagination, which often made the film much more horrifying in my opinion.It's been some time since I got this excited over a film in the theater but I really can't say a single bad thing about this incredible thrill- ride. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND seeing this film ASAP! The sound of that machine gun still haunts me 2 weeks later GO SEE IT NOW!",The Purge - Anarchy

170,CrisMovieCorner,"A vast improvement on the first, a very fun thrill-ride!",6,16 August 2014,"Going into this film I had absolutely zero expectations, the first one was such a let down I struggled to even bring myself to watch this one. However the trailers for this had more of the vibe you'd expect for a film set within this world.The Purge: Anarchy gets rid of all its original cast, thankfully, however they do keep all the elements that gave the first film the potential to be brilliant. A future in which America attempts to keep their criminals in check by allowing them a lawless night once a year. This time around we get a full on free-for-all street massacring world, unlike the first which took place in a rich suburb within one household pretty much.The basic plot of the film is that Leo (Frank Grillo) is out on a revenge mission which we find out the specifics for late in the film, however even the most basic movie follower can suss out the story early on. Grillo ends up helping and protecting four strangers he meets while out on his own personal ""purge"" these are Eva (Carmen Ejogo), her daughter Cali (Zoe Soul) and a married couple Shane (Zach Gilford) and Liz (Kiele Sanchez) whose car decided to die on the night of the ""purge"".The film itself is avast improvement on the first, with the first I struggle to even finish it, the second was a thoroughly enjoyable film. Don't get me wrong it will not go down as an all time great, however it is a fun popcorn flick as they say. It's surprising how much better it is, considering it is merely a year later it released and written and directed by the same guy Jason DeMonaco. This next part is a !!!SPOILER!!! potentially, in the first film there is a character called ""Dwayne"" and the actor returns for the second but they do not tell you who it is, he is the guy with the mask on that says ""God"".Overall the film is a clean slate in the universe introduced in the first film, it's a great Thrill-ride with characters that you can relate to unlike the first. While the film is pretty brutal and gory at times it manages to keep itself from becoming a pure gore flick like you expect may happen.

The original was good but was confined to the horror in one home, however now we are exposed to the brutality taking place over the 'Purge' night, through the city. The film is terrifying as each character is trapped in a hopeless situation fighting to stay alive. The director does well in taking this intriguing concept to another level, although there were slight shades of 'The Hostel' series in this movie. Frank Grillo is brilliant and his story makes this film compelling, yet the supporting cast do well too and each has their own story.

173,videodrome1234,Re Purge,6,23 August 2014,"In 2013 Purge despite the fact that it had flaws was totally a watchable film. I would even go so far as saying that I liked it. For one because of its theme, the basic concept is really good and they got good actors too. Even if it was called a horror I don't consider it on, maybe just a heavier thriller-drama? A survivalist film. The film wasn't brutal it just the topic that was that. It was also made with small change, which it made back in seconds so there was going to be a sequel of course. There was nothing concrete when the producers were already hyping it up. At this point it has to be said that the story is totally built to be continued. Then they went about convincing the 1st movies director to tackle the 2nd one and they gave him a pretty short window to get it done that they couldn't keep to in the end, but now finally the film is here. And am I happy? Good question. The 1st film didn't exactly change the world, but it was entertaining. If that's all it was then I'm not sure that it should have a sequel. I would say no. But hey it wouldn't be hard to make it better than the 1st one. The story: A couple are driving home to their kids when their car runs out of gas just as the Purge commences. Meanwhile, Leo goes out into the streets to get revenge on the man who killed his son, and a mother and daughter run from their home after assailants destroy it. The five people meet up as they attempt to survive the night in Los Angeles. Let's assume that we liked the 1st one, okay there aren't too many who did, 'cause it got such bad press, but let's just stick with that for now cause people did go see it, so then if it was liked and the director is the same then what's different to look forward to? One thing it doesn't play out in a big house but out in the open. Is this a big change? Well not really. What really is a big change is that it's ½ an hour longer. That wouldn't be a problem per se but the shorter running time helped the 1st one, less time for stupidity and plot holes, so here all these come out. The film is more drawn out when there isn't half as much action than before and just more annoying faults. There are more violent scenes, but what extra that gave it, didn't end up doing it any good. And they didn't get any bigger names to act in it, so pretty much idiot actors got the roles of idiot characters, excluding a few. Somehow the whole film seems to lack concept. Apart from the idea that it should play out on the street now that was kind of all they thought up. Maybe if someone really really liked the 1st one they won't be too disappointed. All in all The Purge : Anarchy is kind of a pointless sequel and definitely in the way it was made. It was just an average part 2 with the typical ""let's just make it bigger"" idea used. Here bigger meant longer running time and more idiot logic lacking scenes.

There was a lack of connection between the audience and Shane. Also, there was another crappy character called Liz (Kiele Sanchez), she is a good actress, but her character was uninteresting. Nobody cared about her story and she is not engaging enough. Then, we have Frank Grillo as Sergeant, he is the star of the film, his performance was great.Carmen Ejogo performs Eva Sanchez. Ejogo gave a reliable performance and you care about her character. The young actress Zoë Soul performs Cali, her character was smart, strong and sympathetic. The script, camera work and direction are way better in comparison to its predecessor. James DeMonaco is becoming in a better director. The Purge: Anarchy was quite ambitious, but it is still not good enough. The last act was messy and confusing. Some scenes in the final act did not make any sense, everything felt surreal and awkward. Frank Grillo enhanced the film at times, but the movie still lacked a payoff.

178,HorrorFreak1997,underwhelming and boring throughout most of the run time. 4/10,4,14 September 2016,"The Purge: Anarchy (2014) is directed by James DeMonaco and is the second film in the purge franchise. the first purge movie was in almost every way a terrible movie that dropped the ball with its big and interesting premise. it told a small scale story in a small scale setting with a tiny amount of substance. while most horror movies of it's kind lack substance in terms of plot and character development they usually make up for it with memorable visuals, atmosphere and suspense. the first purge had none of those things and failed to be a good movie. but the box office proved to be the deciding factor when it came to the studio deciding to make a sequel. so what we get is this movie. it's obvious the producers and writers were attentive enough to realize that audiences wanted the story to be taken out into the streets. so the purge anarchy was the answer. a film using the purge concept that takes place out in the streets, where all of the madness takes place. surely this would turn out to be an exciting and suspenseful movie with some gruesome and unjust subject matter? wrong. what could have been an action packed and relentless film turns out to be quite the bore-fest.the film starts out with three different characters (three different perspectives) and eventually all three characters as well as their supporting characters join up in an attempt to survive the annual purge. the only actor who gives us a good performance here is Frank Grillo, he plays sergeant. he carries the film on his shoulders and his story is the only story that even matters. the other characters don't even really have a story other than their obvious physical struggle, trying to survive. Grillo's performance is by no means excellent but it is good enough to keep the movie from being a total dud. the other actors, I wont say they are bad actors it's just the fact that the material they are working with is awful. the dialogue is terrible and has too much unnatural exposition. in a movie like this one it isn't expected for it to have amazing acting and dialogue so let's hope there are some crazy scenes with memorable visuals and genuine suspense. there isn't. for a film that was supposedly going to take us into the streets of anarchy and chaos, not much really happens here. it's mostly just gunfights with mediocre direction and laughable effects. the blood and gore are all mostly CGI and it looks very unrealistic and takes you out of the experience. by no means am I someone who NEEDS blood and guts to get enjoyment out of a film. but when I sit down to watch a movie about a night where murder is legal, I expect to see some gruesome and memorable death scenes as well as some decent effects. we also don't get a single scene of suspense. the filmmakers really dropped the ball here and served up a dull and boring film.on a positive note the production values were good and the movie looked good minus the effects. the stunts were good and the costume designs for the crazy gang members were good. also the concept they used for how the rich purge and, people using the trafficking of people as a money source on purge night were interesting ideas, but the film doesn't capitalize on the horror of these acts. they really just throw them at you and expect you to be horrified. while yes these are terrible acts committed by nasty people we don't actually see these acts come to a horrific close. I think the film would have benefited from an R rating but is too concerned with making money and appealing to a wider audience. I am really grasping at straws here trying to find positives. by now the sequel to this film, The Purge: election year is already out and I am sure a fourth instalment will follow. let's hope it's a lot better than this one.the verdict: 4/10",The Purge - Anarchy
179,rolandjordaan2,The Purge: Anarchy - Spoiler Free Review,7,17 September 2018,"Back in 2013 when 'The Purge' was released, I saw it and my immediate thought was simply ""Wow, this is a piece of ****"", so when I heard they were making a sequel, I did what any rational person would do and skipped it. Then last week, with two hours to burn between seeing 'The Nun' and 'The Meg' I walked into 'The First Purge'...my thoughts while sitting there was something along the line that I now literally know what castration must feel like and right there and then I called that it would be the worst film I see in 2018. But, I'm a bit of a masochist, and therefore, yesterday, I decided to watch the other Purge sequels... I'm actually in shock to be saying this, but this movie was freaking awesome! We follow three groups of characters: a couple who recently broke up and who get stuck outside when their car breaks down, a police officer out for revenge against the man who accidentally killed his son the previous year and a mother and daughter, just doing whatever they can to survive the night. Ultimately the three groups band together to survive the annual Purge. Frank Grillo stars as the police officer who becomes the leader of the group and he is simply awesome in this part. Grillo's character asks the classic question of what we would do to someone who hurt our family, and brings a true depth to this character, while still being a tough as hell and just an overall fun character. The other characters are likeable too, unlike just about everyone in 'The First Purge', these characters are all quite sympathetic and all have defining character traits that makes you want to see them survive. This alone already puts this high above the other entries I'd seen previously. The plot is handled much differently too, while the original mostly stayed in one location and ultimately just became another home invasion film, this one takes you out into the action and offers a hard look at a crumbling society. The assassins, especially those hunting the young couple, is creepy as hell. There are lots of slow moments with them kinda just standing still and staring, and these scenes are actually spine tingling. The political commentary here is done much better too, even if it more or less gives the same message as the other entries, it's better balanced and doesn't come across as just plain racist (like 'The First Purge'). Overall, you don't have to be a fan of the original to like this sequel, hell skip the original completely and start with this film, because this is purging done right.",The Purge - Anarchy
180,mindgem,"Fantastic movie, beautiful scenes. Topped the original by far.",10,9 August 2014,"I thought the original had a really cool idea, almost like the classic question what would you bring to a deserted island.But the original left us with tons of questions and I can think of a million cool stories told about Purge night and this sequel tells a great story of a group dealing with the purge.There are some awesome scenes in this movie that made me playback several times just to see them again, like the slow mo scene in the beginning showing the gang on the schoolbus ready to purge, fantastic.I very much hope there will be a whole series, this could definitely compete or even slay the SAW series. Superb. 9/10",The Purge - Anarchy
181,thomahal,This could happened!,10,26 October 2020,"If there is one country this actually could happen in, it is USA.
I have seen all the Purge movies and the serie, and this one is by far the best of them.
Frank Grillo makes all the differences in this movie. He is a actor that you want more of.
He plays a bad ass role.
You need entertainment, you want to see a possible future of USA. Watch this one. Enjoy!",The Purge - Anarchy
182,japegwyn,Builds Into Truly Horrific Stuff,9,20 January 2019,"The Purge was far more interesting than it could have been: this opens up the story from the single location... and takes us to some dael and horrific places.The violence isn't particularly graphic, nor expertly staged: as with the first movie, this is a thought experiment.Had it been made 10 years earlier, we'd have laughed and thought, ""no mother loving' way!""As I write this in 2019... Well, hellfire and buckets of blood, it's just around the corner, breathing down our necks.For real.",The Purge - Anarchy
183,cbak223,"Good, bad, & the purge",6,22 November 2014,"The first of this series I thought was a good twist, new action, horror film, let's face it the Purge is a fresh idea in a world of films. The first film does set you up with seeing how the purge gets its roots, and seeing that every family that can afford it, has a new, state-of-the- art security system, specifically for this night. The Purge Anarchy is better in a way of seeing that camera view, of being on the streets, getting caught up in whatever comes your way as opposed to the first being in the house, one location waiting it out. Sometimes I know filming you get away from the script, and continuity, but in the final scene when Sargent is shot, she wants to get him to a hospital as the purge just ended, she asks "" do you have a car""? Hello, she just jumped out of a car they stole to get to where they are now. Ohh the little things you notice. Overall, it is worth the watch especially if you've already seen the first, I'll definitely be seeing the 3rd, also Blumhouse, Love Blumhouse...",The Purge - Anarchy
184,saudaminikulkarni,What a ride !,8,10 June 2021,This is a fantastic sequel . Probably even better than it's prequel. It's fast paced and utterly unpredictable even with the same premise being utilised here too . I enjoyed this .,The Purge - Anarchy
185,cubsckc,Good Watch but falls Short,7,29 July 2014,"I thought the new Purge really hit the screen at first really strong. The feeling and intensity of what was coming could be felt during the first 10 minutes of the movie. However, as the movie continued and you saw the overall scope of what was going on in society instead of just the main characters, I kind felt like, ""oh yeah"" that makes sense, or at times ""what?"" So in all, I had mixed feelings about how the events unfolded.We are introduced with a few average families. One, a young white couple who were stupid enough to wait 4 hours before the purge. The second, and African American family who locked themselves as best they could in their poor district. Right away, one of the things that was cheesy was another government conspiracy theory about the purge designed to kill the poor. I thought this was a bit more unrealistic than the first. The First focused on a rich beneficiary of the Purge, and I just feel that a) the government gets more off locating rich families if that really was the case, and b) its a lot better to go after rich families because you get benefits. As first movie showed, its only a matter of time before your defenses go down, and even wealth can't suffice against people who want you dead. The last major character we have is someone out to get revenge... we don't know why, all we know is that he has a bunch of pics of the person he wants to kill and him loading up for the night. Despite everyone of these characters feeling like they were set and secure for the night, things get shaky, and their lives collide as they work together to survive. There were a few interesting concepts about the film that I liked. Firstly, the concept of people willingly giving their lives for money for their families. Its interesting when viewing such an extreme world where something like this existed, but its even more interesting when you view the different choices and reactions of the citizens. Secondly, I liked the concept of how both the rich and poor ""purgists"" had different ways of expressing their purge. They had different tools, and methods of completing their tasks. Thirdly, the movie went to one scene where the purge comes out of a family internal conflict. It was brief, but very scary at the same time, just thinking about how some family feuds could legitimately be taken to the next level if it was legal. Fourth, though I didn't like the conspiracy bullshit, I did think it was interesting how the government could use street and satellite surveillance to get what it wants. The way the portrayed the rich ""Purgists"" was kind of cheesy, though I would say, the way they pay for their crimes and act like life is unfair when events don't happen their way was absolutely priceless. I will admit, I had a laugh about that. What I clearly disliked about the film really came from the anarchists and the government conspiracy element of this movie. I believe that half the movie went down hill as a result of the movie trying to force something in that had no business in it. I originally thought the group of ""Purgists"" with all the high tech equipment were either really rich people or retired military/contractors. It seemed pretty cool with all their outdoors gear and interesting gadgets. However... they were apparently the government. Apparently they needed them because society is really nice you see, and the purge isn't getting enough people to actually do it. Firstly... thats awesome! I guess they should stop it right! Secondly... that was pretty much the opposite reason why these purges exist in the first place. This also made a lot of contradictions to the rest of the film. In fact, the first people they kill in the film are people participating in the purge. So its like... we need these guys because there aren't enough purgers but they are going to kill purgers as well. Hmmmm.... As far as the characters go... except for the character out for vengeance, the rest were completely useless and talked a lot of rubbish. Besides for that, I thought that the main character's vendetta was such a let down. I was like... this guy is going to set himself up like that to kill one dude who wasn't even in a purge. Not to say he didn't do something bad... but... I guess one could say that that's another concept about the purge to reflect on.As such, the film at least in the beginning had a lot of momentum. It didn't completely fail but the ending wasn't as exciting or interesting as how it started off. Its too bad, but it made for a descent watch.",The Purge - Anarchy
186,TheMovieVlog,Really good film with some interesting concepts and themes,6,21 July 2014,"An improvement on its underrated predecessor, The Purge: Anarchy is a thrilling film about so much more than just scares. This time around writer/director James DeMonaco seems better equipped to tell the story he wanted to. The moral and political messages are handled with a more delicate hand, and the characters seem to be better written and more important to the story itself. There are still some issues, mainly the conclusion of the film and the fact some of the dialogue feels stilted (especially when pushing the message of the film), but the film is thrilling enough and intelligent enough to be enjoyable to fans of the genre. Well written and acted. Kept you on the edge on your seat throughout the movie. This was a refreshing and original idea for a thriller.",The Purge - Anarchy
187,MarkSaltzer,Much Prefer the Sequel,8,5 November 2015,"This movie is an awesome dissection and reflection of today's society. The sickeningly wealthy preying on the poverty stricken. I guess in our reality, the wealthy elite prefer to slow kill us and fast kill civilians in other countries in order for them to steal the wealth.This movie breathes life into the Class War currently waging on Earth. The film went by quickly which is always a good sign of a great film. The performances were solid, the storyline was well written and the direction and production was executed (pardon the pun) flawlessly. I felt for all the characters which is something I didn't do in the first film. Sergeant played an important role in the film and I would definitely have him on my Zombie team. Looking forward to the next Purge. Well done team, entertaining from beginning to end.",The Purge - Anarchy
188,Ali-hamza-re,Re-Born,7,14 October 2014,Well the movie is not bad it is good to watch to see a human how much it became psychopath when a such kind of rights given to human. Well it is not that smart film or smart character in film but it is still fun to watch. This sequel explore the city and give us a wide view of purge and killing and the horror of different people. Well it is not that kind of thriller or suspense. well Frank Grillo done good acting and a handsome personality. If the film has no smart element but it also not have stupid thing in it. Well it can be more good if it has more budget and more critical writing. Well in film some stuff i can not understand also. Well it is not recommended to watch but it is fair time to spend to watch this film,The Purge - Anarchy
189,somlaign1,"Good, Intense, Thrilling",10,20 July 2014,"Better than expected. You don't expect much when you go into these types of movies. I was afraid it would be too violent and is a slasher type film. It was a bit violent (but no different that most action movies out there) but not gory or in poor taste at all and definitely not a slasher flick (thank goodness). It actually had a good plot and good acting, believable and made the concept more legitimate. It does raise the question of what humans are capable of if given free reign by the government. Does humanity still exist?Overall, good movie considering all the bad execution you find in movies nowadays. Also, it is better and more intriguing than part 1.",The Purge - Anarchy
190,pronetomovies,this is better than the first film,9,4 November 2015,"I like this one better than the first film, they did not stay inside their houses and waited for the purge to end which makes the story more interesting like you will be so thrilled to find out how they are going to survive outside without really much experiences when it comes to violence thing. Those people who are purging in the first film are scarier because of the mask than in this movie although they still are giving me goosebumps especially when the guy who was wearing a mask with a GOD written on its forehead waving his weapon in the air and staring at Shane and Liz like ""Hey watch your bag. We might look calm. You can run but you can't hide"" it's scary. I was expecting sergeant would blow the guy's head off at the end and it was kind of so not amusing at all I mean he took your son crap happens but then he saved his life which buried all my hatred for him. Love this film but it's something I wouldn't watch again and again.",The Purge - Anarchy
191,obispo2000,The rare case when the sequel is far better than the original,8,13 September 2018,"I watched The Purge back in 2013 and despite its flaws I enjoyed it to some extent. I would rate it as 6 /10 in its genre. But I was a bit afraid watching the sequel, as sequels usually are less good. What an error! The Purge Anarchy is a good movie, one of the best thrillers I saw lately. It introduced Frank Grillo, a charismatic superhero, a character between Clint Eastwood's a d Keanu Reeves' similar roles. The brother of John Wick, for instance. He could and should play main roles in big budget revenge movies, he has the presence, the charisma and the skills to do that.
You should watch it, even if you didn't see the first part. It's one of the rare recent watchable action thrillers.",The Purge - Anarchy
192,jeffa123,no credibility,1,20 July 2014,"the purge concept is little more than demonaco's racist/caste genocide fantasy. solve society's problems by eliminating {insert group name here}. the thing is laden with 100's of plot holes and burdened by a tiresome load of clichéd plot devices. exhibit 1: why would a group (white) with the 'right' to kill anyone they want spend the whole night trying to break into a house to go after one guy (black)? exhibit 2: why would anyone be out driving around 30 minutes before the purge starts? so that their car can break down on a bridge stranding them. the intended 'social commentary' cannot be regarded with any credibility. i'm bored with these social de-evolution films (hunger games and elysium come to mind). these scenarios would NEVER happen. let me restate that. these scenarios would *NEVER* happen. again... once more for clarity.... **NEVER** **HAPPEN**. is that clear demonaco? this scenario would *never* happen, so whatever you try to do in the film socially becomes utterly meaningless. there can be no political statement, no social commentary, no speculation on the future state of society because your concept is so cockamamie it simply cannot be regarded as anything but utter drivel. i love horror. i love sci-fi. i have over 500 horror and sci-fi films in my collection. good ones. bad ones. campy ones. the difference between those absurd premises and the purge premise is that those are *supposed to be taken tongue in cheek. we know they're stupid with stupid characters and tired plot devices. that's part of the fun! demonaco though doesn't seem to want us to have fun and get a few chuckles. he seems to want us to take his pile of doo serious, as if it could really happen. and that's where you fail demonaco. i dub this series ""assault on intelligence""",The Purge - Anarchy

I take this movie more as a warning as to where society is headed, not only in the U.S. but in all ""civilized"" hedonistic cultures presently at large in the world.Maybe not as in legalized murder, but the need to ""purge"" definitely exists in the human species. For the families of murder victims, rape victims...the need to purge the agitation (in what manner what so ever) from the soul is a real thing. Whether the purging comes through violence or forgiveness, that is an individual choice. Damaged feelings cannot be ignored.",The Purge - Anarchy
195,Smerdyakoff,Hamfisted Stupid Message Film,3,14 September 2015,"The original Purge was a watchable one-trick-pony film, with a simple plot about a yearly night of no law mayhem. Which seemed to devolve into people murdering others for small grudges like the daughter's boyfriend wants to kill dad etc. It was claustrophobic, since it was all set in a man's house, Okay but not greatThen they recycled the same name and plot element into a film that was trying to be something it couldn't be, a ""social message"" film. Then it introduced an action movie heavy guy, who was good at playing that sort of role. But that just played to the person who wanted a Rambo or a Dirty Harry to set it all right. The movie didn't need a heavy, it works best with just average folks getting by on their wits. Not silly action scenes where berserker's drive down subway tunnels in special off road gun mounted vehicles shooting at random folks, the homeless and people just hiding. Part of the plot line was the group of random people being led by the heavy to one of the group's relative's apartment to get a car. Why not steal one, it is legal, instead of walking on treacherous streets or in subway tunnelsOKAY, one whole night of no laws, you can do anything you like. Yet the one crime people seem to want to commit is random murder. No mass robbery, arson, theft, drug dealing, etc. So they throw this group of harvesters in , who capture and gather poorer people up so rich WASPY elitists, not just white people but Mayflower types, can have their upper crust murder party. Then some righteous group is trying to fight these bag guys! And guess what, they are black criminals led by a black rapper, lol. Only in Hollywood is such racist nonsense taken as profound. Black lives matter, only the few times a white person kills one.But the action heavy guy's motive that night was revenge, on some white guy who murdered his son on the last Purge day.

196,AverxgeJoe,Better than the first Purge,5,18 January 2016,"The Purge: Anarchy is a good movie for a sequel. Maybe that's because the first one wasn't good to begin with. This time the movie goes a bit more in depth of it's yearly title event. The sequel features more characters than the first one, and in this case, the more the merrier. The characters were a bit better than in the first one, but the acting was unfortunately a hit and miss. From a technical standpoint the movie could have been better. Directing was not that good, action, etc. like I said could have been better. At least I feel like it would have been.Frank Grillo was the star of the movie. That's honestly a no-brainer. Not only cause he easily gave the best performance out of all the actors, but the writer had made his character so much more interesting, and well, just better than the rest of the characters.

I did watch it from start to finish which means it deserved some rating stars. It is SciFi only in that it is set in a future where The Purge exists. *** minor spoiler ahead *** The characters are predictable and it was only a matter of time when their paths would cross. And the 'monsters' of course are bankers and rich people... so predictable from Hollywood types where they are rich but believe they represent us. The film presents a simplistic view of the world... but that is Hollywood. If you are looking for good SciFi then look elsewhere. This is more of a horror action film. Anyway, the movie was OK as entertainment so if that is all that you want then go for it.",The Purge - Anarchy
198,camachbr0,The Purge Sequel: Less Anarchic than the First,7,21 July 2014,"Here is how I see it. The second installment (to what promises to be a yearly occurrence) of the Purge was a lot better than the first. But it isn't because The Purge: Anarchy is a significant film. It's because Writer/Director James DeMonaco is finally able to incorporate the underlying theme of class hierarchy that was completely misguided in its predecessor. The big mistake with the first film was making it a trite home invasion thriller. With Anarchy, we explore the outside world during the 6th annual Purge, and it proves, without a doubt, to be ten times more thrilling and suspenseful. We see the nut cases in freaky masks (one with GOD written on it) wielding their weapons of choice. We see the upper class citizens holding each others hands reciting the ""New Founding Fathers"" motto that feels like some satanic cult. In our seats, we feel that we have to look around all at times, because there could be a killer ahead or behind us.There are three revolving stories of people who are entering the night. One is Eva and Cali, a waitress and her daughter. There is Shane and Liz, a crumbling couple with no killer instincts at all. And then there is Leo, the sergeant, the ""kick ass and take names"" guy. Leo is out to revenge Purge. The others find themselves wandering the street. Leo winds up having to protect them. Will his generosity effect his main goal? Can Leo really save everyone? Frank Gillo makes for a very convincing and likable hero. While we watch and the story unfolds, we learn that The Purge, and its purgers, aren't so much anarchic as they are regulated. With it's unique premise the Purge is always able to separate itself from the average horror/thriller film. Most importantly, Anarchy is a step up because it realizes its potential to be truly scary from the realism of its ""legal murder"" concept; rather than just bludgeoning people left and right. Unlike the first film, your instinctive fascination with such a nightmare concept will multiply here, not diminish or turn into a laughing stock.I can recommend Purge Anarchy. Not only does it save what looked to be a profitable franchise, but it is a decent film too.",The Purge - Anarchy

Mostly because I saw the first one, which was a laughably bad movie. But this one, was much better. Acting wise, plot wise, script wise. There was more action, and emotional scenes. It was a roller coaster. It got you to like the characters, it made you invested. The first Purge didn't do much, it stayed in the house the ENTIRE TIME. It got boring, this one had more opportunities and they took them. Of course it had flaws. A lot of them. But, what do you expect? Such as : basically the same character from the first one dying. Let me support this : the dad/husband died in the first one, guess who dies now? The boyfriend. No surprise there. Also, the ending was okay, what do you expect? The purge ended. No big shock their, it ended abruptly. But, I can't complain. It's what you expected. An above average movie. Below fantastic but good. Better than expected.

Going into it, I was sold, I knew that this film would Be awful, and because youtube is the source of evil, a review was gonna happen. But, this film was actually, dare I say, good. Now I'm an avid hater of horror, but Jesus that really isn't what this film went for, which is what I love. It's like the world war Z of dystopian films. The main guy just goes from one place to another, *bad stuff* hits the fan, he has to leave, and that pattern just repeats. Sounds repetitive, but seeing how all of these various groups of people are changed by the purge is super cool.

201,djangozelf,The purge... out to steal your purse.,1,30 September 2014,"This is a movie made to rob you of your money. Watched this ""sequel"" thinking they could fix what was wrong with the first one but instead they have made it worst.There is no real sense in this movie and just like the first ,nothing gets explained. What feel I got about it is that they needed a gimmick to show you as much useless and senseless violence as they could wrapped in a cheap excuse to do so. It looks to me they wanted to make a criminals wet dream in which it also failed cause it was violence by Hollywood rules so no sex or anything linked to that.The ""crime"" here is numbed down to sadistic murder and therefor it takes the stupid way out in something that had some what of potential to be more than what it is now,a terrible story made in to a dumb movie.All the characters are so poorly written it would not have mattered who played 'm they would fail anyway even if named Depp or Di Caprio.But...it is a good example of movie-making in 2014,childish and for people who never saw any of the classic revenge flicks.This is a bubblegum film which is nice when the idea is growing but a massive disappointment when it""pops"".",The Purge - Anarchy

I expected to see carnage everywhere but I guess the budget didn't allow for it. On the characters, there aren't any above generic tropes e.g the tough guy etc. That said, it's not horrible I just feel corners are cut and there needs to be better acting.

Meanwhile, a police sergeant goes out into the streets to get revenge, and a mother and daughter run from their home after an attack. They all meet up and try to survive together in this purge. All i can say this movie is fun to watch. They did not take too much time to develop there characters but they started with very strong storyline with a totally new concept. This 103 Minutes of ride is refreshing. In budget of 9 million $ audience deserve a fantastic treatment and they manage quite well. so go give it a chance you will not feel cheated. and one thing i am sure you can't switch off this movie in middle thats a interesting part.

The only thing i did not like was the fact that it had one or two scenes that were kinda soapy and over dramatic. But except for that, it was very enjoyable. As far as the characters, well the main one has a really good deep performance, while the rest so and so. The ending was good compared with the majority of the movies that came out in the last two years. It was a round movie with a perfect choice of ending. So if you enjoy a nice action movie, with a different type of plot that hasn t been pursed so much until now and with a touch of comedy, go see this one.So all in all, was a good movie. Go watch!",The Purge - Anarchy

206,edwardscissorhands12-874-850830,The Purge: Anarchy,7,18 July 2014,"The Purge was a movie that most people did not like. Pretty shocking to me because it seemed like the average horror movie with the same twists and turns as any other film that people rave about, regardless of whether or not crime was legal. The main problem I had with The Purge was that it did not explore the depths of the idea of crime legal for one night thoroughly enough, so it almost seemed as though it was a gimmick. That is not the case in the new and much better sequel The Purge: Anarchy. Taking place out on the streets during the 12 hour blood bath, we follow the story of a few very unfortunate bunch of people just trying to survive the madness which we see in great detail. I absolutely loved the fact that the film took place on the streets, because it made the characters, therefore the audience, feel much more vulnerable and open to threat, which resulted in the film being pretty damn intense and suspenseful. There is a growing resistance to the ""New Founding Fathers"" which is also an aspect of the film I found pretty interesting, although the delivery of it through the resistance leader acted a tad over the top. As usual, there are a lot of characters making brainless decisions. In one part (not a spoiler don't worry!!) two characters are hiding in the back of their apartment with someone who broke in trying to kill him, and one of the girls thinks it will be a great idea to shout ""We're back here and we have a lot of guns so don't come back here!"" when they have no guns.... What the actual f*ck! Why in the hell would you make such an idiot decision to say that and reveal your spot to someone trying to kill you. There are much more instances in which dumb decisions are made which denote the credibility of the screenwriters. But their greatness is rebounded with some of the paths the story takes and the twists we see that could not have been foreseen. Some of the things that happen in the film are just absolutely ridiculous because there's no way some of them could have happened, but I also sometimes got the vibe from the mood of the film that they were supposed to be over the top in order to be fun and entertaining. The acting is really all it needs to be, except Frank Grillo is actually fantastic as the kick-ass hero of the day. There was one very poor actress which is the wife of the couple who's car broke down, can't remember her name or her characters, and I couldn't help but laugh any time she talked. But overall, The Purge: Anarchy improves in every sense of the way from the original, and I really liked the way the explored more ideas and philosophies behind the purge. I'm curious to see if they make another Purge film, and I hope that the third entry is even better, because with ending, The Purge seems to be that franchise that continues in an upward spiral. Grade: B",The Purge - Anarchy
207,aileselfhallucination1981,Bad logic,5,16 September 2018,"The idea of the film is definitely good, but I think the method of directing suffers a lot of weakness.
The film discusses the human being in the industrial community, and turning it into a tool of balance and pleasure by the wealthy, and the resulting natural reaction is the inevitable revolution to realize the meaning of human existence. 
But the severity of the violence destroyed the rational and humane meaning .. the film was greatly disrupted, and this is the main reason for the low evaluation. but in general, a film remains with a good idea. It is the ultimate rebellion against ""politics, economy and enterprise ""
addition to the traditional idea of the American cinema, revenge, emotions and the triumph of lasting goodness in the end.
The film could have been a much better, but there's a lot of arbitrary and bad logic in the cinematic processing.",The Purge - Anarchy
208,chloeg-25,Definitely much better than the first film!,9,21 May 2021,"This film I definitely enjoyed way more than the first film. After watching the first film, I almost didn't watch this film.

210,SouthSideChgo,"Finally a sequel worthy of a ""10""",10,18 July 2014,"****CONTAINS NO SPOILERS**** It's 2023 ...and crime, poverty and unemployment are at an all time low in this country thanks to the New Founding Fathers and their implement of ""The Purge"" - that designated one night (on March 21) of the year were all crime (including murder) is completely legal. Yes, you can finally hunt, maim and/or kill that ""special"" someone or anyone you've been wanting to x out of your life without any feat of being arrested, tried and convicted because even emergency services (fire, police and hospital) will be suspended for twelve hours from 7p to 7a.""Blessed be our New Founding Fathers for letting us Purge and cleanse our souls. Blessed be, America, a nation reborn..."" That was the premise for the original The Purge (2013) which starred Ethan Hawke, Lena Headley, Adeliade Kane, and Max Burkholder and was directed by James DeMonaco. Well, director/writer DeMonaco is back with a sequel - The Purge: Anarchy in which he takes the audience out of the ""comforts"" of the suburban life during the night of the annual Purge as the terror unfolds around one particular family. Now, he gives us a sequel that features three unseemly separate story lines (at first) but all merging (unexpectedly) together as five (5) people try to survive the night on the streets of Los Angeles during the annual Purge. And, believe SouthSide, it's not going to be easy either. Not with armed people on the hunt ...prowling the streets looking for people to shoot and kill and with no safe place to hide from them. Will these unlikely group of people survive the long night of dodging bullets? Hm ...good question.This reviewer highly recommends checking out The Purge: Anarchy when it opens in theatres tomorrow. She found the sequel way better than the first because it gave you more of an in depth look at what happens on the streets during the annual event rather than bottling you inside a house with a single family trying to evade teenage intruders and their neighbors. You as the audience are placed right smack in the middle of the action ...dodging the onslaught of armor piercing bullets, heavily suited and armed men in black government-issued protective gear and/or crazed masked gangs scouring the streets to nab you for some wealthy Purge hunt club. Yes, there's more to this Purge than the original because there was so much revealed about the true nature and reason for The Purge this time. Can something like this actually happen? Of course, as this nation gradually moves towards being ""one nation under a gun"" (please note SouthSide is all for the 2nd Amendment and your right to bear arms but do it with responsibility). Just as Carmelo stated during the movie ""...we have become a nation that prays to their gun ...not to God, Allah, etc..."" (paraphrased) And as morbid as it sounds, you just might find yourself cheering and/or laughing during this movie like SouthSide did when attending the recent screening. She supposes that she may have been desensitized to the acts of violence seen throughout the movie even though some scenes were intensely brutal at times as well as thrilling. Perhaps ...just perhaps, she has her own ""purge"" agenda in mind. Still, she does have to caution parents on thinking about bringing kids younger than 12 or 13 to this movie - DON'T! Don't be like those parents who brought their 10 ...even 6 or 7 years old kids with them to the screening. Though they see violence and acts of violence on the streets and/or television and video games, The Purge: Anarchy is way too intense for them to handle though SouthSide did bring her 12 year old daughter with her to the screening ...let's just say, she wants to see it again. So does SouthSide.The Purge: Anarchy is one the better sequels (recently) seen by this reviewer ...which she has a feeling director James DeMonaco has another up his sleeve...",The Purge - Anarchy
211,Myusersnameiscoolokay,Part 2 gives more context. Fascinating sci-fiction that'll keep you entertained,7,12 April 2015,"The Purge: Anarchy [2014] delivers the stuff viewers so desperately yearned for from the first installment, to witness the utter destruction and mayhem brought upon by this so called purge. So, we'll have to go without Ethan Hawke this time around (it's a shame). Instead Frank Grillo will play leading man with supporting smart-ass comments coming from Matt Seracen himself, Zach Gilford (Friday Night Lights fame, for transparency). There's a new rag-tag bunch of unfortunate individuals that somehow get stranded in the middle of the killing fields at the worst possible time, ever. Instead of following a particular family we meet several characters (mother and daughter from the poor side of town, separated white couple and a man on a murderous mission whom decides to take the role of their bodyguard and protector).In this sequel, you'll find out a lot more about the context. How do people from different class divisions manage with it all and reasoning behind the government's being a-okay with the entire thing (not buying this). Apparently, the day of the purge is an absolute necessity for human beings. Therefore, bad luck to those unlucky enough to get stuck outside. It's not an ideal situation, as anyone with two brain cells can ascertain. Butbut the unemployment rate is at an all-time low! It's a science fiction so any attempts to delve any deeper into this analysis is futile.Meaningless violence and poor character development, this movie is for you. In all honesty, it's an enjoyable watch. The acting is by no means strong but the situations the characters get stuck in and the madness that goes on around them is eventful and ensures horror movie fans stay interested. Annoying self-righteous teenager Cali (played by Zoë Soul) is the daughter of the main character. Cali is grating and unlikable, so much in fact that I hoped she'd feel the wrath of this annual cleanse. By the end of the film you probably will too.",The Purge - Anarchy
212,final-fantasyxcjo,What the first one should have been.....,8,18 July 2014,"Its a good thing some directors actually listen to their fans on certain subjects for once. You might actually get a really good result of a film. Like if Paul Anderson listened to fans on how to make a Resident Evil movie or Bay in how to make a Transformers movie, we might actually get movies that are worth watching and this is one of them.This is what the first film should have been. You can completely skip the first movie which was a complete mess with some of the most unlikable idiotic people in movie history. You have a great premise and you reduce it to a one house slasher flick. Lame. Been there done that. Its funny cause after, me and my friends were saying how cool it would be if they showed the survivors trying to survive the night. No joke I actually said that the scenario that should happen was a couples car breaks down before they can get home and it happens!!! I was shocked and happy that they would do this story.The film shows how the rich and poor act during the purge and what exactly goes on during Purge night. This time you actually have characters that you care about and you care if they make it out or not, some of the acting is cheesy and a little over the top but it doesn't really take away from the movie at all. The action sequences were well done, and the story is simple enough to understand and if you go into this movie with your brain turned off you will enjoy this movie from start to finish.Sometimes there were pacing problems and sometimes the story tried to be a little more intelligent then it actually was but overall the Purge Anarchy is a fun action, survival film that has some memorable moments and is worth the 10 dollars that you will pay to see it. 8 out of 10",The Purge - Anarchy
213,glennmeerten06,The Purge: Anarchy surpasses part 1 in every way but one...,7,15 September 2014,"I enjoyed part one a lot. The concept was awesome and unnerving but the execution was poor. It was the awkward and laughable ending that kind of ruined it for me. It was so disappointing to experience such an ending after an entire movie with eerie visuals and an amazingly scary villain! That performance could be the most underrated acting jobs of 2013! I walked into the theater completely in love with the concept but wanting a movie to do it justice. This time around there are 5 main characters with completely different back stories you're getting to know. The movie does an adequate job of presenting these characters and you will care enough about most of them to not want them to die. Anarchy's biggest strength is its cinematography. Just like in the first one, you're confronted with some unsettling images of purgers and victims. You actually feel like your a part of the Purge. The suspense of the first one is back, though not as strong but still very unnerving. And it's that which this movie nails! Giving the viewer an unnerving feeling. Only Snowpiercer (2013) nailed that feeling better than this one. The enormous letdown of an ending in part one has been redeemed here! The Purge: Anarchy got a satisfying ending with all the needed twists and surprises. The Purge: Anarchy surpasses part one in every way but one: a compelling villain with a prominent personality is missing! That snobby rich kid from The Purge part one, was portrayed so strong that you loved hating him! He was a demanding presence on screen and was the true protagonist of the film. And what made that ending so terrible was partly because of the end that befall the villain. The strong visuals and satisfying ending in The Purge: Anarchy redeem this lack of a villain.In summary: a must watch!",The Purge - Anarchy
214,White_Prophet,Enjoyed it a bit more than the original - 69% (Favorable),7,2 July 2018,"I felt like this was a necessary sequel because with such an interesting idea like the Purge, it would be criminal not to explore what it would be like out in the streets while this event is happening. The movie does a good job in that department because you really get a feel for how chaotic and dangerous the environment is. Frank Grillo comes in and does an awesome job, turning the franchise away from horror and more into a straight up action thriller. The supporting cast is more likable this time around and there are some really cool and intense scenes throughout. Much like the first movie, this has some interesting things to say about society, but there seems to be a cap to how good these sort of movies can be.",The Purge - Anarchy
215,tyse1,A Step in the Right Direction,7,7 August 2014,"2013's 'The Purge' was greeted with universally negative reviews in spite of it being a box-office smash hit. With the uniquely original plot-line of making all crime legal for one night a year (the annual 'Purge'), Anarchy's predecessor fell short part-way through the second act, when the interesting concept turned into what was essentially a home break-in movie. The sequel steers clear of such restriction by diverting our attention to what's going on out on the streets, portraying the 2023 Purge through a number of different sets of characters that eventually come together in the hope of survival. The multiple story lines introduced to the audience pre-purge is one of the film's major assets, with the film lending a hefty first act to character development thus allowing audience members to know and care for our protagonists before they get placed in the dangerous street environment. This ultimately allows what could be viewed at surface level as a fest of gratuitous violence to become a character-driven thrller, shifting the focus to the people involved rather than what's happening around them.Where TP:A falls short however is with the inconsistent mix of acting and dialogue alike. Frank Grillo kills it as the bad-ass leader of the group, however this only serves to emphasize the mediocre performances of other leads who can barely keep up with his gritty delivery, and makes the extras (who are given far too much screen-time in a single shot) look like they've just been dragged in off the street. It doesn't help either when the dialogue used is gripping at one point, corny at the next, and then downright lazy, making the entire picture a slightly frustrating watch from start to finish.Thankfully however, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses in this flawed yet surprisingly impressive first sequel (surely many more to come - 364 days til the next Purge anyone?) that includes just enough cathartic destructiveness to make it a winner.",The Purge - Anarchy

219,SirBurgh,Liberal Racist Garbage ruined an otherwise good movie,2,10 October 2014,"The concept of the movie is interesting and would have made a good movie. The way they went about it as a political statement and how the ""rich white people"" want to get rid of the poor and minorities is just more liberal garbage. When they weren't entrenched in that nonsense the movie was entertaining, but mocking the conservative movement and painting them as racists by repeating ""the new founding fathers"" 100 times makes anyone with a brain want to pull their hair out.I bought the ""purge bundle"" on iTunes and the first one was okay except for it's mostly veiled references to political message of ""rich white people are preying on the poor and minorities"". This second one just jumped head first into that garbage.I think my favorite part was the iTunes ""extras"" which was a behind the scenes look consisting mostly of, you guessed it, rich white guys talking about how ""other"" rich white guys want to purge the poor and how that's where ""society is headed"" and is currently ""not far from that right now"". Funny how the rich white Hollywood types don't include themselves in the problem of income inequality. It's always the ""other"" rich white folks.Why does Hollywood strive so hard to keep racism and class warfare alive?I'm amazed that I lasted until the end of this movie. I wanted to turn it off several times, but then it would veer away from it's political message and be interesting on its own merits. They should have stuck with making a movie that entertains you and avoided trying to become the voice of the ""other"" white peoples' conscience.I wish I hadn't paid $20 for the bundle but I'm sure the studio and other benefactors (e.g. rich white guys) of the movie will donate it all to the poor. After all, Frank Grillo, who commented in the extras about income inequality, donated his salary from the movie, didn't he? I'm sure they practice what they preach.Now I will ""purge"" this from my iTunes library.",The Purge - Anarchy
220,JoeyCelia,"Creepy, weird, chaotic and the same degree as the original",6,30 July 2014,"My expectations were NOT high for TPA, but I was at least expecting to get the same type of film as the first one. And that is certainly what happened. I didn't rate this higher than a 6 because of various reasons. There were WAY too many characters. There were like 4 ""alleged"" sets of villains that were after 3 different sets of people and it was just difficult to keep track of. A lot of clichés to where... A girl picks up a gun for the first time in her life and suddenly becomes a sharp-shooter. It also had a video game type feel to it. For example, this Purge follows the main characters in the city and on the streets instead of the original being in a house in the suburbs. But as they are in the streets they have to get to various places (sort of like a checkpoint in a video game) in order to ""advance"" so to speak.There are always negatives in a movie but I do have some positives. I have a new found love for Frank Grillo. He did a great job playing the bad-ass. I enjoyed the action sequences and also enjoyed the ""villains"" so to speak. I also enjoyed that they brought back the stranger from the first one. I always had the thought to what would happen if somebody used a weapon higher than Class 4 and we learn what will happen. This Purge also leaves you a little uptight throughout the film, by letting you know how much time is left and so on.

223,rapidcereb,Way Better Than the First,7,30 September 2014,"The Purge: Anarchy was everything the premise should offer. The first was just another home under attack movie, and a weaker one at that. This movie was far more 'creative,' covered lots of ground, and viewed what this scenario would be like from many different perspectives and points of view.The movie actually provided more food for thought than one would of expected. While it is a sadistic idea in general, both the pros and cons were weighed out in the movie, and it did not seem like some sort of propaganda film veered towards one side or the other, as one might of suspected.If you haven't seen the first, no need to bother, as this movie clearly stands on its own. The actors were lesser known, but they did a fine enough job so as to not distract from the action and storyline. It was not a riveting storyline, but was a good layout for imagining what one would do in a similar situation, which I think is ultimately this movie's goal.Was better than a lot of post apocalyptic/zombie movies, and if you like survival genre movies, this is one of the better ones. Also bears an uncanny resemblance to the game ""Manhunt,"" though surprisingly, there is no gore or gruesome scenes.7/10",The Purge - Anarchy
224,indianajones79,Just as Hard,7,20 October 2014,"Gritty, bleak and violent, The Purge: Anarchy did what the first Purge film did: create a tense powerhouse of grimy action and not- so- subtle social commentary.In the near future, America has done away with the pretense of government altogether, and instead has installed a pseudo-religious oligarchy called the New Founding Fathers. Under their rule, crime and unemployment have been nearly eradicated. Their great contribution is the 28th Amendment: The Purge, in which for 12 hours every year, all law and order is put on hold. During this time, the people are free to cause as much chaos and disorder as they please- - and most of them gleefully do just that.The second installment of the Purge franchise takes us to the dark streets of Los Angeles where a small group of people, brought together by circumstance, all struggle to survive the night. But around every corner lurks the lunacy that is the trademark of Americas favorite holiday.Besides probing the obvious questions of morality and human nature, the film also explores the nature of castes and classes as they exist in the capitalist system.Whether you're looking for a brooding statement on society or a raucous action film, this worthy title is well written, well directed and well acted, and offers a vision of a grim future that seems terrifyingly realistic.",The Purge - Anarchy
225,bendy392,"Blessed be a better plot, a movie reborn.",6,15 October 2014,"After the success of the cult following hit The Purge, you bet there was a sequel in the works. Honestly, I wasn't enthusiastic about it, seeing how the idea was pretty stupid. But as I saw the trailer, it depicted and promised that the plot would focus in the heart of the purge itself, rather than the outskirts or suburbs of it. And as I anticipated, it was exactly what I had hoped for. All the mindless entertaining violence you expected in the first film made it into this sequel.The plot? It's the night of the purge and three different sets of characters get caught in it. One set is a mother and a daughter, who both live in poverty and are hunted by government agents. Another set is a young couple who are hunted by motorcyclists, who work for upper class purgers who bet on murdering the homeless and lower class groups. And finally, one cop who is using the purge to his advantage to hunt down the man responsible for the death of his son. Eventually, all characters run into each other and try to stay alive from gunmen, rich and wealthy psychos and blood thirsty government agents. I can think of several reasons why this definitely outdoes the first film in every angle. One, the characters are better. Two, the setting, being in the middle of the violence instead of glances. Three, more things are explained. For instance, it's then revealed that the purge is actually the government's way of social cleansing by exterminating the lower class and low income groups. While it's still stupid as the premise is on its own, hey, it's explaining more. The action scenes can be pretty tense and it also introduces a resistance group against the purge. The main character of this film is the basic action hero, who is like an unstoppable badass as the purgers try to take him down.So with all this, you can definitely say that this movie is MUCH more improved from the first film. The first film was a dull family home invasion thriller and having the purge as an excuse to not have the police involved. Here, it's people trying to survive twelve hours of gunfire and machete wielding monsters. If you're a big fan of mindless violence for an hour and a half, then this is for you. If not, I suggest you get off the street before commencement.",The Purge - Anarchy

The original Purge bothered me for three reasons. One, the characters were stupid. Two, they never did a good job of explaining why the neighbors hated the main characters so much. Three, during the entire movie I was wondering what was going on outside the house.This Purge did a great job of correcting those mistakes, and provided great action throughout the film.

On woman yells into a megaphone while holding an assault rifle shooting all men that come within proximity of her. She screams about how it's her turn for revenge for being picked on and blah blah blah. Disgusting, the fat cow misinterpreted what type of purge she needed. The scene could've been more realistic if they added a bear claw or a doughnut in her other hand lol. The other fat lady is some woman who husband has been cheating on her so she shoots up EVERYONE need her. You could tell she was off from the start. she kept picking on her skinny healthy looking husband for being skinny. But hey I don't blame him for cheating on you fatty. You want to save you marriage, lose 100 pounds don't murder by standards. There is a serious lesson to learn here America: the fat women need to go today because tomorrow they will snap because they can't handle the truth about their image. And fat ladies here's the truth you NEED to hear: the moment you kill one of our skinny beautiful people, you will all be rounded up and if there's hope for you then you'll go to fat camp, if not...well use your imagination. All in all, the movie was a big improvement over the previous. Didn't care for the ending so it lost a potential star for that. Good amount of action, some laughs, death, good enough story. so yeah 7/10",The Purge - Anarchy

The first film was no masterpiece but at least it delivered on what it advertised, this did not. Rather than have the viewer fearing for they're own life while watching it as the preview with face painted kamikaze purgers would indicate this winds up being a bleeding heart, social statement type film I saw some other reviews on here that had my head spinning ""It explores themes of social hierarchy, revenge,etc."" what?!? themes ? It's a movie built on the idea that one night a year all crime is legal that's you're theme! We shouldn't be doing any exploring we should be purging and seeing purgers lots and lots of it not just following the running for our lives with the sappy feel good characters exp. the inner city mother and her spunky daughter, the hopeless couple you cant help but root for because you feel bad for them and the poor mans punisher so hell bent on revenge that he lets his conscience conflict with everything he's been waiting til purge night to do oh and tragic misuse of Michael K Williams (Omar HBO's The Wire)as a tech savvy anti-purge militant i horrendously misleading previews and ad campaign which I guess props to those guys because you understood the target audience more than the creators of the actual film stay out of the horror genre if you're gonna just cash in and not deliver this movie can go purge itself",The Purge - Anarchy

Worse still to probably not even be aware that it is being used to obscure and twist the legitimate meaning of the word anarchy in the minds of the people as an important political option.

237,t-hunt910,More ambitious sequel on the whole delivers the goods.,7,21 August 2014,"The purge anarchy has a less restrictive setting than the original. By setting the original in the confines of a house, this siege based film was only able to function as an effective thriller. Instead of a family unit fighting to survive the in family home. Our characters are forced onto the mean streets on purge night. A couple have serious problems when there car is sabotaged by Michael Myers inspired masked thugs, if only they had the AA (breakdown recovery service NOT alcoholics anonymous) and a mother and daughter are captured by a high fashion swat team for inclusion in lethal posh purging party. While revenge drive mad max inspired loner is forced to intervene to save innocents. More car trouble ensures via armed piecing bullets and our protagonists are forced to band together to survive the night. Tension is effectively ratcheted up by the director in brutal but effective action sequences. Even thought these sequences are violent they are not particular gratuitous. All the main characters in the movie on the whole are well written, the only exception to this being the civil rights leader from the ghetto who noisily interrupts the chilling posh hunting sequence inspired by the classic, most dangerous game. The ending is particular strong in this movie as well as moment when sibling rivalry explodes into violent retribution. On the whole, a competent and well written sequel.",The Purge - Anarchy

239,rhemie,Fail! Not worth it,3,21 July 2015,"I love the idea of it - very good concept, but not very well executed. When I first heard of The Purge, I thought ""Horror Movie"", and sure enough its categorized under Horror Movies. Sadly enough though, I felt it was more of a Thriller and not even close to a Horror. But I was not one bit disappointed!And then Anarchy was released! Everyone expects a sequel to be better than the preceding film right? Its disappointingly not. Once again, it fell short of Horror and scored a Thriller status in my opinion. But not only did I feel it didn't live up to its name, I think it seriously lacked depth. It was too shallow. The entire movie, the characters are running for their lives and trying to stay alive. That's it. There was nothing more to it. No love story, no betrayal, no twists, it was just linear. Except the main character who's out to avenge his son's death - they could have capitalized on that and made a hoohaa about it but noooooo, they chose to leave it for the last 5min which for me was a little too late.Its not a bad movie. But 50min later when you realize its really not going anywhere else, it starts to drag because you feel you've seen enough and there's nothing more to see. Last thoughts: its most certainly worth a shot if you've got the time for it, but in comparison to the first one, its a fail.",The Purge - Anarchy
240,piotr-kwiecien,Another retarded Hollywood movie for uneducated authority/government lovers spreading ignorant idea that anarchy means chaos and disorder.,3,26 July 2014,"TRUE ANARCHY = TRUE DEMOCRACY = TRUE FEMINISM. What mainstream media and government brainwash people about is not anarchism. True anarchism has nothing to do with chaos or disorder. Also true anarchism is not an ideology because it is not based in any political or religious notion. True anarchism is self regulatory because is built upon equality of everyone and with every adult person being highly educated and informed. It's rooted in science and rational. Science is an opposite to ideology. Effective, intelligent anarchy requires absence of leaders of any kind. It is highly intellectually advanced, apolitical system without authority. It's a leaderless system and it may require guidance but not authority. Basically people guide, teach a learn from each other accordingly to their competent experience. True anarchy is built upon coherent and relevant scientific understandings and requires intelligent management of the Earth's resources with sustainable application of science and technology for social and environmental concern. True anarchy requires true science. Unfortunately, what pervades in our society is not a true science but pseudo-science. It is usually an unintelligent pseudo-intellectual ""trickstery"" with no consideration to well being of anyone and anything; void of intelligent actions and understanding of interdependency of all living life forms within our environment. True anarchy can only be acquired if everyone in society is equally, highly educated/informed. If all population is equally very well informed and educated then people do not require leaders because they are capable of arriving at the most intelligent, reciprocally altruistic decisions/solutions altogether. That's why it is crucial for all of us to highly educate and inform each other. Current social structures have been so messed up because they are built upon ignorance. It becomes detrimental to whole society if ignorant and uneducated people try to impose some changes by voting in the subjects they lack of any relevant understanding (simply they have no clue what they are voting about). In such cases decisions are being made (""made"" and not ""arrived at""), based on ignorance of majority of population. These decisions made have little of social and environmental concern. Also, such ignorance tend to perpetuate hierarchy or leader based social structures revolving around political notions. People choose political leaders to think and do the work for them. They always choose incompetent leaders because they do not understand what kind of competency is required. They choose politicians on the basis of their subjective feelings, ideologies, political notions, politician's physical appearance or capability to generate impressive speeches and manipulative promises and so on. Ignorant people are not actually interested in politician's technical-intellectual-scientific competence and if certain politician (leader) is actually capable of offering tangible solutions to social problems and if he/she can actually understand the root causes of social/environmental problems. Almost every politician knows very little about anything relevant to improvement of the quality of society such as how to technologically improve the safety of roads and transport system, how to eradicate social factors perpetuating homelessness, crime and lack of education, how to improve agricultural yield while making it more environmentally sustainable etc. Human/social problems since the dawn of men have always been of technical nature not of political nature. Politicians usually come from legal or financial background not technical/scientific background. Because they know so little, only things they can do is to impose some temporary patchwork in the form of new law or policy. All laws/policies are meaningless paper proclamations which do not eradicate the root causes of the problems but provide a temporary, relief pseudo solutions which generate even more problems. It's sweeping up the problem under the carpet. For example: politicians introduce laws to punish people susceptible to developing addictions to different drugs by imprisoning them instead of trying to eradicate the root causes making all these people develop such susceptibility to addictions in the first place (the root causes would be poverty, unsustainable or abusive parenting, unsustainable educational system, value system disorder in society etc). It's easier for them to infinitely introduce pointless laws then make an effort to educate themselves. If laws were to improve the well being of society then considering the number of them which have been constantly introduced, we should be living in social paradise by now. Instead we are living in deeply more and more distorted and controlled society. People should not expect things to become better if they cannot think for themselves and they think they should elect someone to think for them.",The Purge - Anarchy
241,italianweaponnn,Superior Sequel,10,16 June 2021,"The first film was a generic home invasion flick with a gimmick that reduced the 'all crime is legal for 12 hours' concept to essentially a narrative countdown clock device - a family must survive for such and such more time and the film wasted a decent premise. The Purge:Anarchy rights the wrongs of its predecessor and delivers on the high concept. The characters are thinly written, but played with adequate skill by the actors and a more than decent performance by Frank Grillo as the lead. The satire is about as subtle as a round of bullets to the chest and the film never feels comfortable during the few moments the story calms down to spend time developing the characters, but this was made for visceral thrills and B grade enjoyment. The mayhem is relentless and while the low budget certainly reduced the amount of arson to a few fleeting glimpses, the violent set pieces are staged with enough wit to make this sequel a nice surprise.",The Purge - Anarchy

243,Ryu_2,Pretty Good Actually,8,18 July 2014,"When I first heard of this film, I had no intention of seeing it at all. The concept -- a night in which nearly all crime is legal -- is attractive and repelling at the same time. And the annoying use of ""America the Beautiful"" in the promos makes the whole thing seem pretentious and preachy.Anyway, curiosity got the better of me, and I checked it out. I have to say that I'm glad I did. The film presents a decently told story, sympathetic characters, and, yes, a pretty unsettling look at what things would probably be like if this were to actually happen. But it's not all about chaos. As in real life, you're reminded that the world can be a pretty dark place, but there's a good deal of decency in human nature as well.It must be said that all of the actors do a great job. For me, the most touching part of the film was the growing relationship between Sergeant, Eva, and Eva's daughter Cali. This trio forms an unexpected familial bond throughout, and you truly care about them as the tale progresses. Overall, I have to commend creator James DeMonaco for crafting a pretty solid and memorable movie.",The Purge - Anarchy

It's much, much better as a movie.So the main points, it's got the same eccentric, dark and unusual aspect that the first film had, with the purging characters all looking and acting in an unsettling manner. Aside from that, the main actor is another good solid action star. I think that's where the similarities end between this and the first Purge.The actors are much, much better, the storyline is pretty interesting, the pace is definitely very enjoyable, you won't get bored at all, and I found myself rooting for the protagonists, as well as really enjoying the action found from the main hero, some of the scenes were awesome. And I really liked the daughter, she came across very well, intelligent and self-assured beyond her years.Overall I'd recommend it highly, it has a unique style, lots of good action, and a human element with interesting characters.",The Purge - Anarchy
245,embedrei,Do the average Americans dream of storms of steel?,1,4 August 2014,"Murder is legal during the night of the ""Purge"". Most serial killers are law abiding citizens, just pathetic wannabes. Thanks to the ""Purge"" they can finally live their dream and kill, kill, kill. But there are like-minded souls roaming the streets and a better armed group or a sneaky sniper can stop the nicest killing spree. This is total war, like Verdun, and even the toughest soldiers hated Verdun. So actually only total nut-cases with a death wish would participate in the ""Purge"". Additionally, killing someone you know will make you the prime target of his friends and relatives, it's not ""purging"", it's stirring things up.The first ""Purge""-movie was just a run-of-the-mill home-invasion thriller with a strange background story. The second installment is supposed to flesh out the original concept, except it doesn't, because, well, it really is a very stupid idea. There are a few psychopaths killing the homeless and each other. But the main ""Purge"" participants are: a) Soldiers, sent by the white, Christian fundamentalist government to raise the disappointing ""Purge"" death toll. b) Mercenaries kidnapping random people, so rich, Christian fundamentalist whites can kill them in a save setting. c) Black revolutionaries that fight both groups and save their brothers & sisters. If the main character would have been black, constantly spouting ethnic slurs against whites, it would have been just like the blaxploitation movies from the 1970s. This will doubtlessly happen in part 3, when the revolutionary leader ""The Stranger"" will turn into a ""Shaft""-like savior.Why do people like this hateful and hypocritical trash? Is it a splendid satire on social trends happening in today's USA? Au contraire. If the really rich would want to get rid of the poor, they would start with ending the illegal mass immigration. But instead - of course - they do promote it. No administration likes heavily armed citizens. They want control, not anarchy, no ""Guns are out new gods""-nonsense. Crime is great. If you treat it in a very liberal way, it will flourish until the people will demand all the right things: the abolition of cash, a snoopier and more intrusive police, stricter gun control laws (for non-criminals) ...Is it ""thought-provoking""? Yes, everything that annoying is.Is it a ""gripping suspense thriller""? If you manage to evade the provoked thoughts, you might enjoy the ride. I actually considered part 1 to be a silly, but quite suspenseful ""Assault on Precinct 13""-version. Due to the sheer amount of stupidity in part 2, this time around I wasn't quite up to the challenge, it didn't amuse me at all.250 years ago a prejudice purported that somebody without god would just pillage and murder. As it turned out, there is no such correlation. The ""Purge"" says that without governmental control and persecution people would just pillage and murder. Again: not true. Except for those few poor souls who aren't, we, the people, are much better than that.",The Purge - Anarchy
246,evans-lester,Disturbing anti-White propaganda,4,24 September 2016,"Having not seen the first offering due to its relatively mediocre IMDb rating, I ventured to try this follow up based on its slightly better reception. I began watching with measured expectations, and stuck with it, even though I could sense it was going to be a very average flick.The notion of a national purge, whilst disturbing was nevertheless enough to get my attention and hold it for a while (in a Hunger Games kind of way), with decent action and tense moments that kept me gripped for the first half of the film.Sadly, hints of concern began creeping in as the film progressed that I'd hoped would subside, but as time passed it became clear this was yet another Hollywood offering laced with anti-White propaganda.Anyone living in the US today cannot have escaped the anti-White discrimination that's been steadily increasing in the US, not least by Hollywood who seem preoccupied with legitimising, and promoting racism towards Whites.Most of the characters struggling in this story were black/white/mixed race or Hispanic, and almost ALL of the ""evil"" controllers were White, intent on butchering as many non-Whites as possible. If this resembled anything near reality, it could have been at least understood if not tolerated, but the sad and cold truth is that the vast majority of interracial crime in the US is carried out against Whites and this has been true for a long time.The scene where the captured (and fully diverse) protagonists were paraded on stage in front of an all-White, rich, twisted and gloating audience, who then placed bids on our heroes, was nothing short of racial incitement - and this was wilful and calculated by this films creator. It was at this point I had to stop the movie, because it was clear what was being presented, and frankly I'm astonished Hollywood keeps getting away with this unchecked.This film is race-baiting, and it is not the first time from Hollywood, who maintain an open-wound of slavery and supposed racial inequality for a reason that one cannot fathom, given the social angst that this generates. They seem obsessed with regularly reminding Black Americans how poorly they were treated in their past by Whites, and this irresponsible behaviour (along with films like Django Unchained) is in part responsible for movements such as BlackLivesMatter, that ignore the evidence and statistics in favour of emotion and anger.This film is a pitiful offering, and I question James Demonaco's motives here, because he wrote and directed this film, so clearly had creative control. I could not find ANYTHING about this guy other than the list of films he'd been involved in... his history is extremely grey, which is also interesting...I hope this anti-White, anti-Christian movement that seems to permeate large segments of Hollywood is fully exposed so that an anti-White racism does not continue to grow in the US.",The Purge - Anarchy

I didn't really see the point of making a second one but today's rules being more to make the maximum cash out of a product instead of creating a new one we got ourselves a sequel.The previews got me thinking it was going to be a no show changing the location from a confined and claustrophobic environment to a full city caring only for more...more kills, more blood and less quality.Surprisingly this sequel don't parodies the principle of the movie but improves it making it a far more interesting experience than the first one with a climax twisting ending that left me opened mouth.Now let's see if this improved first sequel can be followed by an even better scenario for the third one!

251,rlyonsii,"In a world of sequels we don't need, did we need another Purge so quick?",7,6 August 2014,"This was the question I asked myself when I sat down to watch this movie. I have to admit that when I planned to watch this I felt like the first one had just been released, and it was just too early for another one. As with anyone who plans on reviewing a movie after the credits roll I tried to tell myself I had no preconceived expectations before I sat down, but let's be honest, we always do. My idea going into this was that it was just to early, and we really don't need to see sequel after sequel to tell the same story over again. Being wrong sometimes can be a blessing. Since Scream, where the unspoken rule of sequels suck except in a trilogy became a spoken rule, sequels have fallen under even more scrutiny than before. When you watch a sequel, you don't want to see the same story, but in a different setting, (Horror movies go to space anyone?), we want to see more along the lines of what happens next? The Purge Anarchy found a way to make you think you are just seeing the same story in a more urban setting at the beginning of the film, to slowly molding the story continuation around this setting. To me anyway, this is what really helped the movie be a step above the traditional sequel. I felt like it knew where it was going and was completely comfortable in the fact that ""all will be revealed,"" so far in fact that it become OK to do some of the same things over again. I was a huge fan of the first one, and I was very sure in the fact that Rhys Wakefield, who played the ""Polite Leader,"" made the film and a crazy premise like this believable. The characters in the this one are absolutely not as memorable as those in the first film, a curse which I feel has followed Kiele Sanchez around since her days (day) on Lost.We don't watch a movie like this to love characters though right? After all who is famous in the Friday the 13th films? The counselors or the kids? Exactly. This film is definitely the next step in the fictional world of The Purge, and a great extension of the way many of us view life as it is today. Controlled and ruled by the rich. All in all the film is worth a watch or even two if you are one who likes films that make subtle connections, and/or surprise/twist endings. While the characters are only given the bare bones to work with as far as who they are, the film manages to make you care just enough about them to really want the good guys to win. The female leads are both very well done by the actresses and alongside Frank Gillo create the only real character growth or development throughout the film.Verdict: Watch it.

257,EllaMentree,"I can see now why it's not called ""The Purge 2""",6,21 July 2014,"The 2013 movie ""The Purge"" left a bad taste in all of our mouths as nothing more than a pseudo-slasher with a hamfisted plot, poor pacing, and a desperate attempt at ""horror."" Upon seeing the first trailer for ""The Purge: Anarchy,"" my first and most immediate thought was ""we really don't need another one of these."" The first film was self-contained and didn't leave any opening for a reasonable sequel. But after seeing a few more commercials and looking into it some more, I decided to give this film the benefit of the doubt and I am NOT disappointed.The film stands on its own feet much better than the first film did, and mostly because of what it's going for. Instead of trying to be a Horror movie, it becomes a fantastic Thriller/Action film set in a pseudo-apocalyptic future about a group of people trying to survive on a night where it's all-out war on the streets.A lot of themes are explored -- Human Nature, Fear, Anger, Revenge, Heroism -- in ways that many other movies don't really explore it. And more than that, every small detail is kept in mind throughout the film.Compared to everything else I've seen so far this year, this is by far the best thriller film to come out. It holds its own and it has a message instead of just being a movie about wanton violence. The action scenes are done well, and the tension is enough to keep interest even in the low parts of the film. Every moment you think is safe leads directly into the next moment of pressure for the main characters, and you can't help but sympathize for the characters who (all but one) don't even want to be stuck out here on this horrid night.I very highly recommend this film to anyone who likes thrillers or action films with a little bit of psychological horror thrown in.And a little bit of a tip? Forget everything from the first film. ""The Purge"" doesn't set up or explain anything that this film doesn't, doesn't add anything to this film, and isn't even worth watching beforehand.The Purge: Anarchy is a great film in its own right and it's worth watching. My only issue is that the first film couldn't have been more like this.",The Purge - Anarchy

It grasps you before the commencement of the purge 12-hour time. In a non-stop fight for life , against a distorted humanity.In 3 words, shocking and surprising , still highly entertaining.Thank you , James DeMonaco , for making it better this time !

259,jamesidf,Purge this Film Away! Please!,1,23 December 2014,"Let me start off by getting my anger out! erereeorjithisw34ifilmjtoeiskrcrapowerAll right. Let's spend some time complaining on how this film was greatly a piece of poop. Just for a quick review, The Purge is basically about one night in America (they wish) where everybody is free to rob, murder with class 4 weapons or under. ((Class 4 and higher is probably radioactive or infectious weaponry)) Any ways, let's start off with our characters.Sergeant: The main douche bag with no motives. He plans to hunt someone who accidentally killed his son in a car accident. Apparently, it takes him to go through the city to get in the suburban area where he already came from to GET to the suburban area he is already living in.The two idiots and the father: Two whiny liberal women who keep complaining. They always say ""GUNS ARE NOT THE ANSWER!"" The father also killed him self to sacrifice for the ""rich white men"" who control the new America. (How racist is that? lol)Mark Zuckerberg and his Girlfriend: Their car randomly breaks down during sundown of the purge night. They are like the two Idiots but a bit more tolerable. The guy is more of an idiot than most of people out of the group.Fidel Castro and his group: Yes... Fidel is literally in this movie, the moron who is with the Superintendent, Lorraine and that weird girl from the Diner in the beginning of the movie. Carmelo and the crew: Michael K. Williams is one of my favorite actors. Unfortunately for him, he played the role of some random nobody who claims that the ""New founding father and all the rich white people"" created the purge for fun. His crew consists of all American men who are Black. This is fine, except where are the white people in that same movement? The Chumps with Masks: A bunch of hooligans shown killing people through out the movie. The director randomly shows them some kindness and shows the audience that they really just wanted to kidnap people and sell them to the rich white people who apparently run America.Big Daddy: Probably the only cool character I enjoyed throughout the whole film. Anybody can probably agree. Who doesn't love that bad-ass guy with the aviators, American flagged baseball hat who shoots a Gatling gun out of the back of an 18 wheeler. The Rich White Mans Army: A bunch of ""White"" guys who work for the ""White Government"".So, we got most of the characters out of the way. The rest don't really matter much. I could care less about the story. I will get straight to the point of this pile of heated donkey remains. This film is trying to portray subliminal messaging by Conservatives as ""Bad, evil, ignorant and greedy!"" people and Liberals are ""Good, innocent and here to save everyone!"" .... Yeah.. what a pile of sh**, right? That's basically the review of the characters and some of the story for it. I would talk about the story.. but... I think it's best if I wrap this up if you really want to see how bad this movie is with its horrible agenda.My conclusion is that this film is NOT for anybody who has a brain. Have a good day, and purge this film out to the curb and stomp on it!",The Purge - Anarchy

261,FilmPhreeks,Much Better Than The First One,6,1 July 2016,"Justin here. I finally watched The Purge: Anarchy last night and I have to say I was impressed. I liked this one better than the first one because it actually used the concept a lot better, had better characters, was brutal, and had a good commentary on the rich vs. poor as well. Frank Grillo was awesome too. He reminded me of the Punisher in how he's mysterious at first, but you start to learn a little more about him throughout it. In addition, I liked how this one was more of ensemble since there were 3 main groups and you can buy them more in this kind of situation that would take place in a government-free setting that reminds me if you played Grand Theft Auto and there were no cops. The kills were brutal too. Yeah, some were obvious CGI, but I still liked how vicious these gangs with the masks were and how they intimidated the group. I also liked how the stakes got higher because this takes place in the streets instead of a house like in the first one. The only problems I had was some of the characters didn't get loose ends resolved after it all goes on and I kind of wished they could've focused more on them. Overall, I enjoyed this much more than the first one and I cant wait to see Election Year. 6.75/10.",The Purge - Anarchy
262,dylanr2015,Worst movie I've ever seen. Period.,2,29 August 2014,"They basically took the plot of the first one. Edited it a little bit and made it about 10x as slow and pointless as the first one. There is honestly zero true action in this. There is 3-5 mini action scenes but besides that it's nothing. They should have given up after the first one and never continued. You expect to be scared and have some heart racing scenes in movies like these. I wasn't scared or nervous about any of it. Most of the stuff was ridiculously predictable. There was a few different groups of people that either get ""attacked"" or wander around the whole movie! Plus the streets are so empty! If this was truly some type of purge streets would be nearly filled in such a big city! There is no logic behind it! At least in the first one it was logical that in area like that there wasn't many people. It was a rich secure neighborhood, people did what they wanted but most people kept away from wasting time with the rich because they though it'd be pointless to try for most of them at least. Here in this in a ""big city"" there is maybe 20-50 people in the whole movie running around outside or that are participating! The people that are out there too are apart of the rich people group of ""leaders"" to ""participate"" in it though, it's mostly not just psychopathic type criminals which you think it would be more of! Not worth a penny to buy rent or see at all!",The Purge - Anarchy
263,samhawkins5056,A much improved film,7,5 August 2014,"The purge when first introduced as a film was an interesting concept and something new to the horror scene genre of films. Sadly, to my disappointment the first film was a complete disaster and completely missed the concept on what the trailer had advertised. The storyline initially was interesting but within minutes the plot lacked suspense and an entire innocent family were put in danger due to their kid stupidly letting a homeless man out of sympathy. The film ended as a very dull and disappointing film.The purge anarchy however was much better, the storyline was feasible although had some predictions with who would die and what would happen next. The characters were interesting individuals; they each had their own morals and concept of the purge as the film progressed. The only minor is that Zoe Soul's role as Cali ended up being a bit too outspoken in the film displaying teenage naivety and some ignorance towards the whole issue of the sergeant. Frank Grillo played a great sergeant and kept his cool with the ice cold persona giving the film a great new feel.",The Purge - Anarchy
264,CultInferno,The Purge: Anarchy-How the first should have been.,8,7 February 2016,"*May spoil parts of The Purge (2013) Not only the main subject- The Purge: Anarchy*The Purge: Anarchy, In my opinion has well succeeded it's first movie, and that is rare that the sequel was better than the First. The first was kinda confined in the character's home, basically being intruded by ""Purgers"" due to security failure for ""Purge Night"". You never really got a good look at what this night has done to different parts of society. In Anarchy, you are taken to the streets, with different characters of diverse backgrounds. This shows the audience whats happening in the streets with no place to hide on ""Purge Night"". It also gives more of a understanding to how sick the ones that can ""Purge"" safely are. The ones that ""Purge"" in the comfort and protection of their home are of course the wealthy higher class.(But also the most sadistic.) Now i believe the the first movie should have been like this because it gives you a better understanding of how and why ""Purge Night"" is celebrated. The title for this one includes the word, ""Anarchy"". It is just that. For one night a year, all laws and law enforcement is rendered useless. This gives the ""Purgers"" a way to kill anyone (Mostly the lower-middle class). Now when i said characters with diverse backgrounds, I am referring to the main Protagonists that we follow through out the film. One being an ex-police officer looking to avenge the death of his son that was killed by a drunk driver. There are two Women in the movie that are family and happen to be forced out of their apartment when they are assaulted by their landlord. The other two are a young couple on the verge of getting divorced, when their car breaks down, and are forced to walk through the night. Eventually all these characters meet and start to care for each other not only to survive the night but personally. Now for a movie that is barely 2 hours, they do a great job on making you ""feel"" for the characters, which is obviously very rare and hard to do for most writers, directors, and producers. The end i will Not spoil. I give this an 8/10 due to not only the excitement of witnessing the actual ""Purge Night' but also because the makers made the characters likable and relatable and their stories interesting.",The Purge - Anarchy

267,AstroZombie82,Huge Improvement,8,19 July 2014,"Add this to the growing number of great sequels this year. A massive improvement on the first film, it also happens to be a pretty damn good film on its own. The biggest improvement is moving the action from a single house to an entire city, in this case Los Angeles. LA seems the perfect place to set the movie. It's a jungle out there during The Purge, and LA is the quintessential concrete jungle. It enhances the atmosphere of the movie immediately, giving the film an ""anything goes"" quality that is quite welcome.And this one is much more violent than the first. People are shot in gory fashion, stabbed, and immolated freely. There are some great shots here, like the bus on fire speeding down the road or the girl completely covered in blood. These kind of shots give the movie an eerie quality that works.The cast is much improved here as well. Frank Grillo is credited only as Sergeant, and he is a badass here. Not only that, but he has a rather nice, albeit generic, backstory concerning his son that culminates in a rather intense scene towards the end that's well acted by Grillo. The best part is that none of the other cast members are annoying, so you actually care for them and want them to survive the night. Then there's Carmelo Jones, who despite having very little screen time, is one of the coolest characters in the film.This is pretty much an improvement on the first film in every way. This is what the first one should have been. In fact, you could probably completely ignore the first one, since this one makes no mention of any of the characters and doesn't even have a 2 in the title. Consider this the official Purge film.",The Purge - Anarchy

I watched the movie in a constant state of mind thinking and putting myself in the shoes of the characters shown in the movie (some of them) as I was on the edge throughout the viewing and forced to rate it 7/10. Its a good one time watch for you will see the different angles of any human who would have to survive such 12 long hours. One can derive a lot of moral from the movie if related the plot in a much broader perspective.

What if for 1 day a year all crime were legal. What if you could kill your rival, kill your boss, rob a bank... do all these crazy things and nobody gave a damn. The idea was intriguing and opened up possibilities for great horror, suspense or even comedy. The first movie sold on premise.This movie however had nothing to sell. The novelty is gone. Mediocre violence coupled with careless characters... a dreary and predictable plot.Anarchy needed more thrills to exceed the first. Anarchy seems to have been made with cash-in motives.

It says: 'Your even free to murder'. In doing so it splits the world into the good and the evil. Basically Americans that want to live and American who want to kill other Americans.Now you would think perhaps, with just two hours to go, the streets would be empty. But no, a young couple are out shopping. Personally anyone who leaves it that late to do their shopping deserve what they get. On the way home rather than discuss the mayhem which is just about to be unleashed on their city they chat about their relationship. Who would do that? Seriously? No one that's who. Only actors in a daft film where the script writer has no imagination. The film went on in this vain. People acting, not as real people would act, but only as actors would act playing real people. Its a film written and directed by people who have been brought up on watching too much crap TV. The film doesn't examine the morality of the topic. Nor does it attempt to set out any moral arguments, good or bad. It also fails to make any social comment. It was, in short, a work of fantasy. Lots of people being killed.

Yeah!It has a nice ""The Warriors"" feel to it. Crazy gangs, protagonists running through the streets for safety. Really a 7.5 for me because the last 10 minutes kind of lost it a bit. Omar from the Wire was OK but I wish his character had something else to offer other than shouting. I did think the main bad ass had a good acting moment in the other father's bedroom though. I hope there is another one that has a bit less focus on class structure(the rich people at the end was nice but came off as obvious somehow.). I also hope there is bit for focus on chaotic violence.

It's true, might be some collateral damage and innocent people might get killed. But in a damn war ( which no one believes in except a f...king politician) lots and lots of innocent dies, if you think about it, the good people are doing everything possible to protect themselves without harming others, while the violent ones are there on the streets searching for a victim.

The Purge: Anarchy fixed that by making the main character a total BA! There's something about a kick butt soldier type guy who protects a bunch of weak helpless people that just makes me want to root for him all the way. Needless to say, Frank Grillo MADE this movie. Four people are stranded on the streets on purge night: a mother and daughter, and an arguing couple. Normally they would have been chewed up and spit out, but they are saved by Frank Grillo, who is playing an unnamed sergeant who looks like he's straight out of an action flick. The whole movie is basically this awesome individual protecting the others with his sick skills, but there are some twists and turns in the movie that will make you understand the title. Grillo aside, the main thing that sets this movie apart from the first is that it takes place on the streets instead of one house. This opens up a plethora of possibilities, and you really get to see how freaky people can be on a night where all crime is legal.

In the original, we only see what the Purge is like from the opening credits. In Anarchy we see the Purge from the front lines, watching people ""unleash the beast.""The suspense begins to build relatively quickly, with the first 10 minutes or so being the slowest part just showing us the players. Even when it seems like things have quieted down, it doesn't take long for the main characters to start running for their lives again and again.With the increase in thrills there is a huge increase in violence. The Freaks in the original Purge used relatively low class weapons. In Anarchy, purgers use up to class 4 weapons, and people familiar with these know what they can do to the human body. The language is what you would expect to hear in an R rated movie, with it more frequently used than the first Purge.You don't need to see the first Purge to watch this movie.

So the group is running away, but one of them is like ""we can't make it."" so he pulls out his gun and drops behind a wall and the other is cowering as he shoots at the buggy but then he gets shot so the other person is like ""ohmagod what do i do?"" and he's like ""keep shooting!"" So then the buggy driver is dead and it blows up in a fireball.Literally a cartoon. It's like the video game Borderlands, it's fun shooting up the place, but the writing is paper-thin and amateurish. But the counter-argument is that it's just a formulaic ""horror"" movie (though it isn't) and people come to watch it for the formula and not the writing.It just doesn't sit well with me. There's this rebel leader who seems to address the nation on the television, hacking into the government communications, but this character's entire purpose is only to be a handmaiden to the plot. He would talk abstractly as if there was depth to the world of the movie, but in this movie nothing exists beyond exactly what is on the screen.But fortunately, the movie doesn't have the talent to mean anything, so people who enjoy it will enjoy it for the fun and nobody will feel the need to talk about how stupid and impossible the whole idea is.So this is one of those movies that's so bad that it can be entertaining.",The Purge - Anarchy

284,mjack421,"The Purge: Anarchy is not flawless, but a clear improvement over the first",7,20 July 2014,"2013′s The Purge was a film with a lot of potential, armed with an intriguing premise and relative star power in Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey. Unfortunately, that potential went untapped in many areas, mainly due to terrible characters/pitiful acting from all involved (save Headey, Hawke, and the main baddie), and a misstep in marketing that made the film look like a predominant horror, but was actually more of a science fiction thriller with slight horror tinges. Still, it made a ton of money off a 3 million budget, and a sequel was immediately green-lit. So, does The Purge: Anarchy rewrite all of the fails of the first? Not exactly, but it is much better in comparison.The same premise found in the original is found here, and to some, there is no accepting the ""fact"" that this mayhem somehow makes the world a better place. At this point in time, this fact is what the franchise is built upon, and if you are unable to suspend disbelief, save your time and watch something else. Part of the reason why the first failed, in my opinion, had nothing to do with the premise. Instead, the failure was a direct result of funneling its juicy mythology into nothing more than a home invasion setting. Luckily, Anarchy avoids this mistake by taking to the streets.With the change to an outdoor setting, we finally get a feel as to how the Purge may play out for those unlucky enough to find shelter. Immediately, this makes the event more intriguing and more frightful, because it is ever-changing, compared to a static setting. The movie is definitely not a horror, but more tension is present here as opposed to the first, simply due to the shift in surroundings. This truly feels like an unique event.The story at the core of The Purge: Anarchy is one of survival in the face of an extremely undesirable situation, but there are a few societal issues it touches upon, some more heavy handed than others. Class warfare, government secrecy, nonviolence, vigilantism, and more are clearly referenced here. It can get tired in points, only because it has been seen before, but it isn't a huge deterrent to the film. But, there are some missed opportunities within the story that could have solidified this as a compelling piece of science fiction thriller.There is a huge resistance, led by a man named Carmelo (Michael K. Williams), who evokes some of Malcolm X mixed with a bit of Jim Jones. He and his organization initially look to be a sizable part of the happenings in the film, but end up just coming and going, and it is a damn shame. What is also sort of disappointing is the (slight SPOILERS) lack of anarchy. For one night, The Purge would appear to ""level"" the playing field, so to speak. Instead, it is more of the same, which is probably the point the movie is trying to make, but I can't help but wish that it went another direction (END SPOILERS).Though the movie follows five characters, the singular one that makes the movie worth viewing is Frank Grillo's. Leo is a man that is driven by revenge, and it would have been really easy to make him an unlikable character with no redeeming qualities. Thankfully, Grillo plays the character essentially from a chaotic good alignment, and unequivocally nails the uneasiness his character has during the Purge, while simultaneously realizing that the only path to vengeance is dependent on eliminating his target. Additionally, he brings a real physicality and grit to the role that meshes perfectly with the urban locale. There have been better performances this year in cinema, but Grillo's deserves recognition.The rest of the cast? Well, they are more of a mixed bag, ranging from OK to sub-par. Generally, the females fall in the former category, not truly able to add any substance of note aside from being scared or snapping back verbally. They are not bad performances, but not ones that you will remember either. One that will be remembered for all of the wrong reasons is the man who plays Shane (Zach Gilford). Shane for the bulk of the movie comes off as an aloof jerk and smart-ass with no real motivation as to why. Definitely a misstep by the writer, but the actor does himself no favors as well. The movie does attempt to redeem his character, but it is too little too late.Anarchy is primarily written and directed once again by James DeMonaco, who manages to effectively flesh out the world and the Purge itself. Everything is just more tighter in this installment, from pacing to back story. Not to be forgotten about are the surprisingly solid action set pieces. Whether hand to hand or firearm based, the scenes are filmed with great precision and sound just like they should, all while not being overly gratuitous.Its premise may always be cooler than its end result, but it is clear that The Purge: Anarchy really is a step above its predecessor. mainly because it finally carves out its own identity. So enjoy your right to purge, it's more memorable this time around.",The Purge - Anarchy
285,luckywarrior4,Better than the first,6,4 August 2014,"Both Purge movies have intriguing ideas, but the execution has been lackluster in both films. In Anarchy, we are presented with a group of survivors, a couple that want to split up, a mother and daughter, and a hardcore survivalist, Leo. They roam the streets of LA, trying to get to a safe place while murderers everywhere try to kill them. This provides for some tense scenes and there is a plot twist sort of near the end which was kinda cool. However, there are too many clichés as well as not enough explanation which doesn't make the film stick with you. My biggest question is, of course: WHY ISN'T ANYONE ROBBING STORES? The only crime that is tackled here is murder, and we get no motives from any of the ""purgers"" in the movie. Well we do get one, but he decides not to kill anyways. The rules of the Purge are never really made clear and also some plot holes are never addressed, such as 1)Why don't people leave the country? 2)So you're telling me that a criminal will wait until the Purge to start killing? How do they keep track? I don't think people would wait until the Purge to start. The Purge starts at 7, so how does the government know if someone commits a crime at 6:50? 3)Who elected these ""founding fathers"" and why didn't any of the other countries intervene? and 4)What about people actually in the hospital during the Purge? Can doctors kill their patients? Too many inaccurate scenes too, like in the end when they're at the hospital, there is nobody else in sight. I think people would be lining up for blocks to try to get medical treatment. All in all, better than the first, but still some themes and plot mechanics that need to be explored.",The Purge - Anarchy

On the other hand having seen the first Purge i can't help but notice the frequent similarities. One of the main reasons i enjoyed the first Purge was the difference in narrative from conventional action/thriller movies. The Purge: Anarchy adopts the same narrative with little alterations to the series of events that take place. The movie also has a typical action style ending. i feel that the ending seen in the first Purge was better in the sense of emotional tires to characters. But having said this, the film is directed will and an overall good movie to watch.",The Purge - Anarchy

Like WOW! I thought this movie was just going to be random people going around killing people with excessive gore for the sake of intense violence with one main character trying to just survive the whole movie. But no way was it just that! Surprises come out of nowhere in certain parts in the movie that make the movie so much better! There are a bunch of moments where there is intensity and suspense, but then, there are moments that are sad and moments that make you smile. This is one of the best suspense thriller movies I have ever seen and I extremely recommend it.",The Purge - Anarchy
288,Torontoronto,Better than the first Purge,7,20 July 2014,"I personally found this movie better than the first. The general concept of this movie is better and it allows the viewer to see the mayhem and violence that ensues in the streets on Purge night. There are a lot of really unsettling scenes but I don't believe the violence was very over the top. The story essentially follows your general horror/thriller formula (group of people who come together to try and survive) and does have its fair share of cliché scenes. I believe those are balanced out by the unsettling scenes the movie has. I personally wasn't impressed by the ending as it was more or less predictable. But the doors are open for a sequel (or many) in the Purge franchise. This movie goes a bit more into detail about the New Founding Fathers of America (the ones responsible for the annual Purge) and what their intentions are and backlash from Rebel groups in America. The next sequel should be a prequel, if anything, and should show the unpreparedness, disaster and clean up of the very first Purge. I feel like that would be fitting.I can see the Purge series going to way of the Saw franchise (a movie every year with some being decent and some not so decent). This movie was made on a $9 million budget it will most likely make 10 times that at the Box Office. Studios will take advantage of that!7/10 for the Purge Anarchy.",The Purge - Anarchy

I saw the first movie, and it easily went in my top 20 worst movies of all time. Now we get a second round, this time with no big names, and even more stupidity.Like the dumbest idea for a movie was not enough (to legalize crime for a day), now we are adding more propaganda elements, like the word ""Anarchy"", and linking it to chaos, terror and a bunch of hooligans going around smashing and destroying things.What's even more sad is that at the moment this ""movie"" has done a 28 million box office, and is rated as 7.1/10 from 2.7k users...

But on the other hand the movie was not a slasher like saw or else, it was partly cruel and emotional. When I noticed there was a sequel I thought, nah. Some people you get a connection with throughout the movie will get killed and that not in a nice way! But anyway, i gave it a try because nothing else came up.Boy, was I annoyed, when i realized the only character in the movie I don't want a connection with has to last till the last scene! This nosy daughter Cali, a self promoted freedom fighter, probably vegan terrorist as well which can't stop shutting her mouth almost throughout every scene. For example the group is walking silently through the streets to get not caught, Cali has to ask their savior Sergeant ""why"" and ""where"" and ""who"" and ""what"". Even when he tells her directly to shut the duck up, she starts annoying a few minutes later. I don't want to complain all about her. The rest of the movie was in my opinion not a masterpiece, but a good thrill. It seemed that all the time, when I got back in to the story, little miss knows-it-all came up an started her field trip in morality. Even if they got finally caught by the collector-group, she just has to ask ""how did you find us?"" Yeah, right. when you know, you get killed soon this is all you want to know...

How come the couple that shows up in the first period of the movie could not find any place but the car? There are so many questions.

While the acting wasn't superb, it wasn't the worst, and definitely far from the worst for a sequel. The movie is mildly suspenseful but some of the character motivations and connections come across weak.What really takes away from it all is the obscene political correctness. The anti-purge heroes are all black, everyone bad is old and white, and everyone poor or struggling is black/latino. The purge is created to wipe out the poor (read Black) population to transfer wealth back to the top (?)

I'll admit that the first Purge movie was, for the most part, mediocre and not the best start to the series. But James DeMonaco has heard and answered our cries and made dramatic improvements to the second installment. Whereas the first film was merely violence for the sake of violence, Anarchy has a gripping plot line, dynamic setting, an unbelievable amount of character development, and a suspense factor that keeps you guessing right down to the last five minutes!

It was more of a home invasion movie that didn't explore all different facets a purge would entail. The sequel improves on almost all areas of the original. I'm sure i wasn't alone in thinking of several different what if? scenarios when watching the first film. This is thoroughly explored in The Purge: Anarchy. The strength of this movie lies in exploring themes. Vengeance, greed, class warfare and heroism is ticked of the list in potent and gory ways. At the end you're left with a satisfied feeling. The acting was good, Frank Grillo was a treat as the tough guy, everyone else do their job throughout. One thing i was missing was added mini episodes about some of the people participating in the purge. I think it could have added some nice context as to the why of purging...

It's a pity they didn't make this movie first as the reputation of the first one can make a lot of people hesitant , including me at first. Don't be hesitant it is definitely worth a watch. Unlike the first one. The Purge:Anarchy actually focuses more about the actual purge and various events outdoors rather than one family in a house. Plenty of action and interesting characters. There is one or too jump scares but nothing too extreme, I wouldn't classify this as a horror, more of a thriller-action.

309,khdeir2002,v.good but the end was poor,7,12 October 2014,"meaning less for the end scene why the hell he did not kill the aim. Here is how I see it. The second installment (to what promises to be a yearly occurrence) of the Purge was a lot better than the first. But it isn't because The Purge: Anarchy is a significant film. It's because Writer/Director James DeMonaco is finally able to incorporate the underlying theme of class hierarchy that was completely misguided in its predecessor. The big mistake with the first film was making it a trite home invasion thriller. With Anarchy, we explore the outside world during the 6th annual Purge, and it proves, without a doubt, to be ten times more thrilling and suspenseful. We see the nut cases in freaky masks (one with GOD written on it) wielding their weapons of choice. We see the upper class citizens holding each others hands reciting the ""New Founding Fathers"" motto that feels like some satanic cult. In our seats, we feel that we have to look around all at times, because there could be a killer ahead or behind us.There are three revolving stories of people who are entering the night. One is Eva and Cali, a waitress and her daughter. There is Shane and Liz, a crumbling couple with no killer instincts at all. And then there is Leo, the sergeant, the ""kick ass and take names"" guy. Leo is out to revenge Purge. The others find themselves wandering the street. Leo winds up having to protect them. Will his generosity effect his main goal? Can Leo really save everyone? Frank Gillo makes for a very convincing and likable hero.

The result? This good movie. Frank Grillo is a real plus in the movie, hope to see him in the 3rd on the ""against the purge"" side.In my opinion, the movie is a solid 7 but the addition of the fight between social classes subtract 1 point, is evident that is not matter of money is matter of how many psychos are in your city. Despite the fact that in the first movie there was a rich family in danger, ironically the family of the guy who makes these easy-to-hack barricades, lol, and the fact that who is really behind the purge is the government, so it basically could be a fight between people who don't agree with the purge vs the government vs the crazy nuts of that night.But still a good movie.What to expect for the 3rd?

Gilford's unsympathetic performance as Zach is sure to have the audience rooting for someone to purge him pronto.It's also worth noting that DeMonaco does a pretty fine job of assembling an inventively menacing rogue's gallery of villains of varied economic circumstance as well as some niftily Mad Max-ian modes of transportation.But it's the plotting, including a number of unexpected twists and turns throughout, that raises the film above the expected blood fest and for that, we must be grateful.",The Purge - Anarchy

This was instead an awesome action- thriller very much reminiscent of cheap-in-an-awesome-way dystopian 80s action films such as ""Escape From New York"", ""The Warriors"", ""They Live"", and the Death Wish series. It seemed like something John Carpenter might have done if his 1980s self was transported to today's world and given a solid budget, very politically timely but also fun and thrilling on its own merits through the various set-pieces and performances, ESPECIALLY those of Frank Grillo (who channels Kurt Russell as your typical morally- gray old-school action lead) and Michael K.

The main protagonist wishes to purge a wrong done to him, others advise that retribution will not bring him peace and is not justice. It also presents the purge as a means for the elite to control and financially benefit from the poor.

With the clash of this uprising and the governments view points out line the violence which will commence within the film but for two different reasons.The Purge Anarchy is more of an action film rather than a horror. The only frightening part is that it feels that one day it could happen in real life to control crime levels and poverty (which reverts back to the power and wealth within the film).

Wasted $20, Wasted Time, Would not recommend to anyone. This movie wasn't eye-opening. I mean, the premise behind the movie is unique and interesting, but the way it's portrayed is a little strange. I mean, after six years, most people have accepted and almost enjoy the purge? I feel like they should still be adapting to it. As for the characters, what was the couple doing out even close to when the purge was going to start?

Well it is not new in Hollywood that we get to see such awful shows, but what makes me wonder about the movie makers is that they really don't learn and after all the education process they go through in order to be movie makers, they simply fail to understand the most basic necessities in movie making, we are living in 2014 and we love to call ourselves modern and civilized but when a piece of crap like this is made, it makes me feel the people responsible for this anarchy should go back to primary school to get another chance to learn some basics of life as I have no doubt in my mind they are uncivilized brutes who reached to that level by cheating and corruption. How many times have critics and people alike used the word cliché in a negative way? but yet we have cliché full crap thrown at us every single time. Who are the people who like this movie makes me wonder about what is in their heads? Probably coconut husk! Alarming times have arrived. A 6.6 rating for a movie like this would mean 12 Angry men should get the rating of at least 90, and scale should be 100. Otherwise this rating is a fabrication, a lie, a disgrace, a failure.

321,harrywatson744,Best,10,18 July 2014,"""Stay safe,"" ""stay safe,"" ""stay safe."" It's the mantra everyone intones to each other as the hours tick down to the sixth annual purge — 12 hours in which all types of government-sanctioned mayhem, up to and including murder — takes place in the good ol' near-future U.S. of A.It's also the mantra adopted by writer/director James DeMonaco, whose modestly budgeted high-concept thriller of 2013 made close to $100 million.So this time DeMonaco has ditched the idea of hiring a big name star (Ethan Hawke starred in the original) in favour of a whole slew of nobodies-you've-ever-heard-of. He's also expanded the action from a monster home in a tony subdivision to an inner city L.A. setting, featuring a far more varied panoply of baddies.DeMonaco's script also continues to tout the whole moral dilemma thing — is the purge a very good thing, as the government suggests, or is it a very bad thing? — along with the class/race wars angle, as in poor people mostly of colour are much likelier to be purged than mostly Caucasian rich people.And guess what? By cleaving to the formula that made last year's film such a surprise box office success, DeMonaco has actually made a better film, more intricately plotted, more suspenseful and ultimately more satisfying.",The Purge - Anarchy
322,travisliasjo1,Good thriller,7,18 July 2014,"The Purge: Anarchy was an enjoyable movie. Do I consider it a horror movie? No. It was more of an action/thriller with some creepy factors then it was ""scary"". It was the same feeling as the first Purge movie, but with more purgers to kill the small cast the movie focuses on. The acting was acceptable, they did their job. Frank Grillo really carried the movie, his character was bad ass and he was very good in the role. Some parts of the movie were predictable and there was some shaky-cam that got annoying, but overall this movie if worth watching. My advice for watching this movie would be to watch it with the mindset of having fun with it. Don't see it and expect a flawless Oscar award winning movie, because you will be disappointed. See it and have fun with it, because it is a fun movie and has some great action scenes and some bad ass chases. Overall 7/10",The Purge - Anarchy
323,RealTalkMovieReviews,"Good on paper, not a good movie",2,20 July 2014,"Last years Purge movie was a disappointment. Personally I wanted to see what was actually going on during The Purge compared to the home invasion scenario we've all seen before. ""The Purge: Anarchy"" brings hope to viewers. The previews show that it will display what actually happens in the inner city on ""Purge Night"". The main character is The Sergeant, which we don't even know that until the end of the movie. I think it's strange that here's this guy who's the main character, but yet we don't know anything about him. The other characters you honestly don't even care about because there is no character building. One of the characters die in a shoot out, and I didn't feel any remorse. It was like ""Ok lets move on so we can get this over with"". There are so MANY plot twist it's crazy. I know you're supposed to keep the viewer on edge, but they went over the top with it. Also, for being a horror movie it wasn't scary. They tried to implement jump scares, by the time it happened, you already knew it was coming. The acting wasn't all the way there either. Seriously, I don't know anyone who can shoot a fully automatic assault rifle with one hand and NEVER reload it. I couldn't really believe the character roles just because they were to cheesy. Here's this guy who wants revenge, here's this couple who just so happens to be stuck in the middle of Purge Night, and of course you can't forget the poor Family whose house gets raided. It's cheesy and predictable. I give it a 2/10 because the concept is wonderful. It looks good on paper but shouldn't be made. Step up the acting and step down the over the top plot twist and conspicuous jump scare scenes.",The Purge - Anarchy
324,Briancarey35,"Great movie, not better then first.",9,22 July 2014,"This movie was excellent, but my main purpose in this review is to say that it was not better then the first, it's the flip side to the purge, you can't really compare the two, there showing you two different sides, of course the first movie wasn't as actiony as this one, they weren't purging! It's like the first episode in a season, it's not going to be a darn Armageddon, it's a foundation to the series to come. So anyone saying that it's better then the first isn't quite correct, and the first movie shouldn't be getting knocked so much just because the second one had you on the edge more, the movies are part of the same series, but very much different. This movie was excellent as was the first one.",The Purge - Anarchy
325,jmatiasw,critic,1,27 July 2014,How to start? Worst movie ever!! Plot worst introduced ever !! Maybe if the director saturated colors or put futuristic devices in order to make the movie look like some weird alternative future (?) And thus avoid explaining the crazy near future...something! No sense why everything happened! If you know how to sell me a stupid plot..then it becomes a good plot... This all has no sense at all! People just shooting people! Watch a western and period! And the way rich people are introduced...come on! There's tones of examples in movie history in how to make them look like crazy-evil beings! just some lines in the dialog and we will buy it! Please don't fall on this one like myself! I regret wasting 2 hours of my precious life!,The Purge - Anarchy
326,theeldin,Overall the most epic movie out there,9,29 July 2014,"I walked into this movie expecting what all my wrestling high school teammates told me; that this movie was not scary and it was garbage. I'll tell you one thing, those kids must have nerves of steel. What I got instead is a new smash hit. I wouldn't be surprised if this mad dog was selling like hot cakes. This movie had me shivering before it even started. The characters are just complete wild cards, you can never expect what they're gonna do next. I remember in one of the Clown Crew Scenes I literally stood up and screamed in the theater. Luckily, nobody else noticed me because everyone else also screamed. This movie is a complete smash hit, having some of the most popular actors in the history of history. The movie is completely original. The Purge One was also amazing but this one just brought an entire new concept; Shooting. In this movie, shooting was more deadly than ever before. I remember in one of the scenes, the main character gives us a lesson on guns and shooting in general. It taught me everything I need to know for the purge that I'm having at my house. The people I went with also loved it, saying how they believe it's gonna be the new smash hit of 2014. Great film in general, I believe it will get an Oscar. Absolutely fantastic.I had to nick one point off, however, because the clowns were driving motorcycles; however, as we all know ,clowns only drive small cars. I think the director either got lazy or was just trying to disgrace Clown Culture, but either way it deserved a point taken off.",The Purge - Anarchy
327,gebhart-dj,The Purge is an annual 12-hour event where crime will go unpunished.,3,7 August 2014,"The movie was good but clearly had a political agenda. Our real founding fathers were heroes that saved us from a tyrannical government so the name of the current government who started the Purge in this movie, ""The New Founding Fathers"" was a bit offensive. Anti-gun,anti-wealthy, etc. It appears to blame rich people for developing the Purge to get rid of poor people. I'm not rich but instead of vilifying the rich, can't we aspire to them? There may be some bad rich people,but I don't think they all evil haters of poor like this movie represents. Just remember, Hollywood stars may not have guns but their bodyguards do.",The Purge - Anarchy
328,lizzieandjose,Review,8,5 August 2014,"I was nicely surprised. It was quite a good movie, definitely not horror though. I found the masks scarier than the movie, and the masks weren't all that scary either. I like that it actually showed what was going on during the purge from different people's perspectives. It could have been better. It seemed to go from one intense thing to another once the purging started taking place. There weren't really parts of the movie where you take a minute and let it all sink in. I did want all but one main character in the movie to die though because they were irritating. It had some funny parts to it and I guess somewhat sad parts. Good overall. I'd like to see them make a movie about the purgers though now that we saw it from the perspective of people who were victims of the purge. I think would be way more interesting.",The Purge - Anarchy
329,roncass-73-777140,Bit of fun but life ain't all about fun.,5,7 August 2014,"This is an entertaining film, some decent performances from the leading actresses, an interesting overall concept yet its shallow, politically driven, unbelievable and lacking a standout performance. Perfect for teenagers who want mindless violence, a film lacking depth with no real great storyline cast around the characters.The Purge occurs once a year, where people are allowed break the law for one night as a way of cleansing America, saving the government money and allowing people the opportunity to settle scores through violence. A morale dilemma occurs for the more liberal, saner, good natured cast, scared cast of characters who just so happens to be the ones caught up in the thick of all the action against their best efforts at hiding away like the majority of people do for this night. I'm unique in that atmospherics can make and break a film for me and their are some nice city scenes, lights and interesting looking characters this is mainly where most of points are afforded otherwise my rating would be way lower. Add a stand out performance, a stand out script, more interesting characters and you would be closer to getting the little bit of tension and intrigue that the overall concept should facilitate.",The Purge - Anarchy
330,glanvillejosh99,could of been great. but falls into the same bland category of horror films.,6,15 August 2014,"i walked into the Purge: Anarchy. with a mixed feeling. I was optimistic about the film after seeing the great trailer and thoughts on how great this idea was that there was no law for 12 hours. and if this premise was used correctly how i could be watching one of the best horror films in many a year, which in my eyes could save the genre. however i was also a bit worried that because of the lack luster performance of the first film i would once again be disappointed. and i was disappointed. the ending was predictable. and the characters were basic. it was as if the director knew he had a good thing but wasn't confident enough to go all the way with it. so he played it safe with some boring cliché's and predictable plot points. to give it some credit i liked the perspective changes and it gave me thoughts on my way home how crazy a night like purge night will be.also the film built up different plot points that if developed could be entertaining and bring me into the movie more. But then dropped them for something else. it had too many ideas on where it wanted to go and in the end just came out with bland movie. it could of easily been a PG 13 if they just took out some blood splatter and the F word. it tries to make you care about characters you don't care about. could of been great. but failed like it's predecessor. but will do well enough for the producers to create a series.",The Purge - Anarchy
331,mieloka1390,loved it,10,5 September 2014,"Better than the first purge. It had non stop action, great twists, definitely best on the big screen!! I saw it twice in theaters! Great great great movie!! The characters did well together as far as chemistry. The ending was good and realistic to the situation. I love these movies and can't get enough of them! Has become one of my favorites by far! My boyfriend also loved the movie, as well as my mother. I will buy this movie when it comes to direct TV and DVD. It's a fantastic watch, especially if you like non stop action and suspense/ suspense thrillers. The worst part was when that girls husband got killed. I was disappointed that was in there because they were reconciling their relationship.",The Purge - Anarchy
332,ssendoog1,Whut?,4,24 September 2014,"First and foremost, the concept of the film is good - interesting although somewhat unrealistic and illogical. However, as the story unravels, the connection of the characters simply does not make sense. The main character played by Frank Grillo, who was on his way to seek revenge on the 12 hour Purge Night, rescued four helpless civilians from the street. Despite that they were loud and annoying, he decided to escort them to a safer place in exchange of a car. Somehow in the process of running around and shooting crazy people, he felt that one of the civilians - a young girl that kept asking questions, was ""special"". The connection was weak, but he felt obligated to protect her no matter what. Anyway, after many plot holes along the way, he finally got to the place he wanted to go 11 hours and 55 minutes ago. He had 5 minutes to seek revenge but suddenly his conscience comes into play. He decided to not kill someone so recklessly (although he has had his fair share of fun, shooting like a gangsta). Like whut?The end.",The Purge - Anarchy
333,savethebadgers,Its my right to purge....,7,25 July 2015,"Firstly I enjoyed the first film even though it was a very basic story line. This is no different just with a few layers of basic story telling that converge because of some amazingly lucky corner turning. Don't get me wrong I love films like The Warriors, Escape from New York etc etc...I am not watching them to be intellectually challenged. However I really enjoy the darker (darker than 12 hrs of slaughtering each other) side of the plot it appeals to the conspiracy theorist in me. When these Battle royal style films come out one of my favorite things is the variation in weapons and creative kills (Zombieland) that doesn't happen so much in this as style kills give way to efficient methods.If you want a good fun film grab some munchies and enjoy this doom-pornfest. It will be a while before I watch it again but will tell friends about it. If you want to watch the future going to hell I would suggest Hobo with a shotgun.",The Purge - Anarchy
334,bernhart,Better than the First Purge,9,20 July 2014,"How many times can you say that a ""sequel"" is better than the original? Exactly. The acting was better in this movie and the plot(s) were MUCH better. The violence level was limited (wisely) by the director. In fact there is no real ""gore"" in this movie or scenes that obviously don't make the movie any better. Somehow, some way the director exercised restraint, a rarity these days. Reminded me more of the old Escape from LA/New York flicks for some reason. As far as the social undertones of the movie, remember it is just a movie, meant to entertain and shock the senses. Don't go getting all political with it and trying to tie today's war against the poor to this movie. That would be silly. It is an action movie.",The Purge - Anarchy
