0,SnoopyStyle,Avary tries too hard,5,29 November 2015,"At a party in Camden College, New Hampshire, Lauren Hynde (Shannyn Sossamon) pines for her cheating ex-boyfriend Victor Johnson (Kip Pardue) as she gets raped losing her virginity while a film student is recording it. Paul Denton (Ian Somerhalder) tries to make out with a jock and gets beaten up. Sean Bateman (James van der Beek) is bruised. He misses Lauren and instead has sex with a drunken Kelly (Kate Bosworth). The movie goes back months to see how these characters arrive to their state. Sean is the younger brother of Patrick Bateman from another Bret Easton Ellis novel 'American Psycho'. He deals drugs and owes money to unstable dealer Rupert Guest (Clifton Collins, Jr.). Lauren's roommate is slutty Lara Holleran (Jessica Biel). This is an unrequited love triangle between Lauren, Paul and Sean with plenty of misunderstandings.The movie is trying too hard with its edgy cinematic style. Director Roger Avary throws unnecessary camera tricks at the audience. He should let the outlandish depraved antics speak for themselves. Avary is also the screenwriter but he fails to add any humor. It's a lot of shock and awe. Ian Somerhalder is uncomfortably good. The young cast is not necessarily full of great actors but they fit into this crazy world very well. I found it a little boring as the movie tries too hard to be shocking. For example, Paul masturbates with a passed out Sean in the room is a complete scene by itself. Avary has to do an imagined split-screen scene of them making out. It's unnecessary and distracting from the really interesting scene.",The Rules of Attraction
1,gavin6942,A Film I Have a Love-Hate Relationship With,7,4 April 2006,"A few years ago I caught ""Rules of Attraction"" at a friend's house. I was mesmerized by the images I saw and repulsed by other images. But most of all, I was fascinated with my reaction more than the film itself.I purchased the DVD recently and watched it again. And a similar response: I don't know if I love it or hate it, but I do know I really want to watch the film again. Which, I guess, is a compliment.The story is that of Sean, Paul and Lauren (as well as many other minor characters) who attend Camden University, and have a very twisted love triangle amongst themselves and simultaneously involving other people. The overall theme is you can never really know anyone and the one you love is not necessarily the one who loves you. Oh, and Sean is the brother of Patrick Bateman from ""American Psycho"". Although this doesn't matter much.Some things about the film are annoying. Mainly, the director's obsession with showing things in reverse. There's a point to it, and I respect the way he uses this gimmick to have different stories overlap, but the reverse filming is overdone and becomes little more than a waste of time. I also greatly dislike the end. I won't reveal what it is, but I will say it leaves you feeling like you bought a toy with the batteries missing.Besides this, the film has three main things that I think are appealing. One: The characters of the drug dealer and ""Dick"" are both great and provide necessary comic relief. Two: The music is used in such a way that you may never hear the songs the same way again (George Michael's ""Faith"", Starland Vocal Band's ""Afternoon Delight"" and whoever sings ""All By Myself""). Three: using the stars of Dawson's Creek and 7th Heaven (basically clean shows) to show intense drug use, suicide, gay sex, masturbation, gang bangs and profane language. This third thing is probably the biggest appeal.Also, Boone from ""Lost"" stars... before being in ""Lost"". Although in this film he's gay and in Lost he's a sniveling boot-licker. So I guess he's been typecast as a feminine character and not really much different in these roles.I guess I recommend this film, even though my gut reaction is to not recommend it to anyone. At least I can say this: Sean Bateman is much less annoying in this movie than he is in the novel ""American Psycho"". Rock and roll.",The Rules of Attraction
2,Quinoa1984,a strangely off-putting college movie,5,13 October 2002,"The Rules of Attraction seems to have the demented edge and wit of a Bret Easton Ellis novel and the styling of someone like Avary, a graduate with honors from the Tarantino school of screen-writing, but as an director he doesn't bring anything from himself into the writing (like he might have in Pulp), and what the film is left with is the lines most likely taken right from the novel that would be better read than heard- in particular since these characters don't seem to have any lives of interest whatsoever outside of doing drugs and having sex- and the slight affects of what could look like a satire on the part of Avary is squandered on ideologies that make the cast of MTV Undressed look like scholars.  And I like sex and drugs in movies, yet every milli-second is crossing the bounds.Yet, Rules of Attraction becomes one of those movies that's too distant and f***ed up to be easily enjoyed, and too well crafted to be easily dismissed- Avary does try and put a lot of work into the editing and camera work and I was impressed some of the time when it started, until I realized that this was going to be his style throughout practically every scene (fast forwarding, rewinding, cutting back and forth between random acts).  I don't mind such techniques, but when overdone such as this it becomes unsatisfying.  And as for the acting, many of the performances turned in, considering the dialogue, is impressive- James Van Der Beek plays Sean Bateman, obviously a relative (possible sibling) of Patrick from Ellis' American Psycho (a film FAR better than this one), who is a drug dealer; Shannyn Sossamon plays Lauren, a girl who's only mistake is dating someone going to another college, er, Europe (that scene, for instance, where Justin is shown in fast motion in Europe is like a longer, unfocused rip off of something Kubrick did perfectly in Clockwork Orange); and Ian Somerhalder plays Paul, a very bi-man who wants Sean despite that he is not gay and is trying to get Lauren.  By the end, I knew I had never seen such a stark, bleak showing of college life, and also that I wouldn't want to again anytime soon.  Still, stone-cold Ellis and Avary fans might find some use here.  Grade: C+",The Rules of Attraction
3,wes-connors,It's the End of the World as We Know It (and I Feel Fine),4,1 January 2009,"Self-centered college students party and have sex. The focus is a ""love triangle"" formed by: frustrated abstinent Shannyn Sossamon (Lauren Hynde), promiscuous dealer James Van Der Beek (Sean Bateman), and shallow homosexual Ian Somerhalder (Paul Denton). All three are, actually, a combination of frustrated, promiscuous, and shallow - as are many other characters in the cast. Accent on shallow. Writer/director Roger Avary takes his cues from Bret Easton Ellis's novel ""The Rules of Attraction"". Several characters from ""Rules"" have appeared in Mr. Avary's other books; most notably, ""Sean"" is the younger brother of ""Patrick Bateman"". Faye Dunaway, Swoosie Kurtz, Fred Savage, Eric Stoltz, and Paul Williams appear briefly (one in briefs). The film has an ""experimental"" look, beginning with ""backwards"" motion. A split screen meeting between Mr. Van Der Beek and Ms. Sossamon is cute. But, the best part of the entire work is a short segment you could call ""Victor's European Semester"". With dizzying detail, the character Kip Pardue (as Victor) narrates the sex-and-drugs details of his European trip. This small part of the film is amazing; and, it's really all you need, to get the point. Due to this excellent montage, the story is lifted, momentarily, peaking with a hilarious reunion for ""Lauren and ""Victor"". **** The Rules of Attraction (2002) Roger Avary ~ James Van Der Beek, Shannyn Sossamon, Ian Somerhalder",The Rules of Attraction
4,preppy-3,When will Hollywood learn?,2,15 October 2002,"Bret Easton Ellis books don't make good movies. The books are fantastic...the movies are horrible. Remember ""Less Than Zero""? ""American Psycho""? Both bombs. This will probably follow.Adventures of three students in Cadmen College,NH. There's amoral Sean Bateman (James Van Der Beek), bisexual (mostly homosexual) Paul (Ian Somerhalder) and virgin Lauren (Shannyn Sossamon). Sean lusts after Lauren--Paul lusts after Sean--Lauren lusts after somebody else. Sex, suicide and drug abuse ensure.Writer/director Scott Avary took a difficult book to film and did everything wrong. For instance, Sean and Paul sleep together a few times in the book, not in the movie--it's sad to see homophobia is still alive and well. Lauren was not a virgin in the book and Sean is 20 times worse too. Basically they change things around badly--Paul's not sleeping with Sean dilutes their relationship; Lauren is made a virgin so her first sexual encounter is disgusting (the guy throws up on her--yes, it's shown); Sean is made nicer so he won't totally alienate the audience. This ends up diluting the story and characters considerably. Also, the book came out in 1987--back then drug abuse among college students was shocking--not anymore! What we're left with is a lot of unpleasant or pathetic characters and vile situations. Depressing, bleak and annoying.The acting helps a little. Van Der Beek is just OK as Bateman. He basically glowers all the time--unfortunately when he's tries to show homicidal tendencies he's hysterically bad. Sossamon is good as Lauren--interesting and well-acted. Best of all is Somerhalder--he's handsome, hunky and very affecting as Paul. He also is involved in the best sequence in the film--him and his cousin Richard (Dick) are meeting their mothers (played by Swoosie Kurtz and Faye Dunaway!!!!) for dinner. Richard is also gay, gets dead roaring drunk and what follows is a hysterical sequence in a bedroom and at a dining room. Those 10-15 minutes are truly fantastic. That aside, there's no reason to see this. Read the book instead.",The Rules of Attraction
5,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Sometimes I can't believe the crap that spills out of my mouth,7,3 April 2012,"Based on the Bret Easton Ellis novel of the same title(that I have not read and cannot compare it to, albeit I understand that it goes far in portraying the same disillusioned, borderline psychopathic types), this chronicles the passing of Spring to Winter in the lives of three Camden college students; drug dealer Sean(younger brother of Patrick Bateman, from American Psycho; played by Van Der Beek, who I didn't expect to do well, but he surprised me), virgin Lauren(Sossamon) and bisexual Paul(Somerhalder), who barely knew each other, and are suddenly in a love triangle with each other(there's a lot of unrequited love in this, and they don't notice that only they are into the relationship, and/or they don't take care of it). They and their peers(in fact, everyone in this) have trouble connecting(or communicating... they talk without saying anything) with anyone else(one point has a snowflake melt on someone's temple, in place of them shedding a tear), and do plenty of drugs and drinking to get by. With this being a very provocative picture, it places some of the very most disgusting material right at the beginning. If you don't last until the opening credits sequence, this is not for you. And don't feel bad, it's a very explicit piece. This very much follows the logic that you don't need appealing characters, that you can center the focus on interesting, yet horrible, human beings. I gotta say, it works. There is no one likable in this, yet it didn't bore me. They are shallow, spoilt(and since you meet a few of the parents, you understand why), arrogant and care for little other than satisfying their own urges(which they project onto their preferred partner). This needing to differentiate between the three perspectives and the fairly different(all messed up, yes... not in the same exact way, however) people led to them using nicely done visual things(the storytelling is superb), such as splitscreen and ""rewinding the film"", in order to set the stage(in time and location) for what happened to one of the others, simultaneously with what we've just seen. It also starts at the conclusion, after which, it is in chronological order(noting aforementioned skips backwards). This is one of the few honest movies about going to a university(one might call it a satire on that, and a savage beating of the ""teenage romp""), all the unhappy couples, desires running rampant, how little the students care about class(in fact, we never see them in that setting, though we see them at plenty of parties) etc. It's raw. The acting is great, for everyone involved. Writing and development are very well-done, you really get a sense of this environment and the men and women there. This is the only film directed by Avary I've seen, and one of the only ones he's done. You can understand why he and Tarantino get along; they share an appreciation of the despicable. This is marvelously paced, it never stands still without going by too fast. There is a lot of fairly graphic sexual content, full male and female nudity, strong language and disturbing, violent, bloody content(including suicide attempts) in this. The DVD comes with informational extras. They are the six commentaries: #1(Sharon Seymour, Ron Jeremy, Ian Somerhalder & Russell Sams), #2(Shannyn Sossamon, Theresa Wayman, Kip Pardue & Clifton Collins Jr.), 3# Jeremiah Samuels, Andy Milburn, Thomas Ian Nichols & Joel Michaely), 4#(Robert Brinkmann & Harry Ralston), #5(Carrot Top)(it's... his typical shtick, maybe? Immature, yet adult in tone, comedy, some of it genuinely funny, and he may very well be recording it as he watches this for the first time; his doesn't tell you much about the production, if it is amusing) & #6(Sharon Rutter & Eric Szmanda), a 26 and a half minute anatomy of a scene featurette, 13 minutes of ""soundbites""(interviews) and the original script in .pdf format(no, I'm not reading it all, besides, I know perfectly well that I don't have the chops to critique it). It also comes with a theatrical trailer for this, The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys, Hollywood Ending and Jet Lag, a teaser and a TV spot. I recommend this to anyone who wants a credible depiction of this sort of situation. 7/10",The Rules of Attraction
6,FlashCallahan,Drank Absinthe in a bar called Absinthe.....,8,19 July 2014,"Three disturbed students at Camden college get involved in a love triangle. Sean Bateman is a womanising drug dealer who falls in love with virginal Lauren because he suspects that she is his secret admirer, who is leaving notes in his box. Although Lauren does like Sean, she is still infatuated with Victor who is travelling around Europe for a semester. Lauren used to date Paul before he came out of the closet, and now Paul has his eyes on Sean when he mistakes him for bisexual. Everybody is only looking out for themselves, and are all paranoid of one another.....It's another marmite of cinema,you either love this film, or detest it with intensity. I for one, love this movie, because of its audacity, its daring, and its wonderful camera work, and use of narrative.Its in the same world as Ellis' American Psycho, as Sean is related to Patrick Bateman from that movie, and it's as leftfield as that wonderful movie.To say the movie is complicated, is an understatement. All characters in the film are important, and when you see the film for a second or third time, you will notice subtle things, like Seans admirer popping up in scenes that you hadn't noticed before.The use of reverse filming is a wonderful inclusion to the narrative, and there is one scene where Lauren and Sean are walking to a class, and the split screen melds into one frame in a wonderfully sublime way.But the best thing in this film is the travel log of Victor. Its trippy, psychedelic, energetic, and has a wonderful piece of music to accompany it.Its a shame it didn't have more recognition than it received on release, because this is worthy of cult doom alongside anything Tarantino has done.It's the antichrist of college movies, and it wears it proudly on its sleeve.....",The Rules of Attraction
7,christopher-underwood,still too proudly loutish to make it much fun,7,12 January 2007,"Uncompromising, uncut and unpleasant. I never quite got over the opening sequence where the lead decides to loose her virginity with a geeky movie buff and then we realize a third person is on the scene taking her from behind whilst the nerd films it. As he does so the drunken 'performer' vomits profusely over the bent forward 'starlet'. Yes, a college kid movie where everyone is even worse than ever before. The tone was not right for me (and there was too much homosexual activity) and the music not mine either. For a younger generation this might work like a Tarantino but it made me feel old. Even the celebrated scene with the two mothers come to meet their sons and proceeding to get drunk failed to lift this depressing little film. The speeded up 'European vacation' sequence was effective but still too proudly loutish to make it much fun. Maybe another look another time when I'm younger.",The Rules of Attraction
8,=G=,"Hey, boys and girls, pull my finger.",4,18 February 2003,"""Rules of Attraction"" is either a darkly satirical comedic slam of campus social life or a load of crap. Seemingly obsessed with biological functions, Avary takes us through a boring nonstory about some ridiculous coed caricatures and booze and drugs and sex and masturbation and defecation and regurgitation..etc. Given no tangible storyline, much time consuming filler, and nothing original or creative, this droning kaleidoscope of nonsense is, well, a load of crap destined for the ""pull my finger"" youth mentality. To be a darkly satirical comedic slam of campus social life would require some skill and adroit autuersmanship. Oh, yeah, and a story. (D+)Note - Two axioms of filmdom apply here. (a) If you have to explain a movie, it's probably not a very good movie - and - (b) The director gets both the credit and the ""heat"".",The Rules of Attraction
9,bowmanblue,Don't believe the (anti) hype,9,3 October 2016,"When I first watched 'Rules of Attraction' I was completely blown away. So much so that I started reading up on the film and its reviews in general after I'd seen it. It was only then that I realised how – pretty much – universally hated it was! If you haven't heard of it, you probably have heard of 'American Psycho.' It's an infamous novel (and also later film) written by Brett Easten Ellis about a serial killer in eighties New York by the name of Patrick Bateman. 'Rules of Attraction' is also penned by the same dark and brooding author, but this time focuses in on the titular American Psycho's younger brother, Sean Bateman and his experiences at college.If you're expecting something quite so bloodthirsty as American Psycho then you're certainly going to be disappointed, but, then again, if you're hoping for something quite light and fluffy, then you're also looking in the wrong place. Perhaps one of the reasons 'RoA' was not well received was because the film was released among a spate of cheeky/raunchy teen comedies such as 'American Pie' where a group a lovable teens gets up to hilarious (adult) antics.That could be – sort of – used to describe RoA, but this time the word 'lovable' would not be found here. There are three main characters (Sean being only one) and, just because they're not dissecting prostitutes like Sean's older brother, doesn't make them nice. Therefore, if you're hoping to relate to any of the central protagonists then you probably won't. The three of them – despite being pretty unlikable – are all locked in various love triangles and can't seem to shake them. We're treated to the different ways they deal with this, none of which I would actually recommend in real life when dealing with the object of your attraction! Yes, it is pretty dark and you need to know what you're in for before you watch it. It doesn't really pull too many punches and, although you may laugh sometimes, it won't be the same 'happy laughter' that probably came out of your belly when you were watching Jason Biggs with a pie. Here it's black comedy all the way, but if that's what you're in the mood for then don't believe the nay-sayers and give this one a go.Special nod to the excellent soundtrack!",The Rules of Attraction
10,inkblot11,"Stay away, stay away, for goodness sake, stay away from this film!",1,6 December 2006,"This will be the shortest review ever, but I'm sorry I watched even a few minutes of this totally repulsive film. I THOUGHT there might be a love story involved, which is why I purchased the film for $1.00. What wasted money! This is a sex-driven, drug-driven, filth-driven piece of work that should have received an NC-17 or X rating. Do NOT let anyone under 18 watch it and destroy any copies you come in contact with. This is one very deplorable film, no matter what its clever qualities. No decent person should let themselves be exposed to this awful excuse for a movie. Amen. The plot involves college students with different agendas, all of them pretty pathetic and unsavory. Supposedly, the students are attending a first rate college but not one of them seems to have one ounce of sense. Stay away, please. There I've said it again and I mean it.",The Rules of Attraction
11,callanvass,Overrated independent feature.,5,14 June 2011,"Camden College. Sean Bateman is the younger brother of depraved Wall Street broker Patrick Bateman. He's also a drug dealer who owes a lot of money to ""fellow"" dealer Rupert Guest, as well as a well-known womanizer, for he sleeps with nearly half of the female population on campus. Lauren Hynde is, technically, a virgin. She's saving herself for her shallow boyfriend, Victor Johnson, who's left the States to backpack across Europe. Her slutty roommate, Lara, has the hots for Victor as well. Paul Denton, who used to date Lauren, is openly bisexual and attracted to Mitchell Allen, who's dating Candice to prove to Paul that he's not gay. Sean loves Lauren. Paul loves Sean. And Lauren may love Sean.I couldn't get into the style of the movie. For starters I felt nothing for the characters, nor did I really get the motivation for the idea behind this movie. It's unpleasant with unlikable characters, and a slow pace.Bottom line. Film buffs may wanna take a crack on it, but casual movie goers will probably ought to stay away. I'm a film buff and I disliked it. 5/10",The Rules of Attraction
12,johnnyboyz,Un-attractive but not entirely ugly.,6,5 October 2006,"Following the success of 'American Psycho', (Well, a success in my eyes) another novel by controversial author Bret Easton Ellis is given the silver screen treatment. This time, with the co-writer of 1994's critically acclaimed film 'Pulp Fiction' as the director, surely there're enough ingredients to make this adaptation an even better one. You'd think so, but unfortunately, it doesn't work as well this time round.Following an impressive opening of voice-overs feeding off an amusing script, with each character being singled out as the one's we're meant to root for through the excess of the voice-overs and some interesting use of slow motion footage played in reverse to show what other people are doing simultaneously, 'The Rules of Attraction' starts its very steady and very sophisticated fall into nothingness.Despite the slightly uncanny resemblances to 'Donnie Darko' during this opening, 'The Rules of Attraction' falls away into an orgy of very basic and very primitive scenes and content that has only really been seen exploited in brainless, American teen films of the past ten years. I got the feeling this film really didn't want to be labelled one of those but yes; it's American and yes, it's 'teen' and yes, I'm afraid it's brainless. In fact it was close to being some kind of dark prequel to 'American Pie'.What this film does is hover around its principal for far too long. We realise this film is taking a multi-strand path and with Pulp Fiction's second in command in the chair, we think it's going to be exploited rather well. To be truthful, there is no real core to this film; it's just entwining student's stories and even then, they're exploited in a rather distasteful and, to be honest, 'boring' manner. I mean; 'how many cigarettes do we have to see each character light up?' 'How many scenes have to be set at parties and how many do there have to be?' 'How many times do we have to see young couples going around pretending they're in love with each other?' According to this film: a heck load. This is the problem. There's no stability in the film. It uses the same content over and over again to try to create so many different things: Love, drama, tragedy, romance but ultimately, these things are never really in the picture and you never get a sense they will ever be with the rather bland, bored expressions the characters have on their faces.The comparisons with American Psycho are always going to crop up, mainly due to the fact Patrick Bateman's brother stars in this film. He tries to take on a similar persona but in the end, you get no real feeling that they're related at all. All that Van der Beek (Bateman) does is pull a couple of funny faces, uses an alias once or twice and just gets into general mischief due to his drug selling business. In American Psycho, his brother Patrick does his killings through hate and jealousy and what made it even more powerful was the fact he was the only one that did it as everyone else could contain themselves. Here, everybody gets all uptight over each other. Love is the problem and when love is the issue in the film, the term 'rom-com' springs to mind.With no likable characters at all and only one or two funny scenes that stand out, those being the dinner table scene involving a drunk gay character in front of his mother and his mother's friend with the other being the riotous montage we are shown of one character's Eurotrip (Which was probably all made up due to the amount of women he said he pulled), 'The Rules of Attraction' doesn't hold up during the space of its runtime and doesn't seem to even end correctly.",The Rules of Attraction
13,Polaris_DiB,Self-aggrandizing schlock,3,19 March 2007,"This movie starts out well enough. It introduces us to three characters that seem to be interesting, and shows their actions during a party that plays forward and back through their different perspectives. It promises not only an engaging story of their interconnection, but a satirical commentary on the college world and contemporary ""disaffected youth."" It even has strong imagery and a lot of reference to cinema past to show that the director knows what he's doing.And then it turns out to be a movie about hateful people doing hateful things, until they either die hatefully or end up alone hatefully. But instead of being like a John Cassavetes work or like production, where the discomfort and hatefulness is intended, we're actually supposed to relate to these characters. Woops.After the first scene ends and we start to figure out these characters we've been introduced to, this movie runs like that bad date with the pretty person who happens to have a really bad personality you accidentally ask out before knowing. All initial impressions degrade as we find out that nothing in this movie is really worth the time knowing about in the first place, but unfortunately we seem to be stuck with it for two hours. At least I was stuck with it. I make a point of never turning anything off before finishing it. I did have to take at least three breaks just to get through it, though.I have to make one major concession: Roger Avary not only does his job well, he shows a particularly strong knowledge of visual structure and grammar, strong enough indeed to adapt a Bret Easton Ellis novel. His mistake was to adapt a Bret Easton Ellis novel.I don't know what it is about this contemporary author's work, but his particular blend of obnoxious not-actually-relatable characters as social commentary and satire seems to appeal to a lot of people. I don't know why. And Avary himself seems pretty pleased with the mix, filling his work with homages and references to show that yes, he does know what he's doing, and yes, he likes being smart about it. Why does the drug dealer kid pick up the copy of 100 Years of Solitude? No reason, it's just smart. Why is The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari playing in the background? It's art. Why are there quotes by Nietzsche speckled around the sets? C'mon, we're here to say something in between our make-fun-of-but-actually-reinforce-middle-class-college style narrative. Does it matter that our characters are two dimensional constructs? No! They talk fast and prettily, like a Quentin Tarantino script! Does it matter that they actually do those things we know are so stupid to do? No, it's fate! Ultimately this film is nothing more than self-aggrandizing attempts to demystify something that's not mythic in the first place, and like all attempts like that, it actually reinforces the things it hates rather than subverts them.If you want subversive cinema, go somewhere else.--PolarisDiB",The Rules of Attraction
14,runamokprods,Underrated playfully bleak film,7,24 July 2011,"A true guilty pleasure, I was surprised I liked this as much as I did. Roger Avery approaches it with a funny, light, high energy touch, not asking us to take Brett Easton Ellis's nihilism too seriously. Consequently, a film where every character is deeply flawed and narcissistic is never boring, and often full of a visceral energy. It even has occasional moments where it becomes moving. And many of the showy style tricks work with the excesses of the story. Yes, it's film studenty at times, and chunks are too familiar and on the nose (Faye Dunaway and Swoozie Kurtz as boozy moms who choose not to see how screwed up their kids are, the extra shallow treatment of the gay character. etc). I can't really argue this is a great film, but I can't deny I enjoyed watching it, was never bored, and was even made to think. Fun soundtrack and a good Tomandandy score too.",The Rules of Attraction
15,MBunge,"If you don't like the first 30 seconds, you won't like the rest of the film. It also probably means you're a mentally and emotionally healthy person.",4,11 October 2010,"The Rules of Attraction is definitely one book you can judge by its cover. It's starts off with a scene where young college student Lauren (Shannyn Sossamon) wakes from a drunken stupor to find herself being raped by a stranger while the guy she thought she was going to have drunken sex with films it with his little video camera. Lauren, however, is so consumed with shame and unhappiness she doesn't even mind the sexual assaultand then her rapist pukes on her. That scene very much captures the essence of The Rules of Attraction so if you can stomach that, you might be the sort of person to enjoy this mean, little, cynical, spoiled piece of American cinema.Adapted from the novel by Brett Easton Ellis, writer of American Psycho, the story focuses on three college students. There's Lauren, a pseudo-romantic virgin who can only be considered smart and responsible in comparison to the other stupid, amoral douchebags in the film. There's Paul (Ian Somerhalder), an unhappy homosexual who is emotionally disconnected from everyone except the third main character, Sean James Van Der Beek). He happens to be a stunningly shallow, angry kid from modest means who pretends to be as rich as his fellow classmates and deals drugs on campus. They inhabit a world where getting drunk, getting high and getting laid are literally the only things anyone cares about and genuine emotions are alien objects no one knows what to do with.Lauren and Paul are the least repellent characters in the film, but that's largely because Sean and everyone else are profoundly unpleasant people you don't care about and wouldn't want to be around. The recurring theme of the film is the pain of being in love with someone who doesn't care about you, but since all of these characters are so unlikable that you wouldn't be bothered if they were slowly eaten alive by badgers, nothing that goes on in the movie can really matter. Now, horrible people can still be compelling characters, but it usually requires them being put in a context where you can hate or feel sorry for them. In The Rules of Attraction, these terrible people are just more scenery in an icy, nihilistic world where nothing good lasts more than a few moments before turning into crap.This is basically a one-note story and tries to disguise it with some fancy camera work. The best example is a scene where Lauren and Sean meet and we're supposed to feel a spark between them. It's shot split screen style, so that as Lauren and Sean are looking at each other they're actually looking out at the audience. The problem is that if you take away the camera trick, nothing the characters do or say in the scene is at all interesting.Aside from commending the director and cinematographer for almost completely succeeding in drawing our attention away from James Van Der Beek's Giant Forehead O' Doom throughout the film and noting that Clifton Collins Jr. gives a good performance as a crazed drug dealer, I'm not sure there's much else positive I can say for The Rules of Attraction. It seems like it thinks it's one of those ""you had to be there"" films, where the things on the screen are supposed to connect with things in your real life. But if your college experience was anything like this movie, I feel sorry for you.",The Rules of Attraction
16,Chris_Docker,"Hardly mainstream, but worth more than a cursory glance",7,10 April 2003,"Marketed as American Pie meets Pulp Fiction, Rules of Attraction may be ultimately and unsettlingly less comic-strip than either of the films it purports to be a blend of - or alternatively you may just find it empty, lacking in laughs, and meaningless.Rules of Attraction can, however, be seen as more than the simple gross-out comedy it starts off as. Misrepresenting itself as inane, it lulls the viewer into a false sense of superficiality, an apparent nonchalance. But the veils are lifted from the slapstick campus hedonism, firstly by revealing a deeper characterisation than the opening burlesque would suggest, and secondly by contrasting the apparently buoyant atmosphere with a stark nihilism forcefully rendered by unfolding events.Rules of Attraction follows the student drink, drugs, sex and unrequited love themes of many formulaic movies. It might almost be written off as little more than a fart-and-w**k movie were it not for the early stylish cinematography and crisp dialogue, which maybe hint that it is more a send up of them than a clone. Engaging roll-backs take us from a straightforward bad taste pastiche - drunken students have sex while another films the action, the first male repeatedly and almost absent-mindedly vomiting over the woman he is shafting. We follow the camera in reverse (including the vomit going back into his mouth) and the two dimensional characters gradually take on more depth. Initially we laughed and felt revolted by the antics of such cardboard cut-outs but then the genre shifts gear imperceptibly and we have to take them more seriously. The grossness may have temporarily blinded us, for instance, to the fact that the vomit-spattered student was actually being raped, but the vaguely persisting air of unreality robs us of any moral outrage. It is the emotional bleakness of the film that hits hardest. Things are not what they seem, even to the characters of the story. Any belief in 'love' is cruelly and repeatedly banished by the harsh reality each of the students faces. The cynicism runs almost like a homoerotic commentary on the pointlessness of heterosexual attraction - except that gays are equally subject here to blind conviction in matters of love and lust. Even suicide is degraded - not the grand statement of the unrequited lover, but a minor incident in an irrelevant series of obsessive misunderstandings.What are the 'Rules'? On one level, the film might be saying, ""there are no rules""; on another, more pessimistic level, it has rules like ""if you truly are attracted to / love someone, they will feel more attracted to someone else""; ""if you happen to love someone who also loves you, then one or both of you will screw things up"". This is not a film where people screw things up and then get over it, get forgiven, and live happily ever after. Instead, it says when you screw up, you become less of a person - you, or the object of your affection, are suddenly exposed as far less than ideal. You cease to be worthy of any sort of love. The glorified image becomes not only human, but normal, ordinary and pathetic. As the recently unenamoured Lauren says towards the end of the film, ""It doesn't matter, there's lots of people like him"" and then in a moment of self-reflection adds pointedly , ""lots of people like us"". Love has been acknowledged as mere mirage, both for the object of love and for our own self image.At the screening I went to, hardly anyone left before the end of the credits. Perhaps this was an interest in the cast, the unusual way the credits rolled backwards, or even a sense of release from constant shock; or maybe it was a natural pause to try to believe again in dreams the film had worked so hard and so convincingly to dispel.",The Rules of Attraction
17,RavenGlamDVDCollector,"every bit as irritating as Brett's ""American Psycho""",7,22 September 2016,"If you've read Brett Easton Ellis's landmark anti-social novel, you would know that it is not a user-friendly read. The book spits in your face every now and then, and regularly behaves just like a spoiled brat with bad table manners generally trying to upset easily up-settable targets. There are drawn out passages celebrating nihilism ad infinitum beyond the point of despair. Why read it? Because it is fascinating, you know something big is gonna come, and you struggle through the experience to get there.This movie is the same. For the most part, the screen is filled with junk. It's the kind of thing I would have loved to break away from. Who wants to watch this? These dumb-ass smarmy guys, they need a good proper solid slap through their smug cute-guy faces, and they'd be gone like bad smells in the wind.But I enlisted to see Jessica Biel, one of the prettiest actresses ever to grace the small/silver screen. And she is absolutely glorious in this movie, albeit cast as the loose girl we are all supposed to dislike. Her biggest on-screen sin is that she has no respect for her body, overdoing drugs. She then gets zonked out, leading to her altercation with the entire football team. But I couldn't dislike her. There are so many thoroughly nauseating boys in this movie, I couldn't. Why do the dorky boys not get their just desserts, it is only Jessica who gets knocked down?Generally hated the movie for the most part upon first seeing it, but the second viewing, it proved to be more popular. The music is great, more than great, every note fits in harmoniously. I really like (underemployed) Kate bi-color eyes Bosworth and even more underemployed Clare Kramer, more should have been seen of them. As for the main story, it's got that PULP FICTION this-is-not-a- serious- movie feel to it. A crowd-pleaser for the rowdy masses. I'd just bet these foul-mouthed oafs became role models for many of the 2001 generation. Which is a sad comment on the decline of Western Civilization.",The Rules of Attraction
18,Agent10,Brilliant and indulgant film,9,10 November 2002,"Say what you will, say what you may, this film is utter brilliance. Creativity and artistry cubed. Just downright interesting. The faint of heart and the those that like popcorn movies should stay away from this dense and complicated film about substance abusing, sexually frustrated college students. Roger Avary has created an epic of sorts, one of the artistic and postmodern, one which tends to defy the boundaries good taste while adding some much needed spice to the mix. The cinematography, the reverse sound and photography, and the other experimental movements within this film will make it difficult to equal. It will stand as its own film, much like Fight Club, Pulp Fiction, Magnolia and Apocalypse Now. I especially thought the individual performances within the film were excellent, and James van der Beek made me a believer in his talent (now if he would just dump that god-awful Dawson's Creek). Don't watch this film if you think Titanic was a good film or you're type of acting is the schlocky and stigmatic type by the likes of Cruise, Roberts, Affleck and J.Lo. Dare to be challenged.",The Rules of Attraction
19,Boyo-2,"Self-indulgent college kids, but I liked it",7,24 December 2003,"The main characters are not always as interesting or well presented as  they should be, so its very hard to care about them that much. You kind  of know their particular plight, without them having to spell it out,  but some insight into each person might not have hurt too much. Each  character narrates a large part of their own story. However, the  director does a lot with the material to keep it lively. You get split  screens, backwards running film, slow motion, etc. and it fits the  subject perfectly.  Cameos are interesting, to say the least - its not every movie where  you get to see Fred Savage strung out, or see an insane  emergency room doctor. Eric Stoltz, Faye Dunaway and Swoozie Kurtz are  also aboard but don't stay around for too long.   The character Kip Pardue plays, Victor, gets a bit of a raw deal, as  he's seen in the beginning for a minute, then again at the end, when  you get a video diary, of sorts, of his escapades around Europe. In the  book he's handled differently. I like Kip, who played Sunshine in  ""Remember the Titans"" and was also in that stupid race car movie with  Sly Stallone and Burt Reynolds. I had a shrink hypnotize me so I'd  forget the name of that one, but Kip was in it, that much I remember.   My favorite character by light years is Richard (sorry...he prefers  Dick, and loves saying it), who's a friend/lover of Paul (Ian  Somerhalder, who's great). Dick is in the movie for about ten minutes  but makes a lasting impression, dancing on a hotel bed with Paul to the  strains of George Michael's ""Faith"", then having a hysterically funny  scene in the hotel w/Paul and their Moms. NO ONE in the movie is as  much fun as Dick, and I was a bit letdown when he exited. He seemed to  have a wild sense of humor about how screwed up he was.  I've seen this about five times by now. I don't love it, and I have  some problems with some of the overkill, but I like it a lot. 7/10.",The Rules of Attraction
20,Jonny_Numb,the best film of 2002,8,17 March 2003,"I traveled about 2 hours to a suburb just outside of Philadelphia to see ""The Rules of Attraction"" with a friend who is also a big fan of Bret Easton Ellis.  I'd read the book over a year before the movie came out, and still have fond memories of its humor, drama, and apathetic characters (in my opinion, it's Ellis's best work).  I went into the theater with the high expectation that this had been done right, and left feeling the same way. The 2-hour trip was well worth it.  The book was a collection of passages taken from the POV of a handful of college students over the course of a semester as they drink, screw, attempt suicide, and seldom go to class. Ellis's deadpan approach to the characters provided drama and strong humor in generous doses...the mix was unusually balanced and memorable.  The same can be said of Roger Avary's adaptation.  He whittles the focus down to four main characters--Sean Bateman (James Van Der Beek), Lauren Hynde (Shannyn Sossaman), Paul Denton (Ian Somerhalder), and Victor Ward (Kip Pardue)--whose lives intersect in a fractured love triangle.  Viewers looking for transparently sympathetic characters will be turned off; but those who can sense the mockery of this vacuousness in Ellis's prose will understand Avary's achievement in the adaptation (Mary Harron performed a similar feat with Ellis's ""American Psycho"").  The way it's pounded into us that these characters care about nothing but their own pleasure gradually turns them into pillars of morality as they develop throughout the film. Avary's adaptation is tight (taking a few welcome liberties with the material), and his direction is excellent (the first scene is a wonderful setpiece) even if he can't sustain high energy the whole way through.  My only real complaint is a lot of distracting post-modern touches that seem self indulgent (a film student mentions Quentin Tarantino, Avary's former collaborator; a girl wears a Tomandandy shirt; a Nietzsche quote is scrawled on a blackboard, etc.).  But other than that, ""The Rules of Attraction"" is the best movie of 2002.8/10",The Rules of Attraction
21,rbverhoef,Visually great,8,1 June 2003,"At the ""The End of the World Party"" Lauren (Shannyn Sossamon) is introduced, we go back in time in a really cool sequence. Paul (Ian Somerhalder) is introduced, and again we go back in time and again it looks pretty cool. Sean Bateman (James Van Der Beek) is introduced, and then the opening credits appear before the story really starts, some time earlier than the party.We learn that Sean Bateman is a drug-dealer and Paul is gay or may be bi-sexual because he had a thing with Lauren. We arrive on the ""The Edge of the World Party"" where Paul and Sean meet. Paul invites Sean for a party the next day.The next day starts with a visually great sequence where Lauren and Sean meet. They both have a class on Saturday that isn't there. Left in the screen we see Sean, right we see Lauren, even during their conversation. Then both the cameras get together and we have one screen again. Sean was getting secret love letters and after the way they meet he thinks Lauren is the one who is sending them. Later that next day. On the party, a ""Pre-Saturday Night Party Party"", Paul explains to Sean why he is late. Sean has no idea what he is talking about. Paul is in love with him but all Sean is thinking about is Lauren. Sex with Lauren actually, on the ""Dressed to Get Screwed Party"". What happens from that point on I will not reveal, accept for one thing. After all this Victor (Kip Pardue) is introduced, in again a great sequence. He is the ex-boyfriend of Lauren, a friend of Sean and he used have something with Paul as well...For me the movie was not really about the story. It was not bad and had some good laughs in it as well, but what was so amazing was the visual style and the way the whole thing was presented to us. I talked about the split screen and the introducing of the characters. But also look the way a snowflake is used to turn into a tear.

23,rosscinema,Interesting but uneven,5,15 December 2003,"This is a film about a very unlikely love triangle and its told through a varying array of flashbacks and scenes that are told out of order like ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""21 Grams"". This film takes place at a New England college called Camden and James Van Der Beek plays Sean Bateman who is a drug dealer and beds every female that he can. The college is infamous for its wild parties and drugs and it doesn't seem that anyone has time to study. Sean has a gay friend named Paul (Ian Somerhalder) and he doesn't know it but Paul is in love with him. Sean also starts to get friendly with Lauren (Shannyn Sossamon) who is a virgin but has been casually dating Victor (Kip Pardue) but both she and Sean have an attraction to each other.
*****SPOILER ALERT*****This film opens with a scene at a wild drunken party and Lauren is so drunk that she decides to lose her virginity. But in the bedroom she passes out and later awakens to a stranger having sex with her. Sean has fallen in love with her but at another party he starts talking to Lauren's roommate Lara (Jessica Biel) and later has sex with her which Lauren finds out about and this pretty much ruins his chances of getting to know her better.
This film was directed by Roger Avary who really shows talent as a filmmaker who can tell his stories from different angles and with an abundant of style. The structure of the film is told practically in reverse with the use of flashbacks. Some of the scenes just stop and then start to go backward to another point in time. This is interesting to watch but ultimately the film becomes just an exercise in style. The characters are extremely shallow and greedy and its hard to care for them but they are fairly interesting to watch. Van Der Beek is effective as Sean and he shows a character that seems unable to have a real relationship. Sossamon also is pretty good and her character is a little more mature although she's far from being of sound judgment. The casting is interesting and many familiar faces pop up in small roles like an unrecognizable Fred Savage as a drug addict. Eric Stoltz is a teacher and singer Paul Williams plays an unsympathetic doctor. Swoosie Kurtz and Faye Dunaway both have roles as mothers and Dunaway barely has anything to say. There is a bit of interesting trivia with this film and its with the character Sean. This film is based on the novel by Bret Easton Ellis who also wrote ""American Psycho"" and the character in that story is named Patrick Bateman. Sean Bateman is suppose to be Patrick's younger brother. This film is well made and the performances are good but by the end we discover that this is mainly about shallow characters who have not yet figured out how to have a real relationship.",The Rules of Attraction

All of these students are totally immoral and it's tough job trying to feel sympathy, but after about two hours you do have the compassion. And you've had a lot of fun. The scene with the boys and their mothers at the posh restaurant is fantastic, although very obscene.Good work by director Roger Avary and especially by James Van Der Beek as Sean Bateman.

25,jaredmobarak,You better bring back change; Daddy wants changeThe Rules of Attraction,9,4 September 2006,"After viewing The Rules of Attraction, one can definitely see how Roger Avary and Quentin Tarantino were friends. Upon leaving their jobs as video store clerks, the two went out and did Reservoir Dogs together, before collaborating on Pulp Fiction. Tarantino took all the credit for those two movies, basically striking Avary out of Dogs completely and only giving him story credit for Pulp. With Rules of Attraction, one sees that there was probably more influence on both films. While this adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' novel contains many clichéd style maneuvers, they all work effectively in telling the tale. Multiple uses of rewind, spilt screen, and the re-showing of events could have been a drastic failure of cheap trickery with less able hands. Here, though, Avary shows some skill and uses everything to further advance a complicated tapestry of story lines and encounters from the stellar cast of young up-and-comers.This is a story about a weekend of college partying at Camden. We have co-eds of all grades, races, and sexual orientation weaving in and out of each other's lives, going from party to party, having altercations, conversations, and a lot of casual sex. James Van Der Beek is actually really quite good breaking out of his good boy image from WB-fare casting. His performance really makes me wish his sanitized image didn't warrant Todd Solondz from cutting his arc from the disturbingly good Storytelling. Shannon Sossamon does admirably as the confused girl rooming with a slut, doing drugs, but wanting to stay pure for the man of her dreams. It is this conflicting nature that runs rampant throughout each character's existence. The dry, cynical humor prevalent in another Ellis adaptation, American Psycho, carries through here as well. Without so much satire from that film, Rules reaches an absurdity at times that makes you think back to your college days and the craziness and emotional stupidity you remember seeing from those surrounding you.I give Avary a lot of credit for his sense of detail too. The soundtrack enhances each scene, where it is used, effectively, most noticeably with the hilarious juxtaposition of Ian Somerhalder and Russell Sams dancing and lip-synching to a George Michael song on a hotel bed with their mothers in the dining hall swapping prescription drugs between sips of vodka. Little scenes like seeing a suicide being lifted into an ambulance, students crying all around, with a girl hitting on one of the police officers in the foreground are brilliant. Avary makes the viewer never take a break as there is no telling what he/she might miss. Also, the casting choices are superb in every instance. Clifton Collins Jr. is menacingly funny as a drug supplier, Eric Stoltz creepily spot-on in a small role, Faye Dunnaway hamming it up in the aforementioned hotel dining scene, and Fred Savage in a gem of a cameo.Even when you think the gimmicks are through, and we have linear storyline normality, we are treated to a fast-paced recap of Kip Pardue's character's trip to Europe. The matter-of- fact nature in which the sequence is narrated during its quick cut montage is great. Supposedly this footage was edited into a bridge film called Gliterrati, to connect Rules to a future film adaptation of Ellis' Glamorama. Unfortunately it has not been released in its full form and Glamorama has been removed from Avary's slate of upcoming films. Either way, The Rules of Attraction allows for the hope that we will see more Ellis-based films. If nothing else I can't wait to break into the collection of his works sitting unopened on my bookshelf, waiting to be read for the past year or so.",The Rules of Attraction
26,mattymatt4ever,"Not your average teen movie, but it's still a piece of crap",2,5 May 2003,"If there's one good thing I have to say about your average teen fluff flick, it's that at least they don't pretend to be holier-than-thou.  The makers of ""She's All That"" and ""Never Been Kissed"" didn't pretend that they were making ""Richard III.""  ""The Rules of Attraction"" is unbelievably pretentious.  The minute you start watching this movie, you can explicitly visualize the director doing an interview and gloating about how ""this is not your average teen movie.""  I don't care if this were a senior citizen film--it's crap!!Roger Avary definitely has a great style, which especially shows in one scene in which James Van Der Beek and Shannon Sosseman are talking to each other, and we see close-ups on each of their faces through a split-screen. There are also many moments in which Van Der Beek gives an evil stare into the camera, which was obviously inspired from Stanley Kubrick, who used that with method with Malcolm McDowell in ""A Clockwork Orange,"" Jack Nicholson in ""The Shining"" and Vincent D'Onofrio in ""Full Metal Jacket.""
The problem?  The story just isn't interesting.  It's a complete bore! There are some slick lines of dialogue, which were obviously taken from the Bret Easton Ellis novel--one of his trademarks being his knack for extraordinary detail.  In a better script with a better story, these elements could've strengthened the film, but instead it just builds a slick facade over a pretty hollow piece of cinema.  When it all boils down to it, it's a simple story about jealousy, betrayal, philandering, sexual promiscuity, virginity--the same themes in every teen film!The actors can't be to blame either.  Van Der Beek perhaps gives the finest performances of his career, and has the aforementioned evil stare down pat. And he doesn't play the same lovestruck teen character, which is probably why he seemed to have been having so much fun in his performance.  Shannon Sosseman (I'm sure I'm spelling her name wrong) is also perfectly cast. And the film definitely provides great eye candy with such stunningly hot actresses as Jessica Biel and Kate Bosworth.  The scene where a drunken Jessica parades through the halls half-naked is definitely worth rewinding over and over again.I liked the soundtrack, which contains some great 80's tunes like ""Move Out"" and ""Faith.""  I know, I know.  It sounds as if I'm actually commending the film.  That shows what kind of damage a badly written script can do on a film.  Not to mention the film is totally dreary and depressing in tone. The film was marketed as your standard teen film, which is evident through its trailers and TV spots, which included the great song ""She Hates Me"" by Puddle of Mudd.  To be honest, it looked to be like a sex comedy, but as it turns out, it's far from it.""The Rules of Attraction"" is both boring and unpleasant.  My instincts tell me this will receive a minor cult status, as it looks like the type of film you either love or hate.  Well, I hated it.My score:  2 (out of 10)",The Rules of Attraction

You'd expect this to be a marriage of the two. It has a tremendous amount in common with A Clockwork Orange in terms of editing and character development. Also, if the psychotic nature of the main character Sean gave you flashbacks to American Psycho, that's because he actually is supposed to be Patrick Bateman's younger brother.

28,TOMASBBloodhound,One good scene in a sea of nihilistic crap.,3,8 January 2006,"This film has one good scene. One. This scene should have been made into a short film and released as an extra feature on the DVD of a good film. Most of you who have seen the movie can probably guess which scene I'm referring to. It's the one where a character quickly describes a trip through Europe and all the excess that came with it. If you take out that scene, this film is worth about one star.The Rules of Attraction is mess. The film doesn't exactly have an actual plot. It's just a series of people getting drunk, taking drugs, and having sex while tucked away at college. Very funny and interesting films dealing with the same subject matter (Animal House would be a good example) have been made before. However the original source for this material is the infamous Bret Easton Ellis who has given us American Psycho and Less Than Zero. Those two books were made into much better films than this one. Despite not having too many positive characters, those films at least had INTERESTING characters. The Rules of Attraction has nothing to offer us except boring; self-loathing jerks.There was not one character I did not dislike to some degree or another. Most of them I absolutely hated. Most of these actors are more than competent in other films where they have gotten the chance to play people we actually care about. In this film, we just want them to shut up or go ahead and off themselves is that's what they intend to do.Roger Avary shows some definite skill behind the camera, but there was nothing here that was really worth filming. We also have Mr. Avary to thank for the script. The film didn't cost much to make, nor did it create a large profit. I'm sure the theatrical release was minimal and short-lived.To sum things up, don't waste your time on this film or these characters. Sure when I was in college I did a lot of the same things, but there always seemed to be a smile on my face while I was doing them. These characters, like most in Easton's stories, are always partying, but they never seem to be enjoying it. 3 of 10 stars.The Hound.",The Rules of Attraction
29,TheNorthernMonkee,an awful film attempted badly in a clever way,2,3 February 2004,"SPOILERS?Truth be told, this review will probably be one of the smallest reviews I've ever written. The reasoning is that I simply didn't get this film!""The Rules Of Attraction"" starts James Van Der Beek of ""Dawsons Creek"" fame as Sean Bateman (younger brother of the other Bateman from ""American Psycho""), a screwed up individual who takes ridiculous ammounts of drugs and who's life is all in all pretty pointless. His friends Lauren and Paul (played by Shannyn Sossamon and Ian Somerhalder) are also living relatively irrelevant lives on campus. This lovetriangle as it develops (Paul is homosexual and loves Sean, whilst Sean loves Lauren) is a combination of confused signals from each other and some purple letters Sean Bateman thinks are sent from Lauren. I'd like to write more about the plot, but to be honest, I'm unsure if there really is any more to that. Picturing the ending, I question if the dvd was scratched or something as it makes absolutely zero sense.When analysing this film, it's ridiculously difficult. Roger Avary the director deserves praise for attempting to present the film in a novel way involving rewinding time, but he deserves criticism for doing it in a way which just causes confusion and/or frustration. The three main stars are acceptable in their roles and I kind of feel sorry for them for having such a pathetic script to work off.The ultimate flaw with ""The Rules Of Attraction"" is that it tries to be artistic, almost for arts sake. There is one scene where Sean Bateman is sat in the snow drinking from a bottle of Jack Daniels (that's the other problem, the ammount this guy drinks in one go in this film is completely unrealistic. He'd be unconscious, possibly with alcohol poisoning if it was real), and just staring into space. Now that one image is in itself actually quite beautiful, but then the story is forced to take place and the whole scene is ruined.I guess in the end of the day, I will sit myself down one day in the distant future and attempt to once more understand this movie. This will not be for a very long time though. There are better ways to spend my life, the snowball fight I had after it for two hours for one, and if I find myself being forced to watch this movie again anytime within the next two years, it will be too soon.",The Rules of Attraction
30,jpschapira,What lies beneath the usual...,7,10 May 2005,"I had forgotten about ""college movies"". I have seen many of them, and, as you know, it's all basically cliché and formula. Unbelievably, this is one of the reasons why, in its genre, but not probably as a movie, ""The Rules of attraction"" is a 7 out of 10. There's something more about the characters and their stories; there's emotion and even drama.Directed with a style of his own, Roger Avary achieves backward scenes, and we see the stories as if we were rewinding a movie; this movie. The truth is they got very excited with the phenomenon, showing the credits in backwards, and doing another weird stuff; but it worked. The movie has some over the top cool scenes; they're having doing this. There was a very simple and flawed edition, I must say; with the wrong and inadequate blackouts Although you can't think Avary didn't take it seriously, because he did. Adapting Bret Easton Ellis' novel, Avary took charge of everything, making sure the music suited perfectly with each scene (we get music from the 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's and now; great musical job, for a work with mostly unoriginal than original music). Easton Ellis could have been in college when he wrote the novel, because he seems to be inside this world. As not many other movies of this type do, ""The Rules of attraction"" makes us believe that everything is real, because of the way it is treated; you don't get the stereotyped characters we always see in these films, each person is different, how everybody talks, locations, marijuana, relationships; it's crazy! Well, someone is allowed to be a little crazy to create a story that goes like this: A popular guy called Sean, who says to be poor to sell drugs to the rich people in school, but is rich actually, and gets the drugs from a drug addict that could kill him; and he fucks a lot of girls, but then falls in love with one; Lauren, who used to date Paul, who now is gay and likes Sean, and Sean knows a guy named Victor, who goes to Europe to do crazy starts and is Lauren's impossible love, and Lara, Lauren's roommate, also likes him, but Lara has had sex with everyone, and now she wants to do it with Sean, but Lauren probably likes SeanSee? There's love, too. The development you will see; I won't say more.These characters are portrayed by a very interesting cast. Sean is played by James Van Der Beek and the truth is, he's getting old for this stuff. I mean, it's his type of film and he was good in ""Dawson's Creek"", but still is the actor from that show who improved the less (Katie Holmes is rising; Joshua Jackson is still there). I liked him ""Texas Rangers"", but here he just seems the same. Now what can I say about Shannyn Sossamon? She's absolutely gorgeous and charming besides being a fine actress who hasn't made one false move. She plays Lauren with that charm and that originality. She has a long career waiting. Kip Pardue plays Victor with a personality created by him; I couldn't recognize him. He seems totally different from the Kip Pardue I met in Renny Harlin's ""Driven"". I've heard of his performance in ""This Girl's Life"", and I know he's a good actor. He added a lot to the film. Jessica Biel, as Lara, managed to shoe to me once again that she is incapable of composing a role, and that she continues to be ""just"" a pretty face. Ian Somerhalder; great groove man! I watch him every week in ""Lost"" and I saw him in this movie, so subtle, so controlledHe steals the film. Thomas Ian Nicholas and Kate Bosworth work as ornaments, but Clifton Collins Jr That's ""The Man"" right there. One hundred percent of quality and style.I'm glad I found a script in which the characters talk and say deep things like: ""You never get to know anyone good""; at the same time they're thinking about their sexual relationships and assure: ""I knew from the start that this would happen. I knew it was going to end like this"", or that something is ""typical""; ""The Rules of attraction"" shows hope in this type of cinema.In this film, just to go on about its originality, there's a possibility that things en up badly, or that things don't end at all. But there are real looks, like in profound movies; there are no clichés, like in the movies that stand out; there's tragedy, like in a drama; and it's just another movie in the genreRock and roll!",The Rules of Attraction
31,bregund,"All Style, No Substance",1,16 March 2003,"This ugly, pointless film uses neat film techniques and strange music to showcase, for some strange reason, the dregs of humanity.  Swearing, sex, homophobia, drinking, drugs, masturbation...it just goes on and on, long after you're tired of watching it.  Here's a tip for the filmmaker:  shock value only works if you have realistic situations for balance.

32,charchuk,Disturbingly brilliant,7,1 July 2006,"A difficult movie to grade. On the one hand, it's quite disturbing, overtly confusing, and utterly pointless. On the other, it's darkly comical, occasionally brilliant, and frequently hilarious. Definitely one of a kind. Some parts of it are disgusting in their offensiveness, whilst others are incredible in their wit. Some of the comic gems are Victor's recap of his Eurotrip and the character of Dick - who has a brilliant, five minute showing, and then never shows up again. The plot winds about, making little to no sense but capturing attentions anyway. The characters are sad, pathetic, and deeply intriguing. The cinematography and editing are a bit flashy but worthy of it. The music is well-chosen but can be a bit over the top at times. All in all, a wildly original and depressingly dark film.",The Rules of Attraction
33,nobbytatoes,tuff love,9,3 November 2005,"Lauren is a virgin. She has been waiting for her love interest Victor, but he's currently tracking around Europe. Before she goes out to parties, she looks through her big book of venereal diseases to stop her from having sex. But she starts to fall for Sean. Sean is a drug dealer and is very self centered; all he is looking for is his next hit of drugs and the next person to sleep with. Sean is interested in Lauren, but also with her roommate; Lara. Completing this love triangle is Paul. Paul is a bisexual; he use to date Lauren, but now he is gay. Paul likes Sean; thinking Sean is bi. These three people might be stuck in this love triangle, but there's no love to go around.The problem with these three is that they want to love, but they can't. They're are all self centered ignorant of others. But that's their redeeming feature; you still want to know them even if they're hard to access and understand. Nearly everyone has their own agenda here, and they don't really care who they hurt in the process. They are basically leeched from the pages of the book, as Bret Easton Ellis did write them are very annoying characters. The acting though is good. All the actors fit well with their characters. Van Der Beek oozes sleaze and self confidence as Sean. Sossamon is great as the fragile Lauren, and Somerhalder is good as Paul looking for love in the wrong places.Roger Avary direction is very good. You can see he took awhile to get all the sets right so the reverse shots all connect and keep the continuity running. At the start we see a lot of the reverse shots, seeing one point of time through the three characters view points. But then it seem to have disappeared near the end. We also have a few split screen shots, which work quite effectively. This does keep up the pace so it doesn't get real boring to watch. There are some parts that do fall flat, but they are matched with some great scenes. Victor's fast paced story of his trip to Europe, Sean and Mitch's drug deal with Rupet gone wrong. The stand out is the second Richard, Dick as he calls himself, enters. Its a constant laugh when Pauls and his mother are meeting her friend and Richard, with Richard drunk off his face and cracking on to Paul. The stuff that slurs from Richards mouth is just side splitting.The soundtrack is also great. We are treated to a lot of great songs, but doesn't feel like Avary has just swallowed a juke box and is just spitting songs out, the songs increase the strength of many scenes.This is also different to Bret Easton Ellis's Book of the same title. Though a lot is still the same, there are some major differences. In the book Sean and Lauren were a couple and in the movie they aren't. But Roger Avary has done a great job at transferring the book to screenplay, and the changes make it more of his own world, not that of Ellis's.It's abit of a mixed affair, but its one wild ride that delivers a great watch.",The Rules of Attraction
34,La Gremlin,Men = Germs,7,30 May 2003,"Here's a rollicking good movie about how women are inherently good and men are inherently horrible, vile little creatures.

35,B24,Grudging Admiration,6,6 March 2005,"Structurally, this production has much going for it: good camera work, decent direction, characters that are more than cardboard cutouts, and an actual beginning and end in spite of its trendy flashes forwards and backwards.As compelling drama, however, it falls flat. As in all the works of author Ellis, an urge to sensationalize ordinary human behavior by way of portraying it as grotesque arrives without any center or meaning. Unlike political satire or compelling internal psychodrama, for example, such effort lacks any objective frame of reference. Revealing frailties and hypocrisies of contemporary college students in the rarefied and exclusive atmosphere of (transparently) Bennington College is in and of itself something of a bore. Sex, drugs, and rock and roll have been done to death in films much better than this one.I was nevertheless much impressed that some of the principal actors and cameos went so clearly against type. It took guts for teen idol Van Der Beek to take on the role of a hyposexed drug dealer, or for grand dames like Kurtz and Dunaway to play sappy old broads. There are other little bits of acting to admire here as well, so it is far from a complete loss.",The Rules of Attraction
36,chron,A Wandering Plot with Lots of Bad Acting,4,8 November 2004,"This has a wandering, sometimes incoherent plot that winds among multiple characters, but accomplishes little dramatically.Most surprising is the lack of acting talent. Even accomplished actors like Faye Dunaway failed to bring their acting chops. Russell Sams turns out one of the worst acting performances I have ever seen. Jessica Biel rates pretty low on the talent meter. This is the first movie I have seen her in and it is apparent that she gets jobs for reasons other than her craft.The direction is very spotty. The reactions by the actors in their situations feel contrived. It doesn't seem the fault of the screenplay as much as the direction. Roger Avary is responsible for both. He needs to stick to writing.The writing isn't bad, but I failed to connect with the characters. I like young people - but these characters were immature more so than just young. I hope that twenty-somethings are more collected than they are portrayed here. I know I was when I was that age.This ends up an very unfulfilling movie experience.

39,mistoppi,Weird mess,4,24 April 2017,"The Rules of Attraction is definitely an interesting movie. One of the most interesting things about it was that my whole view of the movie changed after I had seen it and I saw on IMDb it was based on a novel by Bret Easton Ellis. Everything weird about this movie suddenly made way more sense when you know it's written by the same guy who wrote Less Than Zero and American Psycho. Also helped when I actually remembered ho Roger Avary is. But knowing the minds behind the movie doesn't help me like it any more. I started watching this movie only because of Clifton Collins Jr and the fact that I haven't seen him enough - only in one TV Show and one movie, where he only has a small role. Since he was there for, what, three scenes, I didn't exactly get what I wanted out of this movie, and it didn't manage to surprise me positively. Ultimately there was a certain to this movie that I found interesting, something that reminds me of few of my favourite movies about people as old (or young) as these characters. However that was fleeting since most of the movie seemed to be annoying relationship, sex and romance drama that I didn't actually give a damn about. And still when the movie's summaries talk about a love triangle, I feel like it wasn't even about that. That had so little to do with everything else that was going on. I can't say if the novel is long or not, but I feel there is too much packed into this movie.I liked many details about this movie. The soundtrack was good, the inner monologues were interesting, the cinematography... well it honestly made me think Clifton Collins Jr was going to jump through the screen and kill me, also I never knew I'd see James Van Der Beek's O-face that close... But the entirety just felt fake artsy and like a really weird mess. When you know who's behind it, it kind of explains that. It makes more sense, but it doesn't make it better",The Rules of Attraction
40,HenryHextonEsq,"A very mixed bag, but redeemable. (Some spoilers)",7,4 May 2003,"Perhaps surprisingly enjoyable, ""The Rules of Attraction"" is a strange beast: part exposure of the artifice and posturing of Reagan's America and of 'Generation X' and part ""Fight Club""-esque ambivalent support for today's individualist, consumer culture. Add to that a few strands of real feeling, a good deal of disenchanting, 'cool' voiceover smugness (portentous ""I always knew it was going to be like this""'s, without real reason) and some very shocking sequences - one disturbing and one just appalling - and you have a film without a settled purpose.The central premise, emphasized with the recurring dialogue - ""No one ever really knows anyone else... You're never going to know me"" - is evidently played out in the shallow, hateful characters' behaviour throughout the film. They care about nothing than a fulfillment of base desires; hollow are the centres of these characters. Sean Bateman - rather convincingly, swaggeringly portrayed by James Van Der Beek - spouts the above words as some sort of justification; they mean no more than his almost sinister, empty muttering of ""Rock'n'Roll"" when action is nearby. It is Shannyn Sossamon's Lauren Hynde who invests the words with poignancy; as I really found myself caring for her character: a unique position in a film peopled by fashionable grotesques, dulled malcontents and stereotypes set amok. You don't really care when Sean does break down into tears; as his loss of Lauren is thoroughly deserved. It is too late for the character to become 'human'; the 'vampire' will always win out.Now, Shannyn Sossamon; she gives a quite sublime performance in this film, difficult to quantify in its unassuming skill. I'd only previously seen her in ""A Knight's Tale"" - adequately winning in a limited role - but from the evidence of her acting here, this is a young actress to watch in future years. She plays the part with a languorous fatalism: youth afraid of not being fulfilled, emotions just about repressed and kept under wraps. She will find no match in the world of this film; Sean Bateman is a figure all the more sickening because of his omnipotent, everyman status - manifested in voice-overs and the most screen time of all characters.Sossamon's tenderness, and nervous, romantic playfulness is found alien in the almost nightmarish, insolent landscape of this film. The acclaimed scene in the college building with Sossamon and Van Der Beek approaching each other - with the rigorous, POV shots being maintained to the furthest point - is splendidly done; Donovan's ""Colours"" all the more poignant in its gentleness due to the film's subsequent events and our knowledge of Bateman's character. A real tragic pathos cuts into the later scene where Lauren calls on her presumed 'current boyfriend' (who has been travelling around Europe; an empty jaunt conveyed bleakly in staccato lines, read quickly by the actor 'gainst a backdrop of partial, flickering images), Victor (Kip Pardue), who doesn't even remember her and is harbouring a hooker in his room. The scene speaks volumes; the self-delusion and fault of Sossamon in building up a falsely rosy image of Victor proves shocking, when we are presented with the reality of this seedy, wilfully shallow nobody. The wider tragedy is that there is nowhere for Lauren to go after this; but to the appalling opening events of the film. She cannot turn to anyone of worth: her flatmate is a wanton, blonde Jessica Biel, airheaded and indifferent, and no men are trustworthy.And to this opening scene, which is frankly ""utterly disgusting"" as the dour intellectual Tom Paulin hectored on the BBC's ""Newsnight Review"". There was no need to put the audience through all *that*; we would be distanced enough from the characters and their world simply by the rest of the film, which would do this subtly without this opening graphic ""pornography"". A scene that combines shock effect with emotional effect is the suicide scene; odd to think that Nilsson's staggering ""Without You"" had perhaps never before been use din such a way. Its use, bursting in and out of focus, reverberating around the theatre, was shattering. One has been set up expecting Lauren to be badly hurt at this juncture; but the actual writer of the letters to Bateman is the one who really cannot go on (the girl not figuring at all in Bateman's muted consciousness, and indeed by extension not given a line in the film). It is a bravura, compelling sequence; the end of a life and of a love unrequited, shown in chillingly sporadic detail. The music tearing down into your soul. But what a curious thing this film proves to be; while it does follow this up with the conclusion of Lauren's story mirroring this - love is impossible; death is accepted in the seedy sex she succumbs to at the film's beginning-end - much of the running time is given over to strange bits of overplayed, crude comedy. Best is the hospital scene; the doctor seeming to be playing absurdist tricks a la David Cann in Chris Morris' ""Jam"". Otherwise, you have Clifton Collins Jr. guesting as one Rupert Guest; clearly a character from Ellis' book, but having little relevance to the central themes of this film. It's just a turn, as is the admittedly amusing schtick of Russell Sams as ""Dick"" Jared, who bizarrely only appears in one extended scene - a vulgar scene that works because he is *so* over-playing his comedic delivery. And also; an unexplained citation of ""The Wicker Man"" as a wicker man is burnt in the early scene where the underwritten gay character, Paul Denton, thinks he's got a 'date' with Bateman. Curious stuff.I would actually agree with Tom Paulin that this film is a ""very stupid film"", in many ways; as it muffles its core message, and is very unfocused in dealing with the basic story. But it is not, as he says, ""unredeemable""; Sossamon redeems the film with her wonderfully moving, quietly emotional performance. There are fine touches of direction, and a well selected 60s-70s poignant-retro soundtrack (Starland Vocal Band's ""Afternoon Delight"" anyone?) but the film's degree of success has to go down to the captivating, lip-biting figure of Shannyn Sossamon. A sublime performance in a film impressive on the surface, but without due focus or direction.Rating:- *** 1/2/*****",The Rules of Attraction
41,foxtografo,Completely disliked it.,3,2 June 2014,"""American Psycho"" is one of my favourite movies of all time. I just re- watched it a couple night ago, and reading the trivia and info about it I found out about this movie that is based in a book from the same author. It sounded interesting that the main character was the younger brother of such a character like Patrick Bateman. ""The rules of attraction"" is one of the worst movies I remember watching. I always give movies a chance until the end, to see if I like at least one or a few aspects of the movie, I rarely stop watching at 15 minutes (only a couple times out of hundred of movies I've seen), but this was really hard to finish. Not because of the content or for being rough, but it looked so poorly done. When it was 15 minutes I was already annoyed by the nonsensical abuse of reverse camera, which looked pretentious and after the third consecutive use I was rolling my eyes. All that just to introduce 3 very shallow, uninteresting characters that never get really related in a way that makes me feel for them or them situation. The acting was terrible. The main, Van Der Veck never looked psycho to me (I don't know if he was supposed to be) but more like moronic, airhead, completely overacted and lack of charisma. Nothing interesting to do, say or even try to accomplish. Sossamon was the fairest of all, which is not so much, as her character didn't make much sense in an non existent plot. No point on commenting the rest of the cast (Somerhalder, Collins Jr., etc) , it felt so overacted (sorry for repeating the word so many times but I can't think of any other more accurate) and poorly directed that would take too much to describe such a bad overall. The story was empty, the characters were empty, and the dialogues were... empty! I fast forwarded long, awkward, pointless, not even fun scenes, to see if anything was happening afterwards, but 2hr watched in maybe 1 and half was an eternity to spend suffering it. I guess I should have quit it in the beginning, but how should I know? Didn't like photography, music, or anything in it, I know it sounds very ""troll"" like, but is the truth, usually when I like anything from a movie I try to give it a better rating because of it, but here's nothing to add up. Of course this is my opinion, and rarely I spend so much time in something I don't like, but as this has so many good reviews in general, I was wondering what people liked about it...Poor photography, bad acting, story and writing.. A complete waste of time, in my humble opinion, I can't think of a single thing I liked about this movie, I wish I never found out about it. I'll stick to ""American Psycho"", this is completely out of the league.",The Rules of Attraction

43,Tiger_Mark,What A Mess!,2,11 August 2003,"When I saw that they were going to attempt to make this book a motion picture, I was a bit skeptical. I knew that the success of Ellis' ""American Psycho"" would prompt studios to seek out more of his work. Of course, Bret Easton Ellis has a knack for writing incredibly detailed novels, which are hard to slim down to two hours or less. Moreover, I think most forgot ""Less Than Zero"" which to put it nicely, was a flop. Which begs the question, does Ellis write books that transfer well to the big screen or does Mary Harron (American Psycho) just happen to be one great director? Well, I am leaning towards the later. ""The Rules of Attraction"" is a mess from start to finish. Performances are over done and unlikable. However, I think that Roger Avary believes that if he plays enough music, he can disguise it. In fact, this movie does sometimes seem like one long music video. However, as this trainwreck moved on, I kept finding myself less and less interested. A depressing story told rather poorly. But hey, a lot of the music was good.",The Rules of Attraction
44,film_riot,The Rules of Attraction,7,6 November 2007,"Roger Avary adapted the screenplay from a novel by Bret Easton Ellis and directed ""The Rules of Attraction"". He uses a very energetic style, voice-over, non-linear time structure and has some nice directorial ideas, like for example the scene where he uses split screen to show Sean and Lauren getting up in the morning until they ultimately meet in the hallway of the university. Great scene. The film is in general very funny and it is also a sociocritical commentary on youth in our society. There were also parts in ""The Rules of Attraction"" I rather disliked. The whole gangster storyline with Rupert seemed unfitting and a too cool. Going on my nerves was the preachy undertone in the final lines from Lauren and Paul. James van der Beek may have the best role of his life in this film, he is actually really great and far away from being Dawson.

47,K-Slicer,Gagworthy as opposed to praiseworthy,2,9 June 2003,"I am possibly the biggest hypocrite among movie fiends everywhere and the evidence is in my voting history (I gave a two-score to The Graduate and I ranted at length about how the film sucked but I gave Risky Business a ten-score). There are very few films I actually despise that are probably good and many films I like that are utter bunk.  The Rules of Attraction is one movie I can't stand and I will not recant on that. Before any other users pass judgment on me, here are two redeeming factors that seperates this movie from excrutiating and unbearable.  As always, there maybe a spoiler or two here. 1) The cinematography, speed playback, and seperated screens that were used throughout Rules made it visually pretty. 2) I did laugh at the scene in the hotel where Dick and Paul were with their moms. It was so insanely inept I couldn't help but chuckle.And now for the list of misfires and spoilers are here too. 1) This film is just freaking gratuitous, nasty, and offensive. If Dr. Dobson watched this, he would blow a gasket and it would give him more ammunition against mainstream pop culture.  I don't necessarily blame him either. 2) The film wasn't driven enough by an actual plot.  If the plot involves the human connections via casual sex and swallowing coke, then it failed miserably. 3) The film didn't even hint at the fact that the setting was at a college at least in terms of the word. These characters never attended a single class, not one.  The last I heard about attending college, you needed to maintain a decent attendance in classes to be kept in the school but that is me.  4) Sean Bateman is a sadistic lowlife who needs to be put of his misery. I wanted the crack dealer to paint the wall with Bateman's brain. He sleeps with any girl he can find and dumps them for someone else. I didn't find his attraction to Lauren Hynde plausible at all. 5) I was utterly sick after the suicide scene.  Why was that such a pivotal moment in the film? Can anyone explain to me why we need to see a girl mutilate herself in a tub because she was passed over by a psychotic nutbar like Bateman? Are we so denied love that we have to take our own life to get attention?  Funny enough, Bateman didn't even notice that she did what she did. 6) To make it all the sicker, did we need to see one guy drivel and cry over another guy? I am squeamish when it comes to scenes when one guy hits on another guy and the second guy needs to defend his manhood through violence. It violates the principle of ""respect is key"" in my mind. 7) I think any faculty member at that college should want to have a rumble with Eric Stoltz's character. That sends a sickening message about college faculty using their power for sexual favors. I think anybody who does should reevaluate their career choices. 8) I hate movies that don't have a point that can be found even if it was meant to be pointless. I found Rules to be doubly pointless. If I couldn't find in this movie then how did other users and movie watchers find a point? I guess that is left for me to mull over.Two reasons give this movie a score of two. Some users found this praiseworthy but I found it to be gagworthy. I watched it with a group of friends and I guess we all suffered from a severe lapse in judgment.  This film ranks on my low list with the likes of American Psycho, The Graduate, and Tomcats. I stick with the reasons I hate those films and I will not recant on them. I am not going to read a Bret Easton Ellis novel either because I saw Psycho and Rules and the argument follows by inspection. As I said that hate this movie, I am being a hypocrite.  I loved Y Tu Mama Tambien, American Pie, and Risky Business and the subject matter in all these films are just as gratuitous and sickening. I loved all these films because they made points and had plots unlike the three I previously mentioned. They were just as sick and disturbing and would have made Dr. Dobson cry foul.

50,jbartelone,Would Be Better If We Cared About Characters,4,18 January 2007,"One of the biggest problems with The Rules of Attraction is absolutely no sense of any reason to care about the characters. They come across as little more than drug and sex-crazed objects, rather than people, as their lives change around them, sometimes with tragic results.Another problem is that rapid scene changes and bizarre camera effects DO NOT improve the story line in any way. Just as the viewer tries to get into a mood or feel for any of the characters in the story we get a scene change. Clearly Roger Avary is trying for creative camera work, as if this will improve the story, but it just makes The Rules of Attraction more of a mess of a mess.I was able to empathize with the sensitivity and compassion of the bi-sexual, Paul Denton, played very well by a young actor named Ian Somerhaulder. Paul however was the ONLY person who seemed to care about the other characters in the film. The other people are just so useless that there is no reason to care about them. The only other sort of decent highlight is a montage of a trip to Europe done with some decent camera work and narration by another good actor, Kip Pardue.However, stronger character development among the rest of the actors is non-existent and at times repulsive.

52,commandercool88,Darkly Perfect,10,30 March 2007,"For those who like their humor served with a side of cynicism and twisted laughs to wash it down with, 'The Rules of Attraction' is for you. From the author of 'American Psycho', it's yet another film you simply need to experience rather than read about. You just can't put in writing the biting tone that's captured so well in this great satire of relationships and society. But if you want to see me try, read on.The younger brother of Patrick Bateman (yes, the American Psycho), Sean Batemen (James Van Der Beek) attends Camden College where he deals drugs and sleeps with a new woman every night. Bateman's latest womanizing quest brings him to Lauren Hynde (Shannyn Sossamon), a virgin who's saving herself for the right person. This happens to be her boyfriend Victor, currently back-packing across Europe. So instead, Bateman hooks up with Lauren's roommate, Lara (Jessica Biel). Meanwhile, Paul Denton (Ian Somerhalder) is a provocative student who dated Lauren before coming out of the closet. Now, Paul's current object of affection is Sean, who is completely uninterested. The disruptive lives of these individuals and more will collide and cross paths in this deep, vast pool of misery.What separates a film like this from the other teenage sex comedies is how brutally realistic and honest it is. It doesn't use sex as its only weapon, but exerts social commentary while still earning savagely funny laughs at the same time. It understands its target audience, and instead of handing them another pre-packaged and clichéd sex romp, 'Attraction' caters to its audience by darkly satirizing the unrealistic world of many similar films. And so it is, in a way, 'American Pie' for higher thinkers, those who yearn for more substance.Props to Roger Avary for brilliantly directing and adapting the source material. He directs with a great sense of style that doesn't detract from the film, but only enhances and adds to this bold and innovative film. It dares to be so outrageous at times, it'll have you laughing out loud through the length of entire scenes. Other times, it's twisted sense of humor will leave you feeling guilty for laughing. But you have nothing to regret.'Rules of Attraction' is character driven from the very start. It relies so heavily on its disturbed characters, that a workable cast is detrimental. The people featured here are not people to admire, and they're not here to make the right choices in life. They're bad people who make bad decisions, and through their decisions the effects they have on other characters is explored. Avary squeezes every ounce of talent from his cast, who all seem deeply dedicated to their roles. And with James Van Der Beek and Jessica Biel coming from successful television shows with squeaky clean images, it's no surprise this film caused quite a stir. Both find themselves in a new environment, and both end up excelling. Yet the performance of the film comes from Ian Somerhalder, who helps provide the film's most outrageously funny scene (you'll know when you see it).'The Rules of Attraction' doesn't follow a set path. Its characters don't follow a certain stereotype. It's what helps make 'Attraction' such a great film, which begins with the end. It's a film of cause and effect, and from this opening scene, we work out way back to uncover how these characters ended up the way they did. It's not pretty, and it's certainly not uplifting. It's life. And life usually isn't very pretty nor uplifting. We drift, looking for answers and direction. We make choices. And those choices have consequences. There are no rules to 'Rules of Attraction'. But if there were, I wouldn't tell you. You'd have to watch it yourself to find out.",The Rules of Attraction

I finished it with the same question, where's the plot?  It only seems there were many vignettes of the lives of a bunch of nude, sex crazed, drunken college kids with a few moments of indisputable terribly foul language which left me wondering why I was even watching this excuse of filmdom. Take those ingredients out and there is little left. There were a few brilliant moments where things did make sense, like the indifferent love felt by Sean toward Larin.  The bi-guy Paul, played by Ian Someralder, was a pathetic character always trying to make out with straight fellows.  And Victor's, played by Kip Pardue, trip to Europe, was nothing to shout about.  Scenes running in reverse seemed to be a pet of the director, and became somewhat passe after a while, even to running the credits backward at the end of the movie.

55,evilmatt-3,"Funny, only so long as you are willing to admit you're laughing at yourself",8,6 May 2003,"Bret Easton Ellis is a fantastic writer.  The film adaptations come as no surprise; his book almost scream to be made into movies.  However, I have yet to see a single Ellis-book-inspired-film that actually has a clue as to what Ellis is really doing.  _The Rules of Attraction_, although a brilliant satire and overall good film, suffers from this same curse.Roger Avary (the director) constantly refers to this as a ""college film,"" stating the he remembers feeling this way ""back then."" No offense, Mr. Avary, but this is as much of a college film as _American Psycho_  was feminist literature.  (For those of you who say, ""Ah!  But it WAS feminist literature!"" I am sorry to say you have already missed the point.  Run along.)  The whole idea behind this film is that there are (like it or not) seemingly universal ""rules"" that govern how human beings approach relationships, and that those rules are extremely maladaptive.  The college setting makes the most sense for the theme (since for most it is the *real* beginning of sexual identity.)  Ellis' satire, though, cuts much deeper, to the heart of society (as it always does).Ellis' characters are crazy/funny/sexy but only inasmuch as we ourselves are crazy/funny/sexy.  This isn't meant to be an exhilarating film as much as it is an exercise in self-reflection.  Unfortunately, neither the director nor the targeted audience is aware of that.  When I've seen him interviewed, Ellis is smiling.  I have a feeling I know why: he likes to see satire in action, and that's what this film will give you.Technically, very nicely done.  Van Der Beek is good beyond belief.  The rest of the cast, largely unknown to me, was certainly adequate.  The camera work will be of great interest to some (e.g., the Sundance channel), but I personally found it the least interesting part of the movie given the morally complex story.If you're going to pick up this movie anyway, you'll no doubt like it, regardless of your reason for picking it up.  But please remember the entire time: ELLIS IS MAKING FUN OF YOU.",The Rules of Attraction
56,SILENCEikillyou,nothing there,4,15 April 2003,"Let me see... where to begin on such a hyped up waste of film.  There was nothing about this film to redeem it; other than, possibly the acting that wasn't grand or anything - though it passed.  The director possibly was asleep and wasn't giving any of the acting staff much substance to work with.  I mean c'mon... we know these people are better actors than that. We've seen 'em... maybe not GREAT, but they seemed to wonder where they were going with all this, all the time, and that's poor direction.Then lets tackle the jumbled up mess of a plot... nope, can't find one.  It was here, it was there, and there was no cohesion to bind it together.  Not one thing tied the acting crew to a focal point or goal.  Granted it was simply some stories of some drugged up college students who didn't know whether they were coming or going; but anyone can talk or write about that. And if it seems like my report has no direction, its because you can't lock on to one single thing about the plot to dissect.  There really was nothing in the plot to talk about.Again the acting:  It was simply good on all accounts.  Not one performance stood out and I blame the direction for that.  It was like they were all wondering where the director was.  I was sure I saw Jessica Biel look for the director in one of her scenes in the middle of the film.I HATE... simply HATE to trash a film.  THEREFORE, I'm adding this:  PERHAPS the directing staff and writers worked really really hard on this film and I (just me) didn't get it!  I'm a nobody, but in my opinion this movie just wasn't worth the money to rent it, for gladly, that's what I did; rather than spend the cash to see it in the theater.4 out of 10 thank you",The Rules of Attraction

Sean Bateman is a colorful character and worthy of being a sibling to the businesscard-obsessed Patrick. I haven't seen Killing Zoe yet, but I'd heard good things about Avary and after seeing this, I think he's reputation is justified. ROA starts off with a bang (especially the backwards moving photography is brilliant and captivating), but slows down to the last half hour.

58,Gjay2,not as shallow as it seems,8,28 March 2003,"the trailer makes it look like some shallow ""teen"" romp, about sex, drugs and well, more sex and drugs, but behind it's cold exterior lies a beating heart. Roger Avary has made the tightest film of the year, coming up roses with the visuals, the audio, the drama, everything. It all just seems to work. It looks snazzy, with the director using allsorts of trickery to make a scene ""look cool"" but it really, just clicks. The dialogue is like a drug induced american beauty. Funny and shocking, yet poetic, all at the same time. And the soundtrack just makes it all that little bit better.There are some scenes in the film that are hard to endure, testing us, to see what we can endure. Especially one scene, that really works on your emotions, causing us to see past the screen and ask ourselves ""do we really want to see this happening?"". But we do, well i did, and it is now a favourite ever scene of mine. Simply because it's so beautifully and tenderly done. James Van Der Beek enjoys ripping his dawson leary image with great glee. You can imagine him laughing himself silly as he wipes his backside on screen. And overall, he looks and does brilliant in his role.The film though, isn't for everyones taste, infact a few people walked out after about 20 minutes.

Because even though a part of me wants to believe that this isn't how good-looking rich kids treat each other, another part of me has to acknowledge that this is, that there are people out there who truly don't care about themselves enough to respect other people in relationships, sexual or otherwise, that we as a society still find it acceptable to portray gay men as ONLY sex-obsessed, self-deluded persons swooning over strait counterparts and that it's one of the only representations we have in popular or cult films/culture, especially in this one, and that the death of romance has not only been portrayed, but that it's been slaughtered in full-force.  Watching this film leaves you with a frozen kind of emptiness inside of you.  The reverse-sequences interspersed throughout the film, as annoying and tiring as they are, remind you how backwards and unhealthy these kind of lifestyles are- lifestyles that base relationships (seemingly) on lust only, that don't seem to appreciate friendships formed along the road, that continually define life as one big shopping list of bedmates.  I don't know...I hope the film is seen as a warning as to the disconnection and ultimately dissatisfying result being this way leads to.  It's kind of rare for me to become so negatively opinionated about a movie, but this movie just struck me in a very cold, unfeeling place.

62,Doogie D,"Dull, and hardly as provocative as the filmmakers must have hoped",3,17 October 2002,"I sat through RULES OF ATTRACTION and thought it was very, very poor. It's an adolescent idealization of sorts of college sexual experience, barely connected to reality. The characters are so unenlightened and, within the film, unmotivated, that it's really difficult to care; there are plenty of despicable characters in films out there which don't undermine sympathy toward the filmmakers' vision, so it's more than a bit disingenuous to argue that if someone doesn't like the movie in spite of its anti-heroes (ahem), that there's a generation gap or they're Missing The Point. Maybe folks who DO like this film are missing the point: there's a soggy symbolism at work in this movie (""Viktor: The test came back positive!"" everyone at the door fails to register), and a cheapness in motivation which undercuts any good will the movie almost gets going.  The girl's suicide is the result of myopic obsession, and we never noticed her because the film didn't either, until it's too late (and if that implies OMNISCIENT UNDERSTANDING or EMPATHY or TRAGEDY, then why are we spending so much time with the three leads?); people who are barely even introduced suddenly feel the world will come apart if their lust is unrequited; and the final stroke betraying the Lauren character as equally unaware as the rest of these folks is either a crime pulled on her character or a revelation that her performance wasn't so hot after all, since absolutely NOTHING pointed toward Lauren as delusional. Undoubtedly the film was supposed to be something of a bludgeoning sledgehammer, and instead it's more like being asked to watch as a second-year film student (I'll give Avary that much) performs with a moist towel.

The movie explores these characters via clever, exciting montages and by starting off at the end, showing where each character will wind up, then going back to the very beginning. It rarely ever bored me, and Roger Avary's entire ""style"" was what made it different from the same old crap Hollywood continues to bombard us with.

67,abyoussef,"""A hit-and-miss look at college life with moments of inspiration.""",7,8 October 2003,"by Dane YoussefRoger Avary's ""The Rules Of Attraction"" is a look at the ""expirementation"" of college life. Alcoholism, drug abuse, suicide and sexual escapades.That's not to say that the movie is all about--oh wait, it pretty much is. There are a few moments of outside ""experimentation,"" but it is mostly an orgy party. This is the kind of film Avary is best at. He showed this with his style and energy in movies like ""Killing Zoe"" and ""Pulp Fiction."" He's been gone for about a decade working on this and has claimed that the ""unfilmable"" novels by Brett Eastern Ellis (""American Psycho"" and ""Less Than Zero"") had been horrid adaptations because they strip Ellis'es storytelling style (told through accounts of multiple narrators giving their fuzzy testimonies).In this new film, Avary tries to get that confused feeling down with different style techniques: rewind, fast-foreword, split-screen and multiple narratives.It sometimes works and it sometimes doesn't. Perhaps this movie directed more like Christopher Nolan's ""Following"" and ""Memento"" and Steven Soderberg's ""Full Frontal"" instead of Fisher Steven's ""Just A Kiss.""The performances are incredibly strong, the best from James Van Der Beek (""Dawson's Creek,"" ""Varsity Blues"") playing the lecherous and sexually and nacrotically-charged Sean who's pastimes include anonymous sex and the use of every narcotic known to man. He has a creepy glare made famous from most Stanley Kubrick films and a sardonic and uncaring nature. An ""emotional vampire"" he calls himself.Shannyn Sossamon plays a college student who has eyes for her boyfriend, Victor (Kip Pardue) and is saving her virginity for him. She looks at gruesome books about STD's and other vaginal diseases to keep herself out of having sex. What Lauren doesn't know is that Victor is in Europe and perhaps having sex with with the entire Continent. He narrates a capsule summary of his incredible escapades and is one of the best sequences in the movie. Poor Lauren. She plans to lose her virginity to Victor, but as we see in the movie in the opening, that doesn't quite pan out.Ian Somerhalder, model and all-around pretty boy plays the now openly-gay Paul who has eyes for Sean and tries to get him to succumb to his side. In the original novel by Ellis, Sean is a bisexual who sleeps with Paul. In the film, the two are seen kissing and making out in Sean's room. But is it real or is it all in Paul's head? The split-screen makes it all so confusing.Jessica Biel (""7th Heaven"") plays Laura's promiscuous roommate who's libido is running non-stop and drug intake is piling up. She gets a nosebleed (""rusty pipes"") and sleeps with the men important to Lauren.Eric Stoltz, Faye Dunaway and Swoozie Kurtz play the only adults in the movie who are really no better than the kids. A bit of Mr. Avary's creative license kicks in here (Stoltz's foppish teacher, Mr. Lawson) was not in the original novel. He states he cannot deflower Ms. Hyde because he is married with children and she is an undergraduate. But oral doesn't count, right Mr. President?Avary's technique serves a purpose, especially with the opening's bungee-jumping narrative, as well as a split-screen shot approach showing how two characters on completely different paths walking along and minding their own business meet up at the same location. And once a character's shades come off, the shot completes--indicating love at first sight. Well-done.And the back-packing trip to Europe with the mysterious Victor who hosts and stars in this orgy of FF>.We somehow get inside the characters. Right into their heads in a way we did in ""Memento."" A more style like ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" and insider feel like ""Memento"" I think would have been a better approach.Still, Avary is a stylist first and foremost. He gave ""PF"" and ""KZ"" it's hyper-kinetic juice. So it's not a bad movie, not at all.The movie really means something. There is a substance inside and beneath all the style. And the substance abuse. Some felt the movie was too much like it's characters--empty, posh, glossy and confused callowness. But that is the world these people live in. Just the way it's made---they way Avary attempts to distinguish his own style of Ellis' style of narrative really makes it an innovative film. And I think we can all agree that at the end, it all kind of feels like life does make sense after all. There's a sad, painful sort of logic to it. And we see how a lot of the wealthy, trendy collegiate party-animal crowd aren't nessicary something to aspire to. Don't you feel a little better about your life?At the end, Sean is deep in thought about something. Something greater than what he just went through. Is there some hope for any of them? What are you think about after going through all of this? Meeting these people, their debauchery and contempt?

68,Xploitedyouth,Sickening,1,11 March 2006,"This is one of the ugliest films to come out in quite a while. It's not the sex, the drugs, the drinking, or even the palpable sense of immorality. It's the nihilism that ultimately renders the film unwatchable. How can people of this age, of these backgrounds, and of these obviously high level of intelligence be so goddamn jaded? I'm sure I'll be accused of making base generalizations, but these people have everything going for them, not a care in the world, and yet they still find reasons to be moody at best and downright reprehensible at worst. The main focal point of every characters' lives is sex, but none seem to enjoy it. They're not even keeping track of who they screw and when, so that rules out the trophy-seeking motive. At least one character (James Van Der Beek) is pursuing these carnal relations in a predatory sense. That explains the why, but doesn't excuse it. Another character (Shannyn Sossamyn) claims to be seeking love and saving her virginity, and seems to be fairly sharp, but still she associates with scum-of-the-earth frat boys who she knows will screw her and forget her name the following day. There's a void in logic that these characters seem to exist in, so the film is ultimately an excuse to watch despicable people doing despicable things to other despicable people. It's an endless chain of nihilism, narcissism and just plain bad taste.",The Rules of Attraction
69,droogiedim77,My favorite movie to come out this year.,10,1 November 2002,"Let me start of by saying that when I first heard about The Rules of Attraction, it was the only movie scheduled to come out on October 11th. In fact, it is my opinion that if the market wasn't flooded with new movies coming out on the same day then this film would have been more successful. I heard about Avary's troubles with the MPAA over the content of this film and the more I heard the more I needed to see this movie. I loved this movie, and am eagerly awaiting its release on dvd. Not only, I will still have to see this at least one more time before it leaves theatres. It's rare to find a film actually worth the $9 for admission. Rumor has it the original cut was around 150 minutes. For the people who didn't like this movie, there are two reasons why. One, being you heard ""American Psycho"" and assumed this would be the same and two, you don't understand the concept of satire. I almost died laughing while watching this film. It opens up disturbingly, but there aren't more than 2 or 3 truly disturbing moments in the film. The rest of the movie is laugh-out-loud funny. I also thought the film was done very stylishly. I loved the way Roger Avary used the narrative and where he chose to put his camera. Avary has a difficult task telling the story with essentially three narrators and three different viewpoints. He pulls it off without a hitch using motion-capture and an innovative use of split screen. The music is also a strong point in the film. The narration combined with the music help make the movie play seamlessly. He also gets strong performances from his cast. James Van Der Beek is so good his role as Sean that you forget this is the same person who has been Dawson on the Wb for the past few tears. Jessica Biel also does good to shed her wholesome image from 7th heaven. Shannyn Sossamon and Ian Somerhalder also turn in great performances. I haven't seen any of their other work, but for me I will always draw them back to their roles as Lauren and Paul. The other roles in the movie are mostly cameos. Although only in it for a few minutes, I loved Kate Bosworth's part in the film. Thomas Ian Nicholas is also great in the role. At first, I hadn't even recognized him. I'd place this movie in the top 3 for the best movies of the year (right with Insomnia and Mothman Prophecies) and put it right up with my favorite movies of all time.

70,aatx1154,Its Not Oscar-like but pretty good...,7,14 April 2004,"Roger Avary's film adaptation of the Brett Easton Ellis novel dealing with the life of several college students at a liberal arts college has a cast of solid young actors. Most recognizable James Van der Beek and Jessica Biel from the WB Network. The story exposes the shallow, selfish lives of all the characters and how big a deal perception or rather misconception of situations affects their lives. Each one consciously or unconsciously lives in denial or a fantasy world while at the same time dealing with real life situations. A pretty solid film that has some open ends left for the viewer.

71,Skeptic459,I am at the wrong university!,3,28 December 2003,"Bret Easton Ellis's novels are tough to adapt to film. This is because his themes of nihilism, emptiness and despair are not exactly cheery. In fact Ellis seems on a permanent downer. Maybe he needs therapy and prozac. Also his cold, removed style of writing further distances the reader from the characters. I remember even Tom Wolfe commenting on how coldly Ellis's novels are written.I have not read the book but I think this is not a very good movie. Main ly because there is no one to relate to. I mean I hated these characters, they are shallow and superficial. Everyone here is really annoying and I was cheering when James Van Der Beeks character was attempting to commit suicide.Because there are so many stars from bad television drama, it seems like Roger Avary is subverting their squeaky clean image by putting the characters in a totally dysfunctional world. In fact, it was just one more film that made me hate rich people. If rich Americans actually act in this venal manner, well they suck. To quote that awful punk band Good Charlotte 'if money is such a problem, I think we should rob them.'At Auckland University we have naked drinking horns every now and then. Much cheering takes place and there is no male person whose attention is not drawn to the bodies of those who are naked and female. Or for some, male. Imagine my surprise then, when at a party the male characters seem oblivious of the fact that there are naked woman running around. No red blooded male under 70 is this jaded. Is this what rich Americans do at university? What, do they then graduate onto doing reenactments of Eyes Wide Shut?Knowing Ellis this was probably meant to be a comedy of soughts. But his comedy is extremely harsh. Remember American Psycho, boy was that a hard book to read.There are good things about the film. Mainly the camera work. The shot where Van Der Beek and Shannyn Sossamon meet is really well done. I thought it was a good idea. The montage where where the backpacking boyfriend narrates his journey was also well done if a little to much like MTV. This also states more about the film than any other scene. All shallow aesthetics and no substance.This film has no brain and no heart. Its a horribly empty world of people that you would never want to meet. The problem with Ellis is that we are used to character arcs. The protagonists go on a journey and change. Normally for the better. Us, the viewer are use to people eventually finding some sought of redemption. Ellis never does this in his books. In fact, if anything, they get worse. The characters seem more like types than anything else. They wear their parts like cheap costumes from the salvation army. Van der Beek even sneers, see thats acting!I give this film a three drunken frat boyz out of 10 shallow cocaine snorting models. That scene at the start with the girl being vomited on. YUCK!!! Ellis is just so hard on his characters.",The Rules of Attraction
72,bodyshots80,Scary but true,9,16 October 2002,"The Rules of Attraction is an excellent movie, however not the best adaptation there could have been for the book.  The book is even more shallow, more bi, and more drug filled but that is what Bret Easton Ellis(writer of American Psycho)wanted.  The girls and guys slept with way more people, did so many more drugs, and lived off of candy bars.  Isn't that how college is?  I liked the movie and gave it a 9 just because it still is somewhat controversial and kept my attention, but it needed more of an edge.  Oh yeah, the girls are hot in it.

I'm going to hunt it down and buy it! The story is told out of order and in overlapping stories, similar to that of Pulp Fiction, Go!, Jackie Brown, Snatch, and Memento. Great stories, too, involving sex, drugs, and drinking. WOW, this was cool.This movie is so good it references other greats, such as Porky's and 21 Jump Street.James Van Der Beek has made a couple of really great movies now, he's definitely one to watch.I'm going to research other Roger Avary movies now.

So, I completly avoided the damn thing until today, when a friend of mind who i greatly respect the oppions of said he heard that it was really good and that we should rent, i decided ""what the hell, I'll give the thing a chance"" and I am so glad that i did. This film is a work of art, plain and simple. It is NOT making sex and drugs seem cool or fun or anything of the sort. This movie is a complete send off of the idea that young adults can have carefree sex with no side effects. People who say this movie is just a typical teen movie need to look a little closer at what is really going on: every sex scene in this film is shot to make sex as unapealing as possible, in fact, the only time i was less turned on by sex scenes was watching ""A Clockwork Orange"", it shows sex as being something that when you make it a big deal in your life, it will consume you and draw out any humanity you may have. People who were like me that haven't seen this film yet, people who think ""It's just going to be another waste of time"" should see this film, and i have a feeling that if you really pay attention, you will see this disturbing masterpiece for what it really is.",The Rules of Attraction

The movie goes on and on but it doesn't go anywhere.  Please stay away from this film.  I have to say that I like the camera work and the acting was okay.  But the plot is a total fiasco that just seems to go around loops.  Do I hate the film? Hate is almost a compliment.  Yes, the movie has a lot of topless girls; yes, it seems that all the characters in the film do some kind of drug and yes they seem to be in college...but from what I noticed they were more preoccupied about getting wasted and have sex than anything else.  Is college life like this? Of course not, but in a sense is part of the college life, but is not the entire story. Watch at your own risk.",The Rules of Attraction
76,miguelsanchez69,mediocre movie thats seriously depressing occasionally funny,6,20 April 2003,"First, let it be known I am not one of those people who watches the ""Dawson's Creek"" show but I still feel this film was very misrepresented in ad campaigns. It is the farthest thing on earth from a teen comedy and actually a pretty decent film. However, some folks might take issue with the time disjointure when the Point of View shifts from character to character (this is the films attempt to adapt Easton's epsitolary novel). I get a kick out of non-linear storytelling but I think it is overused in the movie. When the film first begins and we have a doublespeed ""rewind"" shot similar to the one in Memento. Also the type of non-linear  same instant, several POV storytelling this movie uses has been done a lot better in Run Lola Run, Go, and Lawless Heart. I thought the use of the split screen to show 2 characters walking towards each other was particularly ingenious. The script though has a problem - there are multiple plots going on and occasionally they get muddled when they appear to conflate multiple accounts in the same period of time. On the positive side - the acting in this movie's great with Van Der Beek brilliant as an ""emotional vampire""There's some non-cinematic problems I had with the movie - the characters are for the most part vile and unlikable. Everything truly bad in the movie happens to the only characters most audiences would probably detests least. Granted life isn't that fair either but this movie is major-league depressing. All in all, an interesting, somewhat flawed and very depressing character study thats sometimes muddled but generally interesting.",The Rules of Attraction
77,applehuntr,ONE OF THE BEST OF 2002!,10,25 October 2002,"2002 has been a slow year for movies, at least for me, and ""The Rules Of Attraction"" shines with brilliance in this mediocre year.
The Plot: College kids: get drunk, party, screw, get high, screw some more, party some more and don't go to class. This may not sound like much, but director Roger Avary has injected such life into it that the film flat-out sparkles. The camera work, the music, the acting (Shannyn Sossamon is the stand-out here with a delicate, great performance), EVERYTHING all fits together so nicely it is nothing short of invigorating. The film also, thank God, isn't pretensious or boring. It is a faithful adaptation of the book (right down to the mid-sentence ending) and Avary deserves endless praise for this underrrated, underacheiving (only 2.5 million opening weekend, ouch) film. Viewers have been rather love-it/hate-it with this movie and, again, the film deserves praise for invoking such strong feelings.
A great, funny, depressing, colorful, electrifying film. It is already one of my personal favorites. *****9/10*****",The Rules of Attraction
78,applehuntr,Brilliant- The Best Film of 2002,10,31 March 2003,"""The Rules of Attraction"" is a brilliant film from director Roger Avary, it went ignored in theaters and hopefully will find its following on video/DVD.The film could be classified as a black comedy, it is darkly funny, but the dramatic aspects are what work best, such as a haunting suicide scene or the beginning in which the 3 main characters Lauren, Paul and Sean are introduced. That scene also has elements of comedy in it, but it is at its strongest with Lauren, who after passing out wakes up to find herself being raped, and videotaped. The scene then freezes, and rewinds to tell the story of Paul, and so on. This is a fantastic editing technique, and it really hits home on repeated viewings after knowing the characters motivations. 
The acting is excellent, with the stand out being Shannyn Sossamon, if the film had only been more well received then she could of gotten the recognition she deserves for this great performance. James Van Der Beek bought himself a clean slate here, anyone who sees this film instantly forgets about Dawson's Creek and will accept him as a real actor. Ian Somerhalder is solid as the third main character Paul.
The supporting cast is memorable, from a trampy Jessica Biel to a pill popping Swoosie Kurtz, and they keep the film moving at a brisk pace. The film has a few minor flaws, but nothing big enough to take away from this experience.Roger Avary has created an excellent film, with a score by Tomandandy that is nothing short of genius, that is powerful, hilarious and tragic. A unique masterpiece.10/10",The Rules of Attraction
79,leftyguns2,Decadent Campus,4,2 March 2005,"This film is certainly not one of the better ones, of life on campus.The story itself is about a campus drug dealer in Vermont.Ma advise to all young people who want to live on campus is under no let your parents see this film. It shows the epitome of campus decadence, drug use, suicide, rampant sex, betrayal. The acting is at best mediocre, despite the appearance of beautiful actresses Jessica Biel. Shannyn Sossamon, and Kate Bosworth. All great actresses in their own right , but their talents wasted.The storyline itself is rather vague and obscured by what appeared to be a constant switching from one scene to the other, The film also suffered from what I saw as lack of in depth dialogue. To make matters worse none of the characters were sympathetic . All were stereotypically self centered, with little concern for others. No message or social commentary.Need a reason to see it , well it was entertaining from an almost comic point of view. Needless to say those beautiful actresses Biel, Sossamon, and Bosworth, make an otherwise morbid film worth watching.",The Rules of Attraction

Sean Bateman has so much depth behind him and I'm all about characters with depth.Roger Avery wasn't too experienced when he did Killing Zoe. But he has come a long way. The Rules of Attraction has nothing wrong with it. It's funny. It's sad. It's powerful. It's outrageous. It will send you on a roller coaster of emotions and when it's over you will want to stay on the roller coaster.No movie comes near the original story telling like this movie does. From the backwards cinematography to the multiple narrators, I had full focus the entire film. And even with all the focus I gave the movie, I still can't catch everything in one run. I have to watch this movie so many times to notice everything.This film should be in classes for people majoring in film. That's all I can say about that.",The Rules of Attraction
81,imyjr,Very Funny,8,12 October 2002,"This is a cleverly structured and brilliantly written movie. Victor's (Kip Pardue) narration of his European trip and its on-screen portrayal is a tour-de-force almost worth the price of admission. One-liners are fast and furious: some satiric, some ironic, all very funny. The three suicide attempts are funny in very different ways..... certainly the one involving Paul's friend is hilarious; the one that succeeds is truly pathetic, and highly ironic in its irrelevance: so much of the plot turns on the actions of this highly anonymous character... The acting is superb. Special kudos to Sam Russell, somebody I had never seen before, for a hilarious turn as a spoiled-rich-rebel-with-some-cause kid named Richard (who wants to be known as Dick), and to Eric Stolz in a cameo as a sleazy professor using fading charisma to get done by young coeds. Kip Pardue, Ian Somerhalder, James van der Beek and all the girls are great. If you take Dawson's Creek seriously, don't go to this movie. Otherwise, run..... you will be thoroughly amused.",The Rules of Attraction
82,Manji,I liked it...I liked it a lot. Rock n Roll!,9,19 October 2002,"THE RULES OF ATTRACTION is by far one of the most ambitious films that I've ever seen. I mean, just the fact that it's based on a Bret Easton Ellis novel already makes it ballsy. James Van Der Beek has officially killed his Dawson persona. I can't watch those WB commercials anymore without thinking `yo, that's the sicky younger bro of Patrick Bateman.' Ian Somerhalder and Shannyn Sossamon are so disgustingly talented that they steal every scene that they do without the Beek. And when the three are together in the same area.damn! It's like magic on acid and I loved it all. I figured that this flick would be focused completely on `Dawson as a bad guy' but I was pleasantly surprised by the weight which both Somerhalder and Sossamon brought to their roles. Those three young actors came to play ball and they hit a huge homerun.But, as is expected, many people just hate this film.The main reason why the haters are hating? Lack of likeable characters. That must really suck, to go to the movies and not find a character that is just like you. See, I go to the movies to watch other people get into interesting situations. I'm not looking for anybody to identify with because guess what? Nobody in movies are real people, they are simply actors portraying characters.Now, I know you typically think of characters as being those nutty people in the back of your classroom who make everyone crack up. Well, in movies characters are not real people, they are the creation of other human beings. Depending on the right actor, each character is given life that steps right out of the pages of the text. But that doesn't mean that you're supposed to instantly want to love them. Disconnect yourself from that greedy need to identify with someone and just appreciate who you are as a person. You didn't find anyone you could identify with in this movie? Then why are you upset? Do you wish that you were that pathetic or lost in life like the three main characters? Interesting.Furthermore, many people bash this movie because it lacks a plot. That's about the stupidest thing that I've ever heard. Follow me now.does your life have a plot? I know mine doesn't. I live in the real world and just try to make the best of it. THE RULES OF ATTRACTION is about life and what happens when there is no arc to follow. The characters in the film have no plans for the immediate future because they really don't see anything outside of the day-to-day scope. This is a snippet out of their aimless lives and it is done that way purposely to demonstrate a simple fact. LIFE IS THE RESULT OF THOSE MOMENTS THAT CHANGE YOU FOREVER. The events of the film have to be recognized as those things that are going to forever dictate how these characters live the rest of their lives. It's great that you as a viewer would hate this movie because nobody looks forward to the future but you have to be like Mr. Glass in UNBREAKABLE to understand what's going on in this movie. If there's someone like you who has everything already nice and planned out then logic dictates that there is someone on the opposite end of the spectrum. They are lives with no purpose.So, no lesson has been learned by RULES OF ATTRACTION. People just don't seem to get it because it doesn't conform to the typical flick about college-aged kids. Since Roger Avary won't do it then I'm just gonna come right out and apologize for the lack of Jason Biggs screwing pies, Stifler drinking semen, and Nadia being broadcast over the internet for your voyeuristic pleasure. If you were led to believe that this movie was going to be a cute gross out comedy, then maybe you should just stick to Gene's picks at your local vid store. I'm sure he's got plenty of Weekend At Bernie's sequels to make up for the Big Bad Avary's non-conformist films.For the rest of you daring people, please check out RULES OF ATTRACTION as soon as you can for something different. I've said too much already. Please, don't go into the movie with my perspective.just see it to gain your own. It's catharsis, this movie should make you appreciate your life.",The Rules of Attraction
83,Mercury-4,Brilliant,10,20 February 2003,"To me a movie is about textures.I see people talk about the message of a movie, the meaning the motive the social value.  Movies like 'Life as a House' that affirm our already existing pompous self-images.  Robin Williams movies that bore you to death but you know there's something Good and Noble and True there that you're supposed to get like eating your vegetables.  Ron Howard movies or things like 'Lovely and Amazing' where the heavy-handed Message might have just as well skipped the movie and given a lecture.And in all that something is lost.  The power of cinema to change comes only after the magic of cinema has done it's work;  worked that strange dark sorcery that only comes when the film takes you over by it's art.I can't think of a thing to say about this movie.  The film is loaded with messages for those who can hack seeing how shallow we really are.  But whether you can hack it or not, whether you can see it or not, this is one of the most brilliant movies you will probably ever see in your life.  Not because the message is better or worse.  It doesn't matter what one does, only how well one does it.  In cinema these are questions of visual impact, emotional resonance, virtual reality, tempo, texture, music and dialogue. And the way they can all work together to become greater than the sum of their parts.You will never see a better movie than this.  The dark sorcery that movies work is perfect here.",The Rules of Attraction
84,spazierganger,Don't believe the critics... or the God-awful trailer. This is a great film!,10,10 December 2002,"I think many of the problems this film had at the box-office (and with critics) were due to the marketing hack-job Lions Gate pulled prior to its release. Watching the trailer and TV ads, one would go into ""The Rules of Attraction"" expecting another one in a long line of a stupid teen sex comedies. I had the benefit of knowing a good deal about this film well before it came out, and knowing what writer/director Roger Avary was going for with his film. This film is not intended to be another ""American Pie,"" but rather, it is a satire of films like ""American Pie,"" and the totally unrealistic worlds of those films. And Avary pulls this off perfectly, and as far as I'm concerned, ""The Rules of Attraction"" is a work of sheer genius.A lot of people have complained about the characters. Are they likeable? For the most part, no, they're very bad people. But that doesn't mean they're not interesting to watch. Since the characters are so realistic, we can gain a lot from watching their actions and the subsequent effects of those actions. Avary's adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' book does a great job of showing that these are bad things the characters are doing. You do not at any time get the idea that Avary or Ellis endorse this behavior, but are showing it as a caution, hoping that people will think twice before acting like these characters. All this probably makes it sound like the film is depressing as hell. And in some ways, I suppose it is. But it's also very entertaining and darkly hilarious. I say ""darkly,"" because you sometimes feel guilty for laughing at such obviously atrocious actions, but you can't help it.This is a film that relies heavily on acting. With bad acting, the points Avary is trying to make would have been totally lost. Luckily, the cast more the pulls it off. James Van Der Beek manages to make you forget that Dawson guy he's so well known for. He really seems to understand the character of Sean Bateman, and is not afraid to go all the way with his portrayal of this morally bankrupt man. He and Shannyn Sossamon are the highlights of the film. Sossamon's Lauren is the closest thing to a sympathetic character in the film. She does some undeniably stupid things, but she is not a totally bad person, and there are times in the film when you're heart just breaks for her. Sossamon does a great job of capturing the many mixed emotions her character feels. Ian Somerhalder is also very good as the other lead character, the bisexual Paul Denton. Jessica Biel seems pretty vapid, but then again so is her character, so it works fine. Kip Pardue and Thomas Ian Nicholas are also good in their smaller roles. Russell Sams steals the couple scenes he's in as an old friend of Paul's. His scenes are easily the funniest in the movie.Now I must talk about the directing. Roger Avary has made ""The Rules of Attraction"" a very highly stylized film. But it is not, as is so often the case, style over substance. All of stylistic tricks, while technically impressive, also add a lot to the overall theme of the film. That, and the fact that he got great performances out of a cast made up largely of WB alumni make ""The Rules of Attraction"" one of the best directed films of 2002. It's a shame Avary won't get any recognition for his work since the film was unfairly trashed by critics and was a box office disaster. I'm looking forward to seeing more of his work. Hopefully more people will be exposed to his obvious talent the next time around. This is a very dark and realistic film, something not too common with the vast majority of Hollywood films and, as such, it will not be for everyone. The film blows away the myths about sex and college life that have been perpetuated by countless films before it. People have been offended by this movie. Good. You should be offended that there are actually people this shallow and devoid of feeling in the world (and there are... people like this do exist). I know I am. But that doesn't mean it's a bad film. Rather, ""The Rules of Attraction"" is a great film, made be a group of very talented individuals, that at once entertains you and makes you squirm in your seat. If the film wasn't as graphic as it is, it wouldn't work nearly as well. It's the realistic, unsanitized nature of the film that gets the point across. It's not for everyone, but if you can handle it, ""The Rules of Attraction"" is a highly rewarding experience. See it when it comes out on video, since it was long gone from theaters within a few weeks of its release.Rating: 10/10",The Rules of Attraction

The stranger throws up on her.  The rest of the movie shows us how her efforts to lose her virginity in a ""good way"" lead to this, and has subplots about the unsuccessful quest for love of other students.  The movie itself has a lot of gimmicks, including fall leaves jumping back on the trees and turning green again to bring us to the beginning of the semester. The performances aren't awful, and the filmmaking shows skill, too, which is why I didn't score it a ""1"".

86,Vanyel,Intriguing study of unrequited attraction,8,12 October 2002,"Rules of Attraction is basically a study of a chain of unrequited attraction/infatuation: Paul wants Sean wants Lauren wants Victor.  It's not the typical romantic comedy fantasy by a long shot, but is often funny and occasionally tragic.  What really sets this movie apart, however, is the stylistic aspects: for example, major segments are set apart from each other by running the film backwards to link over to the next segment.  One is tempted to wonder if the movie knows whether it's coming or going, but personally, I think it works quite well.  If you prefer Hollywood endings and don't like movies that don't just tell the story, you won't like this one.  But if you like experimental styles, you'll love it.",The Rules of Attraction

88,BrettC,Great Adaptation! Rules RULES!,10,12 October 2002,"I'm a big fan of Brett Easton Ellis, and RULES OF ATTRACTION captured the spirit of the book extremely well.  It's not 100% faithful in many respects (most notably in the toned down bisexuality of most of the characters) ; however, much like Sophia Coppola's surprisingly adroit adaption of THE VIRGIN SUICIDES the movie captures the mood and tone of the novel.  Great performances, great style, wonderful editing!  People are criticizing the movie for being shallow and hollow?  Um ... that is the point!  Pointless?  That is exactly what it means to be.  These are not characters you love in the normal sense, and the plot is not meant to be neatly wrapped up in an hour and a half.  Of course it's pretentious, but that is the pose!  I think it's perfect.  Why did these actors take the roles?  TO ACT!  They are all getting away from their clean television images, and stretching.  The movie tests your patience and smarts.

You will leave this movie not knowing how to think, except that you hate each and every character (except the girl who sent Van Der Beek love letters).  Many people have had a problem with the fact that you dont really care about what happens to the characters. What most people have failed to see, in my humble opinon, is that you are not supposed to care. That is somewhat the point of the film. This is a very nihilistic movie.Avery uses some very interesting tools in this movie, including split screen and reverse motion. The reverse motion is a very original and unique way to introduce the characters and Avery is very smart about knowing when to stop using certain camera tricks. About half way through the movie it goes into a sup plot about Sossamon's ""boyfriend"" (Kip Pardue) backpacking drug induced trip through Europe. It goes through about three months in Europe with out missing any event of any importance and it does it in about ten minutes. If you like strange and disturbing you will probably like this movie. While not as good, it is as weird and nihilistic as Clockwork Orange or Fight Club. 8/10",The Rules of Attraction
90,Reznik_T,"Disturbing, depressing and funny at the same time",8,23 November 2017,"This movie introduces three college students who, for various reasons, feel like they lost hope for a meaningful life, but try to hang on to the pleasures of existence, such as sex and drugs. One of the three seems completely irredeemable (he even calls himself an ""emotional vampire"", who ""feeds off of other people's real emotions""), but the other two still have some qualities that make them somewhat likable. We get a glimpse of how they see the world and people around them, and how none of their friends or family seem to lead a much more noble life than they do. If it sounds depressing, well it is, but if you're a person who at least went through times of hopelessness in the past, it might be something you can relate to; although the movie doesn't seem to offer any hope or solution. The book the movie is based on was written by Bret Easton Ellis, who also wrote American Psycho, and you can definitely see the similarities between the characters of the two films, as well as the themes. The highlights of the movie are the performances. James Van Der Beek, Shannyn Sossamon and Ian Somerhalder totally sell their characters; when you're watching them they don't seem like actors giving a performance, but actual people with complicated thoughts, feelings and desires. The camera work is also really good, it does a good job capturing the weirdness of the characters' state of mind. Besides that, the movie has some genuinely funny moments which mostly come from the over the top nature of some of the characters. I only recommend it if the description above sounds intriguing to you. If it doesn't, you probably won't like it. Rules of Attraction is a movie I like to revisit from time to time, for its unique tone and its relentlessness, and because it shows a part of the human experience that hardly any movies do, and does it in a way that is not only dark, but also entertaining.",The Rules of Attraction

So I saw this last night and I must say I wasn't disappointed because compared to other adaptions it was well done. First off, Roger Avary's direction was fantastic and much better than his direction for KILLING ZOE. I do agree with other IMDB users who say the film was pretentious. It was. Compared to the book the relationships in the film are pathetic. Yet, the acting was fantastic. Shannyn Sossamon totally surprised me with her acting as Lauren. I must admit every time I've read the book I pictured Lauren as the blonde ditz. But Sossamon's acting changed my view and she should be proud of that. Van Der Beek wasn't bad but I'm sure they could've found someone better to play Sean. The other surprising acting came from Kip Pardue who played Victor. Wow!",The Rules of Attraction

Even though the film trims a lot of information from the book, as in hefty character development and expanded relationships and situations, the film is actually filmed in a unique way.  I really liked the backwards sequences and the great soundtrack.  I also liked the cast selected to play the main group from the novel.Anybody interested in checking out the novel should read Ellis's ""Less Than Zero"" before reading ""Rules of Attraction.""

94,Mercader79,Dawson's Crack,8,12 October 2003,"In common with the decent 1987 Bret Easton Ellis novel, which like this, begins and ends mid-sentence and features a blank page as well as a chapter written entirely in French, this movie makes itself vulnerable to charges of pretension. The reversed film technique is certainly overused in the early scenes and the entire film is restless with a boundless energy and enthusiasm throughout which might wear out older members of the audience (see reviews in The Guardian/Observer).But any such concerns quickly dissipate. As an energetic, dynamic and memorable depiction of the hedonistic excesses and debauchery of a shallow drug-fuelled US college campus existence, Rules of Attraction, not only finally establishes former Tarantino collaborator Roger Avary as a formidable talent in his own right. It is also by a narrow margin (after the disappointing Less than Zero and Mary Harron's impressive American Psycho) the best Easton Ellis adaptation yet.A bizarre amalgam of Larry Clark's 'Kids' and 'Saved By the Bell: The College Years', Rules of Attraction even attempts to rob the audience of its collective innocence by presenting much loved teen stars of the recent past in situations even the most depraved viewer could never have imagined. Witness the American Pie regular Thomas Ian Nicholas being assaulted by an enraged narcotics dealer. Fred 'Kevin from The Wonder Years' Savage injecting heroin between his toes. And the sight of James Van Der Beek's hard, angst-ridden face as he angrily conquers a fellow student will give many Dawson's Creek fans nightmares for weeks to come.
Although updated to the early 21st century, Eighties musical classics are also used to powerful effect, never less so than during the heartbreaking scene featuring the usually cheesy 'Without You' once sung by Canadian banshee Celine Dion.There are many high points (no pun intended). Victor's (Kip Pardue's) Kerouac-esque condensed monologue of his drug and sex filled European tour is brilliantly realised on the screen. Russell Sams' entire performance as the Jack Daniels-loving, and keenly homosexual 'Dick' is a comic master class.",The Rules of Attraction

Too many people like their movies to wrap everything up at the end and have everything explained to them and for Lassie to save the day. If you are one of these people then don't bother. On the other hand if you like a movie to challenge you then I am sure you will find ROA superb.Based on the book of the same name by Bret Easton Ellis it is probably THE best book to film adaptation I have ever seen. It captures Ellis' tone perfectly. Take some morally corrupt but beautiful people and show how much of a waste they are. Nobody ever listens to one another and everybody is out for number one. They are all selfish, greedy, and self centred. You are given not one character to like. It is a dark dark comedy about the corruption of excess and moral vacuum left behind. It is in my humble opinion brilliant. You will physically feel that vacuum in your stomach after watching the movie. These people and their actions are the perfect allegory for our ME culture. One significant difference from the book is the timeline which is updated to more current times from the books 80's context.Roger Ebert went to see this twice because he was unsure how he felt about it. In the end he felt it was too unrealistic with regard to the nudity and attitude to it and he couldn't reconcile with the fact that there was no one to like in it. In response he received many letters from students saying that this is exactly how it is on campuses in the US, that this is what they do every weekend. That might give you an indication of the level of reality achieved here and also an idea of the culture gap. This is another movie where older people may just not get it. When I read Ebert's review his main criticism's centred on the characters but personally I found myself throughout the movie saying for almost all characters `I know someone like that'.Go see it, but be prepared to feel nothing. It's decadent. It's great!P.S. I haven't read the other reviews but if you are silly enough to compare this to American Pie or such nonsense then you are WAAAAAY off the mark.",The Rules of Attraction

97,Pangborne,Why I like RULES OF ATTRACTION,10,5 June 2003,"I've read a lot of bizarre stuff about this movie, even from people who liked it, so I thought I would weigh in with my two cents. First of all, full disclosure, I went to a college very much like the one depicted in this movie, and every character was a grim reminder of what those years - and those people - were like. More importantly, this movie IS NOT, AND NEVER HAS BEEN, AND NEVER WILL BE, A COMEDY. It is a darkly disturbing drama that has a few funny moments. If any of the marketing seemed comedic, then blame the marketing people. I was stunned to read a review that treated the opening - in which a virgin girl is raped while passed out, and even vomited upon - as funny. It isn't and isn't meant to be. It is a slap in the face, and the look of sick horror in Shannyn Sossamon's eyes makes that frighteningly clear. The two sequences that follow - introducing us to the two other main characters - deliberately establish these ""heroes"" as morally bankrupt. It is visible in their eyes, and the camerawork deliberately makes them appear diabolical - a low-down evil leer is a motif in the movie throughout. The fact one of the characters starts to lose his erection during sex - when have you ever seen that in a American movie? - should be a heads up that this is not a comedy. Now there is a funny segment about in the middle in which Faye Dunaway and Swoosie Kurtz appear briefly and memorably, but the tone throughout is outrage and despair. Outrage that life like this goes on, and despair at how common it really is. Some people have described the movie as bleak, but it seems unmistakable that the main characters are desperately trying to climb out of the morass their lives have become, and that is why it grows to such a powerful ending. My advice to anyone watching THE RULES OF ATTRACTION for the first time is think of movies like HAPPINESS and YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS, and remember the original novel was written by the man who wrote AMERICAN PSYCHO. THE RULES OF ATTRACTION is an emotional slasher flick.",The Rules of Attraction
98,sideburnmikeguitar,boo hoo this movie is mean. It hurts my feelings,8,13 July 2007,"I read a bunch of comments on here about how mean it is, and dark and all that. It's either that or the complaints about it not being like the book. Who cares? It was effective as a movie. It wasn't perfect but deserves a fair criticism for what it was.Most of the characters are pretty flat throughout and don't really develop much. It reeks of nihilism in some parts and is a pretty good commentary on the darker side of selfish college kids who tend to actually BE that way in my experience. They all have these silly little illusions about what it should be...That is not to say it's like this for everyone. It's not. But for almost endlessly delusional, shallow people it IS like this. They compromise and hurt each other and themselves. The dose of reality involving the insights into Victor alone make this movie worth watching when you compare it to the girl that's been waiting for him. Awesome!! The characters hurt each other and only care about themselves. It's just portrayed in a really creative way.There's a moving suicide scene and it's cast pretty well. The guy playing Paul does a good job too. REally the only complaints I have about it is that it could've taken the concept of dark humor much further by having a few parallels of ""normal"" couples who treat each other like real human beings. It would've added a positivity that IS realistic and when juxtaposed with the morons these actors portray it would've been even funnier. I have no sympathy for anyone in the film, but at times it hurts a little to see them treat each other this way.Oh, and the editing/rewind trick wasn't that intrusive. It's just a devise to set up the scenes. One of the few dark comedy's that seemed pretty satisfying if not all that funny.",The Rules of Attraction
99,heather1252,Distraction rules,2,18 October 2002,"This film wanted to be an artsy version of an artsy novel but fails completely. With a structure that is exactly like that of ""Pulp Fiction"", the director wants the viewer to believe something deep is being shown and experienced. Unfortunately, the narrative strategy remains only a gimmick, an artifice that sinks rather than elevate the film. It adds to its inconsequential character. Despite some excellent performances by Van der Beek and Sossamon, their efforts are wasted as the plot meanders with the characters becoming less and less involving. By the middle of the film, it doesn't matter what happens to any of them. Furthermore, it engages in some ugly racist stereotypes like a pair of Hispanic and Black dealers, demeaning stock characters whom we have seen a zillion times before in much better ""Hollywood"" productions.

American Psycho portraits a sick man in a sick society. To do this on the screen the satire / comedy genre was and is the best choice.In Rules Avarys has taken the book almost to its word. In order to do this the technique of rewinding etc. is brilliantly chosen and well carried out. However it's to excessive!

This was not the case for American Psycho, and for this reason the latter worked well.That Avary did not contribute to the story or structure of Ellis' book makes me wonder who really did the biggest part of Pulp Fiction, Tarantino or Avary - my bet is Tarantino.For technique fans and the movie craving people I give this 8, however - rated overall it cant be given more then 6.",The Rules of Attraction

It shows what is wrong when these little babies go off to the ivory tower academic world and are given no real direction or focus from their supposedly more knowing professors and parents, who are actually more screwed up than the children are. It is a cautionary tale for parents and other adults who might have to deal with these spoiled losers later on in life. These are the people who anyone with a brain hopes will overdose before they graduate.These people have advantages they don't deserve or use to the best effect.The film is competently made with a few artsy, mostly fartsy storytelling devices.

Gotta say that I rank it as my second favorite movie ever, behind Pulp Fiction.The film is like an even more perverse version of The World According to Garp, with strong performances all around, especially by bit players. While some say that ""Dick"" steals the show, I personally prefer Fred Savage's appearance and the Food Service Girl is fantastic. But James V and Shannyn are good while Ian Somerhalder is pretty amazing. I can't think of one performance that wasn't at least good.The dialogue is strong, the first half of the movie to two-thirds is incredibly funny while building to a very sad, very real (despite the ridiculous situations that lead up to it) finale.

106,Krasnoludek,Pretentious Trash,4,24 May 2004,"Pretentious piece of trash about the lives of several college students. One's a drug dealer, another is a gay guy who has a knack for going after straight guys, and lastly is a girl trying to lose her virginity but struggling with the desire to make it special. The result: a movie filled with rich 20-somethings getting drunk, getting high, and having lots of sex. There's no real storyline, just fancy directing techniques like reverse filming which provide the segues between some scenes. Most of the interactions involve the characters waxing poetically about their lives and their meaningless relationships. Any of the ""love"" the characters have comes off as completely artificial, and you can't be sympathetic to anyone's plight. However, I wouldn't say there are any antiheros either, just boring ambling people who don't know what to do with themselves other than do drugs and have sex. Their crises are trite and the script is full of wordy diatribes that amount to nothing.The performances are overall rather bad, with a few shining through the muck: Sossamon delivers a pretty solid character, and Somerhalder presents the most sympathetic character out of the bunch (though I may just be saying that because I thought he was incredibly good looking). Van der Beek was a slight miscast, however the worst cast was Collins Jr as the drug dealer--completely unconvincing. Ultimately though, the movie suffered from a poor script and a director who thinks too highly of the artistic quality of his direction. 4/10",The Rules of Attraction

Regretfully I say that this was the worst part of the movie. It's so time-wasting to watch the same scene 3 times for three different characters. He could've made it as a direct cut with references that show that these events happened at the same time.

There is something about this tale of students at a privileged college who major in sex and drugs that reflects a part of our society that we don't want to admit is real but can't deny it either. College students and those under 40 will find the relatability factor is what captures their attention.Portrayals of troubled people always make good drama because the intensity level is constantly high and there is no happy ending. With Rules of Attraction, the main difference is that there is no real beginning. It is similar to Pulp Fiction in this manner. The plot shows what lead to what is shown at the beginning.

The story centres around a bizarre love triangle: drug dealer questions but continues his beergoggle promiscuity, bisexual prettyboy fancies drug dealer, drug dealer's (virgin) female love interest finds drugdealer servicing her roommate.One redeeming feature comes late on - a fast-forward monologue describing a bitplayer richkid's arrogant, seed-sowing jaunt through the bedsits, brothels and headshops of backpacker Europe: a Grand Tour subverted.

If there is any comedy, it's in the authentic absurdity of a given situation, not in a crude punchline or pratfall.

Rules of Attraction is that movie.  Chronicling a year in a college populated by well-off children, the film focuses on four kids (Somerhalder, a poor man's Wes Bentley, Sossaman, the one decent thing in the movie, Van Der Beek and Biel, both in ""my mom thinks I'm edgy"" performances) who have little interest in anything outside of sex, drugs and rock and roll.All these characters are about as vile as can be.  Perhaps the film would've been better if a serial killer had walked in in the beginning and shot all of them in the head twice, making sure there was no chance of them perpetuating this trash.  The characters are not much more than stockpiles of the worst in every human being.  The hypocritical, the sadistic and the corrupt.  One time we see a sympathetic character, but this one dies soon after we meet.  Lucky her, anything to get out of this movie.It's hard to believe that Avary, who co-wrote one of the best movies of the last decade, Pulp Fiction, would be stooping to such an amateurish effort. The camera work and effects come off as something that an over eager film student that discovered these techniques would use (""Hey let's use backwards motion through the whole movie, it's brilliant!""  ""Oh no it's not"".)  The opening scene over does backward filming that at one point you're left thinking ""Enough of this, let's start the movie!""  If you don't wish the movie to go ahead, you just wonder what these techniques have to do with anything.  The script that some consider as brilliant satire on wasted youth I see as not much more than sour grapes from the filmmakers, who apparently didn't get anywhere near as much sex as the four protagonists did in college.  Even as a satire, it isn't funny, at all.  The story leaves nothing but ugly impressions with very little incentive to keep you watching, aside to see just how absurd and befuddling the plot twists are.",The Rules of Attraction
128,mgbesq,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible",1,11 October 2002,"I absolutely hated this movie.  From beginning to end, it was the epitome of all things that are loathesome about the movies in this day and age. Based on the Bret Easton Ellis novel of the same name, 'The Rules of Attraction' follows the lives of a handful of well-to-do college students over the course of one (presumably typical) semester.  Along the way our characters do boatloads of drugs, have sex with the entire cast, and pontificate just ""what it all means.""Wait a minute: Are you telling me that endless money, drugs and even hot teen-idol sex won't make you happy on the inside?  Geez Mr. Cleaver, I never thought about it like that.Apparently that seems to be the crux of Ellis' thematic existence.  'Less Than Zero?'  Oh yeah, that was the one about rich youth run wild with orgiastic sex and drugs.  'American Psycho?'  Greed, faceless sex drugs and violence amongst - you guessed it - the young and rich (stock brokers this time.  Ah Hah!).  I can't decide whether or not Ellis envies or condemns his characters, but it can't be both at the same time.  Someone either needs to give him the opportunity to do bumps of coke off of a cheerleader's breasts while he gets sodomized by some sensitive art student, or forgive him for having done it in the past.  Maybe then we'll be free of this patronistic garbage.As for the rest of the film,  hack director Roger Avery does his best ""bull in a China shop"" impersonation, utilizing every camera gimmick...er...technique at his disposal; further proving that the worst part of Tarantino's rise to fame wasn't the endless 'Pulp Fiction' rip-offs, but rather the dismal resulting careers he started for his friends.  The whole movie smacks of such counter-stereotype that it actually becomes quite typical.  Look!  It's respected actress Lauren Hutton popping pills with Swoozie Kurtz!  Shocking!  There's those goodie-two-shoes actors from nice TV shows like Dawson's Creek, 7th Heaven, and the Wonder Years taking drugs and having sex and saying ""the F-word"" a lot.  Ooooooh.  I know, I know, it boggles the mind that any actor would take this kind of risky role, right? Whatever.  Why does EVERYONE decide to do this kind of thing and act as if they're the first ones to do it, like this is the way to build a well-rounded career?  Remember that one time when Jimmy Stewart played a whore-slapping pimp?  No.  Remember when Audrey Hepburn did that threesome scene and then killed everyone with her stiletto heels?  Not really.To cap all of this off (the ""rebellious"" casting, the film-student-style obsessive camera tricks) director Avery then jams the soundtrack full of hip, retro 80's nostalgia (thanks again, Quentin!).  However, Avery uses these songs to state the mood of the scenes rather than compliment them. Hey Mr. Avery:  It's YOUR job - not the Cure, Erasure, and P.I.L.'s - to make me understand your character's feelings and motivations. Normally a competent director and screenwriter would do this through a symbiosis of character development and deft camera work. But, if you lack these abilities, just pick a song that everyone in your target demographic danced to at their prom and thus already can make an emotional attachment.'The Rules of Attraction' is lowest-common-denominator film making at its gutteral worst.

129,calliope25,fascinating and disturbing,8,15 July 2006,"I rented this movie not really knowing what to expect, but having heard a lot about it figured it would be worth checking out. And I was blown away. First of all, who knew Dawson (er, James Van Der Beek) could act so well? I remember hearing part of the reason he took this role was specifically to get away from the good-boy image he'd developed from Dawson's Creek, and he did so beautifully. He was barely recognizable. I was very, very impressed by his performance.The movie itself was chilling - it reminded me quite a lot of Kids, but I found it slightly more relevant; that is to say, I have a feeling this movie reflects the real lives of more people than Kids did. I happened to go to a school a lot like Camden College; we even had an annual party almost exactly like the ""dress to have sex"" party shown here. So although I didn't participate much in that social scene, I was definitely exposed to it frequently and I can say that this movie is frighteningly based in reality. It struck very close to home. So, overall, although I can't say I actually enjoyed it, I thought it was extremely well-done and incredibly true to life.

130,Classybird,Absolutely awful,3,10 October 2002,"I was very much looking forward to seeing this film, and was extremely disappointed.Pretentious and self indulgent, the character development and plotline construction within the film seem to be far less important than the use of flashy stylistic techniques.  A particular 'motif' that runs through the film is the use of running the film backward.  Initally it is used extremely effectively and was an excellent way of introducing the main protagonists. However this style is overused and merely becomes a gimmick.  The characters become two dimensional cardboard cut outs, with little to explain the motivation behind their behaviour and the dynamics of their relationships with others.  The film is very misogynistic and is led by a character whose self loathing is only matching by his contempt for women.  The only woman he has any respect for and falls in love with is in fact a virgin.  He loves and covets her because he sees her as 'pure'Despite this on the whole the performances are good.  James Van Der Beeck slightly overdoes the cynical antihero, whilst Shannyn Sossamon is excellent, bringing sweetness and sadness to her character who is essentially very naive - so naive that she is raped but doesn't seem to realise!This film is extrmely flawed and falls way short of the mark.

It worked great on American Beauty, as well as Fight Club once it got out of the monotone, and American Psycho, sortof. But voice-over nearly destroyed the end of SE7EN, one of my favorite movies, by being completely out of place... then there was The Virgin Suicides and now this, Fools of Attraction, in which voice-over was used instead of script and plot to advance the story. *I* could have filmed the ending bike ride without the voice over, depicting the ever-increasing speed that was narrated... and I've never even held a camcorder.The only character I even remotely cared about was the food-service girl, because of how she passed by unnoticed until it was too late. And ok, Paul was funny, sortof...Now, I went into this knowing absolutely nothing about this movie, the writer, nothing; they could have at least made more of the idea that Sean was American Psycho's brother... I was supposed to get that out of one ""Patrick"" reference, with ""Bateman"" being a relatively common name? One person commented that the dinner/bedroom scene was a riot... I just wondered why ""Dick"" was trying so hard to be Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden. The echoes of Fight Club were so crass I could hardly notice anything else. Lauren had a toned-down Marla Singer haircut, and even held her cigarette like Marla... The rest of these spoiled rich kids just bored me.I can hear you now - you're right, I haven't read the book, but from other reviews I think I'm glad I wasn't able to be even more disappointed by the movie.

These seemed to distract from the fact that there was very little to care about going on in the film. Everything was exaggerated to the point of frustration. And the little ""ambiguity"" trick at the end? By that time no one cared what he was gonna say anyway so it was totally ineffective.

Cast a bunch of bad actors who should be in romantic comedies and not in this wannabe art of a filmI think you get the point. I think this film thought it was going to be some brilliant masterpiece and in reality in was just a boring hateable movie. I heard the book is much better (which I hear from every film and sick of hearing it) but apparently the director changed a few stuff. But I don't think anybody cares or would like this film but apparently some people do. Why? Cause they think it makes them smart if the like it?

135,marioreturns,Who can dislike a movie where everything flows moves backwards!!,10,10 December 2018,"I originally did a review for this movie years ago but decided to delete it for complicated reasons. I have finally decided to re-review it and add my new thoughts on it:The actors/actresses are great, especially Sossamon and Van Der Beek. Secondary characters, or even bit roles (like Fred Savage----""I can FEEL MY DICK!""---LOL) are awesome.Unknown Theresa Wayman (co-band player with Sossamon on her band) is simply stunning/remarkable in her brief, basically non-speaking scenes as Cafeteria Girl (named Mary in the book)---and her suicide scene is one of the most emotional, devastating, unforgettable moments in movie history you will ever see.In a way, she is the heart of the movie. Not in every way, but in a way. The movie is really, to paraphrase the late Roger Ebert's long-ago review of this movie, a well made movie about reprehensible people. And who should wonder? Van Der Beek's character is the brother of THE Patrick Bateman (AMERICAN PSYCHO)!!.Great score-----the introductory scenes featuring the Prelude to the opera AIDA are particularly effective.The movie's special effects of people running backwards and time likewise running backwards is also masterful and unforgettable (and just plain cool).Special mention must be made of Eric Stoltz in a brief but memorable role as the typical sleazy, pot-smoking, womanizing, Liberal Arts College Professor-----and of Faye Dunaway and Swoozie Kurtz, lending their experienced, artful hands as the drunken mothers of two-out-of-control, spoiled gay rich-brat sons (expertly played as well by Ian Somerhalder of Vampire Diaries fame and Russell Sams). Sams's character is especially memorable-----he refuses to be called Richard but only ""DIIIIIIIIICCCCK."" LOL.The ending ends like the beginning.....cut off in mid-sentence.The line Sossamon utters to Somerhalder at the end-----""It wouldn't have mattered to people like us,"" is unforgettable and haunting.The music on the closing credits is superb----I especially liked ""Stop!"" by Erasure---played after the final scene.A masterpiece---and future fodder for film theory and movie history professors to pore over. Plus, everything runs backwards!! What more do you want?10 out of 10.",The Rules of Attraction
136,Mr-Brightside,An admirable take on a truly mind-blowing novel.,8,20 June 2007,"I'm a huge fan of the book and think this was a movie that was pulled off superbly. Bret Eastern-Ellis, the author of the book, who's pieces tend to focus primarily around characterisation as opposed to deeply profound/complex plots, wouldn't be disappointed with the way in which Avery has adapted his initial vision and given each character a journey worthy of the big screen. It's in his (Ellis') characters and the emotional and interpersonal journey they embark upon that drives his narratives and it's that that tends to stick in the mind. This is the prime reason readers have tended to find it easy, as opposed to taboo, to fall in love with such unsympathetic characters, and it is in this task that the actors take to admirably. In fact, I'll go as far as to say the acting was great; James Van der beak put in a superb turn as Seam Bateman, Shannon Sossamon, although not a perfect adaptation of the Lauren character (she was much more unlikable in the novel) was as charming and as magnetic as ever and Ian Somerhalder as Paul, has never looked so comfortable in a role, the guy was great. It was also very, very nice to see a film in which you could sense, just by watching the way in which the film was executed, that the director was extremely dedicated to what it was he was trying to convey. To me Avery worked wonders to pull off what was essentially being marketed as a teen flick in such an unapologetic, cynical, and dark manner. He never strayed too far from the purpose of the plot and rarely sold out to the temptation of cliché, which was a relief.The film, as a stand alone piece is excellent, but as a companion piece it moves to another level, as the book allows the holes the film leaves to be filled properly. And whilst there was things about the film that weren't perfect there were any things that were so far beyond perfection I often wonder whether Avery didn't actually write the novel himself. For instance, the use of the re-wind effect. It wasn't merely laid on haphazardly as some ""cool"" MTV style effect to wow the audiences, and it wasn't layered upon the scenes in order to portray subtlety, which if you'd watched the film, read the book and understood the characters at all you'd know that the film and the trilogy of books in general are anything but subtle. The purpose of the re-wind was to simply put forth the idea that the story was not your conventional linearly told story with an established beginning, middle or end, it was put in place to simply drive the idea that the story is a multi-faceted tale told irrespective of time and or space. The re-wind simply sold the idea that it was moving backwards in time and was unapologetic about doing so, hence the lack of tact in putting forth that particular aspect of the narrative. It was a brilliant use of a basic cinematic tool by Avery nd one that confirmed to me just how passionate Avery was in doing proper justice to the novel, even if production tried to force him into creating a run-of-the-mill, archetypal teen drama, something Rules, was never meant to be.I love how he film, much like the book, starts and ends mid-sentence too. It's a ploy that really shouldn't work (and has confused some of the more intellectually challenged people I know) but it does, and to devastatingly good effect too. The opportunity for interpretation is vast because of it, and any film, or indeed book, that evokes the level of thought this one does is doing its job well.In comparison to the novel, which tends to take emphasis away from character empathy and sympathy and focus far more on what it is that makes them the way they are and develops the characters, their relationships with one another and their general plots in far more detail, the film could ever have really accomplish this and tends to brush over some of the more fleeting issues of the original texts. A frustrating gripe, but totally understandable. No slight on Roger Avery's vision, of course, but with the constraints than a Hollywood production provide it would have been nigh on impossible for Avery to not only entertain adequately and match the general expectations the audience have of a film of this ilk, it would also have been unlikely that he'd have the runtime available to him in order to extract every ounce of detail from the original text.The book is much darker than the film and due to it's crude and overtly descriptive nature leaves little to the imagination; the film, whilst morbid in a lot of places encompasses humour and leaves a lot of scenes open to interpretation, which is an element of the film that I did enjoy. Not sure I preferred it, but I did enjoy it.Whilst I prefer the book I still see the two pieces as two almost faultless productions, and both should certainly be enjoyed.",The Rules of Attraction

I'd was hoping for Tim Burton's American Pie, but instead ended up seeing a complete mess.  While I'm a big fan of the work Roger Avary has been attached to previously, (Killing Zoe, Pulp Fiction) this movie just comes off as an unorganized attempt at making another college movie.  Avary attempts making artistic statements by running the film backwards at various points in the movie but it gets tired after the third time.  And how many times do you plan on showing an ""evil"" James Van Der Beek with his chin slanted towards his chest and the camera viewing him from above?!?  *Yawn*  Rather than focus on some type of theme, the script just crams as much drugs, sex and violence into the shortest amount of time without any regard to the plot.

Yeah I know there in college whatever but its like they were trying to say that all young adults are stupid, horny, sex craze, idiots that have random mood swings.

However, his second film, and the one I am ""commenting"" on right now will NEVER make it into my collection. Rules of Attraction is just plain bad. It's obvious that this college party-hardy film was conceived out of the minds of two horny testosterone filled men named Roger Avary and Bret Easton Ellis (the man responsible for writing the novel). I mean, when you see gay men being tossed around by straight men and indirectly being made fun of, a drunken virgin being sexually taken advantage of, a beautiful blonde being gang banged by the football team, and countless young beautiful ""easy"" college girls getting naked you just know something is not quite right.
As much as this film tries to have a heart, it just simply doesn't. Most of the characters are cold jerks who are either looking for sex, drugs, or beer. They get plenty of it too. Half the time the characters are drunk, high or just being stupid so I really didn't get a good sense of who these people are. The film and the characters have the depth of a bottle cap, and the feeble attempt to add depth to the film with a suicide was laughable. Melodrama at its worst. I'm not sure about this films budget, but it must have been somewhat low considering that most of the college parties with grandiose names like ""Edge of the World"", and ""End of the World"" looked like high school house parties with around 50 people in attendance. Couldn't get enough extras? Too bad, looks like you tried to bite off more than you can chew and it showed.
What I did like about the film is the technical aspects like camera work, lighting, editing, and sound, but not even those things could save the film from its dreadful characters and plot.

Based on a novel by Bret Easton Ellis who has also brought us American Psycho and Less Than Zero, the film explores college life at a liberal arts university in a rather honest way. Lets just say don't take your mother to see this flick. Van Der Beek pulled the role off quite well as the drug dealing college student who's tired of sleeping around and wants nothing more than to fall in love. The cinematography was interesting and the plot line was unique. There are quite a few humorous scenes although I wouldn't consider this movie to be a comedy in the popular sense. The film has that weird feel to it much the way Pulp Fiction did( who Roger Avary, the writer and director of this film also co-wrote).

146,Ben-209,The best Ellis adaptation,8,1 April 2003,"Not shocking any more, of course, there are so many films like this about. Posh college kids going off the rails, sex drugs blah blah. However this is a film with much to recommend it. You will not like it if you insist on a 'story'. The film is too diffuse and bitty to have any linear plot. All you really are seeing is fragment of American college life as told by several participants, the main one being Sean Bateman who is not a nice guy. But despite the fact that these middle class kids are so appalling, you do feel something for them, and in fact if you bother to pay attention, some of the characters go through something of a transformation during the film, Bateman in particular. Unfortunately no single character, including Bateman, has enough screen time to give us a detailed enough look at their journey, so the pace seems a little forced. The downfall of the film, which makes it merely good not great, is that it can't seem to strike a balance between its 'Short Cuts'-esque tableaux and the need to tell a story. Thus the different bits are fun, they are often hilarious in fact, and are very well shot and performed. James ven der whatsit is, surprisingly, very good indeed and there is not even the faintest whiff of Dawson to his performance.

After reading the review which explains how toned down the movie was from the book, I understand.  To be frank, they should've left Sean as a true jerk, Paul and Sean's sexlife, and Lauren's non-virginity.  I have a feeling it would have been much better.

148,crodog5342,A far from perfect film.,10,17 April 2006,"So, why the perfect rating? To get past the negatives at the outset: the plot could be considered sensational with its arguably gratuitous portrayal of drugs, sex and violence. The cinematography ranges from gimmicky with the reverse photography to derivative with the Scorsese knock-off split-screen action. Finally the characters are either deplorable or pathetic. Having recognized its flaws however subjective, from a personal stand point, I have never seen another movie that so accurately captured the nihilism and malaise of a particular period in my lifecollege. For many, college may have been a cheerful and generally positive experience. If so, this film is not for you. However, if your daily consciousness wavered between states of bitterness at the realization of your superficial, two-dimensional, empty existence and complete apathy towards all outward stimuli with a universal disconnect of emotions being your only, yet wretched, solace, then you will appreciate what this film does. It captures all that melancholy, fear, tragedy and comedy and unabashedly, indeed gloriously, splays it before the viewer. In that light the above criticisms become moot, appearing neither gratuitous nor trite, but rather effectively bringing the key theme of desperation to the forefront. So come with this perspective in mind or don't come at all, because if you haven't felt this kind of despair before, you won't know, moreover, you won't care about what's going on in this film.",The Rules of Attraction

The cinematography was unbelievable.The performances of all the main characters, as well as the supporting characters was very real.  I felt that they captured the nuances of the characters from the book very well.

Editing would have helped.I thoroughly enjoyed the performances of the actors. Kudos to James Van Der Beek whose portrayal of the misogynistic Sean, blows the lid off of his teen idol stereotype and shows no sign of 'Dawson Leery' anywhere in this film. He definitely creeped me out...and I've known a few misogynists in my time...hey, I think I've even dated this guy! Shannyn Sossamon's touching performance as Lauren, the object of Sean's obsession, is the one humane voice of this film. I could also identify with the character of Paul, played by Ian Somerhalder, whose unrequited gay crush on Sean is all too real. Lastly, I loved Kate Bosworth's small bit, as one of Sean's pickups, where she cries when he sings and plays guitar for her. Too hilarious!A very complex and disturbing look at Gen X's malaise. Too bad the director tries too hard to make a 'cool' movie instead of just telling the story.",The Rules of Attraction

All the students are self absorbed, chain smoking, drug addicts (like we've never seen a Hollywood film with that before).  The supposedly married college professor looks to be about 3 months older than the students.  More of a high school soap than a movie about college students.

It is peopled by amoral, unlikeable characters with no redeeming features. There is very little in the way of story, so it is not in fact possible to type a spoiler even if you want to. Nothing happens. The protagonists just become less and less pleasant (if that is possible) as the film progresses. There are one or two characters that you might feel sorry for, but since their actions do not make sense, there is little point to them. Make no mistake, this is horrible.

I am sick of seeing movies about rich, white, drug abusing kids at liberal arts colleges and their freaking issues.  Oh you may argue that James Van der Beek ( or however you spell his name) was not rich and his selling drugs was due to his need to fit in.  OH PLEASE!!! A drug dealer is a drug dealer; whether he is in the ghetto or the rolling hills of a college campus.  All the actors were merely just playing themselves.

I would have to agree. It's a wonderfully executed film. But don't expect to feel like going out and playing with a basket full of kittens afterwards. Having graduated from a private arts college I am no stranger to the use of controlled substances and acts of sexual depravity, but hot damn.

But I have to respect a movie that can effect you in that way. But the masses would probably more entertained with *uck Everlasting. If you have a strong stomach, have had premarital sex and have actually INHALED a controlled substance before, open your head and appreciate Roger Avery's unique artistic vision of what us twenty somethings do best. Look good, have sex, and do drugs. I'm sorry if that was hard to swallow, but the majority of the movie going public are going to have to go straight to church after this one.

Me and my buddy only wanted to see it for one reason and that reason is because Jessica Biel is in it and we heard she was a crazy one, if ya catch my drift. So basically, we went to see her and boy were we ever mad. You see more masturbating, homosexuals, parties, and stuff that makes no sense what so ever than you do of her, kind of like The Rock in The Mummy Returns, like 5 mins worth...Thats it!

Yet with satire, i believe the story has to be taken to a certain extremity and maybe 'RUles of Attraction' just overdid it.For the people who hated it so much for its unrealistic aspects, please reconsider how unrealistic it actually is. It is very morbid, I'd agree. And almost nobody i know lives like this...but that's because I'm an American. In such places like third world countries, this IS how bad their lives are, maybe even an underestimate.In Asia, kids are beaten by their teachers frequently and a lot of times for no reason. There is no question that many teachers take advantage of their students.And students raping other students is certainly not unheard of (esp. while the victim is passed out drunk). Suicide is a common atrocity among teens and it is very f***ed up sometimes how we treat people, especially when it comes to relationships.I would just like to bring to attention that I thought it wasn't stretched or over profane. Simply, the obscenities took place all tied in together.

Or perhaps, more simply, the marketers were trying to bring in the largest audience possible by making it seem like this was a college soap opera that anyone could watch and understand.Having read some of the reviews for this movie, its clear that those who appreciated it understood the point of having a story (and story telling device) that is concerned primarily with style, not substance; a story that has no real likeable characters (or at least, hero or heroes), and imagery and language that is overly gratuitous and disturbing.  This film essentially is a mirror for youth culture today and in many ways is simply a documentary of modern life. I could write a lot more about this movie, but ultimately, that, for me, is what it comes down to.  Although I haven't read completely any of Bret Easton Ellis' works, I think a lot of credit must be given to him for the original story, though Roger Avary was a large part of this movie's making, and he did a brilliant job.If you are like me and fully understood and appreciated what this film was concerned about, then you find yourself deeply gratified that stories with such relevance and importance are still being told.",The Rules of Attraction

The message that I got was college students do a lot of drugs and drink a lot, and generally hate life and humanity alltogether. One interesting point though was some of the cinematography used...they had some neat effects with reversing the film and some other things like that, but they quickly wore off.

165,dmalamala,The film is flashy and pretentious,1,27 September 2002,"(a few minor SPOILERS) I saw this film at the Egyptian theatre a couple of nights ago and was actually quite excited sitting in the theatre waiting for the movie to start. I had been anticipating the film for quite some time now and was expecting something better than Avery's first film ""Killing Zoe"".  I had absolutely loved the Bret Easton Ellis novel and wanted Roger Avery's film to be just as good. But what I got was one of the worst movies of the year.There is no two ways about it, ""Rules of Attraction"" is one big gimmick. Roger Avery had the idea to put together a cast of teeny-bopper actors and actresses like James Van Der Beek and Jessica Biel and have them do repugnant, unspeakable things that they have never done on screen before. Fred Savage shooting up heroine, Van Der Beek having a bowel movement and checking the toilet paper to see if his ass is completely wiped, and Biel having sex with a plethora of men. These are just a few of the things you will see in ""Rules of Attraction"". Bret Easton Ellis' novel was a poignant, razor sharp piece of satire on contemporary sex and love and Avery has actually made a pretty faithful adaptation of the book, but unfortunately the amateurish, student film-like direction completely brings down the movie. Roger Avery said after the screening of the film that he approached the movie as if it were to be his last film. He wanted to incorporate every possible cinematographic and film technique that he ever wanted to use in a movie. In result to this approach Avery has failed to establish his own style. The film is flashy and pretentious with endless homages to Stanely Kubrick and other filmmakers.The only technique that Avery used that I actually enjoyed and found to be completely original was the spit screen sequence with James Van Der Beek and Shannyn Sossamon. It was put together extremely well and Avery said after the screening that it was a technique inspired by Douglas Sirk films. It did not hit me until right then how brilliant the sequence actually was.But besides that scene and a couple of nice homages(like Avery's homage to ""The Wicker Man""), the film wasn't very good. Roger Avery is definitely a talented writer, for he wrote some of the best scenes in ""Pulp Fiction"", and he also put together a couple of good sequences in ""Rules of Attraction"", but he has yet to prove that he can direct a good movie. Who knows? Maybe if Avery wasn't so fixated with how the film was going to look it would have been much better. One thing is for sure, on October 11th I'll be running out to see ""Punch Drunk Love"" and staying away from ""The Rules of Attraction"".",The Rules of Attraction
166,twoten,over hyped garbage totally void of quality,2,11 August 2005,"Every character in this film has the same personality. They are all vacant automatons living empty lives with empty brains knee jerking their way to their next abuse of sex, drugs, music etc. The characters are neither believable, likable, sympathetic nor developed. I suppose 12 year old teenage boys might think this film reveals what ""cool"" people are actually like, but any adult should be able to see that in real life one rarely encounters such demented assholes and a whole town full of them is just a childish fantasy. Both the author and director of this junk are way overpaid, over-hyped, and over convinced of their own brilliance which the discerning viewer will find no evidence of here.I've seen half hour TV cartoons that contain more believable and developed characters, that resonate more deeply with our shared human condition than anything in this film.Technically the acting isn't bad, the photography is good and the sound is horrible - indecipherable mumbled dialog that even the highest volume on my TV couldn't rescue, then cut to blasting loud music. I'm as sad as any of the unreal dummies in this flick when I think that crap like this gets made, applauded and the culprits become millionaires.

168,Zfire9969,Better than any other Ellis adaptation -,9,12 October 2002,"When I first heard rumor of the movie being made, I was kind of upset. I'm a big fan of all the Bret Easton Ellis novels with Rules of Attraction as my favorite. Past efforts to convert his books into movies have been disappointing to say the least. Less than Zero and American Psycho (despite great performances by Robert Downey, Jr. and Christian Bale) were both major let downs for most of the Ellis fanbase.Finally fans have something to be thankful for. Roger Avary has done a superb job in the direction he's taken this film. From the opening introductions to the backward end credits, the viewer is enthralled by the unique style he has displayed on the screen. The movie also stayed pretty close to the book, which is a good thing but obviously hard to do. Most of what is in the book are the thoughts of the characters and Avary successfully got those thoughts through. Help from the great acting by the ""questionable cast"" didn't hurt either.Many people were not sure how to act when emerging young television actors such as James Van Der Beek, Ian Somerhalder, and Jessica Biel were cast to play frequent horny drug users with no real emotions. But they did so with perfection. Shannyon Sossamon, Kip Pardue, and Clifton Collins, Jr. all gave flawless performances as well. The entire Victor segment matched if not surpassed that chapter in the book, and was one of my favorite parts of the movie. I was a little disappointed in the lack of Patrick Bateman but such scenes as Fred Savage's and the Jared's provided enough hilarious entertainment to take my mind off it.The plot of the movie goes something like this...drug dealing Sean Bateman falls in love with the innocent Lauren Hynde who has an ex-boyfriend, bi-sexual Paul Denton, that falls in love with Sean. This sexual triangle only becomes more tangled up you throw in Lauren's other ex-boyfriend Victor, her sex addict roomate Lara, a love struck secret admirer, many suicide attempts, a different and more angry drug dealer, a horny professor, and a bunch of naive uncaring college students.In the end, the movie succeeds in portraying how the lives of the young, apathetic, sex-driven, alcohol and drug downing, Camden College characters intertwine with one another in search of love while finding no such thing. So with the top notch directing, an excellent cast performance (especially from Van Der Beek, Sossamon, and Pardue), and even the great soundtrack - this movie is the best adaptation of a Bret Easton Ellis novel in exsistance.",The Rules of Attraction

172,jaydoubleu,Visually and aurally stunning. Shame the script never arrived,2,21 October 2002,"Saw The Rules of Attraction this weekend, and I must admit it was disappointing. Not that it's not without it's merits. Like most Lion's Gate productions it's beautifully shot, with all the split screens and reverse action shots giving the film a very distinctive look. The soundtrack, which runs the gamut from the Cure to Serge Gainsbourg, also adds a nice touch to the film. Roger Avary did a nice job adding the bells and whistles to the movie. Too bad he didn't use more of the time he devoted in this task to work on the script.I'm not really talking about the ""Oh no, not another no hope, Gen. X, everyone is so messed up"" plot that has some people up in arms. It's an adaptation of a Bret Easton Ellis book, and Bret Easton Ellis doesn't believe in happy endings. If you aren't into those kinds of movies, I recommend you stop reading these reviews now. What is more troubling is how poorly the characters are developed and the dialogue that almost always feels forced and awkward. James Vander Beek does a good job in giving Sean Bateman that sort of cool edge to him, but nearly every other performance falls a bit short. Especially Jessica Biel's. The central purpose of her character is that she's so unhappy with herself and her own life that she tries to keep everyone around her just as miserable (we've all known girls like this). The problem is when she tries to show this aspect of her character she falls flat on her face, be it the contrived crying scene after having sex with Sean or the awkward, parading around the room half-naked scene when she's ruining her roommates infatuation with Victor.All in all I'd give this film 2 out of 5 stars.

Instead, Roger Avary gives me a reason to wind up like the girl who slit her wrists in the bathtub. Scratch that, MANY reasons.I don't know if it was the DVD, or just the way the audio was done, but half the time my friend (whom I blame for renting this piece of crap) and I couldn't hear what was going on. We would turn up the volume and a scene later be blasted through the roof.The cinematography bothered me as well. There were a few scenes that I can (still, unfortunatly) think of where Roger Avary was trying to be avant garde like his former buddy Quinten Tarentino. Instead, he wound up just becoming another wanna be hip director who thumbs their nose at conventional cinematography for no reason other than to be cool. There's a word for that, Roger, it's called PRETENTION.The script, adapted from a novel apparently, seemed to make zero sense. I assume that a lot of it was probably done in a way to leave a lot of room for interpetation. However, one must be careful in how much room they leave, and there was way too much here.The only positive aspects I can think of was the acting by a few of the cast members, such as James Van Der Beek and Ian Somerhalder. For some reason, even though she was hardly seen, the girl in the bathtub (and other places in the film) was pretty attractive, even though it looked as if she had no make up on.Overall, if you haven't seen it, don't.

If you're expecting something cony and sentimental, go rent something with pink colors on the cover. So, let's go to the point. To truly understand and appreciate a movie like this you better have to be used to Bret Easton Ellis writing style. Drugs, hetero-homo-bi sex, violence, nonsense, mixed-up feelings, poisonous humor and the feeling that the whole story talks about nothing... You were looking for an easy-to-follow plot, whit a beginning and an end? The movie seems to have a plot then suddenly focuses on nothing, goes backwards, splits the screen, spends minutes on useless conversations and at a point you can think that somebody is making a pass on you. Well, that's the thing. Do you talk about literature at parties?, do you always go to class while on college?, do you do thinks like join Greenpeace when you're on drugs?, do you always resist temptations? Guess no. The Rules Of Attraction shows what life can be for people sometimes. Something full of empty actions and empty of meaningful acts. Nothing; nothing at all. Once the movie has finished and I agree with one of the reviews here that says that the abrupt finish could be the weakest point of the movie until you realize it matches perfectly the charisma of the whole story- you have this weird feeling inside, mixture of void and sadness, but at the same time you find yourself laughing out loud remembering some hysterically humoristic parts like when Paul meets again his pal from childhood and both their moms swallow pills with vodka while wondering which is the color of the next car one of them is about to buy. This is not a movie for everyone. Shocking scenes like the vomit on the intro, or the bathtub-suicide scene, explicit sex, a kiss between the two male characters -hi, homophobics- may lead some people out of the room. To the rest that liked to be thrilled and surprised with a movie, welcome! The Rules of Attraction makes you think about how people live their lives surfacing them, not going into deep, just adding hours of existence. You complain about the movie hasn't got a plot?

In this review I am going to try and act impartially towards at as an adaptation.The first fifteen minutes are determined to hook you in; flashy camera work, chronological restructuring and in your face character introductions. We have Lauren, Paul and Sean; where do we go from there, (well backwards in fact), but not very far at all. The rest of the film lacks structure and therefore plays out like a sketch show with scenes lifted from the source material.The film lacks plot, character arcs or goals. The film is counter-cinema masquerading as mainstream. What the film does have is characters, and the film is its own characters; good looking, clever, subverting and ultimately selfish, it is more concerned with pleasing itself than pleasing the audience.I enjoyed the film but had a strange suspicion there was something deeper lurking beneath.",The Rules of Attraction
182,TWSG,This movie has been severely mis-marketed. Thank GOD!,8,12 October 2002,"To describe this movie as challenging would be an understatement.  To even PRETEND that this movie is going to last beyond the first weekend at the box office is ludicrous.  And you know what?  I think that's the only way this movie is going to find it's REAL audience.  Advertised as a ""darker American Pie"" (not overtly, but they might as well just say it), everyone who read the book was hoping and praying that maybe the marketing department didn't know what to do with a movie like this, maybe they saw the film itself as a problem and their remedy was to sell it the way they would any unnecessary teen sex romp.  Needless to say, my fears were quelled when the film started off with one of the most difficult (and disturbing) scenes in the book, Lauren losing her virginity.  From that point on it was a surprisingly faithful (though at some points very oddly different) take on an already great novel.  What follows, however, is a short list of changes/additions to the book I was confused by.  I hope this doesn't make my review sound negative, I would just like to give fans of the book a heads up on what to expect.  Needless to say, spoilers will ensue.*SPOILERS*First of all, why did they make Lauren a virgin?  One of the key elements to Lauren's character was her ambivalent nature towards sex, almost seeing it as a necessary evil.  Granted they did a good job of displaying her unadultered affection for Victor, but the fact that she's virginal eliminates the entire subplot with Sean and the baby.  Now granted that was a story that would've probably been difficult as hell to realize on the screen because of how many other stories there were to tell, but I always thought the part of the book with Lauren accepting the notion of marriage and then quickly growing to detest it (and Sean) was brilliantly written. I guess including this story would have also cemented Lauren as being uncaring and indifferent to everything, but isn't that the point of the novel?  One thing the book exhibits extremely well is the complete lack of empathy (or any feeling for that matter) in the lives of these students.  Everyone is out for themselves, sex means less than a handshake, these are all values Ellis seems to dislike and would rather write about satirically than preach. Then again I would never assume what Ellis was thinking when he wrote the book, that's just my opinion on the matter.  Anyway, I guess in the end I felt the version of Lauren embodied on the screen was a bit of a cop-out. It makes Sean Bateman's infatuation with her all the more cliche, the slutty guy falling for the pure as snow girl.  And come to think of it, that brings me to my next point...Why in the world did they do away with the REAL story behind Sean?  One of the great surprises in the book was to discover that Sean wasn't really on financial aid, and was in fact a member of an affluent family (including none other than Patrick ""American Psycho"" Bateman).  I mean, what do the scenes with Rupert mean if you don't get to find out that Sean's had the ability to pay him back all this time?  It completely eliminates the notion of fun Sean sees in these near-death experiences.Why in the world did they explain WHO committed suicide?  Quite easily the best surprise in the book simply because you never know WHO did it, the movie completely does away with this idea and not only shows us WHO kills herself over Sean, but WHY.  God, we even get a montage of shots showing she was there all the times Sean was there!  While on this subject, however, I'd like to mention that the suicide scene was filmed BEAUTIFULLY, just as I'd imagined it while reading the book.  The only thing I missed was the inner monologue she has right before her death, the stream of consciousness that seems to flow from her mind as steadily as the blood from her wrists. Regardless, beautiful scene, excellent use of Harry Nilsson's ""Without You"" (more people need to use his music in movies, dammit!), I was just disappointed to have so much explained to me.Regarding inner monologues, what the hell was with the disappearing/reappearing moments of introspection?  I mean when you REALLY think about it, the entire book is a big inner monologue from a variety of characters, with snippets of dialogue thrown in when they feel like re-telling a story.  The movie seemed to get that idea most of the time, but then would completely disregard it.  I know, I know, hearing someone's musings on something that's happening right in front of you would get very redundant, but then why introduce that storytelling structure in the first place?  While on that subject, I have to say that the forwards/reverse segues from character to character in the beginning were beautifully done. Reading the book I would have never thought to visualize it that way, and it was a very interesting idea to see realized.  The palindromic music definately helped, and that is without a doubt a soundtrack I'm going to buy.  VERY good score.Last on my list of ""confusions"" (not complaints!), why were alot of scenes from the book that showcased how much perception can warp social interactions taken out?  A great example of this is the scene in the book where Paul asks Sean out.  From Paul's perspective we get the opinion of Sean as this timid, meek closet case.  From Sean's perspective, we see a guy who's confused as hell as to why Paul is asking him out.  It was a brilliantly written scene, and the fact that it's not included in the movie makes the later scenes with Paul fawning over Sean seem out of place.*Spoilers End*In closing I'd like to say that regardless of the changes made in the book-to-film translation (which I only mentioned because some didn't seem necessary), this is an excellent, thought-provoking glimpse at the jaded lives of upper-class college kids.  The casting was exquisite (almost EVERY character literally looked just as I'd imagined them when reading the book, especially Paul), the direction was bar-none the most inventive I've seen this year, the script did as good a job at adapting this book as I could imagine, and in the end the point was still made.  The scenes I think they adapted the best would have to be the ""O.D.'ing freshman goes to the doctor"" (I can still remember bursting out laughing when I read that in the book), Sean attempting to kill himself, Victor's European endeavors (I practically felt breathless listening to him ramble on) and Sean's drug deal gone sour. If you've read the book you owe it to yourself to see this movie, if only for the scenes they practically lifted straight out of the book and into the film.  If you haven't read the book then prepared to be shocked and confused, and most importantly to think.  Oh, and don't be surprised if the audience throws a fit at the end.  Granted there were only four other people in the theater when I saw it, but three of them stormed out the minute it ended.  I guess all I ask is that you prepare to be challenged.",The Rules of Attraction

Both of these aspects are constant in this movie which manages to portray college life accurately (at least for trust fund babies) regardless. The characters are interesting, the little brother of Bateman the serial killer of American Psycho is played to perfection surprisingly by Van Der Beek. The cinematography is astounding with some great split screen shots and reverse action. The plot is there, but pretty open. The movie functions more as a personal diary of the three main characters than as a plot device. All in all its a great character piece with great writing, amazing imagery, and some great performances.",The Rules of Attraction
185,Swingers-2,You either love it or you hate it.,8,29 October 2002,"Let me start off by saying, ""The Rules of Attraction"" is not a good movie. You don't walk away from it and say to yourself, ""Wow, what a great movie."" There's nothing worthwhile or impressive about this film. It's like one of those roller coaster rides that throws your body back and forth, slams your head repeatedly into the back of the seat, gives you whiplash, makes you vomit all over yourself, and then when you get off you find yourself saying, ""Eh, it wasn't that good.""That being said, I could go back and see this movie again and again. A movie doesn't always have to be good to make it enjoyable. The Rules of Attraction (ROA) is so funny, so outrageous, and so shameless that it almost makes you feel guilty for watching it. Like the bathroom scene where Sean Bateman, played by James Van Der Beek, sits on the toilet and takes a dump. Not only do we get to watch the entire process take place, but we're also treated to the little facial expressions Bateman makes as he pushes another one out. It's disgusting, yes, but at the same time very funny.There are probably twenty or so scenes just like that in ROA that I can think back on and laugh at, even a week after seeing it. And they're uncomfortable laughs too, like when you're not supposed to laugh at something but you just can't help yourself. Like in the Diner Scene, where the three guys are sitting around talking about sex with underage girls, and the one guy yells out, ""Old enough to pee, old enough for me!"" I didn't want to laugh, nobody in the theater did... But we laughed anyway.Maybe the best part of the entire movie is when Victor, played by the Sunshine boy in ""Remember the Titans"", rehashes his entire European vacation in about 60 seconds. It's utterly jaw-dropping. So much to take in in so little time. I could go back and watch ROA for that one scene alone.But I realize ""The Rules of Attraction"" probably isn't for everyone. It's one of those movies where you either love it or hate it. But whether it offends you, makes you feel completely uncomfortable, or even makes you vomit all over yourself, you're at least going to feel something. I wish I could say that about a lot of the movies out there today.",The Rules of Attraction

For those of you who don't know, Roger co-wrote PULP f###ing FICTION, the best movie on the planet. After watching Rules of Attraction, it became obvious that Tarantino did 95% of the writing in Pulp Fiction, because Avery's script sucked. The acting was decent, but the camera work was trying so hard to be original and unique but it turned out incredibly annoying. The writing (especially in the scenes with the drug-dealer) was one-hundred percent Tarantino wanna-be dialogue. And last but not least, it wasn't funny at all when at many points it was obvious that the movie was trying to be. The only promising scene was the scene in the restaurant with the two mothers. I cracked up on that part. Other than that, it sucked. Maybe the movie wouldn't be so bad to me if I didn't expect more from Roger Avary.

The Rules of Attraction is just as disturbing, but without the humor or irony.  This movie is so far from reality that it makes David Lynch look like a documentarist.

193,PauseDotCom,"Boring, pointless, shallow exercise in self-gratification",1,16 October 2002,"It is so obvious, after seeing this movie, that the writer / director felt as though this was going to be The Next Great Little Movie. Unfortunately, while movies like American Beauty and Mulholland Drive and Requiem for a Dream were inventive, insightful and, each in their own particular way, honest, Rules of Attraction is none of those things. It is a shallow, unrealistic look at a bunch of pathetic losers, each of whom feels he or she is so important. The wall to wall music shares space with wall to wall idiocy that feigns depth in nearly every scene. You have to sort of just shrug your shoulders at a film in which almost every person that appears onscreen is either drunk, on drugs, a sexual deviant or at the very least, completely loathsome. And there is no genesis for the charicatures'...ooops, I mean characters'...depressing states of being. Oh, the poor little rich kids who are so bored with life that they have to turn towards the dark side of drugs and demeaning sex. Please. That lame angle has been tweaked so much more cleverly than even the best scene in this waste of time. And what was the best scene in this movie? I can't remember. I'm not sure if it's because the characters were so thin and weak that I simply didn't care about a single one of them, or if it's because the film as a whole could be described in exactly the same way. Normally I would comment on the performances of the actors and actresses in a movie, some of whom are very talented individuals. In this case, however, the premise and characters are so devoid of any meaning, the editing and dialog so contrived, that it would be akin to rating the performance of a serial killer putting a few random pieces into a jigsaw puzzle: In the end you don't really get a clear picture of anything, and they're not people you'd want to spend time with anyway.",The Rules of Attraction
194,fmarchione,Brilliant adaptation of Ellis novel,9,13 October 2002,"Roger Avery succedes brilliantly in this impressive and horrifying adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' first novel. I read the novel 4 years ago as a Freshman in college after being blown away by 'American Psycho' and wanted to make 'Rules' into a film myself thinking no one would ever try. So much for that. Anyway, Avery impressed me alot. The series of Patrick Bateman references are also quite amusing for readers/viewers familiar with 'American Psycho'Some reviewers have tended to comment on Avery's use of visual gimmicks, but he puts them to use well. The split screen where Sean meets Lauren is perfect, showing the seperation between them. The backwards film also works, showing how relatively meaningless many of the actions are, while drawing attention to them at the same time.
One last thing. People, including here on the IMDB have been criticizing the characters for being one-dimensional. THAT IS THE POINT. Ellis' characters ARE one-dimensional. What you get is a boat-load of information about all of these people and what you are left with is an empty being, soulless, if you will. It works. YOU aren't SUPPOSED to be attached to these characters because THEY are not attached to themselves or anyone else.

195,maleficent2010,Depth of an After-School Special,2,13 October 2002,"Add one more to the ""nay"" vote.  My friends and I broke down with 10 minutes left to go in the film.  We couldn't take it anymore and walked out.I love dark, satirical stories.  While flawed, ""American Psycho"" at least entertained the viewer and had very good performances by Christian Bale and Reese Witherspoon.  ""The Rules of Attraction"" has very little to offer other than one or two laughs.I'm fine with not having to love or even like the protagonists in order to enjoy a film, but the characters were too dull.  So what if the point was to make them shallow?  After-school specials had one-note characters for the same reason i.e. to get a point across.  Does anyone sing the artistic praises of after-school specials?  Maybe they would've if they showed drug use and sex.Besides the boring characters and thin plot, the film techniques (split screen, putting it in reverse, etc.) were distracting and thus annoying. It goes to show that one can have a vast knowledge of filmmaking techniques, but if there is no artistry behind it, it's all sound and fury signifying nothing.",The Rules of Attraction
196,avid-mcguire,"A dark, twisted and humorously acerbic little gem!",9,7 February 2012,"As you can see from the reviews of this film, the film refuses to let people leave on the middle ground , the ratings are on average either 9 or 10 *'s or they are at the other end of the spectrum at 1 or 2 *'s. Some applaud this film for being a blackly humorous, acerbically dark study on those poor unfortunates caught in the years between parental guidance and adult wisdom, where the cruel thrive and the meek barely survive, while others just call the film out as a flamboyantly depressive piece of trash created to crudely glamorize (or rather exploit for our entertainment) the self induced problems of today's college core, rather than preach the error of their ways. Brett Easton Ellis, author of a number of novels that take a satirical look at the morally depraved and emotionally bankrupt that inhabit society, wrote the book to which the film is based. Roger Avary Academy Award winning writer (Co-Wrote Pulp Fiction) directs.The film details the tribulations of a trio of leading characters, whose lives interconnect and impact upon one another in the most earnest and impersonal of ways imaginable. Sean Bateman (brilliantly played by James Van Der Beek), Lauren Hynde (Shannyn Sossaman) and Paul Denton (Ian Somerhalder) are 3 college alumni attending a New England Arts school, although all 3 share a slightly detached existence, revealing their most personal and selfish thoughts to themselves, they all are at varying stages of completely slipping into the drug fueled and selfish strewn haze that seems to be campus life.Lauren is a virgin fixated on having herself deflowered to her supposed beau Victor, a quick talking, promiscuous globe trekker who in no circumstance shows any interest in Lauren, she struggles with the pressures of temptations of college, that includes a flirtation with her teacher (Eric Stoltz) and a sultry roommate Lara (Jessica Biel), and dealing with an attraction to resident drug dealer Sean Bateman with whom she harbors a crush and shares a flirtation. Paul Denton is a manipulative and coy homosexual intent on bagging closeted straight men to varying degrees of success, he is bent on seducing the elusive and un-interested Sean Bateman who is straight and unknowingly rebuffing all advances. Finally there is Sean Bateman, younger sibling of thrice more inhuman brother Patrick (nope he's not in the movie), who is the midst of what appears to be a mild emotional breakdown, Sean feel detached from his fellow college dwellers and seems to only show any joy when opening the mail to find a series of love letters which he believes to be from Lauren. Sean is also indebted to drug dealer and Cocaine addict Rip (the superb Clifton Collins Jnr.), Sean is going through the angst of love, drug abuse, quasi suicidal tendencies and what could be a underlying sociopathic disorder. The film navigates through a series of themed parties that take place constantly on campus in a non linear fashion.The acting of the film is truly a highlight, those of us who remember Van Der Beek from Dawson's Creek will be blown back by the monster he portrays on screen, an apathetic creature needing meaning in his life too caught up in the trivialities of his problems to seek it. He is ably supported by fellow leads Sossaman and Somerhalder who are equally engaging in their roles, Sossaman plays a highly contrasting character as both an innocent scarred by, and a willing participant, of the sordid games of her social scene, whilst Somerhalder plays the deeper than perceptions first meet homosexual yearning for connection in anyone, literally anyone who takes his wandering fancy.The supporting cast sparkles with some of today's easy to recognise faces including Stoltz as a student-like professor and Collins Jnr. as an unpredictable and edgy dealer with a hair triggered temper. Of special note is the River Phoenix-esque, gay teen Richard or 'DICK', a friend of Paul's, (played by Russell Sams) who steals his scenes in a mad cap fashion.The style of the film also makes this easy to watch, with a large array of odd and polished camera styles coming into play, quirky editing maneuvers and an atmospheric soundtrack adding immensely to the film.To finish off, this film may not be for you. But the film really isn't all that bad, a lethal intro whereby all characters reveal their inner most feelings whilst being involved in near heinous situations, as both villains and victims, the movie takes you on a ride from there painting the world of college as a parent funded drug den where narcoticss are used to belong and add highs to an otherwise deadpan existence, and casual, or even barely acknowledgeable, sex is used to alleviate the comedown. It trails 3 characters who aren't too worried about their own personal flaws but instead try to make use of their perceived problems in order to ease their consciences into accepting with little guilt what their willing to do to achieve their self absorbed goals and excuse whatever misdeeds they commit.",The Rules of Attraction

Loved the reverse, loved the commentary of each character, loved how we saw from different characters points of view.  Loved James Van Der Beek & Shannyn Sossaman.  Only after watching the DVD special features, did I GET what was intended.  It's supposed to be this love triangle.  However, because other characters are thrown in there --Victor & Jessica Biel, I think the main POINT is somewhat lost.  So, Lauren & Paul used to date?  Why does Sean ""love"" Lauren so much?

199,rambler-9,Do believe the critics - dreadful flick,3,25 June 2010,"The narration at the very beginning of the film hits it right on the head. It's boring.An unlikable plot about a group of unlikable characters doing unlikable things, to themselves and each other. A (classic? Hardly) love quadrangle forms the central plot, with no-one wanting to be with anyone else that actually likes him or her. To compensate, the characters get high, get drunk, and mope. Extensively.While I'm giving a score of 3 simply because so many of the characters are well-acted and look good with no clothes on, other than those two things, there's really nothing to recommend this film. I've seen people comment that the film is wonderfully realistic. If this film matches your reality, I am sorry. You should turn your life in and get a refund, and buy a new one from a better trim line. Really? EVERY SINGLE PERSON on Earth does not get drunk, do drugs, and make everyone else they know miserable.Finally, after an unsatisfying ride through the film awaiting something interesting to break out, we have an unsatisfying ending. I guess the point of the movie is that life is unsatisfying. Personally, I go to movies to get something different, not to be bored or depressed. I can get that from real life, with people that are much happier and nicer to be around! Overall - I'll take movies that entertain me, thanks. Rules of Attraction?

Casting James Van Der Beek (television's squeaky clean Dawson) as Sean Bateman, an intense college kid who sleeps around and deals drugs, is a bold piece of casting that really pays off.Roger Avary's (Killing Zoe) third movie in the director's chair focuses on Bateman and other disaffected rich kids sleeping and snorting their way through college, moving from one party to the next in the search for loveless sex. The tag of 'beautiful outside, ugly inside' fits almost every character in this film perfectly. The only character for which one has any sympathy is Lauren (Shannon Sossamon) who is saving herself for the right guy, but will she find him here? It seems unlikely. And anyway, even she blows her college professor for better grades.Dawson's Creek this is most definitely not. Scenes of suicide, rape and, most bizarrely, Van Der Beek straining on the toilet, mean that this is not a wholesome family movie. Don't be put off though. The bold style, great soundtrack and strong performances from a very talented young cast makes this an engaging if bruising movie.Take a deep breath, pay your £8, take your seat and try not to choke on your popcorn.**** / *****",The Rules of Attraction
201,nickybabes,refreshingly nasty slice of cynicism,8,3 March 2003,"This is a movie that will sicken many people. Roger Avary faced a massive challenge when deciding to direct a film of Bret Easton Ellis' complex and hallucinary book. The book has no narrative focus, no beginning or end and focuses on a group of selfish, morally ambiguous characters. The story deals with drugs, rape, homosexuality,and obsessions of every kind, and despite Lion's Gate's best efforts to market the movie as a american pie-lite slice o' college life- the movie bombed in America.However i feel that there is much in this movie to commend. While the movie provides its central characters with zero morals, it never paints its youths as all smiling jocks in way american pie did with paper-thin characters such as the ""stiffmeister"". While the ""pie"" movies were just funny, this one has its darkly funny moments intermixed with scenes of tragedy and sadness. Don't think teen movie when choosing to see this film, you should be thinking more of Fight Club. These charachters are apathetic lost souls, people who we should be wary of becoming. This is a movie without resolution or love, but it is one worth seeing. Avary scores a slam-dunk with the brilliant forwards-backwards beginning which manages to stay faithful to the spirit of the source material, whilst also being stylish and exciting to watch. Also a scene where an obsessive admirer of Sean (James' Van Der Beek's character) choses to end her life is as emotionally devastating as anything i have seen in the cinema for a long time. Avary deploys his camera very cleverly in this scene, and it never appears too graphic. This scene in particular really captures the essence of Ellis's book, as does Victor's thrilling trip round Europe. I was however disappointed that Paul's character had been cut down so much. Many fantastic scenes between Paul and Sean are missing from the book, rendering the relationship between the two conventional and flat. The major drawback of the film was that it often felt like a collection of great scenes stuck together without enough glue between them. I think if the movie had run ten minutes longer, or some of the scenes with Rupert, Sean's Dealer had been cut in length, then this movie would have worked better. I must add that i loved the soundtrack and it was one of the best i have heard since The Royal Tennenbaums. Lastly, special commendation must go to James Van Der Beek's excellent portrayal of Sean, the film's shark-eyed, drug-dealing lead. He really suprised me, as i hated this casting decision at first.",The Rules of Attraction

And I thought that American Psycho from Ellis' novel was interesting, albeit somewhat disturbing. But I found that the subject matter of this film was not enjoyable on any level. It seemed to cross the line of decency for the sake of crossing the line and glorified the twisted lifestyles of these messed up people. I have no problem with making a film about people who are disturbed or immoral or have huge bizarre problems. But if you are going to do that, you should have something interesting to say about it. Just showing me people who are pathetic isn't enough. Do something with it.

I have always wanted to like Avery, I felt bad for him because he was always in tarantinos shadow.  Seriously, there is absolutley no narrative structure in this film.  Sometimes this can be pulled off, if you have good dialouge. And having a character that uses the word ""F***"" every other word does not good dialouge make.  The camera tricks were cool at first, then just tedious.  I mean, I get what the movie was trying to say, and I like Ellis' novel, but this movie is just way over the top.  To make a movie where 100% of the characters are unlikable, I am sorry, that world does not exist. And yes, I understand satire, but satire is funny, this does not pass as humor. And where is the college that girls run around naked at a party, i wanna go, and I'll tell you what, I sure as hell wouldn't be talking to the only one wearing clothes. Is that a social commentary on the over sexuality of today's youth? I hope so, because I went to college, I also went to Tijuana, that s*** does not exist outside of the AVN awards.Mr. Avery, I have seen you in interviews, you are a humorous and intellegent man, and you have made three terrible movies.  I think you can do better, just please find your cinematic voice.  Or let someone else take a crack at the script.  This movie has the worst script I have ever seen by someone who has won an Oscar for writing! Please do not let us believe that you got your oscar because QT wrote a good screenplay. Give us something, you've got a platform to speak on and make us laugh, do it.  Let Larry Clark show us the evil of today's youth, because I liked this movie better the first time I saw it and it was called ""Bully"". I will say one positive.  The europe scene: Brilliant! anyone who knows anybody who went to Europe for a summer during college, that is exactley what their story sounds like.

This movie will do it.  It was horrible.  Every message the movie wanted to convey it tried too hard to do so.  It was overly intentionally dark.  The plot was real weak and the characters were so scattered and did things that didn't seem to fit their background information from the beginning of the film.  It makes me angry just typing about it.  Don't see this movie!  3/10.,The Rules of Attraction
206,saradawn,No! Not amusing! Not ironic! Not funny!,1,13 October 2002,"I had such high hopes for this movie, but it was just bad. Not even so bad you could laugh at it. Just painfully bad. If I weren't an optimist who sincerely believed the movie would get better and worthwhile, I would have walked out.The technique of running parts of the film backwards wasn't novel or inventive, it was done for such long stretches that it became trite and annoying. And ten minutes into the film, I was already tired of getting ""the look"" from James Van Der Beek. For some reason the director insisted on having what felt like at least five dozen shots that consist of a close-up of JVDB with his head tilted down slightly glowering at you under his crazy eyebrows.The only funny part was Fred Savage's cameo. Eric Stoltz, as much as I love him, was so creepy I felt like I needed a shower afterwards. Shannyn Sossaman did better than I expected and Ian Somerhalder was pretty good, but otherwise it was bad bad bad.Do yourself a favor.

207,jonwalters-1,There are no rules!,10,12 April 2007,"""The Rules of Attraction"" I don't know where to start; literally, even the film begins telling us the story from the end. The film centres on the weekend of three main characters Sean, Lauren and Paul, all who are romantically intertwined, and the shenanigans that consist of their over partied lives in college, a day in the life if it were. Sex, drugs, rock n roll, not to mention suicide and unrequited love all are major players in this film. Jason Van Der Beek (TV's Dawson of ""Dawson's Creek"") gives a great performance playing Sean Bateman; a small drug dealer on campus that is in love with a virgin named Lauren (Shannyn Sossamon / ""40 Days & 40 Nights""). However, she is in love with drug loving Victor, who has just got back from a European vacation. Bisexual Paul (Ian Somerhalder, TV's Boone in ""Lost"") falls in love with Sean and then things start to get even more complicated. Very much focused at the teen audience, the social realism portrayed as well as the heartache, I think the audience could certainly feel a connection with some of the characters; Kate Bosworth, Jessica Biel and Thomas Ian Nicholas also star.""The Rules of Attraction"" is a Bret Easton novel (American Psycho) which has been superbly adapted for the screen by Roger Avary, who happened to work in the same video store as Quentin Tarrantino. I think that gives you an idea of what this film is going to be like; no A to Z plot, no beginning, middle & end and definitely no censorship. Filmed with great expertise, this fantastic story is presented to us in the form of split screen, rewind mode and repetition. The attention to detail is fantastic and the more you watch it, the more things you will notice in the subtle settings. The soundtrack too, adds to the films success. Whilst using songs from an array of genres (European Dance/ 80's pop/ indie-rock etc) every scene and mood is enhanced. This film has everything that separates an excellent film from just a good film!",The Rules of Attraction
208,DemonJD138,Ellis's finest...,8,3 February 2004,"The most accurate adaption of Ellis's work to date.  It is not accurate in that it follows the novel exactly, but it keeps the spirit of the book much better than either American Psycho or Less Than Zero.Beyond that, it is one of the most accurate portrayals of American college life that I've ever seen, disturbing though that may be.  Van Der Beek, Sossamon, Sommerhalder and Pardue all turn in brilliant performances.  The only thing that really hurts the film is the presence of Biel, but that can be overlooked as the rest of the cast shines.  ***1/2 out of ****",The Rules of Attraction
209,xprettyxstickx,"Strange yet, really good!?!",9,4 July 2007,"okay, so originally I only began watching the movie because I saw that James Vander Beek was in it and I'm a huge Dawson's fan but I soon realized it was quite the opposite of that. Both the main and supporting characters are obviously contorted and filled with problems and strung out on drugs and alcohol throughout the movie but that made me like it all the more.The wonderful way of special effects of filming (i.e. - reversed credits, split screens, rewinding scenes) made it more appealing to see what happens. I found myself questioning why Sean entered the party with cuts, and why Lauren was pronounced a virgin throughout the movie when she obviously lost it at the end of the world party but I quickly realized the movie was running at that same time of special effects of filming by taking on a running of reverse thing.Although their was no real reason behind Sean's love for Lauren besides the fact that he thought she wrote the letters I found myself wanting them to end up together.I began watching this movie at 230 in the morning and couldn't go to sleep until it was done no matter how tired I was. I was addicted and laughed out loud on several occasions. It was a dark comedy of sorts and the characters didn't have much to go for but in some strange way they were relatable.So obviously coming into this movie as a Dawson's Creek fan I didn't get what I expected from the boy down the creek but this was probably better. I most defiantly suggest this movie. GREAT",The Rules of Attraction

The film went nowhere, and was too depressing and empty. Save your money! Go see the Red Dragon instead, or stay home and read the book!The film grade  C-",The Rules of Attraction
211,ma_cole,Cool movie,9,5 September 2006,"People say the this movie is supposed to be a satire, or that Bret Eastern Ellis (who wrote the book on which it is based) is a satirist and in actual fact a harsh moralist who writes in a deliberately flat manner about empty vacuous souls to highlight the deteriorating moral fabric of modern society. I'm afraid I have never read one of his books so I don't know about all this kind of thing but I did really enjoy this film.It reminded me a lot of my own days at college. I think I most sympathised with the character of Paul (played by the gorgeous Ian Somerhalder now better known for the TV show Lost). He is supposedly bisexual although the film kinda suggests that he is coming to terms with his homosexuality and perhaps his previous hetero relationships were not altogether convincing (as if he was trying to 'prove' his hetero-ness). This is a bit like me except I am 50/50 bi, I like women exactly as much as I like men but I could sympathise with him a lot. Anyway, he is in love with Sean Bateman (played by Dawson from Dawson's Creek, James vanderBeek) but Sean is in love with Lauren (Shannon Sossamon from 40 days and 40 nights) who is in love with Sean for a bit but then in love with Victor (who is played by Kip Pardue and has been to Europe). It is all a bit convoluted. lol :) Nobody really cares about anybody else, which is quite realistic to college, and there are also lots of parties for any old excuse (like for example there was an 'End of the World Party', but I don't think it was actually the end of the world!), and lots of drugs and alcohol which is also very realistic. The director captures very well the realities of being that kind of age and trying to act like what you imagine an adult acts like but in actual fact being a bit insecure but also at the same time, perhaps for the same reasons, being open to experimentation with substances and sexuality and things like that. I have to admit that when I was at college I was not as confident as Paul seems to be at first but then he becomes a little less confident when Sean appears oblivious to his advances and when I was at college I became MORE confident as time went on so maybe by the end of the movie me and Paul are quite the same.The director also uses lots of clever techniques like split screens and reverse motion which reminded me a bit of Darren Aronfosky and his film 'Requiem for a Dream' which was also very realistic and captured exactly what it is like to be a heroin addict by using these techniques. For example there is a scene in RoA (Rules of Attraction) where Sean and Lauren don't really know each other yet and are approaching from opposite ends of a corridor. We see both of them at the same time in split screen which indicates that they are from different worlds and are disconnected in their lives, maybe it signifies that all the characters are detached in this way, but maybe I'm getting too intellectual! But mainly this movie is just fun. There are lots of beautiful people in it and funny dialogue as well as some quite difficult scenes - for example a rape and a suicide which really make you think. There is lots of good times though and perhaps it is a good movie to watch when you are high or drunk - when I watched it I was completely straight though, I try to resist temptation these days, and I still enjoyed it a lot.My only complaint is that on my copy of the DVD the film cuts off before the end so I didn't find out what Sean Bateman was thinking of right at the end. But that is my only complaint, otherwise a really cool movie. I recommend it to everyone.",The Rules of Attraction
212,Funkyfuzzyduckie,I did NOT like this movie,1,10 January 2004,"Maybe it was just me. But I personally did not like this movie, maybe it was too original an artistic for me but it just was not good. I watched it with two other people and we just did not like it. The acting was good without a doubt, I will give every actor that but the plot and range of motion on this movie went was not for me. The ending to me was to sudden and needed to have more of a closing and other scenes to me were just to much,(Wee bit of a spoiler) such as the girl who began cutting herself in the bathtub and before you knew it the whole thing was filled with blood.I know that this life is most likely a reality, a harsh dark reality and maybe I was not in the mood for it. But I watched Stealing Harvard after this movie and felt that, that movie deserved an Oscar compared to this.",The Rules of Attraction
213,laxdoctor,Full marks.,10,15 October 2002,"I awaited this film with considerable anticipation, given its pedigree. I found American Psycho to be a stunningly sharp satire and the novel on which this current film is based was at least as good. The production team for AP did a brave bit of work and Patrick Bateman's pathetic psychotic -- gruesomely dangerous in his own mind only -- was brilliantly portrayed by Christian Bale. The people behind the production of RoA already had considerable merit in my eyes and the cast members had promise and, clearly, some of them were willing to stretch their repertoires (and risk their comfortable and monetarily rewarding niches, particularly Van Der Beek) to participate in this film.
All in all, it's every bit the gem of a film as AP was, and I'm neither surprised nor bothered by the negative reviews it's getting (just as AP did, in the main). There are ribald scenes that would make Rabelais guffaw, and nervy ones of the sort rarely seen in American films (it took a long time to find a studio and then a distributor for this film). The acting is very good from top to bottom, and it was worth the price of admission just to see ""Dick"" and Paul with their mommies in New York, Kip Pardue's two-weeks-in-Europe-in-four-minutes (which Avery filmed during a genuine two-week junket to Europe by Pardue), the absolute asynchrony in the subjective experience of the bus scene (Paul and Sean), the mechanical sex between Laura and Sean, the snowflake (absolutely inspired) and, well, lots of other scenes to boot.The filmmakers copped out on one score only -- the relationship between Sean and Paul in the novel is much more, well, complicated than in the film, and the film would have been even stronger had it kept that part of the story line intact. Nonetheless, this film rates as one of the best satires I've seen, as strong as ""Bully"" but in a different vein. It's destined, I imagine, to be ignored by most, despised by many others, and celebrated by a minority of people like myself, hopelessly deranged, no doubt, but gleefully cheering on indie films with grit and guts.",The Rules of Attraction

215,kjosentoin,good. good. good. good. good.,10,26 October 2002,"This film read my mind. Everything I had been wanting to see was drilled into my eyes with cinematic precision and visually shaped thought waves about the college life I never had. The characters are ever revealing but still always mysterious. And the dark but playful storyline wanders through a new and unique atmosphere like a baby through a soft maze., focusing always on the detailed portrait of detail and portraition, and with no regards to answering the concerns of the viewer who can only long for a wrapped-up ending. Each scene is a marvel and fun on its own, although I'd have to say among my favorite scenes are Victor's memoirs of Europe, Dick's performance in the restaurant, all the backwards stuff in the beginning, and all the scenes with Rupert. Despite my positive appraisal, this movie is not for everyone. Some people find it disturbing.

216,MrGrey00,Patrick Bateman must be rolling in his satin sheets,1,17 October 2002,"To preface:  I really enjoyed American Psycho, book and film.  I thought both were well done, vicious satires that got too little praise for their content.That having been said, it's possible that the Rules of Attraction is the worst movie I've ever seen.Roger Avary decided to choose some some strange recurring camera effects throughout, the most prominent of which is reverse playback to demonstrate returning to a previous moment, usually to switch strands of the plot.  In the five or six times he does it, the reverse goes on FAR too long.  Do we have to shout, ""I GET IT!"" for him to go on with the film?  There is also a scene in which there are dual cameras following two characters, and the two shots, in the least subtle way possible, finally become one.  Again, a one-minute scene takes about ten.  It's as if he is trying to stretch the script, knowing well he has little substance.*SPOILERS*How many things does the movie leave unsolved?  Does Sean really sleep with the girl he meets at the party?  Does Lauren actually lose her virginity that night?  What's the point of showing Paul's ridiculous friend from home? Why doesn't Victor remember Lauren?  There's ambiguity, and then there's guaranteed confusion.  The script seems like it's about five drafts away from being shot.*END OF SPOILERS*About the only good thing I can say, and it seems too absurd to even type, is that I liked James Van Der Beek's facial expressions.  He can look downright evil when he wants to.  As a friend said, he looks like Jon Gruden on the sidelines of a Bucs game.

219,pusherman0,"READ THIS if your deciding to watch this movie, or not",1,23 February 2003,"This movie lacks direction, character development, and a protagonist. When there is little character development and the characters are getting dumped upon throughout the entire movie it is hard to have even a shred of sympathy for them.  The main character of the movie, James Van Der Beek, we know nothing about except that he is in school, uses and sells drugs, and is a pretentious prick.  At the end of the movie, he doesn't get the girl, but are we supposed to feel sorry for him because he is so screwed up?  This movie makes it very hard to tell.  He says that he is a vampire that prays on other's emotions at the beginning of the movie, and at the end he leaves campus in a very monstrous way.  But throughout the movie it is as if the directors and writers are trying to get the audience to like him, and then he screws up again.  I am someone who notoriously picks apart movies and makes sense of them for pretty much everyone I watch them with.... And this one, whew!  I also am only 24, lived the party life in college, love ""fear and loathing in las Vegas"", ""Boogie Nights"" (movies with substance), and still hold quite a liberal viewpoint on most issues. Its really disturbing that this movie could be released because I believe, like the movie ""Go"", it is totally expoiting teenagers vulnerabilities because they are so impressionable.  It is no wonder the Under18 group rated this movie higher that the over 18.  They think watching kids in college is cool no matter how they are acting or morally devoid their characters.  It is my belief that the directors and producer go after this genre intentionally because they know it will draw this particular influential audience.

It may not be evident to some, but it illustrates how someone's view (fantasy) about another can be strangely distorted. The characters don't really know each other but think they do and imagine relationships that don't exsist. I think this applies to all young people, like when you were in school and you had a crush on someone and thought they mabye felt something for you as well, but you found out they didn't even know who you were.

228,SnwBorder52,Film adaptation lacks depth. Overall quality low.,5,22 December 2006,"I saw The Rules of Attraction immediately after reading the book a week ago, and i was very disappointed. Expecting a ""Garden State"" or ""Stranger Than Fiction"" type of film, in the way the movie was shot, in the acting, soundtrack, etc, the movie turned out to be just sub-par.First, the script is a huge let down and changes dramatically from the book. Now this is not avoidable when books are made into movies, but the story, and more importantly what an audience takes away from its experience is different. For instance, in the book Lauren loses her virginity during her freshman year, prior to all her relationships, while in the movie it is not until her senior year, post the events in the movie. Also, the fact that Paul and Lauren both had relationships with Sean is left out, and, i believe the most important piece of information, the fact that *Big Book Spoiler* Lauren gets pregnant, and eventually has an abortion is left out*End Spoiler* Now normally this isn't a big deal, but since the book is so profound, these details are huge. A Large emphasis in the book is that relationships, and life, just move on. The Rules of Attraction as a book is just the middle of a story, it has a begging and an end in its own right, but the actual characters have no begging and no end in, it is just one section of their life put on paper.Also, Paul is still in love with Sean at the end of the movie, as well as Sean is still in love with Lauren, and so forth. In fact Paul's and Sean's relationship is over halfway through the book.All these descepances make the film have much less of an impact than the book, and I feel like rather then condensing to book to film form, the writers re-wrote the story, and did not do a good job of it.Other notes, the cinematography was OK, and it made it look like another Teen Movie. Same with the acting. There is a line that Paul says to Sean before Paul leaves to see his mother. He says ""I don't want you to go alone..."" to the party, that is, when hes really saying ""I don't want u to go alone because i don't trust you"". Although this can be conveyed in film, this sub-text, and others like it, are lost in the film.I still highly recommend the book, but don't expect to get a great deal of thought provoking themes in the movie, it is more for entertainment purposes, than to really inspire the audience.",The Rules of Attraction
229,snow_blind77,"""...and all that might have been.""",5,26 September 2009,"I can't say that I've read the book, but, to the movie's credit, it does give me an urge to go read it and further understand the subtleties of the the story. That however, is because the movie did a pretty lousy job at telling it right.The movie tries to capture the world of spoiled, upper-class American teenage promiscuity and shallowness, and along with it, the emptiness and randomness of human emotions. It goes off to a promising start, during a lengthy initial scene which introduces the three main characters.Shannyn Sossamon is more gorgeous than ever, and does a great job as the somewhat naive Lauren, Ian Somerhalder is quite believable as a young smart gay teenager coming to terms with his own sexuality, and Jessica Biel, Kate Bosworth, Clifton Collins Jr. and Faye Dunaway all make some memorable appearances, for the couple of minutes they actually show up on the screen.However, there are problems. Big problems.Characters never seem to have the chance to develop themselves. Numerous plot holes and the seemingly random turn of events never allow the viewer to relate to whatever is happening. Dialogue feels camp and forced, and the emotions are cheap right at the time when they aught to impress. There is absolutely no trace of any chemistry whatsoever between the cast members. The characters internal struggle and the way they relate to one-another are all badly portrayed, and never seem real. And why, for the love of God, why would you cast James van der Beek as an emotional vampire/teenage hunk ?! A few of the film's scenes do the movie some justice, and I can't help but feel a bit disappointed that this did not receive the time and attention it deserved in production. It feels rushed and stale.The story is promising, and pretty original. Bret Easton Ellis had something definitely going on in the book. But haphazard directing and a weak script meant that Roger Avery completely fumbled it.This is a movie about a bunch of undeveloped characters, wandering aimlessly in 100 min or so of weakly connected events and turns. Most of them feel like a walking-talking melange of clichés and stereotypes, just ripe for the superficial young American cinema-goer to dissect, and hopefully, ponder upon a bit.Some people might enjoy it despite all it's flaws, but I can't help but feel that with more time, careful planning and some corrections here and there, this could have turned much, much better, in true justice to the stellar cast.

I genuinely felt so sorry for Paul after so much rejection, and Sean as well. I just wanted so badly for everything to work out, but no one gets what they truly wanted in the end. The only part I don't like about this film is the suicide in the bathtub. I couldn't watch it the first time, and still cant this day. If I had to choose one reason why it is my favorite movie, it would be the atmosphere of total dissatisfaction that the whole movie just screams.

I guess that would have been a good thing to know before seeing this movie with friends who aren't quite done grieving for a friend... and to see such a similar event in this movie was horrible.  Now I'm not saying that it doesn't belong in the movie... in fact it did fit... I'm just saying that some people need to get more into their reviews than just... ""that was a cool movie"" or some variation there of.  I'm sure that many people enjoyed this movie, but if I had found a review that was a little more forth-coming, than I could've spared a number of my friends a discomfort that they did not need.  so... don't be mislead... this movie is good (I'm sure) if you're in the right mind-set for it, but it is NOT a movie for every one... it certainly wasn't for me!",The Rules of Attraction
234,bagggirl,"Very dark comedy from the writer of ""American Psycho"" and ""LessThan Zero""",10,26 September 2002,"I had the opportunity to attend an advanced screening of this film where Roger Avary spoke.  First off, this is a fantastic film.  That being said, let me delve a little deeper.  Although set on a college campus, this is Bret Easton Ellis, NOT National Lampoons.  Meaning, this film is not for the weak of heart.  It's a dark comedy that addresses sex and drugs very directly.  It's a great adaptation of the book, with only slight disappointing differences: mainly intimate relationships in the book have become near misses in the film.  But Roger Avary has taken the material and molded it successfully, as well as adding some fun film nuances, including moving backwards, split screen, and especially a great speedy montage of Kip Pardue traveling through Europe.  It's a great career move for James Van Der Beek who ditches his whiny Dawson character and carries the film with harsh ease.  Also great performances from virtual unknowns Ian Somerhalder and Russell Sams.   Highly suggested.",The Rules of Attraction
235,victoriaklynch,Best movie ever,10,13 June 2019,I love this movie! Reminds me of great times and college times too!! Absolute movie to watch to see a blast from the past for 90s kids!,The Rules of Attraction
236,Swanke25,This was a fantastic movie. It was well made and very entertaining.,8,2 May 2006,"""Rules of Attraction"" offers a twisted look into the lives of several college students at a fictional school, Camden College. Filled with illicit drug abuse, crazy sexual situations, and violence; it provides a candid look at the darker side of college life. This film never shows the kids going to class or work, but instead it takes place almost exclusively at parties. This movie is entertaining not only because of its provocative situations and characters but for overall quality as an artistic expression. ""Rules of Attraction"" is a well constructed piece that contains the necessities of a great film: an unpredictable storyline, complex characters, articulate cinematography. The main storyline revolves around a college student, Sean, who is womanizing drug dealer involved in a unique love triangle. Although may sound like something that's been over done, this triangle is little more complicated than that. Sean is in love with Lauren, who he believes is an innocent virgin sending him love letters, while Lauren's bisexual ex boyfriend is actively pursuing Sean as well. To make things even more complicated, Laura, Lauren's roommate is trying to get with Sean before Lauren has the chance. Lauren is holding out for another guy, Viktor, who through most of the movie is out sleeping with other girls while touring Europe. Each character is completely self involved and full of flaws creating chaos and despair for everyone involved. Combined with this complex situation, the plot twists, changes and offers sudden surprises I can't share without ruining the movie for those who intend on viewing it. By making the movie unpredictable it catches the audience off guard and keeps them paying close attention to detail, making a more entertaining movie experience. Each character is flawed and not really likable. The writer/director of the film, Roger Avery, portrays each character as they are. For some it may be hard to watch a film and be so detached from its characters, but it offers the most accurate portrayal of all their individual personalities. The best example of this is with Sean. He is consistently shown under low lighting and high angles to diminish his personality. James Van Der Beek plays his role flawlessly cold. His actions are self centered and somewhat emotionless making him impossible to feel sorry for. The use of cigarettes by the characters in the movie seems abundant. But this is not a pro smoking campaign, nor is it used simply to make the character look cool. By showing the characters smoking it is a more accurate portrayal of their drug filled lifestyle. Also it is an important part of characterization. Smoking is harmful to a person's health, showing the characters generally reckless behavior and carefree attitude toward life. These simple items enhance the way the audience looks at the characters and as a result, enhances the movie. Avery took a complicated storyline, twisted characters and combined them with excellent cinematography. He used lighting and music to change the tone from scene to scene. At one of the bleakest points in the movie it was dark, cold, snowing and had sad music. At a completely different part of the movie, two lovers are reunited by dancing in their underwear in a well lit, beautiful hotel room to the rock hit ""Faith"". Avery changed scenery, lighting and music to propel the emotions of the story and the characters maximizing their effectiveness and bring the emotions to life. His transitions form one scene to the next built continuity to the story. Since the storyline had multiple characters making decisions that changed or altered other characters actions, his transitions needed to have a similar effect, and they did. He used rewind and fast forward techniques to change his place in time and show the same event from a variety of perspectives. The opening scene takes place at the end of the movie and then starts over to explain how everything came to be. Many scenes show events happening in forward and reverse while through the eyes, and thoughts of different characters. While showing multiple perspectives, Avery used a series of vignettes and voice-overs to explain the thoughts of individual characters. These have been criticized for being annoying or pointless but they are in fact necessary to the movie. Each character is so corrupt that it is difficult for the audience to understand their actions. The personal narrations offer a look into the thoughts of individual and often their reasoning for their actions and attitudes. So many different elements where assembled to create a fantastic movie. The movie is not happy or inspiring but that was never its intent. The movie will shock you, surprise, possibly disgust you, and you'll love every minute of it.",The Rules of Attraction
237,rlemieux,Clever,9,24 November 2003,"This film first of all is obviously not for everyone.  Its a sort of in your face view of what really goes on at Universities these days.  My God having recently graduated from one I know all too well the truth to this film.  So, for all of you out there who say this is played up and fake, wake up.  The stress of college life is more than most people ever give it credit.  Kids drink too much, have too much sex, do drugs, and yes, even kill themselves.  The adjustment from the protection of mommy and daddy to the type of freedom college offers is something many can not adjust to.
James Van Der Beek is brilliant as the slightly deranged but somehow likeable drug dealing Sean Bateman.  His anger and liquor induced insanity are completely believable and shows that Van Der Beek is much more than Dawson Leary as an actor.  In fact though Dawson was a good role, this movie truly shows that Van Der Beek is one hell of an actor.
Its amusing to watch so many ""teen icon"" actors and actresses show some guts in a film like this.  Watching ""Kevin Arnold"" shoot up is something I will never forget.Ian Somerhanlder gives a very memorable performance as the awkward gay/bi person looking for love in ""all the wrong places"" if you will.  The performance like Van Der Beek's is excessively honest and true, and maybe that is why this film has left so many reviews empty or wishing for something else.The only drawback of this film would be some of the reverse camera action is not necessary and though used for stylistic reasons at times should or could have been left out.In summation, this is a real movie.  Its a movie watchers movie however so I must warn you.  Its intense at times and most certainly not another one of those predictable teen angst movies.  What you will see may disturb you but trust me it is fact on film.  Very good movie.  If you thought the movie ""clueless"" or Dude Where's my Car"" were masterpieces (though I did find them mildly entertaining would not list them with my all time top five) don't watch this, you will most likely not get it, but if you have an open mind and enjoy a film that is different from everything else in the video store check it out.",The Rules of Attraction

It could be seen as pretentious but that's the point. It's satirical and dark, poking fun at the superficial college life of rich people. That is the whole point and to label the film itself as being pretentious is absurd. It's very funny, it's filmed very well and the characters are fantastic, especially the one of Paul. The cameo Faye Dunaway is great as she is completely drunk.

James Van Der Beek does a phenomenal job as the leading role. Peripheral performances are notable as well. It will remind viewers of American Psycho because of how twisted the characters are. This film is very explicit in it's depiction of sex and relationships in college. A far cry from the character that Van Der Beek plays on TV. Will make many wonder why he hasn't gone on to more substantial, multi-dimensional roles in film. He is really not that bad of an actor it's just that many other actors are like him (McConahey, etc.).",The Rules of Attraction
244,klauslkp,the best ellis adaptation yet.,10,11 October 2002,"i read ""the rules of attraction back in june of 2002. i'm a big ellis fan, having read ""american psycho"" and ""glamorama"" - and when i found out that ROA was being made into a movie, i flipped out. for for about three or four months, i had been eagerly waiting for it to appear at my local cinema.there are two trailers for the film. the teaser is an homage to stanley kubrick's ""a clockwork orange"", which i liked alot. the second trailer is longer and is edited in a way that makes it seem like an mtv-produced teenager flick.quite the opposite. this film, in my opinion, is probably the best movie of the year. it really stayed true to bret easton eliss' novel, and it left out some parts, but it really changed nothing - except for the fact that the story is set in the mid-eighties and the film is set in present day.the music is used quite beautifully in this film...watch out for ""without you"" by harry nillson.",The Rules of Attraction

Your real life 'Lauren's' and 'Laura's' that watch this will deny and block out the fact that this is real life and your dreams don't always come true, just as the characters blocked out the reality of the situations in the film, and continued to cling to their failing ideals, even as it became obvious that things weren't as they percieved them to be.

246,digitaltaco,I hope I never have to see this film ever again...,1,12 October 2002,"If you happened to catch the Sundance Channel's ""Anatomy of A Scene,"" or even a preview for  ""the Rules of Attraction,"" you may think the film is a slightly quirky, somewhat humorous, college tale with a few clever filmic tricks thrown in for fun.  But, my friends, you have been misled...drastically.  What I saw at the theater was no less than one of the most grotesque pictures of youth culture (or even humanity in general) that I have been subjected to.  Every character you're introduced to in the film is disturbed and there is not one pure or good character that I could relate to.  The closest you'll come is in the gay man Paul, who, strangely, is obsessed with the drug-dealing, and downright evil Sean.  Well, I suppose Lauren has her good character traits, but when push comes to shove she's just as dirty. (She gives her professor a hummer for a higher grade.) She too is obsessed with Sean.Basically you've got a film where a bunch of rich kids have no morals, get completely trashed constantly and never once do anything even remotely positive.  The film is not funny.  And I can honestly say I didn't laugh once throughout this picture.  It's extremely long and feels like it should end at around 10 different places throughout the film.  Probably the best spot to end it would have been just after the suicide of one of Sean's other adoring fans.  Unfortunately, the scene is poorly done.  A similar, and far more beautiful and believable scene is present in ""the Royal Tenenbaums"" for those looking for a comparison.Oh, and those clever filmic tricks I was talking about... Yeah, those get laid on way, way too thick and feel very heavy. And unnecessary.  At some point they stop becoming clever and just become annoying.  Credits in reverse...whew, what a clever little trick.  Somebody give this guy an Oscar.After coming out of the film I was disgusted with humankind, and more specifically college age people, my own peers.  I haven't been this disgusted after a film since seeing ""Very Bad Things"" and ""the Doom Generation.""  If you're a fan of either of those two films, you should probably check out ""Rules.""  I don't know what's wrong with you, but... check it out.  The rest of you, realize what you're getting yourself into with this picture.  It's disgusting.

247,aroutakagou,Chronicles of a negative generation,9,1 January 2007,"As Fight Club or Virgin Suicides before (despite they're quite different), The Rules Of Attraction are a so-called anti-teen movie, like Roger Avary himself called it. The aim is clearly to describe the teen life in a realistic way, a lot better than American and co want to do. Here, the movie talks about the teenage generation, but also directly talks to it.So, we can welcome here with some smile James Van Der Beek, Mr Dawson, the ""father"" of the behavior of all these little girls ever dreaming of the charming prince. Helped by a whole rising generation of actors (Shannyn Sossamon, Ian Somerhalder, Jessica Biel and Kip Pardue, firstly), he clearly give a depth to his loser character, et give more credibility to a script that already had enough.But here, no charming prince. We start directly by a post-alcoholic defloration scene, trash, brutal. Simple and efficient. Then, we change character, the edition like a scratch with a disc, we come back, and we start again. And again, and again. Then, let's back one year before.But, the describing this movie can't be done without some speaks on the book, by Bret Easton Ellis, dealing with this new modern loneliness. By writing himself the adaptation, Avary underlines the complete lack of feelings and contacts between people, explicitly said by this ""you'll never know somebody"".With some simple scenes, and others much more emotional (the introduction, the ""end of the world"" party, the suicide...) for finally coming back to his starting point, it seems to remember us the daily routine and the boring life we're living, and that nothing and nobody can help us to fill, without a little understanding.A huge movie for a huge book, and a successful adaptation, proving by the way the Roger Avary's writer and filmmaker talent, and exploding all the dangerous teen movies trying to give us The little House on the Prairie by intravenous.",The Rules of Attraction
248,godforbid77,How can you say this movie is trash?,10,18 April 2007,"This movie is far from trash. It's the perfect portrayal of jaded, self-centered humans. You don't even need to read the novel. This movie is a stand-alone. The characters are the embodiment of our darkest sides. Indifference, pain and suffering are the same no matter how much money you have, where you are from, or whatever else you been through. these emotions are key in this film. These kids are the mass college youth at its finest (or worst) depending on how you look at it. It isn't overplayed but most of these kids are on so much coke I'm surprised they could think straight, much less attend class. The ""gimmick"" of reversing the scenes to revert to another characters point of view isn't overplayed. The intros for the characters are a nice touch, and in my opinion, help flesh out these people so much that I thought I was looking at ""johnny"" that lives down the street. It seems to me that the end and the trailers are why this film gets hated on so much. The trailers are totally misleading and the end, well, just seems to make people angry. And yeah these kids seem like brats, but let's face it, most of the kids that go to schools of ""higher education"" are. If you look a little deeper I think you'll find a lot of symbolism in this. This is definitely a film for people who notice the things in life which most people don't. Like the sign on Victor's door when he gets back from Europe and Lauren pays him a visit. He is the purity and sanctity that she wants to loose her virginity to, while Sean is the devil himself. Yet Sean, as twisted as he may seem, actually cares for her. He's just an idiot when it comes to showing it and he makes some really bad choices. But anyway if you notice on the door the sign says ""The test came back positive! Be careful!"" and Victor doesn't even know who she is. And her ""best friend"" Lara pops up in the background in lingerie ready to be his flavor of the night. There is no way in my mind that anyone could reference this film as garbage, unless they haven't experienced these darker sides. I've had similar experiences in my life that this movie adds the deepest waves of color to. In closing the point to me is follow your heart and your head,not your loins, or the words of your drugged-out, so-called friends. Pay attention to the little things and life will be sweet.

Anyone who does not like this film is too old and removed from the college/university lifestyle to understand the dark humor in the movie.

Selfish pursuit of immediate gratification and pleasure does not equal happiness, something that is a very difficult lesson to learn as an affluent college student.If you haven't already go see this movie and don't be afraid to laugh at the jokes.",The Rules of Attraction

I'm afraid some people might miss it because of the misleading trailer.Having read Bret Easton Ellis's book ""American Psycho,"" I knew this movie (based on another of his novels) would be dark and just as twisted as the life of Patrick Bateman (the lead in American Psycho).  This movie, Rules of Attraction, revolves around the life of Bateman's younger brother, Sean, and all the misunderstandings of college love and obsession.

Sometimes the movie turns on a comedy,sometimes it´s dramatic,but always makes you stay at your seat thinking about the next thing you´ll see. For technical aspects, i have to say it´s the first time i see the use of rewinding the camera for getting a different point of view,from another person that was in the scene and you havent´t noticed. You can also feel some Pulp Fiction ""deja  vou"" in the writing credits,that makes you think that Roger Avary had more importance in Tarantino´s movie that you had thaught.Think that some part of the actual youth is reflected in this film:drugs,sex,materialism,the constant need-of-funny...Sometimes it makes you feel well,sometimes not,but...who said that reality is always good for us???My vote is 8 of 10",The Rules of Attraction

On the other hand it had several things that bothered me.  First of all, if this film was intended to shock people, it did a miserable job of it.  It was about as shocking as some PG rated films I have seen in the past.  People having sex and doing drugs, very shocking.  Also, the film to me didn't seem to be in touch with any sort of reality.  And this comes from someone who has lived the college life.  I think the problem was that the film was based on a book written in the 80s and yet took place in the modern day.  Or maybe it's because I'm from the midwest and the movie takes place in the northeast,a region I haven't frequented, I don't know.I ended up not liking this movie because the negatives outweigh the positives.

Worst of all is the suicide girl is totally revealed who it is at the start whereas in my original version (original to me because it is the first version I saw of it) you do not know till she commits suicide and it makes it so much more poignant (spelt wrong) because it shows how people are there and you don't even notice.

Avary makes this film fit into a dozen types of film, a satire, drama, black comedy, romance just to name a few.
James Van Der Beek(Varsity blues, standing still) plays a campus drug dealer Sean Bateman( brother of Patrick Bateman from American Psycho)who falls for the innocent virgin Lauren Hynde(Shannyn Sossamon)who is still in love with her ex Victor(Kip Pardue) who is on a trip across Europe getting high every night. Of course nothing turns out how its supposed to be which is the best part about this movie, it's not predictable nor a stupid little teen flick.This movie is a serious film for anyone who wants to watch real actors and actresses playing their parts.

282,msiler111,"If you didn't like it, you probably didn't understand it.",10,4 March 2012,"The most commonly used phrase by critics to describe this film: incredibly shallow. The reality: insightful. To understand the film, you must first understand the novel. Bret Easton Ellis penned this novel as a first rate attack on the empty social circus that he considered ""Camden College"" to be. It is deceptively effective in showing us a variety of empty suits in the form of college kids attempting to live existentially. That being said, the movie is a scene for scene deconstruction of the malevolence, hedonism, and fatalism of the mindset of a 20 something college kid. Before you blast the characters as vapid or social parasites (emotional vampires if you are Sean Bateman), you must first recognize that there is no true protagonist with which you should identify (except perhaps the suicide, she might actually be the true protagonist). Paul Denton might be the closest. But he has his own pitfalls in personality as well. The film itself is all encompassing and omniscient. At times very Rashomon, and at others very DePalma. The sequence of events that bring everyone together take place in the form of apocalyptic parties (Ie End of the World Party, Dress to Get Screwed Party). These parties act as the setting for all kinds of childish things. For instance Laura begins her story with a long soliloquy as we watch her lose her viginity to a townie while a friend films it. This virginity is very important to her pathos as we realize she has placed significant importance to it and we must mourn this loss, because it was the last relevant piece of dignity she had as an innocent. So as we watch Sean Bateman declare his love to her at the end, she has become jaded and shoots him hate ""You love me. You don't even know what that means."" The finale of the film is meant to serve as an inspiration for catharsis for all of the characters. Some take it (Paul and Laura) some don't (Sean). But the point of the entire film is that it is satire meant to illuminate the absurd existential realities of the 21 year old mindset. These college days are not as all-encompassing or important as the characters think, they are merely acts that help inspire each character to realize that the gravitas of youth is not the most important thing in life. The film is engaging and important if you watch it with an eye for the subtle nuances of the satire. If you understand that none of these characters has redeeming value, you begin to grasp the absolute magic of the satire of the college culture. You go to college trying to be an adult and through the ugly absurdities you can either gain knowledge from them or you can speed off into the night on a motorcycle running away from the staunch reality you have denied. As to the film itself, the editing was fantastic, sound loops from previous sequences reappear in the background in later scenes. The cinematography is topnotch and engaging, each character has a cinematic style and the style adapts as the character grows. The soundtrack is fantastic, especially during the hauntingbathtub scene as we listen to Harry Nilson's ""Without You"" whilst we view a suicide that is by all means completely unnecessary and tragic. The character of Sean Bateman is skillfully played by James Van Der Beek, who is basically chasing his hedonism to dangerous extremes. I can't understand why people wouldn't love this film. Unless of course they didn't remove themselves from it and think about it. Roger Avary put the words of Bret Easton Ellis on film and told a tale far more socially adept than American Psycho. It's much closer to the novel than the American Psycho adaptation. Maybe that's why people don't love it. You really can't love Bret Easton Ellis, unless you distance yourself from his characters. This is the perfect college film.",The Rules of Attraction

I am very intrigued by the film and its characters, but I am left with wanting more from the film when it closes. The scene when Paul and his friends bring the freshman to the ER is very confusing. What was the story with the doctor? What are the implications of the scene? Whats the deal with laptops and streaming porn downloads in the mid 1980s? Late 1990s Mercedes that Van Der Beek drives is also a time period error. These things are disappointing. Also, Van Der Beek sings a Counting Crows song to Kate Bosworth, and i think he actually tells her it was a crows song! That is a HUGE flaw. Eric Stoltz is the forever partying professor that sleeps in his office with Roach clips on his desk?

To understand this movie takes a bit more that just watching it. You have to understand the characters, the people. Avery did an excellent job taking Ellis' characters and placing them into the film.

But after the forwards-backwards time-flow at the beginning and the first few dialogues, I quickly changed my mind. The beginning of the movie is as close to the novel as it could be.I agree that one who hasn't read any of Ellis' novels might find the characters one-dimensional and the plot (i.e. what happens to the characters and what they do) pointless... but... that was exactly Ellis' intention. All his novels are about the emptiness that people find in themselves when they spend their lifes and money on absolutely cursorily relationships, drugs, partys, and fake friends. They waste the happiest time in their lifes by living their lifes to the full. There's absolutely nothing inside them what would make a person interesting to me. To me, all his other characters seemed more frightening than Pat Bateman, the serial killer in ""American Psycho"", because they've got all they could ever want but still have nothing to loose. It's their sheer negation of any form of human or social or emotional values that makes them scary to me. How hard they may try and how much they really love each other in this hetero/bi/homo-clique, their endeavours will never succeed.And I have never before seen a film based on a novel that catched the exact meaning of a book so well. It's almost like the pictures I got in my head during reading.So far I agree with Frank who posted before me, I only disagree that ""The Rules of Attraction"" was Ellis' first novel... His first novel was ""Below Zero"" which has also been adapted to film.

Rules of Attraction was not marketed as a teen comedy in this country, actually I read that it is rather a sad and gloomy film about problems of misunderstanding and disillusionment, in which the notions of sex and love are opposed to each other. Well, i haven't read any books by Bret Easton Ellis - actually of all his books only American Psycho has been published in Russian, and this is the first movie by Rogar Avary I've seen so I cant compare this movie to any of their previous works. I think that Avary is a very talented director and wish he had made more films. Rules of Attraction (the title was inappropriately translated into Russian as PRAVILA SEKSA - the Rules Of Sex)is one of the most moving and profound films I've seen recently. Though positioned as a comedy it sometimes acquires tragic feeling especially in the scene of the suicide and when Sean talks to Lauren and then to Paul on the theater stage. I agree that Rules of Attraction may and even will eventually become a cult movie as well as Fight Club and Donnie Darko which were underrated at first too. The soundtrack is great too - i believe this is not the first time an American movie is packed with tunes from English bands .

292,amandalynn125,I want my two hours back,1,3 June 2005,"This is the most horrible movie I've ever seen, and I've sat through both Ishtar and all three of the Dead Gentleman films. I had to watch this movie for a research project and got it for free through an interlibrary loan program, but this movie wasn't worth the five seconds it took me to track it down in WorldCat, let alone the four hours (I had to watch Ian Somerhalder's commentary track as well) I spent watching it. The visuals are impressive, I'll admit that, but the lack of any kind of redeeming story quality killed it for me. The voiceovers and even much of the dialogue (what little there is once the lines containing only expletives are discounted) is stilted and unrealistic and does not flow nearly as well as a writer like Kevin Smith's or even Kevin Williamson's. Not to mention that anyone who's seen both Less Than Zero and American Psycho has already seen this entire movie, only with different set pieces. James Van Der Beek is no Christian Bale or Robert Downey Jr., and only the cameo characters (Fred Savage, Jay Baruchel, Faye Dunaway, Eric Stoltz) are even remotely entertaining. The rest of the characters I just wanted to punch repeatedly every time they appeared on screen. Everything is overdone to the point of exhaustion, from the backwards-running film to the maniacal laughter of Sean as he finally falls over the edge after the ""battle"" at Rupert's house. Of the principal actors, Shannon Sossamyn is dishrag-bland; Van Der Beek is trying so hard to be ""edgy"" that you can see his neck veins bulging; Jessica Biel actually does a good job with her character,it's just too bad her character is despicably irredeemable; and Ian Somerhalder is great--until you realize he's just ripping off Tom Cruise in Risky Business. Somerhalder also needs to just shut his @#$%^& mouth already about the gay thing. It's not like it's hurt Ewan McGregor or Jonathan Rhys Meyers any.I'm not totally made of stone--I did laugh at Van Der Beek wanking off to ""Afternoon Delight"" and Somerhalder humping his reflection in the mirror.

293,hoda_man1,Beginnings and Endings,8,1 November 2014,"SPOILERS - tread carefully before reading. :)OK so, a lot of people have posted that the movie seemed rather ""superficial"" and unclear. So I wanted to share my thoughts. I was wondering if people saw it the way that I did. Clearly the movie was sequenced differently purposefully, I gather because we are to presume that all the characters eventually get their ""happy ending"". I mean, the beginning of the movie starts from the end and all the way back up. Not all beginnings begin well obviously, like a journey. Now the ending was interesting ... because it cuts off ... alluding to something Sean should be ""thinking"" of or that he is forgetting. Or that he is trying to remember. I'm going to segue now to something I found rather interesting that, with Paul and Lauren, we got to see a resolution for the people they were ill fated with. We didn't necessary get one for Sean and Kelly. And its interesting too that when they meet, they use the terms ""thinking"" (Sean says ""Why not"" in response) in their dialog. And when they are done having sex, he goes, he can't ""remember"" the last time he had done the deed while ""sober'. And being drunk is a lot like forgetting, no? And when the movie ends too, I feel that ""we"" as the audience forget about Kelly and her fate, unlike the fates of the other victims Paul and Lauren face that end up fine. One becomes a popular Queer, the other married successfully with 4 children So I'd like to presume then that, though Sean's fate has begun in a wrong direction (much like the other characters), his ending is that he ends with with Kelly. The Beginning is a lot like clues for his ""happy ending"" in my opinion, like we get to hear about the endings of all the other people we are told from the beginning sequence. And I believe Paul and Lauren end up together. They were wearing matching clothes, signaling that they are a match towards the end of the movie. Even Lauren acknowledges a ""US"" that they are the same. I mean, Paul duality being that his bisexuality wasn't getting him anywhere, may propel him to seek companionship with a straight woman. That was his problem. He kept pursuing men to no avail and they were all a disaster. Much like Lauren, pursuing someone she couldn't have. She was also pursuing Sean, which is a bit of a duality going on in her life too (between two people, two worlds). So the lesson here is that, they had to be more selective and in a sense, bridge their duality to find each other I feel and become whole as ""One"" which I feel they find in each other. That's their happy ending. Now I don't understand ""suicide girls"" fate in this movie and her ending. End of her pain? She's in heaven and free? lol I don't know. Maybe she is a symbolism of death and all things starting anew. I just feel like her story isn't finished or perhaps I'm not seeing it so clear. I suppose she was pursuing a ""dream"" much like Sean was following the letters of a person we find out later was actually a secret admirer (not Lauren). Maybe Sean goes off to commit suicide after the credits and we are to assume he ends up reunited with her, in some alternative reality. ""Suicide girl"" also makes me think about the entire theme of the movie too, about fate and not being about to change it. I mean, the title of the movie is ""Rules"" of attraction after all, as in, certain things you need to abide by or things that are unwilling to bend. Even Paul makes this point, that no matter what you do, everything ends up the way they are supposed to. So ""Suicide Girl"" taking her life, from her own will, makes it seem that perhaps even some rules can be bent when it comes to the affections of the heart. Or that there are no rules at all to love. Or that, maybe no matter how bad things get, it will all be OK at the end since they are no rules. Since rules have consequences, and though their actions had some pretty bad repercussions and effects, I feel the movie alludes to them all having a ""happy ending"" as I've speculated above and to their clues. I might be wrong, but I feel this movie sends quite a strong message actually.",The Rules of Attraction
294,silver_back_9772,"Great, details the dark side of college life",10,18 June 2005,"This movie details the less glorified aspects of college life , it deals with unhealthy habits,obsessions and loves. The Movie is updated from Brett Easton Eliss' novel, which takes place in the seventies. The movie is however set in the late nineties.It captures the essence of the novel brilliantly and is a definite must see movie. The movie does so much while doing so little, making it so appealing. Each characters story is told with integrity and detail.The subtle differences between each characters viewpoint and experiences throughout the college is great and makes for a textured and layered film. Each character has a disenchanted feel which suits the subtle subdued movie. Star performances by James Van Der Beek and Ian Somerhalder bring integrity to a movie that could have been a disaster, because of its updated time period",The Rules of Attraction
295,Lilmandy_5,sex drugs and rock and roll,10,28 September 2005,"First of all let me just say that I didn't think this movie would be anything special, or something that I would like but I was wrong. So if you and any of your friends haven't seen this movie please do;and it probably help you understand better if you read the book first. I didn't like that fact that some issues in this movie were serious but made in funny ways I kind of don't like dark comedy. The acting was very very good and I enjoyed it, as for the way that movie is told I kind of understood but sometimes I got lost. THe descriptive words used to describe the people and the situations were sometimes words I haven't heard of before.",The Rules of Attraction
296,geismarbowman,WORST movie I've ever seen,1,19 November 2005,"I actually registered with IMDb just so I could warn other people never to waste their time seeing the worst movie ever. You could probably figure it out just by looking at the cast -- anything that purports to be a serious movie and stars Dawson, Jessica Biel, and that girl from that other horrible movie 40 Days and 40 Nights, has to be horrible. In addition to the awful acting, the movie has idiotic dialog, unbelievable settings and supporting characters, and silly and tired cinematographic tricks (running the film backwards, ooh). They also use a lot of gore, sexual explicitness, bathroom scenes and even a grisly suicide (because that's not at all overdone) for cheap shock value. The whole time you're watching this ""gritty,"" ""edgy"" movie, you just can't get over the fact that Dawson looks like an idiot when he tries to sneer and look evil and that the sunny, sitcom-style lighting doesn't do much to help you feel like you are watching some depraved plot unfold (and the lighting isn't played up enough to make it an ironic contrast to the subject matter, it's just obviously somebody's poor judgment). Seriously, I wish I'd never seen this. I saw it last night and I'm still irritated about it.",The Rules of Attraction
297,Noora-Bruun,nice Friday night comedy,6,17 February 2006,"The alternative name ""The Rules of Attraction"" (2000) has in some countries, ""F*** the Rules"", tells better what the movie is about. It tells the stories of three college students, Sean (played by Dawson's Creek star James Van Der Beek), Paul (Ian Somerhalder, one of the countless faces in ""Lost"" but also starred in a better-suited role in 90's drama ""Young Americans"") and Lauren (Shannyn Sossamon).The movie in itself doesn't seem to have one red thread or a concrete plot but is more bits and pieces from lives of students and how they all are connected. This kind of ""moments in life""- genre has lately become very popular, and for a good reason. Many times portraying moments and thoughts instead of carrying on with the plot is worthwhile, just take a look at Sophie Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"".But then in some cases you're just waiting for the movie to start. Until the credits start to run and you realise it was just one long introduction.Basically, Paul is gay and fancies Sean. Sean is a drug-dealer student with nothing but women and pot on his mind. Lauren is a very sweet girl until she gets all obsessed with losing her virginity and gives a blow-job to her tutor. Girls are pretty, boys are baseball team captains and the main star gets beaten with a baseball bat because he couldn't pay for the drugs.The movie has its good moments though, quotes like 'I must insist you bring back the corpse so I can do tests on it!"" and ""I only f***ed her because I'm in love with you!"" (not connected in any twisted way..) are very good situation comedy and do work. Plus who could resist Ian Somerhalder's rising eyebrow's and fancy dancing, he truly did stay in mind the longest. That guy should get better roles. Or a Young Americans spin-off, as long as it gets off better than that infamous ""Friends""- spin- off ""Joey""..All in all, it's one of these movies you watch with your mates, laugh at the funny parts and... Laugh at the funny parts. And then forget it. Perfect Friday night film. 6/10.",The Rules of Attraction
298,bolvede-1,Book beats movie.... again,4,13 September 2006,"Rules of attraction is basically a story about love and dealing with attraction to others. The main characters are Sean, Paul and Lauren, which all end up in a kind of triangle-drama. The movie is rather experimental in the way it's directed: short scenes, rewinding time and so on. I truly like the experimental aspect of the movie but that's far from enough. The movie in itself has a very rambling story and it's hard to understand the subtext if you're not previously familiar with the characters and their bonds. I've recently read the book which the movie is based upon, Rules of attraction by Bret Easton Ellis. I loved the book and it's therefore so sad to see this movie. The movie seems to be made from 20 pages of the book. In the movie, the characters are scrambled and re-molded, the story makes no sense and there is not a single bit of the sarcasm and the apathy from the book left, which is really sad. Soo, to sum up: SKIP the movie, READ the book.",The Rules of Attraction
