0,TheLittleSongbird,"Technically impressive, but the story left me cold.",5,28 May 2009,"Briefly summarising, it is technically impressive, with excellent special effects, and the acting ranges from adequate to good. Keanu Reeves, an actor I don't care for that much, acquits himself well as Klaatu, but Jennifer Connelly came across as rather lifeless and unconvincing. The real star is Jaden Smith as Jacob, he gave some much-needed emotion, which is more than could be said with his adult co-stars. There is some nice support from Kathy Bates, but John Cleese had literally nothing to work with, and came across as useless. On the other hand, a number of factors let the film down, namely the lack of a story, and when there was, it plodded quite badly in the latter half. It starts off well, with a fantastic idea, but in the end it seems a shamble of underdeveloped characters, and the special effects disallowed the story to develop properly. The script was also uneven, and was further disadvantaged by some overly sentimental scenes that strayed away too often from the film's focus. All in all, technically impressive, with variable acting, but at the end of the day, compared to the superior original, you are just left wanting more. 4.5/10 Bethany Cox.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
1,bkoganbing,Like an old testament prophet,6,27 February 2019,"Watching this remake of The Day The Earth Stood Still reminded me of how Q in
the opening episode of Star Trek The Next Generation was ready to condemn
humanity out of hand. But at least John DeLancie was saying this far you've gone
and no farther. Here like an old testament prophet Keanu Reeves has come to
render final judgment on humanity and how it is messed up the gift of planet
earth.Keanu Reeves was certainly different than Michael Rennie in his interpretation
of alien Klaatu. He's more like Fredric March in Death Takes A Holiday, the
handsome young stranger who brings a promise of destruction. Rennie was a
sophisticated kind of actor and brought that quality to his performance. In
his version he does mix and mingle with humanity and does save us from the
big robot.The robot here is about the size of the Statue Of Liberty much bigger than the
1951 film. His arsenal is mighty and in the climax, positively biblical.I do prefer the 1951 film, but this one is not as bad as folks make it out to be.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
2,Leofwine_draca,Remake on autopilot,3,27 August 2011,"I'm a big fan of the science fiction genre, and 1951's THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is one of the granddaddies of that genre. It's a thought-provoking movie that still holds up today, so why anybody thought that remaking it as an overblown CGI extravaganza was a good idea is beyond me. Initially, this version is quite interesting, and my expectations were running high as to how filmmakers would adapt the story for modern audiences. Then, at around a third of the running time in, it falls apart, and we're left with a mix of bland dialogue scenes and soulless CGI set-pieces.It's hard to know what's more embarrassing about this production: the cartoonish Gort, who's never a patch on 1951's man-in-a-suit, or the lumbering, save-the-planet trite talk. Keanu Reeves is difficult to fault here: after all, he isn't required to do much other than look moody, which he's good at. However, the rest of the cast are either saddled with dull characters or give poor performances (and in the case of Jaden Smith, whose mere presence shrieks nepotism, it's both). Jennifer Connelly, decent in recent fare like BLOOD DIAMOND, plays a crushing bore with zero characterisation, while Kathy Bates is an awful caricature. Difficult to believe this is the same actress who played Annie Wilkes.The film becomes increasingly poor as it goes on, and if the fate of mankind really hinges on the presence of a bratty kid and his 'bonding' with an alien then I despair. There are scenes of destruction that look like something out of the latest Roland Emmerich monstrosity and an alien spaceship that looks like nothing more than an oversize version of the bouncy balls I used to play with as a kid. Remind me why I should care?",The Day the Earth Stood Still
3,SnoopyStyle,Lost in the Remake,6,24 February 2014,"In 1928, an explorer (Keanu Reeves) encounters an alien sphere on top of the Karakoram Mountains in India. Then today, an alien sphere lands in Central Park. Dr. Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) is an extreme environment biologist collected as part of the Crisis Respond Team. Emerging from the sphere, Klaatu (Reeves) is shot. He is injured and taken prisoner by Regina Jackson (Kathy Bates) the Secretary of Defense. Helen helps him escape with her bratty and defiant step son Jacob (Jaden Smith).Keanu Reeves is wooden. Jennifer Connelly is good. Kathy Bates is completely wrong. Jaden is an unlikeable brat and over acts. And where is the president in all of this? This is a remake of the 1951 sci-fi classic. Lots of money has been injected to try to make this an action adventure. Along the way, it loses something in the translation. It's a thought provoking sci-fi that tries to be something that it isn't.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
4,Hitchcoc,With a Whimper!,2,20 March 2010,"This is a sadly inept movie. It gets my usual comment. Let's see you had millions of dollars, some wonderful actors, and incredible technology. Do you think you could have found a story to use to make use of it. The two leads are incapable of anything interesting. He is totally confused and hesitant; she is full of emotions one moment and cold science the next; heroic one moment and incompetent the next. When the kid is crossing the river, Klatuu should have pushed him in. His character is about as unlikeable as one can be. This film started out well. I was really engaged. But then it got into the same old lack of imagination. If the military is like that portrayed on the screen in these movies, we can kiss out butts goodbye. What if that guy coming out of the ship was just a guy flying a new aircraft. Of course, blow him away now; don't ask any questions. I love science fiction and it's so sad that when given an opportunity to do something with a cool situation, we get this big budget bust. For heaven's sake, see the original from 1951.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
5,Prismark10,The Day the Earth Stood Still,5,14 October 2019,"The Day the Earth Stood Still is a great movie. The 1951 original that is.This could had been a good movie if the story was not so disjointed. If the script was not so cliched and if they got rid off the annoying kid.The US government summons a group of scientists in secret. An object from outer space is approaching the planet. In fact a sphere lands in New York and an alien Klaatu (Keanu Reeves) emerges who takes on human form.Klaatu wants to talk to the world leaders about the human destruction of the planet. The US Secretary of Defence views him as a threat and wants him interrogated at a secure facility.Dr Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) helps Klaatu escape and when she learns the true nature of his visit, she wants him to understand humanity.Michael Rennie gave a wonderful performance in the original movie which had a message of peace. Reeves seems to be inspired by Jeff Bridges alien from Starman as the remake highlights the issue of environmental destruction.

6,claudio_carvalho,"Annoying, Corny and Silly Remake of a Classic – A Heresy!",3,12 April 2009,"When a sphere from outer space lands in the Central Park in Manhattan, a group of scientists are summoned by the American government under the call of the Secretary of Defense Regina Jackson (Kathy Bates). The reborn alien form Klaatu (Keanu Reeves) is brought to a military facility and Dr. Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) decides to help him to escape and becomes the only chance to save the mankind from destruction.The original 1951 ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is one of the brightest science-fiction movies ever, with a very simple story and a wonderful message of peace. This annoying, corny and silly remake is a heresy and destroys everything good of the original movie, privileging the special effects and forgetting the essence of Robert Wise's version – how predatory the human race is. The arrogance of Kathy Bates's character, Secretary of Defense Regina Jackson, reflects the ""diplomacy"" of the present days and is ridiculous. The awful Afro-American Jaden Smith is annoying and totally miscast as the unbearable and overbearing stepson of the gorgeous Caucasian Jennifer Connelly. Unfortunately there are many short-minded producers in Hollywood that insists in remaking and destroying classics and other great movies. In times of worldwide ecological concerns and intolerance and great special effects, the obscure director Scott Derrickson and the unknown writer David Scarpa lost the chance of making an updated remake exploring these themes. The excellent Keanu Reeves and Jennifer Connelly have good performances wasted in this stupid version. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""O Dia em Que a Terra Parou"" (""The Day the Earth Stood Still"")",The Day the Earth Stood Still
7,kosmasp,Overall and something little,3,11 August 2009,"While I was worried about the casting choice of Keanu Reeves in the movie, in the end it seemed someone else was the real Achilles heel. More on that in the next paragraph. Back to Keanu and his role. His character does not challenge him too much, acting-wise that is. Jennifer Connely gets to aid him, but both of them get let down by the script.There are so many plot holes, character holes and unexplainable mood changes, that would make Michael Bay proud. Seriously though, while any Michael Bay movie has a certain entertainment value, the message that is delivered here, makes it all even more unbearable. The icing on the (bad) cake is the child (performance). So annoying that you wonder, why and how he could make people (or other creatures for that matter) change their mind, in a positive sort of way ...I liked the directors previous effort (Exorcism of Emily Rose), but this one just has a good basic idea ... execution wise - very bad. I'm seeing what he's trying to achieve, unfortunately he fails convincing (actors fail too).",The Day the Earth Stood Still
8,classicsoncall,"""I came to save the Earth"".",8,1 November 2010,"I was expecting to come away totally negative on this film, especially since the 1951 original is one of my personal Top Ten favorites. Though a lot of the original material is maintained and expanded upon, the feeling I got wasn't so much that this was a remake, but more of a sequel to the earlier picture. That's because when the 1951 film ended, one's take away is that maybe, just maybe, citizens of Earth would take heed of Klaatu's warning and reverse course on the path to Armageddon. Back in the Fifties, it seemed that the U.S. and Russia were on a trajectory to annihilate each other via nuclear war. My own view, relative to the first film, was that Man would never 'get it', and the prospect of Klaatu taking matters into his own hands, would eventually have to come back and fulfill his doomsday prophecy.In a way, that's where this picture begins. Klaatu (Keanu Reeves) has returned, and it's with a goal to complete the mission begun almost sixty years earlier. That actually might have been the better stated approach from the get-go instead of going the remake route. This time around, Klaatu isn't so willing to learn about and understand human behavior the way Michael Rennie's character was. He already KNOWS that humans are so dysfunctional in the way their nations, religions and races behave, that they don't WANT to change. This seems to be at the core of the film, and the repeated promises to do so by Jennifer Connelly's character seem hollow at best.That's why the resolution of the film seems so empty. Klaatu's decision to intervene on behalf of humanity is based on the singular reaction he has to the family dynamic between Helen Benson (Connelly) and her adopted son (Jaden Smith). Seriously, what analytically minded alien would possibly be swayed on that basis? What if, for example, Klaatu had sat in unobserved on your typical United Nations meeting? Or had observed the nuclear buildup of a country like Iran threatening to bring the world to the brink as it surely will in a few short years? Or the way despots the world over live like kings while their people barely survive in abject poverty.I guess in my version of ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"", Klaatu would have snapped his fingers and brought the world to a halt the way he did in both films, but do it permanently. You want to get serious about peace in our time and save the planet - then you make it impossible for one country or it's leader to inflict their will on another. Or, alternatively, you just wipe out the entire human race. But there's no box office with that alternative, so we're left with the less than satisfying finale.All that's not to say I didn't find some positives with the picture. I liked the concept of Klaatu being composed of three different organisms, and the acronym of GORT referring to a Genetically Organized Robotic Technology. Quite honestly, I'm relieved the picture didn't take the approach of trying to outdo it's contemporaries in the over the top action department, relegating those instances to showcasing Klaatu and Gort's power in a more strategic way.For all that though, one has to look at Professor Barnhardt's (John Cleese) admonition with some suspicion. It may be true that ""At the precipice, we change"". The only problem with that is - ""A few weeks later, we forget"".",The Day the Earth Stood Still
9,jboothmillard,The Day the Earth Stood Still,4,9 May 2009,"From director Scott Derrickson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose), I knew a remake of a classic film could be a mistake, I just wanted to see how much of a mistake. Many scientists, including Dr. Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) are brought to see something come to Earth, and giant shiny alien sphere (instead of a flying saucer) lands in Central Park in Manhattan. This alien turns into a human named Klaatu (Keanu Reeves), and he is adamant to see all the world's leaders to give them a warning, but Secretary of Defence Regina Jackson (Kathy Bates) isn't going to let him go. He manages to escape, and Helen wants to help him in his mission to save Earth, ultimately it is the human race destroying Earth themselves, and the sphere may release something to destroy everything causing destruction. Meanwhile, scientists are trying to find out more about the giant robot Klaatu landed with, which they name GORT (Genetically Organized Robotic Technology). In the end, Klaatu can't face all human being killed, and he may be the only thing that can stop the destructive gust of microscopic alien insects, and Helen convinces him the human race could change their ways. Also starring Jaden Smith (Will's son) as Jacob Benson, John Cleese as Professor Barnhardt, Jon Hamm as Michael Granier, J.C. MacKenzie as Grossman, Mousa Kraish as Yusef, Hiro Kanagawa as Dr. Ikegawa and Sunita Prasad as Rouhani. The special effects are pretty good, but the story with some added material, a changed format, Keanu Reeves being moody and not friendly like Michael Rennie, and of course, missing the catchphrase ""Klaatu Barada Nikto!"", this is nowhere near as good as the original. It was nominated the Razzie for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel. Okay!",The Day the Earth Stood Still
10,ccthemovieman-1,The Kid's Not Alright,3,24 April 2009,"Can one little kid ruin a movie? Yup.Think I'm exaggerating? Watch this film. You can see Exhibit A of it right here in this science-fiction ""classic"" film, a re-make of the 1950s hit movie of the same title. This re-make actually would have only ""bad"" without inserting this annoying kid, but he made it ""horrendous."" Jaden Smith as ""Jacob Benson"" is a spoiled, chip-on-his-shoulder, disrespectful kid who incessantly talks back to his mother, who puts up with it - which is equally annoying for most audiences. What was the purpose of inserting this kid in the film? What were the writers thinking? I'm glad to see a number of reviewers here agree with me on this one. I guess if you're the son of a famous actor (Will Smith), they'll insert you in film roles, even if there is no purpose to it. And Hollywood wonders why people don't go to the movies much any more, and they sneer at pitiful re-makes? Meanwhile, Keanu Reeves was a good choice for his starring role: an emotionless robot-like alien. Reeves is such a wooden-sounding actor to begin with that playing a bland robot is good casting for him. ""Klaatu"" is tailor-made for him.Comedy was provided via the ludicrous environmental fear-mongering message in here. I laughed out loud in several spots when ""Klaatu"" explained to us the reason for his mission. It's so stupid, it's laughable. I was reminded of Ed Wood's horrible sci-fi stories in the 1950s.I will say some of the special-effects and the surround sound in here is excellent. It was the highlight of the movie. These are good visuals and good audio, and a nice film to view on Blu-Ray. Unfortunately, the story got in the way.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
11,rmax304823,Blockbuster.,2,26 December 2009,"Why do they do it? Why do they take a modest classic like the 1951 ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and turn it into a hypermanic attempt at an epic by draining it of all its original phantasmic charm and replacing it with action and cheap emotion? The question is rhetorical. They do it for the money.This monstrosity must have cost the budget of the black-and-white original to the power of 10. It's vast and full of ghoulish colors. The sound makes one's house pulsate with the rhythm of doom. The acting resembles no human behavior that we've ever witnessed. It's based on the 1951 screenplay by Edmund H. North in the same way that methane is based on a herd of cows.It's hard to think of a reason to go on with a review. I mean, how do you review a compost heap? Well, in the original, Klaatu (Michael Rennie) walks out of his flying-saucer space ship and is shot in the shoulder. He's taken to a hospital and, once removed from his space suit, is entirely human. Here Klaatu (Keanu Reeves, who has shown himself capable of almost reaching the levels of animation of an animatronic figure in Disneyland's Hall of Presidents) emerges from his monster-sized medicine ball of a space ship as a glowing light source. When he's shot and taken to the hospital, he must shed his outer layer of organic material before he resembles a human being. The shedding is accompanied by all sorts of gooey scraps of rubber and the sounds of a bowl of molasses being stirred with a wooden paddle. Eww!, scream the enthralled ten-year olds, although even they by now must be a little sickened by the clichés.In the original, Rennie came to warn the earth to shape up or they'd be shipped out. Here, Reeves comes to destroy the earth because they're already screwing it up. This gives the producers of this grotesque piece of offal an excuse to show us magnificent scenes of destruction -- the big stadium in the New Jersey Meadowlands collapses and so forth -- before Reeves relents and realizes humans deserve another chance. There are, naturally, more subtle moments of fright. A couple of approaching lights in the night sky suddenly produce ear-splitting roars and destructive winds. They turn out to be helicopters -- straight out of a scene in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" Well, why not? Gort the robot is still along, but only for the ride. In the original, the outsized, metallic, tubular Gort possessed superhuman technical powers, while Klaatu was merely human in all respects. Here, Gort is no longer the size of a tall man. He's the colossus of Rhodes. And he's not tubular. He's built like a super hero in a comic book, bulging with human muscles. His latissimus dorsi would be the envy of Arnold Schwarzenegger at his most robust. The question of why a robot needs all his muscles in hominoid shape is never addressed.But in any case, Gort is irrelevant because Klaatu no longer needs him to do the heavy lifting. Klaatu has acquired all sorts of supernatural powers himself. I don't mean just technological powers but supernatural ones. He can bend men's minds to his will at a distance. He is clairvoyant, in that he knows that Jennifer Connolly is carrying a certain item. He even knows which pocket it's in. He can manipulate the current in an electrical circuit. He can bring the dead back to life. All of this leaves poor Gort dangling pleonastically in the breeze.The writing and direction are almost indescribably expectable. The camera can hardly hold still for a moment. (Neither does the earth get a chance to stand still, rendering the title pointless.) During an otherwise static scene it wobbles frantically as if eager to get back on the move before those ten-year olds begin to yawn. The shots are conveniently divided into two categories: (1) gigantic close ups of worried or horrified faces; (2) long shots of prodigious catastrophes.There are some improvements over the original. The kid is more believable here than there, where he was absent. And the exchange between Klaatu and the Professor makes at least as much sense here, although John Cleese, good as he is, is not Sam Jaffe.Instead of remaking successful movies like ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" why don't they remake failures and try to improve them? Klaatu?KLAATU? Where are you when we need you?",The Day the Earth Stood Still
12,Tweekums,Not a classic but an entertaining enough sci-fi reboot,7,20 July 2017,"This remake opens in 1928 in India's Karakorum Mountains where a mountaineer discovers a strange sphere; he collapses and when he awakens he appears to be well but a tissue sample has been taken from his hand. Cutting to the present day astrobiologist Dr Helen Benson is taken from her home to a government facility where she, and other scientists, are told that an object has been detected and it is expected to impact in Manhattan. When it arrives it lands rather than impacts. It is a sphere and a being exits. As Helen nears the being one of the soldiers surrounding the site fires and injures it. Moments later a giant robot emerges and neutralises the threat. The alien being orders it to stop. It is then taken to a facility where the bullet is removed; here it becomes apparent that what people are seeing is the being's biological space suit; as it comes off we see the being; it looks human. After a short while he looks like the mountaineer. The being says he intends to address the United Nations but the US authorities instead plan to drug him before interrogation; Helen helps him escape and shortly afterwards they are reunited. The being tells her that his name is Klaatu and he is here to save the Earth not humanity; he is here to save the planet from humanity. Helen is determined to persuade him that humanity can change; he isn't so sure about that and it might be too late anyway.It has been a few years since I saw the original version of this film so I can't compare them in detail perhaps a good thing. Judged on its own this is a decent enough sci-fi film. The story is interesting and I liked the idea of an alien saving the Earth from humanity. I know some people aren't impressed by Keanu Reeves' performance as Klaatu but I rather liked his somewhat otherworldly depiction of the alien being. Jennifer Connelly gives a solid performance as Helen Benson and Kathy Bates is good as the US Secretary of Defence; the closest the film has to an antagonist although her motives aren't malicious. Jaden Smith is OK as Helen's young stepson although his character is annoying most of the time and to my mind detrimental to the film. The special effects were impressive; I particularly liked the metal bugs that ate New York! Overall I wouldn't call this a must see film but it is entertaining enough if you are a fan of the genre.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
13,ma-cortes,A strange alien well personified by Keanu Reeves comes to Earth and is relentlessly pursued,6,27 March 2010,"This modern version to vintage science-fiction film deals about a strange sphere from outer space lands in the Central park, then appears a mighty robot .The lone occupant named Klaatu (Keanu Reeves similar role to Michael Wilding) steps out and is shot by a jumpy soldier.

Dignified Klaatu brings an important message to the planet about ecological warning but he is besieged. However, communication turns out to be difficult, and he is shot . The injured alien orders Robot to stop his rampage and is taken to a hospital from which he escapes in order to execute his mission , after that he contacts a scientific (Jennifer Connelly , similar role to Patricia Neal) and her son (Jaden Smith, Will Smith's son) , as Klaatu decides on an alternative approach. Meanwhile military (Rob Kneeper) and authorities (Kathy Bates , Kyle Chandler) have other objectives.This is a recent adaptation of the landmark sci-fi trenchantly written by Edmund H.

While in the classic movie that holds up well delivering an anti-nuclear warning, there a flying saucer orbits the 50,s Earth on Cold war era just after the end of WWII, landing in Washington DC, and the giant robot named Gort is a member of a race of super enforcers invented to keep the peace of the galaxy that will destroy the world, at this movie the Alien lands in Manhattan and the relation is developed between Klaatu, a scientist named Helen Benson and his son. The old version packed campy space gimmicks and not up to actual rendition that contains superior special effects plenty of computer generator images. Keau Reeves is good as a man from another planet who visits Earth and does not receive what could be called a warm welcome. Jennifer Connelly is credible as obstinate scientist who helps Klaatu facing several dangers. And sympathetic performance from Jaden Smith, nowadays successfully playing new version 'Karate Kid'.

14,paul_haakonsen,You shouldn't tamper with the classics...,5,16 December 2015,"As a rule of thumb, never do a remake, especially when you are fiddling with a classic. Yet, director Scott Derrickson felt the urge to do so and tamper with the 1951 classic.The reason why I decided to watch the 2008 remake was solely because of Jennifer Connelly starring in it. I am not hyped about Keanu Reeves, as his acting tends to be generic and the same movie after movie.Story-wise, then ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is entertaining enough, especially if you are not familiar with the 1951 classic. But I am just weighed Down by an overwhelming sensation that the movie was very unnecessary to have remade.The effects in the movie were good, obviously better than the original, needless to say. And luckily it is not all flash and bright colors, as many Sci-Fi movies of recent date tend to be.The movie had a good cast, which at least helped lift the movie experience up a bit, a list that includes Jennifer Connelly, Kathy Bates, John Cleese, John Hamm, Kyle Chandler and Keanu Reeves.""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is a mediocre movie and a remake that shouldn't particularly have seen the light of day, because it didn't revolutionize the movie industry or the Sci-Fi genre.

15,Coventry,Say your prayers and goodbye; the world will end tonight...,4,21 June 2012,"Remaking one of the ultimate greatest Sci-Fi milestones must be the most courageous and ambitious ideas ever or, one of the stupidest ever. The number of Sci-Fi/horror remakes unleashed upon us in the last 10-15 years is countless, but directors usually restrict themselves to remaking smaller and more modest cult gems so that, in many cases, a large share of the target audience doesn't even know it's a modern update of an older movie. Of course, if you plan to makeover one of the most recognizable and worshiped titles in the history of cinema, skeptical critics and film fanatics all over the world are ready to demolish your effort and call it blasphemy. But hey, my mother always taught me to be open-minded and never judge anything from beforehand, so there! Besides, there are a handful of elements to be carefully optimistic and assume that the new version of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" would nevertheless be worthwhile; most notably, the name of the director. Scott Derrickson debuted with ""Hellraiser: Inferno"", which is in fact the only watchable sequel in the entire franchise, and subsequently surprised everyone with the rather unique and absorbing court-horror movie ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"". Furthermore the film seemed to dispose of a wide enough budget for dazzling special effects (always nice in case of an apocalyptic saga) and a promising cast including Kathy Bates and John Cleese. Let me start by stating that I too am a huge fan of Robert Wise's 1951 original. This is undeniably one of the most influential and genre-defining films ever accomplished and I still vividly remember the overwhelming impact it had on me when I first saw it. So, regardless of how objective I tried to remain, I automatically compared even the smallest detail of this movie with the original, and then it simply is a failure from every possible viewpoint. In case there are still people unfamiliar with the plot: a collective of superior alien races, with technologies and wisdom far more advanced than ours, send their spokesperson Klaatu, along with his enormous 28ft pet robot Gort, to earth with an ultimatum: stop destroying the planet or face the disastrous consequences. The transfer of this message already goes horribly wrong, as the humanoid alien is immediately gunned down by nervous policemen as soon as he lands his giant space ball in the middle of Central Park. Humanity is even more petrified when Gort somehow deactivates all their artillery and vehicles. When Klaatu then still remains unable to pass his message to the right authority figures, he orders to launch project apocalypse. Mankind's last string of hope lies with single mother Helen Benson, who unconditionally attempts to save the stepson that disrespects her. Of all the defaults in this film, varying from small to more than medium sized, there are one or two things that bothered me enormously. The aliens' message ""stop destroying planet earth"" remained somewhat too vague and unmotivated. In the original (sorry for the comparison) the warning was clearly linked to the post WWII political turmoil and development of nuclear weapons. What exactly is the (biggest) problem this time? Terrorism linked to religious warfare? Global warming? Industrialization? A combination of everything? Be more specific, will you Klaatu! I expected tragic images of families torn apart by warfare or animals dying due to the changing of the climate, but nothing. Secondly, the monumental intergalactic robot Gort is really disappointing this time around. He may have increased 20ft in size in comparison to the original movie (sorry, again) but he also looks about 20 times less menacing. The dialogs are weak, there are far too many exaggeratedly fake melodramatic touches and the vast majority of the characters are downright bland. Scott Derrickson also never truly manages to generate an atmosphere suitable for the slowly approaching cataclysm. The special effects are indeed bombastic, fancy and plentiful  but sadly they're either irrelevant to the actual plot (like the landing of the space ship) or too grotesque. I did like the whole ""swarm"" concept near the end, though, for which I'm giving the film an extra point.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
16,michaelRokeefe,Remake of the 1951 classic.,7,13 December 2008,"The original Michael Rennie vehicle remains a Science Fiction classic. There is nothing wrong with a remake placing the action in a more contemporary time with modern concerns. The special effects are nice to look at, but nothing real outstanding. Which has me feeling a bit let down. Keanu Reeves plays Klaatu, the man of mystery with a huge robot companion...this time coming out of a huge twirling orb. And that is just one of the many that have landed through the world. A young knowledgeable woman of science Helen Benson(Jennifer Connelly)and her stepson Jacob(Jaden Smith)get caught up in Klaatu's 'friendly' mission of saving the earth from its own inhabitants and their destructive ways.

A remake of Robert Wise's 1951 film of the same name, it's based around Harry Bates' original short story titled Farewell to the Master. It stars Keanu Reeves, Jennifer Connelly, Kathy Bates, Jon Hamm, John Cleese, Jaden Smith and Kyle Chandler. Music is by Tyler Bates and cinematography by David Tattersall.Regardless of if you believe that Robert Wise's 1951 sci-fi classic to be a masterpiece of sci-fi cinema or not, fact remains it's certainly one of the best of its type; again maybe not saying much in the eyes of those who look down on 50's sci-fi. But either way, and I'm in the camp that adores and admires the original with some gusto, news of a remake was not greeted with keenness. Well over 50 years had past before someone dared to remake it, which in fairness and under closer topical examination, is rather viable given how the World has moved on. Good, then, that Derrickson and his team at least had the sense to re-image it for the current generation, gone is the Cold War thematic threat of nuclear war, where Klaatu tells us to sort ourselves out or else! In comes an environmental spin that not only carries with it quite some relevant concerns, but also comes with a kicker that this Klaatu really is only here to save the Earth, sod the humans! Of course now everything is bigger and louder. The film does actually honour the original in spirit, but with modern revamps comes the apparent need to dazzle the paying public with effects a go-go, so be the case here. Makers use the tools at hand to create some truly thrilling sequences, notably a Gort escape scene, but thankfully it's not a film solely reliant on effects to earn its coin. It would have been easy just to make such a movie, shallow and purely looking to make cash, but even though the script at times plods, narrative is strong and dovetails nicely with the dazzle. The problems arise with the lack of surprise factors, everything pretty much pans out as we expect it too, tense moments come but are followed by nothing startling or revealing, except for the ""big"" reveal from Klaatu, film plays it safe. Casting away from Reeves, who is well cast and plays it suitably subtle, is indifferent. Connelly is a fine actress, but script only calls for her to just react to her lead man and occasionally play emotionally perturbed in scenes with her angry/grieving/spoilt step-son (Jaden Smith passable if a little too annoying). Bates is miscast, but done no favours by the script writers, while Hamm is unconvincing (stories of him struggling with his dialogue are easy to believe) and Cleese is a cameo in all but name. So fair play to Reeves, who has had to suffer numerous jibes about him being alien like in performances elsewhere, because here the film hinges on his understated turn being devoid of histrionics, which is the case. He carries the film well and allows the others to get away with some barely adequate work. So, not the disaster remake many were anticipating, then. In fact the film made almost triple its money back Worldwide. It's far from perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it has enough about it to keep it above average and thus reward the more casual genre fan. 6/10",The Day the Earth Stood Still
18,Theo Robertson,Not A Great Remake But It's Not Dire Either,6,16 February 2014,"I take it everyone has seen the original ? Whatever its flaws it does deserve credit for making the audience understand why the film has that title . The alien Klaaatu demonstrates his power by temporally stopping all mechanical motion on Planet Earth for a brief moment in time hence The day the Earth stood still . , Not difficult to understand is it ? This somewhat clumsy remake goes about things its own way then just as the film is about to end someone somewhere just realises that "" Oh wait a minute we're making a film about the Earth stopping and yet we've failed to show scenes about the Earth stopping . Quick someone stick a scene in . What you mean it won't make sense ? You think anyone had noticed the lack of sense in the first ninety minutes ? "" That just sums up how careless things are . The script feels underdeveloped . Things happen because ... well they happen and there often feels that an entire backstory is missing somewhere . You also have to take on board that the Human Race are if not bad then certainly amoral and that we don't care about what we do to the planet and this might annoy alien species who are looking after the rest of the Universe . I mean if you don't get your own house in order imagine how the neighbours will feel if you're slamming your muddy footprints along the celestial street . Where as this type of premise would have been topical and ground breaking in 1951 today it seems clichéd and uninspired This remake is held in rather poor regard no doubt because it has been done to death so often it's in danger of committing cinematic necrophilia but I do think it's slightly better its reputation deserves . Oh don't get me wrong it's hardly a misunderstood masterpiece it does deserve credit on a couple of levels . One is the performance of Keanu Reeves an actor I usually go out to avoid but his wooden , unemotional , uninterested acting style that he normally brings to a movie is perfect for the character of Klaatu . The film also contains noticeable cinematography where everything seems shot in a greenish hue which gives a film a slight identity of its own . Small praise perhaps but there's been far worse sci-fi blockbusters released in the last few years",The Day the Earth Stood Still
19,poolandrews,"Not too bad, better than I expected.",5,22 December 2011,"The Day the Earth Stood Still starts as biologist Dr. Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) is escorted to a military facility & a top secret briefing for some of the world's top scientists, it is revealed that an object in space in on a direct collision course with Earth & will hit in just over an hour. The group prepare for the worst but once the object nears Earth it slows down, the object turns out to be a huge glowing sphere that lands in Central Park in Manhattan. The scientists are first on the scene & Helen approaches the sphere from which an alien creature emerges, a nearby soldier shoots the alien at which point a 60 foot tall robot appears & neutralises the military's weapons. The alien is taken to a nearby facility & given medical treatment but transform into what resembles an ordinary human man (Keanu Reeves), escaping from the facility when the military & politicians become hostile. The alien releases a swarm of mechanical insects that devour everything in their path in order to destroy humanity & it's up to Dr. Benson to convince the alien that the human race is worth saving...This American & Canadian co-production was directed by Scott Derrickson & is a remake of the original The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) & didn't turn out as bad as I had expected, it's no classic for sure but I liked it well enough. This modern remake is more of a re-imagining as a lot of things are updated for modern audiences & sensibilities while the basic plot & premise remain the same, back in the original the threat of nuclear war was the reason for Klaatu's visit while here it's environmental issues that force his hand, I did like the basic concept that people have all but destroyed the planet which is what we have really & there's no signs of us letting up so the central story is topical, relevant & does have some resonance & social worth. The environmental message is a good one but the film never really goes anywhere with it, there's no discussion of any possible solution & Klaatu seems to change his mind after witnessing Helen & her son get all emotional rather than talking to any world leaders or getting any assurances that humanity will change, there isn't even any sort of speech at the end & Klaatu simply leaves Earth. The script also has a heavy handed dig at trigger happy politicians & the military as it tries to say that merely destroying & killing things may not always be the best way forward. The character's are alright, the kid is a bit annoying & Klaatu doesn't get to do much but you get everyone's point of view, there's not too much scientific talk & it's easy enough to follow. The first half of the film works better as a sci-fi mystery rather than second half which is a little repetitive but there's plenty of effects scenes to keep things moving.I did like the idea that Klaatu was an alien inside a human body rather than an alien merely shaped like a human & his transformation into a human is nicely done. The CGI computer effects are pretty good, from cities being devoured by alien robot insects to the glowing sphere's to the explosions & other effects shots. I wouldn't say The Day the Earth Stood Still is exciting but it does have a few spectacular CGI effects scenes, it certainly had the budget & technology available to it that the 50's original could only have dreamed of. Everything is big & loud as you would expect from a Hollywood blockbuster but overall I quite liked this, I don't consider the original the classic many do & feel both versions have their merits.With a supposed budget of about $80,000,000 no expense was spared with top notch production values & some impressive CGI effects work, mainly filmed in British Columbia in Canada. The acting is alright, the kid ends up annoying while Jennifer Connelly is OK, Keanu Reeves plays it with little emotion & a blank face. Kathy Bates as the secretary of defence looks bored.The Day the Earth Stood Still isn't that far behind the original & does a good job of placing the story into a modern context that deals with modern issues but take away the CGI effects & a good first half there's not much here to leave you satisfied or to remember. A good solid effort that turned out better than I expected & worth watching if there's nothing else on & you need to pass a couple of hours. The Day the Earth Stopped (2008) was a low budget copycat rip-off that is absolutely abysmal.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
20,dbborroughs,Surpringly good,8,20 December 2008,"Remake/rethink of the classic scifi film from the early 1950's.The plot has Klaatu coming to earth to warn mankind to knock things off or else the aliens will take measures to knock it off for us. The original had Klaatu coming to earth in a space ship with a eight foot tall robot named Gort. Here he comes on a sphere with a 30 foot tall robot later called Gort. In both the effort to talk to world leaders goes awry however what follows is very different.I know this big screen version has had a good many pot shots fired at it, but I'm kind of at a loss to wonder why. To be certain its not a big action film and perhaps that has cooled some of the response. The film is also much darker than the original with Keanu Reeve's Klaatu deciding almost instantly to not play ball with us humans and take steps to wipe us from the planet so that the planet can survive. I know that Reeves performance is rather cold, but while I'm not a fan and find many of his performances equally frosty, I think it works here. I know other people are upset that they don't stay completely faithful to the original, but at the same time how could they be faithful to such a creaky (but good) film and not be roasted? I think most people were looking to hate its it because of what its not.I went in skeptical about liking it. The reviews were mixed at best so I didn't know what to think. Only the word of a good friend gave me hope that the film might actually be something special.Personally I liked this film a great deal.(I think it might go on my surprises list at years end). To me its an intelligent reinvention of the classic tale of the alien coming to warn us of the danger we're in. The early scenes of Jennifer Connelly being pulled from home for an unknown reason- the approach of Klaatu's ship are rather scary. Yes we know whats coming because we've seen the earlier film, but the people in the film haven't and its clear they are frightened and very human.I like the bleakness. I like how Klaatu is for the most part certain we can't and shouldn't be saved. Then again he's wonderfully full of contradiction as Connelly comments after he revives a cop he's killed before he's planning n destroying all of mankind.I love the new Gort who doesn't shamble but moves like the kid ass cop he is.(I also love the lack of explanation of him and for much of the alien technology-hey there isn't time to explain it so they don't). Gort is one bad dude and you shake your head as the military keeps trying to take him out with disastrous results.I love the small performances. John Cleese is wonderful in the very serious scientist that Klaatu meets to discuss the impending doom.He needs to do more serious roles. Equally great is James Hong has Wu another alien who has been living for years on earth, He was the one who raised the alarm of man's need to be destroyed, but who has mellowed and managed to come to love us and our contradictions.This is a very good solid (but not perfect) film. that is much better than its recent reviews and relatively low IMDb score would lead you to think it is. For me its so nice to have a remake that actually makes me feel like there was a reason to make it other than money.See this at some point.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
21,zardoz-13,An Inferior Remake of Robert Wise's Classic Cold War Parable,1,14 December 2008,"The landmark 1951 science fiction fable ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" concerned an extraterrestrial emissary named Klaatu (Michael Rennie of TV's ""The Third Man"") who came to Washington, D.C., in a flying saucer to warn Earthlings that they must not ""apply atomic energy to spaceships that will create a threat to the peace and security of other planets."" In the dreary, special effects laden remake, the intergalactic Klaatu (Keanu Reeves) shows up in a huge sphere in Manhattan's Central Park to warn Earthlings that they have treated the planet with the same lack of respect that they treat each other and have done so much damage that they must be obliterated. Hasn't Al Gore already said that without a spaceship and a monstrous robot?Environmentalists will no doubt applaud the remake for its global warming message, but popcorn-minded audiences aching for thrills and chills galore may find this high-minded but heavy-handed remake bland to the bone. Mind you, ""Exorcism of Emily Rose"" director Scott Derrickson and ""Last Castle"" scenarist David Scrapa have loaded ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" remake with more action than its relatively tame predecessor, but this sci-fi saga generates little drama or suspense in what amounts to an anemic disaster movie. The 8 foot robot that accompanied Klaatu now stands 28 feet tall and he boasts another weapon in addition to his laser beam eyeballs. Pretty Jennifer Connelly gives the best performance, while Keanu Reeves remains as inarticulate as ever as the alien. He was a hundred times better in last year's shoot'em up ""Street Kings."" Kathy Bates gives her best Hilary Clinton impersonation and dresses as tastefully as Sarah Palin. ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" springs no surprises with its ecological message.""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" contains a prologue that the original lacked. In 1928, a lone mountain climber (Keanu Reeves of ""The Matrix"") discovers a shimmering globe in the snow and touches it. When he awakens later from the shock that the object dealt him, he finds a hole has been burnt in his glove and a tiny patch of skin has been removed. The action fast forwards to the present as a military satellite detects an object streaking towards Earth with a crash point 78 minutes away in Manhattan. The government assembles an elite team of scientists to deal with the aftermath of this catastrophe since they cannot prevent it. Ignorant government agents come banging on the door of Princeton astrobiologist professor Dr. Helen Benson (Oscar winning Best Actress Jennifer Connelly of ""A Beautiful Mind"") and hustle her off to a helicopter and flight to New York City. When Helen isn't teaching, she is a single mom to her adorably obnoxious African-American stepson Jacob (Jaden Smith of ""The Pursuit of Happiness"") who hasn't gotten over the death of his father in combat. Jacob sasses his mom, wears his hair in tassels, and hinders more than helps her later in the action.Anyway, everybody reacts with shock when the alien spacecraft touches down without turning New York City in a colossal crater. Like his classic predecessor, Klaatu emerges and a trigger-happy U.S. Army soldier pumps a slug into him just as he approaches Helen in a Hazmat outfit, splattering red alien blood on her mask. About that time, a gargantuan robot named Gort emerges from the sphere and emits a laser beam blast that turns all weapons into dust. Klaatu halts Gort from continued destruction and lets the authorities rush him to a top-secret surgical suite and a doctor digs out the bullet. He informs them all that an embryonic human is swaddled beneath layers of placenta. This human matures rapidly into Keanu Reeves, though the filmmakers neglect to bring up the 1928 mountain climber.Since the president and vice president have been evacuated to an undisclosed location, Secretary of Defense Regina Jackson (Kathy Bates of ""Primary Colors"") greets Klaatu and refuses to turn him loose despite his having done nothing wrong. Instead, the scientists rush him off for a lie-detector test, but the resourceful Klaatu engineers an easy escape and hits the road with Helen. Jacob joins them and does everything he can to undermine Klaatu and Helen. Eventually, Helen takes Klaatu to meet Nobel Prize-winning Professor Barnhardt (John Cleese of ""Monty Python"" fame in a cameo) who received his accolades for biological altruism. The blackboard scene from the original is replicated, but Klaatu's dialogue with Barnhardt focuses on the welfare of planet Earth not the escalating arms race. According to Klaatu, there is a shortage of planets for sustaining life and humans have devastated the Earth too such a degree that they must be wiped out. Barnhardt pleads with Klaatu for the future of humanity; he argues that the brink of destruction will prompt humans to change their ways. Meanwhile, the military abduct Gort, imprison the robot in a silo, and try to cut through its impervious biological skin with a diamond drill. They fail miserably, but the 28 foot robot spawns the synthetic equivalent of locust and these bugs spread in clouds to destroy mankind and man-made structures.Okay, neither Robert Wise's ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" nor Derrickson's remake adhered to author Harry Bates's original pulp short story ""Farewell to the Master."" Of course, Wise's ""Earth Stood Still"" served as a cautionary anti-Cold War tale about the paranoia of nuclear proliferation as well as an allegorical Christ tale. After all, Klaatu called himself Mr. Carpenter and rose from the dead. Derrickson's spin has little in common aside from the bare bones basics of Edmund North's screenplay. While ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is new, this Keanu Reeves rehash is not an improved version of the timeless original.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Visual effects laden remake of the '50s sci-fi classic about a visitor from outer space named Klaatu (Reeves at his most - yet appropriately here  wooden) whose message of saving Earth is more than meets the eye. Connelly is the scientist attempting to aid the cosmic traveler in his quest but finds herself at odds with the government and military (natch).

23,neil-476,Needed to be more emotional than Keanu was,6,11 December 2008,"I have never seen the original from 1951 but, from what I've read and from the clips I've seen, I suspect that this remake follows it quite closely in terms of story and structure, albeit tweaked for present-day special effects and modern sensibilities.Keanu Reeves comes in for frequent criticism on the grounds of being somewhat wooden. This criticism isn't totally fair - in the right part he does well, and he unquestionably has a strong screen presence which for big screen popcorn movies, is often more important than acting chops. His screen persona serves him well here, his customary air of impassivity makes him believable as a non-human who is simply wearing a human body for the purposes of his assignment. The supporting cast is also good, particularly John Cleese in a very small cameo as a Nobel scientist, and young Jaden Smith as Jennifer Connelly's stepson.The special effects are mostly good, although the cloud of nano-insects sometimes fails to convince (the insects individually are fine, though), and giant robot G.O.R.T. (yes, folks, Gort has been acronymised) is impressive when he's not moving - when he moves, he looks like a cartoon.Given that the story is essentially identical to the original - alien representative Klaatu comes to the Earth to take humankind to task for its sins (warmongering in 1951, earth-raping in 2008), inflicts superior technology punishment on humankind (removing energy in 1951, deconstructing human artefacts - and humans! - in 2008), is prevailed upon to give humankind another chance after seeing the virtues of ordinary people - the main interest comes about by reference to context. In both movies Klaatu makes what is probably the mistake of trying to instigate dialogue with the USA which responds, in best blockbuster style, by trying to blow the cr*p out of everything alien, pursuant to the philosophy ""If you don't understand it, blow it away."" In 1951 this could be seen as a commentary on both World War 2 and the emergence of communism. In 2008 it is difficult to see it as anything other than a reflection of the Bush administration's adventures in the Middle East, and this adds a kind of appalled fascination at the sheer stupidity of continually throwing military force at an opponent who has already shown that such force is not effective.All this is to perhaps give the movie more stature than it merits. The original was unquestionably a classic of its time: the remake is not. It is workmanlike, proceeds efficiently enough, and often looks impressive, yet there is little emotional engagement, and the ending comes across as both abrupt and almost inconsequential. Perhaps part of the reason for this is Reeves being too effectively unemotional - maybe he needed to show the effect his realisation of the inner value of the Connelly, Smith and Cleese characters had on the humanity contained within his shell.I ended up quite enjoying the journey, but being dissatisfied when I reached the destination.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
24,anaconda-40658,The Day the Earth Stood for a Remake.,6,10 March 2016,"The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008): Dir: Scott Derrickson / Cast: Keanu Reeves, Jennifer Connelly, Jaden Smith, Kathy Bates, Jon Hamm: Worthwhile remake about examining oneself. A huge spacecraft lands in central park and one of the beings is abstracted and taken into custody. He looks human and informs us that mankind is ruining earth. It is surprising that it took him this long to figure that out. Screenplay lays heavier emotion than the original thanks to two supporting players. Director Scott Derrickson is backed with explosive special effects. Keanu Reeves delivers a lifeless performance as the being that bares all the personality of a store window dummy. Jennifer Connelly brings in the best performance as she is sought after to figure this event out. Jaden Smith plays her step-son who completes the emotional core of the film as he mourns his father's death and approaches Reeves to resurrect him but Reeves has other plans such as ruining the film's emotional credibility. Kathy Bates is laughable as a representative for the President who tries to form communication and is often shut off. Jon Hamm is given the standard role of NASA official who recruits Connelly.

Once Klaatu escapes with Helen and Will Smith Jr, it should have had a little humour.It most certainly doesn't, not even unintentional, and the rest of the film is just Connelly whining at Reeves, and Reeves with a look on his face that says 'whatever'.The effects are okay, some poor man, not even a character in the film, has one of the standout scenes in the film driving a truck, but the film really takes itself too seriously.Movies are supposed to stimulate the senses and provoke emotions.I felt depressed after seeing this, really depressed.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

27,Aaron1375,The day this audience member was bored.,3,22 December 2008,"Let me start off by simply stating that if you have seen the trailers for this movie you have basically seen all the special effects shots this film has to offer. There is really no surprises to be found within the movie other than a rather strange twist involving the robot. The only thing you get to see that is not really shown in the trailers is the fact there is an annoying kid throughout this movie that really takes this film down a notch. As for the plot, it reminds me of an alien fugitive movie more than an alien invasion movie. The centerpiece of the movie, the robot Gort, is just about a no show which is a pity seeing as how his first appearance is the highlight of this film. It looks good and intimidating, and it only has a couple of scenes to show what it can do. Most of the movie is an alien visitor wishing to speak with the world leaders, but all us Americans want to do is fight a force that is clearly capable of wiping us out rather easily. Alien befriends mother and awful stepson to some extent and ponders whether to destroy us all or not. Granted there is more to it than that, but for the most part it is a talky, preachy and rather dull science fiction movie. Keanu Reeves makes the movie somewhat tolerable, however, most of the cast is not that good and the less said about the stepson's performance the better...hell, if that is what all Earth children are like then go ahead destroy us all! A couple of special effects scenes are also impressive, but like I said nothing you have not seen if you have seen the trailers. I did like the swarm thing at the end though and thought that would have made a rather good movie by itself.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
28,Wuchakk,"Intriguing, Spiritual, Insightful, Moving",8,19 July 2011,"""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (2008) is an intriguing, powerful and even moving modern sci-fi blockbuster. I particularly like the symbolism: Klaatu=Christ, GORT=YaHWeH, as well as the numerous biblical references: Noah's Ark, the death plague, human beings trying to put God in a box literally, the sacrificial nature of agape love, etc. In other words, the film tackles subjects of great depth that every human being can relate to whatever their belief system. This itself separates it from the usual idiotic blockbuster fare.Now let me address some common criticisms (please see the film first before reading further due to SPOILERS):The kid is initially quite annoying but this is understandable as he's an archetype for what humankind is: an annoying, untrusting, simpleminded child-race. His sudden change into ""maturity"" represents how humanity needs to ""grow-up."" This helps make sense of the kid's repeated statements about killing Klaatu, which were magnified by the media's slander of Klaatu as a dangerous escaped convict. Klaatu's strange actions helped feed this negative mindset. As for the kid's dead father, the boy was only 9 years old and understood his father to be a soldier. Why wouldn't he have a mythical impression that he killed 'bad guys' for a living, likely with his bare hands?The judgment of mass human destruction was already set for the earth after hundreds of years of observation, including an Asian scout who lived with humans for 70 years. Klaatu was sent to activate the judgment UNLESS he observed some clear indication that the harsh judgment wasn't necessary yet. Klaatu didn't change the original plan UNTIL very late in the story, which is why he stated to Helen that he wasn't sure if he could overturn it. Although Klaatu was the primary agent, he wasn't necessarily alone. Gort was there and he was only partially robotic, as well as Mr. Wu. There were probably hundreds/thousands of other aliens involved in one way or another.The military attacks because their modus operandi is to defend the nation, which was augmented by the destructive nature of humanity in general.When Bate's character finally decides to send Helen out to talk with Klaatu she was the government's proverbial last hope. All other governmental attempts to prevent the judgment failed abysmally up to this point, not to mention the judgment of mass destruction was ALREADY well into motion. Other national leaders were concerned with saving their own.The biggest sphere was the central command orb. Klaatu didn't possess the power to stop the swarm himself; he had to get to the central orb to attempt to stop the mass destruction. Even then, he wasn't sure if he could do it. In fact, it cost him dearly.The alien swarm only destroyed humanity and all human imprints (like the stadium, the the installation and the semi); I saw no evidence of the swarms destroying trees or animal life. The animal ark-orbs were obviously precautionary in nature; in other words, the aliens knew there would be collateral damage due to the nature of the swarms so they snatched away all manner of animal life as a precaution.Klaatu made it quite clear what he was doing: saving the earth by destroying humanity and their intrinsic bent toward destruction. The way he put it was: If humanity lives the earth will die, but if humanity dies the earth will live.The Aliens are powerful, but it's inaccurate to call them careless. They monitored the planet for centuries and their decision was carefully decided.To write-off humanity's destructive bent as ""minor-league carelessness"" is shallow and un-enlightened, as well as wholly inaccurate.The aliens' actions had nothing to do with ""might makes right"" but everything to do with saving a planet from the infection that would wholly destroy it (people) if they failed to act. Their celestial judgment was that the cancer HAD to be cut out and time was of the essence.Really, the only ""detestable characters"" are the government as a whole, which is displayed as a cold machine. Helen (Jennifer Connelly) is a character of beauty, reverence and wisdom while the professor plays humanity's wise intercessor. Kathy Bates' character is unlikable because she represents the government and comes off as an arrogant machine-like biyatch. After she's completely humbled, however, she changes her tune. Meanwhile the kid is only 9 years old and lost both of his biological parents; cut him some slack. Besides, he also changes his tune and Klaatu takes on the role of his spiritual father. How can you NOT feel for Jacob when he falls on his face at his dad's grave?So none of the common gripes hold water. The insane bashing of the film is simply the result of an unjust critical feeding frenzy. If people would disregard the monkey-see-monkey-do panning and view the film with an open mind they might actually enjoy it and possibly discover something worthwhile.The film runs 1 hour, 43 minutes.GRADE: A-",The Day the Earth Stood Still
29,zetes,A disaster,3,14 December 2008,"I am not one who is against remakes in principle, not even remakes of really good films. The Day the Earth Stood Still is, as far as I see it, a prime candidate for remake. It would be easy to update this story to comment on current times. Modern audiences, after all, are very little effected by the Cold War anymore. The makers of this new version do, in fact, attempt to relate their film to modern affairs. The alien visitor, instead of interfering over Earth's nuclear ambitions, comes to out planet in order to stop us from destroying our environment. That's a perfectly acceptable updating. Unfortunately, as is the problem with most remakes, The Day the Earth Stood Still '08 has the unmistakable aura of having been made for a quick buck. You remember there's a classic called this? Throw us a few bucks, and you won't have to sit through it in black and white anymore! And there'll be a couple explosions! It all feels so rushed and sloppily thrown together. Scenes contradict each other, little of the plot makes any sense. The visual effects are wildly uneven. Gort in particular is a computer generated monstrosity that looks like he's been imported straight from a Nintendo 64 game. Pretty much all of the actors don't seem to want to be there, and almost all of them give abysmal performances. We expect that from Keanu Reeves, but when Jennifer Connelly, who gives it her all even in junk like Hulk, phones it in, you should realize your project has little merit. The entire film is poorly paced and frequently stilted. It never works.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
30,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Day The Earth Stood Still,2,11 December 2008,"Tis the season to be jolly, and because of the success of Will Smith's I Am Legend remake last year, I suspect tis the season for Hollywood to look at some of its past science fiction classics and set its gunsights on potential story lines to be redone, or ""reimagined"" on time for the holiday season, though the structure for this seemed to mirror quite closely to that of the original, save for the message to be preached.But as the saying goes, if it ain't broke, please don't fix it. While I still buy into the notion that us human beings will likely to wake up our ideas if we know for sure that we're not the only civilization in the universe out there, that bickering amongst ourselves would be just plain silly in the face of potentially hostile creatures from outer space, the way Scott Derrickson presented this film, seemed more like a rehash of plenty of sci-fi elements from the likes of Independence Day (alien ships hovering around the globe), Third Encounters of the Third Kind, Armageddon (seriously, I was half expecting Bruce Willis to board a space shuttle with his crew and enormous drillbit), and even that obvious shade of the Matrix with Keanu's shaven fetal state in goo. And could someone tell filmmakers that shots of empty streets of New York's Times Square is already passe?In this troubled time of ours, I thought the anti-war message is still quite relevant in today's context of world conflict, where hatred seem to be the emotion running very high. The original's message of peace doesn't ring any truer now, though this remake preferred to take on the more environmentally green message that if we don't take care of the Earth, the Earth will die and so will we, along with it naturally. But we Earthlings (or rather, the Americans) are a stubborn bunch, and toward all alien beings visiting our planet, they will dish out all available military hardware to obliterate anything that moves.Sure, like the original film, there will be some who will balk at the messiah like character of Klaatu, with his sudden appearance, of being born again in human form and performing miracles such as resurrections and healing. Some might also balk at Keanu Reeves' tendency to play such messiah like characters, though a different camp would argue that he excels in roles such as these given his lack of acting range. And true enough, there isn't much for him to emote except to be in awe and to adjust in his new homo-sapien form.The cast were all truly wasted, as Jennifer Connelly seemed to remake her Helen Benson from her Hulk's Betty Ross, while Jaden Smith didn't do much as the skeptical stepson Jacob Benson. Kathy Bates became a caricature as the Secretary of Defense, and John Cleese too was a flower vase as Professor Barnhardt. Yes, a male flower vase. If there's any level of difficulty here in anyone's acting, I'd give credit to Keanu Reeves for his dare to converse in Mandarin, which I thought was quite alright (probably even better than mine!)What was truly a letdown, was the pace at the final third of the film. The movie plods to the finishing line, and what do we get at the end of it? Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. The obvious parallels here to end the movie makes it look darn lazy, as you can substitute you know who for Galactus (a gaseous ball of mass) and for the Surfer himself. It's anti- climatic and very lacklustre, and I for one would have applauded if it went along the lines of the original to shove down its message verbatim to the audience, rather than to provide such a hokey ending that made it all a joke and threw whatever impact of its good-natured message out the window.And not since Jack Neo do I see product placement coming in so intrusively, like MacDonald's, and the one that took the cake, was that huge Microsoft Windows logo sitting pretty atop a glass table top for image manipulation. Those who would want to give this a go for its special effects, would like to know that all the extravagant money shots have already been included in the trailer, so you might want to save your money, and go rent the original instead, which is a classic in itself, rather than to sit through something that's very bland and generic. Disappointing stuff.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
31,siderite,"I liked it, but it's not great",7,8 March 2009,"The shadow of the 1951 film darkens all the reviews here. I haven't seen the original movie, but I did see the last scene of it, where the alien tells humans that ""they have a system and it works"" and that a race of robots was created to attack any and all aggressors, therefore there is no more aggression in the universe. That seems so silly now, especially in this political climate.As for the new one, Keanu does his job. I liked that his presence, in person and script, is so immense that humans feel like tiny insects. I have been longing for a movie like this, since it is obvious that no amount of human spirit would be a match for the technology (and experience) of a space faring species.The reasons why the alien comes and leaves are ridiculous, though. One can only update a concept so much before changing the entire thing. And one can only tell so much without spoiling the movie. Also, the different acts of the script seems too disconnected to be part of the same movie.Bottom line: the movie seems a bit slow in pace, but if you look back, you realize that there isn't much they could have left out. The little psychopathic black kid as a representative of the human race almost made me want GORT to destroy humanity. I wish the script would have been more consistent. All in all, average.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
32,namashi_1,A Letdown...,3,8 July 2010,"Back in 1951, a film with the same name was a immensely popular with people... 57 years later a lose remake is made. Expectations are massive, eye-catching promotion, Keanu Reeves in the central role etc. Sadly 'The Day The Earth Stood Still' doesn't live up-to its mark. When I rent a DVD... I not only bring it home with expectations, but even with a lot of excitement of how well will it entertain me.'The Day The Earth Stood Still' is a poor show all the way... nothing works in here. The film lacks the flavor. Filmmaker Scott Derrickson in henpecked by a poor script. The film starts on a dull graph and remains as such.In the acting department: Keanu Reeves delivers a sincere performance, playing the character with honesty. Jennifer Connelly is alright. Jaden Smith, as the irritating kid is perfect. John Cleese is wasted. Kathy Bates is as usual.on the whole 'The Day The Earth Stood Still' is more of a experiment than a entertainer.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
33,Smells_Like_Cheese,You know what's sad? 1951 had better special effects than we do!,3,22 March 2009,"So I was one of those people who was screaming no at The Day The Earth Stood Still remake, the original is one of my favorite movies. It's a terrific sci-fi film, probably the best to come out of the 50's era. I highly recommend it; moving onto the, sigh, remake. Keanu Reeves, mmmm, what on Earth about him scream alien? I guess since it looks like it hurts when his face expresses human emotion, he's what the director needed. But what I didn't appreciate about the remake is that it completely changed the story and the moral the first movie brought to us. If we were to have a remake of this story, at least it seems like in today's world it moral is more important than ever, that humans are just destroying themselves with all the technology and violence that we have created. Instead, I get 2 hours of Jennifer Connelly complaining to a stubborn Keanu Reeves on how much humans rock.Dr. Helen Benson, a Princeton professor, and other scientists are hastily assembled by the government in order to formulate a survival plan when it is feared that a large unknown object is due to impact Manhattan in approximately 78 minutes. Nothing can be done about it because a vital military satellite has been disabled. It hits Earth and out of the sphere comes a being named Klaatu emerges from the sphere while accompanied by a large robot. Klaatu, a representative of a group of alien races, has come to assess whether humanity can reverse the environmental damage it has inflicted on planet Earth. In the frightened confusion, Klaatu is shot, but survives and is taken to a government facility. While recovering from his injuries, Klaatu is detained by Regina Jackson, the United States Secretary of Defense, and is barred from speaking to the United Nations. Klaatu manages to escape, and he soon finds himself eluding the authorities throughout northern New Jersey, specifically Newark and the forested Highlands, with Helen and her stepson Jacob. After speaking with Professor Barnhardt about how his own species went through drastic evolution to survive its sun's demise, Klaatu is convinced by Helen and Jacob that humans can change their ways and are worth saving The three go toward the sphere in Central Park to stop the machine from destroying the world.So when I really think about this movie, it just makes me sad. I was going to be fair with the rating, but gosh, those special effects? For 2008, it seems like we got worse with CGI, the ending effects were just way way way over the top. Keanu Reeves is sadly the only convincing actor in the film...? Oh, my God, did I just say that? Not to mention, did Kathy Bates owe someone a favor? She's a terrific actress, why was she in here? I also love how Jaden Smith, Will Smith's son, is taking his daddy's footsteps in alien movies, does Will Smith come from another planet? Because it seems like that family is obsessed with aliens. I'm going to do you a favor and recommend watching the original Day the Earth Stood Still, believe me, it's so much better.3/10",The Day the Earth Stood Still
34,disdressed12,WTF was that?,3,26 May 2009,"to say this movie was disappointing is a huge understatement.it's allegedly a science fiction film,but it i really isn't.it's a actually a drama with a lot of talking and not much else.people talk a lot and nothing much happens.there is a fair bit of suspense ,but it builds and builds and...nothing.there's nothing wrong with a good drama,if that's what you're expecting.even so,this isn't really a good drama,but any stretch.it is however,tedious to the nth degree.it's also one big cliché after another.apparently one of the editions of the DVD has an alternate ending.i haven't seen that.but i have a great idea for an alternate beginning:the invaders appear right away,and wipe every human being who would otherwise have to sit through this thing,off the map.at least those who hated it.what a dog 3/10",The Day the Earth Stood Still
35,KineticSeoul,Entertaining to a degree but nothing special,5,27 April 2013,Now this movie asks some decent questions but just didn't have that humanity aspect of it shown all that well. It does have the elements of human nature and their direction towards their own destruction and the earth itself. But isn't as impactful as the 1950's version. And the message seems to be a bit more forceful this time around. I found this movie to be more entertaining than the 1950's version but the writing and the development of the characters just isn't as good. And seem to rely too much on the special effects and cool quotes instead of making a well developed story. This movie is about an hour and a half long so it has plenty more time for better development. I thought Keanu Reeves is a great choice for the role as the alien named Klaatu. Keanu is a cool actor but he is just really good with these stiff and emotionless roles while still having that charisma. The thing is the transition of Klaatu is more underdeveloped than the 1950's version. Even if Klaatu and his alien robot GORT is way more intimidating this time. This movie should be going in a serious direction but when it comes to certain parts of this movie like the U.S. military and the actors and actresses. It looks like something that came straight out of a Michael Bay movie. Also one of the theme or message about how people or the human race can change when under the brink of destruction might be true to a degree. But the question of how long and which individuals? Comes up. Jennifer Connelly is alright in this but she is usually good in these scientist or analyst roles. This is a entertaining movie to a degree but it ends pretty abruptly without much necessary development in certain areas. It's watchable but nothing that really makes this movie stand out in this types of sci-fi genre.5.5/10,The Day the Earth Stood Still
36,OllieSuave-007,Humans vs. Aliens.,8,26 December 2008,"This is a pretty good movie about the Earth being invaded by aliens, who wanted to save Mother Earth by wiping out the human race. Klaatu, played by Keanu Reeves, is the alien messenger in human form and came to warn the people of the aliens' sinister plan. Helen Benson, played by Jennifer Connelly, tries to persuade Klaatu that people can change for the better.The story plot is solid and the movie gets to the point right away, with no dragging and lagging subplots. I thought that this movie would get a little political but it fortunately dissuades from that method and basically sends a ""save the earth"" and ""stop the violence"" message. Mr. Wu, played by James Hong, tells Klaatu that there is another side to humans: love and hope. So, it is through this subtext that people could change for the better.A very enjoyable and exciting film, overall.Grade B",The Day the Earth Stood Still
37,sddavis63,An Unspectacular Remake,6,26 February 2011,"Any remake of one of the classic sci-fi movies from the 1950's has to be compared to John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" made in 1982. Of all the remakes, that was probably the best - as good as and possibly even better than the original, with a story that was clearly based on the original, but different enough to leave the viewer with a real feeling of uncertainty about what was happening. Unfortunately, 2008's ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" doesn't match up to Carpenter's work on ""The Thing"" and isn't as good as the 1951 movie it's remade from, even though I think the original version is itself a little bit over-rated.The failure starts from the beginning. There's an attempt to build suspense by having an object discovered that's fast approaching Earth, and that looks as if it's going to obliterate us when it does. But if you've seen the original, you know what's happening and those opening scenes seem largely wasted because there is no suspense to them. You just wait for the movie to actually start. (I suppose the opening plays a role if you've not seen the original.) The story itself modifies the original story to an extent, but still seems too much like the original. Keanu Reeves plays Klaatu in this - Klaatu being the alien who arrives to tell humanity that we're doomed, because an inter-planetary community has decided that we're too dangerous to be allowed to exist. A nod to the modern world seems to have this warning based not so much on the threat we pose because of our nuclear technology (which really doesn't seem to me to represent any real threat to intelligent aliens, who must be so far advanced that nuclear power is a joke) but rather suggests that the aliens are nature lovers of a sort who are upset at the devastation we've wrought on the environment - so that the threat we pose is not to other alien species or even to ourselves but rather to the earth (a point Klaatu makes repeatedly.) So the movie clears up what I thought was a bit of a silly plot point from 1951 by making this a politically correct, environmentally conscious movie.The role of Klaatu wasn't especially a part that stretched Reeves. He simply had to adopt a largely unemotional demeanour for most of the movie. Jennifer Connelly plays Helen Benson in this version. Benson is a more impressive character here than in 1951. She's an astro-biologist (someone specializing in the potential for outer space life) and she's central to the effort to understand Klaatu. Somehow, though, Connelly didn't work in the role for me. I understand every movie's need to have a young and attractive woman in a leading role, but this Helen Benson needed more maturity for me to take her seriously. Kathy Bates' role was a bit strange I thought. She played the U.S. Secretary of Defense - understandably an important position when you're worried about an invasion from outer space, but while she talked to the President on the phone every now and then I found myself wondering - where IS the president? Shouldn't the president be front and centre? Why not just have Kathy Bates play the President instead of the Secretary of Defense? I never could get my head around that.The robot isn't especially central in this, and Klaatu doesn't need to study humanity, because humanity's already been studied. Unlike the '51 movie, humanity's destruction isn't only threatened here, the plan is put into effect. Obviously, the effects are pretty good, and while they're quite in evidence, I didn't think the movie made excessive use of them, mostly staying true to the original story in focusing on the people and how they respond to their plight, although the relationship between Benson and her stepson really didn't manage to strike much of a chord with me. It was however the focal point of the climax, as Klaatu realizes that there's a positive side to humanity. Some criticize this for having an incoherent storyline. I don't share that criticism. The storyline seemed to me to be coherent enough - even pretty straightforward. It just didn't seem to push the envelope enough. It's not especially suspenseful, dramatic or thrilling.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
38,Buddy-51,Pointless remake of a sci-fi masterpiece,5,7 January 2009,"About the best thing that can be said for the remake of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is that it probably won't diminish anyone's cherished memories of the 1951 original - which, if it isn't the greatest science fiction movie ever made, is certainly one of the most thoughtful and intelligent the genre has ever produced.As in the original, which boasted incisive screen writing by Edmund H. North and stylish direction by Robert Wise, an alien named Klaatu (accompanied by his fellow traveler, the destructive robot bodyguard known familiarly as Gort) arrives unexpectedly on Earth to warn its inhabitants that they face imminent destruction from an intergalactic confederation if they don't straighten up and become better stewards of their corner of the cosmos. In the original, which was made at the height of the Cold War, it was the human propensity for nuclear self-destruction and the possibility that it might extend into the far reaches of outer space that was the understandable concern of our celestial neighbors; in the updated version, it's the threat we pose to the environment that, for less clearly defined and plausible reasons, has their panties all in a bunch (are they afraid that property values in the immediate galactic vicinity will drop if the planet is allowed to go under?).Whereas the original stood at the forefront of what was then a brand-new genre, this new version, adapted by David Scarpa and directed by Scott Derrickson, arriving as it does after decades of space invader movies such as ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind, "" ""Independence Day,"" ""War of the Worlds"" and Contact,"" can't help but come off as hopelessly old-school and old-hat at this moment in movie history. The imagery and set-pieces are way too familiar and shopworn at this point, and no amount of pretentious blathering about environmentalism or the redemption of the human race can make them seem fresh again. Moreover, the actual day-the-earth-stood-still scene, which was such a pivotal cornerstone of the first movie, has been so radically altered as to be rendered utterly insignificant in this edition. Also, by making environmental destruction the central theme of the film rather than the inability of peoples and nations to forego their differences and to work together for a common good, much of the tension that drove the original story is unfortunately lost.As the original Klaatu, the stage-trained Michael Rennie delivered a performance of such understated power and serene authority that he practically lifted the movie to the level of Shakespearean tragedy. No matter how otherworldly he may have appeared at times, he was always able to relate to the audience by connecting on a human level with the other actors in the scene (he wasn't afraid to smile and display a sense of humor every once in awhile as well). Keanu Reeves, on the other hand, plays it dead straight all the way, settling for a singsong monotone that may indeed be appropriate to an extraterrestrial but which allows him to slip into self-parody more often than is comfortable for a movie that is trying to deliver such a sobering message. The Patricia Neal role of the boarding house widow who befriends Klaatu and helps him hide from the authorities, has been upgraded here into a young astro-biologist (played by the gifted Jennifer Connelly in a surprisingly grating performance) who's spent her life studying the principles of extraterrestrial life and is, thus, the natural go-to gal for this stranger in a strange land.Perhaps inevitably - though certainly regrettably - the brilliantly innovative and masterful score by Bernard Herrmann is nowhere to be found on the soundtrack. And even the special effects in this version don't seem as envelope-pushing and state-of-the-art in our own day as the original's did in theirs.So - as we find ourselves asking again and again at this sort of thing - why the need for this remake? Your guess is as good as ours.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
39,thesar-2,The Day the Earth Stood Still Again,1,13 December 2008,"(Contains spoilers in closing) I recently reviewed the original ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and boy, with any of its flaws, I would thoroughly recommend (and watch) any day over this ""re-imagining"" in 2008. Beyond its promising opening act leading into the interrogation scene, the rest is just flat out crap. If I were Klaatu, and this was my first/only trip to (whoever's) Earth, and these were the people I met along the way, I surely would've destroyed all mankind as well. Starting with Will Smith's son, or at least the character he portrays (I would've anyways for that hideous hairdo). All the fear, hatred, rebellion is knocked right out of him in a split second scene on a bridge, where suddenly he's friends with the alien that just killed several humans  the reason in the first place the boy is afraid and wants the alien dead. As for Keanu Reeves, simply the worst actor in history, he really wasn't the problem. In fact, aside from ""Bill & Ted,"" this seemed to be a perfect role for him. (Although, I previously wrote he should've played GORT  as that's as far as his acting range lies.) Once again we're served with the sermon on going green, such as the similarly titled ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" the latest Bond movie ""Quantum of Solace"" or the retched ""The Happening."" And once again, we're (supposedly) taught that humans are worth saving and we can *change*. Earlier in 2008, in ""Diary of the Dead,"" the final line read something like: ""But are we really worth saving?"" After viewing any of the morons in this film, you must simply state no, agree with Klaatu('s original mission) and help lead the destruction of the Earthlings. (Spoiler Alert  The final scene, where Earth finally does stand still, or at least the technology, seems like an afterthought and just thrown in because they used the same title. And if you were trying to remember the feeling you got in the original where Helen was to shout the command: ""Gort! Klaatu barada nikto!"" you might as well just re-watch the original  it's gone from this film.)",The Day the Earth Stood Still

41,Robert_duder,A perhaps surprisingly decent remake/sci-fi film,8,26 January 2009,"Alright it's true I seem to have this odd love for these supposedly poor film remakes like The Fog, or Amityville Horror but I have never seen the original film that this remake is based on. This big budget spectacle looked particularly good and when I finally saw it I was not disappointed. The film does deliver a solid science fiction experience with plenty of stunning special effects but some unfortunately mild performances but usually mild actors. The plot of the film doesn't particularly hold together completely perfectly and yet still you will find yourself enthralled and enjoying the movie despite these flaws. They aren't glaring flaws, just simply enough to make the film not do what they hoped it would at the box office. It would appear that a lot of IMDb reviewers have the same complaints...they bad mouth direction and performances but also seem to insist that the film doesn't fit together properly and that it doesn't all add up the way it should. Many of these reviewers seem to be fans or have seen the original, something I have not. I do agree but on a different level because I didn't find these details severe enough to hinder my enjoyment of the film.Keanu Reeves certainly has his moments. He worked well for The Matrix films, his brooding tones work for strange romances and films like Constantine and other action films. Still I think Reeves has very, very little range as an actor and I think The Day The Earth Stood Still proves that in leaps and bounds. Reeves is dry, and monotone which is part the character and part the only way he can play the role. I don't know who could have done better but I didn't feel he was the best for the part of the alien entity visiting Earth. Jennifer Connelly is brilliant scientist Dr. Helen Benson who is brought in on this world disaster at the last minute. I admit that I find Connelly a little dry and humorless and I've never been blown away by her performances. Unfortunately this doesn't change anything. I mean she does alright and her and Reeves actually have chemistry somehow (two wrongs make a right?) Still she is kind of dull on the big scale. Jaden Smith is probably one of the better actors in the film, it does run in his blood and although he doesn't have a huge role he does very well for a young actor. The supporting cast is impressive enough but they don't utilize the talent enough. John Cleese is terrific in a small role, and Kathy Bates is decent as the Secretary of Defense.Cast unfortunately not withstanding the story and the special effects are the parts that really do make the film worthwhile. The movie is actually a solid sci-fi movie that is very watchable. Director Scott Derrickson is a new young director but he already blew me away with the impressive Exorcism of Emily Rose so he does have talent at telling a story. I couldn't care less what comparison or lack of comparison there is to the original film. I don't watch a remake to see the original one rehashed but rather what new actors, new film makers can do with an old story and I certainly enjoyed what they did. The film IS worth seeing and you'll enjoy a sci-fi spectacle with some really terrific effects. 8/10",The Day the Earth Stood Still
42,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"A decent enough remake, that maybe tries to take itself a bit more seriously than it should",7,16 December 2008,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Scientist Dr Benson (Jennifer Connolly) and a group of other experts are taken by mysterious government agents in the middle of the night for reasons they can't work out. They learn a giant asteroid is headed towards earth and they have only seventy eight minutes to avert it. As it falls to earth, the military are called in to take out the threat, come what may. They encounter a giant robotic creature, as well as a giant alien shell that contains Klaatu (Keanu Reeves.) Re-awakening and adjusting to his surroundings, Klaatu is held at a research facility against his will, until he uses some mysterious powers to break out. On the run, he eventually hooks up with Dr Benson who upon learning his true intentions here on earth, is forced to test her will to the ultimate level.The original The Day the Earth Stood Still film still retains some of it's cult greatness, even though it's easy to laugh at it's now rubbery special effects and campy fifties dialogue (no doubt ground breaking at the time!) But it carried a serious tone, set against the cold war angst of the time and warnings of what could happen if man failed to learn to live in peace with each other. By applying that philosophy to modern times, Scott Derrickson's new film may have alienated some of his audience by giving it such a serious, reflective tone instead of just the undemanding 'blockbuster' type film everyone was expecting (says it all that it wasn't released in the summer.) Any film where John Cleese makes a non-comedic cameo (even playing a character called Basil!) is probably in need of a bit of loosening up.Performances wise, in the lead role Reeves, by his own admission in a magazine interview, tried to make his character 'more flat and expressionless.' No stretch there then. In support, rising star Connolly plays her role quite well, as does veteran co star Kathy Bates as the ball busting head of the facility who can't accept her opinion might not be right. The special effects, including Gort (whose name here is cleverly taken from a military abbreviation to mean Genetically Organic Robotic Technology!) turning into a flying pile of soot that destroys everything in it's path, are quite good but the story fails to really generate a decent narrative flow and so doesn't really hold your attention and the ending seems to just come and go and failing to wrap things up properly.It's not an awful re-make, thoughtful, reflective and with some decent effects, but it probably doesn't hold your attention quite as well as it should. ***",The Day the Earth Stood Still
43,dromasca,a failed encounter,3,11 July 2010,"Almost nothing works in this remake of a classical science-fiction movie in the 50s that brings to screen an encounter between civilizations which is failed on many respects. We may have seen too many films in the genre since then, or we may have gotten enough with ecological self-criticism in order to get too impressed with the idea of aliens coming neither to conquer the planet nor to abduct humans, but rather to save Earth FROM humans.It is not that the authors of the script and director Scott Derrickson gave too many chances for the idea to develop. There are too many coincidences and too many unexplained details for the story to have any trace of credibility. Why should the alien spaceship in Central Park of all places? How is the introductory episode related to the rest of the film (excepting the big glowing sphere, of course)? etc., etc., etc., A lot of wasted talent is spilled on screen. Keanu Reeves and Jennifer Connelly are fine actors, here they are obliged to give wooden performances and they are even prevented to build any chemistry between them which would have maybe given more interest to the story. Kathy Bates enjoys in this film the worst casting of her whole career. Special effects are less than average with one exception which is indeed worth being included in an anthology, but you cannot save a film with one special effect.

And this robot just stays in one spot and finally the army some how designs a box to capture it in and study it. Just silly.The spheres were bad special effects too. And what do you say about Keanu Reeves acting. If his monotone voice it supposed to be alien like, well, I guess you could say he did OK. Otherwise, he really needs to stick to surfer/cop movies.And the finally resolution of Jennifer Conley trying to convince the alien that humans can change was really bad.

48,inkblot11,"No lies here, this film is rather unexciting, despite the very fine cast and effects",6,14 February 2011,"Quite a few years ago, an Eskimo, Klaatu (Keanu Reeves) heard something outside the igloo and went to investigate. He wound up being captured by very intelligent aliens and disappeared from the earth. Now he has returned to the astonishment of the U.S. government. The Secretary of Defense, Regina Jackson (Kathy Bates) summons a group of the country's best scientists to Washington, including molecular biologist, Helen (Jennifer Connelly), who takes along her stepson (Jaden Smith). It is soon apparent that something is going to happen, perhaps an alien invasion. In fact, Helen gets closer to Klaatu than anyone else and is stricken to learn that humankind is about to be destroyed. Klaatu tells her that he has lived with the superior beings for years and agrees with their conclusion that the human race is vile, through and through. Can she persuade him otherwise? What about her young son, since he is a reminder of everything good in the world? Now, first off, I have not seen the classic version, so I may amend this review when I have done so. But, this one is a merely fair-to-middlin sci-fi thriller. The story just seems disjointed and haphazard, at times, and doesn't unfold powerfully. However, the cast toils very hard to make it work, with Connelly and Smith, especially, adding much to the film's enjoyment. Reeves is a perfect choice for the alien, as his role is to be played as unemotional, for the most part. Its Bates who's really fun here, if only SHE WAS the Defense chairmen, would she ever scare the willies out of the leaders of North Korea, Iran, and anyone else in her path! Also, the special effects are superlative, resulting in amazing visuals. So, if you are a science fiction fan, or a fan of the cast members, you might want to consider giving the movie a try. But, in my view, know ahead of time that the film will not be totally satisfying.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
49,tabuno,Some Nice Moments But Lacking,7,20 January 2019,"20 December 2008. This remake of the 1951 classic contains some nice elements, adds a poignant emotional element, yet it leaves out a few helpful supportive devices. The rather unique mother-son relationship in this movie is typical, but effective and rarely used. Kathy Bates gets to portray a rather together and the mostly effective political leader in the movie. Missing however are the personal background shots that would have made the movie more tight (example - the initial confrontation with Keanu Reeves failed to have any reflective shot that motivated the incident that occurred during the scene and there were no background about further military strategies involving the mysterious object that came to earth, they just happened). The beginning sequences had a ""Encounter of the Third Kind"" feel which in some ways was both exciting but also irritating, because some of the dialogue didn't seem to ring true. Kyle Chandler's use in the movie felt miscast. Gort was underused in this version and didn't get quite the key pivotal role that would have made the movie even more on your sit exciting. Keanu Reeves did a competent job and his dialogue was some of the more appealing and captivating. The special effects were both good and sloppy (for the current movie technology). This was a decent, entertaining movie with an emotional bite but failed to equal or exceed the original in scope and intensity.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
50,Rodrigo_Amaro,It should never be made,4,20 March 2011,"When I heard that Hollywood was planning a remake for Robert Wise's reverenced classic ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" I said to myself that I would never watch the remake, ever. The movie was released a few years ago and I was still with the same opinion, but I heard the critics buzz and some of the moviegoers opinions and they predicted a bad movie ahead. But I have the tendency of seeing the disaster with my own eyes and form a opinion about it, because there are times we might be wrong creating false expectations. In this case, it wasn't false remarks that I was hearing about.The new version of 1951's classic, instead of a movie to bring peace and with a powerful message, shows a dark twisted sci-fi film where Klaatu (Keanu Reeves) is here on our planet to destroy us simply because our planet is too valuable for us, people, to destroy it. A scientist (Jennifer Connelly) will try to do everything in her hands to convince this half men - half creature thing that we can change our destructive habits. And just like the other film, Klaatu might change his plans after meeting a kid (played by an annoying Jaden Smith, another kid that Hollywood makes us swallow deep), and a professor (John Cleese in his most dramatic role since ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"").Why this movie didn't worked? First, how come you remake a beautiful cult classic and expect to make a hit out of it? People have a tremendous respect over that film and this couldn't succeed at anything except in have better special effects, but the human aspect, the heart of the classic film wasn't present here. It has a great beginning, a sort of mysterious thing in the plot but after Connelly got arrested the movie went downhill faster than a car with engine problems in a slippery road. For the most part, it's boring, tiresome, Reeves acting is in the automatic pilot and by the time the visual effects appear to lift up the audience you'll be already sleeping, like I did in a few brief moments. It's good to see Connelly in a nice performance, she never disappoints, Kathy Bates playing a authority figure was very interesting, James Hong's special appearance was great but the best performance in the whole thing comes from John Cleese. He disappointed a few people with a dramatic role because people were expecting some humor coming from him and there was none, but I enjoyed his brief and important scene. His voice sound very different than the usual comical sound that he's well known in using, and just seeing doing something different was very nice. There are good actors with some good scenes and that's the greatest reward you're gonna get from here.Earth wasn't still but I certainly was, almost sleeping while watching this dull film. 4/10",The Day the Earth Stood Still
51,johnnyboyz,This is not the disaster I expected it to be but don't let that sound like a lot of praise.,6,24 December 2008,"I think if you go along with it, this remake of a greatly admired American classical era film can be enjoyed to a certain extent. That's not to say the film is brilliant and thoroughly effective, because it isn't and whatever point or subject matter it's taking on here, it delivers in a simple and straightforward manner that is easy for its target audience to understand. In fact, its message is put across in such a manner that at times the film resorts to having Keanu Reeves quite literally deliver a speech to another character in a routine and bland manner about how the humans are destroying the Earth. This is inter-cut with the character sobbing back: 'We can change! We can change!' The argument is established and the immediate psychological reaction of the watching (target?) audience amongst all the mayhem and peril is returned.So onto the argument and, quite clearly, it's to do with the destroying of the planet within. It's as simple-a read as a straight, flat two foot putt, hammered home thanks to scenes such as the above and one of those annoyingly 'noticeable' montages right near the end of lots of machinery, cars and trains just stopping dead: 'remember to cut back on carbon omissions, everyone  if you're going to see the film at the cinema then walk to the cinema, for God's sake walk. Similarly, if you're going to watch the film on DVD then set up an elaborate mechanical contraption that means you have to cycle to power your DVD player and television resulting in lots of pedalling as you view the film.I'm joking, of course, but that's how rather silly the whole message comes across in this retelling. But if you want to walk to the cinema to see it or whatever then by all means do. Like I said, Keanu Reeves adopts the mantle left by Michael Rennie and plays Klaatu, an alien visitor from outer-space although we first see him on a snowy Indian mountain in 1928 as an odd sphere beams down and takes a DNA sample of the him thus allowing them to return eighty years later with one of them disguised as a member of the human race. Once here, Klatuu and his giant CGI robot Gort emerge from their spaceship and all Hell eventually breaks loose.The film seems a little conflicted as to whom its overall protagonist actually is. I think it wants Jennifer Connelly's Dr. Helen Benson to be the lead role, purely through the fact she's a human being and it is her, like the rest of us, we are being lectured to about the harm we are causing the planet - we are in her shoes. Harking back to the 'lecture' shots from earlier, Benson is slightly off camera but had she been any straighter on, Reeves would've been talking directly at us. Then again Klaatu goes on more of a journey and adopts a meek self discovery position to which he sees the smarter and more educated side of the human race (in John Cleese of all people) as well as the more emotional side of our species when an ever so slightly heart wrenching scene in a graveyard plays out.But the problem is you'd probably get a bigger kick out of this if Keanu Reeves was a better actor than what he is. I usually shy away from either criticising or praising acting but here something must be said. He's already set himself up for criticism by stating something to do with being someone 'with' an alien body and 'in' an alien body but here, the same reaction to every event is greeted with a deadpan and expressionless face, even the epiphany in the graveyard I mentioned. In fact it's so ordinary, Will Smith's ten year old son Jaden Smith playing Helen's stepson Jacob, out-shines him.The build up and set up to the sphere coming down to Earth; the rounding up of America's leading brains and the general panic-come-ambiguity as told from the official's point of view is stuff we've all seen before in Independence Day and Mars Attacks! so that's all fine and it culminates in a scene of initial contact between Benson and Klaatu amid the panic that peaks right there. But there is something distinctly bizarre about seeing a stone faced, wide eyed Keanu Reeves sitting in a McDonalds opposite an elderly Chinese man whilst speaking in Mandarin. The man is another one of Klaatu's kind; I'm sure he's helped contribute to the ruining of Earth through pollution in his time here; but no, blame us.Klaatu's antagonism is initially presented through meeting American battleaxe government official Regina Jackson (Bates) and her suited cronies and it's only until he meets a calmer, more intelligent, British, more grounded character in Professor Barnhardt (Cleese) that he starts to form his own opinions. Of course we know the professor's smart because he's both played by a British actor and he listens to The Goldberg Variations by Bach. I don't think you come away from the film thinking about the human race and the greater good as much as the film would like you to and part of the reason is the sense you're frequently being lectured to. Nevertheless, it's mysterious at times and there are evenly spaced thrills to be had out of it despite some additionally nasty product placement. Some have complained about the exclusion of ""Klaatu Barada Nichto"", but isn't that what Gort mumbles in a low, electronic voice following Klaatu being shot near the beginning? I guess they'd rather someone actually stood up and said it in context for all to hear than in the fashion they actually do.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
52,filipemanuelneto,Not worth wasting time trying to see this movie.,1,19 December 2019,"This movie is a remake of another 1951 film, where the human race first contacts an alien entity, which lands on the lawn of New York's Central Park. Immediately surrounded by the entire state security apparatus, only one scientist, Dr. Helen Benson, can actually dialogue with the visitor and realize their true intentions.Well, I didn't see the original movie, so I can't compare them. However, I don't need to do this to conclude that this movie had no reason to be if the idea was to make such a bland movie. Totally forgettable, it has no emotion or any kind of feeling. It is an absolutely empty, almost robotic movie. The script is very poor and the pace of the film is so uneven it becomes unpleasant. It all starts very suddenly, and the first ten minutes of the movie are mind-blowing and make the viewer think ""Wow! Let's take it easy!"" But from the moment the ship lands, everything slows down, with the movie dragging at certain times. Scott Derrickson ensured the accomplishment, but he did it so coldly, so bland and lifeless that I felt like breathing for a bottle of oxygen. Maybe he should refrain from directing sci-fi movies.The cast is full of capable names, but the material given them has turned them into freshmen who have just emerged from drama schools. Jennifer Connelly has done such a good job on ""Requiem for a Dream"" that it's hard to recognize her here. She seemed totally oblivious to what she was doing, uninspired. The same can be said of John Cleese, in a brief appearance but which gave us, I think, the best interpretation this film has to give to its audience. Honestly, I never really liked Keanu Reeves, I always thought that he has a face that looks like a wooden board, since he never moves a muscle regardless of the character's emotions. So I think you were decent in the role of an alien ... maybe the actor is a real one. Finally, Jaden Smith brilliantly manages to supplant Dakota Fanning in ""War of the Worlds"" (2005) and become the most utterly unbearable idiot brat I've ever seen in a movie.Forget the special and visual effects the movie has, forget the technical details and the cinematography, and all those things I usually talk about a movie. None of this is any good here, because the movie is bad anyway. In fact, it's not worth the time to see it.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
53,leplatypus,The day Hollywood stops rewriting remakes (DVD),4,11 November 2010,"When this day comes, it would be great. Up then, we will find craps like this movie. For me, a remake (or an adaptation) is xerox, just copy and paste: you don't have to add anything. If you change the original story and keep only the basic idea, well you are a thief and a lazy artist without any talent! I never see the original movie by Wise but it's a classic: flying saucers land in bright day, then a cyclopean alien robot gets out but humans have only guns and violence for welcome.(Beyond, Wise left a tasteful cinematography because he keeps popping out lately: this movie, Star Trek and ""the Haunting"" reviewed by the King himself in his ""Danse Macabre"". As would have said another master, PKD, Science-fiction isn't about feelings but rather with ideas, thus a good storyteller can only be attracted by this thematic).Here, the production went silly: First, they wanted to redesign Gork. They draw hideous sketches (see the bonus) until one day, a guy said simply that Gork was a faceless human, thus back to the original design.Then, they had to transform him in nanorobots (that look like as our well-know insects): stupid! They seem to eat the human creations but left New York untouched! Gone too the saucer (it's too tied to the 50's), replaced by bubbles that arrive at night! What's a chilling moment and i wonder if they have heard about X-Files.The only thing they got nearly right was the cast: it's always great to see Keanu, Jenni and Sir Cleese. The son of Will Smith is fine but he hasn't the smile of his father and the writer wrecked his part, being unable to write decent lines with his stepmother! In conclusion, throw it away and keep up with the original!",The Day the Earth Stood Still
54,TheMovieDiorama,The Day The Earth Stood Still moves less frequently than Keanu Reeves' expressionless face.,3,15 July 2019,"Wise's original 1951 black-and-white sci-fi was a landmark of the genre, exploring an allegory of human violence that expressed the impression of post-WWII society. Naturally, with Hollywood's idea pool drying up quicker than Bates' career, a remake was commissioned. And here we are. A special effects extravaganza absent of a coherent story and so heavy-handed in its execution, that it's the equivalent of being backhanded by Reeves (ouch!). A space ball descends onto Manhattan, where an alien humanoid turns into Keanu Reeves and warns humanity that if they do not change their ways, they will be forcibly decimated for the betterment of the planet.Whilst still loosely based on the original short story 'Farewell to the Master', it mostly replaces the primary theme of societal violence with environmental damage. I say mostly, only because it still tries to explore the former at a pedestrian level. This is a fine replacement, after all a remake should be distinguishable from the original, however the direction it takes is near incomprehensible. For about half the film, we see Connelly (doing the best she can with the shoddy screenplay) running around woodland areas with her son, a young Jaden Smith, whilst expressively fighting with him with their opposing ideologies. He believes we should fight, she strongly disagrees. A microcosm of societal warfare, if you will. But it's so heavy-handed, so forced and so unnatural, that I found myself shouting at the TV on multiple occasions.Connelly letting Klaatu escape, despite knowing him/it for a total of five minutes. The ridiculously urgent character change in Klaatu during the third act. The sheer stupidity of the US military. So many dumb character choices, that it forces this sci-fi into ""low-fi"" territory. The inclusion of Cleese's character is just to ram the philosophy of collaborative evolution down our throats. Remove him, and the film may have been better off without the inefficient storytelling! Then we get to the relentless swarm of nano-machines that devour man-made objects (and human flesh for that matter!), simply included to showcase special effects that were instantly forgettable.When any film, let alone a remake, aspires to push visual effects ahead of narrative execution, well the results are not going to be kind. Sadly for this ""re-imagining"", the minor points on altruism, creationism and the performances of Reeves and Connelly is not nearly enough to prevent this from being one of the worst remakes in recent memory. They even mishandled the infamous ""Klaatu Barada nikto"" quote, and forced him to kill humans!",The Day the Earth Stood Still

56,BaronBl00d,Empty Remake Void of Original's Heart and Mind and Acting Skill,4,20 March 2010,"I love the Robert Wise original for an array of reasons: the story is just so engaging, it has an allegorical, underlying subtext, its cheapish yet lovable special effects, Michael Rennie and Billy Gray and Patricia Neal and so on, the line ""Klaatu Beratta Nickto(or however it is spelled), and its various peripheral messages such as how the media makes more tragedy and creates panic through manipulation of their trade - a major problem looming now and assuredly one that will grow and grow and grow. Certainly a remake would make drastic changes. The Red Scare was prevalent in the time of that first film - so it played a large part in it. But this remake makes a lot of huge, unnecessary changes with the characters and the story and really the original purpose. The original film showed that an alien wanted to offer mankind an opportunity to change. This film really does not - or not tome in a convincing manner. Keanu Reeves is no Michael Rennie. He is rather bland in this though does perform better than what I expected. He is not curious at all about mankind. He shuffles through one scene after another. Gone are the poignant scenes with him and the child - though an attempt is made at a cemetery. That brings me to a big problem for me; Jaden Smith. You know the actor-son of Will Smith. I think the young man has some talent, but he is miscast in this film. I didn't care about him at all nor his relationship with his mother or Reeves. He was more annoying than anything. Jennifer Connely isn't much better. But let's be fair - the script is muddled trying to infuse an old idea with new ones and ending up creating a mess. This film could have done so much more with it if it had had a good script treatment and find some character acting with depth. Only John Cleese as Professor Barnhardt gives a likable performance. Kathy Bates plays an important role but her actions are not very logical. Yes, there are a load of special effects like little metal bugs that eat their way through everything and huge spherical orbs that begin to take the species on earth like a Noah's Ark. All this was masking tape to cover up the threadbare grip the script had on telling or in this case retelling a great story. What a pity that producers today must constantly go back and borrow the ideas of the past because they lack new, creative ones, but they nonetheless feel compelled to bastardize those original ideas so much as to alienate the people that would have been loyal to the original and its ideas and rather play down to a new audience with whom they have so little regard.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
57,digitalbeachbum,'F' for The Day The Earth Was FUBAR,1,14 September 2013,"The original movie had a moral to learn. Humanity vs technology. Humanity vs the atomic age. Humanity against humanity.
This remake of a movie has no moral to teach or learn. It is a cluster !@#$ of CGI and super star power, wasted because the director and writers know nothing about how to write a good story.If you are going to make a remake of a classic, either make another classic or make an awesome tribute to a classic.
If you do anything else, be prepared to be labeled as a money grubbing bullcrap artist.The original movie is a masterpiece, a classic for all generations. It had a tiny budget far less than this failure of a remake and still is one of the best all time sci-fi movies of all time.
Was the original perfect? No, but you take the failures of an old movie and take them in to consideration because of the lack of special effects and camera gear, etc.How can people who have an 80 million dollar budge blow it on a remake? I'll tell you how.
You get an overpriced star like Keanu Reeves (who I like, just not in this role) and get a director like Scott Derrickson (who???) to remake a classic.
Also sprinkle a little of Jaden Smith (barf) on top.Let's pause for a moment.
Who the heck is Scott Derrickson? Look at the movies he has directed?
Who is David Scarpa?
The closest good movie was Scott Derrickson with Dr. Strange and even that was a !@#$ !@#$ of a movie which barely scraped by with a really crappy ending.Edmund H. North is still listed as a writer for this movie, because he was the original writer for the original classic movie.

59,Anonymous_Maxine,Police Search For Escaped Convict Amidst Global Alien Invasion  'The Day The Earth Stood Still' Review,6,24 February 2009,"It was with great anticipation that I watched The Day The Earth Stood Still. Special effects have improved enormously in the almost 60 years that have passed since the making of the original film, which was released in 1951. Keanu Reeves seems the perfect choice for the role, given that he is born in the movie not unlike his bizarre birth in The Matrix Reloaded. But the movie is never able to shake the impression that it's a cheap, almost direct-to-DVD sci fi thriller with a weak story and bad special effects. The performances are about as good as can be expected, but the movie showcases some of the worst CGI I've seen in years. The set-up at least works well enough. The government has tracked an object moving through space and, through a series of spectacularly detailed calculations, they decide that not only is the object going to directly impact earth, but it's going to land right in the middle of Manhattan. Looks like New York is still having some bad luck in the movies. I was really curious to know how they discovered that exact location, but during the ominous speech about the object's imminent arrival, it was explained that the object was moving at ""3x10 to the 7th meters/second."" That's movie talk for ""don't bother trying to understand this part, it will be over in a minute.""It is determined that there is no use starting an evacuation, because the area contains 8 million people and the object is expected to hit in 78 minutes. They have a countdown clock and everything, which works out nicely for the plot.Surely I'm not spoiling anything if I explain that the object slows down as it approaches earth, right? This is, of course, a unique alien invasion. They haven't come in peace or to take over or to save the human race from ourselves, but to save the earth from the human race. It's a pretty bald-faced political statement for a science fiction movie to make, but it doesn't necessarily take away from the movie's effectiveness or entertainment value. What really costs it are the bad special effects. The object itself that lands in New York's Central Park is certainly a special effects achievement, if a conspicuously unimaginative one. It's a giant Sphere that looks like the earth in the middle of a global storm, and a bizarre creature emerges from it.Anyone who has seen E.T. will notice a definitely familiar presentation of the authorities. Jennifer Connolly plays a scientist who has been mysteriously whisked away to the site under strange circumstances (sort of exactly like the beginning of Sphere), and her shock is almost immediately replaced with a fascination that is suddenly shattered by the automatically violent human response. The creature emerging from the Sphere is shot on sight and promptly dies.This all happens within the first 15 or 20 minutes of the movie, of course. Soon an alien life form in the form of Keanu Reeves emerges (think of the bizarre shifting bodysuit that Reeves wore in A Scanner Darkly) and informs Connoly that he and the group of civilizations that he represents are here to save the earth from humankind. ""If the earth dies, you die,"" He explains. ""If you die, the earth survives.""Logically, it's kind of hard to argue with that.The movie is basically a lashing out at the human (American?) propensity towards violence, probably most directly illustrated in one scene where the U.S. military attempts to blow up the giant metal man that emerges from the ship. When the attempt fails completely, the commander in charge is fresh out of ideas. There's also the small issue that Jennifer Connoly's husband was killed in Iraq, leaving her son (Jayden Smith) fatherless. This is an anti-war movie, ladies and gentlemen.As a piece of political science fiction, the movie is much more entertaining than you might think, but less than I expected. There are no problems accepting Reeves as an alien taking on human form, and even the issue of his ability to speak English is acknowledged, although mostly in suggesting that he can speak any language he wants. In one scene, he has a conversation with one of his colleagues who has been living on earth as a Chinese man for 70 years, and he explains that it's hopeless to try to talk to these people, they'll never change. It's perfect, by the way, that this kind of thing would come from a Chinese, given that he has spent the better part of a century living in a country that, even in the 21st century, teaches its young people never to talk to westerners about things like government or politics because they can never understand the Chinese way. I had been under the impression that The Day The Earth Stood Still was going to be a bigger production than it is. It was marketed well and has a good cast, but it just has too much of the look and feel of a lower budget production, and borrows far too heavily and too obviously from so many other, generally better, science fiction films, from E.T. and Sphere to The Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Independence Day, and War of the Worlds (another 1950s sci-fi remake which was remade better than this). It's not a disappointment, fans of the genre are almost sure to be thrilled, but it doesn't have the scope that a film of this caliber should have had.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

This mostly star quality than sci-fi quality. If anyone remember the original version, they can tell the difference. The one thing I liked about this version is when the swarm took out everything in its path. No regular pesticides can take them out. Meeting his Chinese counterpart at McDonald's was a lot of fun. Plenty of great stars, lots of sponsors, not a lot of hoopla, this movie got a lot give for sci-fi fans. Will Smith is definitely proud of his son's performance.

61,robert-temple-1,The Day the Film Jammed,1,21 June 2009,"This film is lost, lost, lost, and going nowhere. It has been misconceived, has no point, is overdone like a burnt steak, and just think of all the money they wasted on producing this rambling, directionless, self-indulgent failure. Strangely enough, I rather liked the central performance by Keanu Reeves as the visiting alien. Some people might say it was wooden and inexpressive. But it was chillingly convincing, and more or less the way an alien of that sort would act (I know several, they come from a rival planet, and would never be allowed on mine). I actually admired the sturdy determination of Reeves to maintain continuity of mood throughout this mayhem, where crazy things were happening all around him and he had to put up with Jennifer Connelly and her obnoxious, thoroughly revolting brat. Why on earth (even if it were standing still) did anyone choose Jennifer Connelly for the role of the woman? (One cannot call her the 'love interest' because Keanu Reeves, as an alien with no expression, is above such things, or below them, or whatever.) Even when they are trapped in a car on long dangerous drives, looking at each other meaningfully, the meaning has nothing to do with males and females but more to do with dogs and cats. Connelly looks haunted, but for the wrong reasons. She seems not to have slept in ten years. She really should take a holiday and freshen up. Why are her eyes so sunken and tired? She does not add any zip to the action, she makes us want to go have a nap or we will look like her. Reeves has never looked better, even when he was a young buck with doe eyes (is that a contradiction?) The DVD of this film offers us the original film starring Michael Rennie as an extra. 'Oldies but goodies!' Bring back the days when they knew how to make a science fiction film properly for only a tiny budget and impress the hell out of us! The worst thing about the film is the appalling son of Jennifer Connelly. I don't want to mention the unfortunate boy actor's name, I just want to point out that the whole thing stinks. What is this obsession they have in Hollywood with putting disgusting children in every film who then have to be worshipped by cringeing, apologetic, neurotic parents? Is it because all parents are now cringeing and neurotic? Or all children have now become that offensive, sneering, sulky, and arrogant? And has anyone noticed that Connelly is as white as parchment while her 'son' is, well, what shall I say? I don't want to commit a 'hate crime' by pointing out that he differs rather extremely in hue. As we all know, we aren't permitted anymore to mention any skin colour other than white without getting arrested. But isn't this carrying black tokenism in films to insane extremes? What a mess. Further comment about this meandering, unfocused, pointless exercise in cinematic vanity would be an offense to those electrons who sacrifice their lives to appear on our computer screens. Or should I now say those liquid crystals who offer themselves for annihilation on the altar of a potassium carbonate plastic glass, so that we may all read and write in cyberspace? This is a sci fi review, after all. (And as for the plague of metal locusts in the film, come on! Let's get unreal!)",The Day the Earth Stood Still
62,Chris Knipp,Klaatu barada nikto,7,13 December 2008,"Every so often one feels like an alien. Why is everybody else so wrong all the time? Why do people--humans, that is--insist in driving like total morons? Why do I know what the world's leaders should be doing, but they don't? It makes one feel so hopeless. Then one hears a snatch of Bach. It's transcendently beautiful. One realizes Bach too, technically anyway, was a human. And so the race must be saved. We can't throw out the Bach with the bath, can we? That's what this movie's about, more or less. It's based on the 1951 Robert Wise sci-fi classic. In the original, followed here in many outward respects, a superior being who's assumed human form came to earth with a giant robot called Gort. They represented an intergalactic organization of peaceable cultures who wanted to save us from nuclear destruction.Nowadays the planet is more infested with nuclear bombs and bomb-makers than ever, but fashions in paranoia having changed, in 2008 the alien arrives with an Inconvenient Truth. Our habits are destroying the earth, and since only a few planets can sustain life, this matters. We don't turn out to be too amenable to discussion, or even friendly, toward this visitor. It might have helped if he'd said he was coming. Everybody thought his space ship was a meteor that was going to destroy Manhattan. Anyway, almost the minute he walks out the door into Central Park he's met with a barrage of heavy weaponry and sustains a serious bullet wound. It just gets worse from there, and the more he sees of us, the more he's convinced that we're just a heedless, headstrong species. To save the planet he therefore decides we, and all our stuff, have simply got to go.Precisely because Fifties sci-fi was crude technically, it worked better as fable. As the effects have grown, they've taken up the space for ideas and the time for people to talk. This new 'Day' hasn't changed the traditional sci-fi trappings: hysterical mobs; clumps of concerned citizens, experts, and leaders. Weaponry; men in uniform, commanders barking useless orders; shimmering spaceships; stalking monsters. Screens flashing technical information. A blackboard covered with mysterious equations only the smartest guys understand. This time invading critters have been added; and CGI, if not of the finest quality. All of which may delight an eight-year-old boy, but doesn't add up to much because this isn't a very good movie. It's not a terrible one either, and it does give one that am-I-an-alien? feeling. But it is probably less thought-provoking than the original, partly because of the emphasis on the effects, and partly because the writing and direction are not top-drawer.The President has fled to an undisclosed location, like Dick Cheney, and the main authority figure is, presciently for our time, a female Secretary of Defense--Kathy Bates, in a lame, back-and-forth role.There's a smart, plucky woman astrobiologist, and Jennifer Connelly is good at that. There's a cute, uncooperative kid, her foster son, and Jaden Smith (son of Will) is good at that. And Keanu Reeves, as Klaatu, makes a super alien. But his dialogue is limp and preachy and after a while it goes stale. He never gets to deliver the most famous robot-language line in the literature, ""Klaatu barada nikto,"" which was a ""safe-word"" phrase designed to be used in an emergency, if necessary, to save Klaatu and stop Gort from destroying the earth. Neither does the ""earth stand still"" to demonstrate Klaatu's power to earthlings and convince them they must change, as in the original movie.On the run with Helen (Connolly) and Jacob (Smith) after being confined and interrogated, Klaatu meets a Chinese alien in a Macdonald's who's lived on earth seventy years and has come to like humans. (Doubtless he's been here too long and should have been reassigned.) Klaatu also encounters a a Nobel scientist (John Cleese), with the blackboard full of equations and a nice rug. This is where Klaatu hears the snatch of Bach and realizes humans can make beautiful things.The best thing about aliens is that they have a human side. Klaatu is nice enough to reconsider wiping out the human species, even after he's unleashed a plague upon us. Can he even stop it? The ending is muffled and anticlimactic. Kids, or the kid in you, will like the CGI swarms of viruses that invade everything and fly around in the form of metallic locusts. They gobble a freeway sign in nanoseconds and a whole giant truck speeding down the highway in not much longer. But in doing this, they also gobble up time the movie might have had to mean something more. And due to the writing, Keanu/Klaatu, though in his conception and how he's introduced he's more convincingly alien than Robert Wise's, comes to seem a Johnny One Note, which nothing to offer us but his pathetic lack of affect and his tiny, half-convincing movement toward pity. One remembers, and misses, the delight of Jeff Bridges' alien in John Carpenter's 'Starman', a film full of inventive writing such as this lacks.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
63,elshikh4,"Good movie, starring a piece of wood !",6,13 November 2011,"I was told that this is bad. It isn't.. entirely.Jennifer Connelly and Jaden Smith are fine. The CGI is entertaining. The script is breathless. There is a nice message about love as something that equals life. And some imagination impressed me; like the way how the giant robot destroyed its jailers. However, the ""bad"".. was elsewhere.Scriptwise I couldn't figure out who was ""Klaatu"" anyway? What was his mission? And how he managed to defeat or cancel the invasion at the end?! Well, I couldn't answer because the script didn't have interest in showing any answer in the first place. So, it was provocatively vogue; as if we were following a movie with deleted scenes!After the problem, get ready to the tragedy. Do you wait me to spell it for you? OK, KEAAAAAANU REEEEEEVES! This round, the man hit a new degree of wooden. And the painful matter is that I believe he gets worse and worse as an actor with every movie (so watch out of his next!). I used to say that whenever Hollywood has a bad actor they deal with him easily by the method of ""Let's make him a robot"". Well, it worked big time with Arnold Schwarzenegger, but not here. I bet any real alien would see Keanu as Klaatu would sue the production company for denigrating his image!John Cleese didn't stay for much. Kathy Bates was wasted in a role that I couldn't believe her with. The editing rushed many points, or maybe the movie, from the start, was meant to be another pure 90 min B movie, nothing more. I felt the scenes of the military's headquarter were too loud to comedic extent; especially the one of ""Destroy the giant, OH MY GOD, he destroyed us!""So, there is something to watch, something to think about, and something to bother. Though, (The Day the Earth Stood Still) proved itself eventually as balanced entertainment-with-meaning that fits a novella. It assures that after half a century what did change in Hollywood is that it became more flashy in special effects, less talented in writing stories!Finally, a point I can't hold; the movie's end is about having a second chance. In respect of Keanu nowadays, it became very hard to give him ""a"" chance in the first place!",The Day the Earth Stood Still

"" Over the years, a majority of fans have agreed, for it's time was quite remarkable. In 2008 a remake arrived and this is the result. In comparing the two, there is little similarity. In the original Black and White version audiences were immediately snared and captivated with an eerie and haunting theme which signaled impending doom, The newer version has neither a haunting theme, nor the ominous feel of one. The 1951 movie had an impressive atomic power Spaceship, here audiences are treated to a gigantic mother Orb and thousands of smaller copies, imitating the crafts of Independence Day. When the spaceship landed in 51' Michael Rennie offered 'Peace and Good Will' the military replied with gunfire. In 1951, America was infected with an epidemic virus of Fear and suspicion. In 2008, little has changed, except perhaps the virus now included the feminine strain of Suspicion and Fear, but the military still responds with gunfire. In the 1950's when Klattu is wounded, his incredible robot named Gort, easily disarms the feeble army. Here despite all the advances in military weaponry, they are still unable to match Gort. nevertheless, the space visitor takes to the streets in able to learn. In 2008, Humans have evolved little, except to realize they are responsible for the deleterious condition of the Earth.

With Patricia Neal helping Klattu in the 50' audiences expected similar in 08'. However adapting to the times, Klaatu (Keanu Reeves) is met by Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) who is now a PHD. In addition, Mr. Harley, Personal Sect. to the president is replaced by Kathy Bates, Sec. Def Regina Jackson. Both are equally inept at understanding the visitor. In the final analyst between the two versions, the original conveyed the message, eliminate your ignorance and aggression or face obliteration, in the new film, the director has eliminated the first segment and opts for obliteration.

65,DarkVulcan29,"Not good or bad, but okay.",7,15 December 2008,"I Will probably watch the 1951 classic version soon, when it comes on AMC again, I'm sure back in the day, The Day The Earth Sood Still was considered a masterpiece, but today considering the successes of Close Encunters Of The Third Kind(1978), Stargate(1994), The Arrival(1996), and Indapendence Day(1996). It pretty much is nothing spectacular.Dr. Helen Benson(Jennifer Connelly) is suddenly called fr a secret mission, when an alien visitor and a giant alien robot named Gort, come to earth, when Helen tries to greet it, a nervous soldier shoots it wounds it. The alien is brought to a hospital on the base, were it begins to morph into human form, and we learn his name to be Klaatu(Keanu Reeves), and he says he wants to speak to earths leaders. But the people on the base worry about an invasion, they keep Klaatu prisoner. But Helen feels that Klaatu intentions are not what they appear, she sets him free, She and her step son(Jaden Smith) go on the run with Klaatu, in hopes to figure out the real reason he has come to earth.This was not great, but not truly awful either. Keanu Reeves gives a commendable performance as the emotionless alien Klaatu, he is like Mr. Spock, minus the ears and eyebrows. And Jennifer Connelly is also good. Although Reeves and Connelly have good chemistry, but that never evolves real far has it should. But Jaden Smith really got on my nerves, although he is just a kid, but he never shuts up. And Kathy Bates character I think loves more the sound of her voice, then anything else. The effects are alright, but not great.

66,strong-122-478885,The Day The Earth Got Stupid And Went To McDonalds,1,10 July 2013,"Put bluntly, to compare this dreadful remake to the glowing, 1951 original would be like comparing a bucket of steaming vomit to, say, a garden of delicate violets, or something to that general effect. (I think that you get my point) One of the many, many questions that came to my mind (while wasting away 2 hours of my life here) was - Were the filmmakers of this stinkin' excuse for a remake really so bloody conceited as to believe that they were actually improving on the original? And, my guess on that question is - Yes. They really were that frickin' conceited about their precious movie.So, where-oh-where, do I begin to give this rotten piece of Sci-Fi garbage the royal trashing that it so rightly deserves? Like, how many new levels of sheer stupidity can one movie stoop to before it falls flat on its face? I'd say that it usually only takes stooping to one or two levels of stupidity, but, this remake achieved multiple levels of stupidity, falling on its face, over, and over, and over again. (ho-hum!) OK. First I think I'll take a stab at criticizing this remake's visual effects.Let's face it, the whirling sphere effect sucked, big time. Had it been presented in a rainbow of brilliant colors, or something, then, yeah, that would've been so cool. But as it was, it was a mighty meager and unforgivably dismal replacement for a spaceship.When I added up all of the expensive CG effects together as a whole they were certainly nowhere near to being an acceptable substitute for plot logic, character development, and intelligent dialog.To me, the overall inferiority of these visuals proved, beyond a doubt, that the special effects created for the original, 1951 version were far superior to these in every way imaginable.When it came to this remake's story (if you could call it that) - It totally killed me that this hypocritical, little flick actually preached that well-worn cliché which warns us all that ""Violence is not the answer to solving our problems"" - And, yet, all that this film was about was excessive violence (for its own sake?).And - In the name of humanity, military action was taken against the alien visitor even before he was given half a chance to state the purpose of his arrival.I have to say that I really resented this picture's blatant product placement tactics. But, then again, how fitting it was that an all-important meeting (of profound significance) which took place between Klaatu and a fellow alien-being was done over cokes in a crappy, old McDonalds.Yeah. That just about summed up the intellectual relevance of this irrelevant remake in a literal nutshell.And, finally - Allow me to briefly express my opinion about 4 of this film's principal actors and their subsequent characters.1st - Jennifer Connelly was neither convincing nor likable as Helen Benson, a scientist and a mother. As an actress Connelly is a completely brain-dead bimbo.2nd - Kathy Bates was absolutely atrocious as Regina Jackson, the Secretary of Defense. With her ""shoot-first-ask-questions-later"" attitude, she was like a bull-dyke truck-driver, literally, bulldozing her way through her part without even the least bit of insight or sensitivity.3rd - Keanu Reeves was just like a piece of petrified of wood as the alien, Klaatu. Like, doesn't this no-talent goof know any other facial expressions besides that of a blank stare? 4th - Jaden Smith's character, as Jacob Benson, had one of the biggest hands in ruining this picture for me.This whiny, snot-nosed, despicable, little suck was worse than the Newt character was in Aliens. You can bet that if this rotten, little twerp hadn't been Will Smith's son then he would've never, ever landed a part in this film.Jaden's whole presence made my skin just crawl like you wouldn't believe. If only his character had been annihilated early on in the story. That way I would've surely rated this lousy remake somewhat higher than I did.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
67,ebiros2,Klaatu brings far more grimmer message to Earth than the '51 version,5,28 May 2011,"Messenger comes from outer space to exterminate human race - a kind of ""Your worst nightmare about alien invasion just came true."" scenario sums up this movie.This is not the diplomatic Klaatu that showed up in the '51 version of the movie, but he's gun ho from the start to get rid of the human race. US tries their favorite solutions to all problems of this type - use military might to destroy the problem. Except they just try to shoot the messenger. The real problem turns out - to be us.Everything they've changed from the '51 masterpiece turned out to be a crap in this movie. First of all there's absolutely no reason in this one for the world to stop. The situation was just tacked on, so in a way, the movie really doesn't reflect its title. There's inconsistencies everywhere, like if Klaatu came not as a diplomat, but as a grim reaper, why would he have to land on earth to begin with ? He could have just stayed in orbit, or just send GORT to do the job. Instead he goes through this very painful metamorphosis to become human. Why did the Chinese alien guy arrive at his conclusion ? If he was sending his periodic messages, he could have communicated why he would prefer to stay rather than to leave, and that would have been a big swing vote for the galactic council. Earth people acted like fools too. There were no intelligence in what was done - just fear and belligerence governing their action - proving more that galactic council's conclusion is right. '51 version had much culture and communication between the two parties which made it so good and entertaining. This one took all that away, replacing it by fools who thinks they're smart.There was this very annoying kid that played the part of Jennifer Connery's adopted son. The kid's acting was annoying, the part was annoying, and added absolutely nothing to the plot. I wish they could have exterminated him first while watching the movie. So, not a very good remake of the original in my opinion. Like the War of the Worlds, this remake was inferior to the original which were classics of the '50s sci-fi along with ""The Forbidden Planet"".",The Day the Earth Stood Still
68,dfranzen70,"Updated remake will make you stand still, jaw agape",7,13 December 2008,"The Day the Earth Stood Still is remade as a taut, electric thriller that's updated to shift humanity's crime from ""being bad to one another"" to ""assaulting the environment."" It's well cast, particularly with Keanu Reeves as Klaatu and Jennifer Connelly as Dr. Helen Benson, and it lags only when the action departs, which isn't too often at all. In all, it's a clever redo that will capture the viewer's imagination even if they've seen the original.The key word here is ""update."" I think that if you're going to remake a classic, you should do so if you can show a different angle, a new twist, to the original plot without decimating the original premise in the process. Here, director Scott Derrickson stays true to Klaatu's main point - fly right or fall - while altering some aspects of the original to better suit the times. For example, the robot Gort isn't just a big metal thing, he/it is a metal-organic hybrid, because naturally alien civilizations might have advanced past mere robotics.So why is Klaatu here, anyway? Well, in general terms he's here to warn us to mend our ways, or else, but he doesn't get too far by trying to reason with us. As one might expect, since we don't take kindly to aliens landing in Central Park. Klaatu is eventually apprehended and interrogated, just as we'd expect the narrow-minded government to do. And he meets up with Dr. Helen Benson (Connelly), a macrobiologist called in by the feds to figure out what the heck's going on.Connelly and Reeves interact well, although it's tough to tell sometimes, since Klaatu isn't supposed to be the emotive type. But of course, neither is Reeves, which is why he's so well cast. In fact, perfectly so. Klaatu is measured in his responses and actions, and you never really know what his plans are; Reeves enigmatic demeanor is suitable. Connelly is believable as the single-(step)mom/superdoctor, too. She and Reeves aren't love interests here, which also contributes a lot to the efficacy of the plot. Too often straightforward stories are derailed somewhat by a forced romance angle. Not here. In this remake, the conflicts between man and alien, man and man, man and self are at center stage.And that gets at the crux of why this movie works: the impending doom of the planet is shown so vividly that you can't help but feel fearful yourself. Will Dr. Benson be able to convince Klaatu that the humans should be saved? What will happen, specifically, if she cannot? Her trepidation grips you; knowing that the fate of the planet's dominant species rests on your shoulders is a fearsome burden.The downsides? Well, there aren't many, to be sure, but they do kind of hurt. Jaden (son of Will) Smith is cast as Benson's stepson, and he's surly and unforgiving and combative and just plain unlikable. Which isn't strictly young Master Smith's fault, certainly, but it makes it awfully hard to feel sympathy toward him. It's a little gallling, too, to see his attitude turn on a dime, in mere seconds, as if the first 45 minutes were just a big joke.I also wasn't too pleased with Kathy Bates as the secretary of defense, who's inexplicably left in charge of matters after the arrival of Klaatu and Gort. (Why not the president or veep? Oh, they're moved to separate undisclosed locations, where apparently they can't do anything.) Autocratic, illogical commanders are a dime a dozen in the movies, and Bates feels completely wasted here.Still, this remake really is a lot of fun, particularly during the high-octane action scenes, which are understandable despite being infused with CGI. In this case, it appears that the CGI works very well - check out the giant robot Gort and how it reacts to being shot at. Technically speaking, very well done indeed.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
69,kevin_robbins,This is kind of a bland version of Independence Day,5,31 July 2021,"The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008) is currently available on Tubi. The storyline follows an alien and large robot that land in Central Park. The alien is accompanied by a mom and her little boy who have gone through their own struggles and are excited about the possibilities the alien brings to their world. Little do they know the alien is preparing the world for its destruction. This movie is directed by Scott Derrickson (Hellraiser: Inferno) and stars Keanu Reeves (The Matrix), Jennifer Connely (Requiem for a Dream), Kathy Bates (Misery), Jaden Smith (The Karate Kid) and John Cleese (A Fish called Wanda). The storyline for this has far more action than the original but is a little more bland overall. I did love the fluidity and impact the robot made and Reeves had the perfect demeanor for the alien. The relationship between daughter and stepson is well delivered throughout the film. Overall this is kind of a bland version of Independence Day and just okay overall.

70,PWNYCNY,Strong performance by Keanu Reeves in a mediocre remake.,6,15 December 2008,"Although lacking in the moody intensity of the original and without the services of Michael Rennie and Patricia Neal, this movie is still watchable and for one reason, the presence of Keanu Reeves. Mr. Reeves gives a commanding performance as Klatu and saves this movie from becoming another sci-fi joke. The robot Gort is ridiculous and the special effects rather overdone, but Mr. Reeves manages to keep the story interesting if not compelling. In addition, although an integral part of the plot, after making a dramatic entrance, Gort is somewhat marginalized and is literally placed in a package which really removes it from the action. Gort in a box? I don't think so. One of the movie's more glaring drawbacks is that it does not clearly show how Klatu succeeds in conveying his message of doom to the entire world; he manages to wreak havoc everywhere but whether all of humanity connects up the havoc with the message is unclear. Also, Klatu's apparent change of mind is not fully explored leaving the one to wonder why he changed his mind. One thing is for certain, however, and that is to try to be nice to your visitors even if they come from other planets.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
71,dee.reid,Not a great day for the Earth to Stand Still,5,3 December 2009,"Upon hearing that a remake of one of my favorite sci-fi movies of all time, 1951's ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" was on its way to being remade, I wasn't surprised. I mean, after all, with its minimal special effects and action sequences and character-driven story, it was destined to be remained sooner or later as the latest Hollywood special effects bonanza.I also didn't think much about Keanu Reeves being cast as beloved spaceman icon Klaatu; never mind his impassively wooden performance, which sort of just tramples over the bewildering gentlemanly performance of the late great British actor Michael Rennie. Even that can't really save the movie from being just a big special effects disappointment.The original ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" an adaptation of the Harry Bates short story ""Farewell to the Master,"" was the great sci-fi classic of its time. Made at the beginning of the Cold War, it was a brave political statement against the conflict (or lack thereof), and the insanity that had invaded the American psyche at that time. And the film caught hell for it, as well as a Golden Globe for ""Best Film Promoting International Understanding.""Such vibes are not present in this glossy 2008 remake. The original's anti-war message has been replaced by an environmentalist subtext. Now I'm for saving the environment, but this seriously undermines the urgency of Klaatu's mission for coming here. Klaatu deemed that we were not only a threat to ourselves, but to other planets as well. That was why his mission was so urgent. We just don't get that here. That was my biggest gripe with this picture.Of course Klaatu (Reeves) has come to us from another planet with a warning to save the environment, or face annihilation if we don't. He's held hostage by the U.S. government, escapes, and becomes an unlikely ally to astro-physicist Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) and her stepson Jacob (Jaden Smith). And it soon becomes clear they are the only thing standing between us and total annihilation.I already outlined by biggest gripe with Scott Derrickson's remake. There's was just a lot wrong with this picture from the get-go, as in it just should not have been made. ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (1951) is hands-down one of the most important sci-fi pictures ever made, and also one of the greatest of all time. This movie has some great special effects sequences, to be totally fair to the filmmakers, but unfortunately they just can't save this movie from being another Hollywood special effects spectacle with no heart or soul.This ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" just stands still and nothing more.5/10",The Day the Earth Stood Still
72,JoeB131,Klaatu's (Not so) Excellent Adventure...,1,14 December 2008,"The new version of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" should be offered as a lesson in everything that is wrong with Hollywood today. Robert Wise's 1951 version is perfectly fine on its own, and there was no reason to remake it. The movie begins with a scene where a mountain climber in 1928 encounters a sphere, which collects his DNA to produce a clone who looks just like Keanu Reeves eighty years later. The scene is completely unnecessary and is handled better by exposition later in the movie. Flash forward to the present, where Jennifer Connelly is a scientist and a single adoptive mother. (Keep in mind, the equivalent character in the 1951 version was a simple government worker, and that was just fine.) The government grabs her to prepare for the impeding arrival of an unknown space object. Well, this is pretty much the setup for the 1951 version, the UFO lands, and its occupant is shot by a nervous soldier. The robot Gort emerges from the spacecraft and mixes it up with military. Except now Gort is 40 feet tall and rendered by CGI. The alien Klaatu is rushed to the hospital, where his request to address the UN is refused by Kathy Bates playing the Evil Government Lady. (Incidentally, more of liberal Hollywood – the US is portrayed as the 'bad guys'.) What follows is Klaatu escaping from the Secret Government Facility, and then proceeding to meet with another of his kind who's been here for seventy years. (And they meet at a McDonald's. Isn't Mickey Dee part of the problem?) They mutually conclude humanity can't be reasoned with. Now, the 1951 version was topical because it was only a few years after WWII, and humans were creating weapons capable of destroying the planet. It was a cautionary tale. This one tries a cautionary tale as well, we mean old humans are slowly destroying the planet, so these advanced aliens are going to destroy it quickly after extracting the snail darters and spotted owls. Yup, the environmental reasoning of people who fly around on private jets They aren't the problem, you are! Connelly's character convinces Klaatu to meet with one of our great scientists, played by John Cleese (Actually, the former Python gives the only decent performance in the film.) Unfortunately, Cleese asks the sensible question, if you're so worried, use your advanced technology to fix the problem. Oh, wait, can't do that. We'll just exterminate your whole species and most of the others and then reseed the planet. Yeah, that makes more sense than slightly adjusting the CO2 level in your atmosphere. Well, a bunch of actions scenes later, which should have convinced Klaatu that we are a bunch of homicidal maniacs, he changes his mind and decides to save humanity. Except by this time, Gort has converted into a swarm on flesh and metal eating Nano-bots that proceed to expand over the east coast. The end of the movie is Klaatu calls off the nano-Gorts, but renders all technology on the planet inert. Of course, this makes no sense. That wouldn't just 'change our lifestyle', it would result in 6 billion people dependent on industrial agriculture starving to death, leveling forests to keep warm, probably eating some of those endangered species to stay alive. Missing are the 1951's version's Christian allegories. In the classic, Klaatu comes to us with an important message, lives amongst us as ""Mr. Carpenter"" (who else was a Carpenter?) is betrayed and killed, but rises from the dead. Before he ascends back in to the Heavens, he gives us an important message that we need to straighten up our act. This one has no such subtlety, it's just an excuse for CGI and action sequences. Okay, lessons to be learned class. 1) If a movie was perfectly good the first time around, it doesn't need to be remade. If it wasn't, then there's no need to try again. 2) Special Effects are NOT a substitute for plot logic, character development or dialog. Neither are action scenes. 3) Keanu Reeves still can't act. 4) Product Placement by corporations that are part of the problem you are whining about undercut your message. 5) No need to beat us over the head with the message. We had to listen to the annoying kid whine about his dead father for most of the film. Wise handled this with subtly. We see a tombstone with the name and ""Anzio"" written on it. Got the point across.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
73,XweAponX,Basically the same story as the 1951 version,10,14 April 2009,"Having seen the original 1951 film a googolplex of times, and reading the original Harry Bates short story (Which has very limited association to the film of 1951)- The intent of the original story was more than lost in these films, it was totally ignored. That's what I said when I saw this in the theater.After subsequent viewings, I now say that they stayed true to the original Edward M North screenplay.The only surviving element in all three is the name of the Robot GORT.Between this film and the original, we have the names of Gort and the ""alien"" Klaatu, and possibly the names ""Benson"" and ""Barnhardt"".This film begins with, instead of a ""Flying Saucer"" being detected and responded to by the US Military and the eventual landing at The Mall in Washington DC... A short ""Flashback"" to 1928 to the Karakoram Mountains of India where we see a non-named Keanu Reeves character interacting with a spherical globule of some kind... And as much as I wish I could insert a spoiler here, I cannot, due to the fact that these spherical globules are not explained in any shape or form. Actually, this intro is vaguely explained... In one sentence of a discussion while Klaatu is in the hospital, but it is so vague that it is lost in layers of medical and technical jargon. And that is when Jennifer Connelly's character states that he basically had to be ""born on earth""This intro. although nicely filmed, is never really explained, we are not told who this man is, if he is the same Klaatu that we see in rest of the film, or if he is some random human being whose body was used in a kind of flinching nod to ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers""In this film the ""landing spot"" is Central park in New York City, just another ""change"" that makes no sense, maybe this new Klaatu wanted to go to the UN Building. And of course this is exactly what he wanted to do, just like the original film. just another place where I was wrong in my original review.Eventually, through some pages of technobabble, Klaatu comes out and Gort makes his first appearance. Initially, this Gort seems to be a pretty good update of the original Character. More on that later.One thing that is common to both films is the extreme paranoia of the government and certain people. Actually, this film makes profound statements regarding the Bush administration and it's non-realistic responses to perceived, and sometimes invented threats. If the President Kathy Bates represents is Bush, that explains that president's insistence on violent military reprisals. This would also be true in an updated review where that president would be Drumpf. Because whoever the president was in this film, he was totally unqualified to govern or to respond to Klaatu's LandingThis film early on takes on characteristics of an ecological documentary, like ""An Important Truth"" or last years ""The Eleventh Hour"". But again, the original movie was a very important ecological statement so again, my original assessment was totally wrong.In this mode, the film tries to tell the same story of Klaatu and Gort that was told by Robert Wise so successfully as an anti-McCarthyism film in 1951, but as that film succeeded, this film fails. Unless you watch it a few more times. Not that the film's ecological messages are bad messages, it is just that they are forced into this format and it does not work. Actually it does work, once again I was 100% incorrect. Mainly because where the first film leaves us a measure of Hope, this film leaves us with a measure of NO hope, and a large amount of it. And once again I missed the point completely this film leaves us with a large measure of hope, simply because the earth standing still being a permanent reality at the end of this film, does not make it a no hope situation.The child in this film, Jacob Benson as played by Jaden Smith, is a rotten, spoiled, misbehaving brat who did not get spanked enough - Who shows a level of disrespect to his Stepmother, and where that child from the 1951 film was bright and inquisitive, this child is introverted and is only talented at playing world of warcraft or Halo 3. And as his whining takes up almost 2/3rd of the film, this is very unpleasant. However, that child does get turned around when he realizes that nobody really left him alone. And that his stepmother Jennifer Connelly does in fact love him.The relationships that are built in the 1951 film between Klaatu and all those he encounters are wholly missing, especially the couple of days where Klaatu actually lives and intermixes with ""earthlings""Although the look and shape of Gort is similar to the book and also the 1951 film, the nature of Gort was changed, and the shape he takes toward the second half of the film is different, and not exactly the form expected. Also missing is the encasement of Gort in the clear plastic cube, which was actually the centerpiece of both the Harry Bates story and the first film.If I had not seen the original film or read the Harry Bates short story, I might have enjoyed this a lot more than I did... And although I thought the changes to the story too substantial, I did enjoy parts of this film, so I did not insist on my money back.In the original film, the Klaatu used Gort to make the Earth ""stand still"". In this film, Klaatu also uses Gort to do this, but to a much more severe extent.But to say anymore about that would be a major spoiler.I need to totally rewrite this review but I have entered some corrections into my previous negative reaction to this film. in fact, they even used the music from the original movie at the very end of this movie, if you listen for it carefully it is there. uncredited of course, but Tyler Bates does a great job with this film, The only other film of note he had worked on at the time was of course Watchmen.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
74,MBunge,Be careful what you wish for,4,13 September 2010,"When I reviewed the original The Day the Earth Stood Still, I said that someone ought to remake it because as good as the original is, any picture over half a century old is going to have a dated quality to it. The basic story of that first film, however, deserves to be retold in ways that new audiences can better appreciate. But while almost everything about this remake will be more palatable to modern audiences than the black-and-white classic, they forgot to include the basic story that made the original worth being remade.Both films have the same beginning. An space craft lands on Earth and an alien named Klaatu (Keanu Reeves) emerges, only to get shot just a few steps outside his ship. That brings out a giant robot who starts attacking the surrounding authorities until Klaatu orders him to stop. Klaatu is taken into custody and his wound is healed, then he announces that he has a message for the leaders of the world. He isn't able to give that message and escapes from custody, this time with the assistance of Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly), one of the scientists gathered in response to the approaching spacecraft. As the U.S. military and law enforcement tries to find Klaatu and figure out what to do with his giant robot, Helen and her step-son Jacob (Jaden Smith) discover that when Klaatu says he's here to save the Earth, that's doesn't necessarily mean he's here to save humanity.The fundamental thing to know about this remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still is that at every point where the original film was smart and bold, this movie is dumb and cowardly. You shouldn't be confused because this remake deals with certain elements of the story in more realistic detail. That's just window dressing. If you pay attention, you'll realize that this film only pretends to have a message and a real point of view.Firstly, this movie doesn't specify precisely what the problem is with Mankind. It's supposed to be some sort of environmental message. Klaatu does talk about how humans are killing the planetbut he never says exactly how we're doing that. Is the problem global warming? Overpopulation? The genetic modification of animals and plants? Resource depletion? The original film showed the audience what human thinking and behavior it found problematic. The remake just generically classifies humans as bad. I suppose if you already consider other people a blight on the Earth, that lack of specificity won't bother you. But by not delineating what human action is so terrible that Man needs to be wiped out, there's no teeth in 2008 Klaatu's denunciations of humanity. Because it's so vague, you can't take the condemnation personally, which takes away from any emotional investment you can have in the story.Secondly, this remake never really deals with what sort of changes should be made in the world. Other than a rudimentary ""Be nicer to Mother Earth"" attitude, this story never really offers up an alternative to the way things are. The first film very clearly stated ""If humans stop doing X and start doing Y, we'll deserve to survive"". This film says ""Humans deserve to survive becausewell, because a stepmother and a stepson love each other"". I'm not kidding. It justifies the continued existence of Mankind by the fact that human beings care for one another. That sort of namby pamby, undefined rationale has no emotional impact. It's nice and all that Helen and Jacob are brought together over this crisis but if you're going to question humanity's right to exist, you need to come up with something bigger than that personal drama.As far as the acting goes, Keanu Reeves is quite good. Some might say that playing an alien in human form didn't require much acting from him, but he has an ability to put up this wooden front while letting us see little glimmers of what's going on behind. Jennifer Connelly doesn't do anything exceptional with her role, but she does well in showing us Helen's struggles in relating to her resentful stepson. Jaden Smith has the presence of an actor, but he's not one of those freakish prodigies like Dakota Fanning or Haley Joel Osment. There's nothing wrong with his performance but there's no real depth to it, which you shouldn't really expect from a normal kid his age.The movie doesn't have quite as many special effects as a lot of big budget spectaculars, but it does try and show you something different than the explosion-o-ramas these films normally are. I'm not impressed by any of it, but I'm not impressed by modern effects in general. I know computers can now create virtually anything on screen, and I can't be awed by anything concocted by a bunch of computer nerds between sessions playing World of Warcraft. Now that these effects are nothing more than lines of code, I can't take them seriously.The remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still isn't a bad film. It's just too dumb and too wishy washy for the subject matter of this story. If you've never seen the original and don't plan on seeing it, you might enjoy the remake. But if you ever compare the new version with the classic, I don't see how you can't come away disappointed.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
75,MaxBorg89,"Klaatu Reeves, anyone?",7,13 December 2008,"The main selling point of Scott Derrickson's decision to remake Robert Wise's The Day the Earth Stood Still (a sci-fi masterwork) is that a lot of people have heard about it, but very few have actually seen it. Even the film's most famous line, ""Klaatu barada nikto"" (which is spoken in the remake as well), is more known to genre fans thanks to Sam Raimi's brilliant comic interpretation in Army of Darkness (a movie Derrickson has said to be a big fan of, by the way). The new version doesn't live up to the original, but it does have enough substance to qualify as a popcorn movie of the smarter kind.These being our post-9/11 times, major changes are required: instead of Washington, it is Manhattan that Klaatu's spaceship lands in; the robot Gort is a heck of a lot bigger; and the alien visitor itself is actually, well, alien. It isn't until the creature is hospitalized with a gunshot wound (you know, the US military: shoot first, ask questions later) that the gray skin falls off and a human shape (well, Keanu Reeves) is revealed. This shape has something to say. As usual, the Secretary of Defense (Kathy Bates), standing in for the President, doesn't care about listening, and those who do (a group of scientists, played by Jennifer Connelly and Mad Men's Jon Hamm among others) might not have enough influence to stop Klaatu's Earth-saving ""process"". After all, he doesn't have that high an opinion of the human race: ""If you die, the Earth survives"".Coming after Emmerich's The Day after Tomorrow, Spielberg's War of the Worlds and Shyamalan's more understated The Happening, Derrickson's picture is another bleak portrait of our society, which finds itself, to quote the characters, on the brink of a precipice. Whereas the '51 version was a warning against a potential nuclear war, the update is more concerned with the environment, although, and that's one of the movie's weaknesses, it doesn't go very far in pinpointing its message. Subtlety isn't generally a defect, but too much of it can be. In terms of narrative, one might also wonder why writer David Scarpa put in a clichéd mother/son story-arc which slows down the movie considerably (besides, Jaden Smith is quite annoying in the entire first half of the feature).As for the other aspect that could have been problematic, namely explicit references to Wise's movie, it's actually a strength, as Derrickson make sure that classic scenes (the blackout, for example) get the 21st century treatment they deserve. The new Gort, in particular, is worth the price of the ticket alone, making Transformers look like an Ed Wood movie. Only the classic meeting with Professor Barnhardt fails to deliver, and that's because John Cleese is the weakest link in an otherwise fine cast (even Prison Break's Robert Knepper manages to transcend stereotype). The biggest question, of course, is whether Reeves can pull it off. The answer, which was already present in the trailer, is a confident ""Hell, yes!"": he's no Michael Rennie, that's for sure, but his trademark lack of emotion, which came close to ruining Dracula and Dangerous Liaisons, makes him the perfect choice for the role of an alien. In fact, it's not hard to believe that the producers never thought of anyone else when the project started taking shape.Bottom line: 1951 - an essential genre picture, with a great script, lots of suspense and a chilling central performance; 2008 - an enjoyable revisit, with great visual effects, a relevant but underdeveloped message, and a scarily effective Keanu Reeves.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Well, its been 60 years since Klattu's last visit and we are still bad and will not be changing our ways anytime soon. One longs for the aliens to take us out of our misery. If only they had come in time to take us out of our misery for this film. The kid is terrible. More of Cleese would have been good, and Hamm is wasted. Bates is unintentionally hilarious, and Reeves is OK. Connelly does the best she can with the crap script she is given.

Let's get started.Apart from Keanu Reeves who played an emotionless alien who came as a messenger was effective in his role. Jennifer Connelly played a scientist whose job was everything apart from being a scientist. Jaden Smith was a backstabbing brat who was there to make the life miserable for others. Kathy Bates played 'I am the secretary of defence of the United States and I can do whatever I want' Jon Hamm as NASA scientist and Kyle Chandler was ok.The loopholes. An alien who can sense a sphere from miles away can't sense an incoming helicopters. He can stop everything but can't stop Helen being abducted. In climax when they met with a brutal accident Michael dies in the accident and apart from him no one has a bruise on their body. If the alien has the power to revive the deceased, as he had revived the police man who was there to arrest them why he didn't revives Michael who had helped them a lot.With a boring screenplay, predictable climax and awful acting.

It pains me to say it, but Keeanu Reeves is the most convincing character. He plays a robot-like, monosyllabic alien who has come to Earth to destroy man so that the planet can be saved from environmental destruction. Jennifer Connelly helps him change his mind. The film has nothing good going for it. The dialog is stilted and clichéd to the point of hysterics. Ed Wood would have had fun with it; director Scott Derrickson doesn't. For some dumb, PC reason, Jaden Smith (Will's son) plays the adopted black son of Connelly. He's written as an annoying SOB who should have been smoked by the Gort robot. Gort, by the way, resembles the original Gort; he's just taller. The pacing is at snail speed (almost still) and the special effects look like special effects. The climax writes the textbook on anti-climax and leaves us with a sour taste that Tyler Bates' awful score can't sweeten. John Hamm, from the fantastic ""Mad Men"", is thoroughly wasted.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

82,peterp-450-298716,Dumb and Dumber,4,2 January 2014,"What would you do when you're sitting with your family in the middle of nowhere in the Ardennes in a primitive looking cabin with only a crossword puzzle and a Galaxy tablet that doesn't work anymore because your limit of 150MB is reached ? I was smart enough to bring along my Medi8ter and connected it with the provided LCD-TV. Finally the kids got their overdose of cartoons and were sleeping in their cozy bed so I could browse on the Medi8ter and look for something to watch. Most of it are older movies like ""The day the earth stood still"". I wished time would have stopped so I wouldn't have wasted it.Unfortunately I haven't seen the original film of 1951 and can't compare this remake . On the other hand I'm not so eager to watch such an antique movie with probably non-existing special effects. But when the content of this remake is identical to the original and the remake stinks , then I certainly won't bother to watch the original. So what is wrong with this movie ? The moral message this film wants to preach is well known to us , and I don't like it when a movie tries to hammer that message in my head and wave with a pedantic finger at me. I admit that if we don't change our mentality towards our planet it will bring serious consequences. So if we don't change our eco plan and take care of pollution , use other sources of energy and be more peaceful and tolerant , Earth could become a dreary place to live on . The idea that there are more advanced civilizations out there watching over us and at some point decide to save Earth by destroying mankind, is a brilliant idea for a movie. My conclusion was that these aliens are terribly ridiculous and stupid. The intellectual study they made is thrown overboard because an attractive scientist is crying , along with her ​​stepson , at the grave of her husband . So please do remember this everybody ! Should it ever come to an alien invasion, then we'll all just show an emotionally and compassionate side of ourselves . Success guaranteed! They'll leave in a flash.The U.S. puts billions of dollars in research and equipment to detect life in the universe and try to make contact with them. Then one day an alien arrives at the horizon , not in a flying saucer but in a giant illuminating ball, and instantly the military machine awakes and starts acting , because they have received clear signals of hostile behavior. The first extraterrestrial sets foot/leg/tentacle or whatever supporting material on earth and is shot without mercy before he can say a greeting. At that time I just wanted to stop this movie and save myself from more ridiculous rubbish. And yes, it got worse . The alien Klaatu , is taken to a field hospital and starts to melt in some way after which a human figure is appearing out of those slimes. The logical question asked at Dr. Helen Benson was ""Can you explain this ?"" . Hilarious ! Offcourse she can't explain this since this is her first alien encounter . Dumb, stupid and making me roll my eyes. What follows is a demonstration of human arrogance . Klaatu is taken in for questioning ... What a friendly planet we are ! Bates rules as a Female God and doesn't want to hear about the alleged destruction of the earth and that Dr. Benson has a feeling she can persuade Klaatu to stop this. Now things start to speed up . Dr. Benson and Klaatu escape along with the stepson Jacob . An incredibly irritating and spoiled brat. It was only afterwards that I read it's Will Smiths son. Oh right, the robot that came out of the ball to protect Klaatu is taken by the American army to a secret bunker, where they are trying to destroy it. However, that's not a success as hoped. What remains is a swarm of insects. They start eating in a really destructive way. Everything on their way vanishes. The emotional moment at the grave of Jacob's father ,as mentioned before, is the turning point .Is there anything positive to say about this movie ? Yes, of course . The moment Dr. Benson used a cell phone and got caught by a soldier was a emotional moment in this movie. John Cleese playing an intellectual scientist was excellent and well chosen . Jennifer Connelly has a beautiful appearance . And Reeves plays again with that face without an expression . Personally I don't think he's really much of an actor, but this part as a unworldly, emotionless alien, fits him like a glove. The special effects aren't bad and the moving truck that got eaten by those insects is pretty slick to watch . I 'm just wondering what material the bridge was made of under which they were hiding , since a few moments before that, a complete stadium was eaten.Had the extraterrestrial civilizations studied the inhabitants of the earth a bit longer, they might have come to the conclusion that they should just wait a bit longer. Wait till we destroy ourselves.More reviews at meningvanfilmfreak.blogspot.be",The Day the Earth Stood Still
83,dierregi,Humankind saved by spoiled brat - again,1,6 March 2011,"I saw this movie on TV last night, as I would have never gone to the cinema and wasted my hard-earned money on it. Especially not after having read some of the negative reviews posted here. I cannot but agree with most of them.In a nutshell: Keanu Reeves was probably born to play this part. He is inexpressive and emotionless as the alien role is playing requires. Whether thanks to his acting skill or personality, I do not know, but he does a good job. Apart from him, everything else sucks. Connelly is totally unconvincing playing a scientist. Never saw any scientist looking like a model; honestly, if you are that attractive, you plan a career in show business, not in a lab. The kid – Will Smith's son - is a total brat. Obviously he got the part thanks to daddy. But what has this got to do with actually being able to act? Absolutely nothing.To compound the felony, humankind is supposed to be saved thanks to the emotional connection of the alien with this obnoxious child. If this was a real life situation, I think the alien would speed up destruction after having met this unbearable brat. How is whining and being a pain in the ass supposed to prove that humankind will change for the better? If our salvation depends on a child – especially one like this – we are definitely doomed. And perhaps the aliens have a good point.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
84,Seraphion,Lost the real edge of an alien invasion movie,5,15 July 2014,"The premise of course is another often repeated one of alien invasion. It's good that the alien is portrayed well enough, even though it's using the classic concept of aliens using human body. The destruction is also presented in a new way, which is quite cool. But the whole movie seems like it loses one key element of the sub genre of alien invasion and disaster movies, which is having live action scenes of many people in panic or fighting the alien. The movie puts the panic scenes only so much in the news coverage. The army battle scenes only include all those missiles being launched and tanks shooting things up. The acting is good though. Reeves and Connelly did a good job, even Smith is also quite convincing.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
85,ctomvelu1,Not up to snuff,5,7 May 2011,"Keanu Reeves is suitably creepy as an alien who comes to our planet to save it (which actually involves eradicating all living things to allow the planet to rest and recover). But I wasn't buying it for one minute, fancy FX notwithstanding. And frankly it doesn't hold a candle to the original with Michael Rennie. It's basically a lot of chasing around that eventually goes nowhere in particular. The biggest change for this remake is Gort the robot, who now stands about 50 feet high and looks like some sort of Marvel Comics character. I kind of liked the kid who ends up traveling with the alien. He's feisty and doesn't trust this outer space geek for a minute -- until late in the movie, when he goes all warm and cuddly. I was with him when he wanted the alien shot. This being a Keanu Reeves movie, I suspect it made lots of money. But anyone looking for another MATRIX will be sadly disappointed. And for anyone wondering if this version hews any closer to the original short story, the answer is no. Like the original, it skips the whole point of the story, which is that the robot is the master, the ""human"" alien the servant.

Would have paid extra to see him waste Kathy Bates and Michael Hammbone's characters.The big robot was a formidable opponent for the U.S. Armed forces, but that seemed like a different movie from the one Klaatu was involved with.John Cleese added a classy touch.

87,p-stepien,Not the day Reeves started to act,4,24 November 2009,"This XXI century remake had so much potential to it. For one thing the subject matter has become just so much more urgent with the earth being warmed up by human activities. Plus it actually has a plot that makes a lot of sense and makes alien behaviour very logical. Naturally the theme is a little melodramatic, but handled well it could really strike a cord with the viewers...I guess Keanu Reeves is a perfect choice as Klattu with his wooden acting. Makes him a natural alien and his stiffness, awkwardness actually kinda worked. But still nothing to suggest that this guy can ever return to actually acting. Jennifer Connelly is okay, as the scientist intent on saving the world, but really does not have any film presence whatsoever. The only actor you actually notice on screen is John Cleese as Professor Barnhardt, unfortunately not for the right reasons - it is hard to treat the old bloke as 'the leader of humankind' and I remember laughing uncontrollably.Really a missed opportunity. The special effects are fine, but they really hid the story in the end. Instead of a meaningful finale we get an action movie ending. Not suitable. Plus too many cliché cardboard characters... You can turn a blind eye on that in the original, but movie expectations have changed since then. If you go retro than you still have to adjust the style a bit...Overall watchable, but I haven't seen such a forgettable movie since... aaa... sorry folks... forgot the name of it.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Is this humanity's hour of judgment, or salvation? I really don't know how I found The Day The Earth Stood Still to be bearable enough to finish. It's clunky, often boring, and heavy-handed in a way that good science fiction never is. The worst flaws are the script and dialogue, which are simply terrible. Poor Jennifer Connelly often looks like she can't believe the words that are coming out of her mouth, and the other actors don't have it any better. I like Keanu Reaves, but here he is somehow still too stiff and emotionless for a character that's SUPPOSED to be stiff and emotionless. Dull subplots focusing on annoying characters somehow make an already boring movie even worse.

89,moviewizguy,12.12.08 is the Day the Earth Stood Still,6,13 December 2008,"A representative of an alien race that went through drastic evolution to survive its own climate change, Klaatu, comes to Earth. Is it here to save the humans from an impending attack on the Earth? Is he here to destroy the humans or the Earth? Or is he here for some other bizarre reason?Judging from the trailers, commercials, posters, an other publicity advertisements, one can assume this remake of an original classic is updated with more action sequences, filled with special effects throughout the film. 20th Century Fox do seem to push the movie off as a heavy sci-fi, action flick. That's a bad thing because there aren't many action scenes. There are like three scenes total, and they don't even run that long. This could possibly disappoint some audience members, although I'm not trying to say people are seeing this film for the action. It's like ""I Am Legend."" There's more dialog than action, which many won't expect. No, I haven't seen the original so I cannot compare. However, I can say right now I downright enjoyed the movie from beginning to end because of the fact, and I'm not afraid to admit it, that it's an environmental movie.Does this fact seem to shock you? Were you really surprised that this movie was about global warming and us humans destroying the planet? If you just found out this is another ""environmental movie"" just like 50% of the movies released this year (exaggeration in effect), like ""Wall-E,"" ""The Happening,"" and ""Quantum of Solace,"" and you don't like that it's another ""preachy"" movie that's ""trying to convince us to change for the better good,"" well, don't see it. It's simple as that. I guess I love environmental movies because I love the message these films seem to try to get off. The message in this remake is, in my opinion, pitch-perfect and executed in a way that, I don't know, might convince some people to ""go green."" I might seem to sound like a crazy environmentalist right now but I'm not trying to.Getting away from the message, the film supports itself really well and grasped my attention from the beginning to the end because it's all so very interesting, although it may borrow heavily from other sci-fi films. I just find it different from the norm, as a whole, from other sci-fi films. There's barely any action scenes in here, like I said earlier, that you're surprised the movie is more about the characters with dialog than mindless action itself. Keanu Reeves plays well as the emotion-less alien being, although some might joke it's ""the perfect role for him."" Jennifer Connelly also does a very good job in here. She's a very underrated actress. Everyone else, even Jaden Smith, also give us a good performance.Overall, the movie is not an action film although everything shown may show otherwise. The special effects was very good. I'm not complaining at all that this is another environmental movie. I can see 500 more films of the same message and still not complain. If you sound like a person like me, which I highly doubt anyone would be this crazy about saving the Earth, you should give this movie a chance. If you're, however, the complete opposite and think recent films released these past years were too preachy and dumb, don't watch it.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
90,bob-rutzel-1,Almost a different film from the original,6,17 April 2009,"Klaatu (Reeves), an alien, comes to earth to destroy the human race because the humans are destroying the earth. Too many changes from the 1951 version make this almost a different film. Oh, it's still pretty good but more like a fairly good X-Files story (that should have been back in the day) when X-Files was the series/movie to watch. Let me count the changes: (1) Reeves' spoken lines were cut too short. We wanted to hear more from him. After all Michael Rennie, in the original version, had more to say.(2) Too much attention and lines were given to the kid, Jacob (Smith) – it almost became his story. (3) A white single mother Helen (Connolly) has a black stepchild. Why? What did this add to the new version? (4) Klaatu wasn't shot at the end of the movie like Michael Rennie was and GORT had to bring him to the space ship so he could be healed. GORT was the robot that protected Klaatu's race as long as that race didn't become war like. Klaatu's race built the GORTS for that very purpose. This was not explained in this version. (5) The spheres and their movements became too blurry and made me dizzy because those close-up sphere scenes went on for too long. (6) We never saw the space ship - it was a sphere - blurry as it was.(7) there were some other changes, but I am trying not to be picky. Hey, this is not easy for me (Oh, Bob, you know it is).If you are going to do a remake, keep the main elements intact. Some upgrades are acceptable, but not wholesale changes. The overall theme was kept intact, but the changes from what we knew from the original were over the top, and those changes almost made it another story. In the original version the concern was nuclear wars on earth. In this version, I am not sure what the concern was, but it wasn't nuclear war.Overall, not bad, but go see the original version. You will like and understand it better. In fact, you should make it a point to see the original first. Then, you will know..what I know. The original Version deserves an A.

91,mike48128,The Minute the Earth Stood Still?,7,13 June 2014,"O.K. ""Gort"" the robotic man is still cool, but he spends a lot of time just ""hangin' out"" in this overblown remake. When he finally has enough, the mad robot escape scene is shortened for ""content"" on the FX channel. You don't even see him walking back to the spaceship. Clatu is well-played up to a point, but this time it's more about ecology and pollution than total nuclear destruction. Millions of metallic insects are going to eat everything and everybody, and Shea Stadium is on the menu as well. Yum! So what does this movie offer that's better than the Michael Rennie classic? Well, it's in widescreen color and the special effects are more impressive. Like the original movie, the girl (Jennifer Connelly) gets no action, not as much as a peck on the cheek. Clatu (Keanu Reeves) bring more people back from the dead than a self-respecting ""Jesus"" movie. His miracle ointment works better than ""Icy Hot"" on wounds and abrasions. The ending looks very rushed and more so, as cable was running it at top speed, probably 28 FPS to stick in more commercials. The electricity only ""stands still"" for about a New York minute, and isn't really effective in the last few minutes of the movie. It's almost anti-climatic.

93,OJT,The final warning - remake to fit todays threats,7,10 December 2008,"This remake of the 1951-classic with the same name, had to be immensely different, and so it is. This might obviously disappoint the followers of the great classic based upon the same manuscript. But no one today will understand the frights of war and atomic bombs as they were just after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Todays main threat is the total misuse of Mother Earth. And the threat is the human species. What is then kept the same as in the original? Not so much as this one will ruin watching the original. The main idea is kept - a warning, though it's made more drastically. But the warning is not meant to be the same way as in the 1951-version. Here the destruction is already decided and is starting.Keanu Reeves is believable as an alien, and just as good as the original 57 years ago. The military is just as stupid. The big robot is of course bigger and more powerful and sophisticated. The technology is of course far more advanced. It had to be, when in the 1951-version it is nowadays quite outdated. The boy is more like he would be today. Spoilt, and pre-teenage angry, but still as irritating. The woman is of course not working in an office. So the main structures are all there.It hasn't got the charm of the old version, but it's got the seriousness in tenfolds. While the 1951-version has inspired lots of after-coming sci-fi films and later classics, we find threads of others in this new one. The touch of films like Contact, A.I., but still this is quite different from what you have ever seen.The use of nano technology as the destructive force is well made, though not explained in any way, while eating away on structures of all kind. It is just as modern as it has to be to be a modern sci-fi movie of today.What is beautiful in this is the afterthought provoking feeling that man can change, we just have to be on the brink of destruction to understand. The last part has colors of adventure, and is the most beautiful part.I very much missed the music from the trailer, the music in the film seems of no importance. Sentimental music would have enhanced the feeling, and I'd like it darker. But I guess this is the way it has to be coming from Hollywood. This film will be cherished by some and hated by others. It's still a great idea, which they could have made much more out of. I think it will inspire new film with the use of nano technology. Will we soon see the filming of the late Michael Chrichtons book Prey?Well this film won't be enough to scare us ruining the planet. The film as a medium has the power to do this, but no one dares go all the way! I'll be waiting for someone to dare! So far The inconvenient truth is the best effort in scaring us to understand that this planet is not unbreakable.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Instead of a cool disintegrator ray, we get some flying oragami cockroaches. And some dark clouds, too.

95,dunmore_ego,The Day Keanu's Face Muscles Stood Still.,5,20 December 2008,"Keanu Reeves elevates his One Facial Expression Method to new levels of expressionlessness in this wooden remake of the 1951 film.Though excellent concepts are broached in both THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL films (1951 and 2008 versions), both films are ruined by their gutless denouements, failing to follow through on their stances of the human race not being worthy of continuing its existence.In 1951, Michael Rennie, as alien Klaatu, landed in Washington in a glowing cardboard flying saucer; in 2008, a gaunt Keanu Reeves is Klaatu, landing in Manhattan in a spectacularly-visualized translucent sphere. Upon exiting his vehicle, he is shot, which precipitates the appearance of his bodyguard, Gort.In 1951, mechanical man Gort was a foam rubber, eight-foot automaton who dumpled from side to side like a mummy - nothing you couldn't outrun or outlaugh; in 2008, Gort thunders out as a 50-foot war machine, black metallic steel-flecked texture, Iron-Man-meets-the-Balrog, super conductive, super destructive.Yes, the ""effects"" of 2008 elevate this movie above the original, as does the updating of social mores, better acting and ""realism"" - but let's not talk of ""realism"" for either movie, as the English-speaking, oxygen-breathing, bipedal, humanoid, physics-bending Klaatu contravenes any discussion - suffice to say, 2008's remake is not as cringe-inducing or naive as the 1951 original. The intriguing first act, fraught with scientific exposition, is where this EARTH STOOD STILL shines.It keeps shining through the somber exchange between Klaatu and presidential spokeswoman, Regina Jackson (Kathy Bates), understating the superiority of unknown worlds beautifully, when Klaatu says, 'Your' planet? Jackson: Yes, this is our planet. Klaatu: No. It is not.Oh, snap! Then screenwriter David Scarpa pulls away from Edmund H. North's original screenplay, making Klaatu an environmentalist, giving new meaning to Little Green Men: ""This planet has reached a Tipping Point"" (trademark, Al Gore); ""This planet can't be allowed to perish"" (trademark, Al Gore); ""If the Earth dies, you die. If you die, the Earth survives"" (trademark, Lex Luthor).And everything shiny goes dull and everything dumb gets dumber.Tasty spinner scientist, Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly), befriends Klaatu and aids his quest to communicate with someone intelligent - that would rule out everyone from the military all the way down to the president.That's where Monty Python steps in - John Cleese (in an excellent cameo as The Smartest Man in the World - sounds like a Python sketch, doesn't it?), who argues against humanity's destruction by imploring Klaatu, ""At the precipice, we change."" (Both John Cleese and Gort have way too little screen time.) Cleese's importuning counts for nothing, as Klaatu has an insider, James Hong, an alien sent to Earth 70 years ago who has lived among us, studying our proclivities, who reports that - (we can smell it coming a mile away! The insufferable ""Humans are warlike - BUT NOBLE"" moment) - who reports to Klaatu that HUMANS ARE WARLIKE - BUT NOBLE.'Scuse me while I kiss the sky... and vomit. Just once I'd like to see humans pay for their pompous arrogance! In 1951, Michael Rennie very clearly said: ""it is no concern of ours how you run your own planet, but if you threaten to extend your violence, this Earth of yours will be reduced to a burned out cinder."" Which means: only when Earth extends its belligerence off-planet will those ""intergalactic police"" step in and bring peace by... er, force.In 2008, Klaatu's intergalactic police are simply whining greenies, even though the ORIGINAL message could have been used more potently in this age of human extra-terrestrial exploration (with our spaceships, probes, and terraforming equipment being sent to the planets, stars and other galaxies).Gort (whose ker-ray-zee 1950s-monster-name was turned into an acronym for this ""scientific"" remake: Genetically Organized Robot Technology) disintegrates into trillions of little components (CGI insectoids) who ravage the landscape, decimating cities like locusts. How can Klaatu-Keanu say the human race is ""killing the planet,"" with a straight face when Gort's insectoids are doing the same thing? (Well, I guess when you don't have facial acting muscles, you can say anything with a straight face...) And why are they eating buildings anyway? Giants Stadium is not ""the human species"" - but it makes for a spanky movie trailer.To cap off the gutlessness and stupidity, Kleaanu has his ""humans are a noble species"" epiphany - as we knew he would - and sends out an electromagnetic pulse (we presume) that destroys the insectoids and brings on ""the day the earth stood still"" as it cuts all electricity, stops all traffic, boats, factories, etc. And lets the humans live. As he rises quietly into the cosmos to go green up another bunch of dweebs.In 50 years, they will laugh at 2008's THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, as we laugh at the 1951 version - they will laugh at our '08 social mores, laugh at our computers, at ""tipping pont"" references, at the CGI insectoids, at the mixed messages...As for the boy of wood who somehow made a career out of ""acting"" - Keanu - one person will not be laughing at him.

This pretty much has the same plot, but it's done in a very different way. I didn't like that the flying saucer was a gigantic glowing ball, but it was cool. I did like that Gort was 100 feet tall in this one and looked more scary. Keanu Reeves did a pretty good job as Klaatu, who warns that if the people of Earth don't stop the violence, that the humans of Earth will be destroyed. I wasn't a big fan of Helen Benson' step-son being black and hated Klaatu, because in the original, her son was white and became friends with him. (I'm not racist.)

Even though I didn't expect much when I heard that they were going to do a remake I wasn't expecting the film to be this bad. The script has NO logic whatsoever. It ambulates here and there, with no idea what it's supposed to be. From the get go, the film never got a chance: when the government learns about a mysterious object heading towards earth, with a direct trajectory for New York city, they assemble a bunch of scientists and fly them to the maybe soon to be destroyed city. What kind of logic is that? If you're going to assemble the brightest scientists to help with how to cope with a possible impending disaster, why fly them directly in the object's path? Because they didn't know how the object was going to react once it entered the earth's atmosphere, it would have made more sense for them to wait after the object landed or crashed and then go to New York city once the city was safe or its impact didn't cause any massive destruction. This happens at the beginning and it's downhill from then on. The script is filled with an endless series of illogical plot points that's are an insult to anyone with any intelligence.But it's not only the script that's bad. The acting, dialogue, special effects and action are all awful. Specific scenes like Keanu killing and reviving the police officer; Keanu and John Cleese talking about humanity; the nano insects (why insect-shaped?) thingies coming from Gort; the decision to have the military come up with the name GORT, which is an acronym for ""Genetically Organized Robotic Technology"" (I kid you not) were all jaw on the floor painfully bad to witness.

99,Sirus_the_Virus,We stood still.,5,15 November 2009,"Keanu Reeves, Jennifer Connoly, and others star in The day the earth stood still, the remake of the 50's classic. Of course, most of the time, remakes aren't as good as the original. Dpn't attack me but I have never seen the original. My girlfriend has and said it was awesome. I saw the remake a couple of weeks ago because I was in the mood for some crap. This movie wasn't crap, but it wasn't really that far off.Jennifer Connoly stars as a scientist. Her and her colleagues predict that a huge meteor will strike New York within 75 minutes. A meteor of some sort does arrive, but it doesn't kill anyone. An alien named Klautu(Played by Keanu Reeves) and a robot have apparently arrived in it.While interrogating this alien, they find out that him and this large cyborg have come to earth, to, of course, destroy it. Because they believe that earth isn't exactly a good place and they make tons of mistakes. Thank you, we should've realized that when we elected Obama. So him and this scientist and her step son realize that if the human die than the planet(earth) will survive.I'll give it to them for visuals. There are a lot of visuals and the films cast, also including Kathy Bates and John Hamm and even John Cleese as a scientist. That I can see. But this film is a flawed film. The acting in it is kind of bad. Every time I see a Keanu Reeves film I think he is forcing his performance because he wants to be serious. He's not serious. He's the guy from Bill and Ted.As much as he tries to cover it up, he is.This movie isn't as big of a disaster as I thought it would be. But once it was over, I thought that there really wasn't a point to it. Keanu could've put an end to all of this. If you're expecting to hate it like I was, then you'll be disappointed like I was.

This remake tries to update the old atomic-era paranoia changing it with an environmentalist and new eco-message. It's about an alarming and cautionary tale, full of menace and warnings; it coddles the audience with the happy ending (assuring all these bad things will eventually work themselves out) and sometimes seems to be filled with hidden publicity.

Keanu Reeves seemed like a likely cast for Klaatu and I knew in the back of my mind that Gort was going to be CGI'ed to death although I was hoping...not. John Cleese was also a good pick for the professor, his quiet understatement of the role was good. But what seemed to be missing was a good updated re-telling of the tale.It wasn't chilling as the classic - I would guess because there was nothing for us to be chilled about. I mean, back then with the cold war, etc., etc...your mind could be taken places where you think Aliens and Earth would fear to tread. The worst thing was, I didn't care about anyone. I love Jennifer Connelley every time I see her act, but here, there was nothing for her to really knaw on. And then there was her step child who was annoying in the worst kind of way, not even in a dramatic kind of way (and all throughout the film I was too preoccupied with wanting to give him a haircut so that should tell you something as well.) And John Hamm...? Wasted in this film. Kathy Bates? There is so much more they could have done with her to make her more than one dimensional as the Secretary of Defense ...but didn't.There were a lot of actors to see, who weren't doin' anything ... much. But Keannu and Gort. Wow. So much more that could have been done. I really like the part of how and when they gathered all the scientists, but after than, it got patchy and I never saw hide nor hare of them again. Too bad. Looked like that part was going somewhere.Anyway, I gave it a 5 because it was so-so.

102,TheUnknown837-1,"This ""Day the Earth Stood Still"" is a pointless remake and it has some eye-rolling moments and a terrible conclusion, but if perceived as a B-movie, it might be enjoyable",7,27 November 2009,"Some classics are so revolutionary and impeccable as they are that there really is no need to try to remake them. However, the 1951 masterpiece ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" was not one of them. That picture, though very strong, could be effectively made again in the 21st century, even though a remake is really unnecessary. The heavily panned 2008 remake somewhat deserves the negative reputation it has. Yes, it is a pointless remake that emphasizes too much on the visual effects and not enough on the story. No, it's not even half the movie the original was. Yes, the original is ten times better and always will be. No, this is not a great remake.Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie on the level that I saw it. I did not sit down to watch a revolutionary remake. Perhaps the negative publicity had caused me to lower my standards enough. I saw the remake of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" really as a hokey B-movie retread of a classic story and on that level, I had fun with it.Even though I did marginally like the movie, most of my review will focus on criticisms because again, I only enjoyed the movie as a camp-fest and not the visionary gem the original was.A heavy point of criticism focuses on the one-note performance of Keanu Reeves. Here he portrays the same character that Michael Rennie made famous in the 1951 original. Reeves maintains a slow, grim speed and glower throughout the entirety of the picture. Frankly, he reminded me more of a Terminator than an alien. And the charm that made the Rennie's Klaatu so memorable is gone. But this is really the fault of the screenwriters who gave Reeves very little to work on. Overall, I thought Keanu Reeves did as good a job as he as actor could have done with the material he was handed.I like Jennifer Connelly and her performance is noble enough, but she doesn't have much to do. And Jaden Smith is also good in the movie, but the character he has to play is a little ostentatiously bratty and noisy and thus, I really didn't come to care about his fate.These are the three main characters and everybody else has no personality whatsoever. They just come and go here and there. Now as for the special effects? They are also part of the reason why I saw this Day the Earth Stood Still as a B-movie. The special effects are not very impressive, particularly when referring to the robot giant Gort, who was impressive in the original, but just phony here.Ultimately, the reason why this remake does not work in the same way that the original did is because it has it down in its mind that just because you can update the special effects that you will strike with the same results and that's balderdash. Take Peter Jackson's remake of ""King Kong."" Jackson most certainly updated the effects, but his remake worked because he also updated the story.In the end, I liked the movie, but only when I perceived it as a campy B-movie instead of the A-class remake that a lot of fans of the original were hoping for. Had I seen it without reading the reviews before, I don't think I would have enjoyed it. But lowering my standards for a hundred minutes and just taking what came, despite a few eye-rolling moments, some banal product placement, and a horrendously bad ending, I did enjoy this remake.Nevertheless, my advice is to still with the original. That's a better film for any time of the day. This is just a funny way to pass time when there's little else to do. It could have been much, much better, but it might have been a lot worse as well.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
103,jaredmobarak,Only on the precipice do we evolve  The Day the Earth Stood Still,4,31 December 2008,". The new The Day the Earth Stood Still attempts to distance itself from the original, only keeping the character names and a very general backbone to the plotits script is based on the first film's screenplay. While that could have freed the movie into becoming something new and different, the Hollywood machine decided to throw creativity out the window, making a bland, flashy popcorn flick, desperately trying to be pithy, yet only reinforcing how much better the original really is.You know things have gone wrong when writer David Scarpa decides to be clever, making the giant robot get named by the government as an asinine acronym. Why can't Klaatu just say that its name is Gort? Why does the military have to call it G.O.R.T.? It's unnecessary and shows the sort of tongue-in-cheek callbacks that for some reason seem more important then telling an intriguing story. The most recognizable part of the first film is even completely cut out. How can you watch The Day the Earth Stood Still without the utterance of ""Klaatu barada nikto""? It's just plain sacrilege. Rather than a tale about humanity's destruction of themselves and their world, we get a thinly veiled commentary on how America is the cowboy of Earth, calling itself leader and making decisions without the input of other world powers. This is no longer a cautionary story about people's negativity and proclivity for violence; it has warped into the USA's hubris and bullheadedness on topics such as survival. The country has aligned itself with a destroy all enemies before they can destroy us agenda, not realizing that by using force unprovoked will only therefore provoke the invading party, who will always be more powerful than us.As for the story itself, don't expect a shot for shot remake here, there is a lot different. For one, Jennifer Connelly plays Helen Benson as an astrobiologist, integral to the government's interaction with the aliens as opposed to some random woman at the lodging house Klaatu visits in the original. But again, that all makes sense being 2008 now, in a post-9/11 world. Gone are the days an alien can land in Central Park and be met by local police. Instead we need to have the government tracking the visitor during its descent, preparing for an attack, only allowing certain scientists access at the eleventh hour, the public only when impact occurs. So, Helen meets Klaatu while he is being incarcerated, leaving an indelible impression as she becomes the reason he is allowed to escape the facility and attempt to meet with the universe's undercover agent Mr. Wu, (played by the always wonderful James Hong). We then experience a collecting of lifeforms, a Noah's Ark effect as Kathy Bates' Secretary of State so obviously points out, as Klaatu prepares to let humanity die in order to save the planeta very rare commodity being that it can sustain complex life.On a purely special effects basis, there are definite reasons to watch this film. G.O.R.T.'s body's disintegration into microscopic, multiplying, cutting insects is quite cool to behold. The rapid cracking of glass or dissolving of human tissue is well-orchestrated, not to mention the absolute destruction of Giants Stadium. Talk about a multi-million dollar effect that lasts about five secondsworth every penny. I even enjoyed the sphere work of thunderclouds and fluid smoke/fog. And Klaatu's healing power was a bit more advanced then needing Gort from the original to animate him again. Now, as long as he has a power source, the alien can jumpstart the vitals of a recently killed policeman, dead as a result of his now savior.There are also a lot of good actors involved, all of who seem wasted. Besides Connelly, only Keanu Reeves' Klaatu is given ample screen time. It's a role that he is built fordevoid of emotionanyone who isn't a fan for that reason should enjoy his wooden delivery finally working perfectly. I joke, though, as I'm a fan of his, it's just an easy comment to make, and I'm sure many do. As for the rest of the cast, I really liked John Cleese as a subdued Nobel Prize winning scientist. Without bombast, yet still with some humor, he appears to single-handedly plant the bug into Klaatu's head that Earth may be worth saving. And being that this very important role in the first film only gets about five minutes of facetime here, that's quite the feat. As for Jaden Smith, who shined in Pursuit of Happiness, I can't say the same. Maybe it is the script's fault for being so ham-fisted, but I just got annoyed with him. Always complaining, always rebelling, always being selfish, the part was written to progress the plot and it unfortunately shows.That is the main problem here; it is all so obvious and contrived that you lose all sense of wonder and intrigue. You know that the boy's father's death as a military man will come into play, you know that him calling his stepmother Helen so emphatically will have a reversal before the film's end, and you know that somehow everything will be OK. My biggest gripe, however, is with the ending. Stop reading now if you don't want anything spoiled, although you should know how it ends by now anyways, but  Klaatu just leaves? He is about to destroy humanity and because a son finally calls his mother ""mom"", even though right after that the US government attempts to blow him up, he decides to give them a second chance? Without even meeting world leaders to explain what they need to do? I guess extra-terrestrials give us way too much credit, because if that was I, there's no way we'd survive the night. If anything, the US will just start saying they scared him off and were victorious against the intruders. I don't see an entire nation acquiring enough humility to save itself in that short of time.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

The horrible dialogue? The ludicrously overdone special effects? The nonsensical ending? Any direction you choose to go in gives you plenty to criticize. What a mess this is.The story is the most important thing in any film so best to start there. The original film was about the dangers of war. This film is about what? The need to recycle our plastics? Lame. And there are plenty of other aspects of the story which make no sense whatsoever if you actually think about it. Of course thinking about this film's story really is a waste of precious brain cells. The story fails, the movie fails. Pretty simple really. But just in case the lousy story isn't enough this film piles on layer upon layer of failure. The best thing that can be said about the acting is that at least Keanu Reeves knows how to play wooden and emotionless. His performance as Klaatu actually kind of works. But Jennifer Connelly? Keep this up and the Academy's going to ask for their Oscar back. Kathy Bates as the Secretary of Defense? No. Just no. And Jaden Smith, step right up and take your place at the head of the list of most annoying child performances ever. Must be nice to have a father who can get you jobs like this even if you have no discernible acting ability.Perhaps the only thing more annoying than watching the actors speak the film's cringe-inducing dialogue is watching the overblown special effects. The original film had no budget for effects and had to focus on story. This film had a massive budget and the end result is predictable. It's a special effects orgy with no story to ground the film. All the effects are over the top but above all else what in the world have they done with poor Gort? Give me back my 1951 guy in a foam rubber suit please. What they've done with Gort is truly laughable. Finally, and not a moment too soon if you actually have to sit through this drivel, we come to the film's ending. If you wanted to be polite you could say that the film's conclusion is not particularly well thought out. If you were unconcerned with being polite you could say it's the perfectly stupid finish to a perfectly stupid movie.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
105,MrGKB,"Reminded me a lot of ""I Am Legend""...",6,16 December 2008,"...and not just because Jaden ""my parents are actors!"" Smith is the brother of the kid in that one. Scott ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" Derrickson's update of the 50s classic sci-fi parable ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" starts off with great promise, as did ""I Am Legend,"" but begins to weaken in its second act, and falls apart in the third under the weight of its own hubris and less-than-stellar storytelling.Don't let the (sometimes quite eloquent) carpers and minnies on this site fool you, the fx work is pretty impressive, Keanu ""Dude!"" Reeves is fine as the emotionless Klaatu, Jennifer ""Labyrinth"" Connelly fares well as the moral stand-in for humanity while managing to not look like she's just taking a hefty paycheck, and even the Smith kid, insufferable as his character is, manages to evince a few chops. I can't say the same for Kathy ""...Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean"" Bates, who seems strangely uncomfortable in her role as representative of human pigheadedness and conformity, though I did enjoy John ""Monty who?"" Cleese's brief moments as the standard bearer for intelligence and civility. Still, what do you expect? This is, after all, a classic BSM (Big Stupid Movie).As is usually the case, the film's major fault is a script which, though structured in approved yeoman's fashion, fails to captivate the way its predecessor did (and still does) more than half a century ago. The focus of the alien-human confrontation is shifted from post-WWII nuclear paranoia to post-9/11 green awareness Armageddon, but it's simply not as compelling, for various reasons. Screenwriter David ""The Last Castle"" Scarpa crafts a few nice cinematic scenes, gaining in visual appeal what is otherwise lost in various ""oh, c'mons!"" and other lapses in storytelling, not the least of which is the premise. Since when have humans ever threatened to irrevocably render this planet inhospitable to life? And as rare as that life may or may not be throughout the galaxy and the rest of our tiny sector of a nearly incomprehensible expanse of universe, it just seems odd that a star-faring civilization of remarkable prowess, apparently unhindered by emotional conflict, and dedicated to the preservation of life-bearing planets and presumably the populations upon them, would find it necessary to exterminate an offending indigenous dominant species without significant warning of any type, and without providing said errant race the opportunity to repent and redeem their sinful ways (despite the strawman assertion to the contrary contained within the film). The original film had the same sort of problem: how could a nuclear-armed humanity pose any threat to star-faring civilizations that are many, many light years (or even a mere quarter-billion miles!) distant? Both scenarios are utterly illogical and absurd.But, hey! No one whined too hard about ""Independence Day,"" which suffered the same type of conceptual flaw; to wit, why would a space-faring race risk the loss of incredibly valuable hardware to exterminate humanity up close when all it had to do was heave a few large rocks at the planet, wait a bit, and then come down to clean up the mess? Do Hollywood writers actually *think* about their scripts any more? At all? It beggars the imagination! Upshot: ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (or kinda still, maybe just shuffling its feet a mite) is a relatively unremarkable failure, not at all unexpected coming from the glitz machine. Selective viewers can easily dispense with a theatrical viewing and wait for home video. The rest of you are advised to seek out matinées and/or second-run viewings.Edit: Just caught this one again via DVD and stand by everything I've said. Additionally, I was bemused that the marketing geeks decided to add a copy of the original film to the DVD release. Wow, that's like begging to be pilloried, no matter the flaws of the original! Oh, well, give it another 50 years and maybe they'll do a *quality* remake.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
106,vip_ebriega,New 'Day' boasts a nice look but a weaker script.,5,17 January 2010,"My Take: Although slick in its surface, this is a well-made but shallow remake that delivers visually, but fails to live up to its potential.Remakes are usually a gamble. Visually, they'll at least look good. But in place of its great visuals, look and feel, the writing usually pales in comparison. Such is the case for Scott Derrickson's visually-impressive but hollow remake. The original was way ahead of its time back in '51, but probably dates way back today. But despite the good intentions (Derrickson allegedly was a fan of the original), this remake can't help but feel a little flat. So much could have contributed to make it THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL - Another sci-fi classic. Instead it's just THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL - a sci-fi remake that's worth renting on DVD if you have any spare money in your wallet.Still, even if this isn't exactly a great remake of a great original, there are a few new flourishes in this '08 re-do, and I'm ready to give credit where credit is due. I do admit that some of its CGI wizardly is pretty cool, a fitting refurbishing yet itself faithful to the distinct look of the original. A fine cast is there to lend a helping hand. It's sort of a wise move to marry Keanu Reeves with the role of Klaatu. In spite of being completely wooden, Reeves does blend in to the role of the no-nonsense, poker-faced alien. It kinda reminds me of TERMINATOR 2 where Ahnuld, playing the emotionless cyborg, earns the trust of Sarah Conner and her son and follows him throughout the journey. And kinda like T2, there is also rather annoying little kid. As played by Jaden Smith, who shined with his dad Will in PURSUIT OF Happiness, his role is a well-played version of an annoying little brat; he's convincingly annoying which is probably what the role calls for. Meanwhile, Jennifer Connelly doesn't stand a chance as a heroine of the human race or a scientist who can possibly stop global-wide catastrophe; she's just there looking fine... and running a lot.TDTESS is not a bad movie, but as a remake to a quality sci-fi classic, it pales in comparison. The original may have had not enough visuals to satisfy its ambitious scale, but it's intriguing ideas and memorable set pieces do give it justice and make us forget just how dated the visuals are, as the imagination behind it matters more. The remake does otherwise; it has all the effects in the world to make another classic out of the thing. But inspiration goes a long way, and this is what the remake lacks. The ideas and anti-war messages behind the original aren't dumbed down here, but neither are they further ventured as any quality remake should (Like the scene where the President orders to ""open fire"" on the alien ""spheres"", is a fairly obvious jab at irresponsible politics). The CGI 'Gort' is bound to bring nostalgia to long-time fans, and the cast is fine with John Cleese in a straight-faced role of a professor and Kathy Bates as the Defense Secretary, however I would do well without little Smith's grating performance. The way he says ""He's an alien! Don't trust him! Kill Him!"" sounds like fingernails on a chalkboard. THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is not a bad remake, but something's afoot if it's the slick remake to a 50's B&W movie that pales in comparison. Rating: **1/2 out of 5.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

109,jon.h.ochiai,"No Surprises in ""The Day the Earth Stood Still""",7,25 December 2008,"Keanu Reeves has the distinct gift for playing inhuman characters, hinting at an underlying humanity. In that sense Reeves is perfectly cast as alien Klaatu who comes to Earth delivering an ominous warning in Director Scott Derrickson's ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", an updated remake of the 1951 sci-fi classic. Keanu Reeves is really very good reprising the role made famous by Michael Rennie. His placid visage and calm make Klaatu amazingly sympathetic and compelling. Never having seen the entire 1951 classic, I understand that ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" has been updated from the Cold War cautionary tale to the green environmental warning of the world's demise. In one sense Klaatu has been envisioned as an alien Al Gore. Scientist Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) pleads, ""We can change!"" Klaatu cryptically concedes, ""The decision has already been made."" Reeves and Connelly are very good here, and the CGI effects are occasionally stunning. However, the Third Act misses an emotional catharsis. David Scarpa's screenplay adapted from Edmund H. North's original screenplay does well in revising the Green theme, and fleshing out Dr. Benson (Connelly) as a single mom raising her stepson Jacob (Jaden SmithWill's son). Derrickson's direction is very linear, and Scarpa's story lacks provocative twists. ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is solid movie making, but nothing about it is edgy or ambitious.As the movie opens, renowned astrobiologist Helen Benson is summoned to a secret government facility as a matter of grave national security. Her colleague Michael Granier (Jon Hamm) advises, ""Don't be afraid."" In this National State of Alert, Secretary of Defense Regina Jackson (pensive Kathy Bates) is in charge. Klaatu (Reeves) is being interrogated regarding a possible threat against Earth. Klaatu plainly says, ""You should really let me go."" Obeying her own conscience Helen saves Klaatu from perceived harm. Klaatu is also accompanied by giant robot protector. Outwardly, they seem a viable threat to all of humanity.Helen is strangely drawn to Klaatu, and senses his evolving humanity. Klaatu has inhabited a human body from DNA strand premeditatedly taken years before. Seems the longer he remains in his human body, the more human he becomes. There is a humorous scene as Klaatu as corrects Nobel Laureate Prof. Barnhardt's (breezy John Cleese) mathematical treatise. Although mankind has irresponsibly squandered Earth's future, Helen must convince Klaatu that at heart mankind is good and can genuinely transform. Klaatu reminds Helen, ""If the Earth dies, you die. If you die, the Earth survives."" The paradox is that Klaatu is the advanced being of great intellect and possesses amazing life giving powers; however, his purpose is to annihilate all of mankind. Here Director Derrickson and writer Scarpa fail to leverage a narrative opportunity on the nature of man, and the possibility of humanity. Despite Reeves and Connelly's efforts, the conclusion of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is disappointing, and way too safe. Nothing new is revealed. No surprises. Consequently, there may have been no need for ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"".",The Day the Earth Stood Still

112,joebloggscity,Sci-fi remake that just preaches and little entertains,4,14 December 2008,"Keanu Reeves, to his detractors, is quite a one-dimensional actor and would best fit the role of a robot. Cruel point, but in keeping with that idea, he seems to then be well placed as an alien who has come to earth in a human body to warn of impending doom due to mankind's folies.The film is a re-make of a sci-fi classic, and many fans will not take too kindly to the changes to this new version (or simply to the reasoning that it has been remade). Regardless, you don't have to go as far as that to dislike this film. The story is very preachy and never holds your attention for long, where really we already know the points being made, and this film won't be making the impact to generate discussion as maybe the scriptwriters had hoped (there have been better vehicles for that).Acting wise, there is little for anyone to be stretched. Jennifer Connelly, as the lone mother and scientist, is the main central ""human"" character and does a fair job with her part. The special effects are fine but its not enough to make you want to watch this more than any other special effects spectacular.To be honest, there is little more to be said about this film.

113,ajs-10,"Good special effects, but fails to hit the mark...",6,31 March 2010,"Based on the original 1951 classic Sci-Fi movie of the same name, this film tries to update the story and, unfortunately, falls short of the mark IMHO. It's not all bad though; there are some interesting differences in the plot that give it a bit more edge than the original. The setting is New York, the present day Dr Helen Benson, an astrobiologist at Princeton University, is taken by the military, leaving her stepson, Jacob, behind. She is taken, with other scientists, to a base where they are told of an object in space headed towards the Earth and due to hit Manhattan very soon. Waiting in helicopters (not a good idea IMHO), they brace for the impact. It never arrives; instead a glowing sphere gently lands in Central Park. The scientists and the military arrive quickly and, when a humanoid form starts to emerge from the sphere, one of the soldiers shoots and injures him. A giant robot-like creature emerges and begins to harm the soldiers, but is stopped by the humanoid. They take the humanoid to a nearby facility which appears to be a school. Here they remove the bullet and discover that the alien has taken human form and is growing rapidly. Dr Benson seems to have a rapport with him. While recovering he is interviewed by Regina Jackson, the United States Secretary of Defence. He tells them his name is Klaatu and that he is a representative of a group of alien races sent to talk to the world leaders. The Secretary wants to keep Klaatu secret and orders Dr Benson to sedate him so he can be moved to a more secure facility. Dr Benson disobeys and helps Klaatu escape. Meeting up outside and on the run, with young Jacob in tow, Dr Benson eventually finds out why Klaatu has arrived on Earth and is shocked to hear that he is there to destroy mankind in order to save the planet. I'll leave my little synopsis there on that bombshell.First of all, I must say the special effects are pretty spectacular, there is gratuitous use of CGI and it's all very well done. Decent performances from most of the main cast, honourable mentions go to Keanu Reeves as Klaatu, Jennifer Connelly as Helen Benson, John Cleese as Professor Barnhardt and Jon Hamm as Michael Granier. I don't usually point out performances that fell short of the mark, but I feel that both Kathy Bates as Regina Jackson and Jaden Smith as Jacob Benson were totally miscast.In theory this should have been a really great film, the story was really strong but I felt the execution left a lot to be desired. It seemed that everything was far too rushed; you never got the time to engage with any of the characters. So, over all, some great CGI and a great story that was spoilt by being far too hurried. Could have been much better and as such is not very highly recommended.My score: 5.8/10",The Day the Earth Stood Still
114,EijnarAmadeus,"It looks good, and at certain times it even feels good...but nevertheless so boring.",3,18 December 2008,"The Day the Earth Stood Still deserves praise for not being a typical catastrophe/doomsday/extra terrestrial movie, though this ain't something you'll notice right from the start; because the movie opens up feeling like a mix between Armageddon/Deep Impact and all alien-invasion movies for the last few decades. But as the movie starts running I noticed that they didn't use huge explosions, terrifying creatures or creepy set-pieces, instead they try developing Keanu Reeves' character into a frightening thing of terror and the unknown, and Jennifer Connelly (which is an actress I've always adored) has got this step-mum family-drama with her son going on. And basically, it's those two that the movie focuses on, it's very little to say about the supporting cast.The film stumbles early, the original elements of developing suspense through characters, unease and regrets-of-decisions-done are simply not good enough when the film just keeps promising and promising for something big, something exciting to come, and keeps letting me down. What's up with that huge light-ball anyway? And why did they have to set it in New York, AGAIN? And has Keanu Reeves been sleeping in a fridge since the Matrix, returning here as carefree as possible to imagine? It's a remake and it adds new stuff to the older, aged material as making the whole deal into a moral issue of us humans treating the Earth badly, and therefor not deserving to live here, and blah-blah. It could have become a partly Gothic, partly frightening and fascinating take at the worn genre of the planet being under attacked by something so much more powerful than us - instead it becomes boring, slightly mindless and loosing momentum. Actually, if you look into it this is more like a family-drama between a already dead-father, a step-mum not understanding her son and vica verca, and Keanu Reeves psychologically helping them (Sort of like Dr. Phil) to understand each other, that there is that ""other side"" of human beings.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
115,DonFishies,"Boring, inconsistent, and ultimately forgettable",3,25 April 2009,"An alien spacecraft lands in Central Park, and an alien emerges. After being wounded in an attack by the U.S. military, the human-like Klaatu (Keanu Reeves) appears when being nursed back to health and hints at the potential destruction of Earth. He manages to escape government officers, and ends up in the care of scientist Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly). Along with her adopted son Jacob (Jaden Smith), the group attempts to try and stop the impending destruction, while the government chases after them.Buried very deep into the core of The Day the Earth Stood Still is some semblance of a great movie. But its outer shell is anything but.The plot may sound interesting, but after Klaatu makes it clear what his purpose is, the movie becomes a downgraded half-assed chase movie that is more boring than it is thrilling. And by the time the ending comes around, the film and everything about it is utterly forgettable. Humanity appears to be at stake, but none of the characters seem to really care about their survival. It just seems so standard to them, so tactic. Characters are done away with like they are nothing (whether by dying or just not appearing again), and other characters appear with not even the slightest hint of motivation. How are we supposed to leach on to anyone when no one is even remotely likable? The closest we get to a three-dimensional character is Reeves' Klaatu, and he speaks in such riddles and convoluted language that he may as well not be speaking English.Do not get me wrong: The Day the Earth Stood Still is loaded with a goldmine of ideas. But they are all treated as mere inconveniences to the bigger ""plot"" the film struggles with. The filmmakers seem to have very little idea of what they want to do with the picture. It seems to want to send a message, but it does not know how to. It jumps from idea to idea (and even though to thought), hoping to grip onto something that sticks. But nothing does. It is merely written over, waiting for the next idea to spark and be done away with. Even the special effect showpieces are carelessly done. Sure, there are some great effects, but ultimately, there is nothing too spectacular on display here.It is not clear where the fault for this silly and ultimately unneeded film lies. Do we blame screenwriter David Scarpa for not knowing whether he should homage the original work, steal from multiple films that have come since, or create his own original idea? Or do we look to director Scott Derrickson and the creative team for having culled together the shots and sequences for the film, and then not knowing how to make some sort of good movie out of it? If they do not care, then why should we? The acting is poor across the board. Connelly, an Oscar-winner, should have known better than to touch this film. She looks stunted and confused in every one of her scenes. I imagine she tried to make something of this awful role, but you would never even guess with the footage that exists in the film. Smith, while playing to his age, seems to be aping his father a little too much. He wants to be spunky, but he wants to try to act method at the same time. With a little more work, he could probably match Will's best work from the mid-1990s, but if he keeps this up, he is destined to become a laughing stock that will annoy audiences. Jon Hamm and Kyle Chandler are given such a small amount of work to do that one must wonder why the filmmakers went with recognizable faces in their roles, while John Cleese and James Hong have such short scenes that you may blink and miss them altogether. Kathy Bates genuinely tries to make something of her juicy role, but it is downplayed far too much.Reeves however, delivers another classic Reeves performance. This role was practically tailored for him to play. He spends most of his time on-screen giving baffled and bizarre looks at the camera, or delivering the stilted dialogue we have come to know him for. He gets no real time to emote in the role, and gets even less time to explain himself. But Reeves is a master of this stoned out technique, and is on his own playing field against the rest of the cast. He has done far greater work (The Matrix trilogy obviously, and my personal guilty pleasure, Speed), but because this role does not ask much of him by way of actual emotion, he soars through as the single best thing about the movie. And yes, I am quite terrified alluding to that idea.Calling The Day the Earth Stood Still disappointing is a bit of a stretch. Calling it awful is a lot better of a description. While the plot sounds like it could make for some interesting science-fiction (especially based off its legendary source material), the film falters and fails too many times to really make anything of itself. There are some great ideas sprinkled throughout the movie, but nothing is ever done with them. They are either brushed away, or outright ignored. Whether it is the boring storyline, the bad acting, the horrendous dialogue, the erratic tonal shifts, or the very inconsistent CGI, the film just has no chance to even attempt to work. And as a movie with a message, it fizzles more often than it sizzles. It has the ideas to go the distance, but lacks the motivation.3/10.(Portions of this review originally appeared on http://www.dvdfanatic.com).",The Day the Earth Stood Still

117,WriterDave,The Day the Audience Shrugged Their Shoulders,1,14 December 2008,"""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is a stunningly inept remake of the 1950's classic of the same name. It's one of those big-budget films so unfathomably dull and inane, you wonder how it ever got made. Whereas the original warned of the dangers of nuclear armament, this modern update boldly chides us for being mean to each other and not taking care of the environment. Gee, Hollywood, thanks for the swell insight! This Christmas season Hollywood teaches us that people can sometimes suck, but only that special kind of film can suck totally. Although the entire production is horrible from top to bottom, the inert direction of Scott Derrickson and the randomly asinine script from David Scarpa bear most of the blame. The screenplay clearly went through arbitrary rewrites, perhaps after being focus-grouped to death, and shows not a single breath of imagination. Around every turn, it wastes opportunities and insults the intelligence of the audience and gives us not one authentic character or moment to connect to. Even when it thinks it's being cool (like the lame reveal that those alien spheres are actually ""arks"" trying to save animal life before the world is annihilated) the script fails miserably. One sphere that is shown on the back of a pick-up truck being attacked by flame-throwers in some foreign desert town inexplicably contains squid, because, well, the shadows of squid inside a giant sphere look kinda neat, that's why! At least the script teaches us one thing. Apparently all you need to do in order to survive an apocalyptic robotic alien insect attack that devours everything in sight is to hide under a bridge in Central Park!The saddest part of the film is how the director wastes his talented cast. The always wooden Keanu Reeves was perfectly chosen to play the alien Klaatu, but even he seems to be disbelieving the words that are coming out of his mouth. Poor Jennifer Connelly, an immensely emotive and alluring actress, appears to be in physical pain or constipated for most the film, obviously stunned she agreed to star in this junk. Kathy Bates and John Cleese apparently showed up only for their paychecks and sleepwalk through their lines, and at one pivotal moment where Bates' Secretary of State attempts to show regret for some bad decisions made, she actually appears to fall asleep in her chair. And then there's poor little Jaden Smith, who appears bored to tears throughout the film and is given no direction from Derrickson except when he is asked to cry on cue in the supposed emotional climax of the picture that left me feeling sorry for all involved.However, if anyone should be hung for this travesty, it's the producers, who must've run out of money at some point and filled the gap in funds with some nauseating product placement. How else do we explain Klaatu's trip to McDonald's for an important meeting with another of his kind? ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is easily the worst film of the year. At least ""The Happening"" had its accidentally humorous moments. This clunker offers no such relief. Even the special effects are done in a lazy and unimaginative manner.

The problem wasn't with the actor because Jaden Smith actually did a good job in playing the role. The problem was with the character itself. I don't see how Klaatuu could possibly have found humanity's redeeming features in a spoiled child coping with his grief by acting out in the annoying way that this child did. Did Jacob's grief perhaps demonstrate humanity's ability to cope with the grief of losing its environmentally destructive ways? Was that it? Also, I was hoping to see the Earth's rotation stopped, but that's not what happens. I won't say what does happen to threaten the existence of Earth, but it's new and interesting.The movie also raised a few interesting ethical issues. I have to admit that this movie has caused me to realise that I also feel that the survival of the planet Earth is more important than the survival of humanity. We were given a paradise and we've destroyed most of it over the last two centuries. I also feel that humanity is unable to stop its environmental destruction of the planet. It's just a matter of time before we ruin it all. We're helpless to stop it. If someone held a referendum on whether mankind should destroy itself in order to save the Earth, I would vote yes and hope that we were not too late.Somehow that become part of my value system, but I'm not sure when or how it happened. This movie reflects a widely held view, I suspect. Call it environmental cynicism. I just don't see how Jacob could save us.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
120,raypdaley182,The Day The Earth Wish He Cast Someone Else,2,14 December 2008,"Keanu Reeves plays a man whose DNA is sampled in 1928 in the Karakoram Mountains in India (no, its never explained why) and used in the ""present day"" (conveniently allowing for the film makers to not let the film feel dated by setting a specific year) to create a body for Klaatu, an alien who represents a group of other worlds who have come to Earth to stop Humans destroying the planet by eradicating all human life and using spheres as modern day arks to save the animal life.Jennifer Connelly plays Helen Benson a sexy scientist who is called in by the government when they detect an object on collision course with Manhattan that they expected to destroy all life only for it to slow down and land in New Yorks Central Park, she is also the ""wicked"" stepmom to her dead husbands son Jacob (played by the extremely annoying Jaden Smith who you will end up hoping he dies more than the kids in Jurassic Park. Yes, he's THAT annoying!).The American Government (run by the Secretary Of Defence played by Kathy Bates, another handy way for the film makers to avoid dating the film by not naming The President or Vice President) react as they always do with force and the alien leaving the craft is hurt and taken into custody to be studied. He heals miraculously and Benson intervenes in his questioning which allows him to escape and go on the run.Klaatu's robot Gort is also captured for study and escapes and commences to remove all traces of life from the planet but Benson and Jacob help him to return to his ship to save the Earth once they show him not all Humans wish to destroy the planet. This entails a visit to a Nobel prize winning Professor (played by John Cleese, personally I would have removed the whole scene with him in as it isn't explained well enough why they are there or how this helps Klaatu learn more about why Human life is worth saving) in a very boring and extremely difficult to follow scene which just seems to be there to slow the action down for a short while.Like M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening earlier this year this is also an extremely preachy film about the environment and how Humans are destroying the planet. It's not a science fiction film and it's certainly no attempt to try and either remake or improve the 1951 Micheal Rennie version of this film where they'd come to stop us all killing each other during the Cold War. If you don't feel like your watching sections of The Happening and Cloverfield at certain points in the movie then you pay absolutely no attention to movies when you watch them. The film is highly unoriginal (not just because its a remake, because it blatantly steals ideas from things like The Happening and Cloverfield and it takes far too long to get to the point where Gort starts wiping the Earth out.The visual effects do look very good but as a whole the film has an incredibly cheap feeling about it (possibly due to the very derivative sections of plot and how long the film takes to actually get anywhere) and you are left feeling very unsatisfied indeed. The ending is extremely weak and left far too open to interpretation as to what happened and what will happen next. Reeves himself plays the role of Klaatu too much like a cut scene from The Matrix, he's very stiff and wooden and you feel a waxwork dummy of him would have done a better (and much cheaper) job of the role. Jennifer Connelly isn't really enough of a star to be playing the female lead (most people will only remember her from Labyrinth) so its pretty pathetic to think Keanu is actually the biggest name in this mainly no-name cast.The director stated Keanu was his 1st and only choice to play Klaatu which reveals several possible things about him - he hasn't got much imagination in regards to casting, he doesn't know many actors (painfully obvious from his wafer thin resume on IMDb.com) or he has no regard for the movie he made so cast the 1st person he could think of. Being forced to watch a movie with a message is fairly annoying at the best of times but when its someone using Hollywood millions to impose their environmental views on the public then its just a waste of effort, time and money that could have been better used if donated to environmental charities instead of ruining a perfectly good science fiction film.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
121,johnnymonsarrat,"Don't listen to the ""remake"" purists",8,15 December 2008,"My heavens, I have rarely seen so many sci-fi purists who think the 1950s were untouchable. Sure, they had the best actors, the least cheesy story lines, and by far the best computer graphics back then, right? We believe so strongly in the ethic of saving the world that we should try to discourage anyone from liking this film, right? It's better if the moral of the film never reaches people's ears? Hardly. The Day the Earth Stood Still is a ride that is both important and moving. It's just not a parroting of the original and that angers some people. The underlying theme, about global pollution, is understated and entirely avoids being preachy. Keanu Reeves is marvelous as the flat affect alien, and while he comes to love humanity that is also understated so it avoids being campy. There are no ""Hasta La Vista Baby"" moments in the film.The aliens are superbly... alien. There are some special effects we haven't seen before in other films and a creative take. The one criticism I might make is the handling of the government (similar to Terminator 3) does not feel at all realistic, with the dialogue and the settings feeling hollow. That being said, the decisions that the government takes make sense. The pacing is good as well, and the scene with John Cleese could have been milked for minutes but was compact and made its point all the better for it. The ending is wrapped up without the corny-sounding ""Klaatu Barada Niktu"".Do you believe that humanity needs to save itself? This is a film you should see. Are you skeptical given all the reviews you've read? If you are a thinker: just go see it.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
122,LazySod,Mediocre at best,6,21 December 2008,"A remake of a classic science-fiction film this film tells the tale of an alien that comes to Earth to give mankind an ultimatum: start behaving better or you get destroyed. In the original film he has a robot with him to protect him and his powers include shutting down every power generator on the planet. In the remake things are a bit different, but not so much that they make the story unrecognizable.The original film is several factors better than this remake, but the remake is still watchable. It plays out rather quick and delivers the message it is supposed to deliver and although it does add quite a bit of computer generated imagery it doesn't completely lean on it. The roles are played out OK, the music score is OK, the story is not too bad (but should have been better) and the overall feel is OK.Still, I'd advise people to watch the original instead.

A 7 foot Gort was perfectly fine, why on Earth make him a 60 foot behemoth? In the 1951 version, Gort didn't have anything to say, but he was imposing and frightening, this one is just big and useless. Michael Rennie's Klatu was perfectly coherent in the 51 original, but not so with Keanu Reeves...""Klaatu barada nikto"" gets totally lost in a nothing scene with Keanu uttering the words, not the heroine!!!The original story revolves around a dire warning for Earth people to start getting along or risk annihilation. That message is completely lost in this translation, lost to a poor quality dialog which actually missed all of the most important lines ever placed in any movie.Is there some movie maker rule somewhere that specifies that a remake must completely trash a classic story? Must be, for this one was trash from the start...no coherent story at all here!p.s.

Every project he is involved in is diminished by his presence and extreme lack of charisma. An iguana has more screen presence than he does.The same with virtually everything else he's done the kid has an unbelievable lack of talent.

Think ""War of the Worlds"" with slightly nicer aliens. But what does it matter?

I thought this was harsh as we've only learned the damages caused from using aerosols and the balloons that come out from power points for 20 or so and are making changes, like green power and catching buses instead of using cars and stuff like that. Scientist Helen Benson (Connelly, in another dull role) and her stepson Jacob (Will Smith's annoying kid) befriend Klaatu and try to change his mind about the killing humans bit. Will they succeed?

134,HelenMary,"Good, if a little sentimental but insightful, propaganda film",7,27 January 2013,"I am not sure why this film didn't do better in the public consciousness. I do know that many resented it's remaking given that the original film (which I am ashamed to say I have not seen) is very popular and a sci-fi cult classic. The film is less than loosely based on the novella by Harry Bates entitled Farewell to the Master, but is so removed from the original story as to be inconsequential. I liked the story but prefer the film. The film is basically about an alien (Klaatu - Keanu Reeves, perfectly cast, even from the book) who comes to Earth to save it, from the human race. We - generally the Americans - are shown as arrogant, egocentric, violent and not very bright; Kathy Bates, US Secretary of Defense shames herself into thinking that she speaks for all mankind just because she speaks for the President of the USA, and she is very much shown to be the villain. Enter Jennifer Connelly (Astro-biologist, Dr Helen Benson) and John Cleese (Nobel laureate Biologist) to try and change his mind. A stellar performance by Jaden Smith as Jacob, Helen's stepson with whom she has a turbulent and difficult relationship, which we see develop and his character is exactly who a boy of his age would be; angry, scared and idealistic but also reliant on adults - his character has a lot of touching moments, very well acted. We as humans are not painted at all well, but realistically, I think, and the film is propaganda for the idea that we ARE killing our planet and we WILL destroy ourselves in destroying it. We do have to unite in peace and ecofriendly togetherness if we are to survive. I feel it is a fairly truthful imagining of what might happen if an ET did land in Central Park, and the SFX are good, the story gripping - quite tense - and whilst this is rather Hollywood, it doesn't end in quite the way you would assume, and is incredibly poignant. All performances were good, well judged and not overdone, and the Direction and overall realisation of the story excellent.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

137,Cinema_Fan,As empty as space and void of personality.,2,13 December 2008,"The undercurrent text may have altered since its birth by author Harry Bates (1900 - 1981), from the 1940 short story Farewell to the Master, to the 1951 film The Day the Earth Stood Still to its modern counterpart we see here today. In hindsight, i.e. human nature, we never seem to change, never seem to want to change, and it is the texture of this contemporary version that we see the same old message: change, adapt, live. But learn.Contemporary, that is the word. This re-mastering of the 1951 sci-fi parable of the warning of the destruction of the Earths peoples' if they are to pursue their relevant course of existence is nothing more than an ego boost and highjacking by the controlling narcissistic superpower of the day. While not comparing the two films, in contrast, each stands on their own merits of intelligence and timeline factors. This supposedly being in a similar vain in tone comes close but still misses the mark.The human race has changed, or has it? Possibly only in advancement of technology, the thinking of major leaders are parallel to the era of the early fifties; mistrust of each other and control of its people, nothing changes. The message here is still relevant; we must reap the seeds we have sown. It is with this distinct message that the human race must come to terms. This is where the film then falters, what may have turned out to be a global concern is then taken hostage by the obtuse governing power.While an important narrative overall, the people of earth are to be sacrificed for the survival of the planet Earth, we are then duly set upon by what can only deemed a mismatch of character development and loss of direction. From the beginning, this seemed to be a doomed episode of casting, the role of Kathy Bates (Regina Jackson), as the Presidents envoy, seemed the equivalent of Old Mother Hubbard. Her staunch exterior and fashionable dress code would not have gone amiss if she were cast in a 1950's St. Trinian's episode. Dire, to say the least. Simply out of place and out of time, literally. Jaden Smith (Jacob Benson) is very quickly forgotten. While giving his character a major role in empathy, we are soon to learn that, some, children are best seen and not heard, an intrusion at best. It is this one-dimensional character based film, with the stereotypical Army staff, Governmental personal and a poorly mixed bag of assortments that gives a clichéd development that both weakens the plot and its delivery.This too does not exclude the fact that the arrival of the most important science fiction character on the Big Screen being so blown to pieces and an exuberant anti-climax since Mr. Lucas decision to animate the Imperial stormtrooper. We now see Gort, updated and tagged with an acronym: Genetically Organized Robotic Technology made of rice papered CGI. Ludicrously too tall and distracting of any threat or believability, here, the adage ""less is more"" would have sufficed. Any imposing threat of this metal space giant is lost in translation due to its overbearing CGI pose and any impact of reality fading away all too quickly. Is there any respect for the classics any more? Cannot the two blend and find a happy medium? A compromise? We see here that it cannot. Will not.The film also continues to sustain the message of necessary change and at the same time absorb itself in the vain reflection of the one country that this alien visitor has landed. Taking hold of current affairs, empathies and loss, mainly seen through the eyes of the young boy, this seems only too familiar with nationalistic prides than to project a narrative of worldly concerns. Maybe so, the young boy's experiences' here could well be a metaphor of how we have succumbed to this predicament of peril but at the same time it only furthers the vanity of a certain view point all too clearly.Unfortunately, here, in 2008, we see a film that has adapted to its own times and events, with at best, banal television actors' ruling the roost, a self-centred narrative, a disappointing metallic presence and the finale worthy of only a few seconds before closing time.

Intelligent sci-fi is the last thing I expect from mainstream Hollywood these days and this pathetic excuse of a film is no exception. The 1951 version of this film was at least, original. Here we are loaded with stupid dialogues, utterly predictable plot twists and the regular dose of how self-destructive humans have superior family values than technologically advanced alien civilizations. And we have morals, people... that if you throw litter in the park and screw the environment a giant alien ball will come from the sky to kick your ass.Keanu Reeves is so good at playing aliens, androids or the glum depressed mental. Here his Klaatu is very apt. Jennifer Connelly is a good versatile actress who deserves better lines and better roles. But what I understand is that she has to star in these movies once in a while to pay the bills. Jaden Smith and Kathy Bates are good as the cute kid and the tough defense minister respectively, but good performances only work well with good script, which sadly is missing. Even Gort, the giant robot, is so badly used in the film. The 1951 version at least had Gort as a very interesting element of the story.Oh and the 4 stars are for special visual and sound effects.

We go on to discover that an unknown object is hurtling toward Earth at thousands of miles per hour and will impact somewhere on the East Coast approximately smack in the middle of Central Park which has obviously recovered from Clovy's attack. One of the elite team opines that it will scour the earth when it hits which from me would have set my sphincter on edge as the team member mentions this just as we approached .....you guessed it.....Manhattan Island. So we have established that something monumental is happening and that the people in charge are complete and utter idiots. Surely the team should be heading as fast as they can in the opposite direction? What use will they be when they are all blasted to atoms? But as luck would have it the object is a giant Xmas bauble and just in time slows down and lands. As well as the idiot elite team we are joined by the US army and NYPD who also are too stupid to flee in the opposite direction. Then the bauble opens and out steps a seemingly friendly but obviously stupid alien who declares war by extending a hand and is promptly shot. Ooops! As said alien is comforted by the obligatory pretty scientist who should appear but .....you guessed it.....a bloody big robot who p*ssed that his boss was shot the second he landed is about to kick some human ass and wake up this movie only for .....you guessed it.....stupid alien to recover a bit and shout some meaningless drivel and robot takes a break. Thus ends the decent 10/15 minutes and begins the utterly incomprehensible last 75 as we find out that George W is hiding in a shoe cupboard and has put a rather sinister and completely insane woman in charge. The alien is then told he is being held by the USA in a secure facility, threatened with torture and confined whilst his robot mate after being attacked with sidewinder missiles is encased in a box. Why did the mad woman imagine that a spaceship that has travelled billions of miles would give a monkeys that a few pathetic missiles were fired at it. Have none of these people ever seen a movie before? Cue a truly pathetic interrogation scene where alien kicks interrogators ass and steals his suit. Though what the point was of asking the guy his suit size is beyond me. If it had been too big or small would the alien have asked the interrogator to send in a thin bloke about six foot with a 34 inch leg? Alien then legs it and hooks up with pretty scientist and her totally annoying step kid who ruins completely whatever shard of credibility was left after the first half hour. We then discover to our horror that stupid alien and his robot have come to .....you guessed it.....cleanse the Earth of US as we are destroying the planet with all out tomfoolery...... A filler scene, during an advert for McDonalds, with stupid alien A talking about bugger all with another stupider alien B, who is for no discernible reason living here, is then rapidly followed by an even more pointless scene with a has been Brit comedian Professor where alien discovers we are not so bad after all. Helped by a bit of Bach along the way although I wonder what would have happened in the Prof had been listening to Motorhead. Stupid alien looks across room in wonder. Prof says....'it's Lemmy from Hawkwind' .....alien says 'it's beautiful'. Alien begins to warm to us by being in direct proximity to pretty scientist and annoying brat who at one stage wants to kill alien. But alas we are running short of time and budget so all hell breaks loose as robot turns into a swarm of insects and kicks ass at last. Cue a lot of pointless army guys firing rockets and stuff and a general reports to mad woman in charge who asks where the swarm is going.....'it's going everywhere'......'but mainly central Park'. A couple of bits of destruction and a few pointless scenes between alien and annoying kid later we find that alien has now seen the error of his ways and plans to help us. Back in central park under the rebuilt bridge from Cloverfield we find ourselves within the swarm of destructive insects that have destroyed everything in their path but seem incapable of damaging the bridge. Alien says he can stop this but the price will be high. Cue absolutely rubbish last 5 minutes and that is it. A truly horrendous sci-fi blockbuster. Has Hollywood not learnt yet that cutesy kids and dogs should die horribly in the first 20 minutes to give the audience some light relief.The original was a great topical movie and this could have been as well but it degenerates rapidly into the formulaic Hollywood blockbuster with cruddy effects and a script written by an idiot who seems not to comprehend just how stupid the actions of his characters really are.Unlike many here I am not down on Keanu as I like the guy a lot but the actors can only work with the slop they are given and this was sewage.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
142,higherall7,THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL-(2008)-Movie Review,4,21 March 2011,"THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (2008)""-passion but no com-passion-""-Jack Palance as Jesus Razafrom THE PROFESSIONALS(1966) Directed by Richard BrooksThis is sure not your Father's version of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL! All works of Art can be considered to reflect the times in which they are made. That being said, this version of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is indeed a creature of its times.The present movie is couched more within the environmental consciousness of Rachel Carson and Global Warming than the Cold War realities of Uncle Sam Versus the Russkies. It has a faster Spielbergian pace owing to the influence of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and films generated thereafter and a darker tone. Director Scott Derrickson presents us with state-of-the-art CGI Special Effects and a GORT as impressive as anything stepping out of a Marvel Comic Book. The Screenplay focuses more on Klaatu as a man on the run ala THE FUGITIVE and eschews any notion of him needing a tour guide among the natives to point out the sights.Since this is a product of the 21st Century and the Information Age, the Science feels more authentic and you will be hard put to find obvious howlers. You may recall how in the original version Klaatu spoke of having traveled 250 million miles to Earth, which would have put his starting point somewhere inside our Solar System just this side of the Asteroid Belt! The Music Score is driving and suspenseful, but somehow less memorable than that creepy Theremin in the original version. But this is a matter of personal taste, so you be the judge on that.Keanu Reeves play the title role of Klaatu, but no mild associations with Honest Abe, Sherlock Holmes or even Jesus Christ here. He plays Klaatu with a cold, grim gravitas; but it lacks the wry humor and gentlemanly civility of Michael Rennie's interpretation. Whereas warmth and compassion seems woven into the warp and woof of the 1951 version, the characters in this 21st Century remake, like Jennifer Connelly playing Helen Benson, seem to be searching for it or are too involved with the technology or organizational strategy to put such concerns on their 'to do' list. An Alien landing on a planet where the people themselves are numbly walking through and attempting to extricate themselves from a sense of alienation that they just can't shake loose, such as in THE GRADUATE, would have been an interesting theme to explore and develop, but besides an obvious homage to ALPHAVILLE in Klaatu's escape from the hospital, this theme is barely touched upon.This was a judgment call, I believe, by the Writer and Director that in the end just didn't pay off. Opting to go colder and darker with the tone of the story, Klaatu's relationship with Bobby as played by Jaden Smith comes across as strained and distant; even at times conveying undertones of resentment. They are both like two misunderstood children, surly and uncomfortable in each other's presence. This was meant to increase the dramatic tension with an interesting twist, but the charm of Klaatu as the avuncular guardian and teacher to little Bobby has found its way needlessly to the cutting room floor.There are two scenes that are meant to emphasize Klaatu's sense of alienation in the midst of these humans. One is at a train station where he doctors a vending machine to get himself a Chicken Salad sandwich and without offering any to the little boy watching him, stands idly by while a man getting his pocket picked has a heart attack or stroke. The other scene is where Bobby brings him to the cemetery to exhume his dead father, having already seen him raise a police officer from the dead. It is at this point that he waxes philosophical about how there are some things he cannot do. Thus, in two key scenes where he could have gotten the audience to sympathize with him, he leaves us cold and standing off to the side with Bobby.Right now, I am chuckling mischievously about this. The fact is it would have really been a source of awe and wonder to see Klaatu somehow plausibly bring a Black Man back to life, and would have resurrected some of the family and community feeling that the Writer and Director killed of in the beginning. But then, who am I fooling? Klaatu might arrive on Earth in a placenta Space Suit made of whale blubber, but bring a person of color back from the grave? I will let you imagine the possibilities while you ask yourself what universe I am coming from.The thing that stood out about the 1951 version of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is that everyone from the leads to the supporting characters to extras appeared to have that gravitas that we only attribute to Morgan Freeman these days. Why is that?But this is the 21st Century, Jack, and who am I to take umbrage at a film that grossed over 300 million worldwide?Good Times For All,Eligah",The Day the Earth Stood Still
143,Jay_Exiomo,If it ain't broke...,4,11 December 2008,"Following last year's ""I am Legend"" from Warner Bros., directed by Frank Lawrence and starring Will Smith, is 20th Century Fox's ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" a cautionary tale directed by Scott Derrickson (""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"") and starring a sleepwalking Keanu Reeves and Jennifer Connelly. And so it goes. Another year, another remake of a film tackling an apocalyptic theme that deals with the extinction of the human race. And New York City is once again at the forefront of the events.Adapting the 1951 sci-fi classic to fit contemporary issues, David Scarpa's reworking of Edmund H. North's 1951 screenplay substitutes the issue of global warming in place of themes of Cold War. Klaatu (Reeves), a representative of a highly intelligent extra-terrestrial civilization, comes to Earth to save it from the human race who have been gradually destroying the planet.Initially, he attempts for a dialog with the Earth's leaders, but when his requests are not granted, he decides that the only way to save the planet is to annihilate humankind. It's up to astrobiologist Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) and her stepson Jacob (Jaden Smith) to convince Klaatu that it's not too late for humans to change and save the world.The film initially holds promise with a sense of tension and urgency that feels about to unspool anytime. Sadly that moment never comes as the whole proceedings play out. Despite a serviceable CGI, there's neither a memorable performance from Reeves nor Connelly, and the experience feels more like a long delayed sequel of ""Independence Day,"" only blander.As the film clocks in more running time, the less sense of urgency it delivers, capping it with a denouement that's so emotional, aliens finally believe humans can undo the damage and indeed save earth. If only they can also undo the disservice this film does to the classic...",The Day the Earth Stood Still
144,mirosuionitsaki2,Excellent.,9,14 March 2009,"Yep, another remake of a movie rated with 5/10 because people who saw the original movie first can't help but point out the flaws instead of realizing that both movies are just two different movies by two different directors who made the movie the way they want it and still kept some important details, and sometimes take some important details out. If you just pretended you were watching an original movie and you never saw the other one, that's how you should review.That being said, I loved this movie and I do not plan to watch a poorly made 50s movie with a huge lack of CGI and effects. But, who knows? Maybe I will watch it. One thing that bothers me is the boy. Jacob is so annoying that you just want to go up into his face and tell him to shut up. I really dislike when he butts in on the story. He walks out of the car, walks to a different part of the forest and makes the scene emotional instead of exciting, and I hate when he complains about how much he loves his father, because we've all seen this in movies before and I'm just sick of it. In the movie, the world is going to end. Just shut up and worry about yourself, then worry about your father after Human Civilization changes and all coffins in the world are destroyed so humans can decompose naturally.This movie was excellent. At first, the extraterrestrial who looks like a regular Human being but not at first when he sheds his skin, was very annoying when he talked. ""I do not know that of which you are speaking to be concerned with us and that is the final thing because she is."" There's no that's and she's and it's. Maybe once in a while, but he pretty much pauses after one word like Race to Witch Mountain. I wonder if the old one of both movies did that. But, what ever. This movie was excellent any way. I enjoyed how the one who listens to the president, the eyes and the ears of the president I guess is what I should be typing, acted. She was not too bossy, she gave in, she wanted to convince the aliens that we will change. The president only said one thing that would change her plans, so that was pretty much the only sign of the president being stupid. Most likely, it was Bush because.. 2008. Yeah.Overall, this movie is excellent, and all in good fun. It has a message, but at least it didn't give it in the way Plan 9 From Outer Space did, too. Also, if you hate sci-fi movies set completely at night and rarely in light, you'll love this. It proves that extraterrestrials can come at night, and still be alive at day.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
145,galahad58-1,Not a Bad Movie,6,12 December 2008,"The Day the Earth Stood Still is not a bad remake, but it is also not a super retelling of an old classic. Keanu Reeves is the best part of the movie. His cardboard performance works in this film even better than in the Matrix. Reeves allows the film to move at a nice pace and adds to the film. John Cleese is very good in a limited part. Cleese's role could have been expanded to allow more of a human and intelligent touch to the movie. The special effects are very very good and the new version of GORT is a lot better than the old metal suit from the original movie. There are two big negatives in this film: the child's constant negativity and aggressiveness are very unappealing. The character was unnecessary and took a lot out of the movie. The second is the pitiful Jennifer Connelly. How this woman is doing movies is beyond me--she has no talent whatsoever. A better actress should have been chosen to give some needed humanity to the role. Connelly is so wooden, that you don't give a damn if she dies or not. The emotional ending the movie needed was ruined by both Connelly and Jaden Smith (who is not talented like his father Will). Overall I would give this film a 6--the ending, Jaden Smith and Jennifer Connelly take away what could have been an 8.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
146,TheHande,A competent visual spectacle,8,14 December 2008,"The Day The Earth Stood Still is a movie that has many strong areas. It's audio-visually compelling with a story-line which gives it important substance and actor performances that don't require questioning or scrutiny. The film presents an even package which is definitely very impressive at first but evens out towards the ending of the film.Klaatu is undoubtedly the dramatic core of the film, a character with a robotic coldness to his view of the natural order. The film provides a rather good compact dissection into the problems of humanity and though the film may feel slightly preachy in places the message of the film is clear and coherent. I honestly can't compare the movie with the original as I've not seen it but I believe the film has been successful in conveying to film the essential themes of the original.In all general areas of film The Day The Earth Stood Still is competent but it is perhaps not the most original or compelling film of its kind. It's a competent movie no doubt and worth seeing even if you're not familiar with the original film. A good film.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
147,gregeichelberger,"Hollywood, Reeves try to ruin another classic film",2,25 January 2012,"Originally published on Dec. 8, 2008: I'm angry.Yes, I think I've finally reached my breaking point on bad and unnecessary movie remakes. This is not a new phenomenon, but it seems recently more and more are being ripped off from superior films.And I think I've been very tolerant, sitting through pale imitations of better originals such as ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" ""The Invasion,"" ""Poseidon,"" ""Psycho,"" ""Planet of the Apes,"" ""The Heartbreak Kid,"" ""The Shaggy Dog,"" ""All the King's Men,"" ""King Kong,"" ""Alfie,"" ""War of the Worlds,"" ""Yours, Mine and Ours,"" ""Cheaper By the Dozen,"" ""Thomas Crown Affair,"" ""Gone In 60 Seconds,"" ""The Producers,"" ""Hairspray,"" ""Father of the Bride,"" ""Bad News Bears,"" ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" ""Halloween,"" ""Flight of the Phoenix,"" ""Mr. Deeds (Goes to Town),"" ""The Exorcist"" and ""Around the World in 80 Days."" Just to name a few ...Hollywood, it seems is also so bereft of ideas that the industry even remakes bad films into worse ones, i.e. ""The Fog,"" ""Amityville Horror,"" ""The Alamo,"" ""Fun With Dick and Jane,"" ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" ""The Hills Have Eyes"" ""The Longest Yard,"" ""Walking Tall,"" ""Stepford Wives"" and ""Prom Night."" What is it that makes actors, directors, writers and/or others think that they can produce a movie better than Alfred Hitchcock or John Ford or Stanley Kubrick or Robert Rossen or William Friedkin or Sam Peckinpah or John Frankenheimer or John Waters, among others? Is it the lack of any original concepts or just a plain gargantuan ego? Some say the updating of technology adds a lot to these new versions, but I cannot agree.It takes more than just massive doses of CGI to improve an original work. All I can say is that I am more than tired of watching these new individuals try to massage their own bizarre fantasies.But, as a man of peace, I was more than content to go along with this Tinsel Town charade, safe in the knowledge that I can still watch the motion pictures these inferior remakes were based upon.However, with the release this week of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" starring Keanu Reeves, I can no longer contain my smoldering anger.The original 1951 film, directed by Robert Wise (who later won Oscars for ""West Side Story"" and ""The Sound of Music), told the tale of an alien craft landing in Washington, D.C.A suave extraterrestrial, Klaatu (Michael Rennie, ""The Robe""), informs the human race they must cease the nuclear arms race and to stop all the fighting, or the planet will have to be destroyed.He is backed by a huge indestructible robot named Gort, so people start to fall in line.The picture also starred Patricia Neal (who won a Best Actress Academy Award for ""Hud"" in 1963), Sam Jaffe (nominated for ""The Asphalt Jungle""), Hugh Marlowe (""All About Eve,"" ""Meet Me in St. Louis""), Billy Gray (""Father Knows Best"") and Francis Bavier (best known as Aunt Bee on ""The Andy Griffith Show"").There are many reasons why this newest version was the straw that broke my back. First of all, it stars Keanu Reeves. Second, it changes the whole nuke premise to a showdown on global warming. Politically correct AND Keanu Reeves — what's next, Al Gore in the lead role in E.T.? Here, Reeves plays a sleepwalking Klaatu (think Mr. Spock meets Steven Wright on downers — even more low key than Reeves usually appears on screen, if that's remotely conceivable) who tells the nations of the world that they are ruining the Earth and if they don't knock it off, bad things will happen (look, being forced to watch this tripe is punishment enough).Even the inclusion of two past Oscar winners, Kathy Bates (as a disbelieving Secretary of Defense) and Jennifer Connelly (failing the Patricia Neal role completely) does not help.And former Monty Pythonite, John Cleese, subbing for Jaffe's professor, isn't enough.Then, of course, the inclusion of the son of Will Smith (who plays one of filmdom's single most annoying, obnoxious moppets ever), is an even worse move; as is replacing the all-powerful Gort's death ray with a bizarre contraption that just destroys monuments such as Shea Stadium and the Eiffel Tower, among other landmarks.I didn't know Shea Stadium was a ""landmark."" Anyway ...Another major problem I had was the whole ""ark"" sequences, where numerous otherworldly craft land in different locations while animals just seem to throw themselves on board.Oh,all right, let's face it, I had problems with just about every aspect of this movie, why bore you by listing them all.Then, just when he's about to wipe out everything, Klaatu hears some Bach and sees Connelly hug her hellish spawn of a son. Does this change anything? Well, you'll have to see the film to find out any more than this.Although I don't recommend paying to see it.Instead, wait for it to come out on DVD, have someone else purchase it and then you can borrow it. Of course, only if every other motion picture ever made — in any era by any species on any planet — somehow disappears.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
148,fjhuerta-2,"OK, I suppose",4,12 December 2008,"It's just a shame this movie wasn't based on ""Farewell to the Master"". Because there's just no way it would ever be compared favorably to the original. Everyone was just too busy with special effects to give Klaatu a personality, Gort a meaning, and the story a chance to develop itself. It's entertaining. Its heart is in the right place. Sadly, someone should tell Keanu Reeves acting isn't confined to making confused faces and mumbling the entire picture. The Matrix, Constantine and now this movie - it's as if he's playing the same character (himself?) all the time. Here's an idea. Instead of remaking a classic, why not take any other B-grade comic story from the 1950's? At least that way it would never be compared against the original.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
149,masercot,Not Bad,7,11 May 2017,"A lot of people don't like this film. Even I thought that casting Keanu Reeves as someone from outer space was a little redundant. But, it was on and I was bored so I started watching. And, kept watching; and, at bed time I recorded the rest.It is not the same movie as the original. That is a good thing. The original movie was great for its time; however, the old plot set in modern times would look uber-dumb. Also, I have to doubt that the authorities would've reacted so cartoonishly militaristic as they are depicted, in this day and age; but, maybe I'm an optimist.So, instead of turning off the world's power, the aliens bring metal-eating robots that threaten to devour us all. We are on the brink of destruction, as they mention once or twice. The deaths from these creatures gives the film a very different feel than the original.Bates and Cleese do well in their performances. As always, Reeves plays stunned well. If you don't expect the original and you don't question things very hard, this is not a bad movie.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
150,kevinxirau,A very thought-provoking sci-fi remake.,7,1 September 2011,"Based on the book titled ""Farewell to the Master"" by Harry Bates, The Day The Earth Stood Still (both versions) is a well known story that points out a lot of things about life, mainly ourselves, like war and pollution. Now everyone knows the plot: the alien Klaatu, accompanied by his giant robot GORT, comes to to save the planet from ourselves.Obviously this movie is big on special effects which for the most part are pretty good, from the sphere-like ships to GORT himself. GORT really brings a sense of ominous dread to him, whether he's attacking or just staring at the poor humans around him. Keanu Reeves is really good as Klaatu, his expressionless face and calm voice seem to fit the role, creating a mysterious atmosphere around him as great as his telepathic abilities. Everyone else is good, except for Jaden Smith who's just annoying. John Cleese was great as the professor and his conversation with Klaatu about comparing humanity to Klaatu's own race was just excellent.Overall, this movie is pretty realistic in terms of how we would react to a situation like this and its morals are substantial. I do recommend this to anyone who loves science fiction.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
151,twanster-97655,No sequel ruined it..,7,8 May 2020,"The movie is great, it has good pace, great CGI and a good story. Great cast (minus Smith)
My biggest problem is the lack of explanation. This movie cries out for a franchise but it ends with nothing. Just the sphere leaving and all electrical activity gone from earth. Would he amazing to see a sequel about mankind trying to move forward with no tech, maybe even becoming angry that we've been bullied by another species.. Who knows!
I generally avoid films with young Smith in because his only credentials for staring in films is his dad's lastname. Keano says very little but plays the role brilliantly. I just wish there was more to it all... They could have even made this an extra hour longer just to give it more of a plot and development but the ending is just frustrating.

152,LukeCustomer2,Actually quite good.,7,30 May 2021,"The start of this movie is majorly impressive. We start of with Dr. Helen Benson, just living her normal life until she is scooped up one night by the feds in what appears to be a major - emergency. Eventually Helen learns there is something coming at the planet which will impact in just one hour. She and other scientists are there when the object arrives but -- it doesn't impact. It just parks in central park and shoot out an alien. Eventually we learn that there are others out there in the universe who are more concerned about the planet than us and are here to save -- the planet. The first hour of this movie is pretty engrossing.Keanu Reeves was quite good in this. Playing yet another emotionless character. He, and the script, are stand outs.Jennifer Connolly is ok but she is unfortunately saddled with a somewhat stock character. Damsel in distress / compassionate woman that makes the alien see what is good about humanity.I will say it.. Jaden Smith really is glaringly bad. First as an actor all he does is whine.. second.. whoever wrote this seems to think that it is ok for kids to be completely out of control brats. Jaden acted like that kid you want to punch in Wal-mart on a busy day -- and you just want to scream at Jennifer Connolly to shut that kid up. In theory I suppose you could say it helped the alien see how humanity was just struggling on its own but it is kind of painful to watch.The environmental theme was a little annoying especially since the movie has so many lovely shots of the environment, but I suppose it was as good as any reason for aliens to finally show up.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

There are two notable characters in this film: the female scientist played by Jennifer Connelly and the little kid played by Jaden Smith. The scientist is ridiculous, totally unbelievable, and the little kid is irritating to the nth degree, totally annoying. Special mention goes to Kathy Bates who is unconvincing as a government big-wig. At least she provided a few guffaws, and kudos to makeup and costume for making her look so asinine. Keannu Reeves was Keannu Reeves, nothing more, nothing less. The film itself is a whole lot less. A major waste. In all respects. Shame, shame, shame.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
154,pinkliz41,An average movie,6,13 December 2008,"Review: At best, The Day the Earth Stood Still is an average film. It's at-times solid acting is let down by Derrickson's story telling and exploration of the plot. As a remake of the 1951 sci-fi thriller the story follows an alien visitor (Reeves) and his giant robot counterpart who visit Earth to give warning of an impending attack on the human race.Derrickson direction as with his story telling is, at times compelling and brilliant but by the nest scene it's slipping all over the place. Reeves plays The Alien visitor quite well but can get distracting as in some scenes their is no real life or meaning to what he's saying.Verdict: At times TDTESS is wonderful and you can feel the urge and charisma but unfortunately in a whole the film crashes and burns in most scenes.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

156,krzysiektom,OK but could have been much better . GORT rules.,7,18 December 2008,"Well I liked the kid. I think he played quite all right. U see he was a kid mourning the death of his father in a sulky, passive aggressive way, until his blockade broke in the cemetery scene. It was all facade until then. Keanu: wooden as usual, must be the most overrated star in Hollywood, that dude really cannot act, I think even Schwartzi is better and Stallone much a better actor than Keanu. But that inability was OK here, as he portrayed an alien devoid of emotions. Must admit that all the scenes with GORT impressed me, there was something about that thing, it is enormous and menacing, and they played the right kind of music, the entire cinema was quiet during those scenes. The actress used to be hot and beautiful, she is now one of those too-thin actresses, so dry almost anorexic. Too bad. The script had several weaknesses, they gather a small group of scientists but then only she is allowed near the alien, the alien says the plan was put in motion and nothing can stop it yet then he does stop it. Why?? Just because the kid and the woman showed emotions he realizes ""there is another side to u""? Daa, how banal, if those aliens were so clever and much more advanced wouldn't they have had infiltrated human world much earlier and found all there is to find? Sort of like the aliens in ""The 3rd rock from the Sun"" did (in a much more funny, poignant and intelligent manner than here)? And what exactly did the alien witness to change his mind? I saw almost nothing there, at least nothing to justify a change of a sophisticated plan to wipe out an entire race from an entire planet. That was simplistic and disappointing. But interesting was to see how the film tries to include various elements of the biblical myths into the story: locust, the God's wrath at the human race, the figure of a Godsend Savior who inhabits human flesh and can resurrect the dead... I liked Kathy Bates' portrayal of a US politician who thinks that problems might be solved by force and who dresses in a horrible way like Hillary Clinton or Barbra Bush. But I did not get these moments: when the alien is tested by a polygraph and destroys the interviewer, wouldn't there be many cameras in the room to see what was happening? When the alien is getting through the locust towards the mother sphere wouldn't his human casket get totally destroyed in a moment? We saw the locust eat up even metal parts before...",The Day the Earth Stood Still
157,mr_popcorn,Al Gore's worst nightmares comes true...,6,11 December 2008,"Al Gore's worst nightmares comes true in this remake of the 1951 sci-fi classic and stars Keanu Reeves as Klaatu, the alien visitor who warns the human race of its impending doom. The Day the Earth Stood Still is yet another one of those remakes that fails to deliver all the stops and you would think that they had better left the original version untouched. It starts out strong, the mood was built and the tension was high as the mysterious big blue sphere descends in the middle of New York city. I have to admit, I was holding my breath during those minutes, it was a perfect recreation of the original scene and at that time it seemed like the remake was going places. But as the movie goes on it can't help but fall out the wagon several times and as it reaches its climactic conclusion, a feeling of disappointment takes over. It ended abruptly and the movie itself runs in a very short amount of time. Instead of ending it prematurely, they could have emphasized on Klaatu's decision in the end. That part did look like it was rushed. The ending was bad and Klaatu's decision made it worse. I didn't believe that he really got the proof that humans can change.The acting however, was impressive to say the least. Keanu Reeves knocked it out of the park playing an alien with an ice cold stare and a deep blue voice. He's so good at playing wooden, mysterious and out of this world characters, from Neo in The Matrix to John Constantine in Constantine. I believe it is his field of expertise and this one is right up his alley. Jennifer Connelly, with the given material holds out on her own and worked with what was given to her. The underlying themes was conveyed, its relevancy to the Earth's current situation was delivered and I feel like this film, although a bit of a mess at times, is a strong statement in our society today and at the things that we do in our planet.Moral of the story: If you do not throw your trash in the right place, a big blue ball will come to Earth and destroy humankind as we know it. So think twice before you act.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

159,moutonbear25,"I couldn't sit still, let alone stand.",4,13 December 2008,"I don't know about the earth standing still but I certainly had a hard time moving after this one finished. I think I may have been in shock. I didn't know they still made movies as bad as this. That's me, I guess; the eternal optimist, thinking one day Hollywood will see the error of their ways. I'm starting to think there's a greater chance of aliens landing in Manhattan though. You don't take a highly regarded classic like THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL and update it for no reason other than to make a few bucks. Sure, you can pretend there is purpose; you can cash in on the current environmental crisis fears by insinuating that aliens have come to earth to save the planet from the horrifically unappreciative human race. When you make a film with such disregard for quality though, you can't do anything to convince me that you actually care about what you're trying to say.I will give Hollywood this though; they have finally found the perfect vehicle for the now- veteran Hollywood actor, Keanu Reeves. Reeves plays Klaatu, an alien in human form who has no capacity of expressing human emotion or understanding the intricacies of human nature and interaction. It might as well say that at the top of Reeves's resume so this is Reeves in his element. Honestly though, this is the first time I can say that Reeves's presence in a film has absolutely nothing to do with why it is unwatchable. You know you have a problem when dialogue is so bad that it even drags Reeves's acting down. In fact, having the familiar Reeves on board for this uneventful journey, alongside the strikingly beautiful, Jennifer Connelly, at least gives us something pretty to distract us from the banality of the entire affair. Klaatu certainly rocks that three-piece suit though.The earth is supposed to stand still on this particular day because aliens have descended upon Central Park in a giant weather sphere of sorts. It is a momentous occasion, one that could be the sign of the end of days. Yet, in THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, panic hardly seems to be in the air. Panic comes from a fear of the unknown and an inability to see a solution to your problems but David Scarpa's script is so painstakingly obvious and formulaic that you can see right through to the end at all times. I hope I'm not giving anything away here but as if this film would finish with humanity's extinction. And when the devices used to create the melodrama are so laughably contrived (who knew that a white step mom and a black step son could have such hard times getting along?), at least you have the special effects to revel in. Mind you, when the special effects are even more ridiculous than the ensuing melodrama in a big sci-fi pic like this, what is there to keep you sitting still, let along standing?You'll never believe this but humanity, or at least the American government run portion of humanity, take immediate military action against the alien invaders before giving them the chance to make their case. This next bit is even more shocking. Apparently, violence is not the answer to solving our problems. I swear, I learned so many hard life lessons watching this movie. Perhaps the most important lesson though is that humanity will never learn. THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL represents the same disposable and commercial interests that are the root of our environmental problems. Yet, here is it preaching against the very values that justify its existence. For that reason alone, I would consider this film to be one of the most hopeless (and hapless) films of the year. We're essentially doomed so I say you can take it, Klaatu. Earth is all yours. We clearly don't deserve it.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
160,honorhorror,"Decently made, but not entirely satisfying and convincing.",6,10 December 2008,"The Day The Earth Stood Still is a decently made, well-paced Sci-fi thriller/disaster film. It's based on the acclaimed 1951 sci-fi classic with the same title.After a mysterious shining sphere descending to the Central Park, NY, the whole world starts to panic. A beautiful micro-biologist(Jennifer Connelly) was one of the top scientists sent to investigate the sphere. Not knowing the consequences coming with violence, the army shot at the alien coming out of the sphere. Lately, the alien survived and transformed into the human form for only one purpose--to warn the whole human being...Well, we all know the original film was made during the Cold War, which the film's theme was relevant to. Half a century later, the earth hasn't be destroyed by nuclear weapons but is already saturated with this type of movies, and people are more skeptical than ever before. In my perception, ""Alien come to earth for salvation"" theme is not fresh anymore, and the movie's concept is very roughly implemented, due to the unconvincing story. Basically the film assumes there are superior life forms from outer-space civilizations, without explaining more about such civilizations. The alien, palely portrayed by Keanu Reeves, carries out his mission without serious sense. He decided that human can't be persuaded and can't change their destructing nature based on how a group of people treated him. Later, he abandoned the prior decision based on the perception of a woman's selflessness to her child. I mean, doesn't he have to investigate more into the human society to make the decision, when the decision is to kill all the human or not? Doesn't he learn enough about mother-son relationship before he ""feel"" the affection between human before he made the final decision? Doesn't he even learn human philosophy so he would know that what's right about an individual is not necessarily right about the whole society? Or, does he only have the concept of species instead of individual? The movie simply rises more questions like this, draining out energy from the main theme. So, I am sorry but the movie can't convince me at all. I admit the pace is good, the visuals are fine and some performances are nice, but they are all just stylish wrapping outside a hollow concept.It's supposed to be a movie make you think, but it turned out to be a movie make money from you and let you go without being touched.6/10",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Some weak CGI and plot holes (I'll say they were edited out rather than missed from the get go). Reeves is supposed to be an emotionless alien, why the flack for being wooden? He's got a good gig going as the #1 sci-fi lead. Bates was fine as an Albright/Rumsfield type cabinet secretary, the movie even poked fun at the US for speaking for the whole world.

You get a good 90-minute nap is what. The Abyss this is not. Haven't we had enough movies about how humans are bad about taking care of our planet and some alien life wants to get rid of us in order to save Earth? What I find absolutely non-believable in any of these movies is the fact that some very advanced civilization travels millions of light years and we aim some AK47 at the Mother Ship. Which brings to mind a funny scene in the movie, Mars Attacks! The military shoots off a nuclear missile and the Martians capture the energy and the Martian leader then sucks it up like the gas in a helium balloon. But I digress. This latest remake has to be one of the worst ever, and even stellar actors like Connelly and Bates cannot save this sucker. Can we set aside remakes for a while Hollywood?

Nowhere in real life (not that this film even attempted real life) would a 10 yr old kid be in control of the adults actions, why doesn't she just leave him with a friend or neighbor while she goes to save the world??? I was actually hoping that something disastrous would happen to him so we could get him off the screen. Jaden Smith may be the most annoying child actor I have seen in some time, daddy Smith has been trying to push this wooden puppet on us and it's just not working, the kid acts like his crap doesn't stink, but he sure does. Look at the publicity photos of him, he's so special, wait 5 years when he's a spoiled handful. Oh, and the movie itself?

It's a big movie with an intimate feel. Keanu Reeves' portrayal is pretty spot on, I think (although I have never met an alien, afaik). It made perfect sense within its framework, and that is pretty much a good thing with any movie. A lot of movies have grand special effects, lots of explosions, huge acting, but those things don't cover up for lack of story cohesion, they are a sort of consolation, and these days, may even be the only reason people go to see them. This one has a great story, and I think everything is pulled together almost perfectly. As for John Cleese, if people can't watch him without remembering his Monty Python days, they are failing to see the person. He played his role very nicely, imho. Yup, good movie, good acting, a different feel from most 'alien' movies. That may be what some people are griping about. The aliens and their actions aren't conforming to what they feel they should be, based on other movies, and there's no great big brawny hero, just a woman and her son :) Not a 'Hollywood movie' in feel - I like it better for that.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

166,stevepat99,Love the Original....Cool on IMAX!,7,21 December 2008,"First, as to the many thumbs down IMDb reviews let us take a collective deep breath and one full step back. The mainstream LA Times movie critic gave the film his thumbs up. More to the point 46.5% of IMDb's 7,908 reviews gave the film SEVEN to TEN stars! 13% of those viewers gave the film TEN STARS. If we toss in SIX star reviews then a whopping 59.8%, the overwhelming majority of IMDb reviewers, gave the film SIX to TEN stars.My expectations for the film were low going in BUT my IMAX expectations were higher. The latter proved spot on. This was a cool film to enjoy on the IMAX screen. It had a very good music track. It's excellent special effects have deservedly been nominated for a Satellite Award (prior nominees Lord of the Rings, Independence day etc.). That was reason enough for me to head to my IMAX and reason enough for me to enjoy the film from start to finish.Of course there is the flip side, the reasons I could never go ten stars on this one. The screen writers created an annoying kiddie brat out of Jaden Smith's (Jennifer's son) character. There was his never ending 'my dad would kill him' mantra, hard core disdain for his step mother, his insistence on using her first name and a scene where he fails to utter a single word of remorse when his 'act' inadvertently but never the less results in the death of numerous innocent soldiers.As for other actors, Keanu Reeves and his oftentimes emotionless gaze were well cast. Jennifer Connelly, at least in my cinema book, does few cinema 'wrongs.' Here she does well as a one woman 'army' with the burden of her world saving mission. Cathy Bates does OK in her brief scenes, playing a snarly, grump faced Secty of State.After some thought I realize that in both films Klaatu arrives on Earth with the same mission, to WARN Earthlings before it is too late. In this version the mission changes when Klaatu is denied an opportunity to address the peoples of the world via the U.N. The intervention of John Cleese, playing the Jaffe; Professor Barnhardt, blackboard and all, is a welcome reprise. His meaningful discussion with Klaatu is the lynch pin of the films conclusion and in fact makes sense. After all, Klaatu had authority to WARN Earth, to change his mission and hence to change it 'again' as the film rolls toward its conclusion. There is nothing to prevent Klaatu's return to Earth in the near distant future should that prove necessary.The above, along with suspense of belief, is sufficient to permit Klaatu to react to his minimal albeit close contact and experience with several humans so that the few may in fact impact his 'current' decision, one he can easily alter at a later date. His awesome power will remain at the ready.The inclusion of the actual day the Earth stands still seemed ill placed and gratuitous though totally reminiscent of the original version. All machines, electric, time etc. stopped while Michael Rene prevented related deaths and destruction.All in all I enjoyed the IMAX viewing despite the movies obvious short comings.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

In this remake, we end up with more questions and holes in logic, than we have answers. ""We have come to save the Earth"" but in order to do so we have to destroy it??? And what role in this alien species did Reeves play. Was he a leader, a messenger or just an exterminator? It was never clear. Yet he somehow had the power and authority to stop the indiscriminate destruction. I also didn't like the kid's role. He was a brat all the way through, yet he was a focal point.

The acting is wooden and unremarkable.And that kid was TOTALLY out of place in this movie. It's painfully obvious that he's only there because his father is Will Smith.Keanu Reeves's alien is a bit lame, but he (the actor) was doing his best. Didn't pull it off, unfortunately. I don't think ANYONE could pull off such a poorly-written character.The story is not explained properly. An arc? What the...? I didn't quite understand the concept, and, most importantly, - why did the extraterrestrials back off so easily?What the hell was their big plan anyway? For such a (supposedly) advanced race -- to send one guy to Earth, so he can visit local swamps and stalk some broad and her kid -- is a bit unrealistic.Klaatu the alien was just too primitive... for an alien. More susceptible to cheesy bullshit than your regular human; how is THAT possible? And he keeps following that chick around begging her for a lift! Puh-lease!Where was he from again? Planet Dumb? And why exactly did Klaatu change his mind? He kept saying ""I don't know how to stop it"", ""I don't know if we can give you a chance"", etc., yet you never get to find out who's ""we"", and it's not clear who makes the decisions. The big guy was not explained properly, either.Let me understand this correctly... So the aliens travelled millions of light years to reach Plant Earth, and have made some elaborate invasion plans, but their rep sees a chick/kid cry and they suddenly decide to back off and go home? Are you kidding? The characters were dull, passive, and unrealistic. The only plausible performance was by the maths guy, and his screen time is less than a minute! It could've been a better movie, but their half-arsed approach to script-writing ruined it all.

172,robotbling,Pointless and annoying,2,12 December 2011,"(www.plasticpals.com) A classic sci-fi movie with strong anti-war themes made during the Cold War, updated for our own troubled times. Just replace the threat of all-out nuclear war with climate change, ocean acidification, rainforest deforestation, and other depressing problems looming just around the corner. Throw Keanu Reeves and Jennifer Connelly into the mix and what could possibly go wrong? A lot, apparently. I've never seen the original but I'm familiar enough with it. On paper, it seems like a great opportunity for a remake. But that's only if made to the high standards of say, Children of Men or Moon (the last truly intelligent and well executed sci-fi films that come to mind). To say this movie falls short of its potential is a huge understatement.Klaatu (adequately performed by Keanu Reeves) has arrived on Earth in a hurricane-filled vessel that looks like the ultima spell from Final Fantasy 8, only cooler. He's come to save the planet from its irresponsible caretakers (i.e. mankind). He's brought along his robotic pal GORT, who can only be described as a massive failure of special effects. Have you seen Pepsi Man? He's more realistic than GORT.Not only does GORT look super fake, but he doesn't liquidate the army's guns and tanks as in the original; instead he just emits a high pitched noise which paralyzes the soldiers. Did they run out of money? That's not to say GORT isn't cool. His body dissolves into nanomachines that look and behave like locusts on steroids, decimating anything they come into contact with on the molecular level. These sequences are actually really well done. Unfortunately, GORT is criminally underused.TDTESS-001On the run from the US military thanks to the sympathetic Dr.Benson (Connelly), Klaatu hooks up with an old friend from college at a McDonald's who has been living on Earth for a human lifetime and has come to love and understand humanity. I'm sorry, but are we honestly supposed to believe that a being of such higher intelligence that it can transplant its mind into another body for fun would spend a lifetime on Earth? If I could fly around the galaxy in my decked-out tempest sphere, exploring life-sustaining planets, I certainly wouldn't stop for the backwoods of New Jersey.Then there's Connelly's annoying step-son played by Will Smith's kid, who tags along and generally ruins every scene he is in. Like father like son. He's supposed to be an annoying brat so I guess I can't knock him for being just that. Anyway, suffice to say that by the end of the film we don't believe in Klaatu's change of heart towards humanity after witnessing the loving bond between stepmother and stepson. The movie ends so abruptly, and with such an underwhelming cathartic moment, that I was left stunned by its ineptitude. Luckily the movie runs only 1h44mins so if you want to subject yourself to it, it doesn't last very long. Probably better to hunt down the original, instead.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

176,Panterken,"Unaccomplished remake, a waste of Connely's talent and time.",4,12 December 2008,"Jennifer Connely, Keanu Reeves and young Jaden Smith (son of Will) head up the cast for this remake of the 1951 sci-fi classic where an extra-terrestrial robot visits Earth to turn the human race away from their own annihilation, warning them that the continuation of their warfare will instigate it. Much like other highly applauded films inspired by politics ('The Manchurian Candidate' for instance) the relevancy and strong message procure half the artistic value. Back then, the crisis was named Cold War. Now, it's called Global Warming.Unlike 'The Manchurian Candidate's' remake, this one doesn't work very well. If I say 'The War of The Worlds' by Spielberg outclasses TDWESS, some alarm bells should be ringing. While Connely occasionally lifts up the level, the internal logic of the story annoys. The fact that Klaatu only reveals it's true purpose (saving 'earth' from mankind) late in the movie can only stem from shortage of plot. Which makes the abrupt and unfulfilling ending even more bizarre and laughable. On one hand you have enough time to stretch Klaatu and Connely's character's interactions with an unnecessary road trip, on the other hand the storyline's ending is sloppy. The last scenes are supposed to be the most engrossing but left us only shrugging our shoulders. Other elements that should have everyone scratching their heads...an underpass is hardly enough protection against a storm of death. It doesn't help either that the supposed strong suit (and the only praise I read about it as of yet), the CGI makes the robot a rather laughable stick figure instead of a terrifying, indestructible alien.Countering those major flaws are a masterfully acted cameo by John Cleese as a Nobelprize winning scientist and the occasionally conveying all the world's worries, eyes of Jennifer Connely.

179,JPfanatic93,The way not to make the Earth stand still,5,4 January 2014,"The thing about remakes is they need to retell a story of old (or at least apply its general concepts) while giving it meaning that reflects contemporary society, instead of carbon-copying the meaning of their original counterpart to little avail in a changed world. In that regard, the remake of the Sci-Fi classic The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) is spot-on, replacing a warning against the dangers of nuclear weapons for an ecological message against man's carelessness where the health of the world's environment, and thus his own, is concerned. In all other respects, this new The Day the Earth Stood Still feels like a redundant exercise in how not to redo a well remembered movie.Like its predecessor from the Fifties, the film revolves around an extraterrestrial visitor, with a giant robot in tow, who is met with hostility and fear on our planet. Darker and grittier than the original, there is good cause to treat the stranger (an aptly emotionless (as always) Keanu Reeves) with aggressive caution, as he's not here delivering an ultimatum telling us to change our ways for the better, but has instead come to eradicate the human infestation from the face of the galaxy in an attempt to save all other life forms spawned by Mother Earth. Life, he says, is rare in the vast limitless of space and therefore a precious thing, but life endangering all other life must be swiftly dealt with: the ends clearly justify the means. Arriving in a sphere (as opposed to a saucer, like before) the alien called Klaatu has come not as a Christ figure like in the original film, but as an Anti-Christ, hellbent on unleashing his own weapon of mass destruction upon our not so innocent world. Said weapon proves to be his artificial companion Gort, who appears to be a metallic giant in humanoid shape, but actually consists of huge numbers of nanites capable of devouring everything they come into contact with. Thankfully humanity has its on secret weapons to combat Klaatu's convictions, namely a smart and strong female scientist (played by Jennifer Connelly) who manages to dissuade the alien from his destructive plans, backed up by the effective reasoning of an aged professor (John Cleese) who morally convinces him humanity must be allowed to make its own choices in the natural process of its evolution. Even though Klaatu's frozen heart is thawed and his role is turned around a full 180 degrees so Keanu can once again play the Messiah (e.g., The Matrix trilogy and Constantine), his original point is amply illustrated as the military tampers with his devices in a botched attempt to destroy them, only unleashing their horrors as nanites swarm the land and the FX department is given the opportunity to go all-out so as to obscure the fact this version of The Day the Earth Stood Still hardly proves as emotionally compelling as its forebear did.Aside from an update in themes and special effects, this remake offers little improvement over its predecessor. Religious overtones are obviously still to be found: aside from Klaatu's messianistic role, there is the notion of 'space arks' for example, small spheres evacuating all animal species off-world before being engulfed by a sea of nanites. The movie walks a fine line between being too obvious and too subtle, but the representation of religion is the least of its problems. This new The Day the Earth Stood Still has a hard time convincing the spectator that an alien intelligence can so easily be persuaded to alter its agenda, which from the start felt so ruthlessly unalterable thanks to Reeves' emotionless portrayal. What's worse, his turnaround is accomplished through interaction with the scientist and her kid, a terribly obnoxious and ungrateful little brat (Jaden Smith, of course), the latter more often given the audience the impression Klaatu was right from the start and humanity really is a plague better wiped out for the universe's sake, than making it easy for us to accept the otherworldly being is starting to appreciate contact with mankind and suddenly considers humans worth saving after all. The talents of both Connelly and Cleese remain underused in favor of this irritating child character, while it's they who deliver the truly valid arguments as to why humanity is just not so black and white as Klaatu feared. Meanwhile, being a big winter release, the current The Day the Earth Stood Still all too eagerly uses the tools at its disposal thank to the wonders of digital technology by adding many a bombastic scene of computer generated imagery fighting soldiers, reducing the film to the level of the average type of big FX driven action flick, instead of ending up as a smart and sensible science fiction drama like the far superior 1951 incarnation. Nowhere does this film feature either the intellectual impact or the trend setting production design the original was blessed with. Instead, its eco-message is delivered in a bland and forgetful new groove, the impression the film leaves as tiny as the nanites it showcases.A retooling of the original film where the phrase 'nuclear weapons' would simply have been substituted with 'global pollution' would probably have made for a more agreeable and certainly cheaper way to update that film for today's public, as the 2008 version of The Day the Earth Stood Still adequately illustrates that changing the message to fit the times and throwing huge sums of money at the project to give it that slick blockbuster feel while ignoring the character aspects doesn't make for a good film, let alone for an effective means to convince the audience of the value of the themes addressed.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

It's a typical Alien comes to earth, stupid earth people shoot alien, alien almost destroys the world, changes mind, end of movie.The only kewl looking thing in the entire movie was the giant cylon looking robot. But they barely used it.The soundtrack was typical Hollywood, ""attempting to make an epic film here"" using lots of classical music.Nothing really big seemed to happen until the last few minutes of the movie and even that was unimpressive.Felt like I wasted my time.

181,frankenbenz,Unbearable...,3,3 January 2009,"http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/I was lured to the cinema this week, hungering for a big blockbuster on the biggest screen in town. Unfortunately my choice was The Day the Earth Stood Still. When the movie opens in the freezing arctic, puffs of steam coming out of their actor's mouth are noticeably absent. So much for realism. Sadly, the director wants to convince you this movie is actually set in the real world and he goes to great lengths to prove so...trouble is, he's a hack and his efforts are strained, pathetically obvious and utterly unconvincing.You'd think this film had the budget of a viral video considering how bad all the CG helicopters look. The flight scenes in Clint Eastwood's Firefox look magnificent in comparison. As the action starts to ramp up, the horribly predictable dialogue becomes insufferable, incredibly fast. Throw in Will Smith's kid who can't act and his Sideshow Bob hair-do, and your brain starts to fracture into mind mincing shards. I liked the Exorcism of Emily Rose, but because of this worthless attempt to remake a masterpiece, I'll forever consider the name Scott Derrickson a curse to movie-making. Walkout time: 22:00.

182,tkarlmann,"So much hope and promise, but ...",5,23 December 2018,"For anyone who likes this film, all I can say is you are not old enough to appreciate the Original done in 1951. I think Kathy Bates and Jennifer Connely did a fine job in their roles. But to try and compare Keanau Reeves to Michael Rennie (of the Original) is simply not fair -- Rennie can out-act Reeves any day. In the Original, we see Klaatu acting humanely on an interpersonal level; in the new he acts ... well just like Neu. This films lacks HEART. In the Original Klaatu was to learn about mankind; in this new film, new-Klaatu has already made his mind up.
Gort -- THE most fabulous robot alien ever created (well, except for Robbie!) -- was FANTASTIC in the Original and showed some 'compassion', but in this film new-Gort turns into bugs that eat diamond drill bits? Not what I was hoping to see; but new-Gort in his original form WAS impressive.
Kathy Bates was impressive as the Ultimate Bureaucrat.
I found the boy in the new film annoying; in the Original, I felt I could identify with the character.
In the Original you wanted Klaatu to be your friend, uncle, husband or father; in this film you just wanted him gone.
I gave the film 5 stars for all the nods to the Original -- like the Blackboard scene, but even there they left out the most impressive line: ""Does this work? Well, it works well enough to get me from planet to planet."". Plus there was no intro into finding ""the smartest man around"". There was no discovery that Klaatu was the Spaceman theme. There was no ""Klaatu Barada Nikto"" to direct Gort! Go see the Original from 1951!!!

Plants and animals and landscapes don't have legal standing! In other words, they have no rights! In the Day the Earth Stood Still, the tables are turned on the human race by an extremely advanced, extraterrestrial aliens and then we have NO RIGHTS! Now we get to see how it feels when our species is considered to be like a virus needing to be destroyed in order to save all other life on the planet. Based on the poor reviews this film received by most people, I guess the storyline has hit a nerve! Good!I want to thank Hollywood for having the courage to make such a deep film in a world so crass and shallow!

Actually, in this movie, it is not about a threat to the planet, just to its dominant species, us. Humanity is destroying the Earth and intelligent life in other parts of the universe want to save the planet (because planets suitable for life are scarce) by eliminating the human species.There are some of the stupid alien encounter clichés, notably repeated attempts to use conventional weapons against the alien even after it is clear the alien can nullify all such attempts. The conventional weapons include modern armed drones but also relatively old technology such as Sidewinder missiles. There is also no discussion of trying nuclear weapons.Nevertheless I liked the special effects, the acting, and the message that the Earth is at an environmental precipice.I see where many critics and commenters didn't like Keanu Reeves performance. I disagree. I thought the manner in which he portrayed the alien Kaatu as almost but not quite emotionless was very appropriate.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
187,eastbergholt2002,Complete Mess,3,9 May 2009,"I loved Robert Wise's original film, so this remake was a big disappointment. This is the type of movie that gives Hollywood blockbusters a bad name. The filmmakers have taken a well loved film and produced a travesty. For some reason the idiots behind the film decided that the story could be improved upon, unfortunately their changes make little sense. When a spaceship lands in Central Park, an alien messenger called Klaatu (Keanu Reeves)disembarks. The rest of the universe is worried about the Earth's environmental record and Klaatu has been sent to tell us to clean up our act. He is shot and captured. Kathy Bates plays a Defense Secretary in the Cheney/Rumsfeld mold. She decides that the aliens need a demonstration of America's military prowess and decides to play hardball. The U.S. government wants to keep the alien locked up and his identity a secret. This does not go down well with Klaatu, who concludes that further discussion with the U.S. government is a waste of time and decides to exterminate mankind.Jennifer Connelly plays a Princeton professor and government science expert who befriends Klaatu. In the original film Michael Rennie moved around DC and is gradually won over by Patricia Neal and the other ordinary people he meets. In this film he is shackled to Connelly and her young son. Reeves exhibits none of Rennie's easy charm and looks dazed and confused most of the time. The child playing Connelly's son overacts and is an annoying distraction. At the end of the film, Klaatu leaves the Earth telling only Connelly and Professor Barnhardt (John Cleese) about his mission, there is no speech to mankind and the film fizzles out. The movie does have impressive special effects and perhaps if they had given the film the benefit of modern film technology and an updated look this remake may have been justified. Unfortunately an American classic has been vandalized, and you have to wonder what they were thinking.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
188,tubby1,A bit of style but sadly insufficient substance,6,12 July 2009,"The Day the Earth Stood Still is far too commercial to give sufficient attention to its predominant themes of human 'responsibility' and respectability'. The film goes for big bangs and special effects to maintain what is rather a flimsy finale.The casting of Keanu Reeves is spot-on, he is perfect as the other-worldly being able to perform much like his Neo in the Matrix. The special effects at times were highly impressive but then again it did struggle in periods. The film does have an immediacy and a tension but it is not maintained nor provided in an intelligent way. The side characters (Kathy Bates as secretary of defence and Robert Knepper the military commander) act rather worryingly with little insight or intellect for those of such positions, again a commercial necessity it seems for the film rather than anything else. The script frustratingly is rather illogical and does this it seems to keep the action and suspense to a certain level. The biggest flaw and essentially its downfall is the end, which I won't spoil. In the rush of the film it does not give sufficient time to elaborate on the outcome or indeed make it sensical.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

190,tomrito,The day humanity was almost eaten.,7,13 December 2008,"Saying that this film should not be judged against the original is just absurd. If you have seen the first film, how could you not compare the two? This new film does have a lot going for it; its updated environmental message, great special effects, good acting, and the military technology is very state-of-the art. It even starts out to be a great science fiction movie; the beginning is both exciting and suspenseful. However, once Klaatu escapes, the excitement starts to fade and is never really re-captured throughout the rest of the film. Here is where a comparison between the two films becomes relevant. In the original, Klaatu is anonymous, he takes a room at a boarding house and while trying to meet a representation of the world scientists, he starts a process of observation and familiarization with the human race. It is through these experiences that he concludes we should be given another chance. In the new version it is not very clear what is really going on. It might be bad direction or it could be poor editing, but we are given a bunch of seemingly unrelated events before an abrupt ending. In the first film, Klaatu makes the earth stand still to prove his omnipotent abilities without aggression. In the new film there is no reason.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

The first minutes are interesting but once Klaatu gets to escape the movie decreases in its quality and in being entertaining, the final part sucks. I think it was a mistake having put the giant robot that protected the sphere (ship) like in the original movie, I expected to see something different about that point in relation with the original one.On the other hand I liked the performances of the beautiful Jennifer Connelly and the little Jaden Smith, specially the scene they share at the cemetery.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

You know the story.Alien comes to earth to warn us that we are destroying our planet-and the rest of the solar system. After he is wounded, he escapes and blends into the population. Reeves plays Klaatu as an unemotional, feelingless soul, like a Mr. Spock. Jennifer Conneley-a fine actress is totally wasted in the Patricia Neal role. She is given nothing to do, and it shows.This time around, the saucer lands in NY's Central park.As in the original, the visitor befriends her son, but this time out the kid is just an obnoxious brat.Also on hand is Gort the robot. Looking more like a kid's toy than a robot who can destroy the world, he shows absolutely no sense of menace. And since Klaatu must prove his powers, he does just what Michael Rennie did back in 1951, but, of course, it is only CGI effects. The damn shame of this remake is that it gives nothing new. It only updates the story{and FX } to the current time. It is trite, predictable, pretentious, yet for some reason it moves pretty well. Hollywood and film-making are in serious trouble when a genuine classic is remade.

194,moviemaniac008,Pretty good sci-fiction film,9,14 December 2008,"I went to see this movie yesterday. I was sort of expecting (judging by the trailers), an explosive movie with action all along. Well let me get this straight, people: THIS IS NOT AN EXPLOSIVE MOVIE! So there you are warned. Many people who came out of the theater at the end of the film seemed bummed out. I even heard two boys say to each other that the movie was garbage because it lacked action. So yeah, there is a lot of action in the trailers, but that's about all what there is really in the movie, if not, slightly more. But this film focuses more on Klaatu (Keanau Reeves, who is excellent in this movie) and his personality. He is an alien that came to Earth to exterminate the human race. Even though some of his actions are totally out of this world, he looks human, and towards the end of this film he has a change of mind, which proves that he has a heart. So in other words, he kind of is like a human.I usually include a small plot summary of the movie in my reviews but in this case, I sort of did it already in the first paragraphs. Keanau Reeves is excellent, and so is Jennifer Connelley, but the one that actually stole the show (according to me), is the young Jaden Smith, which we saw in The Pursuit of Happiness in 2006, in which he played with his impressive dad, the legendary Will Smith. Jaden, if you read this, YOU ROCK, BOY! The special effects also were excellent, and that's all what I have to say really.So in other words, with an entertaining bunch of actors and great visual effects, The Day the Earth Stood Still is a very good movie. That is, if you don't expect it to be explosions and gunfires all along.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Most actors are character actors and as long as they play their part, then the film usually does well.Keanu Reeves. Black Suit, Black Tie, White Button Up Shirt. Hmmmm. Constantine, The Matrix, Johnny Pneumatic, etc.Jennifer Connely. Cold, yet passionate, scientist/Dr, John Cleese. He's old. He has class, and there that is.The movie. One politically correct, product placement plug after another. Yes, we get it, Microsoft rules the world. Yes, drive a hybrid save the planet. Yes, humans are a infectious disease that is killing the Earth and the only thing that can save us are the benevolent space creatures who literally say ""change or die"" and bring peace at the end of the threat of annihilation.Sure, the first one more or less said the same thing to a degree, you have the choice to be ""like us, peaceful and without want, or face genocide"".And apparently no one has ever thought to ask the peace loving aliens how many times they bring up that ultimatum because they always seem a little to comfortable with that idea.Never the less, what this lacked in intelligence and story telling it of course made up for flashy effects, and millions of dollars of computer animation.In all honesty it isn't even fair to that this is a re-make as it is nearly an entirely different movie. Sure there was ""Klatuu"", and ""Gort"", and thematically it was loosely the same, but the premise was different, as was the resolution.No one really learned or benefited from the destruction caused by Gort, and the majority of destruction wasn't even caused by him as it was caused by the stupid, puny humans who still thought that they were in control, and that when all else fails, blow the problem to hell. Sure maybe some did learn, but considering that there were still workers in a car factory building cars (no doubt more hybrids) at the end of the film while the ensuing crisis was going on, it really made it hard to believe that humanity at large really cared at all.And while the original was dealing with the issue of the Cold War as the cause of the damnation of Earth, it at least took the time to point out that the ""war"" was absurd and that the Russians were in just as much a situation as we were.Honestly anymore, unless a movie comes out that is an original idea as opposed to a remake, I am not even going to bother anymore.Organizations like the MPAA are running around trying to place blame on why movie sales are down. They would have us believe that those ""evil P2P file sharers"" are the cause for the low ticket sales.They would also probably have us believe that it is the recession too.But the truth of the matter is that the movies coming out are simply crap. The story lines are all glitz and no substance, and whenever a movie does come out that is supposed to be ""intelligent"" it usually ends in a depressing tragedy in order to get you to ""think"". There are no more heroes, just tortured characters who's choices are what separates them from good or evil.

I wish for the world to be saved or doomed by someone other than American Presidents and their bravery or stupidity. Just for the sake of diversity, no other reason! Other clichés: good scientists vs. evil governments, dumb generals stuck in MAD mode, ""love conquers all"", and so on- you gotta love this stuff. The idea of a superior alien civilization trying to put sense into the human race is pretty ridiculous. Just as stupid as putting an alien to a lie detector. Or having the said Alien meet another fellow alien in a McDonald's joint, speaking Chinese. The shameless McDonald's product placement is another stroke of moronic genius, and that scene will have anyone rolling on the floor laughing.The encounter between Klaatu and the Nobel laureate was, again, laugh- out-loud cliché. Klaatu listens to Bach and has a sudden revelation on human duality. The Alien and the Man seem to share a mathematical language, so they gaze at each other and feel a connection. We are not that different after all. How deeply touching! Now for the truly bad parts: the ungrateful, obnoxious little brat played by the child of a famous actor.

199,sinncross,More an ad than movie...,6,13 December 2008,"As an unknown force begins to rapidly make it's way to Earth, the United States government attempts to thwart the object with the help of various well established scientists, one such being Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly). With just over an hour to devise a plan the scientists come up empty handed and are forced to witness the destruction of Washington. Must to their surprise the unknown force slows down and settles on earth with little destruction and is seen in the form of a gigantic sphere. A humanoid figure going by the name Klaatu (Keanu Reeves) leaves the sphere and impresses upon Benson the imminent eradication of humankind.The opening of the film, set may years before the events which occur in the present time line, is meant to serve as a sort of teaser to the main story. However the opening is not engaging and lacks any form of mystery. The scene itself could have been shorter and better used in the middle arc of the film in the form of a flashback or explanation. This would have cut a few minutes off the run time as the film feels a little too long for almost no reason. As for the story itself, it is quite simplistic. Even with the global warming undertones the film presents there is little to engage audiences on an intellectual level. The story does have some noteworthy moments, such as when it is discovered as to the real reason for Klaatu visit Earth and his role in this plan. But far too little is developed and the film suffers for it. The ending is as well quite contrived and doesn't give the full impact of the environmentalist messages. As such the story feels washed out and more like an an attempt at holding a protest sign then actually going out and physically doing something about the problem at hand.On the acting front the film delivers a fairly decent effort. Reeve's character is essentially emotionless, and while Reeves himself is not the most talented actor it does feel harsh to say that he was aptly suited for the role when he has shown at times in his career his ability to act. That said, he was aptly suited for a being who could not feel, but merely decipher the world through sheer logic. This is a contrast Connelly's character who is dealing with some emotional situations, especially with the death of her husband. Connelly performs well enough but due to script problems it becomes difficult for her to make the character more believable. The last of the in actors is Jaden Smith. Jaden's character is in a nutshell, a brat. But a brat who does undergo development. Jaden does a pretty decent job with the role but like the previous two actors, the script really falters in allowing the audience to have a connection with the character. Ultimately the characters feel more like tools just to get some theme across. That theme is pretty blatant and materialises into nothing audiences haven't been exposed to before. As such, the plan to replace character involvement for another aspect of the film does falls flat.From a technical aspect the music does work though it is nothing special. It is perhaps not eerie enough when it should be eerie, or jolted enough in scenes of panic and action. However the CG elements range from good to mediocre. When special effects are added the CG can be quite appealing to the eye, such as the sphere which is used for transportation by the aliens. But the countless CG models used on military helicopters, mainly, is quite bland. While it is not evidently noticeable, praise must be given to the 3D modelers for hiding the bad CG behind an array of smoke and/ or darkness so that the models look more adequate then they ought to. at said, the CG used towards the end of the film is consistently good.There is no sex, minimal side nudity with is not at the least graphic, minimal language and minimal violence, which involves mainly military procedures.The Day the Earth Stood Still is a film which falters because of its direction. Yes there are factors in the film which don't work but these mainly occur because of the director's approach to the subject matter. The script is not fueled enough to give life to the characters and this becomes an evident difficulty for the actors. The story is far too linear focusing more on tying to masquerade environmentalist messages, instead of trying to intertwine these messages into a story with some substance. Even the CG is a touch-and-go sort of situation. That said the film is not a total failure: it has it's moments. The special effects do look nice at times, and the script does up itself at the rare moment, but it all could have been so much more.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

201,cyclone259,...This will take some getting used to...,6,13 April 2009,"I'm a huge fan of the 1951 production and when I heard that there was yet another remake of one of my sci-fi favorites I cringed for numerous reasons.First, I thoroughly enjoyed Keanu Reeves in the (original Matrix) and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. He's a decent actor (not great, but OK) and as long as he doesn't have to emote he is able to hold his own. On that note, Klaatu was a role he could handle. He has nowhere near the skill of Michael Rennie in the original version, but he's passable (that's being gracious).It's hard to do an honest comparison of the two films side-by-side, because each has their own 'spin' on the storyline. Each rendition is also a direct reflection on the time in which they were released. I do think there were some nods to the original, but some of the actors seemed out-of-place, namely Jaden Smith and John Cleese. I got the whole back story as to why Jaden's character Jacob was with Jennifer Connelly, but I really didn't care. In fact I didn't care for much of the cast and felt they were mostly throwaway.As a sci-fi purist I should really loathe this movie, but I didn't watch it with high expectations (plus I paid $1 to rent it) and on that level it works. As I mentioned before, I don't think this film had much in the way of character development, but the CGI was good and the twist to the storyline was different. If you just watch it as one of those 'rainy day' movies (it was raining when I viewed it), it works.

This movie had a certain appeal to it it was very dark and intense, it was smart and intimidating.It was all around a great film.This remake of the 1951 Sci-Fi political inept classic is nothing short of brilliant. It brings so much more to the table than the original and it does great with all the new technology and upgrades in the story and plot. The one thing I did find that I didn't like was the lack of background into Klaatu's past that was the only thing I found I did not like. This 2008 update brings a certain feeling of moral sense about what is going on in the environment it's a story that tells us that if we don't change our ways we'll all die. Which is partly true but what really drew me to this film was it's dark nature, I mean one alien has come to our planet to deiced our fate by judging whether or not we are fit to continue to live on this planet.It's a great ""change your ways"" story that seems to leap off the screen and drag you into it's world of chaos and destruction. But ti did have a righteous pull to it as well I mean it was trying to tell us that we've got this one world and this one life and we need to cherish as best we can and to mean that made it great to watch.Keanu Reeves turns in an amazing performance as the otherworldly hit man/ judge and he brings a dark forbearing and boding sense of justice and style to a very old character, Jennifer Connelly does well here as the widowed scientist Helen Benson. Jon Hamm showcase's he's got some good acting chops outside his Mad Men role and Kathy Bates is fantastic as always. The only weak link in the group was Jaden Smith, son of Two time Oscar nominee Will Smith, He gave such an annoying and bad performance that it made everyone else look bad he was bratty and crass and didn't really show off any real talent at all. But besides that the cast held up pretty well and did good with the material that they were given.This film is what you would call a dedication to the environment, an Eco friendly Science Fiction movie( which is very rare.) and that gives it more of an appeal to Eco fanatic's and regular moviegoer's. But what really takes it outside the conventional Sci-Fi thriller genre is it's force and undeniable strength, it's will is unstoppable and it's grand and almost detailed way of telling the story makes it all the more powerful and amazing.The Day the Earth Stood Still is a force to be reckoned with it's powerful, ingenious and oh so entertaining to the point that the passage of time is meaningless. All in all T.D.T.E.S.S. is an enthralling and mesmerizing Sci-Fi adventure to see it's wild fun and the fans of the original will love it if they give it a chance. This film rocked my world and I know if your forgiving it will rock yours as well. The day the earth stood still is an event you don't want to miss.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
203,midge56,Terrible characters with worse dialogue,6,27 July 2017,"I love scifi & despite what some overinflated critic hack might claim; there is no lack of demand for this genre. There is a lack of original stories and competent directors.I was astonished to read 650 of 700 reviews posted here all agreed about the bratty kid character who ruined every scene of the movie for all of us. (Will Smith, this is what happens when a child has no punishment for bad behavior. They don't learn without sufficient consequences.)I blame the screenwriter & director for the terrible characters they developed with even worse dialogue. The worst character was the bratty kid. He was simply awful. This was not an ethnic issue. This was an attitude issue. A smart mouthed brat constantly back talking & causing nothing but trouble & fails to behave. He does exactly the opposite of what he has been told. Nor does his caretaker pay attention to his behavior as she foolishly brings him along with her instead of leaving him with a neighbor or relative as she did at the beginning. What's worse, the kids role & dialogue controlled the entire movie. The audience felt he needed a good paddling.The kid literally ruined the movie for everyone. He was nothing like the wide-eyed boy with curiosity & amazement as in the original movie.Dr Helen was no better. Neither her demeanor nor her dialogue were believable in her role. She acted more like some inexperienced teen than a respectable doctor. Arguing with the gov't before learning their purpose for her expertise. Her inability to control or monitor the brat was evident of this characters lack of experience & maturity.Then we have a Sec of defense who goes out of her way to provoke the alien into a conflict. No diplomatic skills there. She also does everything possible to make the alien hate us. She was clearly overbearing.Keanu Reeves made a great alien but his character in the script never bothered to discuss his purpose before the destruction was unleashed. Nor did they provide a second chance warning. Or consideration for those who were innocent. The first movie at least received a warning to all nations. I didn't know why some reviewers kept referring to ""canoe"". I now realize it was a nickname used for Keanu by those who can't properly pronounce KEY AW NEW.Then we had an incomplete ending & unsure of the actual ramifications. Permanently without power or temp? What about medical technology? This portion of the film was incomplete. Also, with the alien leaving without explanation or threats, the gov'ts would continue their bad management. Nothing would be accomplished without a terrifying warning of what they needed to do to avoid utter destruction.I have to agree with those who complain about the constant use of NYC or Washington DC as focal point locations for these films. There are plenty of other cities. But I do realize that those 2 cities are also focal points for the UN and the US gov't. However, I always wondered why Paris was the locale for so many peace treaties (Rev war, War of 1812, Viet Nam war, etc).Those rednecks (who are always blaming leftists in their comments) are the ones responsible for global environmental destruction, wars, violence, pollution & corrupt gov't. Shouldn't you be out killing some endangered animal instead of watching scifi you clearly don't understand? Or are they those who are Incarcerated without the ability to change the channel.The special effects were interesting but nothing could overcome such horrible dialogue & weak characters. We needed the wisdom & calm demeanor of Morgan Freeman in this film.The movie is watchable but the kid will still ruin it for everyone.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
204,JRmf,Why is it so hard to do a remake that truly satisfies?,8,28 December 2008,"Looking at two other recent remakes, ""War of the Worlds"" and ""The Time Machine"": In WOTW, I was looking forward to a good old Earth-vs-the-aliens punch-up (somewhat akin to ID4, but with historical overtones), instead was given deep insights into crowd psychology when all the chips are down and humanity's survival is at stake. In TTM, I enjoyed the first half, especially the turn of the 19th century scenes, but the 2nd half in Morlock land left me cold - the original features white child-like folks in a garden of Eden, the remake had brown-skinned folk living on the sides of cliffs or in jungle. So maybe it is just hard to do a remake of a prior success - it has to be different (but maybe not too different) but must impress to the same or an even greater extent.I'd have to agree with the plethora of comments already made which say TDTESS08 was ""unsatisfying"", ""failed to reach potential"", ""superficial"" etc. The frenetic pace and short runtime with very little spent on serious (as opposed to token) reflection or deeper meaning made me think that the filmmakers were playing to goldfish, and dared not linger too long on anything of substance less the concentration be lost. Of course with $80M at stake they couldn't really afford a flop. Mere spectacle is much harder to argue with, and is much easier to generate than good storytelling or characters we feel for.TDTESS08's visuals are spectacular and can't fail to impress. I don't remember the music score at all (and I am a keen music-lover) so it must have been unimpressive. And there are some interesting ideas, most notably the nanobot cloud/end-of-the world executor but also the spheres of light which collect Earth specimens for preservation.But Klaatu's first contact with earthlings is inexplicable. He has come to pass judgment on a warlike race, he knows they are prone to violence, he can see they are armed to the teeth and fearful, DOH.. so wouldn't some body armor or a force shield or two have been appropriate? How come a being with all that power is so easily taken down? Or he could have sent GORT out first...Apparently the powers that Klaatu represents have been studying Earth and its inhabitants for a long period, so wouldn't that include sociology, psychology, the arts in general? Humanity IS an incredible mess but alongside the horror and terror it contains much that is good and beautiful. Even Mr Wu admits as much. So the decision to stop the execution of the world merely because of a the sight of a mother and child's embrace and tears seems unconvincing. Holy cow dude, you are talking about genocide on a global scale here, haven't you thought this thing through..John Cleese (of all people) as Professor and Man's Advocate seemed an odd casting choice. Klaatu's failure to address something like the UN, or maybe at least a group of Nobel prizewinners, seemed a serious omission. Kathy Bates I find it hard to forget as the psychopathic fan in Misery who cheerfully placed a large wooden plank between Tim Robbins ankles then proceeded to use a sledgehammer to ""hobble"" him (break his ankles).In the original TDTESS, the stopping of all technology (except, miraculously, for hospitals, planes in flight etc.) was a central part of the story. This version skipped that key bit and should be titled ""The Day The Earth Stood Still.. Forever"", as that is the implication. As Klaatu warned, were he able to stop the nanobots, there would still be a penalty. Indeed, instantly disabling electricity globally on a permanent basis would save the planet from Man, but would cause incredible hardship and millions if not billions of deaths - but then, Man was seen as the problem, the planet's survival was foremost.For all the above, I think any SF freak would still want this one in their collection. It's OK, but could have been so much more. 6/10",The Day the Earth Stood Still
205,wayno-6,Save your Money,1,13 December 2008,"Where to start? Well there is no resemblance between this remake of the classic.The plot has been re-worked, and except for minor things, this in no way resembles the original movie.I thought Keanu Reeves was marginal in ""The Matrix"" - but this removed all doubt. Keanu Reeves again plays a ""contact lens"" depth of character. Very little emotion, almost a sterile performance. He was so monotone, that I had to fight staying awake through the movie. His droning voice, nearly bored me to death.Plot is pretty predictable, but there is no ""benevolence"" really shown by the character.The thin acting, did not hide the fact, that the plot also was thread-bare.The special effects were good, but not superior. They did NOT really enhance my viewing pleasure, oh make me go ""OOOH! AHHH!"" It was, more like ""Blah!"" I'll be generous and give this movie 1.5 reels out of 5.Definitely NOT worth the bucks!

( Expletives reluctantly omitted),3,14 December 2008,"OK, this is going to be short and off the top of my head because this film doesn't deserve a lengthy or even thought out review. ""When The Earth Stood Still"" needs a warning label. It should read something like ""Caution: if your aesthetic sensibilities require films to have cohesion, sensible plot points, decent dialog and adequate if not captivating performances, then please avoid this film! The producers will not be held accountable for any disappointment you may incur!"" Unfortunately I can't sue to get my money back. And they had names, man! Keanu! Jennifer! (Who still looks quite superb, thank you. Kudos Ms Connolly.) I mean seriously, Kathy Bates? Was that really Kathy-Misery/At Play In the Fields Of The Lord-Bates in that mannequin performance, reciting her lines as if reading from the cafeteria menu? And the incessant commercials! Windows. MacDonalds. And they didn't even try to weave the product placement into the story. Some people may try to be nice and point out that the acting wasn't really all that bad, and that it was really the fault of the bland script... or they may suggest that the message of the film outweighs its poor execution. Not! Look, I wasn't expecting revolutionary film-making. Just some nice big budget CG escapism. I like candy every now and then. But couldn't t they have even tried to make a decent piece of work? Is mediocrity now a requirement?

207,Beachbum2018,Ruined by a kid that simply can't act,4,20 March 2021,"Thought I'd reviewed this movie earlier, but no, even though I've seen it several times on TV now.
Bottom line this simplistic but quite good remake of the original is simply destroyed by Jadon Smith, one of the worst castings ever! And I'm not alone, many other reviews say similar, so what is it about Master Smith that causes this adverse reaction.
Let's be honest this is one time being the offspring of a famous actor doesn't guarantee the acting line continues on to the same destiny.... Jadon should stop trying to act and just do something else! Any movie he's been in creates the same adverse reaction, viewers just can't relate to him and even worse actually dislike him in any role, which is a pretty bad start - if the audience dislike you why would they pay money to watch you! Totally defeats the purpose of being an actor before you start!
Possibly Jadon is a nice kid / person in real life, but acting is something he should just forget about!

It's simple, it's shocking. We, the humans, are stupid enough (and it's the case by the way), and we will not listen to anybody who comes to our earth, we will probably kill them before they even come. This movie send a great message for our earth... With all the technology, we are about to make this all happen, the end of our great world.

And i'm not saying, that i'm better than anyone else, but this is half-fiction, half reality.On the movie, great cast starring Keanu Reeves, Jennifer Connelly and Kathy Bates.

210,J_Trex,Al Gore should have played Klaatu,5,14 December 2008,"You watched this movie and wondered why they bothered? The cast was good, Jennifer Connelly was excellent as always, Keanu Reeves played the role (Klaatu) the way it was written, as did the rest of the cast, but the script was pretty awful. It seemed wooden and nothing flowed particularly well. The scenes didn't really make much sense. The movie began in 1928 with Keanu Reeve's character climbing a mountain in the Himalayas, he uncovers a UFO type object, touches it, is knocked out, wakes up with a strange scar on his hand, and then we flash forward to today, and Manhatten is about to be vaporized by an asteroid. Then the movie begins, but rest assured none of it seems very real, based mostly on the laughably bad dialog. This was an Ed Wood inspired stinker of a screenplay. The writers could have had some fun with the update from the 1950's original. I think it might have been interesting if the aliens had channeled Al Gore into the role of Klaatu. They could have gotten Darrel Hammond from SNL to play Al Gore and he could have threatened the Human race with destruction if they didn't abolish greenhouse gases and nuclear weapons. Now that would have been good.In any event, the performances were largely wasted on an incredibly weak script and incoherent plot. More's the pity, it could have been so much better.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
211,Red_Flag,The day that Fox stopped caring,4,10 December 2008,"Let's face it; 20th Century Fox haven't had a good year. They have bombed at the box office with the intensely drab ""The Happening"" and ""The X Files: I want to believe"" and here, there still not back on track. This is another example of great source material not done to justice. It's not as if I wanted to dislike this movie. I went in with reasonably high expectations most of which were not met. What doesn't work with this movie is the exact same problem I had with 2005's ""War of the Worlds"". It starts off wonderfully, keeping you on the edge of your seat for most of that first act. From the moment were allowed incite to what were dealing with the tension is dropped, and from that point on it feels like were all merely going through the motions.Reeves is wooden, but what do you expect. It's hard to complain when he fits the character so perfectly. Whether or not it was intentional his character benefits from his monotone vocals. Jennifer Connelly is outstanding once again bringing much needed emotion to a character that one paper could have been extremely on paper could have been extremely dispensable. We know she's better than this and I'm sure she knows this as well.Keanu Reeves tops this adaptation of the seminal 1951 sci-fi film The Day the Earth Stood Still with this 20th Century Fox production. Scott Derrickson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose) helms the story of an alien traveler, Klaatu (Reeves), who heads to Earth along with his bodyguard robot, Gort, to deliver a warning of planetary destruction if the people of the world fail to bring peace to their civilizations. Jennifer Connelly, Jon Hamm, and Kathy Bates co-star in the Ryne Douglas Pearson-penned film.What ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" really stumbles over is its writing. You can't help at some of the drab dialogue that's so daft even Jennifer can't pull it off. What's stunning is just how ensemble the cast is. John Cleese makes one of the most ridiculous cameos in film history and Kathy Bates presence is barely notices, he character has room to develop but it never does. One aspect I simply can't fault is the special effects, they shimmer with flair and originality and even at moments that you could see it going horribly wrong the effect specialist never flinch Creating a realist environment and a one that one several occasions may just leave you startled at how astounding the effects are. None of this however excuses the lazy execution of what is still considered a Sci-Fi classic. What I hope myself and many others will gain from this experience is that stunning source material doesn't confirm an adaptations success. This is the exact reason why I still have my doubts about ""The Watchmen"".Verdict: no matter how competently the effects are used, the movie suffers tremendously from a lazy second and third act. The acting is perfectly passable and the story still hasn't lost its charm but everything else feels stilted. The Day The Earth Stood Still may just be remembered as ""The Day The Earth Stopped Caring.""",The Day the Earth Stood Still
212,jery-tillotson-1,A Real Disaster Movie,1,17 December 2008,"The days when Hollywood once turned out such classics as the l951 THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, are long gone. When we go to the multi-plex today, we're treated to endless, lousy remakes of Asian horror flicks, endless sequels (i.e., Saw, Alien, Terminator, Halloween, etc.) that squeeze every drop of magic from the original until there's only a dried up rind. This remake of The Day the Earth Stood STill, is a perfect, sorry example of what passes for movie sci-fi/fantasy in the year 2008. While the l951 original still fascinates with its powerful acting, script, production and that fabulous Bernard Hermann's musical score, this new take features a shockingly inept cast and grade-Z special effects.We're treated to a zombie-like Keanu Reeves who shows the emotion of an oyster. His face and eyes never change expression. His voice sounds like a dead man. His fellow living corpse is Jennifer Connelly who acts as if she exists in a different universe with no connection to what's happening around her. Even worse, is the obnoxious, surly black kid, Jaden Smith (oh, yes, son of the mighty Will Smith) who is so repulsive you wish the giant robot Gort would zap him off the screen. It's as if the movie makers are so fanatically politically correct that they gave us a black child who is supposedly adopted by a white woman, Jennifer Connelly. They have no rapport, but then the child is so hostile, one can understand why. One of the key figures in the original was the young boy played by the wonderful child actor, Billy Gray. He was so genuinely sweet and likable that you really loved him. When he shows the alien the memorial graveside of countless dead military men and women, and then visited the Abraham Lincoln memorial, you were profoundly moved. When Jaden Smith does this in the remake, a glycyrine tear dribbles down his cheek ss he glares sullenly at the zombie-like Reaves. Wow, what a really down, hostile scene.There's no sense of impending disaster and when the day finally comes for the Earth to stand still, a swarm of badly executed CGI bugs destroy Yankee Stadium and then stop. Keanu Reeves has obviously discovered that mankind isn't all evil. That's because the black kid and his mother have persuaded him that there is still good in the human race. If only, there was some good among movie makers, the type of goodness that would persuade them to give us some original, scary movie magic--like Alien, The Thing, The Terminator, halloween, etc.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

I found it hard to believe that the alien actually GAVE us a second chance because of him.Keanu is the master of the expressionless look, perfect for an emotionless alien. I am being serious given the gravity of the situation.I was amused by how they portrayed our military. Our Sec. Of Defense, played by Kathy Bates, was bafflingly hostile to a very benign first contact when diplomacy would have been most useful and we were outmatched. But later when military force is justified, we use the same weapons that failed so miserably the first time. And this is after we move the jumbo robot to an isolated location. How about using one of our many tactical nukes? This would have actually worked because Keanu disables the robot bug swarm with an EMP and our nukes generate EMP's.So our military pisses off the aliens and then never uses our best weapon; great job guys :-)I closed my eyes and thought about this whenever the kid spoke.

They are all shown a slide show of an object that has set course for Manhattan which is a city of 8 million inhabitants which will end its destination in 78 minutes time.In something of an end of the world film, but in this film it's more like an alien invasion like from the film ""War of the Worlds"". Although this movie stars Keanu Reeves and Jennifer Connelly, what really makes this movie exciting are the special effects and graphics bringing you into the film and making you feel the old films from this remake from 1951 classic sci-fi film which probably doesn't compare to this movie to some people, but might be fun to check out anyways. When it comes to the end of the world you look deeper into things, it shows you how the character sort of runs from the disaster or how they figure out what is going on. In this film Connelly's character Benson is the head honcho as some people would call it to stop the aliens from destroying everything and starting anew. I'm not really sure what it is when I watch sci-fi, but it intrigues you so much probably because it is less predictable than a movie based off something that is realistic.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

WHY do they have to dumb down movies to the lowest common denominator? Are 5th graders the target audience? Why can't somebody make a decent sci-fi movie for reasonably intelligent adults? This movie disappoints in so many ways: 1) We don't get an alien spaceship just a totally awe-lacking sphere of spinning lights. 2) Instead of a charismatic alien like Michael Rennie, we get a robotic Keanu Reeves. 3)CGI is used to create a cartoonish robot Gort, instead of believable special effects. 4)Ridiculous ideas such as Secretary of State Kathy Bates calling the shots instead of the President 5)The aliens are capable of interstellar travel but their representative arrives flopping around like a fish out of water in a ""placenta spacesuit."" 6)An annoying little kid that would increase my desire to destroy the planet.I also laughed at the part where there is a plane full of GIs - Jennifer Connely, one of the hottest women on Earth, walks onboard and the GIs keep staring across the aisle at each other. HAHAHAHAHA! Finally, if an interstellar alien decided to remove humans from the planet, why would they send a representative? Just send the idiotic little metal bugs.

I used to go to the cinema at least once a week, sometimes even twice. I guess that was 10-15 years ago. Today my cinema visiting frequency has dropped to around 6 a year, and is likely going to drop even further. Why would I have to pay for dumb remakes that are literally so filled with commercials that in reality the cinema should be paying me to watch all that crap? I don't like McDonalds and never will! Okay what's positive about this movie? I did like the special effects, and the special effects and Keanu Reeves in his Matrix part 4 role; especially the special effects he did. Did I mention the special effects already? No, no nonsense, I quite liked the three main actors, and even John Cleese was fun to watch, although pretty unbelievable as a scientist.Okay what's negative about this movie? Well, the rest. The story is crap and unbelievable, and definitely less than the original. Somehow crappywood studios still seem to think that they can make any movie a blockbuster as long as they fill them with heaps of special effects. I guess they're right, and a future filled with even crappier superhero movies seems to be its evidence.I'll challenge anyone to count the number of not-so-hidden commercials in this movie, at least that gave me something to do while I wasn't enjoying the movie and thinking about all the things I could have done with my $16.50. I guess I should have bought myself a real SciFi book.

218,LBytes,A decent remake that could've been better,8,9 September 2009,"The Day... starts out well enough and has some good thoughtful ideas, but ultimately loses at the end after its innovations gets chipped away, leaving only derivative formula.The Day... is faithful in many ways to the original, except that Klaatu doesn't really have a message for Earthlings. We are considered a planetwide pest that must be removed so that Earth may live. Thus it is reasonable that Klaatu isn't very talkative or in for chats with the gov't types sent to check him out, generally being rude hosts to the spacefarer.With that setting I think the movie plays out fairly well, but there's problems. I didn't care for Benson's stepson; compared to the perky kid from the original, his role as a brat drags the movie down. Bates' Sec'y of Defense and her minions are typical Hollywood gov't. goons and get zero for distinctiveness, but they do move the story along in more or less the same way the Army idiots did in the '51 movie.The biggest disappointment is GORT. GORT is great as he's originally introduced, and continues to represent the ultimate menace very well, until he doesn't. Then GORT gets Hollywoodized with flashy CGI stuff and is no longer GORT as we all know and love but a sort of nanobot locust swarm. The filmmakers seemed to know that the original GORT was cool, and his nanobot structure was a neat idea, but evidently they can't resist their addiction to CGI and mess him up.

Jennifer Connelly was equally bland and looked like a younger version of Demi Moore. And the CGI version of Gort LOOKED like CGI. The only reason I gave it three stars is because I wanted it to be so much better than it was - and got the feeling this film wasn't so much bad acting as it was bad writing, bad direction, and bad FX. And I suspect that when veteran actors like Reeves and Connelly saw the theatrical version of the film, a part of them wanted to ""disown"" their participation.This film is scary in one other way. It makes me worry about other upcoming SF remakes - like ""Forbidden Planet,"" ""When Worlds Collide,"" and ""This Island Earth."" This TDTESS remake really pales in comparison to the original.

Fox...you dropped the ball I'm sad to say. Perhaps it is true what many Sci-Fi fans insist. Great remakes are few and rare. After today's waste of time & money I have to agree. Now let's talk about the flaws. Keanu was so one dimensional that it became boring. What ever you were paid it was undeserved. The fact that the viewer is dragged thru a lame and less interesting plot from the original sets this movie on a train wreck collision. Why the alien has arrived and why the earth is in peril is a slap in the face compared to the classic motive set forth in the original. Most painful is the cartoonish way the military is portrayed in this film. It is very much like the way the 51' movie portrayed them. Gort (the ominous almost limitless of powers guardian of the world) fell far short of taking this film to heights that it could have achieved. Finally, the ending smacks of confusion and disappointment never accomplishing anything of merit. There was some degree of praise to Jennifer Connelly. She gave a stellar performance considering the poor script and direction of her character. Wil Smith's son just gets a C+ and only because he finally delivered on the closing scenes. What I've learned now is...Don't get your hopes up. It just ain't worth it. By the way. Ron Howard would have delivered on the goods had he been given the chance to remake this classic. Even Speilburg would have shown the way.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
221,pressboard,The Day the Face Stood Still - Directors's Emotionless Version,3,16 December 2008,"There can be no argument that the original 1951 film with Michael Rennie is a Classic. Besides freezing post war DC forever in celluloid, it was also post war in attitude. War is awful, ugly and violent and will lead to the complete destruction of human life on earth. It was a clear message summed up by Klaatu's last words at the end of the movie. I mention the earlier movie to help illustrate what is wrong with the remake. Once again, if the viewer does not connect with characters than the viewer will not care what happens to those characters. Even with his stone face, Michael Rennie, by nuance of voice and expression could convey a range of emotions and the viewer connects with him throughout the original movie. Keanu Reeves, either by choice or direction, conveys nothing while leaving one with the impression that there is nothing more behind those bland eyes to convey. The young boy, Jaden Smith, is presented as this angry little genius who is so much smarter than the adults (evidently from birth) and displays none of the reactions one would normally see in a child of his age. Jennifer Connelly, who has done some excellent work in other films, is not allowed to use that talent in this film. One would at least expect some unintentional humor, given Keanu's deadpan performance, but even this is absent. Other than a bare storyline, this remake bears no resemblance to the original movie or to the original short story ""Farewell to the Master"" by Harry Bates. Director Scott Derrickson dropped the ball on this one - big time. My feeling here is that the producers wanted to grab the fans of the classic film and create new fans with eye-popping CG and they achieved that much, the movie should make money. This movie will be forgotten faster than Karl Rove, so it is hard to recommend even as a DVD release. What a waste of time and money - not the first movie to do this and certainly not the last.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

225,kirksworks,Klaatu barada no-go,2,16 December 2008,"I could actually write a review of this film with one word: Wha? But to elaborate... What were they thinking? Sure, they got a good title to work with. ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is a title that always had kick, but the people who made the remake didn't seem to understand it was more than the title that made the original film work. When Michael Rennie as Klaatu comes down to Washington D.C. in the original film, there was a political subtext set in place. But, lo and behold, what made the film work is that after being captured by the military industrial complex Klaatu gives them the slip and finds himself among the common people to learn what makes them tick. This notion was almost completely abandoned in the remake, and replaced with Klaatu dealing with scientists. Patricia Neal was so likable and believable in the original. She felt very much like one of us. Jennifer Connelly's scientist character in the remake could never hope to connect with audiences the same way. Not her fault, either. Some critics have blasted Connelly's performance, but it was her character and the script that are to blame, not her. She tried. No one could make saying, ""Give us another chance!"" over and over again work. When I first heard that the film was being remade I was certainly curious about the casting. When I saw that Keanu Reeves would play Klaatu, it was a clear sign that the studio had no idea what they were dealing with. On the other hand, what if they had been a bit more adventurous and Jennifer Connelly would play Klaatu? Much better idea making the alien a woman. But don't switch the roles. Keanu would have to go. Not that he was bad as Klaatu as it was written. As written Reeves was perfect. But the concept of Klaatu as somewhat robotic and emotionless works against the basic concept. And the whole idea of changing the mission to one of destruction because Earthlings were going to destroy the planet does not have as much resonance as the original idea of Earthlings ability to threaten the intergalactic universe with nuclear power.And the remake uses the earth standing still as the climax of the film. Why? Something seemed missing. The film needed another 20 mins. No ""klaatu barada nikto"" to stop Gort from destroying the planet. No, now we have a swarm of robotic locust that just magically stop destroying everything in their path when Keanu goes inside the space globe. Now the new Klaatu being able to see the heart of humanity was a good idea, but it was just clumsily handled. The graveyard scene was supposed to draw memories of the original film, but the emotional moment between the kid, Jaden Smith, and Connelly was not earned, even though the performances were okay. This is why everyone is saying Smith and Connelly were such bad actors. The script didn't earn their performances. And what was that stupid scene at the beginning of the movie with that guy in the snow storm (also played by Keanu)? We see he'd been used to take a sample so the alien Klaatu could enter Earth's atmosphere, but a line of dialog later explains that perfectly. No need for that long opening sequence. Add more time to explain what happens to earth now that everything has stood still. Because at the end of the film, all I could think was... wha?",The Day the Earth Stood Still
226,amexspam,The Day That Time Stood Still,4,8 October 2010,"I can accept good re-imagined remakes. The new Star Trek movie is an excellent example of this. But this movie was un-imaged. As stated by others the special effect weren't. I was confused by which one was the robot and which was Keunu Reeves because the acting was identical. The movie had long periods where the characters watched the blue screen waiting for something to happen, but unfortunately so did the audience and it never did. And then to wrap it all up with an ending that was completely unrealistic and unbelievable. On the plus side Jennifer Connelly was okay in her role and the actor playing her stepson didn't spike himself.

I went to the cinema with the expectation that this was going to be very disappointing - but in fact it wasn't too bad. My only gripe was the characterisation of Gort - which turned out to be a 'hive-being' made up of bio-mechanical locusts which promptly flew around the world literally consuming everything. I did like the 'Ark' concept (also not in the original film). I just rather they'd used a high-tech mechanical Gort and a futuristic space craft rather than the organic 'sphere' we have here - it was just more fun that way in the original. Two other points - they should have used the original Bernard Herrmann score and they should have worked-in the classic original phrase 'Klaatu barada nikto'.Be warned there is some rather blatant Microsoft 'Windoze' product placement in this film which really annoyed me. Keanu Reeves's performance as Klaatu was suitably other-worldly, but as a result - rather cold and humorless - I preferred Michael Rennie's original.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

229,thao,A walk through the Bible (with some problems on the way),6,10 December 2008,"I'm a fan of the original film so I really looked forward to this film. I believe that Sci-Fi films lend them self best to remakes and I thought that an update to environmental subjects was a clever way to approach it.Let me just clarify one thing first. If you are a fan of the original then don't expect this to be as good. It is by no means a bad film. In fact it is good but it never reaches its potentials. Here are the main problems: 1) I really had troubles with the editing and the rhythm of the film. It just did not flow naturally. Often it would be cut and we would not get an establishing shot before much later, leaving the audience kind of lost in the meanwhile. Also I think it just did not ""breath"" right. I'm not a fan of the frantic editing in many new films so maybe it had something to do with that.2) The film became a little too sentimental in the end and I did not believe in the ""prove"" Klaatu got in the end.3) It was not well directed (which also explains the problem with the rhythm of the film) and the kid kind of bothered me. He acts badly, especially in the scene at the graveyard and when Klaatu takes his hand when he is about to fall. This is something the director should have spotted and done better.I did however like Keanu Reeves. He was very convincing as an alien in a human body and most of the special effects where great. The only SE I did not like was Gort. He looked to much like a computer graphic.The original film is a famous Christ Figure film (retelling of the life of Christ in new circumstances). This time they really wanted to make sure the audience got it, and it does not only draw on the New Testament, but also Noah and his Arc and the plagues in Egypt.Klaatu has even more Christ like powers than before. He heals people, raise up the dead, sacrifices him self and ascends to heaven.A good remake of a great film, which could have been better.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
230,Medacakathareal,Never really gets started,6,13 December 2008,"The problem with remakes is that a good portion of the fan-base for the original have their collective negative expectations stacked against the film. I, myself, have only seen chunks of the original on television and elsewhere, but what I've seen leaves me agreeing with the nerds that the original is a solid sci-fi film that needed no remake. Remake needed or not Hollywood wants its holiday season cash.First let me say that I generally liked the film, it was a pretty fun film to see in the theater. It was atmospheric, mysterious, and the special effects were good. Keanu Reeves is wooden and kinda creepy as Klaatu, but since he spends much of the film in a suit using his alien ""powers"" it was more like he was reprising his role as Neo than forging anything new (especially since, just like in the Matrix, he starts naked and covered in goo).The plot never really goes anywhere, all it consists of is the Secretary of State trying to hold the USA together, Keanu Reeves getting driven around by Jeniffer Connelly, and some neat special effects.The one stand-out moment of the film, at least for a Python fan such as myself, is the cameo by John Cleese.So the plot builds almost no suspense and is filled with product placements (Microsoft, McDonald's, etc) but the directing is competent, the music atmospheric, the acting passable, and the special effects top notch, hence why I'm giving this one a 6 out of 10.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
231,vincentga,More ridiculous that ridiculous,2,25 March 2009,"Yet another reprise of a classic film. And once again a disaster.

If you have a name in Hollywood you can do anything. And all the people are happy. This is not the Earth that should stop (turning), but the shooting of this film. It's really ridiculous. Examples: The mother with an alien, and drags her child wherever she goes. The alien has come to destroy the Earth. It is supposed to know the human species. But in the film we see that he knew nothing. Yet it took thousands of years for that. Too bad that 50 years the writers and all the people of Hollywood have not changed at all. If this is in the financial field. I give this film a 2 / 10. Because what the film cost, we could have made a good story. But unfortunately, Hollywood is controlled by the group of people.

233,johcafra,The Law of the Remake,6,12 December 2008,"Herewith: Don't contemplate making one unless (a) you plan to tell the viewer something the original could have but did not, and (b) you full well know the viewer knows and wants that. It's not enough to hang your hat on a perceived need to update, for a film is very much a product of its time regardless of the filmmakers' striving otherwise. And re-branding the remake ""a re-imagining"" won't help, for if you stop long enough to think, EVERYTHING is a re-imagining.This remake of a deserved classic is at the very least done in earnest. The talent is there and I can readily understand his casting, but Keanu Reeves just can't ever seem more than what he is. The other players are, to me at least, simply there, irritants at worst, while John Cleese only reminds me that he is no Sam Jaffe. The FX are what they seamlessly are, and thanks in large part to them I frankly felt good seeing part of northern New Jersey get eaten. Plot- and character-wise, comparisons with John Carpenter's Starman are more apt.Irony of ironies, I felt obliged to view the remake because of my fondness for the original film version (ca. 1951). If you've not viewed the original, you're entitled to think the remake fresh and topical, and to draw your own impressions and pleasures from the viewing. But for a great many the comparison with the original is inevitable. It's certainly dated but sadly no less topical, and a lasting testament to how well the genre can be represented with how little (in black-and-white no less), the gifted Robert Wise at the helm, perfect casting, and one of my all-time favorite musical scores.In fairness both film versions take substantial liberties with the source short novel (ca. 1940), which has among the finest closing acts and lines in the genre.

As others have commented, the special effects were so bad. So I'm just going to talk about the opening scene. In the original we saw the UFO flying over Washington DC. People would look up and scream.That was probably one of the best build ups in the original. And also when Gort appeared in the original it really surprised everybody. Now I fast forward to this one which I saw quite a while ago. The special effects are absolutely atrocious if that's the right word. You would think that if they can build a real robot for the Lost in Space TV show and movie. And real robot for Forbidden Planet. You would think with this budget they could build a real robot for this movie. Nope.Nope we get Mister CGI robot. Then quite frankly where on Earth is the spaceship? I was really hoping for a cool looking spaceship. Doesn't have to be fancy. Just so you know in the original Lost in Space, Irwin Allen actually built a prop that stood on three legs.I was really hoping to see something like a cool landing.

236,DesertDogMedia,The Day The Earth Stood Still,7,4 July 2014,"Title: The Day the Earth Stood StillCondensed Storyline: Remake of the 50's movie of the same name. The first scene is just there to explain the later plot, the following scene introduces us to Helen and her step son. Helen is take into federal custody and transported to a military base where she boards a military helicopter filled with solders and other scientists. They find out something is heading for earth and is going to crash. The object lands on earth and is treated with a typical American greeting, getting shot once it exits it's space craft. The spaceman appears to be a human, but seems to have some powers as seen in the interrogation scene. The stand in for the government wants him secure because she fears the unknown as well as fearing what is more advanced than she is. The military try destroying the giant standing in the middle of the park, but it takes them down every time they try, that is before they transport it to a different location and try to analyze it. This turns out the be bad as it turns into tiny mites that eat everything. The spaceman's plans were to catalog every species on earth and put them into an ark, before it released the mites which would sterilize the planet because humans are killing it. So the spaceman has to make a choice at the end whether to let the humans die because they will not change, or give his own life and give the humans a chance to fix their ways. He chooses the later and gives his life so the humans can live to fix their ways. Notable Acting: Keanu Reeves was born to play this part, just like that of Neo in the Matrix. He is so calm and collective, never showing any strong emotion. He seems perfect for the role. Helen played by Jennifer Connelly is a good actor who portrays her part to the point where I actually believe she is wanting the best of intentions for the alien. Kathy Bates plays the stand in for the president and actually looks like she believes what she is saying as she feels threatened by this creature of greater advancement. The child actor is one I do not like, but I don't like child actors in general. Everyone else was good in their own respects. Noticeable Camera work: Zoom out shot in the opening scene. But the rest of the filming really annoyed me, mainly because of how shaky it was, even for static shots where a tri-pod or even a harness could have been used. I have seen college projects by film students more professionally shot than this. But it improves later on into the movie, thankfully.Graphics: The CGI is good, the swarm cloud is decent. I would say more but I'm not sure if it was suppose to turn out that way or not, but it is decent for the standards of this movie. But for showing how the mites spread and each everything, that is when the decent turns into good as it does look realistic, as is the point of most CGI. Bar the ones which are just there for doing effects that practical props cannot do. Overall Feel: I have a feeling the writer of this is very bias on their view of how America/Humans would treat aliens. Especially as the stand in for the president is only doing what she sees as right, but the only reason she sees this as right is because humans are so violent and expect said violence in return. The movie can spark political debates on what is the best course of action and whether we should act hostile to others in expectation of their own hostility. But the movie bats between being bias and non-bias, but it does it a lot mainly leaning to the bias side. Later into the movie, you find out that the movie had two messages in it. The first being not everything is out to kill humanity as presenting hostility will only end in hostility and the second point is that if you do not recycle a man from space will come and kill you. The should be the Green Party's new campaign slogan. Back to serious tone, the movie presents you with two important lessons and I feel they are presented as good as could be done so in a movie. Not preached throughout the entire movie and not just addressed at the last second. They are presented and then we get a reminder of them every know and then. That is how a movie is done. Sadly the only thing that lets it down is the fact that the camera work wasn't as good as it could have been. But everything else was good, the story for the most part was solid and coherent, the acting was sincere and believable and the props and CGI were decent at the lowest state. So I enjoyed this movie, it also gives you quite a bit to think about if you like to think deeper into movies and be an active watcher. But with most movies of this sort, you get to feel smug when the military finally realise the irony of the situation, along with the presidential stand in realizing the irony as well.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

238,Neenee-b,The Earth Stood Still,7,14 December 2008,"I went to see The Day The Earth Stood Still and I expecting nothing less than a 2008 version of Independence Day with Keanu Reeves instead of Will Smith. It wasn't. Not even in the slightest.The movie starts of with Keanu Reeves hiking up some snow covered mountain in India for reasons to complex for the simple movie watcher to understand i.e. for no apparent reason and not explained to the audience. We then cut to the wonderful Jennifer Connelly saying something to scientific for the simple movie watcher to understand i.e. to show the audience that she is intelligent. The movie speeds on at reasonable pace as a meteor is heading straight for earth, well when I say earth, I actually mean New York, which as we all know represents everything and everyone on earth. Jennifer Connelly, along with the US army and a few scientists who are all wearing glasses so that the simple movie watcher understands that these people are as intelligent as Jennifer, all head to Central Park where this big alien marble plants itself. Kathy Bates, sporting beehive that Marge Simpson would covet, was the Head of Defence. I didn't really pay much attention to her in any way, shape or form as I was to busy trying to remember where I knew her from - Titanic and Misery.Now New York has had its fair share of movie related disasters in recent times, whether it be tidal waves, asteroids, infectious zombie diseases, asteroids again (Deep Impact and Armageddon are apparently two different movies) but New Yorkers do not understand the concept of running - when a disaster happens I like to think that I will be running in the opposite direction shrieking like a crazy fool rather than standing watching the events unfold that will lead to my untimely death.Anyhow, instead of the earth being destroyed something even more bizarre happens when Keanu Reeves and what can only be described as an early concept drawing of a Sentinel abandoned from the X-Men series step out of the big alien marble.The US army in full on ""attack now ask questions and sheepishly apologise later"" mode shoot poor Keanu and off they all head (Jennifer Connelly included) to Area51 where Keanu easily escapes from and heads to his nearest police station (W.T.F!) and calls Jennifer Connelly who, along with her step-son collects him.Turns out that earth is important to other alien races as it can sustain intelligent life, the most intelligent of us all being John Cleese. John discovers that humans are on the brink of destroying the planet and because they are only on the brink of their own man made self destruction they can be brought back from the brink if Keanu just gets back into his marble and leaves them alone. Which he does. Not straight away of course. It is only after a speech from Jaden Smith, who will keep the Smith acting dynasty lasting longer then the Douglas's, Sheens and hell even the Baldwin's, that breaks the ever stiff and straight (A.K.A CANNOT ACT TO SAVE HIS LIFE) Keanu into realising that humans are in fact OK and can change their ways.So he gets into his marble and leaves and the movie ends. Seriously.I was deceived by the trailer, I thought I was going to see an action movie with Keanu in full on ""Gun Totting American Don't Worry We Will Save Only America"" mode. It wasn't. It was more of a drama with only a few hints of action, which ultimately came to nothing - then the movie ended.And you know - I actually quite liked it 7/10.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

In fact the only way this film would have made any sense is by an operatic, Allan Jones, solo then segue into the scene where ""Freedonia's going to war"" with the Marx Brothers sans Zeppo, as that role was already filled aptly enough with the presence of Keanu Reeves. Jennifer Connelly was there as ""eye candy"" but the film fell short there as well.

241,mokshjuneja,The day the Earth stood still,3,13 December 2008,"I will be sipping my coffee, reading paper, tweeting & wait for the moment to pass!!I was so upset after watching the movie - ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"". there is this particular scene, where you can see the shadows of the trees moving at break neck speed, due to the light from the kind of alien space ship moving above them, but the humans who were standing close by didn't have an iota of shadows. what happened CGI/animators forgot humans do have a shadow?My expectations from the movie was quiet high, specially with title of the movie like that! You need to see more of the calamity, as how the Earth will end, a little more inspiring protagonist or was he the antagonist? he, Klaatu (played by Keanu Reeves) himself had the most confusing character, most robotic dialogues, and tried not to show any affection. Keanu and his character was a complete let down. At one point of time, he was here to protect the world and in an another sequence he wanted destroy mankind. oops, isn't that all the aliens do, regularly!!On the other hand, Dr. Helen Benson (played by Jennefir Connelley) has the only task of convincing the Keanu that human beings will change and they can live in harmony with other species and amongst themselves. Sometimes, he believes it, other times, he does not! Oh my god, here i go again writing Yes and no, in the same sentence, but dear not-so-watchers of this movie, this is how the whole movie went. Dr. Helen Benson could have actually just seduced Klaatu and shown him the worldly pleasures that earthlings enjoy. She had to choose the easy of talking to him.Jaden Smith was the only character who was asking the questions, a whole of questions, and then with more questions and all these questions were becoming very annoying! on top of that even the caramel popcorn that i was eating were very stale and had to throw them away and my this heightened my annoyance. Jaden Smith last i saw him in Pursuit of Happiness and he was really good as a child actor. When ever he said ""father"" in this movie, Will Smith would come to my mind.The storyline was quiet weak. Specially since when you have seen Independence Day, you are expectations keep on increasing!! You want to see something different, not some guy coming and telling you ""I am an alien"" in a hoarse voice, then saying, ""i have come to kill human beings."" Ha! ha! ha!The good thing in the movie is again reminding people that it is that each one of us will need to make difference towards global warming and living in harmony!! Till that time comes by, we will need to realise that we also need live in harmony and take care of other species, also.There are these two scenes one should not miss in the movie 1. 40 ft trailer running on National Highway subliming into thin air 2. The conversation between the Klaatu and the polygrapher. The look that Keanu Reeves gives on being asked, ""are you aware of an impending attack... on Planet Earth"". this is what was more desired in the movie.Please do not get fooled by the Taj Mahal in the posters, there is no Taj Mahal in the movie.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
242,jpc-19,"Hello Klaatu, its the earths leaders on a path to greed and destruction",7,24 February 2019,"Story is flawed. I dont know why the humans want the race saved so bad when the scientists know that its always driven to ground by bad leadership and greed. If they were smart enough to get to earth have a cool robot then the legwork done be the oriental alien should have told them where the problem is, all they have to do is rearrange the chess pieces. Instead of destroying humans they opt to leave them without electricity, sounds like a worse disaster for earth. Why couldnt Klaatu even been able to speak to any leaders, the US president must be in a higher plane then powerful aliens, much less the worlds. So the US president screwed up any dialog by playing isolation from the alien. Just like Lincoln after 500k people get killed, hes regarded as a great president.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

I bet the old one from 1951 had more suspense than this Hollywood garbage.Yes, the movie had a captivating start that left you with questions you wanted answered. Yes, Keanu plays a magnificent alien and his character is likable yet confusing at times because you're expected to believe he's bad, then good again, then bad. It leaves you wondering where the filmmakers were going with that transformation. A lot of people (myself included) probably thought this was a futuristic type earth-ridden disaster because the marketing showed the only action/destruction scenes in the preview.Like Wall-E, it's a wake-up call for humans to stop treating the earth bad, but in my opinion, Wall-E was crap and so was this. The only positives were Will Smith's adorable son and Keanu.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
244,redeyedtree,A+ for special effects,7,13 May 2010,"It's been a long time since I wrote a review. I have put off watching the 2008 adaptation of the 1951 movie The Day the Earth Stood Still. I loved the 1951 version and did not want to taint that in any way. What I love about movies that are pre-special effects is that their strength is in the story. My somewhat inflated vote of 8 rests entirely on the special effects. For acting and story I give a 6/7. I liked the micro-plots: for example, the step-mother/step-son evolution in their relationship. It is also true that we only really find out who we are, what we are made of, when adversity strikes. Will I stand tall or will I cave in? Will I listen to others or trust in my personal values? Am I about material things or spiritual things or emotional things? Who do I turn to in my time of need? Though John Cleese was only on screen for a few minutes, they were thought provoking few minutes as he and Reeves have a dialoge. The 1951 version of The Day the Earth Stood still rocks but for entertainment value and superb special effects it is worth watching the 2008 version (oh! And for all you girls out there, Keanu doesn't disappoint).",The Day the Earth Stood Still
245,rjyelverton,"""Earth"" trudges toward finish line",4,12 December 2008,"""Earth"" is a very sincere, but plodding cautionary tale about the impending likelihood of do-gooder aliens holding an intervention for Earth. Concern for the planet is popular again and we've gotten a slew of films this year to prove it from the compulsively watchable, but goofy ""The Happening"" to the superb ""Wall E."" I appreciate the intent of these films in an age where we are treating the Earth as if it is expendable and conservation is considered unpatriotic, but the intent of ""Earth"" was not enough to save it from a thin script and stiff lead performance by Keanu Reeves as the alien Klaatu. In the movie, GORT is the automaton and Klaatu is autonomous, but Reeves is out to convince you otherwise.The film starts out promisingly enough as an impending emergency leads to the forceful removal of astro-biologist Dr. Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) from her home by the Feds. She is sequestered to a military compound where soldiers and scientists are gathering to attempt to avert a likely disaster. But as the film settles in, we begin to find out that this story is going to hinge on the relationship between Helen and her estranged stepson Jacob (played by Will Smith's son Jaden). This isn't really all that compelling as the two don't have insurmountable problems to begin with. Klaatu will be their therapist and as helicopters explode and GORT revs up for destruction, Helen and Jacob hash it out in a tame, reasonable manner.When GORT unleashes his fury, the film has some fun. But it's a fakey CGI fun reminiscent of the scarab attacks in the recent Mummy. Though the stakes are huge in this story--the survival of the Earth--the film never successfully creates a sense of impending doom. The army acts in predictable ways and is continually foiled by the aliens in a timeworn fashion. Kathy Bates as the Secretary of Defense is in charge of the US response and she seems only mildly perturbed by the crisis. This film is guilty of going through the motions, taking us nowhere new, and lacking a pulse. A predictable, slumping movie that trudges along to the finish line.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
246,martijn-56,"No resonance, but some nice effects. I never heard of Bach before?",7,20 December 2008,"This movie tried to please all. It failed to please any. The genre is not dead I hope, but a good plot is hard to find. ID-4 did once as much deliver as it was convincing: city sized UFO's suddenly there, unforgettable shots, like the shadows in Central Park, the explosions and the Area 51 true size set. A lot of money spent, which showed! It had a happy end and humor, too. OK, it took a cartoon plot with a comedy end. But it was brilliantly spectacular, fun, with many story elements of people and places coming together. That was 1996. Since then we have had the Matrix, the bar is higher, the mood has shifted. The start of The Day The Earth Stood Still was good, drawing me in, as any UFO landing would do. I also liked the beautiful mysterious worlds of light appearing everywhere, and the idea of a human born alien  although the telepathy in ID-4 was somehow more appropriately distant from us, and more compelling. Then the movie lost it; Keanu being shot trying to reach out to the first human hand. No infrared binoculars, nor strict instructions for the soldiers there? Bad start, but his organic Samsonite absorbed the bullet and saved the bad story. Why did Keanu let himself be captured, without simply using his power immediately? To increase suspense on his intentions? Are authorities since Jaws always stupid and bad? JFK would have given him his UN chat he wanted. Keanu escaped. Then what? He knew too little about us. Any smart alien that can solve quantum mechanics (or was it Einstein's Relativity with the non-zero cosmological constant?) would have done his homework, also on our nature: most of us never change, not even on the brink of disaster, or we would spoil everything again later. Until then the movie had some suspense, but when our impending doom became clear the race to give us a second chance was not as gripping as it could have been. Was another plot needed?Too many loose ends, too. Why was a total sum of preserved species more important than preservation of intelligent life? Perhaps we were not intelligent enough anyway. Then the human shaped robot. Its only purpose was to expel the vital dust that would erase mankind, or was it a blast from the past to show this was a remake? The only interesting plot would have been a big one, not a miniature 'your daddy is dead honey' story focusing on problems of a mother with her son. He was hanging out only with them. How about mankind? Wouldn't a study of the mass behavior underlying our problems have given a much more interesting plot idea? This movie took Keanu to a 'real' leader. A Nobel Prize winner, of course. Why not just a kind neighbor called Jim? Keanu then would walk up to the (loud) speakers to hear him whisper 'the Rolling Stones' instead of 'It's Bach'. The Goldberg Variations are indeed great, but since Hannibal Lecter now a tune reserved for smart people? Keanu could have listened to 'you can't always get what you want', 'sympathy for the devil', 'time is on our side'. After 'welcome to the jungle' and 'run to the hills' he would have said 'this stuff rocks' instead of 'it's beautiful'. Jim would have offered him his last beer. Isn't sacrifice also noble? Jim: 'It's Bud'. Alien: 'It's heaven'. What now? We die, no more beer ergo, Bud became the beer that saved the world! Serious, Keanu should have made it to the UN. The real challenge of the story is how all people can come together to fix the dichotomy between individuals and countries. Keanu could have given us some difficult task, not only to stop eating McDonalds and watching Oprah, but more like 'invent something I cannot do, a wormhole', 'hands across America' reloaded. Perhaps 'make a good science fiction remake? Could we pull that off? Nobody knows, nor would the world. Every hour wasted would mean one city down or so, as in ID-4? It would increase tension for sure. Theme: our salvation as a collective effort. Not that of a mother seeing her dead husband back in her son, the catharsis that nothing is wasted. Enough material for Keanu's epiphany like 'o, humans can be nice after all'? What if he would have met an asocial family instead? Maybe Keanu should have destroyed us, except some sterilized people with low IQ scores to insure they would never rethink string theory to rebuild everything in no time. That plot might have had some resonance. Keanu's take-off left me empty handed. He pulled the plug on our industrial revolution. Was that all he'd got? Steven Seagal would have said 'then I will have to kill you'. No more electricity? Our civilization would surely not end in the happy rebuilding as in WALL-E. But hey, thrown back to the Stone Age, wars and environmental destruction would give a nice Mad Max sequel for next summer!I give a 7 since I was still entertained. Reeves and John Cleese did a good show for their script. Audiences are spoiled now. It takes a lot for a movie to be unforgettable. Still, I like the genre. UFO's, effects, good actors and a big budget are not enough. Suspense comes also from plot. And often uncompromising scenes are the most memorable. Alien showed that in 1979. A missed chance. Let us hope that 'As Worlds Collide' will show us not only more effects we have never seen before, but that it will focus on the human condition better. Nice anyway to see Keanu back in space!",The Day the Earth Stood Still
247,Shuggy,"Hated it, but not for the reasons I expected",2,17 December 2008,"I knew I was going to hate this movie, but I felt duty-bound to see it so that I could criticise it from a position of knowledge.I knew I was going to hate it because I love the 1951 version as an important part of my childhood, and any imitation other than the kind of loving, insightful job Peter Jackson did on ""King Kong"" was bound to fail, and there was plenty of advance warning (beginning with the casting of Keanu Reeves) it was not going to be that.What I didn't expect was that it would be so bad in so many new ways.To start with, changing humankind's risk to the universe from nuclear destruction to environmental destruction doesn't make a lot of sense, nor does the idea that the earth is a valuable resource because it has multicellular organisms. (They started to develop the idea that the alien spheres were sampling terrestrial life - the spheres as ""arks"" - but didn't take it anywhere.) Homo sapiens, with all our faults, has to be the most interesting species on this planet, and while I sympathise with the idea of wiping us out and letting the earth take its chances of evolving an(other) intelligent species, that is hardly a likely alien policy.The idea of using a swarm of metal-eating nanobots to wipe humans out makes even less sense. The nanobots themselves, and whatever they use for power, are a blot on the environment that makes anything we do look relatively trivial. And when they could eat an articulated truck in seconds, why did it take them so long to make holes in a jacket? Klaatu's stopping of electricity in TDTESS 1951 was a warning, and a fine theatrical moment whose essence was that nothing moved, all at the same time. In 2008, by switching lights off block by block, much of the dramatic impetus was lost.Gort (1951)'s height of 8 feet was quite enough for him to be fearsome - especially when he opened his eyelid and fired his death-ray. The threat when it began to open again on Patricia Neal and her delay in saying the magic words is one of the great moments of movie history. Why the makers of Gort (2008) thought so much bigger was any better is baffling. The creasing at Gort (1951)'s knees was preferable to Gort (2008)'s jointlessness. CGI? - he might as well have been inflatable. Rather strikingly, Gort and Klaatu had no discernible relationship, Gort having nanobotificated by the time Klaatu needed help. The relationship between the two was at the heart of TDTESS 1951 (and in the short story, the punchline was that their relationship was the reverse of what we imagined). With Gort 2008 not going anywhere, there was no particular point to him being humanoid - and indeed with Klaatu not being human, that was quite anomalous.And I haven't even started on the sentient beings. Jacob Benson (Jaden Smith) has to be the most irritating character since Jar Jar Binks. If Klaatu took him as a model, he'd wipe out humankind without thinking twice. At the heart of TDTESS 1951 was the bonding between Bobby and ""Mr Carpenter"" (even though his mother would never have risked it today).Of Keanu Reeves as Klaatu, enough has been said already (I think I was one of the first, but I'm certainly not the last, to say he would have been better cast as Gort). At least we were spared any attempt at the Christ-like characteristics that so much better suited Michael Rennie's Klaatu. (While Rennie's final message was just as fascistic as Reeves', his portrayal had a warmth that animated the whole movie - you *cared* whether he lived or died.) Jennifer Connelly at least didn't screw up the Patricia Neal part; concerned mother, skilled scientist, human being, she did her best to hold the film together. It's just a pity that she didn't get a single strong speech to defend the human race. ""We can change"" doesn't quite cut it.I give it two points for the agreeably marbled spaceship, quietly mocking the beauty of the earth, and for Kathy Bates as Marion Allbright, sorry, Regina Jackson, who could neatly stand in for a mercifully invisible president.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
248,georgebush,not bad,6,16 December 2008,"The Day the Earth Stood Still is a remake of a classic science fiction film of the same name. This film retains some elements of the original story. The alien and the robot come to earth on a mission. This robot is far larger than in the original. But the robot in the original conveyed far more dangerous feeling. One of the main parts missing from this film was the brilliant encounter between the robot and the female lead and child. In the original. The robot is going to kill the woman unless she can remember the code words that prevent attack. That was a dramatic moment that was entirely missing.Another main facet of the original film was the danger that the alien man was constantly encountering. In that film, the robot was instructed to destroy the world if the alien man dies. There were many scenes in which the alien narrowly escapes in the original which made it a classic science fiction thriller. This film reverses that and the alien is obviously invincible and it is the earth people who are consistently in danger. In this film humans are very weak and so there is very little dramatic tension.There are obviously some larger points that the film is trying to present. The point about history early in the film is more or less incorrect. The Secretary of State makes the academic point that in history the powerful civilization or country are always victorious and used Columbus and and American Indians to support that point. The story then adds that now humans are weak and the aliens are the superior force similar to history. That view of history is not correct. It is quite the opposite. The powerful pagan Roman Empire attempted to wipe out religious people but today that empire is gone and Jews and Christians remain. The powerful Soviet empire attacked and subdued Poland and today the Soviet empire is gone and Poland is free. The Nazi super military force attempted to destroy the Judaeo civilization and the Nazi caused great grief but are now gone. The use of Native Americans as an example is also faulty because that encounter took place over hundred of years and not in a massive invasion. It could be also argued also that the Great British Empire was defeated by the weaker American forces in the American Revolution. Napolean's powerful nation also was initially victorious but eventually came crashing down. throughout history it is ideas that refuse to go away. it is true that the more powerful North was victorious against the South in the Civil War. But all these cases, have different outcomes and the interpretation of history is incorrect in the film.Another large point in the film is concerning technology. The alien comes to earth deeply concerned with environmental issues. The environment and technology are two separate issues. But, inadvertently or not, the film ultimately seems to be questioning the overwhelming technology that is so much a part of the modern world and less about pollution. It makes one think about how computers, cell phones, cars, airplanes have made the world less personal. With families and friends constantly separating and spreading out all over the world. The film seems to propose a simpler less technological world in which people don't speed through life on cell phones etc. The film is very blatantly trying to be about large issues and sometimes the story almost seems secondary. it does refer to how ordinary humans or aliens have to respond dramatically in extraordinary circumstances when on the ""precipice.""Of course with science fiction, literature ,or art, imagination is required to appreciate it.The original is more of a good story and a great classic. The robot in the first film was great and the characters really stayed with the viewer. The acting in this film was pretty good. The boy did a pretty good job especially the final part. This film is not too bad.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

251,tfc,Not like the 1950's version and Keanu Reeves knows it. A few modest suggestions,3,5 April 2009,"I saw The Day the Earth Stood Still (TDTESS) (2008) twice, have read several user comments, and cannot add anything new about how anticlimactic the new ""improved"" version was. I felt sorry for Keanu Reeves. Rather than complain about what was done, IMHO, I would submit my re-imaging suggestions of how I expected TDTESS should have been made to contrast what was lacking in the new version.The Plot: In 1896, a dying man in the Klondike's is taken a by metallic sphere. Present day, an ovoid object comes towards Earth and circles the Earth several dozen times. The spaceship lands near the UN in daylight and is still for three days. Worldwide financial/military/civil panic ensues. Klaatu (Mr. 1896) emerges saying ""I am Klaatu and come in peace and goodwill "". Klaatu holds out a scroll like tube and is shot at by an insane man who screams about the end of the world. People start yelling gun! Klaatu is shot by a soldier. Suddenly a large 7' Gort is now outside the spaceship. Gort disintegrates anything technological that is a danger to Klaatu. Gort ordered to stop and goes into a rigid stance. Klaatu says the ""scroll"" was a gift and is involuntarily taken to a hospital, heals within a day, and gives his salve to the doctors. The spaceship and Gort are impregnable and immovable.Klaatu is moved to Walter Reed. The Secretary of State offers the protection of the US to bring Klaatu's message to a divided world. Klaatu says he must maintain impartial as Earth's Klaatu (""Earth's defender"" to the Gort (Peace Enforcers)). The Secretary of Defense (SOD) comes for information on Gort and Klaatu explains the nature of Gort and for them to stay away from him. The SOD believes Gort is Klaatu's master and they want to conquer the Earth. Disappointed, Klaatu changes his appearance and Gort creates ""Mr. Carpenter"", (Mr.C) in all databases. Mr.C finds boarding offers for ""visiting scientists"" and leaves the hospital. Mr.C arrives at Dr. Helen Benson house, (War widow with a smart 13 year old son Bobby). Fearful commentators are on the news and several nations demanding access to Klaatu and his technology (i.e. salve). Klaatu's escape kept secret but there is chaos in the Government.Mr.C on his ""off time"" has time to see the WDC sites with bobby. News of Klaatu's escape, a picture of his old face, and reward announced. The world technology markets crash even more and nations become confrontational. The military ""aggressively study ways to safely destroy"" an immovable Gort and fails, in an act of frustration they encase Gort in ""Glastex"". Gort orders smaller spheres to begin taking all species off the planet, just in case. A dedicated FBI man at Walter Reed figures out Mr.C does not exist on paper, only digitally. Mr.C and bobby are watching the news and says he is saddened that Earth lacks wise people. Bobby suggests Professor Barnhardt. Barnhardt is not home, but Mrs. Barnhardt asks them to wait. Mr.C corrects Barnhardt's formula to pass the time. Barnhardt sees his changed formula (angry then awed) wants to speak to Mr.C alone to talk shop. Mr.C tells Barnhardt that he is Klaatu and needs Barnhardt's help. If Klaatu fails to convince Gort that Earth is still savable, Gort will again deconstruct all of Earth's technology for 300 years as was done 30,000 years ago when humans for the third time threatened the universe. To calm the chaos, Klaatu shuts down all but critical electrical power in the world for 30 minutes every hour for three days to calm the world and listen. Barnhardt says he will contact the world scientists/thinkers to meet and hear Klaatu's message. After the blackouts ends, the manhunt for Klaatu intensifies.Bobby tells Helen and Helen's boyfriend Tom, stuff that proves Mr.C is ""different"". When Tom later sees the updated picture of Mr.C (paper only) Tom tells the authorities for the reward. Mr.C goes to Helen's workplace and admits he's Klaatu, and then asks for her and bobby's help and car to get to NY since authorities are watching for a single man. Klaatu changes his face again but authorities figure out how to find him. Klaatu tells Helen that if anything should happen to him, she must go to Gort and say, ""Klaatu barada nikto"" or Gort will ""inflict peace on humanity"". When they are chased, Klaatu is shot dead. Gort dissolves the Glastex with nanomachines that spread slowly out eating just technology (metal/bricks/plastics), leaving organic life/materials behind. Authorities cannot stop the nanomachines and it slowly dawns on authorities that in months they will all be cavemen. Gort shows up outside the building with Klaatu's body, burns through walls to reach Klaatu, and leaves some nanomachines behind as good measure.Barnhardt gathers the prominent scientists/thinkers of the world at the spaceship and thus prevents the military from nuking Gort. Helen arrives and gives Gort Klaatu's message, the nanomachines halt, and Helen goes into the spaceship. Klaatu's corpse is revived and addresses the assembled. The world is stunned when they all clearly hear Klaatu's translated voice declare if this message is rejected, Earth and humans will be reverted to their natural state for 300 years. The professor pleads that humans can fix their problems. Klaatu is skeptical and explains why they created The Gort, peace enforcers given absolute power to squelch all aggression. Gort monitors the meeting's progress and the entire world's condition and all aggression has ceased. Gort informs Klaatu that the process will be halted, for now. Klaatu further warns that if Earth does not change their economic, ecologic, technologic ways to truly serve humanity then later attempt to extend their destructive chaotic ways into space, the Gort will return and there will be no pardon. ""The decision rests with you"". Gort and Klaatu then enter the spaceship and depart at an incredible speed.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
252,framer94,"some interesting ideas, but ultimately it sucked",4,6 April 2009,"i watched this movie based on all the negative feedback i heart about it. it started off interesting- it's got this *SPOILER- huge guardian cyborg protecting keanu, that later in the movie comes apart into millions upon millions of microscopic robotic locust like creatures that consumes every material object they come into contact with. But it turned dull real quick.there wasn't enough character development, or coverage of the aliens or their origions. keanu is like this really dull boring starman for the 21st century. this movie would have been better suited as a straight to video release (With not so many special FX & CGI jazz)... which you could find repeated regularly on some crappy cable channel like zone sc-fi or horror or something. I'm sure even a b-movie actor on a salary of $150k could deliver a more interesting performance than Neo (aka Keanu Reeves) the movie ended really abruptly also. keanu reeves redeems his role as the savior of the human race, 'Neo', in almost every movie he does (is kinda funny). keanu's acting is on a similar level to schwatzenegger's all he has to do is turn up, be himself and at the most, act icy cold.so yeah on the whole this movie sucked. i give it 4/10 for some of the creature designs and ideas. not worth watching though, it'll just leave you feeling depressed at the end of it (not because it's a beautiful sad melancholy piece of work, but because of how badly written the thing is, and also for Keanu reprising his role as Neo for like the 9th time now.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

254,unclepete,So sue me - I liked it.,6,6 January 2009,"I rather foolishly read some reviews before I went to see this film, and with EVERY single one completely panning the film I was expecting it to be dire. Nevertheless, I have a cinema subscription so it wasn't going to cost me anything, and my brother's girlfriend was mad keen to see it, so off we went.Having seen it, I can't quite understand the level of contempt felt for this film. It's a modern remake of a fifty odd year old film, of course it's not going to be a shot for shot remake! But I felt that the update was good and the alterations to story line were valid. I also felt, and believe me I'm no fan, that Keanu Reeves did a fairly creditable job. It's not so easy to be THAT wooden, and given that that was his interpretation of the role then I'd say he pulled it off effectively.The viewing experience brought to mind two other films. The first was 'War of the Worlds' which of course has undergone a similar contemporary restyling and adaptation. I think that TDTESS actually weathered the transition a little better, and I felt more comfortable with it. The other film that springs to mind was the abomination that was 'The Invasion'. Looking at scores and comments, posters here seem to be equating that film with this, when the reality is that they are worlds apart.I find the criticisms I'm reading about casting, acting, pacing, direction and scripting to be anywhere between brutally harsh and completely unfair. To my surprise as much as anyone's, I enjoyed it and I'd watch it again. Sure, do rent the original - it's a wonderful film. Whilst you're in the video store get 'The Day the Earth Caught Fire' as well - it's equally good. But don't dismiss this worthy effort out of hand.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
255,baberchik,"boring, predictable and cheezy",3,26 March 2016,"I am surprised the current rating is not a couple of points lower.This boring remake has some horrible actors, starting most notably with ""mr serious face"" Keanu Reeves who literally uses the same boring face and the same lack of emotion as always - in EVERY SINGLE MOVIE where he has a part, Will Smith's little talentless son who is there just because his daddy pulled some strings, some other familiar faces and not so much... none of whom really act the way they should be. Some characters are overdone, some just stereotypically boring (the hard- a** military, the ruthless and senseless top brass etc). The plot is basically a reboot of a classic, this time with very bad early 00's CGI, and adds very little to the original movie. The action scenes are extremely cheezy, often times outright stupid...I don't know what else to say. It's just blant and boring.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

I wont complain about acting i guess Keanus style (no expressions at all) was kinda good for the role, but the script was horrible it was like they would just do a lot of random scenes. There are also a lot of senseless stuff in this movie in every scene, i cant compare this to other movies i mean some movies might be worse than this.

Just a bunch of special effects scenes strung together by what I guess passes for a script these days. Random, disjointed nonsense and stiffest, lifeless dialogue you're likely to see (and I'm not talking about Keanu).I gave it a 2, and that was being generous.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
260,Critomaton,So bad it's... not that bad,5,21 December 2008,"The remake of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is an interesting movie. It could single-handedly revive Mystery Science Theater 3000. This review contains spoilers, so please don't read any farther until you've gone out and watched it. Trust me, just go in with very low expectations and you should be thoroughly entertained. I'll wait.OK, you're back? Cool. I don't think this movie can properly be classified as science fiction. I think it belongs in the ""pure camp"" genre. I still gave it a high rating for a bad movie because it was just so entertaining. While I went into the movie tired after a long day at work, after about ten minutes I was wide awake waiting for the next laugh-inducing scene. In this regard, the movie did not disappoint. The first few minutes explain why the aliens look like Keanu Reeves but, I mean c'mon, do they really need a reason? After that, we see the country's most important - and Hollywood's most diverse - group of civilian experts wrangled up (because of course there aren't enough people already on the government payroll and when time is of the essence you would never just make do with whoever happens to be on duty at the moment).Despite being told that there are only 78 minutes left before an object of alien origin strikes Central Park, the hot single mom astrobiologist (I'm sure they exist) has time for a quick potty break and unauthorized cell call home, before she and the other most important people in the country are whisked off by helicopter... TO THE PROJECTED CENTER OF THE IMPACT ZONE!!! Fortunately, the spaceship lands in a cloud of fog instead of crashing, and whatever preparation the government made before the impact goes to hell in a hand-basket as representatives of the police and military randomly mosey up to the sphere (which looks a lot like the globe in the fireworks display at EPCOT in Disney World).Shortly thereafter, a cartoon robot, looking slightly more real than the Iron Giant but slightly less real than Johnny Sokko's Flying Robot, comes out and vaporizes some things.This movie goes from cringe-inducingly bad to full-on hilarious during the ""lie detector"" scene, in which an alien life form is inexplicably left in a room with a lone, unarmed interrogator. An exchange of clothes funnier than any in the ""Terminator"" movies ensues.Another hysterical moment: The big action scene where the military attacks the spaceship from the safety of an air force hangar using Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles. It has all the excitement and tension of watching someone else play a video game, but don't tell that to the military guy in charge (I didn't catch his rank, but he's due for a dishonorable discharge). This guy has a conniption every time one of his attacks gets thwarted, but he never even thinks to drop a Daisy Cutter.Keanu Reeves escapes with his new duds, and promptly heads to McDonald's for a big meeting with another advance alien scout (it's entirely reasonable that aliens would find McDonald's fare palatable since it barely resembles Earth food).The entire climax of the film is foreshadowed as brother alien James Hong explains that, despite humanity's destruction-deservedness, he's decided to stay behind because he loves them and, what's more, he hasn't found a Chinese girl with green eyes yet.Meanwhile, Kathy Bates acts ignorant, rigid, and heartless in a totally unbelievable way, except that she is supposed to be representing the President and Vice President of the United States, and we all know who they are, so I guess it's OK, right Hollywood? Despite being in scenes where his head appears to be twice the size of Jennifer Connelly's, Jaden Smith is still a kid so I won't say anything bad about his character. It's not like he wrote the part - I mean, c'mon, Billy Ray Cyrus didn't stick around for Miley's whole photo shoot, do ya think Will Smith read the whole script for this turkey? Then again, papa did just star in ""Hancock""... Because it doesn't consider cautiously-approaching forklifts on three sides a threat, G.O.R.T. the cartoon robot gets crated up and sent to a secret military base. There, Kyle Chandler wastes more taxpayer money by wrecking two perfectly good diamond-tipped drills (why try the second time?) before signing G.O.R.T. up to replace Smash on the Dillon Panthers.In the end, Keanu spies an earth-saving display of emotion, something which he apparently didn't hear James Hong mention an hour and fifteen minutes earlier because he was too busy dipping his McNuggets.And so wraps up one of Hollywood's most entertaining remakes. In an attempt to be relatively faithful to the original, they instead created a camp classic. It may not be ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", but it's pretty darn close... and that's not bad.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
261,neacorp,A good movie violated for an actor nobody likes.,1,4 March 2009,"Hollywood ran out of ideas so they decided to recolor old hit films. My prognoses: our grandkids in 50 years will remake this film for home entertainment 3D emitters and it will be no better.The original story ""You have atom bombs. The scared people of space decided to subdue you or blow up your planet. And we don't care if you can't fly beyond your solar system"" for a plot passed for its time. Now this is somewhere between A and B movies. The new plot is basically the same, except Klaatu is late half a century and is edgy to act.The actors all act a terrorist-like movie. They are too emotional to be reasonable. If you aren't in the mood (or a liberal) when you see this, simple logical questions will start popping in to your head. Why assemble all scientists in the epicenter of the crash to brief them before evacuating? Why think that you can survive something so big and traveling so fast? When ET gets shot, what good will the human medic or doctor be? You'd think they would have a bulletproof space suit  micrometeorites are no laughing matter. Once again US takes the role of world leaders (enraging everybody else) and never give up their pride to except that they got nothing to through at the alien force. You'd think US would be reasonable? Try to gather info before becoming utterly deaf paranoid to work out a short-term deal and get some alien tech to fortify Earth? No, they go extremely paranoid as if fighting regular terrorist with a nuke. Will anybody be interested in catching an escaped convict when an UFO is parked in New York Park and nobody knows what will happen? Why go Chinese with subtitles and then go English when nobody relay cares what two aliens are talking about? If another person knowing Chinese were to pass by, would he care? You'd thing Gort would react to being boxed? And so on, and so on. Oh it makes my head hurt and that's the first half of the movie.The second half went its own separate way, throwing away all good that was in the old film, to replace it with a ""end of the world"" religious parody. It became tiresome to watch. The nanites had some entertainment, but that did little to help a dieing movie. Things stopped making sense. No nukes were launched, so no human EMP was used to stop them. What does ""I can't risk the survival of one planet for the sake of one species"" even mean? What do you need Erath for? A botanic garden to neglect for a millennia or two? You guys never heard of terraforming and colonization?! How did these aliens even become so powerful without those two skills? Oh the Gods, no sense at all.I wanted to see this movie as to find out what happened in the first. Well, I was disappointed from the start, and then I was tortured with an even lamer than any 50s plot. The original message ""be pacifists"" was rejected for something illogical. Oh the horror.

I have not seen the original from 1951 and have not read the short story from Harry Bates. And by the way, in the mean time I found out, that the 1951 version also was not too true to the short story. On the other hand, I have the need as well to sometimes being able to hold on to the things I have seen that I have appreciated beyond my usual appreciation. To me the most important message from this movie was the fact that we can change, as soon as we are on the edge of almost not being able to change at all whilst having the absolute need to change. This may not have been the intention of this movie. Still, consider it a marvelous spin off. As far as I can be considered a fan of anyone, I could be considered to be a fan of Keanu (ever since ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure""). People who perceive that he does not show emotion are blind. Especially in this movie he shows the kind of emotion that totally fits the persona of Klaatu ... someone who is on a mission and needs to fulfill a target, while at the same time staying open to changes and with a totally clear manifestation of his own dilemma. To me, the kind of dilemma he faces can only be faced with a face (and posture) like that!",The Day the Earth Stood Still
265,alr126,A less than mediocre remake,4,26 April 2009,"I have to start off by stating that many of the characters were so unlikeable. The worst of the bunch was jade Smith. What a little creep, kill him, etc., that's all he kept ranting about, kill him, that's what my dad would do. I personally would have killed him out of the script. The usual unlikeable Earthlings, starting with the shooting of Klatatu, then the whole power we Americans have, we are the most powerful beings in the universe, uhhh, okay sure. I thought Kathy Bates did a standard job as a standard unlikeable political figure. All that being said, I think that once again Hollywood has depended on special affects to wow the viewer and draw our attention away from the lack of acting ability.

If only Steven Spielberg or Jerry Bruckheimer had decided to make this movie, it would've approached new heights. I had expected to to see something better or equivalent to War of the Worlds, but sadly it wasn't even near it. The beginning made no sense, the alienish egg shell containing Keanu didn't make any sense. The Giant Robot looked like an action figure made bigger on a camera. There wasn't really any need for Jayden Smith, but since they had decided to cast this kid they shud've made the plot into his benefit. All this potential went to waste.

Click...what was that, eh wait a minute: Do they have real actors in Hollywood, i mean those who are master of their business ? If so why ruin a movie why a good potential to be at least an acceptable 'remake' or new point of view of a classic, by casting the completely wrong actors for every role in this movie.Jennifer Connelly overacting by playing her only stereotype of a delicate intelligent and whiny woman, plagued by the incomprehension of the rest. Jeez, can she play anything else ? Connelly seems so narcissistic and arrogant.The Smith kid Jaden, what a spoiled arrogant pita. Not enough that he lives with the golden spoon in his mouth, no, he is casted for big screen movies because his daddy said: you want to be an actor? fine! You can be whatever you want to be.But he probably forgot to tell him, that he has not the talent for everything he wants to be and that what the producers of the movie forget too. Jaden as the gutsy gutsy factor was a total mistake.And Keanu Reeves, he could have played an alien felling uncomfortable in the human body but willing to endure that state of suffering because of fulfilling his mission. BUT, Mr. Reeves, playing an electro-static-toaster is not roughly the same of the job Michael Rennie did 57 years ago.Besides the terrible cast, Scott Derrickson did a decent job to ruin the movie with his 'talent' and ideas.Nowadays, good quality CGI is not a matter of technical equipment, its a matter of ability. What amateurs designed Gort ? Nanobots looking like blowflies...etc. These creatives should have watched the original movie some times more, just to get some inspiration.Do not watch this movie if you liked the original.

270,ven2s,Nice on the Small Screen; see it if you're a fan of the original.,7,12 December 2008,"First off, if you are a fan of the original, like me, you will see this movie in spite of all the good or bad reviews. It is a different take on the original while dealing with much of the same themes; namely,our tendency to destroy ourselves, others and everything. What I found fascinating was the film's take on the character of Klaatu, which seemed more realistic and more alien than the original. Also, I liked the reason for the the visitation...which, like the original, was not the conventional invasion theme. Unfortunately, this central reason, which lies at the core of the film, has been so frequently preached, that I felt it was basically lost on the choir. But if you can bear that and go along for the ride, I think you will enjoy it. Like the recent X-Files film, seen on a big screen, the CGI flaws and lack of big whiz bang special effects, will be very apparent and the film will seem more remote. But a smaller-artsy-screen (20'X 50')seems to make it easier to connect with; for this reason, I have a feeling that it will be a cult classic once it hits the DVD and large flat screen TV viewing crowd.The movie could have done more character development and been much more complex, for our times.

277,VickiHopkins,The Movie Stood Still,4,4 May 2014,"All right, I'll fess up. I was born in 1950. The earth stood still in 1951. As a child, I often watched the reruns of this movie on TV, which scared the bejeebers out of me. Burned into my psyche are the words we must utter, should Gort return to earth.KLAATU BARADA NIKTO! The classic sentence of instruction spoken by Patricia Neal have gone down in history. It's almost as classic as Rhett Butler telling Charlotte, ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn!"" Fast forward to 2008 and the Hollywood remake of The Day the Earth Stood still. If you are going to try and remake a film, don't destroy the original story. As much as I like Keanu Reeves, it was a train wreck (or flying saucer crash) that could have been so much better with today's nifty technology.When producers remake movies and tinker with the classic storyline, it's a sure sign that nothing good can come of it. Let's face it. Fans do not like to be tinkered. Perhaps those who have never seen the 1951 version thought the 2008 version was okay. The spaceship lands (a globe rather than a saucer), Gort and the alien emerges. Gort is basically the same (except he is naked compared to the '51 version that puts briefs on him), but the alien is not in human form. After shooting the poor thing, they discover it's encased in some kind of gooey bio suit, which eventually turns his alien body into a human body. Weird.The modern day Helen Benson is played by Jennifer Connelly, who once again finds sympathy for the strange visitor and ends up driving him all over the town and into the woods at his every command. Turn here - turn there - he's a walking GPS. It's obvious, the alien in this movie isn't too keen on kids either.The premise of the 2008 version is based on our environmental destruction of the planet. Mankind has been a bad caretaker of our resources, so the plan from other life forms in the universe is to destroy mankind before it destroys the earth. Let's face it, there isn't enough habitable planets to go around! The terra firma and oceans are more important than the human life our orb sustains.Compared the the cold-war mentality of the 1951 version, mankind can't get along with one another. War after war has told the other races of the universe that humans are barbaric in nature and a threat to the empire's peace. (Well, you get what I mean.) We have not evolved. Therefore, we need to shape up, or Gort-like beings will wipe us out and turn our blue ball into one of cinder. In other words, we will be eliminated and not assimilated. Even the Borg won't save us.The new version touches here and there on the old, but the message of why the visit is altered into a modern-day tale of our environmental woes, rather than our human woes. Last I looked, the wars and our barbaric condition haven't changed much since we dropped the bomb in WWII. It's a different kind of cold war now, but the message received with the new version weakens the premise of the movie, along with the other changes.Reeves' portrayal of Klaatu gave me the impression that the alien was an emotionless being intent on pursuing his mission. Even another alien from his species, who has been living among us (gasp), has learned to love humans; but Klaatu just doesn't get it. Michael Rennie's Klaatu from 1951 film exhibited more emotion and understanding, than hardheartedness of the new one.So, does the 2008 version deserve any accolades? Well, had the technology of today been used to spiffy up the 1951 version, it would have rocked. If the story would have continued to the original storyline, it would have skyrocketed to better reviews. I'm here to say that the 2008 version will dissolve into oblivion, because it has been devoured by tiny bugs of retribution for not staying true to the original. Hollywood, you didn't listen the day the earth stood still!KLAATU BARADA NIKTO! The failsafe words that halts Gort from doing us all in.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Enough with the black suit and tie already. The reason for this is so you'll think about The Matrix whenever you're considering buying a ticket to one of his movies. Well, the Matrix films are over and Keanu Reeves sucks. He makes terrible films and he's paid lots of money to do so. He doesn't care if they're good or not. And ever since Matrix Reloaded his films have all been bad. He's fooled me for the last time.Do people even read scripts before putting millions of dollars into them? I guess not. This one is full of mistakes. I won't go into all of them because they're listed in the other reviews here. Nothing makes much sense and nothing is even remotely entertaining. Jennifer Connely is the step-mom of that evil kid? Why would she even want that little whining mean spirited bastard around her in the first place? Her husband was a soldier/engineer and was killed and/or died? Why is this unnecessary background story so complicated? This movie is so left-wing they couldn't even say Connely's dead husband was a soldier. He had to be an engineer! Why was the U.S. portrayed as hostile? Another save the planet from humans environmentalist wacko story? Who made this liberal- minded movie, MSNBC and Al Gore? There is nothing funnier than when Reeves is asked his name and he says KLAATU. What a moron. I've written too much about this garbage. Do not spend your time and money on it.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

280,crazychap,"Watchable, but there's no ""Klaatu barada nikto""",5,13 December 2008,"In recent years, remakes of all sorts have been the rage, and Hollywood's originality seems to be dwindling. If you can include Psycho, the Omen, Halloween, and the upcoming Death Wish, Friday the 13th and Elm Street remakes, I think you'll see what I mean. And this one is no exception.To be fair, This remake of the 1951 masterpiece is not a terrible film. I've seen worse movies such as Robocop 3, Superman IV or even the Psycho and House of Wax remakes, but I've seen better things, too.Any way: The intro looks promising, the special effects are good, and it's nice to see the robot from the original make an appearance in this one. Jennifer Conelly and Kathy Bates (Defence Secretary here) keep the human factor alive, but Jaden Smith is awkwardly cast and not credible; Keanu Reeves, while colourless and robotic in many of his other movies, is still put to good use here. However, The story line is confusing; it uses the concept of global warming as a backdrop rather then the atom bomb of the original, but it is treated upon so lightly the message becomes lost as the film progresses. The idea is good, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. John Cleese makes a nice cameo as the genius professor, but where is the ""Klaatu barada nikto"" cathprase?I haven't seen the original in a long time, so I cannot make any effective, deep comparisons for the moment, but from what I remember, it was definitely better than this one in most aspects save the effects. Overall, it's a forgettable OK movie because it's neither dreadful like the films of the MST3K alumni nor is it a masterpiece like Star Wars or Close Encounters.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
281,BruddanChrist,A soon-to-be forgotten remake of a timeless classic,5,13 December 2008,"The 2008 version starts off somewhat promising. Unlike the original, there is a build-up to the first encounter with Klaatu, which is sort of effective in eliciting both wonder and fear. It's reminiscent of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Independence Day. It proceeds down a similar path to the original for a while afterward, embellishing a bit in some areas.While Michael Rennie's Klaatu was a complicated character, simultaneously coming off as creepy and trustworthy, Keanu Reeves's Klaatu is hardly more than a robot. He is completely inexpressive and undynamic. There's no way the audience can identify with him, so his fate seems ultimately unimportant. Also, his purpose is largely unclear in this version. He was a messenger in the original; the closest thing he can be related to in this version is a harbinger of death...Which brings me to my biggest complaint with the movie. Robert Wise's version had a clear underlying message to its audience; Scott Derrickson's version doesn't. Though the ""big issue"" that the film deals with has been changed from the nuclear arms race to global warming, it is hardly touched upon. The destruction of the human race is triggered with little more than a few lines of explanation.Not to undermine the efforts of the 1951 classic's film crew, but The Day The Earth Stood Still is a classic because of its message, a message that easily still applies today. Derrickson's version of The Day The Earth Stood Still could have been a marvelous way of touching modern audiences with an old truth. Instead, it focuses more on thrills and special effects. Klaatu would be disappointed...",The Day the Earth Stood Still
282,wolfen244,Liberal Garbage,2,18 October 2013,"Liberal garbage. I enjoyed the robot Gort for a little while though. He was a trip - until he actually had to do something less than 15 seconds into his introduction then he was so worthless compared to the original that I just kept shaking my head in disappointment. The idiotic and completely illogical thing about aliens coming to earth to destroy humanity in order to ""save the planet"" from man-made climate change is as inane as the idiocy of climate change itself. p.u.Then the thing about an emaciated white woman with an obnoxious smart aleck black child is more liberal garbage. I wonder how many reviews even mentioned that part. What is it with liberals that they have to shove things down our throats in order to make a point? In the original Billy Gray was enthusiastic and patriotic. This kid was just annoying though his father was supposedly patriotic but was an engineer not a ground-pounding soldier like in the original. Has to be something other than an 11B (infantry) soldier because liberals don't like the military.2 things I hated about Jennifer Connelly. I hated the fact that I instinctively knew she was going to be in it and I hated the way she did that Jodie-Foster-wonder-look-with-her-mouth-half-open thing to make her seem like she's emotional. If I wanted that I'd opt for Jodie Foster. btw, folks if you really want to see Jennifer Connelly at her incredible best see her performance in the director's cut of Dark City. She was not only entertaining but was soooo beautiful - which is always a nice plus.I will never stop hating that 2-second flash way of filming thing directors do to keep you from losing interest. Sorry but the audience loses interest the moment the story turns to crapola. Back to the story.Instead of just boinking humanity the aliens actually went to the trouble of making a robot that turned into a bunch of miniature building-munching black, flying, metallic, mitosis-acting insects that swarmed and munched everything humanity makes including humanity itself. Instead of going around the block why not just walk across the street? Just kill everyone remotely if they're so advanced and all powerful and oh-so wise about climate change...blah, blah, blah.In the original GORT was a lot of fun at the end. This left-wing movie never let him do anything fun like in the original. Also in the original GORT was pronounced Gaut as they would in New England so for years without the aid of closed captioning I never new it was GORT since New Englanders often drop the r in many words - Pawk the caw in Hawvud Yawd.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

The whole concept is very good but the film lacks about everything. Mainly the actors forgot how to act and the whole situation is not beliavable at all. Especially the situation around the first encounter looks like a B-movie, and it develops like a B-movie. The earths highest command looks really B. The rest of the movie is also like a B-movie.

Unfortunately sometimes films entertain but miss the beat, by that I mean that the continuity that takes us from one scene to another needs to be seamless and not blunt, the scene preceding should somehow explain what is happening or give us the facts or spoon feed if absolutely necessary.The Day The Earth Stood Still is not inherently bad, it suffers because this film assumes that you have already seen the original! Therein lies the problem for the first time viewer. The scenes are knitted together in a fashion that makes it difficult to join the dots in some cases. The dialogue is poor which is a shame because given a good script and better editing this could have been a good film. Perhaps an editors cut version might answer some questions.Keanu Reeves is playing a role not to dissimilar to Neo, however this minimalist portrayal seems to lack something to make Klaatu other than a one dimensional being. Reeves looked to be back on form in Street Kings, this will do little to re-energise his career.All in all this suffers from a bad script and a haze of bad editing.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
285,pauld2b,Restful,4,13 December 2008,"I went there expecting to be disappointed and was. The annoying child. the nicely constructed but plain old silly imagining of GORT( he's apparently a tightly formed nest of space bees) - which was his name - not an ACRONYM . . . yeesh ! I am glad Gort looked basically the same and with proper handling could have been quite a bit more menacing though twice as big as he needed to be. Let me give you a quick review. I went in , loaded down with large popcorn and a 3 quart beverage and found primo seats. Took over the little island of seats (3) with my jacket and soda and was ready to be amazed. Okay? So where was the spaceship ? I didn't want a swirly cloud ball I wanted a freaking space ship. Why wasn't the kid smart and slick and helpful ? ; why was he a spoiled whiny dangerous asexual brat who changed his mind like diapers ? Well I'll tell you why. Because in 2008 that is just the type of kids you get.They sure got that right. But the movie really must have gotten really good because I slept through a solid 30 minutes and when I awoke found I had missed nothing both literally and figuratively. I almost drove 50 miles to see this in IMAX and spent 17 bucks. Believe me 9 dollars was enough of a rip-off.

286,garynorton,The Day We Got Another Half Baked Remake,5,17 December 2008,"The original has dated (unsurprising given the passing of 57 years- especially where Sci-fi had barely found its legs in terms of concepts and fx). The remake fails to correct the originals issues for a modern audience, as well as lacking cohesion and common sense. Why does an alien civilisation- which obviously cares about the environment, right down to the smallest of organisms- lack any emotion? Why have another alien observe and research mankind for 70 years-only to have him right off 6 billion people in a global genocide? All passed onto Keanu's ""Klaatu"" verbally, in a couple of minutes over a coffee in MacDonalds?!! The very same ""observer"" then contradicts himself stating he loves us but can't explain why. Gee, thanks-we were kind of relying on you to convey some serious issues but you are old and feel lucky to be amongst us-just can't be bothered to prevent total Armageddon. I did like the references towards the biblical; Keanu walking on water, the sphere animal ""arks"", the nanabot locust swarms of destruction. However these touches were few and far between. Klaatu has a massive decision to make, but why he needs to ""feel"" anything about the sense of loss that Jennifer Connelly and Jaden Smith have gone through to realise the Earth is worth saving is beyond me! I thought thats what all alien technology and long years of observation and study was for! I also hated the wordless exit of the alien presence-I wanted Klaatu up on his soap box telling it like it is. The director was not going to have a Gort (robot protector) of any kind, but changed his mind during the making. Just as well, otherwise this would have been even less exciting. Also, I don't want to lay into the young boy ,Jaden, (Will Smiths son) but he was awful in this and could only have got this act under ""its not what you know-but who your Dad is"" screen test challenge.....",The Day the Earth Stood Still
287,Frogfisher,Lacks heart and some edge!,5,19 February 2009,"I just saw The Day Earth Stood Still and must admit I have always been fascinated by the title but never saw the original! I try to keep a open mind and since I haven't seen the original I could enjoy it with a fresh mind.One of the main problems with the movie seems to be that it tries to be the old movie and tell the story in the same way. The threat of total destruction of earth because of our ways of life and one person can of course change our faith. The problem is that we know the story, it doesn't present anything new, not only is pretty much the same story told before but we have seen various renders of this story before. And the movie doesn't manage to move out of this, instead of trying to twist things we are fed with a predictable story, one I expect most will have guessed just by seeing the trailer.The story is pretty straight forward. Humanity is to be removed from earth because we are destroying it and the only way to save it is for a earth female to show the ""diplomatic"" alien that human life is worth saving. This isn't easy and extra action has been added by the fact the military and police keep trying to catch the alien. And in the end things are to be done in the last minute(as always) when the world is about to be destroyed by a storm of nano-termites.The story is a critique of our life style and how we treat the earth. I never really got anything else from the story if there was a theme. It might be that humans are unique for our ability to love. Which of course will have a significant role in the end.But the story is told seriously and lacks any warmth and the former mentioned love that is to save us is hardly even treated as a subject, it almost seems like the alien change his mind after a conversion with John Cleeses Scientist character. A role even John Cleese plays serious, but at least less cynical than others characters.Keanu's Klaatu is as with many of Keanu's role almost superficial and shaved down to what looks cool on screen. Jennifer Connelly isn't the most exciting character, Kathy Bates is hard to put a finger on as a character she just plays smarter than the others. And Robert Knepper gets the only sign of humor I remember when he after a failed attack says: ""Any one got any other ideas?"".The whole performance seems to be overshadowed by the ""green"" message and the very convincing effects. And the fact that even in the end it is more about effects than the actual story.The movie also lacks intelligence, something challenging, we are told pretty everything by the characters, and the only interesting aspects I find is the idea of a biological space suit that seem to pull the beginning up! But it never dwells on any of the intelligent interesting aspects of the movie, even John Cleese character explains too much! So the problem as I see it is that the movie doesn't want to be anything other than popcorn entertainment... the green message and the ""uniqueness"" of our ability to love is forgotten in the end when we just want the world to be saved.I gave it 5 only because the effect were really good and that it is okay decent to watch... but I wouldn't have seen it in the cinema!

She (Jennifer Connelly) repeatedly asks what's going on, and is told repeatedly, ""All will be explained en route"". But, you know, that never happens.That kind of sums up my movie-going experience here. This movie tries too hard to do too many things. It tries to respect the expectation of the fans of the original. It tries to update the story from the folly of the Cold War to the folly of environmental destruction. It tries to reconcile the strained relationship between mother and son. And, it tries to be original.It fails on all counts. Even if you accept the inane story line - no spoiler here, it's in the trailer: ""If the Earth dies, you die. If you die, the Earth survives."" Get it? - the script and direction are too weak to pull it off. The CG work is competent and fun to watch. Fans of the first movie may get a kick out of the re-invention of Gort, the robot, with his name finally explained.If you want to watch a great movie, rent the original, oh and make it a double feature with ""Forbidden Planet.""If you want an evening of B-movies that are fun to laugh at, rent this remake along with ""Johnny Mnemonic"".",The Day the Earth Stood Still

It's a real shame too because the way T.D.T.E.S.T remake started out with such promise of something special but 2/3 of the way it fell apart; the message lost, GORT reduced to a Biblical style joke coupled with a muddled ending.

297,TheFilmFreak1,Klaatu Barada Keanu,3,19 November 2013,"1951's 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' was one of the better tales of spacial conflict from an era that was otherwise rather lacking in intelligent sci-fi. Unlike its peers, 'Day' was more of a cautionary tale about nuclear warfare than it was B-grade exploitation. It centred around an alien named 'Klaatu' who came to earth on behalf of a group of alien civilisations to warn mankind that, if we did not cease and desist with our atomic shenanigans, than we would, for lack of a better phrase, be turned into puppy chow.Although some parts of Robert Wise's film have not aged particularly well, such as the awkward Americana and the inexplicable decision of the aliens to land specifically in Washington DC when there are over a hundred different Earth capitals that would surely have offered equally impressive photo opportunities, they're all relatively minor sniggles that ultimately do not detract from the enjoyment of what is a clever, thoughtful, and even occasionally witty piece of Cold-War sci-fi.The same, however, cannot be said for the 'sniggles' I have with the 2008 remake of the film.Forgetting the bland performances, the humdrum special effects, and the prosaic direction, this film still manages to be shockingly bad on the level of how it tackles some of the admittedly interesting ethical conundrums it sets out to explore, mainly because it mistakes its solutions to these problems as foreshadowing an advancement in human evolution when really they just mark the beginning of an arduously prolonged and humiliating end for the species. But even though I love the original, don't think I regard this film with pronounced vitriol just because it isn't an exact replica. I'm perfectly willing to admit that that film had its problems (some of which I outlined above), and I'm even willing to admit that I found Keanu Reeves' Klaatu a lot more interesting than Michael Rennie's take on the character (though I still regard the latter portrayal affectionately), but it's a pretty sad indictment of a film to say that the best thing in it is Keanu Reeves' acting.Also, Jaden Smith might possibly be the worst actor in the history of the world.

I remember seeing this movie for the first time on late night TV at college and the day after there were Gort signs all over campus. It's a signature that stays with anyone who has even seen the original. The signature of the remake -- boredom.It's a stinker with a plot that barely makes sense. Keanu Reeves gives the only decent performance here ... everyone already believes he's an alien. We don't care about the characters ... the major emotion evoked is boredom.

There are reviews out their in the land of the internet that say that his portrait of Klatu was wooden. Which I have to say that it is true. But when you see the whole movie you will come to understand that as an alien that used a human DNA to mix in with the race in order to make a final judgment on the Earth the you will understand why Keanu Reeves made the portrait Klatu as he did. A person that is devoid of emotion and has to get used to the human body as it is apparent early on in the movie.

During the graveyard scene where Klaatu suddenly realizes the goodness in the hearts of some humans you see the little locust things floating over the trees, if they are spreading everywhere then how come the bugs didn't devour them then and there.2. The horrid replies to certain statements like ""The highway's completely empty"", ""They shut it down"", ""They shut it down...for what"", ""For us!"", wow, you'd think a female scientist taking for a ride by the government would have some common sense, and then there's ""It's leaving"", ""No....he's leaving"" Awwwwww.....ain't Jaden Smith so cute when he spouts bad dialogue.3. They stereotyped the crap out of this movie so that the scientists want to help the alien and the government only wishes to blow it up.4.

They gather all these ""expert"" to cope with the aftermath of a large space object collision that is going to devastate the major city its aimed at. So what do they do with these experts? They put them all at ground zero. Then just before the object is due to impact, just in case they might possibly be sheltered by something on the ground between them and the impact, they put them all in helicopters and fly them up just above the impact site at roof level.After this I just couldn't take the movie seriously.Reeves is Reeves. If you've seen him in one movie you've seen him in every movie he's ever done. His style fits the character in this though.Technically it's well done, just a bad script.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

How a politician garners more attention in a black Cadillac espousing what scientists have forewarned for decades is beyond me. Just more evidence that the world just values idiots that know nothing.This movie almost follows the same vain. When will and do people change? How does Jennifer meekly say this twice, like a tape recorder, as if it has meaning? How do people bulls&%# the world for so long and then say on the brink of treating the world like rubbish, WE will change? It makes me feel so stupid. The original movie said the same thing, in a much more poignant fashion, 50 years ago. Has the human race 'changed'? We just make films to convince people that people will change, so we wait for someone to make the first step and just go along with it when the time comes.Nice; very intelligent. Idiots.Has anyone not realized that progression (of intellect, at least) is slowing down? That the human race is doing its best to slow the present economic system to avoid its inevitable destruction? And then what? Oh, right: 'Won't happen in my lifetime, so why should I care?'If we have a different side, why the hell does it not win out in making decisions based on cohesion to build product and services that do not waste so much resources and that VALUE THE EARTH. Economics first until the 11th hour, and then get Al Gore to save the world.What happened to the Gandhi's and King's of this world? And why do such people have to use so much energy to convince those with so much fear, and yet, who are in power? How did George Bush and Mao Zedong get to 'rule' countries if we have a different side? And then, a film like this uses the fundamental aspect of the earth standing still as an afterthought before the main sphere takes off. How did that happen?

In the past, I have been successful avoiding updated versions of classic movies, just to save me from disappointments, but this time I felt like falling in.I was prepared to see much more spectacularity in this 2008 version, the regular special effects, and maybe something new in the script.And yes, there was some new things in the script. A rather inconsistent start, The Cold War is still there, plus the global warning, and maybe the toxic assets. There's also a reference to the altruism enigma.The rest is purely crap.We miss the evangelistic references of the 1952 version. There's no Jude and there's no mortality in Klaatu's enigmatic persona. Instead, he's a rather flat and expressionless superhero, able to control people's mind remotely or bring down helicopters with his hands. No thrill.The rest of the cast ranges from stupid to useless characters. The kid is really hard to stand, and the Secretary Defense is unbelievable. Even the heroin looks little smart despite her academic titles, and there's this pain of watching John Cleese trying to act seriously.But, over all, there you have this gigantic hole in the script. After almost destroying New York (yes, just recovered from the recent havoc of Watchmen!) and lots of stadiums, trucks and the like, Klattu surrenders to rather poor mortal mercy demands, and leaves the planet.Probably then, Klaatu just forgot the movie's name, and sends a command to freeze the whole Earth machinery pool. But... Why does he need to demonstrate his strength with a global warning when he just almost destroyed the planet? Is like sending a newsreel with Los Alamos footage to Hiroshima the 9th of August, 1945. Purely crap. Nonsense crap.Luckily, we still have the 1952 version.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
306,critic_w,A Simple Review of a Simple Problem in Hollywood...,4,14 December 2008,"The Day The Earth Stood Still remake is a poor movie and a terrible remake. Forgive me, since I just wasted nearly two hours watching it I have not the patience to spend more than 10-minutes warning others.Judged on it's own, it's merely slow, stupid, and uneventful (with some weak performances thrown in for good measure). Judged in comparison to the 50s classic, it essentially lets you down in every possible area. To wit, the original had The Cool Ship, The Impressive Giant Robot, The Deep Message and, oh, the Earth Standing Still! The remake blows every last one of those, even the Earth standing still is less effectively done and seemingly without purpose, which brings me to my original point. Hollywood has forgotten how to tell a good story! They've forgotten that a good story must have purpose and some believability and reason and that we need to care about somebody or something. Mark my words, if the industry is to be saved, they need help from someone who can read a script like this and ask intelligent questions; questions like: What's the purpose in the kid being so bratty? Who shot Klaatu and what triggered it? How can we believe that the US has the equipment & technology to move something like Gort, and why did we develop it (for the previous 50ft killer robot)? Why would the Secretary of State (or did she say Defense) just follow orders to attack Klaatu when she knows they've exhausted everything and gotten nowhere? Why would a civilization as advanced as Klaatu's need to have a face-to-face at a McDonalds? Why didn't the we see the UN convene over this world crisis? And the kicker for me: Why wouldn't Helen (Connely's character) have called the Secretary (Kathy Bates) and told her this simple and vital sentence: ""If any harm comes to Klaatu we are doomed, he's the only one who can stop the swarm of destructo-bugs."" If they could clear the highway for her to at the beginning of the movie, wouldn't they do at least that to save all humanity!

307,tetractys,Spoiler -- Giant robot fails to take out 20th Century Fox ... pity,3,8 August 2010,"Went to see the Keanu Reeves version of The Day the Earth Stood Still, which was a big mistake. This has to be the worst movie made in the last ten years, and is simply awful. I'd like to go through the DVD and document the hundred ways it's bad, but why devote time to detailing the many reasons why compost attracts flies? Here are two: In the beginning, a bunch of scientists are talking about how fast the UFO is traveling, and they say, ""It's going 20 times 10 to the 6th kilometers per second."" What rubbish. Scientists don't speak scientific notation when the numbers are so commonly low. They'd say, ""It's going 20 million kilometers per second."" Item two -- the robot (hilariously encased in a secure facility built underneath him overnight) is probed with a ""diamond drill."" In real life a diamond drill is a drill bit with diamond dust glued to the cutting surface. This was a BIG DIAMOND, cut like a ring, spinning in what looked like a jackhammer. Bonus item #3 -- apparently the entire movie is poorly-done CGI, like it was drawn by an art student who couldn't afford all the colors, or a pencil sharpener. The original movie had a great premise -- mankind threatened other civilizations because we are violent and beginning to travel outside Earth's orbit. This movie has a premise that is patently ridiculous -- we threaten Earth with our pollution, so the aliens will kill everything with nanobots, thereby destroying ... Earth. Presumably, evolution will start over. Since it's starting from a different point, who's to say it won't evolve into a Garden of Crud? Only good thing about the new world ... this movie probably won't be in it.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Not only that, but I have also purchased an LG mobile phone, a Citizen watch, a Honda car, and some desktop computer thingy by Microsoft.Seriously filmmakers.. product placement in big budget films is offensive. If you're going to have sponsors, the film should be free to watch.There is a saying along the lines of ""where commerce grows, art and culture die on the vine"".. and that was definitely true here.The film lost credibility for me when the camera lovingly caught the reflection of the golden arches in the windscreen, and Jennifer Connolly refrained ""McDonalds?""

What's sad is the movie had potential but turned into a typical Hollywood political stance.The scene at the drawing board when after a few senseless scribbles mankind suddenly discovers that..... I don't want to commit a spoiler, so I will just say, if I heard 'that' one more time I was turning this disaster off and I did.As to the acting it wouldn't be fair to criticize the actors, except maybe accepting their role, because there was nothing to really grab hold of.

Macdonald's seminal novel, so does this one, starring Jennifer Connelly and Keanu Reeves creatively flesh-out the set pieces depicted in the classic 1951 rendition with Michael Rennie and Patricia Neal.It isn't merely a matter of enhanced computer generated special effects: Keanu Reeves delicately walks a thespian tightrope between terrifying godlike powers and an overriding mission dedicated to persuading an earth on a collision course with its own self perpetuating doom---to help itself before it is too late.As a matter of taste, any work of art may be alternately extolled or parodied; ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is no exception. However, as a devotee of world peace and a believer in the ability of united enlightened irenic and compassionate human beings, I was heartened by this cinematic presentation. I think that Michael Rennie and those who produced the 1951 version might also be cheered---especially in light of the Hitleresque antics of Vladimir Putin, Assad and Kim Il and others in our times. No well intentioned effort to eradicate rampant, destructive, vengeful, revanchist maniacal demagogues- is a waste of time.

312,mexicospidergreen,Since when did big budget movies start to be crappy?,2,18 December 2008,"Keanu Reeves plays an alien who has come to stop a pending attack on our universe in The Day the Earth Stood Still. This is yes another remake of the 1950's original. Basically this is just the original only with color and more talented performers. Reeves plays Klattu, an alien who has been sent to Earth, to destroy the human race. To sum it up if the humans die the earth survives but if they survive the earth dies. Since humans have not been taking care of their planet, Klattu is sent to destroy it. He meets a doctor and a child on his visit who tries to get him to change his mind but by then it might be already too late. This remake starts off interesting, but soon becomes very crappy. The cast including the always terrific Jennifer Connelly (Blood Diamond), Oscar Nominee Kathy Bates and Will Smith's son Jaden Smith (who you might recognize from Pursuit of Happiness) are all well casted but even they can't save this movie. On the positive side, this does make you wonder if we are doing too much damage to the environment or not. All of that said, sadly this movie is pretty crappy. The characters weren't believable; it'll make you laugh when it's supposed to be serious, and has action we've seen in over a billion better sci-fi movies. I just couldn't relate this movie, and that's always a bad thing. However there are some near special effects and the performance from Jayden Smith actually saved me from giving this a 1/10.

313,john-70-690278,Rubbish from start to finish,2,21 October 2015,"I've seen this film a couple of times and that's more than enough. I've probably seen the original a dozen times and I'll happily watch it again. The difference between the 2 films is very simple - the first was good and this remake is rubbish.Special effects, dramatic music and a few explosions can never compensate for a poorly scripted, poorly directed and poorly acted storyline, and a film full of implausible and unexplained nonsense. The ludicrously aggressive and jingoistic vice president is a parody, as are the arrogant military types who pop up from time to time. The gaggle of scientists that's brought together at the start seems to be pretty much superfluous to the rest of the story, as it's only the good looking girl (surprise, surprise !) who plays any prolonged part. The utterly unnecessary child is, presumably, included for box office reasons only, as his part could have been equally well played by a furry animal. As a whole, it's hard to imagine what audience this was made for, or what audience it would appeal to.As others have written before, the characters have no warmth and engender no sympathy. They all seem to be doing little more than 'going through the motions'. Indeed, if I were Klaatu, I'd want to wipe them all out too.I suppose that one day, someone will make a good film, one with a sensible story, good script, good direction and real acting, and without the special effects, flashy cinematography, constantly shifting scenes and portentous music.

316,svetlastoyanova,when did that happened,4,26 December 2008,"I haven't seen the original film but that remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still is a bit shallow. The special effect are really good, no question about it. The acting is considerably good , but the plot itself is so bleak the characters look a bit lost and uncoordinated. Keanu Reeves is very authentic as the alien Klaatu, but then we have already seen them big pretty eyes.I did like the message and I bet all environmentalists did too, ""Planet die, you die. You die, planet lives."" What a better way to tell someone they are not wanted. With that thought in mind Jennifer Connely's biologist have to convince Klaatu to stop the apocalypse. The only sensible conversation in the whole movie was the one at the professor's house, about us being on the brink of self-destruction is when we are going to change our ways in order to survive. Simple, logical, pure genius.Then onwards was just a chase with time and so obviously inevitable saving of the world, because Klaatu has seen that there is more to people than meets the eye. The reasons the characters follow and their behaviour is a bit arbitrary not to say illogical. Klaatu too, first so powerful and determined; later a bit confused; and at the end so incapable to finish what he came for or to stop it for that matter. It is a good message about how we should really try and save the planet while we still can but it is a really bad reason why we should be saved.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
317,action-man101,Another remake....,5,21 January 2009,"Big budget remake of the classic 50's original gets a typically eco-friendly make-over which seems to be all the rage at the moment in this brave attempt. This film is not without its merits, chief amongst them Jennifer Connolly's performance, a nifty-looking Gort and a decent build up to the alien arrival. However the minuses sadly outweigh the plusses. The main culprit is the wooden Keanu Reeves. His performance as Klaatu suffers the most in comparison to the original version when he was played by class and compassion by the enigmatic Michael Rennie. Reeves' ""acting"" as never been up to par but here he looks like he's bored and constipated. The whole point of the screenplay is a warning to Earth to mend its ways, in the 1951 version it was to stop our atomic and nuclear programs as our war-like tendencies threatened other species in the galaxy. Klaatu did this by showing the power at his disposal and at the same time not harming a single living thing. Here, its to get us to recycle more. Perhaps Al Gore should've played Klaatu? After all he's won an Oscar! Oh and a few people get killed along the way to emphasise his point, including some innocent truck driver (?) However Reeves' poor performance was nearly overshadowed by the annoying little boy and his hilarious dreads? Was the hair and make up artist having a laugh? In their scenes together I didn't know what to laugh at first!

318,FabD1,Disappointing,5,10 December 2008,"Let's be blunt: this is definitely not a good movie; it's not horrid either, it's just somewhere between average and bad. There are quite a few problems. First, with the script, which tries to incorporate all elements of the 1951 movie into a new, updated whole. The end result lacks cohesion and plays more like a sequence of 5 to 10 minutes scenes badly sewn together, the prime objective of each scene being either to introduce an element taken from the original movie or, on the contrary, an idea absent form the1951 original, instead of simply advancing the story. Second, the direction: poor, poor, poor. Third, some of the worst acting I have seen in a mainstream movie for a long time; I found the leads, especially Keanu, quite good but the other actors are decent at best, with Katie Bates delivering a frighteningly catastrophic 'performance'. I was not shocked (positively or negatively) by all the other aspects of the film.Coming out of the theater, I found myself pondering about this remake and the 1951 original. I find the Robert Wise movie quite good, but not the masterpiece some claim it to be. I was therefore ready to accept a remake and the few new ideas offered by the 2008 movie made me painfully aware that a remake could indeed have been interesting, had it been put in better hands or, if I dare say so, in much better hands. So, to me, it's another sadly missed opportunity.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
319,jfwhelan,A Story Without a Plot,4,16 February 2009,"The original was impressive and still has merit today, so it is easy to see why a remake seemed so enticing. The trouble seems to have been one of maintaining a relevant and coherent plot.In the original the premise that our race was dangerous to ourselves and ultimately others made sense within the context of the story, but We, as a race, have moved on from that point and nuclear destruction is a less meaningful plot; so the central premise has been changed to the environment and this is, I would posit, the downfall of this movie.That we inflict harm on our own planet is to the detriment of ourselves and the other creatures that share our planet, it in no way affects other civilisations. Even if one accepts Klaatu's glib statement that there are very few worlds capable of supporting complex life, this is still not a reason for what Klaatu is planning to do. Time and evolution will take care of our suicidal short-sightedness and in the scheme of this planet we are as much a natural disaster as 'Snowball Earth', the end of the Dinosaurs or the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period.The film would have us believe that Klaatu is some sort of galactic creationist who believes that the damage we do is permanent and that there can be no further evolution or change. This is of course unsupportable and unbelievable even within the context of the movie.Micheal Rennie's Klaatu was complex and multi-layered with a clear an moral raison d'etre; Keanu Reeves' Klaatu is almost robotically devoid of any complexity with an amoral ill-defined purpose - rather than being a messenger of hope and reason, he comes across as one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse. Whereas Micheal Rennie's Klaatu could and did take the moral high-ground, in this version we have an amoral alien learning reason and morality from us. This ill-conceived turnabout removes any kind of purpose from the story: a story without a plot, as it were!What we are left with is a shell of a movie: technically well crafted; reasonable, when not cheesy, special effects; good sound and occasionally very good photography.Without a plot the story cannot sustain, the acting has no meaning and the experience is flat an uninvolving. I am left believing that the original was of its time and quite simply did not allow a contemporary remake.I have to conclude that it would have been better if this film had not been made.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Being that said, there are a number of plot holes understandable in the original pulp written in the forties, but not allowable in a year that is beyond the, for that time, far away future of the year 2000.

327,Geekofriendly,Full of flaws...but the movie's message ain't one of them.,7,14 December 2008,"""The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008)"", a painfully misunderstood remake, is not quite the generic disaster I (as countless others) was expecting fro H-wood. Instead, I got a surprising and mildly effective slap in the face, and while the movie's message should have and easily could have(!) struck a stronger chord with the masses (like ""WALL-E"" managed), I fear it will be, sadly, silenced by harsh and unjust criticism, which in most cases surprisingly sees it as an inadequate remake of the 1951 movie. Undeservingly so, and I hope I can make my case...Whereas the second half of ""WALL-E"" touched upon the subject of human negligence and thoughtless dependence on technology, it's first half also showed our planet in a state that somehow doesn't seem nearly as far fetched as it would have 20 or 30 years ago.This movie gives its perspective on this disaster. Sure, it's total sci-fi, but that shouldn't steer away from the actuality of our current problems. I'm no fundamental environmentalist, nor do I buy into the C02 craze because of a couple of charts, but what I definitely do see is the rapid demise of nature around us, in all shapes, forms, and sizes. If you disagree, here's where we should probably part ways.If not, let me conclude my review by mentioning the recurring and symbolic consistencies that are present in both the 1951 movie and this (almost justifiable) remake, although most viewers seem to have missed them and bash this movie for reasons of pure nostalgia. Both movies came out in a time of global panic (the brink of cold war/global warming and natural disasters), both movies have more or less the same story-line, which is heavy on the symbolic (alien comes to warn the humans of their future actions regarding this panic. If he succeeds nobody knows and only time will tell), and both movies crudely, yet effectively, present this message to the viewer. The 1951 movie is retrospectively regarded as one of the more powerful and inspirational movies of its time, and looking back, how can we not see these attributes. This 2008 version definitely lacks the nostalgic sparkles, could have used a more polished script and some better thought-out scenes and casting options (Keanu is surprisingly not one of them, Connelly neither), but is in its core a very powerful movie, much more than it will get credit for! Had it been given into the hands of a more experienced director who would have relied more on human interaction than on generic CG, and had it been freed of the curse of being a remake for the sake of a warmer critical reception (which, although I am totally against remakes, I HAVE TO make an exception in this case, solely on the symbolic and historic relevance both movies carry), well...Whatever the outcome, I hope that future generations will indeed look back on this movie, and see it as the shouting expression of events, occurring in the beginning of the 21st century. But what if our Earth does decide to stand still somewhere along the way?",The Day the Earth Stood Still

That said, I'm sure that if I had gone in hoping for greatness I would have been soundly disappointed.The 1951 movie of the same name is a classic, and rightly so. It was a cheesy sci-fi flick that nobody believed would be a success, but it tapped into the zeitgeist with imagery and thematic content that still resonates today. An indestructible robot that exists only to keep the peace; a fatherless child who teaches an intergalactic messenger about humanity; a physicist who speaks of the potential of culture and science; a man from beyond who is killed out of fear and ignorance and who, resurrected, delivers a way forward for all humankind. The original film emerged from the context of the nuclear cold war, which at the time was in its earliest stages. The message brought from beyond was: Destroy yourselves if you wish, but we will not tolerate you bringing your violence to the galaxy.(Beware spoilers beyond this point.)The remake, featuring Keanu Reeves in the role he was born to play (an alien who moves stiffly and speaks woodenly), translates the ""intergalactic messenger"" motif into our context, replacing the nuclear threat with the environmental one. But in the remake, Klaatu is not a messenger but a judge - and it is here that it fails to capture the ominous tone of the original. Instead of delivering an ultimatum, Klaatu's job is to decide for or against the survival of the human race. And instead of protecting the peace, GORT (the aforementioned robot) has the job of annihilating all humanity - thus allowing the biosphere of Earth a chance to start over without our destructive influence.The result of these thematic shifts is a condescending preachiness. The message is good - share the globe, protect the biosphere, conserve the planet, be peaceful and constructive - but the tone has an ""or else"" implied that leaves a sour taste. Let's not forget that in 1951 we were left with three options: destroy ourselves, live peacefully, or be destroyed. In 2008 that has been reduced to two: do what's right or cease to exist. And that is substantially less satisfying as a message.On the positive side, the acting is good. Reeves basically does what he always does, but with this character it actually works well. Jennifer Connelly, Kathy Bates, John Cleese, Jon Hamm, Jaden Smith, and Kyle Chandler all hold up their ends. The reactionary violence of the government and military is generally well-played, and the troubled relationship between the young boy (Smith) and his step-mother (Connelly) is a nice sub-plot that provides Klaatu with a window into human psychology. The climactic destruction wreaked by GORT is also new and impressive, as he transforms himself into nano-disassemblers that begin destroying the works of humankind.Finally, I found the ending disappointing. The human population in general is left without any closure - they have faced a crisis and had it averted, but they have not been provided with an interpretation of it. This unresolved ambiguity - fashionable these days - was unsatisfying in the way it was done in this film. Much more effective would have been a brief message from Klaatu, providing a way forward and a reminder that the intergalactic civilizations will be watching. Thus, the unresolved ambiguity becomes whether people will reform their ways or not. As it is, the possibility remains that humanity will not even understand what has happened to them and therefore have no vision for change.Overall, the remake didn't add much to the original except some improved effects. If you want to have a good time at the movies, you could do worse than DTESS '08. If you want to see a great, important, influential movie, you should probably stick with DTESS '51.6/10",The Day the Earth Stood Still
329,tonywebman,don't listen to the dumb-ass critics who trash this movie,8,16 April 2009,"I'm getting really tired of having to wade through the piles of self-promoting crap that people on the IMDb leave nowadays in the guise of a review. I just read a review on this movie by a guy who wrote paragraph upon paragraph of bullshit about how lousy this movie was and then signs it at the bottom (not forgetting to type in his middle name) with a link to his website. (And the site is down by the way.) Everybody is entitled to their opinion, alright, but don't trash a movie when you clearly are either A) only doing it so that you can practice some form of cerebral masturbation or B) don't get it at all.Yes this is a remake and I think it was a damn good one! It took the ideas from the original and adapted it to today's political, social and environmental climates. That's what a good remake does. It doesn't copy it imitates, there's a difference.Some people say that the message in the movie is heavy-handed. If the world wasn't full of pollution, War, Famine, and Death... if the Earth weren't dying because of us, I might agree. But seriously, you've got to be kidding. Heavy-handed? Jeezus! It's not heavy enough! I suppose that some could view this as propaganda by the peace-mongering, tree-huggers who care about the future of mankind... but I digress. This is first an action/sci-fi popcorn movie with a pretty serious theme. It also has just the right mix of suspense and intrigue to keep it intellectually interesting as well as lots of CGI effects to keep it visually exciting.I thought the acting was good; Keanu Reeves played the part as well as anyone could. He's an alien who views the human race as a cancer that needs to be treated. (Isn't there some irony here as that is what Agent Smith said to Morpheus in the first Matrix?) He's suppose to act indifferent and almost a little bored. He can because he holds all the cards.The bottom line is if you like a movie with topical social commentary, lots of action and special effects, aliens and cool, out-of-this-world technology as well as a good plot and good acting then check it out.no name, no website",The Day the Earth Stood Still
330,wildwesth,The Mummy Meets Gort,6,17 May 2009,"First let me say that this film is, on its own, very watchable, and if you liked the original 'The Day The Earth Stood Still' you will also like this film: a fine ""you should also see"" B film.In its construction it pays homage to the X-Files, War of The Worlds, Close Encounters of the Third Kind (which also payed homage to the original 'Day the Earth Stood Still') and the Andromeda Strain. I think it's a little unfair to compare this to the original, since that film was and is a masterwork, a classic, probably one of the top 50 films ever made.SPOILER PARAGRAPH 1 - WARNING But here we have another movie: A being left here 70 years ago now reports the result of his study: humanity will not turn back its destruction of the earth. So few planets can support life, that the decision is made, remove samples of all the animals, then raze the earth of all human beings and destroy the surface in order to repopulate and rebuild the earth later. But How can you respect the earth and not the strange and messy beauty of all its races?SPOILER PARAGRAPH - WARNING In the original film, the decision was NOT made to destroy the earth, but to put in place a system of security and justice which would be triggered, not immediately on a global scale, but through the use of robots surgically as needed, based on human behavior. That film, in many ways, is much more sophisticated in its message and in the implied technology, than this film, which creates a black and white decision - destroy the human race now or not. The problem with this script line is that it is not the line the film starts with. At first, Klatu wants to speak to all the world's leaders. That is the only justification for landing his craft right in the middle of New York City, and he states as much.Clearly he is starting out with a plan to provide humanity with a way out. But as his intentions are frustrated, Klatu changes his mind for the worse in choosing to destroy the Earth. That decision weakens the entire flow of the film, makes Klatu's judgment fairly plastic and immature, and greatly demeans the ethic of the aliens. In the first film, the aliens deliver a message, a warning, but the decision is left to humankind. In this film, the decision is made by the aliens, making them no better than intellectual huns, taking what they want as spoils (the species they abscond with) and destroying everything else. The original film's protagonist never varied from his purpose, nor his conviction that as badly as he was treated, the human race will always have the decision - it will never be taken from them. They will now be responsible for the consequences, that is all. The original Klatu had an ethic much higher, much more sophisticated than this remake. I fear it is the filmmakers themselves who did not truly understand what the original film was about nor this ethic Wise and North communicated so remarkably in the poetry of science fiction. Robert Wise has always attempted to do so in all of his fine films: 'Day the Earth Stood Still', 'Andromeda Strain', and 'Star Trek - the Motion Picture', even 'The Sound of Music'.SPOILER PARAGRAPH The remake bends the story line to pursue an Apocalyptic theme, and a more personal vision. Klatu is not much different than the rest of us after all. He can change his mind, he can be very wrong, and he can also learn on the brink of a disaster. And that is why he decides to save humanity. SPOILER PARAGRAPH Klatu brings an Apocalyptic swarm of locusts to destroy the world. Using the Mummy films' special particle effects for scenes of destruction was not terribly impressive, if only because we have seen that very effect so very often over the last ten years. However, it makes Klatu look like the Mummy unleashing his sand storm - a very bad visual association, and the director should have spotted it. In the original, Klatu's ship was light, gleaming, and he was a mixture of threat and enlightenment. Gort was the same - not a dark weapon of death, but a servant to preserve peace. Here, both spaceship and robot are dark, veiled.SPOILER PARAGRAPH 5 In a way Klatu's initial decision is an indictment on his own race. Do they have no sophisticated means of helping a younger race mature? Must they kill their own young? If we have failed, so has he. This is where the film becomes less interesting. Klatu offers no higher morality, and no way to get there. In the original, Lt Cmdr. John Carpenter (monogrammed initials JC - in reference to another carpenter - Jesus Christ) sacrifices himself to deliver a message of higher ethics and behavior - Earth is about to join the interplanetary neighborhood and must enter it as a brotherhood.Films like the original are rare - daring to enlighten and entertain. But at least in this remake you are not spending two hours as you might in much recent film: watching the degradation of human beings. For that alone, the film is worth your time.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
331,TigerMoods,underrated because of false expectations,8,17 December 2008,"i really cannot understand the people who watches the movies just to tell that they are bad...the day the earth stood still is a successful movie... and i think it is more realistic than all the other alien invasion movies. just think of it, we watched movies where the US president saves the world from the aliens or some ordinary guy blows up the alien battle ships... that's what you should call bad, this is much better than those movies...i can understand that most of the people were expecting more action but this time the danger comes in shape of flies that you can't even see and you are disappointed because you don't see the explosions and stuff that you expected to be in the movie... but there is one thing you should remember, seeing explosions is what you wanted, not what the director or the writer wanted... so try to watch the film as it is just a film without expectations and you will understand what i am trying to say... expectations can mislead an objective opinion in most of the cases...",The Day the Earth Stood Still
332,finnerss,Absolutely Disappointing,1,14 December 2008,"For a movie that was such a classic in 1951, in a time when communication was so hard to come by especially for world leaders and the common public, in the time of radio glory and TV not having as many broadcasters as today, and produced by an empire of visual effects and owner of Fox News for example, let's see a few points that probably went through the screenwriter's head, or probably the producer's zero to none creativity restraining the screen writing in what could have been an epic movie.1.- The president of the USA would have been one of the first characters that we would have been, it's not 1951, put simply with a fictional movie, ID4, Bill Pullman doing some even not presidential things, added so much to the movie like the speech, however in this case, Kathy Bates is placed in a character that is neither there nor there, a servant to the president where they are treating the ""Greatest discovery of mankind"".2.- The message. The 1951 movie was all about the message Klaatu was bringing to the world, and at the start even Gort was a lot more violent than what we see at first, simply desintegrating, literally all arms and potential dangers when Klaatu is shot. Now not only he is biological which was a good point, which ""seemed"" more threatening but there's no payback, since this one simply stays still as they pull him underground and even lets itself be ""drilled"". But back to the message, some parts of the movie were effective as what an arrogant race we are to think that we pose any obstacle to anyone who might arrive to earth with such technology, and does it even more magnificently so (no offense to the USA) by portraying Kathy Bates telling him about the President of the USA as if Klaatu should have heard of him, let alone of the way our planet works.However when they are to pass the message, in the meeting where Klaatu passes the epic ""We have created a race of robots..."" speech, simply goes by as if the whole production crew, director, screenwriter and anyone forgot that was the point of the movie! a Second chance but having showed they would make the earth stand still, instead they do it with these nanos which would have been better used if they did that to a couple of areas, then back to Gort, however Gort ""disappears"" when the nanos go flying out! The earth stands still, and he leaves... What message then? What did the world learn? which world leaders heeded to the message? ID4 even had more success at this than this fiasco of a remake so promising from the trailers.And one last point, why giving such an annoying kid (which the actor is so badly chosen) such a preponderant role? Seems that was the quirk they wanted to poise since in 1951 the kid was Klaatu's friend from the beginning. Professor Barnhardt, who is a major figure in the original film only lasts a few minutes while they reach his place and the obnoxious kid calls the cop on him, I think Scott Derrickson had just seen X-Men 2 but has to realize that it takes a good director to pull an epic movie off, someone like Bryan Singer at least.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
333,swissmanager,Something is missing bigtime...,6,16 January 2009,"... something really is missing here. What a shame. This could have been a great film, some of the scenes and script are brilliant, other parts are just down right silly and unworkable. We came out of the cinema feeling yes OK but something really was missing.The opening was interesting, then there was a mix-match of great moments with absolutely absurd incidents.Dr Helen, in the evening at home starting to prepare a meal for her brat of a step-son, receives a call from someone to say they are going to collect her and all will be explained en route. So a knock comes at the door and this brilliant scientist opens the door without even looking through the spy-hole or fasting the security chain/latch. And she goes with them ! Without asking for their IDs or getting a proper reason why ! Even en route all she can do is whimper at one stage to stop the car.Then, after joining the other scientists and ( she has so cleverly smuggled in her own mobile phone despite everyone else being searched ) having learned of this whopping big thingie that is going to strike out Manhattan, they are flown to their presumed deaths as they are seen hovering over Manhattan....... and so on....Lots of silly implausible scenes yet there are some great, dramatic scenes.But the whole film rests on Klaatu changing his mind and calling off the destruction of earth on the basis of the simple snifflings of our beautiful scientist.Here in Cairo, the film lasted barely 90 minutes - the intermission came after only 35. There must have been huge cuts made but still what should have, and could have been, a great film resulted in just another mediocre sci-fi spoof.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
334,ellisonhorne,It Should Have Been a Sequel!,1,6 September 2009,"Sorry, but this film was weak, flimsy and in the wrong hands with an immature director and a poorly written, misguided script. When one sees the ""how the film was made"" documentary, one can see all the ""what not to do"" things that abound in this project. Poor casting and a shallow music score made it even worse.Now, if I were asked to do this, I would start where the other film leaves off. It should be a sequel where Klaatu leaves us with a warning in 1951 and returns in 2009 with a conviction. Some of the plot lines would include scenes where the extremely wealthy make plans to leave the planet by means of space projects only they could afford to develop, while the rest of us have to come to terms with our true power--our poorly developed inner nature where we must discover our ability to love and care about life beyond all previous capacity: a kind of humane revelation happens. Also, we would get to witness the intergalactic counsel and see some of what life is like in other regions of the universe where peace has been achieved, and where it has not.Indeed, a sequel would be a much stronger way to do this film. It gives us a chance to see what has been done between nations, cultures, and the environment over the past nearly 60 years. What a fantastic opportunity to look at what humans have been doing during this period. And now we are discovering hundreds of planets in the universe, there is so much that could have been brought to the story that would give us reasons to deeply contemplate our situation, and our ability to discover a way for humanity to come together for the welfare of all life.By the way, the spaceship was a waste of time as well--looks soooooo CG! The bright spot is this movie is bad enough there's hope that one day someone will come forward with a beautiful, compelling and inspiring sequel--not a remake.I wish I could help make it.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
335,bgordon555,Movie will outlast bad reviews,8,31 December 2008,"My apologies if I release some SPOILERS not already mentioned, but I've already seen quite a few. But I just saw the movie and am grateful to have a place to share some thoughts. Come back after you've SEEN the movie, and this will make more sense anyway...Let's get one thing out of the way...this movie is NOT Citizen Kane. But it isn't as bad as many of the reviewers are making it out to be, and really, if you compare the KIND of movie it was back in 1951 (grade B sci-fi flick...maybe even B-?) this compares rather well. The movie makes you think, but it really does NOT make you think in the way you think it does. Certainly NOT if you take it at face value. But it seems to me even the DIRECTOR didn't know the real gem that exists within this movie, although SOMEBODY did. I'd almost wager a kind of bet between the Director, Producer, and/or Screenwriter. Somebody lost, and it was definitely the movie! This movie is NOT necessarily about militarism, though the original was, and it would have done the movie credit if it had kept that element. It is ostensibly about conservation, but not really.The true ""message"" of this movie is given by the Professor (John Cleese) and it's the one Keanu/Klaatu use to save the day. See the movie and that comment will make sense.Now, here's the TRAGEDY of the screenplay. When Keanu and Jada Pinkett Smith are in the truck together, they talk about Jada now not wanting Keanu to get killed. I was waiting on the edge of my seat for Keanu to simply ask the boy ""WHY?"" and it would have been an INFINITELY better movie. That in itself would have explained the whole rest of Keanu's actions without the tawdry stupid melodramatic scene in the cemetery. Certainly any alien civilization that would know enough about Earth to know English, would have seen enough tawdry melodramatic scenes like this...enough to either roil their digestive juices of want to cauterize the planet anyways.And one more note. If we act ANYWHERE NEAR as stupid as we do in this movie when visited by another civilization, Earth deserves to be blown to smithereens, no matter HOW melodramatic humanity may be or how many life supporting planets are left out there! Overall, I think this movie is well worth seeing, and will stand the test of time well...when all the reviews have been forgotten. The same fate as the original.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
336,Dr.Evil,"Screenplay by Al Gore, Carl Sagan.",2,28 January 2011,"Yes, everything about this movie is so P.C. it's sickening. 1. Unlike Star Trek, these aliens have no prime directive. 2. The military always shoots first. If you personally know anyone in the military I'm sure you were offended. 3. Politicians are only concerned about the party line, and ""know"" what's best for everybody. Despite those shown by the press, MOST politicians generally have well meaning in their hearts. 4. The religious immediately panic and the landing of this ship in central park makes everyone not an atheist cry to god to stop the apocalypse. 5. Every mother lets their child call them ""helen"". No wonder the kids in these movies are such brats. We know that's not the case.Now that I've gotten that off my chest lets at lease extol the good points. The acting is fine. If you take away the soundtrack and the special effects you see how weak the screenplay is. Bravo to the actors!Special effects were quite good, but GORT was so obviously CGI I expected him to turn into the Silver Surfer.Who in the cinematography dept chose to paste a drab pallor on the whole film.Anyway, if you're a movie buff like me go ahead and see it.

First thing that comes to mind after watching this, is that it is really really slow. There is not much going on. The story is very thin, characters do not evolve very much throughout the story, and when they do, they change their opinion so fast it does not really make any sense. So was it bad? Not really, no. I probably will never watch it again, and it is by far not a movie you must have seen once in your life... but somehow it was entertaining. The effects are very decent and Jennifer is always a pleasure to watch (but why a great actress like her chooses these strange movies to act in is a miracle).

Now, I am not a die hard fan, therefor, I did not go into this movie very mad that they remade the original like I was with Halloween.The acting is quite good. They've got Keanu Reeves, Jennifer Connelly, Cathy Bates, etc. A great cast. I was very relieved to see that, even though Klaatu had powers, he didn't completely remind me of Neo. I very much liked all of the characters, despite some needed development. The movie also has some decent affects and Gort looks more bad ass than ever. And that's not just talking about how he looks. I was happy to see that he did more than just stand there and look pretty, though I felt his introduction could have used some work. Last, the ending was good and satisfactory despite a bad line from little Smith.Professor Berhardt (I probably spelled that wrong) was one of my favorite characters in the original, yet he only gets about five minutes of screen time here and about four lines of ideologue. Like I said above, the characters were a bit underdeveloped. After work, the mother gets home, has an argument with her son, then she is picked up by people in suits. I would have had the audience see what these characters go through in there daily lives and then have the guys pick her up when she goes to bed. The lack of development also causes the movie to feel a bit rushed. I mean, they had plenty of time, why rush it? Last, the phrase ""Klaatu Barrada Nikto"" is there, though it's barely heard and, being that there is no true definition for these words, they could have put it into any situation in the film. Last, the movie is called ""THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL"" yet it didn't have a very global feel to it.And then there's the McDonalds scene.Overall, this is a fun popcorn flick with plenty of action, believable characters, and some witty, sometimes humorous ideologue.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

The acting was dismal, the plot line infantile and the overall effects outlandish. In all I considered an insult to my intelligence.

Klaatu is befriended by astrobiologist Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) who, with the help of her step-son and fellow scientist, (John Cleese), attempts to show him that humans have the capacity for change and are worth saving.The role of Klaatu seemed perfect for Reeves, who manages to embrace the emotionless nature of the alien but fails to show any charm or charisma, ultimately delivering a new level of rigidness.

That's the reason I wanted to see The Day the Earth Stood Still, but I didn't get what I was hoping for.I enjoyed the first 30 minutes of this film, where strange spherical things had been appearing all over the world and no one had any idea what to do, so they go and find the best scientists in the world, one of which was Jennifer Connelly. Then she's taken to the big sphere in central park, where everything seems to happen, where she *meets* Klaatu, played by Keanu Reaves, who knows slightly too much. So he's taken back to some sort of army base and is examined by Kathy Bates and co. and if I say anymore the 30 minutes end and all the answer come spick and span. But basically the earth is threatened by other beings knowing that we are doing no good for the world instead of I think nuclear issues in the original.The acting though was pretty good, Keanu Reaves doesn't really have an incredible acting role in this film, as for most of it he just stands and speaks with just one expression on his face, kind of like a concentrated anger. Connelly was good all they way through she never stood out in anyway but by no means bad. Jaden Smith was alright but I couldn't help but dislike his character, I found him annoying. I loved seeing John Cleese in this film; he brings subtle comedy into this quite serious film.The CGI was not amazing there's been better. Everything that was CGI looked like it was CGI. Also Gort I think his name is, the big metal man, he looks way to fake for a film like this.My main issue of this film is that the answers and conclusions come way too quickly and easily with most of the time Klaatu bringing up his new superpowers and saving the day. So I think this film needed more panicking and more of people not knowing what the hells going on.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
349,RebelYell_659,Relationships not developed enough,6,20 December 2008,The special effects were amazing. I took my 14 year old daughter and we both had a good time. I did not feel that the relationships between characters were believable or convincing. If the film was longer and the script tuned up a little bit this could have been a very good movie. Keanu Reeves and Jennifer Connely were both enjoyable to watch but Jaden Smith did not come across as believable or convincing. My 14 year old loved him however. This is an OK matinée film or red box video but not feature film. This film does not improve upon the original other than the special effects. The robot in this film is amazing and I would have enjoyed seeing a stronger bond between robot and Klaatu. It would have been funny to see some reference to the band Klaatu that made a brief impact on the rock scene in the later 70's.,The Day the Earth Stood Still
350,Weezy-LUiGi,Mandatory Viewing for Sci-Fi Fans,9,21 February 2017,"This is a film that truly holds up, even outside of its particularly problematic and quaint setting. By that, I mean that the goggles have never been on in my case regarding the 1950s. Many of the population wants to kid themselves that those were the wonder years, with no issues or problems whatsoever, while I am reminded of the McCarthy trials, civil sit-ins, and the Cold War paranoia overriding the quasi-intelligence of the nation. This is a film that stands as a true notable time capsule of said paranoia that plays out much like I imagine something like a visit from the extraterrestrial could happen, before the extremists decide that difference and ""the other"" is just too scary to handle, as illustrated so perfectly in the likes of Villeneuve's ARRIVAL and Zemeckis' CONTACT.Patricia Neal is the MVP of this movie. Her face is so expressive and her body language is filled with cool calm. Rennie does the job he was hired to and Hugh Marlowe is the perfect subversive prick who's only in it for the personal glory. Take that, clean-cut America. Not so respectable now, are ye?A mandatory viewing for all interested in anything approaching smart fictional allegories.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Why they cant write a good SiFi film these days is just sad and to top it off they ruined a good story with bad casting. Keanu Reeves is perfect for the part but the film was more about the kid.
I gave it 3/10 only because of Keanu Reeves as the rest was just bad.
It lost most of points because of Jaden Smith and bad writing.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
352,Rapturous_Rich,A fair cop,7,31 December 2008,"Ah yes, another remake. But before you pull out the old stake and flames, allow me to try and sway your mind on this one.Okay, given, the original is considered a classic. A milestone in sci-fi entertainment. But it is by no means untouchable, or as so many laud it to be, a masterpiece by any rights. And this update is probably less cheese- ridden than its 1951 source material. I mean let's face it: everyone has seen a sci-fi film from the '50s and they aren't exactly the best that the wide world of cinema has to offer. In the '60s Kubrick topped everything with 2001: A Space Odyssey; the '70s belonged to Close Encounters and Star Wars; the '80s saw Blade Runner, The Fly, Predator and Terminator; while the '90s offered Terminator II: Judgment Day, Starship Troopers, Event Horizon, eXistenZ and of course The Matrix; and the '00s gave us Sunshine, Transformers, Children Of Men, Casshern, Minority Report, A Scanner Darkly, Signs and even last year's I Am Legend to fill our palate. All the while, the Alien franchise ran through the last four decades. So in light of this, a little touch up on a now out of date concept is forgivable. Especially since those damn Ruskies aren't threatening us any more.The plot sees a group of strange spherical objects coming to Earth, one which is Keanu Reeves' Klaatu's ride into town, and the ensuing awe and wonder-slash-panic they induce thereafter. Upon interrogation he informs the people of Earth of an impending attack. But this is no classic alien invasion. Unlike War Of The Worlds, or Independence Day, they don't just turn up and start frying folk. No, good Klaatu gives the people a reason for it. In the original it was because of the hostilities of man  Cold War syndrome, much?  but seeing as it has been a far while since the fall of the Berlin wall, a slight change of plot devices is necessary. His reason is this: he is a friend of the Earth, he's out to look after it, but humans are too busy destroying it and there are only so many planets which can support life in the universe, so the human race which has been watched my Klaatu and his kind for many years to see if they change their attitude are now next on the to-be-extinct list. But Jennifer Connelly's Helen is adamant that people can change and begs with Klaatu to change his mind and while he can't see the better things in people and sets about planning the extermination (the spheres actually turn out to be something like mini-Noah arks which protect the planets animals while its other inhabitants will be dying) she takes it upon herself to become the sole saviour of mankind in showing him that they can change, that they will, and they'll be no need to wipe them out.Reeve's plank-blank face makes him perfectly cast as someone trying to act human. His performance turns from confusion and unease at being in a human body, to disgust at the human race for being so negligent, and eventually to that of pity which makes him mankind's redeemer (God/Christ parallels, anyone?). He is very cool and calculated, always in control, even when you think he's not he finds a way  witness his escape from federal custody for more details. Meanwhile, Connelly turns in a tough, determined woman, Hell-bent on showing the good in people to our alien visitor and his giant robotic friend GORT who does most of the dirty work. But it essentially Klaatu who is the more identifiable character here. He might be an alien, he might be wanting to destroy every last sole on the planet, but when you look at why, you can't help but agree. The update from Cold War fear to environmentalism is a daring step for the crew but it feels less patronising than some may think. Klaatu and GORT may be the interstellar equivalent of militant tree huggers but at least they're doing what they believe in with some gusto.Visually, the film is a spectacle. The move from any kind of classic UFO form is a wise one, to step aside from those corny clichés, and as stated above they do have their Biblical connotations as they protect from the forthcoming flood (or nanobots which eat everything) from GORT which, when they're released, are quite a sight to behold. As for GORT ""himself"", a God-knows-how-tall mechanical meany who looks very humanoid; his glowing strip of an eye and sheer power is enough to put the willies up anyone.In conclusion, and not really caring what the original fanboys want to say about it (""Oh my Gawwwddddd, boycott it!""  yeah, dudes, try something else, because boycotting only gets something more publicity) this reviewer at least will give you an unbiased opinion on a film which, yes, isn't the most original one you might see this year (or next), but its certainly one that'll entertain many an audience.Read more film reviews at www.wrawreviews.co.uk",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Keanu Reeves was excellent as Klaatu, he should always take roles as an android, but everything that made Robert Wise's 1951 movie a classic is missing from this version. It was more like mix of the Mummy and Starman. A bunch of metal beetles eating the world? Klaatu using salve and energy from a car to heal a man? Jennifer Connally gave a solid performance, but Jayden Smith left a lot to be desired. Picture Billy Gray tagging along after Michael Rennie, then Jayden Smith irritating Keanu Reeves, there's just something missing here. And not to mention the special effects. You expect cheap looking special effects from 1951, but not 2008.Watching the 1951 version, I was hoping for a happy ending.

357,anthony-burton,The Day I Loved a Film Everyone Else Hated,8,21 June 2009,"Reading other reviews for this film you could be forgiven for thinking it's an absolute stinker created solely to make money off 'green propaganda'. I disagree; it gripped me from the opening scene with Tyler Bates' haunting score complementing the snowy Indian mountains perfectly, right up to a fine and original ending which seems to have passed many by, such is its brevity. I've lost count of the number of reviews that claim the script to be simplistic and one dimensional, swiftly followed by statements complaining about the vague ending, which it isn't in the least. The last minute explains both the title of the film and what happens next in absolute terms.The special effects seem to have garnered criticism and maybe it didn't look as good on the big screen but it looks phenomenal on mine (47"" HD). Am i watching the same film as everyone else? I feel it's worth mentioning the photography because it's a beautiful film, the aliens and their ships are unique, ethereal and are always basked in mist or snow to great effect.It's such a visual film that the script is fairly minimal, but what there was satisfied me enough. Despite reading about 'preachy' moments, there aren't any, it's the general theme that i believe people object to, which is the real tragedy and almost proves the films entire point - people don't change unless they absolutely have to.Keanu was the perfect casting for Klaatu - however you look at it - and i loved the sinister undertones that he carried whilst never coming across as self righteous. The only missed opportunity i felt was the meeting of Klaatu and John Cleese's genius professor which didn't advance the plot and slowed the pace.I was enthralled from the start, liked the updated theme from the original and enjoyed it throughout. 9/10",The Day the Earth Stood Still
358,Pierre_Kirby,"Well well well, what do we have here? Another mediocre remake?",4,23 December 2008,"I really don't know why there are some people who defend remakes. I mean, for every good one, we get twenty crappy/mediocre ones. Well! The good news is that The Day the Earth Stood Still has some pretty CGI, and decent performances by Keanu, Connelly, and Cleese. The bad news is that the script and direction is worthless.The only reason why I wasted 5 dollars on this is because I haven't seen the original. I'm sorry, but if the original director handled the script as uninspired and as empty as the director in the remake did, then my hopes for seeing the original will definitely fade. Talk about taking every scene from every disaster movie ever, and implementing them (YET AGAIN) in the most boring way possible. And its loaded with even more bland sentimentality! The characters are cardboard cut outs of other characters from other movies. The scientific element in the movie started interesting when Klatuu reached Earth, but then became basic tripe all the way until the credits started.Even if the acting is good, it doesn't change the fact that the characters were not well written. Jennifer Connelly and Keanu deliver effective performances, but to what purpose? We don't care about these one dimensional characters! And what about Big Willie Style's son you ask? Well, he is very annoying as f*ck. But what can you expect from a script as worthless as this? At least he played the part that was given to him well enough to make us wish he suffers from irreparable damage. I see bright things for Will's son, but this isn't the best way to showcase his talent, not in insipid movies such as this one. The only memorable thing in the acting department was John Cleese, who turned out a subtle, but effective performance as Professor Barnhardt (even if the screen time was minimal).The only thing that worried me from this production isn't the constant product placement. Or its abundant use of clichés. Or its pathetic script. What worried me was that the director (Scott Derrickson) is working on Paradise Lost. On account of this, I conclude that the human race is definitely getting very close to extinction.4.2/10",The Day the Earth Stood Still
359,DaveGu,Hard to believe,3,12 December 2008,"Wow - what happened here? Was looking forward to and was totally disappointed with this movie. Yes, I saw the original and yes I couldn't help but compare the two, but even as a standalone, it was bad.For starters, what was that opening mountain scene in 1928 all about? What were we to learn from that snowy place? Now fast forward to present day. The first few minutes were interesting, but soon after the bottom of the barrel was in plain view.A few more observations.The Oriental fellow at McDonalds. He's there, has a conversation with Klaatu in 2 languages no less and we learn that he's been here for 70 years and wants to stay, knowing full well that impending doom is on its way. He did mention that he took a shine to us. One can only guess that he was on some sort of long term recon mission on earth, but why? To what end? Curious minds want to know. Now on to GORT for a moment. Oh yea, we, the earthlings named GORT, some acronym that was quickly forgotten. While GORT looked imposing and demos what it's capable of, what happens? He morphs into a mummy movie type swarm of tiny silvery bugs and as swarms do, starts reeking havoc - ""it has already begun"".

360,wtxx,Bad in almost every possible way.,2,31 May 2009,"This movie was bad right from the start. The first scene is a young attractive university professor assigning homework to her students while they're walking out of the room at the end of class. Even though nobody ever assigns homework like that in real life, for some reason they always do it in bad high school movies (though usually accompanied by the classic bell-ringing sound), so I immediately suspected that this movie was going to be bad.It just goes downhill from there. A convoy of about a million gigantic SUVs shows up at a home to pick up one single unsuspecting person for something so secret they won't even tell her why she's going with them, and for some reason she goes anyway (unnecessarily sending a million SUVs to pick up one person is apparently a great way to keep a secret). She goes to join a group of ""top scientists"" or something, and there's no obvious reason why the military has assembled this group of scientists since they didn't even have any particular matters of scientific interest at that point. Of course this group of scientists contains exactly one improbably young and attractive female, our one-dimensional protagonist. And, being female, she obviously forms an immediate emotional bond with the alien... After that, it's basically a bunch more illogical plot and an annoying child, mixed in with a vague pseudo-environmentalist theme of how humans are destroying their planet.The ending was so unremarkable that 10 minutes after the movie was over, my friend turned to me and said ""wait a minute, did we actually watch the end? How did it end again?"" And I couldn't remember either.In retrospect, I probably didn't need to write all that. I can summarize this entire movie in three words: Bad, dumb, and bad. I give it two stars instead of one for some vaguely intriguing moments after they first get the alien into the lab, and the cool giant alien that looks like (i.e. is a ripoff of) Iron Man.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
361,orion_ss1,The Day the Earth Stood Still; but not still enough,5,12 December 2008,"When I heard there was going to be a remake I was stunned; remakes rarely are worth the effort. The CONSTANT TV teasers made me rethink my position, and I started looking forward to it. We went to the opening day matinée, and the theater was all but empty! I'd expected many to take the day off to be first, but no lines. They must have known!I hope this isn't considered a spoiler: I thought GORT was way over-sized ( considering its role in the film ), and named by the Earthmen as an acronym!?!Many of the names from 1951 were used here, but with unnecessary ( I thought ) twists. Mrs. Benson becomes Dr. Bensen, drafted into service as in The Andromeda Strain ( men in black at the front door ). 1951 Robby Benson was adorable; 2008 Jacob Benson was a true brat, giving the baby sitter more respect than his step-mother, going so far as to call her Helen.No intimidating-but-sensitive Klaatu in 2008; my girlfriend expected him to be revealed as a robot too; I was certain this was not the case because the polygraph operator was told Klaatu's body did feel pain.Klaatu himself called off an angry GORT with a distorted noise that might have been 'Barrado Nicto', but I couldn't be sure.Other twists or changes later in the film were similar, and might be considered 'spoilers' so I'll not risk further comment.Exception: John Cleese's Professor Barnhardt was a good update, and very well played; the change from 1951's problem in celestial mechanics update to quantum mechanics will probably go unnoticed by most.I also have a problem with 'original music' being 're-composed'; I think a better term is 'arranged' or 're-arranged'.My comments on the movie's message would probably be considered a spoiler except to say: I don't think a species that followed the movie's message could make it into space.

For a 'Hollywood Blockbuster', I thought this film was flat. Klaatu couldn't work out if he was good or bad (killing a guy then bringing him back to life merely to announce he was going to destroy the whole human race), and Helen something who had a more important role in her family than stopping Klaatu. I couldn't understand the moans about the lack of 'Gort'. From what I can tell, he appeared after Klaatu was shot, was restrained, he destroyed missiles and smashed planes and tanks. Then he is taken away, they try to kill him and he dissipates into lethal dust and begins killing everyone and everything. GOrt did plenty and was well on his way to committing genocide. To that I will hear no moans of 'where's Gort????' OK. The plot was a bit thin, and some of the acting was odd (particularly, deadpan-and-beginning-to-rot Keanu) but I didn't think the film deserved the bad press.

Okay and what about the ending i was left confused. Why didn,t they show humans using cleaner energy like biofuel gas stations or nuclear plants or hydroelectricity.

364,RCD1321,Doesn't even stack up to the original,4,12 December 2008,"Now, put the times aside and look at the whole basis of the film- alien comes to earth, gets shot by jittery soldier, miraculously heals then proceeds to tell the U.S. Military leadership that it is imperative that he speak to the World Leaders. That's the jist, but then it just falls short in the new 2008 version. The story doesn't follow the same line, the characters are nothing like the originals, and not having read the short story but seen the original several times, ends completely different. First off that bugged me was Jacob, Helen's ""step son,"" in the original he fell in love with Klaatu (although not suspected of being an alien until later- which they did a horrible job with that twist in the re-make as well), in the remake he despises and want's someone to kill Klaatu. And you'll know it when you see it, but GORT was done horribly, especially his destructive force and not to mention he was never talked about or referred to as GORT by Klaatu. Finally, the worst possible part, was in the original, Klaatu came to earth to warn of the Robots designed and programmed to enforce peace that if earth continued it's destruction and violence the world would be destroyed, a very good moral point, the new one, there wasn't even a chance at a warning, and it seemed our fate was decided before the ""spheres"" even arrived (which I get the whole new age style on sci-fi spaceships, but c'mon, the original picked on the whole UFO/Flying Saucer craze, they could have been a little better in this one that just big globes that looked like they were full of smoke). Now- as a stand alone sci-fi movie, this wasn't really THAT bad. It had an okay plot if you totally disregard the original, and it was the perfect role for Reeves, blank, emotionless, and serious the whole time- on purpose. If you don't mind all the jumping around and making the U.S. Government look like a bunch of war mongers then you should get some satisfaction, but wait for the DVD, it's really not the best movie ever and it won't ever win an award or be held in high regard in the sci-fi realm along side greats like War of The Worlds, Alien, Aliens, Predator, and yes, even Independence Day.

365,brad12d3,Balanced review for all types of movie goers.,7,15 May 2009,"First of all I have never seen the original. In fact in my opinion it is probably pretty futile to make comparisons to the original. Without seeing the original I can tell that there are a lot of changes made. I think it would be best to judge this film on it's own merits as if it wasn't a remake. Because let's face it, how often do remakes really stay true to the original, besides Gus Van Sant's psycho that if I remember correctly recreated the original shot by shot apart from a few added bits. I would assume that those who have seen the original would not hold this film in high standing and with good reason. It does not reach the heights of the original masterpiece yet claims the same name and story. Like I said I have not seen the original and I was very hesitant about seeing this one given the large amount of negative reviews. I don't think the film is as bad as many make it out to be, it just suffers from at least one major weakness that I have observed. That is how well the story and characters were fleshed out. I thought the characters personalities fit well enough, and Jaden was not as obnoxious as some claim him to be. I can easily see a young boy in that situation acting just the same way as he did. I found it to be an enjoyable film but it didn't wow me. I think it's problem is that it didn't have it's plot and characters fleshed out enough for the serious film goer, and it didn't have enough action (aka eye candy) for the action junkie. It fell somewhere in the middle without fully satisfying either extremes of moviegoers. There were many things that I thought were done very well in this film, but overall it didn't have enough to connect with the different types of audiences and as result has become a fairly forgettable film with some very interesting and well done parts that I believe make it worth at least one viewing if you haven't seen it.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

367,pcs3746,Pitiful - Just Pitiful,2,8 August 2010,"I have never been so let down by a remake of a film I really liked as a kid. First of all, we must realize the original story is not all that fulfilling. It is a difficult concept to present in logic. The alien is not going to make contact with officials, end up in their hands and then escape without some one having taken pictures of it. Once the alien escapes in both makes of this story, no one seems to have thought to have taken a photo of the guy. Also, Gort is underutilized in both films. But, that is the nature of the story.However, in the remake they have destroyed any sense of suspense the audience may have ever hoped for. Keanu Reeves is flat and unemotional. The kid, played by Smith is just so over bearing and snotty you just want to slap him. The Secretary, played by Kathey Bates is some kind of over-powered ""Wunder Matron"" with apparently no need to report to the President or the Military...she is the ""Uber Commander"" Klaatu probably wanted to speak to in the first place, considering the power she seems to wield in this film.Klaatus omnipotent powers over all things mechanical make him apparently more powerful a creature than the statuesque Gort.I wanted to see flying saucers, and flashes of heat rays and some better moves on the part of the terrifying Gort. I wanted to see the girl endangered and then blessedly rescued by the scary dude. I wanted to see the scientists and the militarists truly humbled before a greater, benevolent power.Instead, I saw destruction on a mindless scale, with no compassion, and a cast that were well rehearsed, but about as involved in the script as the little nanites that composed the massive, but shamefully inert Gort.I gave this film a 2 only because the digital effects were pretty good, though much over used. Like, the space ship(s) were really un-imaginary...orbs with strange shifting colors...they could have used a lava lamp. And, worse, the producers/director seemed devoted to issuing the audience with Al gore hand out leaflets with their green message of ""Save the planet...do your part or some disinterested alien will come along and take away our dolphins.""

368,fuzzhead72,A bid letdown for any fan of the original,1,14 December 2008,"My wife and I went to see this on the first day of release. We had watched the original at the 25th Annual 24 Hour Science Fiction Marathon earlier this year, and it had reminded me of how much I liked the original. (which stands the test of time quite well) I didn't want to get my hopes up too much for this one, and was just hoping for it to have a coherent plot and decent special effects.I ended up rather disappointed in many respects. My gut feeling after watching this movie was that it was just a waste of time politically correct bunch of drivel.In a nutshell, the writer wants us to all agree that if another species on earth goes extinct, we should all feel that humanity should die in order to preserve all of the little critters on Earth.The dumbest part of the movie is that evidently the destruction of our technology is supposed to accomplish this. Technology has allowed a great increase in population, but has also at the same time slowly been bringing down barriers to tackling some of the very same ecological problems that the film brings up.If the world governments collapse, and we all go back to burning coal and trees to stay warm, does anybody really believe we are going to make solving ecological issues a primary concern? I didn't think so. As someone who graduated with a BS in Environmental Studies, I would have hoped that the people who made this film would have been a bit more grounded in reality.Also, a big disappointment for me was that the famous line from the original did not appear to be uttered during the movie.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

But dare i say it i thought the message in the film was a lot deeper and the effects though great took more of a backseat. The acting and maturity to the screenplay were present and i feel this is a film that won't attract the 'gun-ho' crowd who like their action thick and fast and hence the poorer box office numbers. When a film like Twilight (which i also though was better than i thought) ranks in the dough it is clear the theatrical market is based on a teenage audience and quite frankly i can't see that crowd digging this.Keane Reeves was tolerable, Jennifer Connelly quite good, John Cleese, though brief, good and Kathy Bates as always was excellent. I agree with most that the kid was mis cast and really even when he was hit with his own morality didn't really present as a likable character and i feel that was due to a mis casting on the behalf of the makers of the film. I think we are meant to follow his way of thinking but them come to the revelation and moment where we are touched between the relationship between him and his step-mother but this never quite worked.As mentioned though, i found the overall message to be a a lot deeper than expected and i think it fits with the current world climate on us as a species and the planet. I know the first was more around our violence and possible nuclear devastation but the 'green' theme suited today's time better.The movie is not outstanding nor a masterpiece and maybe the original is, as stated haven't seen it. But i was entertained and thought there was some depth to the whole thing that goes beyond the norm for these types of movies. I almost would call this the 'thinking man's Independence Day'.Definitely above average if only just.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
370,jlongstreth-1,Low expectations were exceeded,6,2 December 2009,"My husband and I watched this last night, expecting a MST3K-worthy worse than bad movie. It wasn't all that bad, really.(Of course, I'm one of those who does believe the human race is killing the planet, so that puts me at odds with quite a few people right off the bat. I'm okay with that.) Keanu Reeves was appropriate for the role. Jennifer Connolly was also okay. I don't understand why the child could not be her natural child-he could have been biracial, but they had to convolute it so that she married his father and was not his biological mother. Seemed like they went through a lot of contortions to avoid her being his ""real"" mother.The GORT robot was terrific. More nanotech giant robots, please! I especially liked the way his ""eye"" seemed to follow the observer when they had him locked up in the experimenting area.The visuals were pretty good. I would have liked more ""worldwide"" coverage of the spheres and more of the Ark activity because apparently a few people missed it. **********Possible Spoiler************ It was a tad heavy-handed but still entertaining and I loved when she realized he said he came to save the ""earth"", not the people on it. Good stuff.Definitely worth a rental, if not a 2001-level classic.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
371,hitechcleaning5,Focus on the message.,8,12 May 2009,"I have one major problem with this film and one minor problem. My major problem is Jared Smith. His character is without doubt the most arrogant, supercilious, narcissistic, obnoxious and overbearing child character I have ever seen in any media. The bit of it is the ""acting"" he did was to be less of a conceited little worm than he probably is in real life.My minor problem was the corny reference to the Noah's Ark myth. In my mind the only thing more ludicrous than that story is the fact that some people actually believe it, would kill or die over it and hold deep hostility, hatred and prejudice against those who do not believe it. This a minor problem because, after all, unwillingness or inability to change and accept reality is the central thesis of the film.There are those who are swift to criticize Keanu Reeves' performance as Klaatu because his character, to some, lacks emotion and depth. The simple fact is that Klaatu is something other than human inside a human body. For him to be like a spiffy trial lawyer with a 100% kill ratio simply does not fit the role. He has logic, purpose, power and zeal. He learns that change can and should occur in himself. I can't imagine anyone better suited for the part.Others believe that Jennifer Connelly's character is disjointed and detached from the rest of the world. This may be true, but her character IS different. She sees Klaatu as more of a solution than a problem. She connects with him, defends him, believes in him and is the first to recognize that he is a force with reason, not just an agenda. She balances her fears with conviction and is the perfect protagonist. Kathy Bates always pleases. At first she is the officious duty oriented subordinate to a typical U.S. president who clamors for exclusive control for something that is beyond control. She takes hostile action under the false belief that force and violence is the only way to confront something that is virtually impervious in terms of preemptive military intervention. She later softens but regretfully follows the directives of her leader. Her character arc, while subtle, is valid and believable.While short, the role of the professor played by John Cleese is pivotal in the sense that his remark about ""change at the precipice of destruction"" has impact on Klaatu as he toils with a decision that can only be made by him.Yes, there were flaws. And yes, there were glitches. Nevertheless these are well compensated by the inherent message and by the question ""what happens now?"" The answer to that question is a controversy, but controversy sells and if it weren't for Jared Smith I'd give this one a 9 without doubt.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Through the movie he was the epitome of a little craphead until the very end when his nature takes a 180.For a being coming from a non-violent race (at least according to the original) Klaatu sure loves violence.If you do decide to watch this movie, don't pay money to do so.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

The day after the day after tomorrow when the earth's screenwriters stood still.This really is a dreadful piece of film making. The plot has more holes than my grandpa's string vest and the acting is appalling; the script is terrible and the direction is dull and plodding.On the surface we seem to be faced with the usual Hollywood ""save the planet"" Liberal agenda. However, on closer inspection, this film seemed to have an underlying message that I found quite distasteful and not a little disturbing: i.e. we shouldn't worry our pretty little heads about the environment and we can all carry on as normal because ""only when humans are on the precipice will we change and do the right thing"" (I'm paraphrasing here as I'm certainly not gonna watch this piece of crap again simply to get the quote right).As another comment on this site says, it's as if the filmmakers are intentionally trying to keep the audience passive by giving the impression that love and/or a simple quick fix will eventually save the day.

376,laserdude,Why Have so many bashed this movie? It's GREAT!!!,10,15 December 2008,"I went to see this movie The Day The Earth Stood Still (DTESS) with the feeling of wanting to compare this one to the original. I had read many of the comments about this movie and wanted to see for myself what the negative buzz was about. I was tremendously surprised at how much I liked this movie. I think a couple of things may have misled viewers because of the coming attractions of this film. It seems like folks were probably expecting the robot GORT to go around destroying cities and being a general baaaadasss character. But what DTSS turned out to be was a really good sci-fi movie. You have to really pay attention to the dialog to get the full jist of this tricky film. For Klaatu never really has any love or care for humanity. Their goal is to wipe mankind off the face of this planet to allow other forms of life to exist as well as future beings from other worlds. And pay close attention to what he says near the end of the film when he decides to stop humankind's extinction. He said it will cost you something. It's a tricky line, but if you follow it and watch the end of the film you'll understand why the Earth stands still. I won't piece it together for everyone...see if you can figure it out. I love this movie for it's smartness. Many have complained about this being another special effects, mindless mess. It is not. The visuals enhance it...but you really have to think along with the film and sit back an enjoy. (Updated June 06, 2009). The film's ending where Kathy Bates character looks at her watch and sees that it has stopped. Then scenes are shown of trains, cars, boats stopping - suggests to me that the price humanity had to pay for their world being saved was to have all electrical and mechanical devices shut off permanently. Remember that Klaatu doesn't have any real love for the human race but begins to see the possibility of their having compassion. So since it was mankind's machinery that was effecting the planet, the best way to solve this situation without wiping humnity off the planet would be to neutralize all manmade things. Hence the title ""The day The Earth Stood Still"". I might have it wrong, but that's my take.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

378,CliffFraser,Entertaining and Thought Provoking,8,29 July 2009,"I don't know how I missed this movie in 2008. I have suffered some real rubbish movies of late (circa 2009), but like books, once started I have to finish, no matter how bad they are. Now I've read a lot of criticism about the 2009 version of 'The Day The Earth Stood Still', but I have to admit the story and the message elevated me above being immediately critical about the various less-than-worthy aspects of the movie that have been justifiably raised by other critics. I watched it for what it was meant to be, pure entertainment, 100 minutes of my life I could well afford and donated gladly. It re-kindled many thoughts in my mind that have been lounging around for some time now.Right from the start of the movie when the alien gets shot I wanted the aliens to win, (am I the only one?) such is my growing disgust for all things human on this planet. Rightly so, the movie measures us against all the other life forms that inhabit Earth, giving as much credence to their right to live as to ours. It's a fact that dinosaurs roamed this planet for a period of time 600 times longer than Homo Sapiens has been in the driving seat, our tenancy is in its infancy by comparison and yet most human beings think they are what the planet was waiting for.I really wanted the aliens to succeed with their sanitization of the planet, for some time I have thought how nice it would be to clear this great planet earth of human beings and let it revert to better times. Basil Fawlty (AKA Prof. Jacob Barnhardt) was wrong, the aliens were right. Nations that have atomic bombs call them 'deterrents', nations that don't but aspire to having them are said to desire 'weapons of mass destruction', for me they are the ultimate cleansing agent just like the black bugs in the movie.Wow, such uproar, no doubt myriads of itchy fingers reaching for keyboards to vent their wrath upon my words in some kind of proxy revenge. Don't bother, the fact that you even think about doing it is proof positive of the perniciousness of the human mind. This movie, while not perfect at least goes a long way in pointing a finger at the culprits, humankind, the scourge of this earth.I'm not a 'green' or an activist, just an observer becoming more ashamed by the day of being human. But human beings are what they are, despicable self appointed 'super beings' that think they're the ultimate life form created in the image of equally pernicious gods that direct them in the guise of a thousand religions to kill, maim, swindle, rob and generally cause harm to each other and every other living thing. Our desperate search for life on other planets is merely our desire to extend the reach of our lust for other life forms to exploit or kill.More or less everything on this Earth has been here since the beginning of everything, as the alien Klaatu said in one throw-away line in the movie, '...the universe is not wasteful it's all recycled'. For me it's definitely time for the human race to move over, the quicker it is recycled the better.And finally suck on this; in a billion years time man will be long gone, but the atoms we're all made of right now will still be here, but not in their current configuration, thank those gods.A very entertaining and thought provoking movie that gets 7 out of 10 stars from me.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

This one is a brilliant example of such cr*ppy movies that don't resemble the quality of the original at all. All movies now contain whiny, annoying, hateful brats, and this is no exception.

380,Bobby747,A decent movie,7,2 January 2011,"I feel this film got bad reviews over it's depiction of the military in a time where the political rhetoric in the US and Canada is to, ""Support the Troops."" However, as recent history dictates, generally the army will do what is asked of them regardless of what the personal opinions of the soldiers might be. Supporting the troops doesn't necessarily mean supporting a war. Opposing an unreasonable war and demanding the troops be brought home is in fact supporting the individuals who are willing to sacrifice everything for the well-being of their nation's people. Anyways, on to the actual movie review.For a science-fiction movie, I found this to be quite good actually. Recent news of Stephen Hawking saying that alien contact would likely mean colonization/invasion is a perfect example of the kind fear people have about first contact with alien species that are far more advanced than us, and the reaction that humans might have. However, for obvious reasons it is sometimes hard to detect when Hawking is being sarcastic unless he would add, ""ha-ha-ha-!"" One can't really expect too much from a film like this, the writing was pretty bare-bones, none of the characters were particularly ""meaty,"" roles, and the story was very fast paced and to the point (which isn't a bad thing). Socio-politically I think the movie makes its point as a warning or reminder about humanity's effect on the Earth. Given the time of the original 1951 film, it is more than understandable that humanity's opinion of itself in general was pretty bleak. As in destroying each other is boiled down to ""human nature,"" and just accepting that.I personally believe people stand a chance against the potentiality to destroy itself, so long as a people can learn to control their baser emotions and take something of importance away from even the most horrific situations. I think if even someone as crazy as Kim Jong-Il can come around and say, ""Hey... we really should just end the war. Because so long as the war remains, nuclear warfare is an inevitability,"" (paraphrasing of course), then I think most other people can learn to be more mindful and driven to make humanity's outlook an optimistic one.I know my review went a little off-the-rails, but this was what the movie made me think about.I would typically give a movie like this a 6, but I gave it a 7 because I feel a lot of people were unfair with their reviews. Anyways, watch the movie, just don't expect it to be a classic like, ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" or, ""E.T.""",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Now the message is ""you've screwed the planet, there aren't many livable one's around, so you've gotta go"". The point wasn't belabored, it was simply stated. Klaatu accepted the verdict of a predecessor that we were incapable of change. This was confirmed by his own brief experience here and so he triggered our doomsday. Then he saw another side to us and made his own decision to halt the already underway destruction.

385,Mathewdixon42,It stands on its own pretty well,7,6 May 2016,"This film stands apart from other Sci-fi remakes of the day, as it did not take the effect heavy action/blockbuster route. While thrilling, this movie focuses more on the moral implications of it's subject matter, rather than just blowing stuff up for an hour and a half. I should say right off the bat, I only saw the original 1951 film once. So I won't be making too many comparisons in this review. I'll be looking at this film on it's own merits. I have always loved Jennifer Connelly. I have always thought she should do more big budget films, as she is a wonderful leading lady. Having said that, her character Helen is not as interesting. For the most part she is a cardboard scientist. The scenes involving her and Jaden Smith are very poignant and emotional however. Jaden Smith was pretty convincing as a bratty kid in this film. He just lost his father and is living with his stepmother. Smith seems to be the most down to earth character in the film. During all of the world-ending danger going on throughout, his simply wants his father back. This is exactly what a real kid would do, think about their own world. Smith handles this well and is very believable in his sincerity. Keanu Reeves. He is a talented man, he has shown in the past that he has a decent amount of range. Since then he seems to have settled on stoicism. He is good at it, it may not work in all of his films, but it works very well here. His monotone performance is very compelling and alien in nature. The supporting roles are filled by several very talented actors. While I don't have the space to go into detail for each of them, I wanted to name them out of respect for their performances. Jon Cleese, James Hong and Kathy Bates all perform their respective roles very well. As for the story, I acknowledge that the ""Humans are destroying the earth and ourselves"" plot has been done so many times now it borders on cliché. I believe it works here for one simple reason, the 1951 film was one of the first to do it. This film is unique in using the Step-Mother/Step-Son relationship to show humanities capability to grow. It it well done and is not something you'd normally see in wide release film-making. The visuals and special effects are well done. Most of all they do not distract from the acting or the story driving quieter moments that I believe make the film. 7/10. This film gains points for mostly the performances of Jaden Smith and Keanu Reeves. The inclusion of the Step-Mother/Step-Son plot was very emotional and unique. It only loses points for its sometimes clichéd nature. It also has several uninteresting performances and characters. The heavy CGI moments do not add much to the film and are for the most part unnecessary.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
386,seansworks,"A could have been, and almost was",5,28 January 2013,"The Day the Earth Stood Still.This is such a disappointing movie, and should be for many. Not because of any pre-conceived expectations, right or wrong, of remaking a classic. But because it does enough right that it's failings shine out all the more.There's a story here, of our first alien contact, a warning from more intelligent life that humanity is on the brink of destroying itself. It's a bit cliché, but alright in concept. Especially as the human paranoia and ignorance immediately turn our first contact into something violent, unintentional as it is.What follows is both potential and the disappointment. Potential in showing that humanity as a whole fundamentally disagrees with itself, as some humans try to help and learn from our first contact with intelligent life, while the large bureaucracy of government, fearful of change, sees only something to fear and to control.It's a good use of science fiction, to show an indictment of how our world is run. That we are lead not by people looking out for our benefit, but by people looking out first and foremost for their own power. Meanwhile the people that have lead humanity through actual advancement over the millennia, our scientists and thinkers, want only to learn what it is that these aliens have come for, and what it is we can learn from them.And insofar as the movie goes it succeeds well in this aspect. Keanu Reeves, for all the appropriate jokes, does indeed do well as an alien sent to earth. The height of the movie is him and John Cleese solving a troubling physics equation together, in harmony and to the tune of a classical piece of music. It works wonderfully.But the movie begins to fall down on other pieces. The crisis mentioned earlier is that humanity is pushing the planet into unsustainability, a perfectly true message many are glad to ignore. But then takes this idea, and instead of the aliens coming here to warn humanity to save itself, they see humanity as doomed and choose to save other species because life bearing planets are rare.Which is troubling as it's untrue, Mars itself may have had life on it, as well as there being little doubt as far back as 2008 as to the at least tens of thousands, if not millions upon billions of life bearing planets in the universe. A niggle at first, but still it's there, and one that could have been avoided had the writer simply kept the aliens to warn of our own impending self destruction.But the movie really falls down on the other portions. Jaden Smith, while not necessarily bad, is an unnecessary addition as a prototypical ""child we are supposed to attach to"" role, and has no other purpose in the story. Despite this he takes up and inordinate amount of running time, being framed as sympathetically innocent and relatable.And then comes the ending, which starts right after the best scene in the whole film with Reeves and Cleese. The aliens decide humanity must all be killed to save the planet earth. Which doesn't really endear them to the audience that much obviously, nor does it make sense as, while we as humans can kill ourselves, killing the entire planet would be much harder.To make matters worse, Reeves the alien decides to give humans a chance, but for no apparent reason other than to have some action scenes can't do so until he reaches the spaceship he came in. Meaning the humans have to drive him back there while the nightmare of Von Neumann machines wipe out the earth. For those that don't know, Von Neumann machines are self replicating robots. In the nightmare version, they feed off anything applicable, breaking down everything in there way into more of themselves.Meaning the Von Neumann machines get to go around in a cloud of silvery particles devouring everything. Which turns out to be really boring to watch as everything just sort of dissolves into a silver cloud without anything being able to stop it.In the end the McGuffin of the spaceship is turned off, after killing several hundred million people, but its OK because the main character and Jaden Smith are alive! Reeves says that he'll give humanity a chance not to destroy itself, but to guarantee that chance he'll disable all electronics and power on earth permanently. And then the movie ends.Gee, thanks advanced aliens. You came here, casually decided to murder hundreds of millions of people because someone got scared and accidentally shot you because you showed up suddenly and basically unannounced in the middle of New York. And now, as a ""chance"" you've disabled the entire basis for modern civilization and technology, presumably causing most of civilization to collapse into chaos and anarchy and killing billions of more people. But it's OK because the plants and fish will survive now! And why do this? To shoehorn in one of the big plot points of the original movie at the end of course.What vast disappointment to a movie with some clever ideas, casting, and even directing.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

The original 1951 version was indeed an anti-nuke film but gave a spark of hope for mankind. This version hating mankind enough to destroy all of human civilization took a rainbow collection of children to a new planet where uneducated as to the sins of mankind on earth could start it all over again on a virgin planet. Remaking a classic is difficult at best but this script and director didn't have a clue as to the point of the original. what finally turned my stomach was the premise that the robot could at the molecular level take anything apart, so why not just disassemble the pollution, the weapons and toxins? then the mega-industries causing the pollution and making the weapons would be negated. Mankind would be reset, and allowed to try again. Instead, with all the power at his disposal the screenwriters main character via the robot took the primitive path of total destruction instead of the benevolent premise of compassion and understanding. Yes the possible destruction of earth was hinted at in the 51' TDTESS, but only as a last resort.

My son hated the remake. I was bored too. Keanu Reeves in the lead was a mistake. And the obvious allegory to our alleged rape of the planet being at the center of the alien's visit- it is sickening. This is less a remake of the 1951 classic than it is a remake of 04's The Day After Tomorrow. Jennifer Connelly is again wasted. The kid actor is cute but cannot act very well. Cleese is decent for the 3 minutes on-screen, but all in all, this film is forgotten by the time you get home from the theater. If you want halfway decent entertainment, go see it.

How would we react to visitors that had human-like features? And all in all is the human race really worth saving? Could we really prove to anybody that we are nothing more than base animals?Reasons why this is not a ten.

Keanu needs to be finally consigned to stud. I loved the Matrix, Constantine and Point Break, but lets be realistic, the man is a plank, he can't act.

393,Hinosan417,Disappointing remake of a classic,3,24 December 2008,"I can't say I was surprised that this movie was a dud (a local paper gave it 1 1/2 stars out of 4) but I still wanted to see it because I feel the 1951 original is among the best science fiction movies ever made. This 2008 version isn't nearly as good. At first glance one might think this is the sort of role that's made for Keanu Reeves (with his notorious lack of normal affect), but Michael Rennie's Klaatu was compelling in the original because he clearly cared about his mission and the beings who would be affected by it. More importantly, the scenario in this 2008 film is based on a very vague premise about the danger posed to the biosphere of Earth by humanity itself - which may be true, but is never explained in detail; rather, the premise rests on audience knowledge of media coverage about global warming and threats to biological diversity - which again may be true, but remains a nebulous threat to the average person. In contrast, the threat of nuclear war was very immediate and real in 1951 when the original film was released (indeed, the film was released in the middle of the Korean War when use of nuclear weapons was openly contemplated), and it would not be hard for the average viewer to imagine extraterrestrials being alarmed by the threat of warlike humans expanding into space with nuclear weapons. In contrast, it's less easy to imagine a consortium of extraterrestrials resolving to exterminate humanity because of the threat we pose to other life on our own planet; notwithstanding the rather brutal simplicity of that premise (which totally overlooks genuine if belated efforts at ecological responsibility on the part of human governments, organizations and individuals), Klaatu posits that a world like the Earth is inherently valuable because of its biosphere, but I would think that Klaatu's civilization - having mastery of biotechnology in particular - would be able to terraform all kinds of planets, reducing the treasured status of Earth as a haven of biological life. Also, the aliens' view would seem to ignore the fact that evolution has given biological life remarkable ability to adapt to change, and there's no particular reason to expect that the biosphere of Earth couldn't repair itself even if we humans managed to wipe ourselves out. Combined with a conclusion to the film that is unsatisfying both logically and emotionally, I found the remake entirely disappointing.Other aspects of the film are also disappointing, such as blatant product placement exemplified by a gratuitous extended visit to McDonalds. Also, Gort was lame compared to the robot of the original; I know the original Gort's death ray may seem very old-fashioned but I was kind of looking forward to Gort doing some old-fashioned vaporizing. The main weapon actually used by the aliens - a cloud of nanobots which grew as it consumed material - is very plausible, but I found it odd that the nanobots so closely resembled terrestrial bugs when the film took pains otherwise to make it clear that Klaatu came from an exotic alien world unlike our own.Is there anything good about this film? I suppose Jaden Smith was somewhat likable as the kid, and I felt he could have been very engaging if the script were better written. Also, the depiction of the starship as an orb full of swirling mysterious energies was neat as an attempt at depicting alien technology. And I suppose I kind of give the movie points for trying to reveal something about the origins of this particular Klaatu with an opening sequence set 80 years before the main story (although it isn't really very effective and just made a ponderous and boring movie that much more ponderous and boring).Overall, aside from genre fans who are curious to see how this compares with the original, or very serious fans of Keanu Reeves or Jennifer Connelly, I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Reeves and Connelly were great as expected, and I wish Cleese had a longer role. The premise and the plot was interesting and original. The CGI effects were beautiful and convincing. All in all, very enjoyable movie.Now, the cons. The kid (Smith) was playing a very annoying character, betraying and insulting everyone - there's no way he could be part of a reason anyone would like humanity. Oh, and that GORT looks like he's taken straight out of 50's sci-fi (probably is, once again I haven't seen the original). A boring metal blob of a giant robot that destroys everything. The director should've done like Michael Bay with Transformers, changing them from blocky bright-colored cartoons into beautifully detailed and utterly alien machines. He does make up for it a bit though by what the GORT turns into (not gonna spoil this). One last thing, I wish I had seen this in IMAX instead of a TV screen.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

396,DexterManning,The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008): A Review.,2,31 January 2009,"Here we are, with another questionable revamp of a classic film. This time the dubious honor goes to ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" the classic science fiction tale from 1951 directed by Robert Wise, of a space alien named Klaatu who visits Earth to warn against mankind's ongoing hostilities, which stand to impact peaceful planets elsewhere. It's a problem that cannot be allowed to continue. The aliens, who long ago learned to maintain peace at home, would ensure that, so long as the human race is a threat to other planets, the very survival of people on their own planet would be jeopardized. In a small supporting gesture, the electricity that is so essential in driving life on Earth suddenly ceases to exist, and, although people remain alive, their way of life comes to a dead standstill throughout the globe.The original was made in the style of many B-movies of its era featuring the usual trappings: a flying saucer made of streamlined metal; a huge metal robot with a slit that opens to reveal a destructive beam of light; a mysterious alien; chase sequences; acting that is somewhat wooden. Despite the styles of the storyline and aesthetics, this film is considered more significant and relevant than such a status would imply, due to its call for harmony in a time shortly after the horrors of a real-life world war, a continuing cold war and threats of nuclear Armageddon. Ironically, if had not become such a classic, it probably would not have been remade.Fortunately, this year's versiondirected by Scott Derrickson from a script by David Scarpa, which, in turn, was based on the 1951 screenplay by Edmund H. Northavoids the scene-by-scene carbon-copying of some remakes. Less fortunately, it adds little of interest to the story and fills that void in the movie with special effects that, despite the potential for the immense detail, flexibility and intrigue today's computer technology promises, come off as rather cold and empty. There are more sequences of action and suspense, but they mostly involve repetitious pursuits of Klaatu by the government and a desperate bid to save mankind from destruction that seems overextended to fill a running time that, at eleven minutes longer than the original, remains quite short but feels like an eternity. It's almost as if the world is being wiped out in real-time.In short, this remake simply leaves audiences cold.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
397,agmancuso,Keanu as Klaatu and other comical touches,4,13 December 2008,"Laughter makes the almost two hours not a total loss. But I don't think, somehow, that ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" was meant as a comedy. They must have realize however, that having John Cleese as the scientist was bound to provoke some giggles. Keanu Reeves is priceless as the wooden, expressionless alien. A great, unintentional, comic creation. Kathy Bates, in pantsuits if you please, plays the American Secretary of Defense and the whole thing doesn't have a single ingredient of the elements that made the Robert Wise original one of the classics of its genre. The visual tricks are good but repetitive and rather confusing. I must admit I wasn't bored I was just puzzled.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
398,wabus44,George W. Bush would not be this dumb,5,11 December 2008,"Talk about disappointing. This movie had a big budget and a pretty good cast. It even had a real decent premise for a hard science fiction film, having uplifted the 1951 original story. Unfortunately, it also had a clueless director, a horrible script, and some really bizarre editing decisions.Visually, there is much to like. The cinematography is actually really good. The actors are for the most part good with what they have to work with. It is, however, a bit melodramatic with absolutely no sense of humour whatsoever.There was obviously a lot of scenes that were left on the cutting room floor that might have improved things. As it is, relationships are established and discarded, or alternatively, spring from who knows where. Case in point: The Jennifer Connelly character is whisked off to a secret base with a whole bunch of other experts in science, engineering, etc. They arrive whereupon a character yells out for her to be let through a screening line and whisked away to a briefing meeting. We never find out how the lead relates to this person who pops in for the rest of the movie as some kind of moral compass. Furthermore, during that same sequence, she arrives to the briefing whereupon she sits by characters that were in the screening line. Somehow, while she took the shortcut to the briefing, those in a very long line beat her there. My guess is that there were intervening character establishment scenes that were cut.The most absurd aspects of the film involve the official response to the alien arrival. Here you have an alien object speeding toward earth at a velocity so great, that upon impact it would not just leave a crater but literally obliterate the earth. Seconds before impending impact it decelerates and makes a relatively gentle landing. This is clearly way beyond our understanding of physics, let alone our technology. So the initial response is to send out a bunch of army guys with rifles, backed up by local police with pistols. These guys would have to be way beyond stupid, and sincerely suicidal to act aggressively without provocation and with such puny manpower. The further military actions are just as illogical and harebrained.Ultimately, this movie fails to engage the viewer. It is boring. This is hard for me to say. I try really hard to promote and talk up these kinds of movies. Sure, Armageddon was dumb, but it was fun. The Day After Tomorrow was cliché ridden and of scientific claptrap but it too was fun and the characters were engaging. The only sci-fi movie that was as bad as this was The Core and at least that was a B movie to begin with. There is no excuse for this movie to not work better then it does. The only thing that stands still here is one's sense of wonder.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

This movie, having some of the best special effects I've seen on the big screen, truly had some potential to be great. Gort was phenomenal and breathtaking, I wish I could say that for the rest of the film. Another good thing of the movie was Jennifer Connelly's wonderful acting ability, her being one of the few good actors in the film. The reason why this film was so horrible was that with all of its astounding special effects, and some good direction, It lacked all the compassion and the message of peace that made the original so special. Hopefully, this heartless remake will be forgotten.Now, the idea to make a remake of The Day The Earth Stood Still is a good one. I certainly think that Hollywood needs a movie as touching as the classic original.

401,ScanlonPJ,Where was the script?,3,26 December 2009,"The cover to the DVD had the words 'The special effects are out of this world!' which sums the film up. Since cgi became cost effective and usable on second rate films - the effects have become more important than the rest of the production. More important that is, to the studios - not the viewer.From the start of the film it misses the plot. The main character (Jennifer Connelly) is totally devoid of any dimension. It seems she has only one purpose in existence, and that's to be a part of this film i.e. she is unbelievable. Again we have to have an annoying young brat that is shoehorned into the story line to try and pull things together - only this time worst than usual.The opening sequence should really serve as a warning - as the scientists are brought together, and flown to the impact point, it all seems entirely forgettable. Something just doesn't click - there is no chemistry. The action is there, but who cares? This wasn't a bad film, there are worst. But that does not excuse this production.

402,Elspode,"Vile, Insipid, Boring - A Travesty",2,22 June 2009,"The worst thing about this ""remake"" is that they hung the name of *the* classic 50's sci-fi film on it. The new ""Day"" has virtually nothing in common with the original save for a few character names and the general notion of an alien coming to Earth to make us do something we were unwilling to do ourselves.The film is so low key, it is hard to believe it was even written. Everyone sleepwalks through their parts, perhaps taking a cue from Reeves, who generates about as much excitement in this film as does the ingredient list on a box of Cream of Wheat. Virtually *nothing* happens in this movie. There is no sense of tension, no dramatic unfolding of plot. You couldn't possibly care less about any of the sketchily drawn characters - it is perhaps revealing that Gort, the now giant robot weapon system, has more personality than all the other characters in the film rolled together...and he doesn't speak. Even the numerous helicopters in the movie are CGI, and they *still* have more personality than Reeves.This remake is a classic example of Hollywood, bereft of ideas, trying to profit on name recognition and fond memories. Even the ""you're ruining the planet and killing yourselves"" theme of the film is less threatening than a warm, purring kitten. I can't even work up the energy to be offended at how this bland, vapid remake lifted superficial details from the original, because it is so utterly unlike the earlier, vastly, vastly, VASTLY better original.I paid one dollar to rent this film from a Redbox.

403,rcp02,Really really bad and insulting remake of excellent 50's classic,4,1 May 2009,"Hollywood has been remaking a lot of movies lately with usually terrible results, and this is no exception. The scriptwriter has taken the original script, and rewrote it while apparently stoned or on coke. The original movie has an extremely clear storyline with no idiotic story twists, no decidedly crazy and astronomically improbable behavior like this one has in spades, and is excellent from first moment to last. This piece of sputum on the other hand will let you feel like you want to bash the characters heads in half of the time for being so stupid and outrageously insane. The most pathetic part of this movie is the fact that despite having state of the art special effects it can't hold a candle to the original, which had hardly any effects whatsoever, never mind special ones.True, it is not completely abysmal like , say , the day after tomorrow, and has at times decent acting. But good actors like John Cleese for instance are completely wasted in this movie, and even Reeves and Connely perform like wooden dolls at times. I won't spoil the end to you; I don't need to, it is bad enough that it will spoil itself.Script: Zero .. Done by a chimp and two stray dogs taken from the streets.

404,The_Film_Addict,Fans of the original will be disappointed with Scott Derrickson's retelling of Robert Wise's 1951 science-fiction classic...,6,4 January 2009,"Fans of the original will be disappointed with Scott Derrickson's retelling of Robert Wise's 1951 science-fiction classic The Day the Earth Stood Still. What begins as a masterfully constructed ominous opening soon descends into a world of eye-popping computer wizardry and regurgitated clichés. Though the original may be far from perfect, it did manage to craft a powerful, poignant message about humanity's desperate need to reshape society. It's a shame that message can't be found in this commercially endorsed remake.When a mysterious unidentified object begins to make its way towards earth, a team of scientists, including Dr. Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly), are called to investigate the finding. Thought to be an object of catastrophic proportions, a mysterious, glowing orb slowly descends onto New York's Central Park. Once landed and surrounded by a team of cautious scientists and military personal, Klaatu (Keanu Reeves), an alien with an urgent message to world leaders, is shot on sight. Lacking mobility, the vulnerable alien is taken and treated for injuries at a secret lab where government officials, including Secretary of State Regina Jackson (Kathy Bates), seize the opportunity to interrogate the meaning behind his visitation. Fearing hostile government intervention towards Klaatu, Dr. Helen Benson, along with her stepson Jacob Benson (Jayden Smith), help Klaatu escape the clutches of government officials and assist the alien with a grim message make his way to world leaders.The problem with The Day the Earth Stood Still isn't that it's a bad movie; it's just not a very good one. Due to its lack of awe-inspiring science-fiction story telling, what's supposed to be a mesmerizing movie going experience turns into something that's just another day at the multiplex. It's hard to discus the remake without comparing it to its superior predecessor because during a time when the nation was drowned in paranoia about the possibility of a nuclear war, Robert Wise's 1951 original contained a reflective, thought provoking message about humans' desperate need to be at peace with one another. Though the ideas in Derrickson's remake are important, due to the film's turbo charged pacing and uneven ending, the film's message gets lost in its world of computer animated effects and Keanu Reeves' stone cold persona.Like M. Night Shyamalan's ridiculous 2008 feature, The Happening, director Scott Derrickson's retelling is also a cautionary tale of humans' lack of environmentalism awareness. Klaatu must have been extremely bothered by Al Gore's documentary An Inconvenient Truth to have to travel light years in space to warn humans of their impending doom. Though the film means well; the film's overall effect is lost in its mediocre execution. As in Steven Spielberg's impressive 2005 apocalyptic feature, War of the Worlds, screenwriter David Scarpa places the film's characters in ""been there, done that"" territory. Instead of focusing on the film's message, Still gets quickly sidetracked by its strained family relationship storyline.With a second feature already under his belt, Jayden Smith, once again, showcases immense capability for acting. Too bad his screen character is annoying. Keanu Reeves, who seems slightly emotionless in all his performances, hits a home run with Klaatu. He was born to play that role. Screen giants Jennifer Connelly and Kathy Bates make the film interesting and watchable. Without them, the film has nothing.If Fox would have respected sacred ground, The Day the Earth Stood Still would have been a winner. Not to completely discredit the film, it is something nice to look at; however, look too long and you'll eventually get bored.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

The modernization and effects are good in the re-make and it explored similar themes that made the original film interesting, but ultimately the re-make failed on two key points: the storyline with Gort was completely changed in the re-make, and the climax of the film (the ""Earth standing still"" part) was given cursory treatment in the new film, like an afterthought at the end of the movie. This was a huge mistake for the re-make -- botching the climax and central event of the entire film.There were some genuinely touching scenes near the end of the new movie (featuring mother, child, and Klaatu) and I was ready to give the new movie the benefit of the doubt if it had kept intact the climax from the original (and the sober warning that went with it) as well as the Gort storyline.

If Klaatu was an alien and can connect to machines, why the hell can't he get a car or a bike or a plane to fly him back to the park? Or why can't he get the robot to come to him? And if you want a human to pass off as an alien, at least get him to act like one. This is one of Keanu's worst movies.

412,donot_forget-remember_me,..I think i expected too much !,4,3 March 2009,A remake of the 1951 classic sci-fi film which never should have been made at first place about an alien visitor and his giant robot counterpart who visit Earth. The movie left out with a lot of questions in the end. No doubt the special effects are good enough but that can't fill the blocked plot of the movie. As a whole if you really want to go see this film do not expect anything out of it than you might not disappoint at the end. Performance wise it was okay. jennifer connely looked awesome in the movie. Still wondering what happened at the end of the movie? Was there any message for us? Did aliens find us okay the way we are. Finally because i didn't expect anything i would give it 4 out of 10 other than that this movie should not deserve more than 4 that too i have become lenient keeping the star cast of the movie in mind.,The Day the Earth Stood Still
413,Blacklumix,Darker is not better....,6,15 December 2008,"The money shot for most of us who enjoy the 1951 film (I won't call it a ""version"") is ""Klaatu Varada/Barada (depending on what you hear) nikto!"" where we all learn that Gort is really OK. We forgave how Gort could possibly have escaped detection rescuing Klaatu and returning him to the spaceship in the middle of DC because the story was relatively simple and straightforward, was essentially positive and non-violent and, like most of the films of its genre and vintage, ended with a question mark (literally or figuratively). Here I think even the director got lost with too much going on, and for me the ending left little doubt in my mind what the future would hold, giving me little solace despite the ending. One of the keys to the success or failure of this movie should have been how the characters change and/or evolve in the face of their coming into contact with each other and the revelation of alien's real mission. Instead for me it fell really short as changes of heart, so to speak, just appeared like ""ta das"" out of nowhere. For those who love to watch the government (and especially the military) arrogantly flounder, flail and fail, however, there's plenty of that. Compared with a very camp 1951 story, I just don't think this ""version"" will stand the test of time, still or otherwise. Comparing disaster films I would put ""The Day After Tomorrow"" heads and shoulders over this one, in every category including special effects (the CGI here was really somewhat cheesy).",The Day the Earth Stood Still
414,darricklin,"Overall, the acting is good & the effects are great",8,21 June 2011,"I would think that this movie should have authenticated the US Chain-of-Command a bit better. There are valuable lessons to be learned from this movie about who we are as a human race. Keanu Reeves & Jennifer Connelly played their part very well, but I would expect that from a very famous actor & actress. Kathy Bates annoyed the heck out of me, but that is not from bad acting, rather that seemed to be her role in the movie. She has been a super-star in other films. I think Jaden Smith will be a great actor if he continues to develop and hone his skill in the film industry, but I am not sure this was the best fit for this type of movie. I am probably being over analytical, so I gave it a good 8-out-of-10.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
415,Berserker_swe,"America, oh you are so great",4,12 December 2008,"This comment contains spoilers ! And a lot of nagging =) I have not seen the original but i looked forward to this movie since i like sci-fi. And it started of fair enough, all the worlds (meaning USA) masterminds are summoned because something is traveling at high speed towards earth. They are basically told that the earth is about to be destroyed within 76minutes.Why these masterminds needed to hear this, or why the military is preparing for an assault of mass proportion (when they think its a meteorite) is never explained.So far, the mood of the movie is good with only a few question marks. And it doesn't get much more complicated either. The basic story of the movie is still good and interesting. But everything seems to be a big commercial about how great USA is instead of the vulnerabilities of the human kind.It turns out that the thing which were about to collide with earth landed instead. Obviously in central Manhattan USA. No other objects were found by whatever system that detected this one, yet they say that these kind of gigantic orbs have landed all over earth (but who cares).Anyways, they capture an alien who knows the English language and everything about humankind because they have taken control over American satellites.The captured alien wants to meet with all of earth leaders but his wishes are denied by the vice president or some other extension of the president of USA. He will only need to speak to the president of USA (off course !).Furthermore the DNA collected from the alien will not be analyzed for decades, since it's now property of the USA.This movie is full of this sort of commercials/propaganda and it does nothing for the story. Also, there is product placement for at least McDonalds, Honday (the car), LG (phone service), Microsoft Windows, and probably many more.What we learn from movies from Hollywood is the following: * If a disaster is threatening to the humankind the epicenter will be in America for some reason. * If the disaster is some kind of attack it will be towards America cause that's were it would hurt mankind the most off-course. * Where ever and/or whatever the disaster is, it will be solved by America(ns).I am no ""USA-hater"", people may think that America is the greatest nation of earth, maybe it's so. I don't know, it's possible. I just don't like it when movies aim towards this. Its almost as if there's kind of board in the movie industry which have to acknowledge the movies and check so that there's enough USA-love in it. Anyway all the above comments are annoying features of the film, but it's still rather enjoyable to watch. I saw it on its premier and i don't think it's worth paying for, i give it a four (4) out of ten (10) Klatuu was believable and graphics OK, that's all. I'd would have liked to know more about the origin of the aliens ""community of nations"" and in what way humankind was destroying itself (climate, religion or war ??).",The Day the Earth Stood Still
416,cuteasfunk,Oh! My God!,5,8 June 2009,"I will not write a bad review of this movie per se.....there are plenty of other bad reviews with which I agree. I want to say that this movie summarises everything that is good and bad about American mainstream cinema. First, why allow the director to remake a 50 year old film that was quite good in its day? Sure the director always wanted to make the film...but why give him $80m to indulge his ego....(He must have thought he could improve it?). But actually when the original was made...it was a fabulous concept that the aliens came down without wanting to destroy us......we need a new scenario.....Secondly, Hollywood seems to be run by accountants and this is an accountant's movie. Just enough costly special effects and stars to warrant the promo budget.....but not enough thought into the story/plot. Anyone who has seen the Altman film ""The Player"" will also recognise the ""pitch lines"" that probably went with this film....""War of the Worlds where the Aliens care about the planet....""...""Keanu Reeve in the Matrix, only this time he is from an Alien Matrix that wants to destroy our false world"". Whatever it was, some money people bought it. I don't know why Hollywood executives feel they have to discourage originality.....? My understanding is that most films make their money back eventually. I suppose it is difficult. The world film audiences are a very varied bunch. Those who love action, those who love ""cgi"" and special effects, those who want character development, those who want a ""message"".To develop that thought further. If you have a spare $100m to invest in movies...you can get some movie stars, you can get some special effects....if the story were not a remake....most of us would have given this a better rating....did they commission the remake to help sell the film?...if so, then the remake may have sold it to get bums on seats, but it made the film watching experience all the poorer. What if they had remade the film but took it to a totally different place....? What if they remade the film and ""reduced"" the special effects but increased the plot twists and had a seriously challenging ending.....?I wonder if all the people who have commented negatively on this movie could have done a better job of getting the director to produce a better movie....Hey Hollywood!....try asking real film fans about how to make a film instead of relying on greedy, cocaine drenched, egomaniacs....those numpties must be the cinema equivalent of banking executives....except what would we as the audience feel if they actually over-risked occasionally....if more of the films they commissioned actually did something different with cinema and took a chance?I know that only occasionally does a left field film come out that goes mainstream...but $80m for no good reason...honestly....when does someone say enough is enough.

I couldn't be a negative nancy watching this with my boyfriend (Keanu lover as well), so I had to forcibly snatch any redeemable qualities for discussion. To be honest, nothing stood out. The concept of Aliens learning about humans is such an interesting theme but was wasted in this movie. Keanu is this type of ""Terminator"" sent to destroy earth that a scientist lady trusted bringing her child along in the journey. This is basically Terminator 2 but with a smoother Swatzernegger and less badassery. I think I fell asleep or my boyfriend and I ended up doing something else; either way, we didn't bother rewinding the movie for the parts we missed. And no matter how long you are gone, you didn't miss much. Keanu always has this subtle charm which we stuck around for. My bf hated Jaden Smith's snobby performance, though.

420,mr_Goodbomb,One of the worst big-budget movies I've ever seen... Maybe the worst,1,11 December 2008,"I'm seen some lousy movies before. I've seen some pretty stupid adaptations and some really crappy remakes (Night of the Living Dead 3D, anyone?). But this takes the cake. Considering the talent involved, the obvious money spent, and the public hype surrounding this flick... It was god-awful.Plan 9 From Outer Space has serious competition for ""worst film of all time,"" if you take budget and acting talent into consideration. How such a tanker can be made with such a big price tag and several skilled names attached is far, far beyond me. How someone (the actors, the CGI animators, ANYONE!) didn't take notice of any of the glaring plot holes or absolute lack of a real ending... Sweet pampered baby Jesus. Someone must have taken notice, though, because it seems, at some point, everyone stopped caring. The CGI was disgusting... I'm no fan of CGI, but I know sometimes, with the combination of the way a story and shot list are written and the global expectations people put on modern films, it's necessary to carry out an idea. I've seen better CGI implemented in student productions. NOTHING looked believable, and it looked as if the animators didn't even bother to try to make it so. The dialog was terrible and clunky, and the story (and ending) were so insufficient and full of holes that it's astounding it even got put out. There WAS no real ending... Millions dead, cities destroyed, and a world covered in a fine sand of mechanical space-bugs. Then what? The director didn't even put his name at the end, or any other associated ""big"" names, it went straight to smaller production people. Most likely? Because they were ashamed.And I won't even bother comparing it to the original. While dated, I'm watching the original as I type this, and it's become a bit corny and campy with age, but it's whimsy and wonder, and given message, is still shining after half a decade.

422,akeanefan,"This film is much better than what the negative reviewers are saying, and here's why....",8,14 December 2008,"Once again, Hollywood makes yet another remake of a classic film, and while most attempts at this have been utter disasters, this remake of ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" is a rare exception to this rule and deserves far more praise than what is being displayed by the negative reviews here on IMDb. First, the scenario is equally as chilling as the original: Alien visitors arrive to Earth, this time in beautiful, yet ominous looking sphere-shaped spacecraft. The first lands in the middle of central park in New York city and thus begins a very realistic, and intense standoff between humans and the new arrivals. The anticipation was superb and anyone who was not sitting on the edge of their seat during this part was either a.) Stoned b.) Had no pulse or C.) Both. Second, the acting was brilliant, especially on the part of Kuneau Reeves as Klaatu, as well as Jennifer Connely and Kathy Bates. Very convincing performances that truly grabbed the attention of the audience. Finally, the story was a wonderful wake-up call for humanity without being ""preachy"" as some of the negative reviewers complained and you actually walk out of the theater with quite a bit to think about. It's nice to see something from the current world of entertainment that is actually intellectually stimulating, especially from the realm of science fiction. Any director can have aliens blow up the world, but the director of this film blew our minds with a deep and meaningful plot. Also, I would like to add that, contrary to what negative reviewers have said, this film was not Al Gore in a cheap suit and did not contain anything about global warming. This was a fact that I was actually dreading due to the fact that I am sick of hearing global warming being crammed down our throats. I even thought to myself as I walked into the movie theater that if this film even mentions the phrase ""global warming"", then I am prepared to walk out of the theater. Thankfully, however, it didn't and, needless to say, that was a relief. In conclusion I just want to say that while everyone is entitled to their opinion, I also feel that many of the negative reviewers of this film were a bit harsh in their judgments and sometimes I wonder if some of these negative reviewers, who really act like self-proclaimed critics, aren't just like that overweight comic book guy from ""The Simpsons"" with no life and with nothing better to do than to hack to pieces a decent film. No offense intended to anyone, but the vitriol being spewed by some of the negative reviewers really makes me think that the afore mentioned point is the case.Is this film a masterpiece? No. However, it does hold a candle to the original quite well and is definitely worth a viewing.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
423,Robston,Awards are sure to follow.,1,11 December 2008,"It's always tricky with remakes particularly as those who like the original will always be critical of the newcomer however well intentioned and efficiently made.I have no issues with Hollywood exploring its vaults as long as the eventual film is entertaining and is value for money - a Cape Fear or Oceans Eleven. However taking the plot from an old movie and adding a few modern special effects hoping it will work is simply just not enough. Compound the problem by having a script that draws on every sci-fi cliché in the book, have a soundtrack that constantly reminds you that 'danger is near' or 'something creepy is about to happen', and ensure that the lead roles are just stereotype after stereotype after stereotype, and you get, probably, the worst movie I have seen in years.The plot has Keanu Reeves being abducted/simulated in the past, not sure which, then along with a big old earth like globe he lands in Central Park in the modern day. The Government is weary of the UFO and therefore utilises the military to prepare for an attack whilst observing the alien. The alien now morphs into Keanu Reeves, who was accompanied by a giant robot like being that stays in the Park. Is he and the big globe here to help us or to kill us all? Well, yes that's basically it. There's a lot of shooting, by the military, a bit of soul searching by the scientists, an adopted young boy with issues with parenting, the kids mother who is important enough to bypass security checks at military control centres. I'm sorry, I can't go on with this drivel.In summary Keanu Reeves is just a piece of talking wood, Jennifer Connelly spends most of the movie saying 'give us a second chance, we can change!!' - saying it once is poignant, say it a dozen times and it's just irritating. I feel sorry for Oscar winner Kathy Bates who plays the Government official who has to make all the tough decisions but is a tortured soul in the process, yes the role really is that shallow, her agent should be shot for their involvement in her taking the role.As pointless as a movie gets adding nothing new to the sci-fi genre.Oh and those awards I mentioned, the 29th Annual Razzie Awards, expect the mantelpiece to be full.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
424,ckcckc-84227,Give up all hope...,2,9 August 2021,"...that Hollywood will ever produce a re-make better than the original. Hollywood only does re-makes so they can dumb-down content to a level comprehensible to the contemporary US mainstream, and to cash in on money-making potential garnered from past glories.The 1951 film was a good story, well scripted and shot, albeit within the SFX capabilities of its time. A classic in its genre, it still holds up today as a good yarn with strong characters and plausible narrative.Fast forward to 2008 and all you'll get for your money is popcorn-spilling SFX; plot threads which don't lead anywhere; tick-box black and female representation in lead roles (Kathy Bates was a welcome dose of common sense early on; but by the end of the movie the imminent destruction of humanity is still being presided over by the U. S. Vice-President's deputy? Who doesn't have a clue; so let's just place our faith in someone with no relevant credentials nor any actual plan).There's a painful product placement sequence mid-movie which I will not dwell on.The real issue with this film is that if you hadn't seen the proper version you would have no idea at all what was going on. When a U. S. soldier shoots Klaatu in the '51 film, it is easy to comprehend why; in the '08 scene there seems no plausible justification for it. What does the opening sequence in the mountains tell us other than that ""they've been here before""? What actually happens in this film? And what convinces Klaatu to change his mind, other than lots of meaningful looks? What are these various lame-looking soldiers doing, randomly shooting weapons at Gort? Sorry, it just doesn't work.If one scene best illustrates the gap, it's the blackboard scene with (curiously) John Cleese cast as a ""leading scientist"". In the original we understand that the prof. Is working on equations connected to inter-galactic travel, and that Klaatu has some relevant knowledge to bring to the work. The writing on the board looks plausibly complex, and when Klaatu corrects it the prof. Asks a pertinent question and receives a plausible reply, pretty much like scientists might talk to each other. In the remake it looks more like the kind of maths I did at school and nobody actually tries to explain what the prof. Is working on. ""Something difficult"" we guess. Rather than take the science route it is dumbed down to a little dance of writing hands, correcting and responding; nice try but it conveys nothing of any meaning. Klaatu knows more than prof is all we can take away from the scene. Dumb science for dumb audiences.Sorry, this film stinks. Next please...",The Day the Earth Stood Still
425,hmmod9,World Exclusive: J S Bach saves world from Aliens and Madeline Albright,1,13 December 2008,"This film was completely empty and boring and wasn't saved by some good special effects. The story was unoriginal (not referring to the 1951 version) in that we have had an overabundance of these catastrophic humanity-on-the-edge-of-extinction baloney types, that one would think that U.S. film and T.V. makers are trying to promulgate and copper fasten an ever impending attack psyche among Americans, convincing them of imminent attacks from either aliens or human terrorist types, for whatever reason or other  you can make up your own mind. Personally, I think that we don't have to worry about aliens eradicating us, as humans will do that job unaided - but that's another story. Firstly, if the aliens obviously knew what kind of half-arsed job we humans had made of things so why land here at all, why not blow the proverbial out of us from space? For all their advanced technology, they lacked the basics of extinction warfare. And the way that the giant bodyguard dissolved into a scrillion little robotic metal-eaters, what was that all about? Also, the small arks that took away all other life forms to, presumably, return them at a later stage, surely it would have been easier to hypnotise the humans, take them away and leave everything else rather than eating the crap out of all and sundry? And what about Klaatu, rethinking his hideous mission, after seeing a few unconvincing tears and hearing a bit of tinkling of a Bach tune, so therefore the whole years-in-the-planning operation is gone for a Burton. As pathetic as the story was what about the acting, especially Mr. Reeves who after all, plays a half robot but still managed to convince me that his other half was a robot as well, and could John Cleese have been any more of a stereotype wearing a cardigan that must have came from a small flock of sheep, sporting a pair of absent-minded slippers, having a strategic blackboard in the sitting room, listening to Bach in a house needing a bloody good clean-up.

426,andymcguckin,An opportunity Lost,2,15 December 2008,"I so wanted this film to be different from other remakes and be decent rendition of either the original 1951 film or the short story 'Farewell to the Master,' but it was neither. Adding superior effects does not make a better movie because, 'The Day the Earth Stood Still,' is a movie with a message and the message was lost in this hopeless remake.As humans we have to learn to understand our way out of problems rather than use violence to change hearts and minds and as we eventually reach other planets and stars other possible Alien races would see us as a terrible threat to peace. This film does ably illustrate this as the first reaction in the film is to shoot and bomb anything that moves and the military characters are flat idiotic caricatures. The Politicians are just as bad, they are badly drawn and unlike most 'real' politicians have no concept of negotiation or bargaining that would be the case in the real world. The original film had the secretary of defence as an apologist for human immaturity and our propensity for violence. This film has violence on both Klaatu's side and the human side and this displays the message that violence is necessary when it is not.Klaatu is a portrayed as a violent entity and a harbinger of destruction whereas in the original film violence in all its forms was abhorred and Gort was the ultimate weapon against this violence not Klaatu.The actors in this movie were unconvincing with no real empathy for the situation although to be fair the script is terrible with all characters being caricatures with no depth. The secretary is a caricature based on Condeleezza Rice who is known to be hawkish in her attitude is one example.This film fails to convince due to an awful script, poor acting and direction that loses the message that we as humans need to change before we destroy our environment and ourselves; also that we will not be allowed to export our violent nature to other star systems.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Another equally important message being delivered is to take care of our planet and stop ""killing"" it.I think the vast majority of the cast did a great job with the acting, and the directing and cinematography were also good or at least acceptable in my personal opinion as a movie watcher. All in all, I would give the movie at least seven stars, and wouldn't give it higher because there is something wrong with the movie. I can't quite put my hand on it, but I think it has to do with missing parts. It's like something's missing. Perhaps the boy's character needed a bit more time at the very beginning, some scenes needed to be justified more properly or convincingly...something like that.Oh, not a lot of ""wow"" factor in the special effects, but the sfx already there was done very nicely.

I also felt this way about the new ""War of the Worlds"", i think that a much better movie could be made if they took out the children.

Let me make myself clearthe original Day is better than this movie. It is better written and executed. But I must also say that I really enjoyed this movie. The point of Klaatu coming was changed a bit, from a message to a mission, but I feel that there was enough here to justify the remake. People are hating this movie for a few reasons, one of which being the question: why would an alien care if we destroy ourselves and this planet. Well they answer this, Klaatu says that there are very few worlds that can sustain intelligent and complex life, and we should not destroy the one we have. Other say this is an environmental messagewe it is and it isn't. We can destroy the earth in several ways, not just pollution. So this is not a green peace movie. And yes, I know the movie has product placement etc. But I mean what movie doesn't. They had to pay for GORT some way, and oh man, they got their money's worth. This new Gort is one of the best robots I have seen in any film! I loved him. I wish there was more of him, but then again, I thought they would only show 1 second, so I'm glad I was wrong. I do wish it was Gort doing more of the destruction than Mistified-Gortbut what can you do. The message in the movie wasn't clear to audience or the people of earth, but I think the message was that we will change, but only when we are pushed to the extreme. We have to be on the brink, in order to really change who we are. And that was verbalized in the film, so there's your message. Klaatu will come back to finish the job if we don't. I feel that this movie deserves at least one view if not a few views. The old film did a great job of hammering in the message it wanted to statethis one is a bit more subtle. You have pay attention and take from it what you will. Some are comparing to the original, which is always the case with a remake, but I think this film can stand on it's own as a good sci-fi picture, without being bashed on by people who don't take the time to think after a movie and just say ""it sucks"".",The Day the Earth Stood Still

They elect to use as a conduit Keanu Reeves, who is eerily similar to Al Gore in two ways, both men are pale with black hair and both men are capable of two emotions, disinterest and monotony. Of course before Keanu can open a dialog a soldier (obviosuly a Republican and NRA member) shoots him insensitively. Now we are doomed, because the aliens have a robot named GORT who is eerily similar to Al Gore in two ways, his name (coincidence? I don't think so)and secondly his emotional range, anyways, this GORT can destroy us all, even the PETA people. We learn we are now marked for destruction from a space-Chinaman in a McDonalds on the New Jersey Turnpike. Of course.So the government calls in an extraterrestial biologist (I would love to get a job teaching at Princeton (not Harvard Roger Ebert, it's near to New York City, get a map dude for all they pay you)about a subject that has no proof or manifestations other than drunk lonely people in the middle of nowhere claiming to be abducted- thousands of years ago this was called religion)this biologist is Jennifer Conolly, who fails stunningly to take off her clothes which would have achieved two things, first it would have saved Earth instantly and second it would have saved the movie at the box office (or at least assured my purchase of the DVD-but I digress). No, instead she keeps herself clothed, and the Earth hangs in the balance while we try and change Al Gore's mind by inducing positive emotions through 1)the music of Bach (he forgot to say ""Ah Bach"" here but the book Dirk Gently's Holistic Detetcive Agency already had a Bach moment with a space alien),2) doing serious math with a Monty Pythoner and finally 3)being impressed at how, with the destruction of her entire species imminent, the hot scientist lady does not beat the s** out of her obnoxious stepson (who for some reason, is the little black kid from Holes I think someone should call the California Child Labor Board and check that kid for diet pills that stunt his growth).So there you have it, a more violent version of the movie Starman with some Matrix and Equilibrium thrown in (curiously Roger Ebert's review on that movie mistook jazz for the opening chords of Beethoven's Ninth, you'd think with all the prentensious literary references he makes he'd know the single-most acclaimed piece of music ever!). For all its intensity and production value, the movie has some strange points. If you were going to monitor what you thought was a cataclysmic impact on the island of Manhattan would you really put your most capable people in a helicopter flying right next to that island at the moment of impact? Would highly trained government operatives leave an alien alone in a room with a lie-detector and only one questioner? For that matter, when their earpieces became shatteringly loud with static would not one of those highly trained operatives have taken their earpiece out? Not a bad movie, but the whole thing was eerily similar to Al Gore in two ways, the fate of the protagonsits (in the movie it was humanity in real life Al Gore the poltician) was decided by the emotional stability of others, and despite its obvious conviction it failed to convinvce you.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
433,stephen-560-161818,not as bad as some are saying,6,21 October 2009,"OK, I got page 4 of the comments here and stopped I'm going to set myself up for a slating here, but did any of the detractors actually bother to re-watch the original before posting... I did. I wanted to give the remake a fair crack at the whip. I will for fairness leave out the problems of technical effects in discussing this.What I'm going to try and do is give a comparative and fair study of the two.The film is not as bad as they are making out... its not a gem, but its no worse than the original... which equally is not a great film when all is said and done. Its a classic for its time yes, but even taking into account everything its not great from an objective point of view.The new film makes for an interesting viewpoint of changes in social awareness of focus however. whereas the original focused on the fear of nuclear destruction, the remake focuses on more general environmental problems. And gives a slightly if not much believable account for Klatu being involved.The film is indeed mired by the 'kid' who is an obnoxious little brat, however I see similar every day on the street, so its plainly believable even if I want the little prat to be gagged and dragged off set at times. The kid in the original is adorable and more watchable but I can;t help thinking that he is plainly unrealistic idealised child.For that matter, the woman as portrayed on the original is an unthinking classic old Hollywood screamer, plainly sexist and unrealistic, whilst the remake shows a much more realistic woman. I'm going to leave that there I think. I will just say that comments about a white woman having a black kid are totally ridiculous. It was made clear that she wasn't his blood mother in the film... the commenter obviously wasn't paying attention. Keanu plays Klatu OK, but I have to agree that the original was more likable, however Keanu was more alien. Too many times in the original Klatu came out with colloquialisms which made him seem too human, which unlike the remake was not supposed to be the case even by DNA. whereas in the remake they used human DNA to create a vessel into which their alien consciousness could be hosted. That said they don't fully explain the reasons for this in the remake.The robot in the original is fundamentally not scary, it is slightly more scary in the remake but not much. however the reaction of the crowd in the original on its appearance does not make any sense, whereas comparatively it does in the remake. I am sorry this is not just effects. Its the fact that a robot walking out of the door, unless you have prescience would not make a crowd retreat any more than an alien in a space suit , until it offered violence. Its little things like this which really mar the original for me.conversely the appearance on Klatu makes more sense in the original, the reason for the blubber suit is not clear in the remake and there is no sense to it. surely he could have been born from the suit before leaving the ship, thus making a much more acceptable appearance.One bit which makes no sense in the remake yet made much more in the original is the denial of access to the UN. Yes we know that allegedly the US have little respect for the UN, but still its not the cold war anymore. Furthermore surely video conferencing would have been possible.... anyway.the destruction of the earth by mechanical locusts in the remake was a nice touch back to the plagues of Egypt I thought, although the're emergence was farcical as was the manner in which things were destroyed. As a whole I thought both films were a success providing one is willing to ignore certain fundamental flaws. The remake is by no means terrible in converse to some opinions, providing one doesn't go in with blinkers to the originals flaws.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

A good indication of a good film is if time flies and at the end you are left feeling enlightened and uncheated. On both accounts i was surprisingly pleased.No this will not win any Oscars, it will not smash box office records. It was and will remain a very enjoyable film and worth a trip to the theatre on a cold and dark winters night.As far as i am concerned this is the best Sci Fi film this year.

440,rbangert,"Respects and extends the original--good story, well done",9,13 December 2008,"Since I was a boy, I've always loved the 1951 movie, The Day the Earth Stood Still. Of course, as I've aged, the special effects that once seemed so compelling in the original now look amateurish. And the original seems heavy-handed in its message, complete with a rather patronizing speech at the end.This remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still does a number of things well. It stays faithful to the original story, both in general theme (about humans acting irresponsibly according to a cosmic standard) and down to details (even names of characters and specific scenes). But it isn't a tired rehash... it adds depth of character and explores plot lines and technological details that were left undeveloped in the original. It turns the original plot enough to keep everyone guessing. Certainly the special effects were extraordinarily improved, which made the story more believable. And it delivers its cautionary moral about human responsibility (and redeemability) in a far less preachy way. I thought the acting was terrific--somewhat understated throughout, but that added to the realism. Keanu Reeves is a bit wooden throughout, but that seemed appropriate to a super- rational extraterrestrial. Jennifer Connelly did a great job balancing the role of scientist and emotional heart to the movie. In short, compelling story, great special effects, exciting interludes, good acting--an enjoyable movie that went by fast. We had two teens with us who thought the movie was great-- some of the scenes might be scary for kids, though.Highly recommended!",The Day the Earth Stood Still

I""m sorry what's that you say? The Earth is cooling now? Oh... uh... OK... then the fallacy of 'Global Climate Change' (that way we can blame carbon emissions, cow farts, and SUVs for ANY climate change up or down) as the justification for our extinction. All the other animals on planet Earth get the 'Noah's Ark' treatment from the benevolent Aliens, but not us evil humans... apparently we missed the memo and torqued off said Aliens. The Aliens strut around our planet, judging us to be unworthy (like it is their planet or something) with all the emotion and passion of a three toed tree sloth. Wait a sec... maybe it is their planet... were we seeded here? Intelligent design? Who knows. The movie doesn't address that sticky topic. I say we blame the Indians (dot, not feather) and the Chinese. They aren't buying their fair share of carbon credits. The Alien even rides around with a 'responsible' scientist who drives a Hybrid no less (it would be hypocritical for an advanced being destroying us for our carbon emissions to get escorted around in an Escalade, right?). Product placements galore! There is also some heavy anti-military overtones in the movie... the little kid's dead father would kick the alien's butts if he wasn't... uh... dead. Because he was in the Army... and they kill stuff... you know, 'cuz they're the Army. *sigh* There were so many holes in the plot and silly leaps in logic it was ridiculous.This ranks as the second worst Sci-fi movie of all time (narrowly beaten out by the slaughtering of L.

I don't usually get into alien movies, but I knew this was based on a classic and the special effects looked good, so I told me brother I would go see it with him.I was right about one thing; the special effects are phenomenal. That alone gave these movie a three out of ten in my book. The rest of this film was absolutely dreadful. The story may have been relevant in 1951, but it does not hold up.The acting was mediocre at best, though Keanu Reeves playing a robot-like alien is probably a great casting choice, as every character he does seems pretty robotic. Jennifer Connelly is a fine actress, but only so much can be done with a script like this. Same goes for John Hamm; I like him, but the script was just horrid and brought everyone down.So to conclude, this movie is complete garbage, easily the worst I have seen in quite some time.

I found myself hoping that his character would find his fate before the end of the film, but sadly this wasn't to happen. I can only hope for Will's sake he isn't like this at home.I personally think the aliens should have finished the job they started. To think that Connelly's character could convince a higher life-form that her entire species can change is simply insulting.And what about McDonald's, didn't they get a good deal! One thing I can't stand is bloody product placement. I go to the movies so I don't have to deal with the commercial garbage on TV, and what do I get??? Bloody Maccas.Other insults included:1: Conveniently finding a telephone, and making it work by touching it with a finger. 2: USA centred - the aliens landing in Manhattan (of course), with only a few token mentions of other civilizations around the world who also happened to be affected. 3: The endless 'classified' jargon (the only thing that should have been classified was this damn film).Now I'm getting really stressed here just thinking about this. The reason I gave this movie 4 out of 10 (a generous mark considering my comments), is because of the good special effects, the important message that it tried to convey and the fact that I'm an easy marker overall.All in all, I hope something better arrives soon to restore my faith in postmodern cinema.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

The idea of an alien coming to earth, as far as I can figure, being the first alien encounter for mankind is intriguing. The acting and the special effects are good, and I like Keanu Reeves from before so it was fun to see another movie with him.But there were some things that just didn't agree with me very well. I think the major problem, for me, was that there were too many questions left unanswered. Or perhaps it was just me missing the point? But either way I had a hard time fully understanding the alien protagonist and his intentions. Not to mention the motives behind those intentions. That he somehow had the authority to do as he saw fit didn't make much sense to me. Who was he and his race to decide over a planet that isn't theirs? I would have wanted a deeper meaning here. I would have wanted more of a backstory to the alien and what he was up to. And as to the people's reaction, or most of the people anyway... well, that made me almost ashamed to be human.

This remake has assembled a handful of very good sequences. And, like the original, I enjoyed a great deal of the ""implied science-fiction"".

Ever since his performance in ""The Devil's Advocate""(1997), he has done his job in portraying his characters very, very well. Hangin' out with Al Pacino can do that. The highly-argued and debated ""Constantine""(2005) sold me on his ability as an actor.

It all looked like a faithful translation of the original's plot, characters and themes into a contemporary setting. With the original's Cold War angst successfully replaced by modern-day fears about global warming and terrorism. The opening scenes; Klaatu's arrival, introduction and wounding, Gort's menacing new look, the genuine sense of alien menace coming from our intrepid alien duo and their mysterious ""spacecraft"". It all went together fantastically. But then...they began fiddling with the plot too much. Suddenly, Klaatu isn't a messenger of peace and reason any more. Instead of his iconic lesson of humility which gave the original movie both much of its impact and its name, he now just wants to wipe us all out with swarming nanotechnology...kill....things... After the first third, the movie also starts to descent into the tired old ""we'll resolve our family problems while the world ends"" routine we've already seen in far too many films. The character's motivations and actions also become more and more awkward and even contradictory as the film progresses. At one point, Klaatu kills a police trooper, then brings him back to life, despite planning to destroy the entire human race. When asked about this, he mumbles something about ""not meaning the trooper any harm"". Eh, what? Apparently planning to kill off someone's entire species doesn't count as harming him?Not really everything is bad though. As said, the first third is actually pretty good. And there are a few hidden gems here and there. The remade version of the chalkboard scene (a cameo for John Cleese) was actually genuinely touching. A few other redeeming points are the pretty decent acting & characters, the good visual effects and the more spectacular action scenes (like swarms of microscopic killer bugs devouring an entire stadium in seconds). These almost make the film worth watching. Almost. Overall though, I can't bring myself to think of this movie as a proper heir to the original. It is all the more disappointing because the opening looked so promising. At the end of the day, it's just not a very good movie and not even worth it as just another sci-fi effects film.

I regret that I chose this movie, and there isn't much to say about it.I'm not big on the whole cliché unknown-species-crashes-on-earth-so-shoot-at-it-with-big-missiles saga, but I thought this movie looked entertaining. I do like good sci-fi movies with mysterious apocalyptic plots, and the IDEA of this movie is decent, but it never reaches its full potential. It always seemed to stay in that ""1951 regime"". Just way to simple for 2008, IMHO.The reason I give it a 5 is because it had enough action and loud noises to keep me awake, but it was still rather boring. I wouldn't say it's the worst movie I've seen this year, because the acting was good enough to keep my attention.Overall, if you simply MUST see this movie, wait till it comes out on DVD. It just isn't worth the money. If you want a bad attempt at a sci-fi action movie to shake your head down at thinking ""they could have done better"", go see it, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone expecting greatness.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
457,renata77,Hollywood's Gore Fest - Part Deux,5,12 December 2009,"I won't belabor the fact this movie can't hold a candle to the original, except that the special effects are up to date and the best the film has to offer. Yes, the always flat-affected Keanu is in his element. He was made for this movie.The plot is arresting in the beginning, the special effects riveting. No one knows why the aliens have come. At long last, from which point everything begins to unravel, Klaatu the alien, who's emerged from a glassy sphere, cryptically tells the hapless humans they are destined to be annihilated because they ""can't be reasoned with."" About what? By whom? As in the original, the response to his arrival with firepower appears to explain the motivation of the aliens, but since that happened *after* his arrival, that cannot be the entire explanation.No, the problem is our planet is one of few which can support life and we can't be allowed to imperil it. So the aliens will not have dialogue with us, nor try to help or teach us - they will merely expediently destroy us, and everything else in sight, instead. Except, presumably, not the plants or animals, but that's unclear, except for those animals placed in spherical ""arks"" to be whisked away.From here, we are treated to an incoherent Gore-ish dream come true, wherein every edifice built by man, from signs to buildings, are destined to be consumed by the robotic equivalent of a plague of locusts. It's not enough to get rid of mankind alone, but even his very imprint on the land must go.The earth, we learn, is obviously not meant for the habitation of man, but is rather far more important than mankind or his inconvenient needs for shelter, heat and sustenance.Interestingly enough, the seemingly all-knowing Klaatu and his ilk have not even realized there is more than one side to mankind until it is all but too late. Horrors! Condemning mankind without sufficient observation is a reasonable course of action for a ""superior"" race?Along the way, while vilifying man for having need of vehicles and buildings, Klaatu, not unlike Gore, is not above making use of man's vehicles himself. Somehow, although he can kill and raise from the dead using power from a non-running automobile, he cannot propel himself from here to there without the use of evil polluting mechanical conveyances. For shame! But, never fear, he wakes up to the error of his presumptions about humans before everything on earth is consumed by his nanobots. Having rescued man from his wrath, he is content to depart earth with his arks of rescued animals - for a price. All the lights go out in what buildings are left, all the oil drills and vehicles cease to function, and even watches no longer work. Glorious deliverance! All is well - the sun is shining, the birds are singing! Mankind but has to go back to living in caves without machinery, light, heat or appliances and heaven on earth will have been realized. The deus-ex-machina has banished all the machines we were too short-sighted to eliminate ourselves. Gore's in his heaven and all's right with the world. Isn't life wonderful?Well, maybe it would be worth it to live in a world without alarm clocks.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
458,schristian-6,The Day the Earth Stood Still review,6,12 December 2008,"First let me say that I'm NOT a fan of Keanu Reeves. 2nd let me say that I HATE when liberal Hollywood preaches their morals and beliefs on the rest of the world. 3rd, I've never seen the original The Day The Earth Stood Still. Sad, I know, just never had a chance to see it. Saw the movie in beautiful IMAX last night which was good and bad. Good because the movie looked and sounded amazing. Bad because Keanu Reeves was 3 stories tall. However he was perfect in some ways. Wooden, emotionless, and monotone. The movie was Okay, not great, not horrible. But what was really just liberal agenda thinly disguised as entertainment. With the thousands of Hollywood stars that would have done this movie for free, the best they could come up with was Keanu? They could have found someone who can actually ACT. Al Gore should have played the part that Keanu plays. Will Smith even got his kid a part in the movie. (Another problem I have with Hollywood). Of all the talented kid stars, they cast Jaden Smith. To his credit he does have ONE scene that I didn't want to pull his dreads out one by one. (I also can't stand kids with smart mouths and no respect for their parents/guardians) Jennifer Connelly was good and beautiful as she always is. (although in my opinion, she needs to eat a sandwich. She's lost all of her ""baby fat"" and 90% of her curves which is what drew her to my attention in the first place years ago). Kathy Bates is even sub par in this. She plays the obligatory role of the ""big bad government."" And of course the military is portrayed as the bumbling kill happy thugs that Hollywood thinks they are. Who's it for?

461,dubya13,extremely misunderstood,7,14 December 2008,"I'd have given it 7.5 if I could.I had never seen the original, so I decided to watch both back to back. I think I've realized the chief problem most people have with the new version: it's not a remake. From the beginning, it's painfully obvious that the 2008 TDTESS isn't meant to emulate the 1951 original. Instead, it is an embellished translation.In 1951, the Cold War, atomic warfare, imperialism, and global politics were high on the list of ""problems in this world"". The entire movie is a transparent commentary on violence, war, and as Klaatu put it, ""stupidity"". While these general ideas remain constant today, other issues are at hand. Global Warming (or, translating into less politically charged terms, ""human wastefulness"") is beginning to have obvious consequences. To make TDTESSv2.0 have similar impact to the original, many of the themes must be changed. It makes sense that there would be ""arks"" of sorts, that Klaatu wouldn't have understood love and humanity (and thus his exposure to it would change his mind), and even that there would have been scouts sent ahead to gather useful information and genetic data.All that said, the execution of this potentially translatable idea wasn't perfect. Though some have complained about the McDonald's scene, I found it brilliant for the most part. Klaatu would have little or no knowledge about what kind of place it was, so it would be equally appropriate to have such a conversation as anywhere else. The switch to English for more...philosophical points irked me though, it would make more sense for them to switch to their native tongue (do they have tongues?). GORT's...dissolving and subsequent disappearance leave more questions than anything. Also, while the sonic attack he used early on made sense to me, I think that the utter disappearance of weaponry from the original would have been far more affective (as opposed to basic Hollywood explosions). Other bits of discontinuity are mentioned throughout these reviews, so I won't need to get too detailed myself. My main complaint is that Klaatu never actually warned any group of people...how are we supposed to get the message that he was sent to give?Some execution was handled very well. The plague of old sci-fi is that ""aliens"" tend to look awfully familiar. Most are humanoid, and Klaatu was pretty much human entirely. TDTESSv2.0 did a very good job eliminating these barriers. The placental mass and subsequent ""birth"" of Klaatu explain both the strange ""salve"" from the original and his resemblance to us. The ship no longer looks like it could ever have come from anything we built, unlike v1.0, which looks buildable (if not functional) through many means available in the 50's. The unexplained uniqueness of otherworldly diamonds is completely done away with, as is the suspicious boyfriend. I'd like to have seen more epiphanies like the one about Abraham Lincoln, but to fit them into the context of the new one may have ruined it.While a horrible remake, the 2008 version of ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" is a pretty good *translation* of the 1951 sci-fi classic. I'd recommend it to anyone, whether or not they've seen the original. Actually, I'd recommend both.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
462,soodynem,An effects laden re-imagining of the 1951 classic.,7,12 December 2008,"It has been over a year since I've seen the original. I picked it up at a library while in exile in the woods Washington. And I liked it. I liked it as much as you can like a 1950's movie with a cheesy robot that shoots lasers, and an alien who looks and talks just like a human. It's a classic movie with a classic message. This movie is a suitable re-imagining of it. When I first saw the trailers, I'll admit I had mixed feelings. Sure, aliens, special effects, Gort, special effects, spheres of death, special effects, special effects, and John Cleese. But, uhYeah. I really don't buy into this whole 'global warming' thing that is such a popular money-maker right now. But really, there is no other way to remake this movie without throwing that in, especially now that the threat of nuclear war is so much less than what it was in the 1950's.I walked out of the theater finding myself enjoying this production far more than I thought I would. Keanu Reeves just can't seem to shake the Jesus role, and here, he's perfect. Klaatu is a cold, emotionless, robotic type who only loves the green earth that humanity is destroying. As he once stated, Keanu is portraying an inversed Klaatu. The original one was very human-like at the beginning, but then gave his speech about the threat humanity faces if they continued their violence. Here, he is an unloving being who slowly develops compassion toward his human companions.Jennifer Connelly is good as Helen, the astro-biologist and step-mother to Jacob, played by Jaden Smith. Jaden is a talented young actor, and he's fun to watch most of the time. The few short scenes where it's just him and Keanu are very, very good. Kathy Bates plays Regina Jackson, the United States Secretary of Defense, and her role was somewhat larger than I thought it would be. I was surprised at the relatively short amount of screen time that John Cleese got, which consisted of a short scene in which he pleads with Klaatu to spare the earth. I like John Cleese. This movie would have gotten one more star if he had had a bigger role.Ah, the special effects. Would it really be possible to remake an older movie these days without 'em? 28-foot tall Gort looked amazing. His destructive capabilities which resemble a swarm of insects are a very cool effect. The space ships were a fresh re-imagining of the dated flying saucer that I'm sure the non-inclusion of such will enrage many fan-boys out there. This movie doesn't disappoint in the technical aspects.Surprisingly, I found myself at times agreeing with the sentiments in the film. It didn't focus mainly on global warming (although the shots of a smoke-shooting factory and pumpjacks shutting down were non-too-subtle) but on the inherent sinful, violent, and destructive nature of man. However, how the aliens chose to deal with this is a little drastic. What's the point of keeping complex-life sustaining planet alive if the only intelligent species on it is dead?

The movie is very noisy and difficult to listen to. The special effects are of very poor quality. The plot sounded promising at the beginning with an alien coming to warn the human race that they will be exterminated if they do not change their attitude of spoiling their planet. But it falls short and then all resulting actions are related to serious inconsistencies. The US army holds an alien against his will and does not tell any other powers like France, Russia, UK, Canada, etc. What a pity ! The plot reveals a general attitude among US people which is a disgrace : that sense of superiority and lack of respect of the others. I hope that this is not how the soldiers are trained to react to an encounter of the third kind. I hope that soldiers will never have control of such events. Why is it that the ET lands in New York again ? They could have selected Geneva. Among inconsistencies, here are just a few. The contact (Keanu Reeves) has incredible powers but cannot even communicate with his spaceship. Why did he not fulfil his mission of giving his speech to the United Nation ? Why did the ETs commenced humanity destruction before they get an official response from them ? Why is the US army acting so stupidly by attacking first when the main spaceship does not pose a threat ? The final is horribly stupid since the ETs are going to leave without asking mankind to evolve. This movie is like the ETs in it : no sense of purpose. How low can you go ?

The movie just felt like nothing it was like there was scenes people were saying stuff and things were happening but it did not gel and felt like it was just there it really did feel like it was standing still ( pun intended ).But the movie wasn't terrible it was your average cgi based sci fi thriller and it would have been watchable for me if little jaden but hole smith wasn't there being all smug because his dads a rapper actor.

If Smith and Connelly's love is enough to convince Klaatu to spare the human race, then he obviously was not paying attention when (insert notable act of selfless altruism here).

Jumping from scene location to scene location, I almost felt like I wanted to go back and see what happens next in the other scene.Summary then is as follows. If you really are a special effects lover then maybe this will attract you, mainly for explosions and not much else, they were pretty basic. If you are a sci-fi fan, it will more likely attract you, but even then there wasn't much to it. Yes Gort looked cool but it felt like he did less this time round.

There is no connection between the new and the old movie. If you plan on making a remake, you need original context to make it work. Well, there was none and consequently it failed.First of all, Gort, disappointing. The only word that sums up his performance. It was shocking. In the old version, Gort is seen a lot more than in this film. In this film, Gort is merely shown as Klaatu's protector. No one refers to him, nothing is said or explained about him. The only time Gort comes alive is when he transforms into tiny nanites. My first thought of Gort was profoundly awesome, when Klaatu explains in the original the extent of Gort's powers and the potential destruction he could cause. But this film undermines Gort, in many ways. To Scott Derrickson, Gort's lack of screen time is extremely disappointing.As for the actors, Keanu Reeves was mediocre as Klaatu. Michael Rennie did a better job in the original. Jennifer Connelly, throughout the whole movie, does nothing but try to convince Klaatu to save the Earth. Again, the character was undermined. Jaden Smith, not suited for this movie. I don't know why but I'm just not feeling the love here.

475,dante_feditech,Klaatu barada nikto / otkin adarab utaalk,1,31 December 2008,"I remember reading somewhere that ""Klaatu barada nikto"" meant ""Harm them not, for they know not what they do."" I'm not sure it's true, but I like that meaning, and find it appropriate - because this film takes the polar opposite view. In this film it is more a case of, ""They know exactly what they're doing, but are sticking their fingers in their ears and humming rather than admitting it or trying to fix it - so kill them all."" In this film humans aren't excused for being children, they're put on trial, as adults.That we're destabilising global temperatures isn't the problem. That we're doing nothing about it isn't the problem. It's the fact that it was proved for about ten years and that the majority chose to not believe it in spite of all evidence until about two years ago.And quite frankly, good. Idiots who deliberately chose to reality (such as ignore major problems on the horizon - like global warming) and encourage others to do so, are just a big a threat to our world as nuclear weapons were when the first film was made. That is a good idea, an IMPORTANT idea. It's just a pity the producers were too cowardly to follow through on it. So why couldn't they say this? It's a classic case of telling rather than showing. Giving humans cheap clean fusion (for example) might help fix the environment, but it won't fix the insane delusions that too many humans are dumb enough to believe. For example, the insane delusion that the world is 6000 years old. Or the insane delusion that some people still have that global warming isn't real. Nothing the aliens can do or say or give away can fix that. So why couldn't Klaatu say this?Another horrid example (amongst many) of this 'tell don't show' is when Klaatu's ship approaches Earth. His ships is moving as 3 times 10 to the power of 7 meters per second you say? 1/10th the speed of light you say? That might damage New York you say? NO you IDIOT. That's won't slightly damage Manhattan, that will make Earth look like an apple after a horse has bitten it in half.

Weak story line, poor acting (unfortuantely almost hand in hand with Keanu) and poor cast (the kid in the film I can assure you will confirm this for you).Don't let this film paralyze you with boredom and terribleness like it says in the title.Avoid at all costs.I repeat...Avoid at all costs...over.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

480,agardk,"In the age of the remake, a example of how NOT to do it! Just AWFUL!",1,13 December 2008,"I'm a big fan of SciFi and as with many who love the genre, I considered the 1951 version a classic. So, I was quite anxious to see the remake. The obvious change in the primary point of the plot, (war/violence to environment/climate) seemed workable, and if properly executed, had potential.As it turns out, it was potential unfulfilled. I left the theater thinking that was 2 hours of my life that I'd never get back.Mediocre acting can sometimes be overcome by a really good story and script but no amount of great acting or special effects, which this film definitely did not contain, can overcome a lousy script. SPOILERS FOLLOW In the original the scenes of the Earth standing still occurred at a point in the story line that made sense in the flow of the story. The point was to demonstrate that the aliens did indeed have the ability to destroy the earth. In this version they choose to plug that event in at the end of the movie leaving viewers wondering why. The change in the plot from advanced races sending a being to evaluate and warn us to changes our ways to one in which the decision to destroy humanity has already been made guts the point of the original story and makes this noting more than another ""B"" aliens come to destroy the Earth movie. Finally, the acting in this bomb leaves much to be desired. Keanu Reeves was emotionless, as usual. Jennifer Connelly was almost as bad. Perhaps the most disappointing was Kathy Bates, who is usually a great actor, although I do not know that anyone could really do all that much with the flotsam of a script they were saddled with. Bottom line is that this film is definitely not worth the cost or time and effort of a trip to the theater. If you must see it, do yourself a favor and wait for it to make it to the movie channels or show up in Red Box.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

482,swestley,Why so many negative reviews!??,7,1 February 2010,"I consider myself a demanding viewer, and to be honest, I rented the Blu-ray to the updated Day the Earth Stood Still because it included the original in HD as well; but damned if I wasn't quite impressed with this re-imagining of the original. Most of you reading probably know the 1951 film inside and out, and this story is fundamentally loyal to it. However, the new version offers a modernized slant- since the original story probably wouldn't work today- and I found much of it to be very compelling. Some of the special effects, and the technological ideas, are real welcome standouts, and made up for 'bright light' spaceships, which have never really flown for me. (pun not intended, but I'll take credit for it) The choice of Keanu Reeves in the role of Klaatu is ideal, with the interrogation and train station scenes being real standouts. And what can one say about Jennifer Connelly, not one false note. Little Jaden Smith rocks too. And then there's Gort. While I believe more could have been done with this imposing monster of a robot, and pound for pound, he doesn't stand up to the menace of the original, he's still pretty darn bad-ass. The ending seemed rather abrupt, but overall, I found this to be a solid rental.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

I was expecting something quite good judging by the trailer I saw a while ago coupled with the fact that I have a soft spot for this directors first film ""Hellraiser Inferno"". Instead I go an Incoveniant Truth all over again but with Al GORT!!!! I mean come on the kid in this film is perhaps the most annoying person I have bore witness to in a movie EVER! So much so that I just wanted the equally annoying Jennifer Connolly to give the brat a clip round the ear. I was actually hoping the annoying Alien played by the annoying Keanu would throw the kid into one of the annoying orbs (that don't actually do very much), or better still Pinhead from the aforementioned Hellraiser film would appear with his Rusty fish hooks on chains and damn the little tyke to an infinity in Hell for making me so annoyed.

484,im_goode,A '08 remake manages to be more boring than the '51 original.,4,13 October 2010,"I wanted to like this movie, but at no point in time did I trick myself into thinking that this would be as good or even nearly as good as the original. At the very least, I thought, people who have never seen the original would get to enjoy the story with some flashy graphics and it will bring attention to a classic sci-fi movie. I was wrong. This movie is just plain boring. Whether you're a fan of the original or someone new that thought this looked interesting, I can't imagine you enjoying this.My first complaint is that the pacing is so very slow. You spend most of the movie listening to monotone conversations or watching Keanu Reeves stare at things intently. The movie only has one tone, and that's DEAD SERIOUS. There's no light hearted moments to contrast the graveness of the situation like the original. All the actors give the same grim-dark unwavering performance, which results in you not caring for anyone in the movie or the situation as a whole.At least the CG is entertaining, right? No, not really. There's lots of bright lights and bloom effects, but for the most part it's poorly done and blatantly obvious. However I must admit, I thought the idea of an ever growing swarm of destructive nanobots was interesting, and I enjoyed watching them wreak havoc on everything in their path.The plot was pretty weak and shallow. It's worth mention that this is based on a 50s sci-fi movie (an era where most sci-fi movies were ""Devil Girl from Mars"" or ""Attack of the Killer Ant"") and managed to make the plot less believable and ridden with more plot holes. The motives for most of the characters are far fetched at best, and downright silly at worst.All things considered, there's really no reason to watch this movie. I can't think of a single person who would like this better than the original. Even if I completely ignore the fact that it's a remake, this is still a weak movie on it's own legs. Unbelievable, unlikable characters and monotone performances are just some of the low points in this otherwise mediocre and boring movie. 4/10",The Day the Earth Stood Still
485,Voytek_Pavlik,"I've seen the remake 2 days ago, and today I've watched the old one from the 50's.",2,18 December 2008,"""Helen Benson: What were you, before you were human? Klaatu: It would only frighten you""And that quote missed the point of the original's message.IMO, the original movie had a message, while the remake missed it all. Yes, it still keeps the people's stupidity (which still exists in reality), but in this remake, they decided (for some reason) to change ""placing nuclear missiles in the space"", into a ""global warming and destroying the planet with our greedy existence"". Oh yeah, that's right, we already have nuclear missiles around our planet, so it's not a bad thing anymore!? Let's place it with global warming. In the next 50 years global warming will be ""ok"" so we will do another remake of this movie, but changing global warming into a...overused breathable air!Don't be ridiculous, this movie was not about saving the Earth from our stupidity, but saving ""ourselves"" (the human race) from our stupidity. And I think that was the reason it was told in 50's, because manly...it was not far after the first atomic bomb was used (Hiroshima in 1945) and the first mass UFO encounters (aka. flying saucers). It was a message that someone fits even today.So let's take a look on the cast that is mostly interested me- KlaatuKlaatu with Keanu looks and sound like a robot or a monster hidden inside of a human body, while Klaatu in the old ones (by Michael Rennie) was a human just like us. And that was the point of, it made a mystery about who they were, because they might be as us- humans. The director went the easy way, explained that Klaatu is a some sort of beast inside a human body (the quote above), and that we would be scared of it. Although, Keanu is a good actor for this movie, but the role he is playing was dumped down. Klaatu was a smart, peaceful and friendly guy. Klaatu in this remake is a soulless psychopath with stupid x-men-like powers.Seriously, why the hell did they give him special powers like bringing people from the dead? Why? The machine that brought Klaatu from the dead in the original movie was more logical and intelligent than this, unintelligent and stupid crap. And I also don't like how they linked the theory of evolution in the movie. I'm not a creationist, or evolutionist, or scientologist, I just think things are still not well explained yet, and the original movie wasn't linked to neither evolution nor creationism.The only things I liked were: 1. micro, nano robots that were able to eat us all (good idea for a quick, mass destruction) 2. reference to the religion, with those ""arks"" (although, the idea of ""saving the planet"" is stupid right from the bottom) 3. Special FX (which is a normal thing in todays Hollywood movies)After seeing this, I gave it 7/10, but after seeing the old one, I'm giving it 3/10, because Mr Derrickson missed the point of the movie. He made another ""Oh noz! Alienz want to destroy us again!!"" cartoon.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

I hate it when directors rely on CGI and limit dialogue. The CHANGE that people go through when faced with ultimate disaster does not happen as suddenly as it did repeatedly in this movie. From the first shot through the entire movie all transitional indicators were missing. You didn't feel the apprehension that led to that initial shot. You didn't witness the turmoil of the boy as realization of his error in judgment set in.I hope that these scenes were shot and simply did not survive the editing.

Unfortunately, the various key problems prompting Klaatu's arrival aren't actually mentioned. The enlightenment - that could have come in response to the displayed desire to kill something that isn't understood - was barely touched on. The hero doesn't leave a powerful statement to the world before departing, as the original film's hero did.

Had this film been an updated re-telling of the original story it would have stood a chance. As it was, other than sharing the names Klaatu and Gort (and in the latter case, only barely), and a vaguely similar story line, this film bears little in common with the original ""The Day The Earth Stood Still.""

This is not to say it is boring, but there is no sense of ""what is going to happen next""-ness. Derrickson structures the film well and his direction is admirable, and whilst the film jumps quickly into the action it never really lets loose, but keeps at a constant level of ""oh"" instead of ""wow"". Reeves is forgettable, Connelly is not bad, but one feels that she could have delivered all her lines to a wall and the same effect would remain. Jaden Smith is the most annoying addition ever. It seems that all the characters were implemented into the storyline in order to further the plot and present the audience with a (rather feeble) message at the end. So, we never relate to any of them. The lack of character identification stands out as this film's major problem. The film lacks any kind of humour (besides the brief (much needed) John Cleese scene). It also ends all to hastily with a whimper instead of a bang.However, it is redeemed (partly) due to a few good scenes, which stand out as promise of what kind of suspense the film could have held (the polygraph test (seen in the trailer) and the few minutes afterwards are the best scenes in the film). There are many promising moments in the film, but it never fully realises them. Derrickson should up the ante next time.See it out of curiosity, but not for entertainment.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

But the same people have also come in telling me how rubbish Saw IV was, and promptly rented Saw V when it first came out! Overall, I watched the film, which, for me to not be distracted during is a miracle. But I didn't really remember much once it had finished. I remember something to do with Neo saving the annoying kid who I wished would have died, as that would have construed, to me, a happy ending. But the fact that Mr. Reeves has not played any other character since Bill and Ted aside, this film lacked the wow factor it could have had. I rated it a seven because, I think people should watch it, whether they have seen the original or not. But, ultimately, a 7 is a failure for a film of this budget, and of its kind. Sci Fi are some of the biggest grossing movies around and for this one to feel so...not dull but more, ordinary, is a shame.

498,MiddleOfNowhere,"Not terrible, but also not more than the sum of its parts",3,12 December 2008,"It seems that over the years, Keanu Reeves has developed quite a taste for big-budget SF movies with a generally positive message about humanity - and, just like his colleague Will Smith, with a more than healthy success at the box office.This time, The Excellent Dude is going for a remake of a classic SF movie from 1951, which again is based on a 1940 story (""Farewell to the Master"" - worth reading and available online). On board are John Cleese, Jennifer Connelly and more Special FX specialists than you can shake a mouse at.Unfortunately, in this case, the whole is not greater than its parts.Actually, the one aspect of the movie that still seems as plausible as in the 1951 version is the degree of fear and aggression that meets the Alien visitor - including, but not limited to a US Secretary of Defense that denies him to see the United Nations; a less-than-subtle hint at the current state of world politics.There is some promise in the second act, when various parties try to get access to Klatu, but beyond a certain point, the plot and the emotional/dramatic turning points are predictable. The same story could have been told very effectively in a 30 minute Outer Limits episode - but then, a lot of people would have earned less money.Speaking of money: the concept of how *different* Alien technology could be and the special effects derived from it have potential, but it is never fully realized. I.e., the spheres are often shown without any visual context allowing us to estimate their size. The same goes for the robot. On the other hand, it's not this movie's fault that we have been spoon-fed breathtaking CGI for a decade and now simply sit here with synapses that can't take much more.I also believe that there probably was a bet if someone could play the main character of a big budget movie with fewer facial expressions than Arnold Schwarzenegger in the original ""Terminator"". If so, Keanu Reeves has clearly won. And while I'd like to believe that this is simply a terrible weight this particular role put on him, I'll go with the ""Matrix 4ever"" theory of a guy who has finally found the facial expression that will earn him the most money.Now I am slightly surprised seeing my hands write what most come across as a very cynical look at what is basically a big-budget show with a message of hope. Why? I went into this movie expecting a decent mainstream SF movie, but the fact that I am rather disappointed now may be due to the fact that it tried to be more - just *very* half-heartedly.And although I agree with the movie's core message about the harm we are doing to the planet we live on, led by greed, fear and stupidity, it didn't touch me emotionally. It was like two puppets on sticks (the other one being a seemingly bored Jennifer Connelly) reciting Romeo and Juliet. It's not impossible to make such a thing fly - it just takes more talent than we saw here.For now, I believe John Carpenter's ""Starman"" still is the most touching, wonderful movie about human life as seen from a higher perspective. Rent it when you have the time. The effects are what you can expect from a 1984, medium-budget John Carpenter production. But is has heart and soul, great dialog and, last but not least - The Really Excellent Dude in one of his most-overlooked roles.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Klatuu's people in this one think our planet is a precious resource we don't ""deserve"" and are here to pass judgement on us -- now -- with no real attempt to avoid it. Not only is this presumptuous, it's hypocritical given that according to Klatuu, his people only reformed when they had their own cataclysm.

This movie is full of self contradictory mistakes.. anyways...If not buy the DVD and smash it over the wall.,The Day the Earth Stood Still
508,greebosw,Pitiful attempt at a remake,3,14 December 2008,"I have to admit, i have a very poor record in picking good films. Almost every film i think will be good turns out to be a complete lemon, and, since i'd been looking forward to seeing this film ever since i saw the first trailer you can pretty much guess what is coming up next....This film is pitiful.The original film was a joy to watch. In fact, i dug it out last week and watched it again just so i would be able to compare the films, and i was glued to my seat the whole way though.Unfortunately i can't say the same for the remake.The opening starts off with an interesting twist on the origins of Klatu, but still feels pretty weak, and then moves into the present day where we find out an object is about to strike the earth at a colossal speed. Quite why this required the rounding up of all the top scientists to be flown to the impact site *before* the object that is expected to reduce everything to dust actually hits was never explained, and it set the scene for the first in a long line of weak, disjointed, and poorly thought out plot lines.Reeves as Klatu has none of the warmth of the original character. Maybe this was deliberate, or, as i suspect, it's because Reeves can't act. Either way, it resulted in a character that was impossible to identify with, and left me not caring at all if he lived or died.I was also very disappointed in the child's character. The original is full of wonder and awe for the world, whereas this child is a whimpering brat who doesn't really bring anything new to the film.On the plus side i did like the robot GORT, although again, the plot let this character down, and having the American Military creating the name for him was ridiculous, as were the silicon based locusts that devour everything.All in all very disappointing. Another tribute to Hollywoods love of special effects over substance.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
509,follow_my_ruin,The Day Good Sci Fi Stood Still,4,18 December 2008,"Probably to go down as one of the weakest reinterpretations of a classic sci-fi film ever. Even with two great actresses (Jennifer Connelly and Kathy Bates) a well known decent actor (Keanu Reeves), and a whole slew of 'we-should-have-seen-more' effects the movie can not escape it's mediocre at best writing and it's poor editing. It is a riveting concept, with engaging characters and alien presence but it just falls short and gets kind of jumbled and rushed in the end. As if all of those aspects weren't enough you have annoying little Jayden Smith's character along the whole time.

Jennifer Connelly was also brilliant, but both were saddled with a lame plot line. Even the original had more suspense and depth than this remake. I thought the movie started out well and kept my interest until we get to the part where he has an immediate revelation and changes his ""destroy the humans to save the earth"" mindset to ""they have a good side...so they are worth saving"" change of heart just by watching Jennifer hug her step son in the cemetery. Geesh, if we would have known it was that easy, she would have done that right at the beginning of the movie and saved us two hours of agony. And the ending was extremely disappointing. It's like they got tired of making the movie and just ended it. My daughter came up with better endings for the movie on our ride back home after wards. The special effects were stimulating and convincing. But it seems like it was just a waste of time, money and energy for such a lame plot. Sorry to see such great actors in such a poor movie.

512,justingx2,Bad story compared to the original,4,23 June 2014,"My big problem with this version of the movie is that the entire story has been altered. The original alien came to Earth to warn Humans that their aggression would not be tolerated by a group, a federation, of other aliens and that any such move would leave the Earth a burning cinder.This remake changed that storyline into one where the Aliens (no longer a federation? Not sure?) are concerned with the planet itself and the harm we're doing to it and if we do not stop we will be exterminated so that the planet can survive.So what happens? They start destroying every man-made thing on the planet because, well, why not? We were going to do it anyways, right? Might as well start now! But, the Alien sees emotion in humanity and decides that humanity must live. What? He said they had been observing humanity, they didn't notice this before? And, even then, any alien (hell even a normal person) would understand that it is precisely because Humans are prone to deep emotions is the very reason why we act so irrationally in the first place.Bad movie.I must say however that whoever was responsible for the GORT did awesome work, he's the best part of the entire movie and completely CGI.4 out of ten... they should have not strayed so far from the original story and replaced it with a really terrible one.-EDIT- -- I agree with many reviewers that this movie did not need a remake, it needed a sequel.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

This was a very entertaining movie, that was well balanced in it's use of action, dialog, music and drama. I had no expectations and was pleasantly surprised. The special effects are wonderful and not overplayed. The editing is not this fast style pop video nonsense, that leaves you feeling sick. On the contrary you can actually SEE what is happening.

I've not seen the original and have never read the book, which maybe why I enjoyed the movie.If you've never read the book and providing you're not a huge fan of the original, you'll probably like this movie. It's not ground-breaking and it's not going to go down in the annals of cinema as one of the all-time greatest Sci-Fi movies, but it's a lot better than some of the dross I've watched lately and an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

The Title.When you remake ANY movie classic, you have people drawing negative comparisons.This movie would have been much better received had it not been compared to the original.I would challenge critics of this film to go back and take a fresh view of the original. It is full of nonsense that at the time was acceptable.Overall, the story line, acting, effects (obviously) and feel of this movie is better than the original (if you don't compare them as the same film).Spoilers: I never read the original story, but I am guessing the remake is probably closer to it than the 51 version.The idea that Klaatu is here to save the earth at the cost of humans is great. The 1951 version was geared more to cold war anti communism.The flaws in the remake lie primarily in the GORT character (?). What was the purpose of the form of GORT, prior to destroying everything ? I know that in the original story you find out that GORT was in fact The Master. In the film, it is just a weapon.Also, the way the film was left hanging.It seems like it was missing maybe 5-10 minutes, to go into more detail on the 'price the earth had to pay'. Again, if you are looking for a remake of the 51 film, you will be disappointed.However, if you watch this as an unrelated movie, you will enjoy it.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
516,avwilson-2,earth got a two hour long commercial for hybrids and cappuccinos,3,7 August 2009,"This movie is a shining beacon of product placement. It is a movie that has been specifically scripted to sell products to a distinct demographic.It's a sci-fi special effects blockbuster that I'm actually glad I missed in the theaters, the special effects are that unimpressive. GORT is so poorly done that he reminds me of the figurine dinosaurs from the original land of the lost series.Get this, the movie is a script that is a re-write of a script that is a re-write of a movie from the 1950's. Okay, so you take a sci-fi movie that was a commentary on the violence of World War 2 and the atomic bomb, and rewrite it so that it appeals strictly to hyper liberal upper class wanna be environmentalists and then fill it with product placement that will appeal to this demographic. I.E. hybrid cars and cappuccinos.We're talking about a movie that uses a hybrid car for its car chase scenes. We're talking about a movie that has a meeting of aliens in a McDonalds just so they can splash a ten foot tall McCafe across the screen.So in this movie, an alien race comes to earth with the intention of wiping out human life because humans are destroying the earth. Guess who changes the alien's mind, or at least plays an integral role in doing so? The retired ivy league professor who lives in a half million (at least) dollar lake side house complete with acres of forest property and a beautifully finished real wood full room library.

517,Spineshivers,I'll give it a five and a half,5,3 January 2013,"It's a good film if you want to relax and not watch anything too demanding on your brain. I know I feel that need sometimes. The movie has its up and downs. The storyline is entertaining to watch and the premise of the plot is good though not original.There are also negative parts and unfortunately there are a lot of them. While the storyline IS entertaining like I said before, you cannot omit the severe holes in it. There are many stereotypes in the dialogue and the worst one comes from the alien's utter ignorance to be frank. I for one am a big Sci Fi buff, hence I have a great deal of imagination. I cannot imagine a society of aliens that reached that kind of technological evolution and still think that things are just black and white. It only takes the arguments of a mere human, a Nobel prize winner, to change his mind. The plot dumbs down the alien and humans alike. You don't have to win a Nobel prize to come up with those simple and logical arguments which convinces Klaatu to not kill us. I can't believe that a civilization or a group of ones as stated in the movie that had a path similar to ours before evolving wouldn't be more sympathetic. The alien is portrayed as quite ignorant and shallow.I would also want to comment on some of the characters.I didn't like Keanu Reeves. I always thought he wasn't very good and the script of the movie didn't help at all.I'd like to comment on the child's role too. I've seen that many have portrayed him as obnoxious. Well he is. Very! But I think that the character is intentionally done that way. He illustrates all that's wrong with humanity. Granted, I'm not saying they didn't severely over did it.As for the rest of the actors... well, aside from the Nobel prize winner and the woman which were the only normal people, the rest of the humans remind me of the movie Idiocracy. It was funny in a way. I only felt bad for Kyle Chandler. He is a decent actor and can be a lovable character. I loved him in the TV show ""Early Edition"". Now he portrayed a blunt Neanderthal. Kind of spoiled my childhood memories of the TV series I previously mentioned.It's an entertaining flick, but not more. I'll give it a five cause it isn't unwatchable and I've seen way worse. I'll also admit I haven;t seen the original in order to do a proper review, but I'm not interested. Aside from the Star Trek: The Original Series, 2001: A Space Odyssey and a few others I don't care much for old Sci Fi movies or TV shows.

I actually didn't find any excitement in the script, the cgi, the acting, or even the opening or closing credits.

520,yesfan-1,A complete mess...,2,13 December 2008,"Rarely have I seen a big-budget movie that was as bland, predictable and shoddily put together as 'The Day the Earth Stood Still'. I have not seen the black-and-white original from the 50s, but in comparison to this remake it must be an utter thrill-ride.Almost every actor manages to embarrass him- or herself in this mess of a movie. Keanu Reeves is as wooden as Gort, the faceless robot at his side - but at least his character is supposed to be an emotionless alien - the rest of the cast has no such excuse. Jennifer Connelly, talented and beautiful as she is, is stuck in the same absent-minded, weepy-eyed rut she has been in for most of her recent performances. She is supposed to be the main active character of the story but ends up as a seemingly passive spectator. Bates is so robotic in the delivery of her lines you almost suspect her to be revealed as an android in the movie.The plot is riddled with holes big enough to fly a spaceship through them, the dialog is trivial, as are the emotions of the lead characters. All suspension of disbelief aside - I doubt a supremely advanced alien being will be convinced to overturn an important intergalactic plan thousands of years in the making after having a cup of tea with a nice old biologist (a miscast John Cleese) and witnessing a few tears from a mother and child.The direction borders on the incompetent, the sets are drab, grey and uninspiring and overall the movie has a sense of miniature scale when in fact it is advertised as a bombastic science fiction drama.Finally, the special effects are among the worst I have seen in a big-budget production to date. Utterly lifeless, regurgitated and decidedly non-frightening.Save your money and seek out some well-produced and more thought-provoking science fiction material instead of risking to be dumbed down by this tripe.A major disappointment.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

522,metallicacid,Woeful and infuriating,1,13 June 2012,"Before I begin this review I feel that I should mention that I have never seen the original. So I will judge this movie on its own merits.It is very rare that a movie will actually bring me to anger. But this insipid, preachy mess of a movie succeeded. In fact even as I write this review I can feel my fingers start to clench up in anger. This is a movie that makes my brain hurt. This is a movie that upon seeing it at the cinemas made want to run out onto the streets and scream obscenities while smearing the movie posters with my own feces.....err anyway on with the review.So it begins with the arrival of an alien by the name of Klaatu played by a cardboard cutout of Keanu Reeves and his pet robot by the name of Gort played by Woeful CGI (hmmn he's been in a lot of movies lately). I was immediately reminded of all those dictators you see on the evening news, you know like Saddam or Magabe. They usually had thugs enforcing there draconian laws too. Perhaps Klaatu is interested in politics. But no he has much bigger ideas. He is here making sure that we humans are behaving ourselves and living by his principles. And whether to leave us be or wipe us out. You know kind of like Hitler. Now this normally wouldn't bug me in a movie if he was the villain. But no the villain of this drek is humanity itself. We brought this on ourselves. And so Klaatu unleashes Gort onto the world after 7 hours of green idealism. So after mercilessly killing untold numbers of Innocent people. Klaatu is suddenly moved by the pleas of a woman who's named slips me right now played by Jennifer Connelly and lets the rest of us live but we were not allowed to have technology.This movie is like a dimwit trying to sound smart. The hypocrisy of killing a whole race of people because some are violent towards others is breathtaking. Yet this movie gets behind Klaatu as if he was the merciful one. This is extreme environmental Proganda. Which is Ironic when you consider that Klaatu's actions mirrors those of Goerge W Bush when he tried to enforce his ideology on Iraq.This is film making at its worst.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

The sad thing is that, given the talent and resources involved, it could have been great.The director completely misses what made the original such a wonderful film. Also, the plot points were necessary to drive the original story are either missing, or so muddied that they make no sense/undercut the underlying idea. (See, e.g., the final point below.)Instead, most of the creative energy was spent on special effects and CGI. These are impressive (in parts), but ""CGI does not a story make."" Robert Wise got more impact with a hubcap on a string for the spaceship, and a tall guy in a rubber suit for Gort.I cannot figure out why this film got such a good review (in the Los Angeles Times). It should have been panned. The same thing happened with the sequel to Hellboy: The second film spent much more on effects, and had none of the charm/imagination of the first.Final point: The ending -- in which all the Earth's machines/technology (cars, computers, trains, etc.) are instantly stopped by the aliens (to make a ""greener"" planet?) -- is completely against the ""Save Humanity"" message. Wiping out all technology in an instant means that 99% or so of the human race would die of starvation or disease (or societal collapse) within a couple of months.Gee, thanks for ""saving"" our planet, aliens.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Bottomline, somehow for me it ended up like an alternate version of Fantastic 4: Rise of The Silver Surfer.

The mediocre love showed by the doctor and that semi-annoying kid won't convince Silver Surfer, i mean, Klaatu, to stop the destruction.However, I honestly still enjoy the movie anyways. No matter how illogical this script seem to be, as a sci-fi and disaster movie fan, I was still entertained. Heck, I'll buy the DVD when it comes out. At least, it was quite a spectacle with all the eye candy. It's just entertainment. And somehow I liked this GORT better than the original Gort. This one is huge and really scary.

Would the Worldleader get the message ? and would they dismiss the stop of machine as some EMP side affect.The movie remind me of Jeff Bridges 's movie ""Starman"", an Earth woman and an alien running from the government.without the love relationship. Klaatu's change of heart was because he saw the other side of humanity.

Maybe,7,20 December 2008,"When i heard they were remaking The Day The Earth Stood Still I wasn't surprised, but i was a little sickened, especially by the casting on Reeves. But lets think about this, the message about the nuclear arms race to the audiences of the 50's was very relevant to that audience, just as much as global warming is to us. The way the film works was perfect for the fifties audiences, but it uses the same dramatic clichés that all the reviews here are moaning about. Sentimentality being the biggest complaint. In this new movie we can't relate to klatu, but why should we? He is an alien? I liked that. I liked that he could eat a tuna sandwich while someone has a heart attack. If we are to compare the original and the remake: then in 1951 klatu is there to warn us and ultimately threaten us into growing up and abandoning our nukes. In 2008 he is here to rid the earth of us, and why not? His argument works for me. OK, like i say, some of the dramatic techniques are clichéd, but when you are talking about the better and worse sides of our nature, certainly in terms of our effect on the planet, its going to get a bit sentimental. What other argument do we have? I think the film works. My one problem may be that what ultimately changes klatu's mind wasn't a good enough reason.

But I've decided to go anyway and I was right once more to not listen to the critics. The movie was really good. For all of you, who have many complaints about this movie and for all of you yet to see it, let me clear out some doubts for you. Compare this movie with one from 1951 its nonsense. You cannot even call it a remake, because the one in 1951 it's based on a cold war theory and the new one is dealing with our treatment with mother Earth. Choice of cast is more than good. Keanu is the best choice for the leading role. It's natural that his face is stoic all the time, because I can't imagine that a superior race would give a damn about us regarding how we treat the mother Earth. Also other actors done pretty good job. Maybe some scene could be a little longer with more conversation (especially one with the professor played by John Cleese) and a few others, but than a lot of you would probably complain that movie is too long. A lot of the best thing in this movie is in the details that many of the so called critics have overlooked. For instant the scene in the M' restaurant with the alien who live among us for seventy years, or collecting all the species from earth that needs to be saved (not us of course).The design of GORT the robot was also very good (can't imagine an advanced robot looking like robots made today). Somebody mention in one of the critics that not even once a global warming is mentioned. Do not delude ourselves. There are far worse things that we do with Earth that just burning fossil fuels (pesticides, wiping out the rain forests, nuclear bomb testing and so on and so on). Only thing that bothers me is the end of the movie. I thing that just for once the earth should be wiped out of us humans, because we really don't deserve to survive because of the way how we treat the mother Earth and each other. We are the most destructive race. Regardless of the critics go and see this movie and pay attention to the details.

The story is slow moving and leaves the audience thinking ""What was the point of the movie?"".I wish I could spend more time writing these comments, but I would rather forget about this movie sooner rather than later.We left this movie believing the ONLY reason this was remade, was to cash in on the whole ""Eco Warrior"" way the world is going.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
534,mck-17,Very disappointing,1,16 December 2008,"I was very disappointed in this movie. I never saw the original but I love alien movies and this one seemed like it could be nice. While watching it, it kept feeling like this picture had potential, but alas nothing comes from it. First of all when we first see Gort and he stops all the vehicles and missiles he looks awesome and then later he becomes a cloud? WTF? Clouds aren't scary or exciting and for some reason the cloud seems to eat certain things quicker than others? Mainly the main characters. And then, the ending! Never before has a movie had such a anti climax for an ending. What happened? Nobody but the main characters know that they should change their ways. Not even Kathy Bates. Why would they? And then the kid's character is SO annoying! He needs a decent hiding!!",The Day the Earth Stood Still

536,nexusstudio,"Good, just NOT The Day the Earth Stood Still!",5,12 January 2009,"I agree with much of what has been said here about this film. I held off seeing it but I was curious. This film turns out to be good just not great. It also is NOT ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and has deviated so wildly from Robert Wise' original film that the movie has more in common with the old 1950's film ""The Cosmic Man"" (itself a quasi remake of Day) right down to the spherical spaceship and destructive menace, than the great old classic whose name it stole.It's unfortunate that Hollywood has 'remake fever' at the moment and just did their typical thing of using the title of a famous, great old movie to suck people into theaters for what is only an original story dressed up with gratuitous allusions to the original.The spherical fleet of ships is an element from the old 1940 ""Farewell to the Master"" short story that the original film was based on. But geez, could we just have a realistic shiny metal flying saucer in a modern sci-fi film for once? Spielberg did in the latest Indiana Jones, why not these film makers? Frankly I found the constant swirling light patterns to be annoying and distracting.Keanu Reeves is very good in this film but he is never allowed to show any emotion, a bad break for Reeves as he has always been considered a wooden actor and this role could have changed that image but instead it reinforces it. Still he is good in this film and the ideal choice. The original Klaatu is a combination of intellect, warmth and mystery but not here! Maybe Hollywood should hire some actual science fiction writers for a change instead of their usual script sources. Too many people writing sci-fi who are not well versed in the medium.The big problem with this film is what is wrong with all the Hollywood sci-fi for the last 20 years. There can be NO human beings from outer space at all 'cause evolution tells us so. Bull. This is what went wrong in the ""Fire In The Sky"" film from the early 90's. The fact in the original film that after removing Klatuu's spacesuit, the doctors find him to be completely human is integral to the plot! The film's message is that it IS possible for human beings to live in peace with one another and the universe. Klatuu's humanity is proof of that. To remove that message and replace it with the tiresome eco message which people are being inundated with almost daily is worse than dropping the ball on a remake of a great old classic as is the important anti-war message of the 1951 movie and the 1940 short story is was based on. I mean, we're STILL fighting wars since then aren't we?The music score by Tyler Bates is a good competent music score that sounds just like every other good competent music score. There was no innovation such as the great Bernard Herrmann achieved in the 1951 version. This music score's best moments come from the quieter underscore instead of the annoying pounding percussion which modern directors seem to demand of their film composers. Interestingly, Herrmann used very little percussion in his score opting instead for atmospheric chords and dissonance.There is something to like here and there in this film, however. The opening 20 minutes is occasionally almost riveting. The military sequences in the film are great and the effects are very good, though the robot was a tad cgi-ish. The scene with James Hong and Keanu in the McDonalds was good but is just way too short to actually go anywhere, as is the scene with John Cleese who was a good choice for the role he played.Jennifer Connally was very good in her role and saves the film a little by that but the ending was rushed and diluted and really at no point does one feel compassion for Klaatu or the human race for that matter. Her adopted son was like an unneeded character and was gratuitously black and cocky. She might have been better off as childless or barren in this version.And Klaatu leaves the power off AND his robot Gort behind in it's particle state at the end. Sheesh!",The Day the Earth Stood Still
537,salmanraza47,Don't expect anything and then... you might just like it.,4,14 December 2008,"The movie makes you re-realize the fact that people have multiple sides to their personalities. I consider it an overkill to put forth this thought with so much science fiction. In addition, one might expect the movie to talk about doomsday, throw some light on the the predictions made for 2012 Apocalypse.... but none of that is in the movie. I like the special effects...very neat. specially the idea of nano robots, and super powerful genetic robot that can decompose into a billion nano robots. In short... watch it if u have no expectations. In terms of the characters, you may not be impressed with any of them. The actors did not have a lot of room. Reeves could have added some touch to the character he played, but guess he was also confused about what this alien was actually as a person.

538,SkipKing,Did Kurt Loder even see EITHER versions of this movie?,6,13 December 2008,"Kurt Loder's review is terrible. Why? Because he obviously didn't see the original movie NOR THIS ONE! I won't go into details. Simply see both movies and you'll see what I mean. (No spoilers here.) Meanwhile, yes, Keanu is wooden, as usual. He CAN act, but he never gets a chance most of the time. I thought Connelly was fine, Hamm was wasted (sadly), Cleese was great RECREATING (yes, Kurt, his scene was in the original movie!) the role, the effects were fun, and the fact that the story did follow most of the original movie and wasn't bogged down by TONS of destruction scenes was nice. So overall I enjoyed the movie a lot.But I was in the minority. LIGHTEN UP, PEOPLE. I just wish they hadn't ruined the movie. It seemed obvious that ""the powers that be"" decided to hack it up vs the original vision. But that's the way most movies go these days. Oh, and on that point, WHY did they screw around with the soundtrack to add ""booming junk"" when you can hear an obvious Bernard Herrmann tribute within it? Sad.RIP Michael Rennie and Robert Wise.PS I'm joking when I say... ""What, no Dogstar song in the end credits?""",The Day the Earth Stood Still
539,tyger78,"You ad me, then you lost me",4,13 June 2012,"Like 'A Nightmare on Elm Street', 'Psycho' and 'The Omen' this is one of those remakes that irritated me on general principal. Why Hollywood feels the need to remake movies that were perfect in their original form is beyond me. Well, we all know it is because of a lack of interesting ideas, but I digress. The original version of this film is arguably the greatest science-fiction film ever made. If not the best, it is most certainly in the Top 10.Saying all that about halfway I found myself actually enjoying this one. It seemed quite different from the original, and I must admit I found myself liking some of the differences. For example, I liked the idea of an almost birth-like process in the development of Klaatu. I'm neither a Keanu Reeves fan nor a Keanu Reeves hater, but I liked his performances as Klaatu.The problem for me came when the whole leftist ""global warming"" agenda became the reason for Klaatu's mission. As a libertarian, I'm not a believer in the man-made global warming scam. Either way Klaatu's statement that if man lives the planet dies, if man dies the planet lives is rather absurd. Even if there is man-made global warming, it will kill humans, but the planet itself will recover as it always has throughout its existence. As George Carlin once said, ""The planet isn't going anywhere...we are!"" There are plenty of other things that will cause human extinction before global warming (superflu, asteroid, etc.), so the major plot point became absurd to me. Hence the rating.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
540,bnelson22,What a strange flick !,3,12 December 2009,This movie could have been great .. but lost its way at about 20 minutes into the film. As soon as I saw Kathy Bates cast as a hawkish Defense Sec. - I knew we were in trouble - then the kid .. The character really adds no value to the story except for maybe giving Klaatu one more reason to take out humanity. And poor (cartoonish CGI) Gort - seemed to be an after thought. All in all - this movie needed to be reined in - they tried too hard to be PC and missed out on being a good movie.Whats odd .. as much as this movie annoys me to the core of my being - I can't seem to stop watching it on cable .. kind of like seeing a bad accident on the side of the road.The original 1951 didn't need a remake - especially to push an agenda.,The Day the Earth Stood Still

Its a rather slowpaced story, and with War Of the Worlds in my mind I never felt the visual satisfaction as I did with that movie. The visuals just don't make up for the lack of story-depth. I kept waiting for it but nothing came. In the end the story was just too dubious to be entertaining. ------ spoiler below------OK, the earth is going to be cleansed of humans by an alien society that sends a single guy to earth (and of course Manhattan...) to see if we are treating our planet right. In the process he meets an old Chinese guy who is actually an alien that has been living here for a while who said we cant be saved and have to be destroyed (but he loves us!..). So OK he decides to kill all living things on earth, except for some samples of species(Noa's arks: they evidently don't understand the basics of genomes and the necessity of a broad genepool) so the earth can start over. But no, he is convinced by a totally non-convincing woman with an hysterical child not to complete his plans. And he comes from a group of alien civilizations beyond our comprehension? And why do they really care for our earth, and why really cant technology help us?

I don't think this completely ruins the original, as most remakes are prone to do, but yet I'd have to have seen the original to make a proper opinion. It was up-to-date and flash, with some spectacular CG, with some developments on characters (or so I've read) that made it more interesting, like having to win Klaatu over, instead of him automatically being on our side. I would say that Jacob is thoroughly unlikeable though.Certainly by no means a classic, but not as bad as other people are making out.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
543,amandalea-1,Interesting statement,6,3 November 2012,"I just watched the original release of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and found it extremely interesting and creative. Then I read about the remake of this film and decided to watch it.My first comment would be that it is not a re-make, the main premise is vaguely the same; the alien comes to earth to try to save. But save what? The earth or mankind? This is where the two films start to diverge, making the second one a ""vaguely based on the original one"".That said the Scott Derrickson film has the advantage of all the technology nowadays available to film makers and he uses it, moderately but properly.The main issue in this film is in concordance with the notion that it is the humankind responsible for the status of the planet and some solution has to be found for the deterioration of its quality. In that sense I think that the director and screenplay writer were quite courageous to name mankind as the focus of the problem. This is a concept not only difficult to discuss but even stating it may provoke stern comments from narrow mind people.Unfortunately the surrounding situations; the foster mother of a eternally inquisitive boy, the gathered group of scientists who only pose questions but do not help one bit to solve the situation, the appearance of a plague that can destroy whatever it touches (buildings and people), among other things demerits the story to the point of leaving the spectator with a sense of emptiness.In short, this film makes an interesting statement but do not solve it. Still it is worth seeing for the statement sake.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

545,al_baby_1024,"Flat characters, unimaginative writing",3,29 December 2008,"The kid, Jacob Benson, wants nothing more than to kill the aliens. Five minutes after he turns Klaatu in to the military, Klaatu saves him from ""the precipice"" as he's about to fall a few feet into water. In that instant, Jacob becomes Klaatu's best friend.A little later, at his father's grave, the kid cries for about 30 seconds with his stepmother. Up until then he had shown nothing but contempt for her, to her face and behind her back. After that, he calls her mom.Klaatu has been convinced by his spy that humans are not worth saving. He repeats several times how we don't deserve to continue as a species, yet when he sees this deep emotional outpouring at the cemetery he decides that humans are worth saving after all.There are more of these contrived, unbelievable character turnarounds ""at the precipice"".When they put the robot in a silo to examine it they already knew its eye was dangerous, but guess what was 10 feet in front of the control center windows? And why did GORT wait until after several unsuccessful attempts to examine/destroy him before beginning the sterilization of the planet? Klaatu had been saying for hours that the process had begun.Probably what bothers me the most is the incredible conceit Klaatu demonstrates. He decides that humans do not have the right to make mistakes on the planet they evolved on, but outsiders have the right to annihilate the native species based on their criteria. Does that mean the writers think that nation X has the right to destroy nation Y because X has decided that Y is being callous with its resources? I guess the message is ""Might Makes Right"".The original was a little better, Klaatu said that what we do to our own planet is our business. The other planets didn't step in until we had the potential to be a threat to them.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
546,gendreau_neil,Not deserving of the respect to warn about any spoilers,1,14 December 2008,"Warning - Major spoilers!: This movie was by far the dumbest excuse for elitist Hollywood to ram another subliminal morality message down our throats. Ironically, Klaatu and his consortium of allegedly advanced civilizations left more damage to the planet than they were trying to conserve.Furthermore, Klaatu never offered any explanation as to how humans were destroying the Earth - it was simply assumed to be an incontrovertible truth without any scientific evidence whatsoever. That's not factual at all, but typical to liberal propaganda.And if Klaatu and his crew were supposedly so much more fair minded and advanced, then why did they resort to any level of violence? There should have been no need to defend themselves at all. As a species, they could have simply persuaded us through electrical telepathy, like during Klaatu's lie detector test, similarly to how liberals play their zombie mind games anyhow.I especially appreciate the part when Klaatu informs the police officer who is about to shoot him, ""This will only hurt for a moment."", then proceeds to roll a vehicle to crush the officer between cars. Of course, Klaatu jump starts the officer back to life, but advanced beings would never place themselves in these predicaments in the first place.Symbolically, the final message is - the world would be a better place if civilization crumbled without a trace and without further consumption of our natural resources. I suppose that would leave us to run around in the forests subject to random predators and elements much like our ancestors did more than 10,000 years ago. Yes, I can definitely see how that existence would mark a tremendous improvement to our quality of life! Leave it to liberals and their hair brained fantasies.

547,dfoots,Pretty awful amidst high expectations,4,14 December 2008,"This is one of those movies where the trailer is better than the actual film. Keanu Reeves is one of my all time favorite actors, in large part due to the Matrix trilogy, but he has failed astronomically here.1951 would be livid. Where this movie peaks is when G.O.R.T. escapes from the underground chamber and havoc ensues. From there there is about 9 good minutes of movie and everything until the end falls short of amazing.The build up is incredible to the previous mentioned point of interest, but Jaden Smith's character is such a turn off from what is actually going on it made me angry such a role for him was cast. His talent is beyond this and could have been utilized with a much better on screen persona.There wasn't nearly enough destruction for the entire planet being in peril nor was there a true alien presence (Keanu plays an alien in a man's body and G.O.R.T. has bad timing with Iron Man being released recently) that enthralled me like the blips in the trailer did.If you like being let down by all means... you won't even be entertained with the special effects in this one.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Regardless, I would like to commend the director, producers, actors and writers on the following: 1) The effects were relatively believable as to not detract from the movie.2) If you had not known the actors from previous movies, characters such as Prof. Barnhardt would have been well portrayed. Viewers can see the intended contrast between government officials treating everything objectively, and the ""leaders"", as Connelly put it, treat things subjectively. 3) The use of Jacob Benson: he paralleled Klaatu and the alien intentions. First, he believed that Klaatu should be killed - but that was when he knew nothing about Klaatu and didn't realize how similar Klaatu and himself were. Then, after getting to know the alien and realizing that Klaatu had human traits, he began to support him.

They're not a hobby, they're a passion that grew in me from a very early age when my dad used to carry me on a Friday night, in my pyjamas under my coat,to the cinema that was literally 50-60 metres away on the corner of our street. Many of the movies that I saw in my childhood left lasting impressions on me, good impressions by the way, and as I grew up I was able to relive the magic of these movies when they were shown on T.V. The Day The Earth Stood Still is one of those movies...fantastic, simple, not over-burdened with lavish special effects or action, just a great story, told and acted so well by Michael Rennie and Co. I have no objection to any classic being remade in principal, look how well Peter Jackson lovingly (the keyword..lovingly)remade his favourite movie from his childhood. He handled it with tender care, using today's technology to enhance, not overshadow, what is after all a love story. If anything Peter Jackson made it, dare I say?, better. The love was now two-way instead of one-way. Now to my point, I usually only cry at sad movies, but after witnessing the butcher's mess that this movie is, I really felt like breaking down. It's like some idiot painting a moustache on the Mona Lisa and then having the temerity to expect us to applaud his work. I never tell people to not go to see a movie just because I have seen it and didn't like it...but in this case I'll say to older moviegoers who may have the fond memories that I have, if you want to see an inept desecration of a classic that is served up with such banality and a misuse of the best elements of the original, then go and see it....and weep!!!!",The Day the Earth Stood Still

I think most of the people didn't get it, this movie shows and mocks the stupidity of the government and how it would probably react with there guns,tanks and missiles witch of course had no affect and we the humans think that we are all mighty and every one is scared of us and the movie shows it. Kathy Bates as Regina Jackson did an amazing job at pissing me off as the stupid idiot of America that in the end discovers the stupidity of her and whom she was representing(The president of USA).Effects we're awesome, Keanu was made for the role of Klaatu, Gort was epic and transformed into these little bugs or flies that eat every thing man has made. Much better then if Gort in his original form would have destroyed the earth. and what i also liked was the way ""they""(ailiens) collected most of earths creatures like Noah's ark(the story). The script got a little messy in the end with a little Hollywood drama but nothing that got out of hand(unlike the ending of war of the worlds). I also liked that the director kept some of the features from the original.

There are plenty of sci fi stories out there, some of them incredibly good, in which the humans welcome the alien(s) cordially, and ask, ""What can we do for you?"" instead of trying to blow them away in knee-jerk fashion.(SPOILER) Even though this movie recycles the names ""Klaatu"" and ""Gort,"" and the scene with the scientist's blackboard, otherwise this really isn't a remake at all. There isn't even a scene in which the Earth Stands Still. And there's never any explanation of the purpose of the implant in the original mountaineer's hand. Of course, maybe it's just a ""disregard this moron"" warning, for someone who goes out in a blizzard in the Karakorums without putting up his parka's hood or sealing his neckline. He'd be frozen to death within the first half-mile.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
560,fumiosuzukii,Greater than the sum of its parts.,7,2 March 2011,"The Day the Earth Stood Still is by no means a cinematic masterpiece. As with any movie, plot holes are evident if you look for them. On the surface you have a sci-fi popcorn flick that is victim to many of the cliché trappings of any alien-invades-earth-it's-the-end-of-the-world film. What makes TDTESS different then is that at the heart of its convoluted and perhaps predictable script is a message about the human soul which should stay with you long after you've forgotten the plot.The casting is brilliant, and the contrast between Jennifer Connelly's delicate and vulnerable character and Keanu Reeve's stoic demeanor is great to watch. The movie is an emotional one, but not due to its melodramatic scenes - and in my honest opinion these were probably the weaker points in the film - but due to what they say about the greater picture. I've never seen the original and didn't go into the theater with any expectations. I wasn't looking for cheap thrills or even dramatic storytelling. What I got was an idea, and an inspiring one. If you've seen and enjoyed GATTACA or Dark City, you should definitely give this film a shot and go into it with a philosophical and open mind. From an artistic standpoint, the film makers could have done much more, but at the very least, I think we can appreciate the movie for what it tries to do.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Not only was his acting horrible but the classic kid character that's annoying, makes trouble, doesn't listen and runs away causing problems totally ruined everything that could have been good.

(No role for a Pres or VP, likely because this film was made in the middle of the US presidential campaign...Hollywood hedged it's bets.)

563,Kurios,Nowhere near as good,4,18 December 2008,"I was afraid of this movie after seeing the remake of 'The Manchurian Candidate"" Both the Manchurian candidate and TDTESS were always my favorite old movies. The themes and the scripts in both were politically and socially poignant, the acting was brilliant in both and the results were two fantastic movies. I'll give the remakers of the Manchurian Candidate the benefit of the doubt and say that they made an honest effort to update the story to modern times but fell short of that goal with a bad script and sub par acting (while Denzell was good Meryl Streep's performance of the mother was pale in comparison to Angela Lansbury completely chilling evil portray of the same character). I was afraid that the other of my favorite movies was going to be warped out of recognition. Unfortunately my fears were realized in TDTESS. The parts i loved about the original were the themes and the conversation...especially the conversations between Klaatu and the boy, not only teaching him about the universe but allaying the boys fears that were being broadcast across the media in reaction to the alien's presence. I was a clear diatribe about fears of racism and the unknown. IN the remake there was nothing of this. While agree with Klaatu's arguments that we are killing this planet and of the ultimate tragedy of existence if we let the planet die, this message was transmitting in 4 or 5 lines with very little effect. There was very little to this movie to like, the acting was sub-par. Keanu Reeves has more acting skill than was required for an emotionless alien of course, but it did not feel like it was well directed at all. There have been some successful remakes, but when you remake a classic it is important that the people who undertake the project is passionate enough about the original to do the project any justice. Its the same in music; so make remakers are simply done because they have run out of their own ideas (or never had many to begin with) so they half-heartedly recycle stuff they think no one has heard of.Of course its is fortunate in this world that those of us who appreciate good effort can still enjoy the originals. Its not like Denzell's and Keanu's bad remakers have replaced the classic originals.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Some human beings dare i say like (rarely) to enjoy the apple of the cinematic garden.Without doubt this film was as pretentious as the above statement, preaching about how we should change our world-killing ways. The legendary James Hong makes an appearance and he doesn't seem too fussed about all the world ending, humbling himself with a MacDonalds. Animation was brilliant, however a lot of the world-wide full CG scenes weren't called for - giving the film in places a strange glowing sensation. It's certainly too expensive for itself, with little cgi-bug things ripping up central park and generally looking expensive at the same time.Keanu Reeves does his thing, this time cast appropriately, however characterised so jarringly bi-polar he can drag the film into a wishy-washy sentimental shite-horn parade whenever there's an on-screen hug. The protagonist cast tend to be fairly varied, enjoyable - taking predictable turns and so on. The bonding between Conelly and Mini-Smith certainly doesn't feel as solid and Cruise and old-whats-her-face in 'War of The Worlds.' There's a 'queer' moment where suddenly sympathy is due for the idiot-military and ruling body when they realise they've done wrong. Sympathy however is not given.But, despite what grumbles i may have i set them aside for a film that is beautifully shot, epic, scored delightfully and edited perfectly.Go and see it, just don't go in your 'Day The Earth Stood Still' 1957 t shirt and be the obnoxious one who spoils it for others.cheers.

If it's true it's the fault of big business, which is condoned and supported by government so what we, the people, are supposed to do I have no idea.As to poor casting, it seems that every film with Jayden Smith has him playing a snotty little sh*t.

566,john_ferentinos77,A modern view including some old problems,8,8 December 2013,"The movie is OK as a sci fi flick but it is not centered that much on action but rather on philosophical and actual issues of humanity.An alien comes to our world born in a human body formed with dna aliens took decades ago from a sample,together with some weird shining spheres that land around the globe and a humanoid shaped kind of automaton.He is an emissary called clatu that represents a group of alien civilisations capable of interstellar travel.He comes to talk to the governments of the earth as a final attempt to cancel the decision to wipe us out after years of watching our self and planet destructive behaviour.The u.s government detains him trying to interrogate him just making things worse that they are.He escapes.A scientist and her annoying stepchild travel around with him while she tries to make him call of the impending destruction of the human race.This is a green film from the start.Anyone who doesn't have ecological issues will not like the premise.It is also a film that is not centered on mankind from the inside but tries to distance from it for a while so we can see how someone who is not a ""humanist""would see our race without blinders.It is also a movie that asks for ""justice from above""since humans are species biased and powerful enough on the planet to distort any sense of real morality.The acting is OK and the alien is believable and makes sense.The one plot hole I see is why the governments of the world do not press USA for answers since it is apparent that they made an overt fourth kind contact and this is a global issue.To end it the movie has a good message.That you should always try to put yourself into the other's place because you might not always be on top neither you have this as a birthright from nature or god.So real morality must bring some healthy humbleness with it towards life nature and existence instead of self centered or species centered vain greed and hostility.Good film.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
567,BobbyBoyTaff,*spoilers* It's no wonder the aliens wanna destroy us!,4,11 December 2008,"I wasn't expecting much from this film but I quite like Keanu so thought i'd given it a go......but now I wish I hadn't! It starts of so well, very curious, disaster is imminent, army, scientists, sets the tone well that something big is going to happen. Then Keanu arrives and again, very mysterious and feeling like we're watching a potentially very interesting Sci-Fi film - but then he goes on the run and it all goes rapidly downhill from there.To be fair to Keanu, he doesn't do that bad (hasn't got much to do mind) but he certainly wasn't terrible - kinda spooky and has good presence when on screen. The problem lies with how little actually happens around him.The special effects are seen-it-all-before stuff and as a result means the audience gets bored during these scenes - which is basically the whole last half hour - but they could've done SO much more with this story.The kid is incredibly annoying - a disruptive little brat who spends the first half of the film being a tough guy and the second half of it crying. And there's absolutely no point to his character being in the film! If Keanu's character would honestly stop the destruction of the world just because of a little boy crying over the loss of a loved one, then the aliens clearly hadn't done their research into this planets inhabitants in the first place really - therefore not really justifying the proposed destruction in the first place. Jennifer Connelly's character could quite easily of just been a single woman and the film would've had the same effect. I haven't seen the original fully so maybe this was key to the story in the original, but I understand the original to be an absolute classic and watching this as a neutral, it's seemed like a very weak way to end the film.All this film did was help to confirm that the American government really are as gun-happy and dumb as I originally thought they were and the scariest thought about this film is that if anything like an Alien invasion really did ever happen and they did happen to land in America, all of our lives will be in the hands of a bunch of power-mad controlling idiots who are going to shoot our visitors in the head on first sight and bomb the sh*te outta them  even when the president is told that original attempts to use weapons on them has simply made them MORE powerful, he STILL goes ahead and launches another attack!?? It's no wonder the aliens wanna destroy us  they think the whole world is made up of Americans!!! Ludicrous! Why don't Hollywood realize that the only films that should be remade are the ones that were cr*p first time around??!

As others have stated it's not bad--it just does not quite get there. All they had to do was to keep to the same simple story and update the special effects. In the original the religious references were very subtle--not so in this version. Advanced technology can appear to be mystical while still being scientific and not supernatural--this film goes too far in the supernatural direction. They do explain how Klaatu appears to be human (which was never done in the original) so at least they did some things right.

569,orangewarm,Destroying the earth - Again!,6,16 December 2008,"If media reflects its society's culture, then the Hollywood blockbuster, the most expensive and complex media around, may hold the key to Western society's deepest fears.Emerson said that ""fiction reveals the truth that reality obscures."" Some commentators (including Baudrillard) have said that Independence Day (1996) foresaw the events of 9/11  that it gave an insight into the subconscious hatred of American hegemony.I've just seen The Day The Earth Stood Still (2008), Keanu Reeve's latest sci-fi vehicle. It seems to me, that ever since Independence Day in 1996, Hollywood has been producing and exporting a wide variety of disaster movies which centre around the theme of ""destruction of the earth."" Communications Theory can be seen as an offshoot of Sociology  what this means is that, for a Communications theorist, newspapers, magazines, books, television, cinema and advertising are all open to interpretation. The hope is that, by interpreting or deconstructing these media, we gain a deeper insight into our society, and possibly human nature.In the 50s, Hollywood was obsessed with aliens and monsters wreaking destruction upon the earth. These images are said to have been manufactured as a conscious effort in the propaganda war against Communism  Communism being the destructive alien or monster.But it's too simplistic to say that in the 50s, Hollywood alien movies represented communism and now alien movies represent the threat of Islamic terrorism.The Day The Earth Stood Still is a remake of a 1951 movie, but the alien depicted in the original was hardly threatening. Actually, he brought with him a message of pacifism, calm and logic. His message was one of peace not subversion and war. Also, Independence Day was made before 9/11.The events of 9/11 temporarily abated film projects involving urban destruction, but only briefly. Spielberg's War of the Worlds (2005) and Cloverfield (2008) have definitive, obvious references to 9/11.There are several references to 9/11 in the The Day The Earth Stood Still: people running from smoke and dust in Manhattan, the dead father of the child in the film, who went to war to build, the child constantly shouting ""why should we help them?"" (the ""them"" being the aliens  representing Muslims). More telling still, The Secretary of Defence now represents America  not the President.The film reads like a party political broadcast for Greenpeace or Friends of the Earth, and is one a growing number of films including The Day After Tomorrow (2004), and M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening (2008), that purports to warn us about the dangers if we don't treat our planet right. Nature is literally fighting back in these films.What else do all these films have in common? They consistently show the destruction of structures. Starting with Independence Day, notice the buildings that get blown to smithereens: most notably The White House and The Empire State Building. The first building signifies the destruction of democracy, the second, the imminent demise of the American empire.In The Happening too, Shyamalan shows us that only the North East of America is affected  why? The North East represents the centre of Finance, Print Media, Television and News in America. Along with California, the North East is the wealthiest part of the US. It is as if Shyamalan is saying, all these structures have gone to ****.The Brooklyn Bridge has been destroyed twice: once in I Am Legend (2007), and once in Cloverfield. Could this signify souring relations between those in Manhattan and those in Brooklyn? Or, is it as some critics have said, that ""Manhattan is America"" and the destruction of the bridge signifies a wider chasm of American separateness.""Liberty"" has been under attack several times: in The Day After Tomorrow, we see The Statue of Liberty buried in snow  frozen; in Cloverfield, J. J. Abrams violently decapitates Liberty, hurling it like a weapon. Like in 1968, when we first saw Liberty damaged, buried in the sand in Planet of the Apes.Let us now look at the social representations in the films. Many of the films allude to the separation from loved ones: The Day after Tomorrow, The War of the Worlds, The Happening, Cloverfield, Independence Day, Armageddon (1998), I Am Legend and Deep Impact (1998) to name a few. But these films do not only show separation; they also reveal complex relationships and themes of adoption and surrogate parenting.In I Am Legend, Will Smith finds ""a wife"" and child that are not his own; in War of the Worlds, Tom Cruise is estranged from his children  a useless dad. In Armageddon, Liv Tyler has no mother; in the Happening, Mark Walberg is ""chasing"" his own wife and is forced to look after a friend's child. In Independence Day, Will Smith is going out with an ""exotic dancer"" who has a child  he has taken on the child as his own. In The Day The Earth Stood Still, it gets more complex still: the female lead is forced to look after a child that is not her own after the father and mother have died. What does this all mean?Hollywood would never have made films like these twenty years ago. What we can see is an obvious breaking down of the traditional family units of the last 100 years; traditional society is literally being torn apart, with a new restructuring of family and community taking shape.Former Mayor Ed Koch, who now keeps himself busy by reviewing movies for several newspapers in Manhattan, has attributed the persistence of the destruction theme to ""edifice envy."" ""They want to see our skyscrapers destroyed because they are envious of them,"" Mr. Koch has said. We can only assume the ""they"" is the rest of the world.Then again, all these theories could just be a lot of bull.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
570,mikshelt,"New ""Day the Earth Stood Still"" not bad but no cigar.",5,13 December 2008,"The 1951 Day the Earth Stood Still ran on the AMC channel so I viewed that version before watching the new one. The original was always a favorite of mine. The acting is unpretentious. There are bits of unintended humor such as when the doctors marvel at Klaatu's healing, then all lite up cigarettes. The highest level of the 1951 show is its ethical mission. The Earth needs to curb it warlike passions or it's people will be curbed. This 2008 version updates all of the characters and situations, and doesn't do a bad job. But the direction isn't anti-nuclear war and ending with a stirring speech before a worldwide audience to make war no more. Rather, its an environmental movie: We better save the world, or they'll save it from us. Only, no one outside of a few people ever hear his message. So, its wasted.I did enjoy his conversation in Chinese with a fellow alien on the fate of the Earth. I wish more of the movie had been like that. It strikes me in both versions while the aim is to speak with all of Earth's leaders in one place, like the UN, neither lands outside the UN. And, neither understands how difficult it is to bring dumb earth nations together. Why they didn't takeover the radio and television airwaves and tell everybody all at once is beyond me. On the bright side, the way Keanu Reeves' guys were going to exterminate the world was creative and fun to watch.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
571,Wolven_StarScream,Re-imagining Of Original With A New Message,7,13 December 2008,"What is wrong with critics lately??? It seems like they collectively decide which films they will like and which they will hate before they even come out. The major point here is that I did not think it was as bad as people said it was. I have to admit that I had mixed feelings about this movie initially. I kind of wanted to see it but I generally do not like remakes. There have been way too many of them recently. But I went to see it anyway and I'm glad I did. Here's why: 1) It is not really a remake. It is more like a re-imagining. They kept the same characters and same basic story about Klaatu coming to Earth, but the message is much different than the message from the original. It is a new, powerful message that I think everyone should hear and that relates very well to present day circumstances.2) As another reviewer said, it is one of those movies that makes you think, even though it's not particularly uplifting. It forces you to evaluate the future of the human race and our responsibility as a species on this planet. It is a bit heavy and ponderous at times, but not so much so as to make it a horrible movie. I think this may be the reason that many people, including some critics, didn't like it. They don't like being ""preached to"" by ""liberal tree-huggers."" They don't like being evaluated and judged.3) The special effects are breathtaking and I wish I could have seen it in I-MAX. Oh and GORT is extremely creepy. They did a great job with him (even though he's like 5,000 times bigger than the original GORT).There were a few things I didn't particularly like and some things that could have been done better, such as the ending and a few of the shots/scenes. The acting wasn't horrible but it could have been better in a few spots as well. Keanu did a relatively good job portraying Klaatu but at the same time there was something missing from his performance. Overall, it is not a bad movie. It has its flaws and is not a Michael Bay action extravaganza, but it is NOT boring or awful. It has a powerful message that some people may not like, a beautiful, almost enchanting story, amazing special effects and it is definitely worth seeing in theaters in my opinion, especially if you can see it in I-MAX.

I'm seeing this constantly in movies these days and am curious who is to blame. I have yet to see the original movie but am likely to do so given how much people remember and seem to enjoyed it.What is with all the cliché characters in this movie? Isn't there ever a leader in these movies that acts with any amount of intelligence? The secretary of Defense acts exactly like you would guess she was going to, without the ability to think things through and respond with a little consideration. She is after all under specific orders to act like a total idiot regardless of what happens.Typical moron military personnel. Lets attack the aliens, then once they very quickly prove we have no chance against them continue to try and destroy them, even before we know what they want. Nevermind diplomacy or intelligence gathering, we are total idiots that have been appointed to be our leaders, how else are they supposed to act?Unreasonable little kid who is a brat and annoying, impossible to like this character, wonder if that was the design of the original movie or (most likely) bad writing in the remake.Connely's character also behaves unbelievably rash, taking some sort of personal interest in the alien despite the risks, which while she actually seems to be the only one able to use her brain, she still behaves very oddly to me.Overall interesting story, I found Reaves portrayal as a good one, even if he moved like a robot I was able to believe he was a being not used to a human body.

I anticipated your standard big special effects, a well-cast Keanu as an emotionless humanoid, and, at best, perhaps some creepy and / or imaginative diversions from the original - as in War of the Worlds.That would have been just fine with me.What I got, was 104 minutes that amounted to nothing. That's 104 minutes of my life, gone, and I want them back. Keanu surprisingly contributed the most substance to this limp piece of work. Jennifer was OK. John Cleese, I love you, but where did you go? The kid was mildly annoying but tolerable, considering the over-bearing faults of this film which left me yelling at the TV in a dumb-founded stupor...To put it nicely (as I grit my teeth), this movie feels like someone really wanted to take a classic and remake it into an environmental statement, and rightfully so. But then about halfway through, a corporate exec from McDonalds stands up and threatens to pull back the funding if they don't make him feel less guilty about his career choice. So they had to edit out an hour or so of intelligent, substantial, and profoundly necessary content, if they still wanted the film to be released. So they hacked away at what could have made this movie watchable like it was a cow carcass on its way to Big Mac land. Perhaps this hypothetical edit was a mercy killing. One can only hope. Either way, it hurts. It hurts bad. I mean, the slap-in-the-face HYPOCRISY of discussing humanity's inexcusable destruction to the planet in a MCDONALDS of all places, makes me physically ill. I am not even going to think about the wake of waste, the butchering, the crops, water and fuel - squandered, all over the globe; or all that money that lines the walls of the golden effing arches. I mean, really? REALLY?! If that scene was supposed to have been ironic, why couldn't they have made it a bit more obvious? Why why why why why. Maybe it was a super hidden message. Maybe they were saying, ""Here. This is why the film goes nowhere. We are so so sorry."" Alas, at first watching, it still looks, and stinks, like blatant corporate sponsorship - nothing more. I mean, the scene wasn't even necessary to the plot (or lack thereof).The only possible thing that they could do to remedy this utterly depressing waste of time and resources, is if they made a pseudo-sequel, and really, REALLY stuck it to the man.

I guess Croatia had the first screening of the movie. wow :)Anyways, I didn't watch the original movie from 1951 but have a feeling all the main points of the plot are there. I respect that but also feel this is the main reason why movie is so one sided and has a lot more potential to it. First third of the movie is paced really nice, but trough second and last part tempo kinda slows down and you pretty much know exactly what's gonna happen. This movie is all about big message for humanity but the message it self is poorly developed. Acting is very good and main role is perfect for Keanu Reeves, being a neutral alien with no emotions :) (don't get me wrong, i love his work). Jason Smith who plays the kid will remind you why you sometimes hate the little brats.Story it self has some major flaws (biggest of them being: aliens have no idea what is love and they are not that intelligent) but I am guessing all of these were taken from the book/original movie and after all, this is a remake. It would be much better if they had loosen up a bit and added some deeper sens to the whole experience. This way, I'm guessing, there will only be a small group of people who will really appreciate this work. However, from technical point of view, this movie goes pretty far. It's shot good, sfx are almost perfect, but music is kinda dull and editing should also be better.All this critic and such a high rating? Yeah.. well, the movie has atmosphere and besides all it will hold you down to your seat through whole show.

I mean you can't do wrong with it.That was my bet.And even if i feared the newer version would happen to be some family movie version i guessed it would at least be intelligent and entertaining.Failed.Fair enough: The effects when it comes to destroying some symbols of humankind are overwhelming but 28 weeks later made a similar impression by having only a guerrilla team and some amateurs doing a rough epilogue (which worked just as nicely and felt somewhat better)Keanu reeves and his female collaborator do their best to keep us awake. And Reeves is completely engaging seeming willing to learn but still restricted to rational, non-emotional reactions.But now for the mistakes: The complete story and meaning is reduced to some short sentences, poorly written and hardly constructing some complex background.The officials, intelligence, scientists, military reacts unconvincing, dumb and slow. I mean who would not guess what the sphere was doing about 20 minutes before the movie made one of the people in control recognize it?!The artwork is a poor mix of 50s charm and 21st century design. The almighty robot looks like some 60 years old design which i liked first, but having to watch some tasteless flowing lights under it's surface i disliked it. Nothing fits together rightly. Surfaces look wrong (and this is not some alien, sci-fi meaning of wrong) and you have an amount of nebula objects only star trek could justify.The end is unconvincing, hastily done and somewhat roughI left the cinema feeling like i just watched some mildly entertaining afternoon comedy i could hardly remember.This movie neither leaves a lasting expression nor changes your mind over anything.And now for the worst. I am not the kind of person who is open for advertisement. I hardly remember the product a good ad tries to sell me but rather it's soundtrack. I don't even recognize labels in James Bond. But this movie had that much ads which just did not fit in in any sort of way that i was short of throwing up.First of all the scientists and the American government use windows, which might very well be given the sort of government America seems bound to, but please i never ever want to see that damn vista logo filling nearly the whole screen.Second the stupid lg handy which falls out of the girls bag when she packs and is put back in a moment for no reason or anything, but we all can see she uses LGLast of all: I did dislike that stupid, annoying, unconvincing little brat that much i nearly left the cinema!",The Day the Earth Stood Still
580,sasquatch27,A Wasted Effort,2,28 February 2010,"First, I think if a business decision is made to re-make a classic 50's sci-fi movie the first rule should be, ""We take the BEST elements from the original and keep them intact, loyal to the original."" In this version the only elements left intact were some of the character names. The heart of the original was removed for the sake of whatever ""new vision"" the writers and director had.I'll keep it short as many have echoed my feelings. I will say to those true film fans that are reading this, see the original 1951 version. Be aware that the SFX are minimal in this version. It wasn't about the SFX, the new unimproved version is about SFX. And that's a shame. This is a wasted effort.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
581,piercingeyes66,Not a bad film... not a great film,6,12 December 2008,"I have to disagree with Mason1945--in fact if there is anyone who is injecting a political perspective into this film it is him.Having seen the original I would say that this version, while not great, is a capable update of the original, with today's concerns, sensibilities and way of life represented in the film, as opposed to those of a half-century ago.Jennifer Connely's character is present in order to allow us to identify personally with the impending doom of the earth... this is a standard plot device and it doesn't work too badly at all. I thought that she was more than capable in her role as a vulnerable scientist trying to overcome her sense of fear in order to act.Keannu Reaves was his typical monotone / emotionally drained self. Unlike some movies, this didn't work to any detriment, as Klaatu is meant to be acted in this way... very sterile, very distant, very not of this place--so it's a decent match.Kathy Bates did a capable job as the bloodless Secretary of Defense. In this day and age, when a woman can hold the job as national security adviser and secretary of state, and come within a hair's breadth of the nomination for the presidency, the idea that any political job is a man's job is just out of touch with today.Other than that, there is nothing that distinguishes anyone's work in the film. It's plot driven, with very very little meaningful dialogue, and as a result nobody really shines, although nobody bombs either.All in all, it's not a bad way to kill 90 minutes.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
582,buckramega,The Day the Earth was Meh,6,14 December 2008,"This movie was not terrible. It just wasn't terribly exciting and the whole time just seeming to be lacking something. It was totally throwaway and forgettable. I had high hopes, went to see it in IMAX, and came away feeling meh. I had a better time coming up with fake titles on the way out of the door.Here are a couple of the more appropriate ones:The day the audience stood still. The day my pulse stood still. The day... wait, what were we talking about?Keanu was a perfect choice for the role, considering he was basically playing himself. I hear he is going to play a hunk of wood in his next movie.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
583,bradley-81,Don't make me open my visor...!,9,13 December 2008,"Sometimes I think people write movie reviews just to dust off film lingo like ""mise en scene"" or ""milieu"" without getting bitch slapped, and/or to heap clever abuse upon filmmakers and actors rather than offer any real analysis and criticism. Given, it is frequently in the nature of most online film reviews to be negative--due to the anonymity of the criticism, and because the contrarian antithesis to the filmmaker's thesis allows a faux 'creative' indulgence for non- filmmakers--and the abuse just piles on. This is especially true of classic remakes.Having read a number of reviews here of this 2008 remake of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" I see this predictably playing itself out again. If Gort were here, he'd open his visor and put an end to this vigilantism, or maybe unleash some nasty nanites into cyberspace to curb that most-aggressive of intergalactic species: the amateur film critic. Left to their own ferocity, they would subdue the world.I too was excited at the prospect of seeing this film remade. Then, having read some early reviews, I was expecting an apocalyptic melt-down of a disappointment. But I still went to the theater and now, having watched it during its premier general release here in the US, I was pleasantly surprised at what a really excellent remake this was. It's no easy task to take a superb classic like this one and reintroduce it to audiences, and I think it speaks volumes about the gutsiness of the director and producers to pull this off.The point of remakes is never to make ""better"" films than the originals. (All films are locked to their times, even ""timeless"" ones.) Rather, the point is to uproot the salient qualities of the original story and then cultivate them for present-day audiences. Sometimes--in fact, often- -what develops bears little resemblance to the original, as well it should. Whereas the original ""Day"" was largely about the Cold War, this newer version is about our planet and what we are doing to it. And frankly, it's message is more important than ever.The majority of criticism against the film here at IMDb is that it was either not like the original, or that it was too similar. And while this may look like ""criticism,"" it is overly simplistic and does not challenge us--nor filmmakers--to dig for something more valuable. It is fascinating that three recent films with an environmental message (""Inconvenient Truth,"" ""The Happening,"" and this one) have been gang-raped by corporate media critics. Besides the obvious insult to kleptocratic sponsors, could it be that relocating antagonists from the familiar realm of monsters, ghosts and silver-suited spacemen is just too unsettling for our twenty-first century psyches? If so, then this is one of the redeeming qualities of this remake: it forces audiences to rethink just who the bad guy(s) are. Walt Kelly, whose 1970 poster for Earth Day stated, ""We have met the enemy and it is us,"" readily comes to mind.To the point: ignore all the naysayers out there who whine that this version is ""not like the original,"" or that is ""trying too hard to be like the original."" Go see this remake of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" with an open, unbiased mind, and enjoy it. No, it won't tell you what to think about the questions it unleashes, but it will provide a most satisfying movie-going experience and give you a very great deal to think upon. My one complaint (and the only reason I won't give it ten stars): the last two lines in the film!",The Day the Earth Stood Still

However, I'm really glad I did as the special effects,story line, and acting were well worth it. It deviated from the original movie story line, however, this movie should be seen as a ""stand alone"" movie and not compared to the original. Some of the critiques wrote that Keanu Reeves showed no emotion and was stiff in his acting, however I don't think he would have been believable as an alien had he acted any other way. Kathy Bates and Jennifer Connelly were excellent in their parts, and even the little boy played a good (if not a little corny) role. The only disappointment was in the ending when the globe-shaped space ship left without the warning to earth that ""man must change or be destroyed"" as depicted in the original movie.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
586,Peace_Forever_Lover,This Movie Was Average At Best,4,26 December 2008,"MY REVIEW for The Day The Earth Stood Still (2008)I just saw this movie a few hours ago and I just thought to write a short simple review. Forgive me for any grammar mistake and spelling error.Before seeing the movie, I heard lots of bad things about it. So, I watched the movie while expecting it to be worse and worse as time passed by. Know what, the movie was not that bad at all, at least, for me. But it was not that great either. It was acceptable yet easily forgettable owing to the weak story despite having quite good performances mainly by the lead actress and great special/visual effects.The opening scenes were intense and so mysteriously convincing. The beginning was fast-paced in a satisfying way and the movie kept me interested for the first few minutes, maybe even more than half of the movie. The movie contains some cool action scenes but none of them left any huge impact on me but as I said, I did keep my expectations low so that I wouldn't be too disappointed. In the end, the movie is average at best.The best thing about the movie was neither the Klaatu nor the special effects nor even the plot but the acting by some of the cast primarily by Jennifer Connelly. She was surprisingly good in her role and her acting was stellar and steadily good and quite convincing in this movie. The cast around the board was generally good. Keanu Reeves as the alien, Klaatu was also good as well to me but definitely could have been better. So was Jennifer Connelly's acting but she was better in overall to me. Maybe Keanu has found his perfect role, maybe not. But in my opinion, I thought he was slightly better in Constantine than in this.Other than the cast, the visual and special effects were also quite satisfying and good but none of the actions I found to be breathtaking or astonishing. All in all, the effects were acceptable and OK and for some parts, great.But as I said, the movie didn't leave any huge impact on me. I was quite glad though that I was not too disappointed with the movie since I already reduced my expectations in the first place. It was a quite satisfying and acceptable cinema experience all in all. And, how predictable the ending is but still okay though given the stellar performance by the lead actress and some great special effects and action sequences.In my honest opinion, this is the kind of movie that is worth checking out once only. It will soon be forgotten I believe.4/10",The Day the Earth Stood Still
587,niococli,"While not a bad movie, it's like so many remake's it didn't live up to the original.",5,15 December 2008,"My hopes that the remake of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", would be a combination of the excellent Org. movie with some more elements of the original story ""Farewell to the Master"" by Harry Bates(Read it at thenostalgialeague.com). were dashed.While not a bad movie, it's like so many remake's it didn't live up to the original. Like the big disappointment I felt from the ""War of the Worlds"" remake. Though this was better than that one.The story starts to draw you in at first, but after Klaatu gets shot and Gort appears thats it. The story falls flat it could be any other disaster/scifi/Greenpeace movie.Keanu Reeves was OK as Klaatu. If he had just been given a more solid story and lines, to develop and make his character more believable, as Michael Rennie was able to do in the orig. movie.As for Gort the CGI could have looked a lot more realistic. the doorman from Grauman's Chinese Theater in the Gort suit looked more realistic. They could have used the effects used to create the liquid metal Terminator robot.As for Jaden Smith all I wished for was that he was encased in something or that Gort would step on him. He added nothing to the movie, Billy Gray/Bobby Benson in the orig. was more of a actor and had a much better interaction with Michael Rennie/Klaatu in the orig. than Jaden did with that be a whiny brat every scene.As for the alien that had lived here. Why was that scene even in this movie? That just blows the whole Klaatu learning about the people of earth out of the water.As for John Cleese as Professor Barnhardt, he was great and thats one of the best scenes in the movie. I would have liked to seen a couple of more scenes with Cleese, like Sam Jaffe as Prof. Barnhardt had in the orig. movie.I'll leave all the plot holes to others, this was a OK movie. But it won't top the original one.A remake doesn't have to be just like the Original one. But it should learn from the original, take the things that made it great and made people like it and use that as a foundation to make a greater movie.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
588,dawsims,was not impressed,1,10 April 2009,"The movie was sad. Not the ending just the effort by all involved. The theme seemed to be very simple. All humans bad But American humans are the worst of all. In the original we feared the unknown and responded mostly out of fear. In this one the only good alien is a dead alien. Most of the cast did not seem to believe the lines they were saying. Almost every one in the movie seemed to be disinterested. It was like they had about 6 different ideas about the feel in the movie and all the action was in different directions. If we are the worst that the universe has to offer and we are destructive and aggressive what does it say about a superior level of being that believes that their method of fixing the problem is total destruction of ""complex lifeforms"" and starting the planet over as a desert. It seemed to me that they were much more violent and cruel than us. You would think they would at least put us down humanly instead of robot bugs devouring.

I have never seen a more perfect example of disrespect and bad manners to be taught to children. In the past, movies taught respect and good manners to be taught to children. This was just the opposite. Teaching disrespect and horrific manners in a child. Next, the plot ""Change"". Whew we are sick of hearing that. For example look what the socialist Obama that rode into the presidency on the back of Judith LeBlank's communist horse. (for those that don't know. Judith LeBlank is secretary of the communist party of the USA. Look it up on the net. She is the one that organizes the anti war rallies and helped ""Organize"" people that show up to rally's like Obama's) He made all America sick by misleading the country by really meaning ""change"" to socialism. If you don't believe this then look up the book ""Rules for Radicals, the book as written and taught by the admitted communist Saul Alinski to Obama. In that book the real plot of change is revealed and is more scary than any movie could portray. In that book change means change to socialism. Look it up. Look it up. Any way as that relates to this movie when they said we need change. I was so sick of hearing the socialist dribble that it made me want to up chuck.

593,Freeskier21,Expected More,4,2 May 2009,"This movie is a victim of its own hype and clever editing on the trailers. There are several reasons why this movie doesn't work, although it did have potential. The first reason: The Army isn't retarded. They are portrayed as cro-magnonesque, flying 2 Raptors in to fire on the GORT which ultimately fails, leaving someone whom we are assumed to be in command saying to an airplane hangar full of troops ""Anybody else got any ideas?"" Secondly, the military would be in charge, and there would be much more collusion between department heads then led to believe. Kathy Bates, who gave an average performance (probably not her fault, her script was bland) is the Secretary of State, and seemingly the Secretary of Earth, as none of the other world leaders are even involved. Instead of world leaders, we have Jennifer Connelly, an astrobiologist, calling the shots. It isn't really plausible that the US military would allow a civilian to be the first contact for alien visitors.Acting was....OK. Jayden Smith needs a little work, but again his script was pretty poor, as is the editing with some cutaways with him and Klattu. Keanu was a pleasant surprise, as he looked and acted as stoic and un-feeling as possible, and did it well. Jennifer Connelly held her own, but wasn't fantastic.The end of the movie is abrupt and anticlimactic. There seems to be a reason that this was released in the winter, as it didn't have the punch to be a summer action blockbuster. 4/10.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

595,mnmarkonissinen,Cinematographic touchdown,9,13 December 2008,"I consider this to be a good movie. Mainly so, because of Mr. K. Reeves controlled, 'economical', plain, meager, focused acting, but the story is also good. The original version made on 50's was also a very good movie, but the times has changed. Science-fiction is actually rather difficult genre, if one wants to make somehow plausible movie with rather convincing story. Problem is not so much in lack of imagination, than in tendency to 'overlap' the limits of good taste and finally end up in the mess. To present a sort of an epitome of it;-if the volume of action in the movie EXCEEDS the strength of the STORY, it causes great problems in the narrative quality, losing cinemas explicit 'coherence'. Imagination, elegance, rhythm, economy, sensitivity, strength of the narration and intensity (to name just a few 'elements') working TOGETHER in 'harmony' reduces UNNECESSARY action, IF the film is to be taken (more) seriously. In (more seriously taken) Science-Fiction, fight JUST for the fight is pointless and naive. Conflict-situation should more like 'emphasize' something, bring forth 'something' in the culmination-phases rather than just brutally solve problems. Despite of the critics, the last ""Indiana Jones""-movie was rather good in it's narrative tempo and in adjustment all along. Final episode with 'Crystal Aliens' was particularly well depicted, in my opinion. It's very easy to spoil things, you see.

This rapidly changed however. One of the reasons I was not a big fan of the film ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind"" was that it was, well, really dumbed down and outright patronizing and yes, the remake of the great original ""Day The"" fell into the same pit of patronizing and arrogance. In Close Encounters you had an extremely advanced civilization from light years away and who were technology wise eons ahead of us reduced to finishing a silly musical expression- that was just so wise of us? Wasn't it? Almost along long the lines of when your trying to signal somebody by banging on a pipe and having the other person do the final two bangs. I think emus show greater sophistication... And in ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" remake you have an alien who is part of a group who has had a presence on this planet for 80 years suddenly figure out that human beings can show compassion to one another and are indeed capable of change. He witnesses this with the interaction of Jennifer Connolly character and her son and he suddenly decides that were worth saving after all, so he ends the systematic destruction of humanity and goes back to his ship and takes off and everything is fine, the end. Bad. Real Bad. If humans really think that aliens are this shallow and unsophisticated we deserve to be destroyed for our pompous arrogance.There are some good points, the CG stuff is stunning, all the elements seem to be there to make a really good movie but the butchering of a real good story ruins everything. If it had only stuck more to the original story line it could have been great- Benevolent space fascist who come here, make a huge point by making everything powered stop and telling us that if we take are aggressions to space we will be reduced ""to a burned out cinder"". I often wish someone like this would come and eliminate that piece of real estate in Jerusalem {the place where the Dome Of The Rock sits atop the Temple of David} ""Because you can't stop fighting about it , we will just reduce the whole thing to ashes, take it off the table and give it a half life of a hundred thousand years"" Perfect.What has happened to this huge budget remake is almost along the lines of having a really tricked out , uber extravagant Ferrari at your disposal and turning it over to some idiot who fouls the engine up by filling it up with diesel ..The original film was actually quite quaint when compared to the big time special effects of today but none the less still a classic. The remake with everything it had at its disposal sans decent writing- could have been wonderful, the pieces were in place and it was driven off a cliff by idiots. All the special effects in the world cannot cancel out insipid writing, ever. Oh, did I forget to mention that Keanu Reeves is a really wooden actor? How is that for a profound statement? Right along the lines of ""OJ really did kill his wife"" or ""Nuclear war is bad "" .I remember about 10 years ago asking a film buff friend of mine {One Jose Sinatra} ""Bill, why have they not remade The Day The Earth Stood Still?"" His response was simple, he said ""Darryl, your such a A#%hole!""Maybe some classic movies should just be left alone...duhduduuuuh !...god, how many time this has proved true, The Jazz Singer or A Star Is Born comes to mind.Don't waste your money going to the theater to see this, rent it if you must, but don't give this movie any undeserved box office....there are a ton of much better movies out now..D",The Day the Earth Stood Still

But i thought i'd go and watch it with my bros. as nothing really good was on at the time.I haven't seen the original so can't compare and so i am judging my view on this movie as it is.Acting but Keanu was as many say stiff but he is playing as an alien so he has to be emotionless. Jennifer Connelly just yet another great job and Will Smith's son wasn't bad at all for his debut movie.I have to admit with others it starts off fantastic but the end isn't as good as one would expect but hey it has to climax one way or another. I think it just needed a few more minutes in the end for it to have been better.The special effects are fantastic so this is one key factor to watch it in the cinemas especially in IMAX. If you want to take your family out or girlfriend to the cinemas go watch this I'm sure she (girlfreind) would get engrossed into it and the kids would love it special effects-wise.Even if the story or dialogue etc isn't good the special effects make up for it allowing for a good sci-fi action, thriller.In the end these reviews are based on opinions and are one sided. Mine really isn't as i'm not comparing it to old film or how the script was done or this and that wasn't in place etc. I'm telling you what the film is like as it is.Truthfully this movie has seriously been underrated.I think you would agree its better to watch this kind of movie at the cinemas than a Christmas flick.

Humanity is thus twice cued to 'wake up', but it seems that until a real GORT arrives it may just remain a 'surreal movie'! Something 'out there' to be 'judged'....anyone see the irony in this?So - as far as the movie goes - it's not too bad. Sure, aficionado's of the original WILL have lots to pick holes in. But as a movie in it's own right it does not fail as utterly as some seem to think. But that is always subjective. I liked it. And if i had to pick a singular distracting point to the movie it would be the 'new' character of the little boy....a very irksome little critter he portrays. And I did not fall asleep, the plot was 'relatively' well done and if only they had used the mega bot GORT more it could had quite a punch! (pun intended).But to me the real part here is the message that is rather well delivered. Clear, Cleese and concise! A message that is SO relevant right now.

I did like the 21st century update of Klaatu's reasons for coming to Earth, and it is a nice touch, given the precarious times we live in, but I thought The means of delivery were ridiculous and hastily dreamt-up. The close-up shots of the devices were unnecessary, and for me, counter-productive. Main stars were very good, especially Keanu Reeves and Jennifer Connelly. The inclusion of her character's stepson, unfortunately was a major annoyance, and on more than one occasion in the cinema, I wanted to yell out at him to shut up, or words to that effect. On the whole, there have been been better remakes ( I think War of the Worlds was better done ) and much better movies this year. A very good opportunity not fully made the most of.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Expressionless face, wooden movements, spacey stare.... that's exactly how an omnipotent alien who's been fit into a new body would act, no? And we all know that's where Keanu's a real specialist. I went into the cinema without much expectations. The first 10 minutes were glorious and I started to build up some level of anticipation. But that all came crashing down the moment Gort came out of the spaceship. This movie is just bad, bad, bad. Bad acting (even Jennifer Connelly was bad, and Kathy Bates was such a disappointment), bad writing (big gaps, inconsistencies, completely predictable for every minute, ZZZzzz), bad directing. What a let-down. I've not seen the original, nor heard about it until now...

602,arvshi007,Waste of time and money,1,12 December 2008,"what a waste of time and money. i should have spent this money on either partying or doing some other useful stuff.to begin with i had high hopes from this film considering the fact that it is a remake of 1951 classic film with the same name. the original 1951 make was classic in every way: the content, the screenplay, the direction, the dialogs, the meaning etc even though it was low on graphics. this 2008 remake, to begin with started off well but from after say about 5 minutes the movie loses its track. throughout this movie keanu reeves is trying to imply that the earth is on the verge of self destruction because of ""MANKIND ITSELF"". what the heck? what does he mean by it. at least the writer could have thrown some light on this. how is mankind destroying earth which is their only inhabitable planet. he could have told the reasons of this end of the world theory. till the end i couldn't understand. keanu reeves keeps saying one thing ""the people living here are destroying the planet"". from what and using what and how? he tells that he needs to recycle earth from human beings. somebody ask him who does he represent and on whose orders he is doing it. he keeps on bragging that he needs to talk to the leader of the world. and guess what who is the leader of our world ""A NOBLE PRIZE WINNER WHO IS A MATHS PROFESSOR WHOSE EQUATION MISTAKES ARE CORRECTED BY REEVES"". there is no peace talks, nothing. in one part the boy calls the cops to get reeves arrested.obviously the boy must have told the location to the authorities. while running from reeves the boy is about to fall off the bridge and is saved by reeves. the boy then tells him ""HELP ME OUT OF HERE AS I Don't KNOW THIS LOCATION"". what the heck. then how come the boy called the cops to that location. there are many loop holes, no wait, indefinite loop holes in the movie.the movie dragged on its face from start to end. no movie content, unimpressive dialogs, poor screenplay, poor direction. a mockery of original classic (a parody to be precise). it is awful. watch at your own risk and if you like wasting time and money. i was very very disappointed.1/10 for graphics only.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

When you come up with the good message ppl say who asked for a message we want entertainment.when a entertainment flick is made they say it pointless. To me a good movie is when you forget how the 2 hrs was spent. I went for this movie with 3 of my friends. All of us like the movies pace. We never had time to think of whats wrong whats right.Excellent time pass if that is what we watch movies for.The gort was made into those tiny dust kinda things to resemble flood ...to look like doomsday....thats pretty smart commercial thinking though a debatable one.

I therefore have no desire to see cardboard sets and egg-carton robots with 'scary' light-bulb lasers (sorry original film fans).Having nothing to compare this film to I think gives me an advantage.I wanted to see this film purely because I always enjoy watching Keanu Reeves and was interested to see him paired with Jennifer Connelly as he always seems to work the chemistry well with his leading ladies. I wasn't expecting much from this film as I'm not a huge fan of 50's sci-fi, however I was gripped from the first appearance of the space bubble and the scenes of apocalyptic Manhatten (where else!) to the 'nail biting to the quick' finish. I rarely watch a film that I don't criticise at least a little when it's over but this just did it for me. It entertained me from start to finish, what more can you ask.I even enjoyed Will Smith's kid's performance, he was so cute and funny standing up to Claatu.Hurrah to the cast and crew.

605,gmbialk,How To Ruin A Classic,2,22 December 2008,"Growing up in the 50's & 60's, I grew up with the original Day The Earth Stood Still and had memorized Klaatu's famous words my whole life (in case I ever needed to disarm Gort). I was about as excited as anyone when I saw the first preview come out and had hopes that I would be seeing my favorite black and white sci-fi movie replaced with an all new, up to date, high tech remake. Well, it was a major disappointment. The story line was damaged beyond compare as they added stupid scenes as the army leader with the hillbilly accent attacking Gort, the terrible casting for the secretary of state and the whiny little kid who kept changing his mind. The worst disappointment was that this movie seemed to be another pitch for how we are ruining this planet for our animal friends. The little Noah's Ark spheres were ridiculous.You may be one of those people (like me) who has to see this movie no matter what you read about it. If you are, keep your expectations way low. If you are not, let me encourage you to just rent or buy the original and leave your memory of the original unscathed and save your hard earned dollars.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
606,obloja,Wrong on so many levels,1,18 January 2009,"This movie for me was beyond awful. Last time i saw a movie that annoyed me off as much as this one,was...i don't know when. Just an awful movie,probably directors thought special effects only will do the job.Don't know really where to start. OK first of all,at the beginning when they gather everyone from all walks of life in what science means,why? They thought it was a celestial body or some sort(the micro black hole comment by a ""scientist"" was a killer,since they couldn't detect a black hole to the means they were tracking it,let alone see it on Radar,since the black hole would just absorb all the radar waves,or if that wasn't a radar was just a computer approximation of the target's projected trajectory,no way would telescopes could discover a 100 meters wide sphere from hundreds of millions of miles away) but they had this protocol,like an alien life biologist could help them in any way(any life carried by the celestial body would be destroyed on impact),as with the others.And those spheres,why were they moving with 30000 km/s? An advanced civilization as i presume they are,should have the technology to move much faster,unless they bothered to travel for 10000 years at least at a small cosmological speed,just to tell us they want to exterminate us.And they detected one sphere,but failed to detect the hundred other spheres that were heading thowards Earth?Then they can't launch their missles,1 minute and something seconds,before the celestial body hit earth.They wouldn't even gotten out of the Earth's atmosphere before impact,let alone deflect the body.Also just before impact,why was the helicopter filled with ""the greatest minds"" on earth hovering over Manhatten,the place where the impact should occure?!When the alien lands,someone shoots it...Pardon my french,but who the flux shoots an alien in an encounter. Maybe some crazy drunk fool,but no way do soldiers following orders would shoot it. Did they have any ideas about its intentions? Why do any hostile movements? Yelling medic after someone shoots an alien its priceless also.Also,when the horrible played ""secratary of state"" mentions that when advanced civilizations meet less advanced ones,usually the result is enslaving or exterminating the less advanced one. Well did she/they really thought that by showing hostility towards the aliens/robot would help their cause? Also same things apply to all other people,as Will Smith's kid,saying about fighting...They didn't show hostility?! Why would you want to start a war with a much more advanced civilization????!The Robot looks humanoid. Why? They made it so we wouldn't feel threatened by a robot that only activates when subjected to violence?!The aliens weren't humanoids in looking,from what the alien said.The Sphere lands in Manhattan...Why? Didn't the alien want to speak with the leader of humanity(not to mention they have been following earth,they should have known we haven't got a leader),did he expect to find him in Central Park? Why not the White House?Putting an alien thru a lie detector is such stupid...No matter how you look at it,if someone actually did this i would kill myself in shame of being a human,as i don't think your average Joe would take decisions when it comes to that matter.The talking in Japanese/Chinese in the coffee shop was just stupid. Why not talk in English. An intelligent being could've learned English in 60+ years on Earth,the average non-English speaking kid from a developed country knows English by the age of 10?There's much more stuff that probably i'm not remembering right now,and i'm sorry,but think i covered some issues.Now to the acting.I'm not gonna exaggerate by saying doing this film with people off the street would've been just the same.The acting was horrible,and Keanu Reaves makes me stop going to see movies in which he is cast in. Really. I cant stress enough what poor acting performances you see in this movie. Its like you see a bad movie that comes straight to DVD.Last to not prolong this,is i would like to express one final opinion.I hate,and i repeat I hate,how movies like this see the light of day,in which producers expect to make money by sheer special effects only,no trying to show at all that cinematography it's art.Tens of million of dollars spend on something that got me really annoyed..What is really the point of that? Do producers really think we are that stupid and make money with whatever they trow at us???Now for final words,i want to apologize for my grammatical/spelling mistakes,English is not my primary language,plus i had a few glasses of wine. Avoid this movie if you consider yourself a thinking person,that doesn't get fooled by special effects.Can't stress enough how producers think that special effects are just like a shiny thing that hypnotizes it.No matter how bad the movie/acting is they expect us when we see good special effects,"" we be like oho shinny shinny thing"".",The Day the Earth Stood Still

O.K I mean, I'll admit the first 20 minutes or so are pretty good and pretty intriguing it sort of leaves you wondering whats going to happen next but thats it for decency, after Klaatu and his big friend come out of that sphere its just conversation, after conversation, after pathetic action sequence (involving a man falling off a chair) after conversation. Utterly, utterly boring remembering its supposed to be A Sci-Fi/Disaster movie! as far as I know good disaster movies don't involve wittering on and on for two and something hours about F**K all.

609,Mr-Obviously-serious,Are you sure you were watching??,10,20 April 2009,"I am new on this website. I would like to first address 1 of many points. I watched this movie without seeing the earlier versions. I would like to first point out that in several of the comments i have read a lot of people seemed to miss out on details and asked questions they would know the answer to if they watched. This movie had a great ending. Keanu Reeves left and saved the world. He's an alien i would have thought it fake if he had said goodbye and all that sob story. Hes an alien incapable of showing expression of anger and so on so forth.The movie touched on the evolution of mankind. I think it has an excellent point it shows a belief that people can change if they want to. The effects were great everyone seems to agree on that.I would like to quote a certain comment i caught a glimpse of but forgot the name of the user, He said,""What happen to Gort?"" Uh he turned into a massive plague that was about to wipe life off the face of the earth.Maybe we weren't all watching the same movie. Klaatu aka Keanu Reeves character saw a different side to mankind because of how the boy felt about his dad. Do we all love our Dads? Would we cry too if our Dads died? I agree with a little bit of what some people stated and yes it could have been jazzed up a bit. But i believe that some alien who is about to kill us all because we are destroying a planet, who saves us from certain death needs some credit. Hes an alien for crying out loud hes not gonna wave and smile at us and walk away. Not only that he is not capable of emotion anyway. The threat was there even if it was unspoken. The world was almost obliterated in the first place. DUH don't you see? He didn't have to say anything. Look around you many people are dead signs were ripped away and many buildings demolished because of ""our recklessness"". Its the unspoken quality that really gives the movie a twist. If i flip you off i don't have to swear at you for you to understand what I'm saying.Keanu Reeves was an excellent choice for the part. He is very good at not showing any emotion in his character. Jennifer Connolly played a good role. If you believed that the earth was going to be leveled would you not try to plead with the alien who could stop the world from being leveled? I agree with the comment DMCNEIL2 made about the scientists but there was nothing anyone could do. If it was true that the object was speeding towards earth it wouldn't matter where they were as they would all be dead anyway. But believe it or not it slowed down and no matter where they were yet again, it wouldn't matter they were in fact all alive because the speeding object stop speeding. Actually if you think about it Gort became a massive metallic bug that could eat anything, great a new technology to research.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

In my opinion, there's is no need to be extremely logical when it's a Sci-Fi Movie or an Action Movie either.The acting was good, but not extraordinary.

Exactly how long is industrial society going to be ""shut off""? (And I'm not sure how you do that without changing the laws of physics.) If the shutdown is permanent, most of us are dead anyway. The Earth can't support 6 billion plus people on pre-industrial tech.

612,drdoom1951,One of the Worst Remakes of all Time,1,12 January 2012,"Hollywood could have made an excellent remake of this 1951 classic. Instead of using State-of-the-Art special effects and staying true to the character development of the original, as well as the moral lessons learned at the end of the film, it tries to instill ""political correctness"" where it doesn't belong. There was not one character in the movie that made me like them, except maybe Jon Hamm's character, because I sensed he had deep feelings for Helen Benson. Keanu's Klaatu had none of the charm of the original, and Jaden Smith's Jacob Benson was inferior to Billy Gray's Bobby Benson. It's too bad, really.

613,timtam468,I decided one of my first reviews would be on the movie I hate the most..,1,22 December 2012,"I remember several years ago watching this film. I dunno about the Earth, but I had a hard time watching it! In fact, I don't really know if I can review the ending, because I fell asleep half way through after watching this disaster. When woken up by another bored friend who was laughing hysterically at how bad this movie was, I found entertainment in a lady beetles journey from the bottom of a soft drink can to the top, which was far more exciting than the movie. I also noticed somebody else's comment about the ""1951"" fan-boys not appreciating this film because it is a remake. Well, I do not think that the oldies are annoyed because it is a remake- because coming from someone who hasn't seen the original, and never will due to this film which ruined the concept for me forever, I think they just know how poor the effects, storyline and acting are. It's very rare you can't find a single area of a film that shines in a movie that is complete horror- The Godfather 3 had decent music to make up for the awful acting in comparison to the first 2, for example. But this is one of those few exceptions- if you are thinking of buying this movie, make sure you are buying it for Christmas day in 3 days time, because the only thing this movie is good for is giving away as a gift. That is if you want to lose friends and get a divorce from a soon to be bitter spouse. Don't say I didn't warn you. In conclusion: This is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I'm not joking. To prove this is the worst movie, as someone who doesn't do many reviews, I have written a long and well thought out review to warn you of the safety precautions that need to be taken in order to watch this movie aka. Do not watch this movie whilst awake! I hope I have ensured that many victims are not sucked into watching this dreadful, and if you are forced to sit through a couple of hours of horror like this, I wish you luck because you will really, really need it.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
614,hartgh,Why The Title?,1,5 April 2015,"I've loved the original 1951 version of this movie since first seeing it and being mesmerized by it as a young kid in the '60s. I make it a point to watch it every 3-4 years.I am always very hesitant to see remakes of great movies that I love, I'm almost always disappointed. This movie was no different. I wonder why someone would venture to presumably improve a Mona Lisa. As a stand alone movie, I might have rated it a three to four stars, but given that it's a poor remake of a masterpiece, it only rates one.(I'm going to complain about what they left out from the original, is that a spoiler?)They took a great story, filled it up with CGI, and then left out the two best parts of the story, one of which is the title, ACTUALLY having the Earth stand still for a day--for crying out loud--and Klaatu's great line, ""Klaatu, barada nikto."" What's the ""logic"" behind having this vastly superior being, Klaatu (Keanu Reeves), even interact with the humans, and then be moved by inferior human Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly)? (Reminds me of Star Trek where the giant-cranium-aliens think humans are worthless warmongers, until Captain Kirk passionately shows them the ""wonderful"" human qualities that they've lost pursuing intellectual growth.) Klaatu kills, then heals a policeman, all the while preparing to wipe out the humans--the reason for which is never really well explained. The stretches in logic are stunning.Gort (the name of that fabulous robot in the '51 version, played by the 7'7"" Lock Martin) is just about wasted as a character in this movie. Making him bigger didn't make him better. (Wasn't it handy, though, that the Army just happened to have a cage that fit him!) Is it necessary for every child portrayed in TV/movies to be uppity know-it-alls? I will toss two bones to the ""movie makers,"" the reason behind the opening sequence is somewhat clever, and casting the always stunningly beautiful Jennifer Connelly in the lead made it almost bearable to watch, but that hardly makes up for the rest of this mess.SKIP THIS MOVIE, go directly to the 1951 version, IF you can get past the fact that the 1951 version is in black and white (gosh, you'll have to use your imagination!) has no CGI (use that imagination again) and uses arcane concepts like great story telling and character and plot development.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
615,george-lasher,One of the biggest cinematic disappointments of my lifetime,1,22 October 2010,"Spoilers included...One of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time, the 1951 version of Day the Earth Stood Still, needed a sequel more than a remake, especially if the remake had to be scripted by two untalented writers and directed by someone with less experience than such a highly anticipated film deserved. Keanu Reaves is not the reason this film failed, although I felt the alien should have been someone a little older. This film fell apart when the writers decided unnecessarily to make some kind of ethnicity tolerance point by forcing a black child into the role the lead female's son. Wil Smith's son is not as bad of an actor as this film makes him appear to be. The kid has some talent, but the script had him going from I hate this guy and don't trust him, to I love this guy in the blink of an eye, with no legitimate reason for the sudden transformation. There are some decent CGI effects, but this film is not worth renting, or owning, or watching on cable. A complete disaster.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
616,nmustelin,"An Alien entity arrives on Earth, with one Extra Terrestrial claiming to come to save the Earth.",9,14 January 2014,"Dr. Benson (Jennifer Connelly), a scientist researching possible alien life on Jovian Moons, arrives at home to her Step Son Jacob (Jaden Smith), whom she supports as a single parent. She receives a phone call and shortly there after she is picked up by a government agency that convinces her to come with them to a secure location. Her Step Son Jacob stays with a neighbor while she is away.It is explained during the briefing that a celestial body is approaching Earth, making it clear that the destination is in the US, specifically Manhattan in New York City.After an expected fatal impact does not occur, an enormous Luminescent Globe lands in Central Park, New York City.Out from the Globe comes Keanu 'Stone-face' Reeves as the Alien Klaatu, an entity that is 'born' into a Human body by obtaining a DNA sample that the Aliens took from a Mountain Climber a number of years earlier.After the Alien Humanoid form exits from the giant Sphere it is shortly followed by a giant Cyclops Robot which disables all guns, cars and other machines in the vicinity, since the Humans operating them appear like a threat with poised guns, blazing sirens and powerful search lights. The scary looking huge Robot sends out a signal that resembles an EMP pulse and a screeching sound, also causing pain to all Humans and a few police dogs. The Alien Humanoid, covered by some sort of Bio-Suit, is accidentally shot, but not fatally so. They take the body to a nearby make-shift Military tent hospital. The Robot remains inert outside the Globe in Central Park.Inside the infirmary tent, the Alien quickly transforms into Klaatu and rapidly evolves, finally becoming an Alien completely without emotions. I think this role is perfect for Keanu Reeves who is known for his stone-like facial expressions.Klaatu is unsuccessfully interrogated and escapes the Military facility.Dr. Benson locates Klaatu on a train station. They drive off to a nearby MacDonalds where Klaatu meets a fellow Alien, Mr. Wu (James Hong) who has stayed on Earth for a long time. Mr. Wu has learned to love his 'fellow' Human Beings. Klaatu simply states that the mission is still a go and the Process will start soon. They depart under peaceful circumstances.Helen confronts Klaatu in the woods and pressures him into telling the truth. She realizes that Klaatu and the Alien entity are here to save Earth, but will save it from Human Beings, not helping us. The most memorable quote from Klaatu is: ""If the Earth Dies, you die. If you die, the Earth survives"".Meanwhile in Central Park, the Military, using peaceful methods and slow movements, finally manages to place the huge Cyclops Robot in a large container.Jacob, Klaatu and Helen - pleading for a second chance for Humanity - drive to the home of Professor Barnhardt, a Nobel Prize Winner and very intelligent gentleman. As Klaatu enters, he sees a complex equation on a blackboard in the empty living-room, and starts to change it. Helen says: ""I wouldn't do that if I were you."" Klaatu responds: ""Oh, he won't mind!"" Professor Barnhardt enters and joins Klaatu to finish the difficult and previously unresolved equation. As they finish adding and erasing symbols and numbers, Barnhardt says in complete awe, looking at the final mathematical equation: ""Is it really possible?"" whereupon Klaatu simply looks at the numbers, apparently content.Barnhardt and Klaatu engage in a crucial discussion on how intelligent civilizations survive possible destruction. Klaatu starts to realize that Human Beings have some good qualities also.Approaching Military helicopters capture Helen and Klaatu and Jacob escape through the forest.Helen Benson is interrogated and held captive by the Military.In a Military facility deep in the mountains, the Cyclop Robot is observed and studied. Finally it starts breaking down into millions and billions of tiny insect-like nano creatures that rapidly begin to eat all the materials produced by Man, including the holding facility itself. Every Human is quickly killed by this rapidly expanding 'nano cloud' which feeds and reproduces using the consumed material, fire. Working like a highly von Neumann Machine, it multiplies extremely fast and is completely indestructible.The Military personnel holding Helen get word of the destructive nano cloud that is starting to spread and consume everything Man made in its path, including Human Beings.Helen, Jacob and Klaatu eventually join together with Jon Hamm (Michael Granier) who is Helen's friend, a Scientist working for the Military. Jon Hamm realizes the extreme danger and threat to Humanity. Together they proceed to Central Park.Jon Hamm is killed by a Human missile aimed at the Globe. Jacob and Helen are both infested by the nano cloud that increases in size exponentially, consuming all Humans in its path and destroying all man-made structures, while leaving nature alone. The goal seems to be to destroy or 'eat' everything Humans have created, along with the Humans, thus restoring nature and letting the planet heal itself.Klaatu finally decides to try to stop the process and explains that it will come at a price. Helen urges him to go ahead, what ever the consequences, as long as Mankind gets a chance.Helen and Jacob are healed by Klaatu, the destructive Process is halted and Klaatu disappears into the Huge Globe in Central Park. As the Globe leaves, all electrical devices turn off one by one. Machines shut down, trains stop, factories stop operating, ships float around without power, cities are darkened as all lights are turned off, and even wrist watches cease to function.Mankind has been given a second chance, but the price is steep: Humans can no longer produce electricity and the entire system breaks down.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Not in the natural light of the Sun. All we hear like them, are the comments of the cave keepers - another filter of our ""education"". This movie, albeit trite and poorly timed, conveys this meaning to me.

The owners of ""information"" can bend it any way they want: our ""education"" leaves us prisoners inside our own cave (our heads) and we don't seem to have learned a thing since the 1951 edition gave us our 1st warning. Nor, since Carl Sagan raised the warning flag in his last book. If anything the human ""race"" has digressed into a pallid and hollow materialism; in a world where the vast majority live in stunning poverty, this is of no concern to the wealthy who could eliminate this condition is they so desired; we are as disconnected / alienated from our selves as ever in our history. We may have indeed already passed the so called ""tipping point"" and yet we still do not seem to be able to change! Most of us wouldn't even want to change! We seem hell bent on spoiling our nest like no other species is capable of doing, rushing headlong into mutual destruction like the Gadarene Swine. We can't do the math and don't remember History. I wonder what people living sixty years from now would think of this movie: what would they think of it with respect to the 1951 version? Will we even be here in sixty years to think about it? Yes, there were many scientifically implausible tenets presented: ""there are a limited number of planets capable of supporting life""?!? Out of billions of solar systems in our rather pedestrian and average galaxy - with billions of galaxies (we know about)?!? Any civilization sufficiently advanced would come here - to kill a species that seems to be doing a fine job by itself?!? There have been several ELE's (we know about) in our planet's history: Life has been decimated time and again yet always manages to evolve with more biodiversity than before. Even if human beings destroy themselves and much of the rest of life on this planet, Life will survive. Our only hope as a species may be to escape the planet and the social chains that bind us to the wall of the cave. Begin to colonize our galaxy. Who will the keepers allow to leave? Why do we seem to need to be on the brink of the destruction of our species to perceive a need for Change?Maybe that was the message of this film...",The Day the Earth Stood Still
621,lemon-16,I was so angry at the end of this movie,2,14 December 2008,"It was Al Gore on Steroids. It certainly wasn't as entertaining as the 1950's version. Keanu Reeves was blah. In the 1951 version, Michael Rennie was at least interesting as Klaatu. As soon as Reeves says, ""Your planet?"" I think that's what he said, I got a green flash.. and I was so right. The storyline made no sense. First he wants to meet with the leaders of the world, before saying why he was here, then he just decides ""We"" humans were vermin that had to be exterminated. So if he'd already made that choice, why meet with world leaders? So you can flip them the finger before eliminating them all, just to save the world? In the original movie, Klaatu told the world leading scientists that he represented a kind of U.N. of planets and that if we didn't get a handle on our destructive nature with Nuclear Weapons, that this world would be eliminated. In this movie, no warning, no chances, just wipe us out. No real message, just that ""We"" are the problem and we must go. With their technology, Klaatu's, they could have given easily the golden key to alternative fuels. Guess he didn't have a solution to that problem either. So the destruction starts.. around the world all power, oil, and essentials for human life on earth are destroyed, when Klaatu stops it all. Leaves the earth, and leaves the human race, who number in the billions, to starve slowly because you see.. we no longer have the ability to produce that which keeps us alive. Typical environmentalist crap. Stop now what your doing and the Earth will be resuscitated. Only problem is, pre-1900's civilization was far dirtier, and far more pollution was created, than there is today. Now the earth and it's population will now have to start plowing every available piece of land to grow crops that now have to be grown without tractors or fuel. Now we'll be killing all the animals to just eat and survive. Wood and coal will be the way we heat our homes once again. OK, I see the point.. kinda. Badly written and thought out movie. Don't waist your money on this one, and don't waist one moment of your time watching it. Buy or rent the old movie. Was far more entertaining.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Subtlety is a lost art form in Hollywood these days. Instead, we are brutalized by the in your face theme of global warming and that we as a species are to stupid to live. You might enjoy this assault if your are from the chicken little-the sky is falling school of thought.

There wasn't any real FX when the Rennie/Neal version was made, so it was treated like a drama, not a shoot-em up sci-fi. It could have been on the level of Signs or War of the Worlds. As it is, it was just a bump up from a sci-fi channel made for TV movie. John Clese had a good scene, and Kathy Bates showed some chops, but I don't know what Jennifer Connlley was doing. We all know Keanu plays wooden well, but the Smith boy was good and could have handled more.

The cringe worthy performance of Jaden Smith added annoyance to the script. Obvious influence by his famous pop no doubt. Pity as the kid added nothing to the message the film is crying out to portray.The movie starts off well enough, and then tries miserably to develop the characters and make us care for them. The Bates role is truly absurd; Cleese's role has virtually nothing to say during what should be an amazing encounter. The military point of view is typical as if there's only one area where the military is useful.There were some very interesting ideas (the sphere-like ship, the nanobots, the Gort acronym) and the effects were great but the message was totally lost.Keanu was perfectly cast and Connelly does a good job with what's given to her.

The story could have been molded into a much better movie if only extra time wasn't wasted on portraying an annoying kid and a lot of unnecessary chatter devoid of any real bits of information to go with.Yes, the movie shows how humans (the top minds at least) have taken the role of the lesser beings and the fear that comes with being powerless is showed...not so well. In the worst case scenario of an alien running around a 1st world country as the world dies, I'd expect a little more effort to stop or restrain said alien. And here you are sending a cop, a couple of helicopters and that's it. Whistleblowers are welcomed with more guns.The movie doesn't give much answers and forced us to accept whatever we are shown.

633,dskuku,Rich in contemporary and relevant social criticism despite the regurgitating an apocalypse narrative,7,6 January 2009,"This film was rich in contemporary and relevant social criticism despite the regurgitating an apocalypse narrative and re-hashing Keanu Reeves as another prophetic savior. Even the ditsy, airhead Bill and Ted managed save the world. Yet, unlike most films within the apocalyptic sci-fi genre- the set of films, comics, etc. that assume humanity almost destroys itself before realizing any greater (public) good- this film's alien has no intention of destroying the earth- humanity is already well on the job! Prejudice and polarization are the greatest threats to democracy. America is highly polarized, threatening to re-order the world in its wake. This is the backdrop of this film and, critically, increasingly the evening news. Naturally, the aliens land in Manhattan. Yet rather than seeing ""the city"" focus as typical American chauvinism- it's true and exhausting that MOST Hollywood films take place in either New York or LA- this film ran the Jesus narrative to a tee! Many believe that Prophets only descend when and where there is total moral decrepitude. In fact, a devout, practicing Muslim friend from Mali once explained to me that this explains why there had been no African equivalents of Jesus or Muhammad. No better place to represent humanity's worst than where so many global narratives of hate converge: The Twin Towers and Wall Street! It is now clear that greed, anger and stupidity enabled both the construction and destruction of these such icons.The film was unrelenting in its critique of humanity's arrogance in assuming that we're alone in the universe, the presumption that the planet belongs to us, and the supposition of dominance/sub-ordinance in any and all inter-cultural encounters. This critique was maintained throughout the film, yet came to a head with plenty poignant points of dialogue: ""Do you speak for the entire human race?"" The alien Klaatu, portrayed by Reeves, asks the US Secretary of Defense Regina Jackson. She replies: ""I represent the President of the United States."" Luckily, realizing that not all viewers would see the sheer arrogance and truthfulness of this response, the director played to the peanut gallery and caste Kathy Bates in the role. She was certainly Miserable!This film was a critical commentary on cultural imperialism and chauvinism, challenging humanity to refocus on what bids us rather than divides because this allows us to reconcile despite any conflict. Exactly like the latest Harry Potter, Spiderman and Batman flics, the conflict posed in the Day the Earth Stood Still, i.e. humanity's destruction, is resolved through reconciliation- the two main characters agree to forgive themselves and one another, thereby causing Keanu Reeves/The One/Jesus, to save us. This time the Obama narrative was unmistakable. Like the little boy who thought that Keanu should have been killed, by the end, the little tanned bi-racial haired boy is the greatest advocate for tolerance and understanding in order to save us all.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

636,mlbring,True To The Original,8,24 December 2008,"Version one of The Day The Earth Stood Still was a timely and classic cautionary tale of humanity's danger to itself and others. This second version is a no less timely compliment to the original. The movie's beginning is a well conceived introduction to another encounter of a third kind. However, thanks to the fact that Steven Spielberg had no input, the contact is far less warm and fuzzy. Many reviews have complained that Klaatu Reeves is too stiff. Who were they expecting, Christopher Llyod? Don't let these hacks ruin the movie for you. Reeves does his usual best.While there are more characters in this version than the original, one additional but minor subplot, and far more special effects, this version is true to the narrative of the original. For those who demand their thrills more action packed and matrix-like, this version, like the original, will disappoint. For those who enjoy seeing the usual authorities being put their place, this movie will delight.The ending will leave you guessing. Is the cure to human nature's negative effects as simple as taking away all our toys ... and living like our forebears, without electricity? The new The Day The Earth Stood Still, isn't simply concerned with atomic weapons. Not only are the technologies which sustains our everyday lifestyle unsustainable, our politics of change are insufficient. No worry.

637,JoeWho,The Day The Earth Stood Stupid,1,13 December 2008,"Ouch! $11 times 2 wasted on IMAX. There are so many plot holes in this film I don't know where to begin. 1. A UFO is rushing towards NYC. Prediction is a cataclysmic collision. They assemble a team of scientists and rush them right to ground zero. Are you kidding? Never happen. 2, The UFO ""lands"" and the first people out are the scientists. Even ahead of the military. One walks right up to shake hands with the alien. Please! Never happen. 3.Klaatu is brought for interrogation. They bring him into a room with a lone interrogator and leave. Are you kidding? No guards in the room? Never happen. 4. The military decides to enclose GORT in giant steel panels. They built these in a matter of hours? How? Where? 5. After enclosing him, he is lowered into some underground laboratory that appears custom-made for him. Where did that come from? How did they get him there? 6. They break a diamond drill on GORT and say it will take 24 hours to fix. The boss barks ""Fix it now""!. They send in a poor schlub who promptly screws on a new drill bit. Then the sucker dies. 7. Klaatu meets with another of his kind who has lived among us for 70 years and apparently become quite fond of us. Why didn't he convince the rest of the aliens not to destroy humanity? He came to the same conclusion that Klaatu eventually reaches. 8. The ""swarm"" is destroying everything man-made in its path. We see it destroy Giants Stadium in a matter of seconds. Then it is in Central Park. Why aren't all the buildings in Manhattan falling down? Klaatu hasn't done anything to stop them up to this point. Oh--I could go on and on. Then there are all of the plot clichés; Good scientist resists evil government. Frustrated step-mom/ disconnected stepson find redemption through love of dead father/husband. Boo hoo hoo. Stupid general fires all his big guns at indestructible alien. You know what's going to happen. Yup, general gets destroyed/vaporized/eaten.

638,opperdog,Intelligent Race..???...Hardly With This Movie,1,13 December 2008,"Comment Edit....Come on everyone...even if you'd never seen the original, this is one of the worst movies ever made. Inconsistencies, confusing plot, no real story line, miscast actors, etc. Sure we all love the original, but this stinker would be a loser even if it wasn't a remake. The only reason it is tops at the box office is because of the hype and it was opened in more theaters than any movie in history. Even Fox and the producers realize they have to get every penny they can as fast as they can, because in just another day or so....NO ONE WILL BE WATCHING THIS MOVIE. Ms. Bates, Ms. Connelly, and Mr. Reeves should be ashamed of their participation in this farce that is trying to be passed off as entertainment. All I can figure is you did this film for money only with no pride of final result...that or you thought jumping on the current trend of ""let's save the earth"" movies might be of some use to the public. Director Scott Derrickson should think of another profession if this is the type product he thinks the public wants to see. And poor Jaden Smith...only 10 years old and he has to be associated with a film like this. I send this message out to the actors, director, and producers of this film...I WANT MY MONEY BACK. Trust me...this is not what the American public wants to see. Besides the fact this movie destroys the quality of and social message in the Robert Wise original...it provided no story line or message at all. One of the things history has proved is that hard economic times don't seem to affect the movie industry. The public likes movies and use them as an escape from tough times. Watching congressional bail-out debates on C-SPAN would have been more entertaining than this loser. This POS is apparently being opened in more theaters than any other film in history, and also broadcast toward Alpha Centauri. Let's hope if we do have any neighbors out there that they don't intercept this one...they'll put an interstellar quarantine around our system and the requisite ""No Signs of Intelligent Life"" message with a recommended detour to bypass our planet. I beg and implore every theater out there...do not sell tickets to anyone for this film...take it off your marquee immediately.

The story is not strong in the point that why the alien changed his mind not to get rid of human and there is no climax for me.

The remake is going to appeal to a larger audience than the critics think, because it has a message that is relevant. And although the movie has a message, it's not ""preachy"", and the message is revealed as the story evolves. I watched the original 1951 cult movie, and the new movie is far better, in every way. The characters are more fleshed out, the plot is more believable, and of course the special effects are better.

644,davidburnell,Is it a remake?,5,27 December 2008,"I went into this with an open mind, bearing in mind that Keanu Reeves did not need to be overstretched playing an alien. The film is okay at best. My main issue is the plot which is weak and confused. Given the fact this is purported to be a remake of a Sci-Fi Classic, that is inexcusable. The problem in the script is that essentially it ignores the original altogether. Aside from a couple of scenes it bears very little relation apart from character names. The variation does not improve on the original. The original, naturally spare of special effects (1951) relied far more on characterisation and atmosphere, much lacking in the 'remake'. The original also fed off the politics of the time to create an undercurrent - rich territory for the new film but apparently untapped.If you are not keen on watching 'old' films then by all means give it a try, but, bear in mind that you are watching a new film that beyond the title, gives the very slightest of nods to its far superior predecessor.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
645,tastescoop,One of the most dramatic,7,23 March 2021,"The first 25 minutes are amongst the most dramatic first acts in cinema history. I feel after this it struggled to build on the drama it had started. I just don't think a lot of the acting bought into the epicness of the plot they constructed.The primary cast play their roles well. I think Kathy bates is a little out of her depth with science fiction though. Her portrayal feel clumsy but this may be scripted.Keanu plays it well. He is good at this type of role. Acting without speaking too much is difficult to do but he pulls it off in spite of the original premise of the character.
Jennifer also does well she is believable in her role.I don't know why Jaden smith was chosen for this. He is way out of his young abilities plus he keeps looking into the camera... but I'm sure he had his reasons. I don't want to say his role brought the film down but I think his character was surplus to requirements for this film and it would have benefited from the absence.This film could have been done with an even smaller cast keeping it just to three perspectives would have amplified the drama and gave us a truly powerful statement.Ultimately I think it's reach far exceeded its grasp.Whether it should have been made at all in consideration of the original is a different debate.In parts it is very good I just think certain parts of the script should have been rewritten and castings should have been reconsidered and we could have had a real event moment.No need to be mean about it though.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
646,adrian-apodaca,Disappointing,3,15 December 2008,"As there seems to be a lot incomprehensible babble about the science fiction aspects of this movie or perhaps its accuracy to the original, I'm here to merely comment on this movie's lack of execution...as a movie.Yes, I constantly question movies' leaps of logic (why would all the scientists be at the landing site before the military cleared it for access? hmm?), but that is for another thread. Instead, I'll explain it very simply: This movie was not well written.*Spoilers below* The exposition ended up taking much too long (although I was at least interested in the movie throughout it). This ended up leaving very little, in fact, no time to properly illustrate Klaatu's motivation for his change of heart. The exchange between Klaatu and Barnhardt was stunted at best. This should have been the most important part of the movie. Instead we were left with too many scenes of horribly shot and horribly planned scenes of the GORT and Kathy Bates mailing it in.I know what I'm getting with Keanu when I see a Keanu movie, but I was expecting a lot more from Jennifer Connelly (I don't know why now that I think about it). Jaden Smith was a pit stain on the cast (someone forgot to tell him in his ""acting classes"" that simply showing attitude every scene does not make one a good actor...at least his dad finally learned that).I was fine with the message (go misanthropy!) and fine with the movie not having a ton of action. The action sequences seemed forced and extraneous even when they did show it (like some stupid studio exec expected that of all science fiction movies). It really came down to the quality of the plot execution.I'm more annoyed by the fact that I was bamboozled by the trailer. It gave the impression that this movie was going to be genuinely suspenseful and tragic. All that was found in the movie was a half-baked plot, a fizzled crescendo and absolutely no sign of any character evolution.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
647,keinewarheit,Not a masterpiece. But meaningful,7,11 December 2008,"Frankly, the film can impress me.I went to the cinema expecting nothing from this movie. I thought this must be just another SpecialFX showcase. I surprised me so much.The film began with a man discovering that glassy sphere in the trailer on the top of an icy mountain. In the next shot it left the man and just started telling us what was happening in the present day. Scientists and military people are summoned for an urgent meeting after a strange object had been detected to crash on the earth. Sounds like a very old-school sci-fi? The movie, however, contain little action and a lot of talking about this and that, all of which concerned much with human's basic instincts and behaviors.The opening sequence wasn't really thrilling at all. The acting wasn't perfect. The scripts sound ridiculous at times. If it's this flawed, then why did I gave it 7/10? Keanu Reeves gave an interview indicated that Klaatu will become more 'human', he was absolutely right. Just this 'human' is a kind of human portrayed in the film.Yes, i praised the quality of special effect. From the beginning those scenes were real eye-candy. In my opinion, casting Reeves as Klaatu was a right decision. He has successfully portrayed something 'alien' to us. Did you thought that a boy and many character in the film should be killed? If you did, then the movie have completely fulfilled its purpose: to teach you what human being really is. I didn't understand this until the movie ended and let me having some time with myself. According to the film, Klaatu learned that human race loves violence. And, without any bias, yes, we are. Seeing men fighting for a ticket in the train station, a higher-rank left his crew died just to be safe, and a representative of US government (one good performance from Kathy Bates) acting like she rules the world was, for me, reminded me how cruel people treated each others.It you pay fully attention to the dialogue, you'll see that there's more that just a heavily CG-ed sci-fi.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

649,letrec-1,watch it to say you haven't,4,3 February 2009,"The original 'Day the Earth Stood Still' was a classic of the sci-fi genre, and accomplished this feat largely by sticking to the elements of science fiction _writing_ which make such films distinct. This alleged 'remake' of 'The Day...' ignores the elements of suspense, banality, and underlying tensions which made the original both a pleasure to watch and a film which provides a unique social commentary.The rather comical recasting has left the film hokey, empty, flashy -- and nearly unrecognizable. Glitzy MTV montages of electrical communication and flashy effects a la 'The Matrix' left 'The Day...' more as a Matrix cop of and hybrid and nearly unrecognizable as a remake. (The first 20 minutes which highlight the birth/escape of Klatuu are added as prequel-like additions to the plot, but were honestly little more than an excuse to make use of special effects and highlight the very stereotypical 'alienness' of the Other.)I was anxiously awaiting this release and have now been sorely disappointed -- if you have nothing else to do, watch it to say you haven't.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

651,rblahynka,One of the most widely misunderstood movies I've seen,10,22 April 2021,"First of all, any comparison to the original movie is almost pointless and is basically the main reason of the bad rap. The fact that this idea-driven movie has worse rating on IMDB than the god-awful movie 2012 is mind-blowing for me. This movie is a different look at the original one's central premise. It's not trying to cancel the original, so I don't understand why the original's fans feel the need to put it down. I believe it does a better job with the concept than the original did. If you're willing to actually watch it and try to read its messages, all the information is there, even though many people say it's ""incoherent"". And it baffles me how people can applaud a 70 year old movie and not be bothered by the (by today's standards) laughable effects, and then fault this new movie for it's CGI effects which may not be as perfect as they could have been! Talk about a double standard. The new rendition simply is at least on par with the original, and in my eyes, much better. !Minor spoilers, not more than is in the trailer! While the original revolves around space-faring aliens who are afraid of human atomic bombs and a woman who essentially charms their envoy and introduces him to some scientists to stop the doomsday, the reimagining instead uses the theme of ecological devastation and the alien's pragmatic decision to stop it. Seems to me like a much more ""evolved"", less period-centered and therefore better aging plot than the original. The doctor merely happens to be a woman (as in the original), but there is no attempt to make her interaction with the alien into something as basic as ""interstellar romance"". So many people seem to suggest this and I wonder if they've seen a completely different movie from the one I did. (Mind you, the original movie's poster contained a damsel in a corset(!) being grabbed by huge robot hands. How ridiculous is that?) Then there's people hating on Reeves's ""wooden"" performance, as if it weren't completely in character of an alien who doesn't really understand emotion and is stuck in a human body. And hating on the bratty kid - as if it wasn't the whole point of the character, who was simply supposed to get on your nerves (as he did on his stepmother's).",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Don't blame me for that, I'm not into scifi and after viewing this film, I will never be.

Jaden Smith was such a brat that you just wanted to smack him on the head, which is exactly what a kid like him should be like. The American government portrayed by Kathy Bates was so cold you get frustrated, but isn't that what the government was like before the new president to come? (Which also reminds me that, doesn't the movie sort of bring up Obama and Bush? Bush being the bellicose ""world leader"" and Obama, being brought up by a white woman?

Granted, I just saw it last night at the dollar theater, so I had heard all the negative reviews, and thought it may be worth a shot. Overall, the style of the film was very beautiful, and the plot seems pretty timely, especially if you're interested in environmental possibilities of the future. The idea of aliens coming to the planet to decide the fate of humanity has been filmed before, and will be filmed again, but TDTESS does a great job of opening up a discussion about those possibilities, as well as the role of technology in society. Also, I have to say, I've always been a big fan of Reeves and Connolly.

667,billstrowder2003-1,A Film Noire commentary on ecological stewardship shot in color.,5,2 December 2009,"""THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL"" (2008) had a noble message, but it didn't have characters or construction to make the audience connection with the average movie goer. Though I personally found enough decent elements in this film to consider it ""entertaining,"" only the most eccentric intellectual would see it twice at the box office. It was a color film, but its cinematography was essentially ""film noire"" and I can see why so many English-speaking bloggers posted negative reviews.The biggest turn-off for the average person was probably its pig-headed, stubborn, violent characterization of people in authority and of humanity in general. If the message of this movie was about change from those hostile, defensive tendencies, the characters failed to graphically demonstrate it.I would hope that some of our leaders would have enough logic to conclude that hostile greetings to entities capable of interstellar travel would be futile at best and suicidal at worst. Even if that's not true, most of us watch movies for an escape from reality and for inspiration to improve reality. We like to see humanity or at least one human rise above our failings, do right in the face of wrong and inspire us with heroic human character and action. The problem with this movie is that it becomes mired in its own pessimism and misses and opportunity to inspire us on an issue and in a time that we truly need heroic inspiration.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

670,emandalakerfan-1,my movie was remade and...,4,12 December 2008,"(some spoilers) it was interesting. Now first of all let me point out how important the classic is, I'm only 17 and i've seen it 8 times and enjoy it every single time. Its a classic because future generations will watch it again and again. Its one of the best movies ever made top ten in my opinion, that said it makes sense Hollywood would want to remake this right?Not in this case, i saw my classic loved movie get a whole new turn around in a bad direction. As the movie started i was actually hooked, i was putting myself in that position like ""holy crap thats a flying globe in the air run away"". But once Keanu was introduced i was lost so much hope for this movie. Here i thought a perfect emotionless role for him its perfect how could he end up ruining it, well he did. I honestly don't know how he has an acting career. It was that bad. Now my second problem is Gort, OMG one thing directors of horror remakes tend to do is to make the killer like 7 feet taller. take halloween(2007) michael myers is not going to be more intimidating if he's the size of shaq, he still scares me no need for extra height. Gort is practically the size of a huge skyscraper. Thats not necessary. Now for the most part this movie has the same premise, klatuu comes to ""help"" this time and he doesn't leave telling us if we don't stop the fighting he'll come back, in this version he says screw it your killing earth so i'm not going to hesitate and kill you. By the way if you don't know yet this is an environmental ""lets be green"" movie. and it wants to make you feel like crap by saying your the main reason why the earth is dying shame on you. and then you have a decent performance by Jennifer Connelly except every time she says ""give us a second chance, we can change."" OMG she repeats this line so much it gets annoying. Her only downfall from acting in this movie. Overall she was great.Now two performance i was disappointed with, first Kathy bates, sad day for her. She was the only one who seemed to try and save this movie but still not enough. Second Jaden Smith, i loved him in pursuit of happiness. Amazing performance but here he falls flat. It was pretty bad, its like the producer said lets put some ethnic people in this movie. Maybe if Will smith was klatuu then Jaden could soar. There was one good scene for jaden when he takes klatuu to his dad's grave and asks him to revive him and he says no. That was a good scene until Jennifer comes in and hugs jaden. I'm guessing there was no chemistry between the too.quick side notes why are most movies now product placements? klatuu in McDonalds?? come onNow if you've seen the trailer you can see that a truck and stadium vaporize. any guesses to what that is?? Its gort as tiny little bugs flying all over causing destruction Now Jennifer asks klatuu ""can you stop it?"" ""i'll try""? What just try? why does he hesitate? by this point he has seen humans can love and blah blah blah you get the idea Not once does he say the magic words ""klaatu barada nikto"" i was waiting so much for that but never happened. I tried to like this movie so much but it never happened. the ending was awful and klatuu never made a final statement like in the original. Yes save the earth important message but the way this movie tries to send it is awful.

672,toroto92,The Day the Earth Stood Still and so did I.,2,28 February 2009,"This comment will contain a few spoilers. First off, lets start with what this movie is about. It's a remake from the famous and fantastic film that was made in 1951. Does the remake live up to the original? Not a chance! This movie had me wondering what I was even watching and the main problem is a poor written script and terrible acting. Though the thing that got to me most was the horrid plot holes. I don't think I've experienced that many silly and stupid plot holes in a movie ever. Lets mention a few.The beginning of the movie, when we see Klaatu or whoever he was at the beginning first seeing the sphere. What was the point of that? Why show us something that makes no sense at all without giving us some information.The scientists. Helen studies fossils or something, so why is SHE so important to have if an asteroid is heading towards earth. I didn't get why she was so important? When they first have contact the alien/Klatuu at the time reaches out his hand. This is a sign of peace. In this movie the military just gun him down like they always do, cliché.Klatuu then gets rushed to a hospital or something and we see him being born into a human. After some minutes the Secretary of Defence walks in. She wants to ask him some questions and boy they are stupid. As the Americans already know, is that the aliens have a hell lot more power than them, though that doesn't seem to stop miss ""America rocks the entire world with weapons and bombs"". Her character is so flat and so dumb that even a five year old kid wouldn't be convinced.It appears in this film that America is the world? I hate watching movies where every other single country is just some trash, and America is the ruler of the world? Why is this?. And of course, the only thing America can answer with is a war crazy general that just wants to bomb and do damage to the alien sphere. Cliché.Klatuu tells Helen why they are here. Exterminating the human race because they are ruining earth. Alright, good point indeed. Though love saved the day one more time. Because Klatuu got convinced by Jennifer Connely's bad acting so fast that it didn't make sense at all.Though the biggest tragic in the whole movie is the spoiled little kid. Why is he there? What is his purpose? I got so annoyed in every scene that kid was. And the way it was planned just tells another thing about this garbage of a script.All in all the acting was pretty horrid. None of the characters were believable and did not have a connection to anyone. Reeve's almost looked like a lifeless robot. But the biggest mistake was Kathy Bates. Why did you do this movie? You did not fit in the role at all, and it made the entire movie look cheesy as hell.All in all this movie was horrid. So many plot holes and bad script writing that you could take a bath in it. If you add the bad acting and over-dramatic visual effects you can't even imagine how bad this is to the original.

674,bebopgroove2008,"Amazing, Awe-Inspiring, Deep, and Intelligent",8,14 December 2008,"I hadn't known about TDTESS that long, maybe only a couple months. I was somewhat curious about it because I had heard of the original 50s one (I mean, who hasn't?). A few weeks ago I began seeing TV ads for it, which were the first clips of the film I had seen yet, and got a little excited, because there was something about it that seemed awesome.The beginning confused me a bit at first, but I eventually figured it out the next morning. Things got a little bit more interesting and exciting as the story continued on after that, with the impending ""encounter"". Something about it seemed real, with the panic and confusion in the first part of the film. And then Klaatu makes his first appearance. I absolutely loved when a shot is fired and hits him, and the giant ""thing"" (for lack of a better word) reacts and tries to protect him (which Klaatu later explains, it was protecting him and only reacts in the presence of violence). Another great part of the film happens soon after, when he has his full human form, and the female protagonist and other scientists are gathered around him in some ""recovery room"", while the woman representing the president interrogates him with questions. You can definitely feel the alien's initial fear and awkwardness in the scene (I mean, who wouldn't be afraid if you were on another planet being surrounded by aliens while they poked and prodded you). I love the line later on when the female protagonist asks him, ""What were you before?"", and Klaatu replies ""It would only frighten you"". It's just wonderful lines like this that make the film a real treat.Reeves certainly has an otherworldly presence in the film. I would almost say he has a ""dark"" aspect to his character. He shows virtually no emotion, and not one smile. That's not to say he's a robot on screen; he's anything but. But it's a wonderful transgression to see him eventually care about the female protagonist and her son. I also found his ""abilities"" to be particularly awesome, as he seems to just do things with his mind. I think this has something to do with the fact he ""looks"" human; it's that fact alone you connect to him more. If he looked like some sort of monster, it just wouldn't work. All in all, he's just wonderful to watch in the film.One thing that is stated in the film is the destructive and violent nature of the human race, and it's 100% true. Maybe some people can't handle hearing that, as I came across some thread titles along the lines of ""environmentalist rubbish"" and such. This is the only home we have, and if we start killing off more species and slowly ruining the delicate balance called ""nature"" (animal and plant life in nature are like kegs in a clockwork; without the kegs, the clock ceases to function), or adding more toxic crap to the atmosphere, well then you can just say goodbye to the wonderful planet called Earth.I guess it seems like this film struck something in me. There was just something amazing, awe-inspiring, deep, and intelligent about it. It's such a shame that today's audience can only accept the garbage that is immature, grossly perverted, and filled with mindless action and gore (gore can be an exception in some movies, but in most it only serves as a ""teen magnet""). A film like this is a priceless rarity.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Having nothing to base this on, I find it creative, unexpected and the cinematography was superb. CGI creatives were convincing. A nice refreshing storyline that gives reason to what is happening, how and why it is happening. In my opinion, I find it to accurately portray how things may unfold in a real life scenario of events.Keanu is perfect for his role in this movie. As is Jennifer Connelly. My only gripe would be the kid. But more or less him as a character, not his acting.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
676,antarpreet-singh,Wasn't that bad ...,8,13 March 2009,"I hadn't seen the original so the plot was kinda 'fresh' for me . The starting minutes really gets you into the feel of the movie . The welcome of klaatu in an extreme humanly fashion , and klaatu's reaction to it seems justified to the plot . The character of klaatu as played by Keanu is of a being having no particular love for the human race . He's concerned with the life sustainability of the earth for which he's prepared to wipe out the entire human race .Now the way klaatu changes his mind seems a bit insufficient for that intelligent a being , but its not entirely unbelievable either . Overall the movie was above average , but being a fan of movies in this genre i would've liked it anyway .",The Day the Earth Stood Still
677,onikez,Well thought of - It is a Wake-Up call!,9,13 December 2008,"I almost believed the numerous reviews that criticized it.I've watched Alien(s) series of sci-fi movies and this one I feel is much more meaningful.Keanu Reeves has done a great job, and also the other actors! Visual effects are stunning, and the movie comes with a good message.It is a must see for all sci-fi buffs who are also deep thinkers.Giving 9 as I went in with very very low expectations and came out very impressed with the cinematography and delivery.At times I felt a few dialogs were week - but must give that much leeway. I also felt that the ending could've been better.However it is worth the idea presented - although a little unconventional. Think beyond the movie - see the message - is it not relevant in the current times?The scenes of violence or bad behaviour against Klaatu or Gort are symbolic of our natural reactions that've led us to a world that is fighting with each other.At least it has been very inteeligent to reflect our limitations of expecting an alien in a form that we expect - as Keanu asnwers when asked that he was in a form different than human, and had taken it up for the sake of humans - to communicate.It does depict the aliens from a race that is more evolved based on peace, and technology. After II WW, we are always fearing that there could be a WW III based on the way the international reations are - this movie is really appropriate at such times, questioning are we really evolving?This movie deserves awards and wins in film festivals for the idea presented. Probably it is a wake up call! Do we really need aliens to tell us all that - may be the movie should be enough for that.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
678,jobvida,Horrible Movie,1,5 February 2009,"The movie stunk bad all along - from the point the scientists are taken to the impact zone to the time when the last sphere leaves the earth. Plainly horrible. Added to that, I felt the moving rushed to the end. The most irritating aspect is the concept of lone women changing the mind of an entire alien race. When you think that is bad, there is a kid tagging along increasing the level of irritation. And then there is an alien and a nobel prize retard exchanging some very quick math. What do people think while conjuring up base less stuff like this one? Back in 1950s, when people were very new to SCIFI stuff, this would have been a great story. But not these days. I haven't seen the old movie but I think the director plainly copied the story without ensuring it meets the present day standards. Rushing to the end, leaving tons of logical loop holes in the story, very random action scenes - all are quintessential to very early movies. That's what you get to see in this one.The one and only one thing I liked is Keanu Reeves but am disappointed he accepted this.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
679,ScarecrowsBrain,What Happened to Gort?,1,10 December 2008,"The Day the Earth Stood Still is an utterly pointless movie remake. The original - and I'll pause here for everyone who's never seen it to roll their eyes - is one of the best sci-fi films of all times. This modern telling keeps only the names of the characters and abandons everything else.In this version the trouble starts early on. Alien visitors arrive on earth (in an improbably crowded Central Park at night) but we don't see the landing of their vessel. Instead we get lots of dramatic mist and scientist types in haz-mat gear looking lost. Keanu/Klaatu emerges from a pretty orb, greets the pretty microbiologist, then gets shot.Cue Gort, the indestructible robot guardian of peace. In what should have been the most dramatic part of the film ends up being its biggest disappointment. Gort, a textbook example of budget CGI filmaking, appears and makes a loud noise that frightens police dogs. And just when he seems poised to open a can of whip-ass, he gets silenced by Keanu/Klaatu who is coiled up in a fetal position on the pretty microbiologist's lap.The rest of the movie plays like a throwaway Spielberg vehicle with a cute kid, lots of cheap sentiment, an alien who eventually goes home and the never-ending message that Love Will Save The Day.Listen folks, save your money and seek out the 1951 version, filmed in beautiful black & white. The soundtrack alone is worth the price of a rental and when you see it, you can join the legions of fans who's eyes glaze over when they hear those three immortal words: klaatu barada nicto.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
680,jasd911,There's More To It Than Meets The Eye...,7,11 December 2008,"I've JUST seen this film - I think that with audiences and critics alike, it will not accomplish much. However, since the original: ideologies, meanings and the interpretation of life as we know it have dramatically changed; and the remake shows this to us. The biggest and most vital change to the narrative is that (due to the constant mediated stories regarding pollution and human made global warming) now the EARTH is what needs saving from the HUMANS and this is what is key to the movie. It's showing to us (through stunning CGI's, visual effects and admittedly slightly corny acting) that we are destroying the planet and that something dramatic DOES need to happen for us to do anything about it. Many of you will no doubt feel maybe patronised and/or frustrated by the idea that the director has sort of thrown his environmental beliefs and concerns down our throats (similarly to Shyamalan's ""The Happening"" - which certainly was dreadful). But I think you have to really think about what the film is TRYING to achieve - and thats to give us a sense of realisation about ourselves and the actions we take (environmentally in this case). Due to it's inventiveness and subtlety in the point its making, I think its fair to give it a 7. Plus, all this aside, the action was awesome, as was the tension! A good effort at trying to mold a cult classic.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Seeing our society through the eyes of someone who is so new to everything is always fascinating, and I thought this movie did a great job of showing us what America looks like through the eyes of the extra terrestrial being Klatu (sp?), and definitely caused me to reflect a lot on our society and its norms. Sorry for being so vague, but I don't want to include spoilers.That said, like every Hollywood movie, the makers of this film bit off more than they could chew - because just like in every Hollywood movie, they introduced so much complex and vivid story only to wrap it all up in the blink of an eye, leaving so much undeveloped. I think this is just the effect of the Hollywood formula, which I call the ""cram in as much as we can in as little time"" method. Hollywood movies like this one tend to try to tell so much story in so little time, the effect of which is the feeling that the film is very ""scatter brained."" I do recommend seeing this movie though, because there's a lot of value in the introspection it provokes.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

It was beyond my time, about 30+ years before I was born.Movie was loads fun. Don't listen to the nerd rage going on here, movie was enjoyable and engaging. Although I admit that there were tons of plot holes I didn't quiet get, like sending the world's best scientists on a suicide mission on a helicopter right above the crash site... not gonna happen. Nevertheless, the story was engaging.Anyways, what really got me thinking after the movie was our current crisis... our world IS dying.

The warning signs were there when the cinema was virtually empty for an evening preview screening and it soon became apparent why, the plot is weak and flawed and there just isn't enough drama and intrigue to keep you that interested. Considering the storyline the film isn't 'big' enough, for example a giant sphere from outer space warrants only a few cop cars and tanks instead of an army with thousands watching. I found myself wanting the film to end and when I spoke to others this seemed to be the general consensus, indeed no-one I spoke to seemed to have been impressed by it at all so overall a bit of a let down.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Sadly though, Keanu stays true to his rigid, un-emotive self in very close form to The Matrix but this time without the cool factor.

686,shadownight,GREAT remake of an old classic,10,17 December 2008,"I think people are missing the message within this film, saying it has none, it's an insult to the original, but they're all wrong. BOTH movies have a great message, and both are true. In the original version Klaatu comes to Earth to warn humanity of its violent nature and that they need to change. It seems to me that those who have reviewed this movie and said it has no message whatsoever obviously weren't watching the movie but more so looking for reasons to hate it. First off, with any remake or adaptation you shouldn't compare it to the original, it'll make you hate it. Like with the Spiderman movies, so many people hated those simply because it wasn't like the comics. Hello? NONE of the comic book movies are that close to the comics! In any case, the reason why they changed the movie's message for this version is because of the time we're living in. Yes it's obvious we're still a very violent race, but this version is expressing the message which the majority of humanity has STILL been ignoring! GLOBAL WARMING!!!! It's why in this version the aliens have a weapon which destroys humanity and any of their creations while the other races of Earth remain protected in an orb which acts like an ark. Oh well, guess people are going to ignore it still until it's too late. But as the professor said in this movie, humanity will change once it's at the brink of destruction.To finish off, this is a great movie, especially if you give it a chance. I don't suggest watching the original before seeing this movie. Reason goes the same as trying to read the Lord of the Rings books before watching the movies. They're so different you should just forget about the original and ENJOY the new one. Just because you enjoy or love one, doesn't mean you have to hate the other.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

It keeps you entertained, but with a message involved. From what I hear, the original keeps a message to the movie as well. I've seen a lot of movies and this was not as bad as people are making it out to be. People have to understand that the 1950's version was made 50 years ago. Come on people. Hollywood is running out of ideas. Therefore they decided to remake this movie with better special effects. Is that so bad? You have to look at a movie in the eyes of people today, not back in the 50s. All I'm saying is give this movie a chance and stop bashing on it so much. To be honest, after seeing this movie, I'm curious to see what the original was like.In conclusion, to all the 1950s version lovers, this movie will make people wanna see the original.

No Extras worth mentioning; the only special was a commented version of the film but no ""making of"", trailer or interviews with actors or directors. I would have expected a minimum of 30 minutes of extra material. As it looks Fox wants to move viewers to BluRay instead of DVD. The film is nice but the lack of any additional material was a real letdown. Performance by Keanu Reeves was good although the story was a bit confusing. I especially did not appreciate the concept of the moving cloud of artificial insects. During the cloud situation the logic behind ""how long does it take to grow through a pane of glass"" vs. the time of destroying a complete football stadium is completely off.

Believe me, I had high hopes for the first fifteen minutes, then a big robot came out and I gave up. They didn't handle the movie with respect and it showed.Reeve's acting was wooden and forgettable. He is good looking, but lack with charisma. I couldn't take anything seriously about him, he is not a spectacular actor. Other cast members done their parts with decent quality, nothing special.The special effects were quite good, but overdone in some parts. Too much money was spent in this area and the storyline became neglected. Overall, The Day The Earth Stood Still is a bad movie, but still watchable.

Drawn to watching this film from the staggeringly cool adverts and the lack of anything else to watch at that time, I sat down and readied myself for what I thought would be an impressive hour or so of smooth one-liners from Matrix-star Keanu Reeves and breath-taking CGI scenes. Instead, I was pummelled with disappointment after frustrating disappointment. When we are allowed our first glimpse of a 30ft buff mechano-man from outer space, I suppose in a way it was impressive, but in a world of films like ""Transformers"" and ""Beowolf"" there is nothing here that we haven't seen before but done a lot better. And at about 30 minutes into the film, I have yet to get rid myself of the thought that it just wasn't worth the effort. Keanu is born into the movie in what looks like the snotty remains of a carcass, and the image of him, all naked and sticky on the table, is burned into our yet to be properly entertained minds. The instant dislike of the woman representing the president is predictable and gives away pretty much most of the storyline within minute. You know that the trigger-happy government will make all the mistakes and completely misunderstand the aliens.My problem with this is not the story line, because in all fairness, it was GOOD. There is a really good message behind it, and it's being delivered at a time when it's important to us all, what with Global Warming and all that. My problem is that it was all delivered badly. The script is full of irritating plot holes and nobody seems to be trying very hard to force any emotions out of their plain little faces. Thus, the characters are left as mere parts of the flat screen, instead of people we care about and relate to. Also, is it just me or are we all starting to get fed up of inevitable family relationships? Step-mother (Kathy Bates) and step-son (Jaden Smith) try to make it all work out after father/husband died and within seconds of understanding their ""difficult situation"" we know how it will all turn out. The few shots that are vaguely attractive are cut too short and book-ended by common and unoriginal ones. To sum up, there was nothing that stood out to me about this film. The music was feeble, the acting was poor and the CGI would be lucky to be classed as average. I was not the only one to sprint out of the cinema as soon as the expected fade to black arrives, one woman put her coat on just minute before hand, knowing the end was near and soon she would be free.

If an audience hadn't seen the original, they wouldn't exactly know why Klaatu was on earth. It didn't follow the exact storyline, but it was definitely inspired by it.

I've been waiting a long time for someone to update this classic sci-fi movie, which, arguably, is the best of the genre. I dint have any objection to the casting of Reeves in the role of Klaatu. I think he did well in the role. My main problem with the film is that it failed to live up to it's potential. Unlike the original there was no speech in which Klaatu made the purpose of his visit known. That fact makes the entire remake pointless. What good is the message if only a handful of people hear it? Another great disappointment was GORT, or I should say the lack there of! Granted the effects were excellent! But GORT was under used and was never the world destroying sword of Damocles as he was in the OG.

Beginning sequence disjointed and confusing! More holes in this story than swiss cheese! What did the opening sequence have to do with the story? Klaatu walks out of the ""Globe"" (where is the ship???) and just as the good Dr. is about to shake hands with him, he is promptly shot! He wasn't reaching for anything but a handshake the universal sign of 'hello'.Klaatu is taken to makeshift hospital where we learn that he was walking in a 'placenta' suit one minute and then the next minute they are marveling about how he was 'just born'. ??? Later in the film he uses some of this 'placenta'material to bring back to life a cop he just KILLED. It grossed me out when he stuck his finger in the 'planceta' and then in the dead cop's mouth! Why did he bring the cop back, if he was on a mission to kill the entire human race? Later we learned that the Globes were all over the planet, and they were the 'ARK' that was saving stuff to be used after the world was 'cleansed'. (They actually used the word CLEANSED in this context) Acting: Then there is the ACTING, (If you can call it that) The acting was DEPLORABLE! Probably the worse I have seen in any movie in the last 10 years! Kathy Bates as Sec of Defense SILLY, OVER THE TOP, NOT BELIEVABLE. ( I kept looking for her to break somebody's ankles)""The One"" as Klaatu was just plain PITIFUL and PAINFUL to watch! He sleep walks thru almost the entire film. (Oh wait that is what Reeves calls 'acting') Jennifer Connelly was terrible also. She was not believable as a Scientist nor as a mother! She never connected with Reeves or Jaden Smith on any level! (It may not have been her fault, I don't envy what she had to work with!!!) Jaden, the Smith kid, What in the world made them think this kid could act! I looked for the credits to see if they were the producers on this film! I didn't see their name! How did this kid get the part! It didn't help that the part they wrote for him was as a spoiled brat who needed his butt.. (I wish I would call an adult who is now my mother by her first name.)

701,bluess-1,Not in the same Universe as the original,4,12 December 2008,"Probably the biggest letdown of my sci-fi viewing life. Even worse than the 3rd ""Alien"" movie. So many bad points that I can't remember them all. I'll touch on the lowlights.First, as the unidentified object approached earth, everyone seemed dumb on the reason for the change in direction. Duh uh, like wouldn't a spacecraft immediately come to mind as a possibility?? Then the excitement and anticipation of a visible ship was taken away by clouds and fog and a vague vessel.As stated elsewhere, the initial contact in the park was ended with Klatu getting shot for an offered handshake (no mysterious equipment popping open). And several times in the movie, there were vehicles, equipment and/or people more evenly spaced out (in large areas) than a marching band.Rather than go over a scene by scene critique, the following complaints come to mind. 1)bad writing; all actors had trite and often repetitive lines. 2)The Secretary of State was scary, illogical, and didn't seem to be in much contact with the bosses(the President and VP). 3)Poor or no acting by the ""Stars"" and the kid. 4) choppy flow, frequently too slow or unclear. Weak continuity, scenes seemed to be just stuck together. 5) Gort was pathetic. Like the recent ""Hulks"", unconvincing CG and too big to realistically show it in contact with humans. (should have gotten Shaq for the part).... 6) No actor to actor chemistry ever formed. 7) The final scenes completely missed out on the dramas of the ""standing still"" time and the alien departure. What message did he leave us with? Since I'm a poor typist and can't immediately recall all of my issues with the film, I'll end my comments by saying that I have no problem with changing a remake so that it is more up to date and offers some different twists to add interest.

I saw it with a friend and he was under the same assumption. keanu Reeves was surprisingly believable as Klaatu but then again, I am a Reeves fan. Being ""old school"" the lack of having space ships/saucers was unsatisfying and the swirling orbs which took their place were uninteresting. The under-used Gort (the giant robot in the original) could have been the saving grace for this movie had it remained till the end. This movie did not have to stretch for a remarkable story line but the one the writers opted for was extremely weak. The fate of humanity hanging by the thread of a mother's love was too ""gooey"" for me. John Cleese was a nice touch to the movie and had his presence and dialog in the debate for the salvation of the human race been expanded this movie would have been much more interesting than just pleasing to look at. The story line was disappointing. The relationship between Mother and son was, at best, awkward. I know it is politically correct to have racially mixed families as role models but in this movie it seems it was added to somehow give this ""Motherhood"" theme validity. It did not. It actually detracted from the interest and made the mind wonder about this relationship instead of the movie. Why not Halley Berry as the mother? I just expected more of a great debate as to why mankind should be saved after our history on this planet. It was entertaining and I was excited waiting for this movie to finally get here.

Overall, I enjoyed the upgraded differences in the movies, it made the movie much more believable. Unfortunately the movie came up short and left the audience in speculation as compared to the first movie due to the ending. All this movie required was the ULTIMATUM speech, LIKE IN THE 1ST MOVIE, broadcasted throughout the world via the tremendous power/technology obviously possessed by the alien race in order to make this a blockbuster.

DON'T READ IF YOU WANT TO INTERPRET THE FILM FOR YOURSELF! thank you.I will start off and say that I have not seen the original version of this movie. But I really want to.This film definitely starts off great in my mind, moving things quickly and building suspense along with anticipation. However, much of the plot is left to guess work as the audience is pulled by the nose throughout most of the film only to meet with an anticlimactic end. Couple this ambiguity with minimal acting, this film is probably not worth seeing in theaters.One reason that I bothered giving it a 6/10 is for the thoughts that this film caused within me.

If you are going to do a remake, it should fairly easy to lift the script from the original movie and substitute special effects for any sort of thoughtful commentary. They even made John Clease unfunny. The last time I was this disappointed with a movie is when in Eyes Wide Shut Stanly Kubrick made a scene in which Nicole Kidman was naked. It should have been great. It was boring. He managed to suck all of the interesting bits out. In this movie it was the same. Save your money. Watch this film when it comes out on Comcast On Demand, use Picture in Picture with this movie in the smaller frame.

Its such a good movie. I was really looking forward to the remake with modern screen effects. Had told my wife to expect something awesome. Sadly, this movie flops. They had the opportunity to stick to the original plot and really go to town with Gort. Even the ending left one hanging in the air almost as if they ran out of money to end the film properly. Keanu Reeves won't be collecting anything for this movie. My advice, save your money and buy the DVD of the original. You will be less disappointed and have a truly magnificent movie to get out and watch every year. On a separate issue, if there are any directors reading this, the remake of King Kong hit the spot.

710,hoffbird,Comically unrealistic military actions spoils this film,2,15 December 2008,"The writers spoiled any element of believability right from the start by not thinking through what the government might really do when faced by an imminent threat to the world. They start off OK by quickly gathering up the most important scientific minds in the country (to protect the interests of the US government). That was a good start but then the story's believability totally fell apart when writers had the Army immediately flew those same invaluable scientists directly to ground zero as soon as an alien globe-like object crashes into Central Park. Further, they then let the scientists walk unrestricted right up to the surface of the object. In reality, the absolute last thing the government or military would have done with those scientists would have been to immediately put them in harms way. They would have instead flew them out of the impact area as quickly as possible to a secure, protected location. Unfortunately, that unbelievability goes from bad to worse as the movie progresses.The next part where the military actions were apparently totally unresearched--and unbelievable as a result--was when the story had the Army flying ""Reaper"" Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAVs) to attack the alien globe. First, the Army would not have flown the Reapers, the Air Force would have done so. Second, and worst of all, was the way they depicted the Reaper UAVs flying. They depicted those aircraft as extremely maneuverable fighter aircraft with flame-shooting afterburner jet engines. In reality, Reapers are relatively delicate turboprop aircraft with limited handling characteristics. They are essentially powered gliders designed for high altitude reconnaissance aircraft, not highly maneuverable fighter aircraft. No afterburners either, just propellers. That may make for boring visual effects but realism is important when using present day machinery in a Science Fiction movie. If they wanted to use fighter jets, then they should have used fighter jets rather than create comically unrealistic fantasy versions of Reaper aircraft.Had it not been for the incredibly unrealistic depiction of government and military actions in this film, this could have been a much, much better movie. They took one of the best classic science fiction films of all time and simply squandered their remake opportunity by not doing their homework. Hire some expert advisors for god's sake!! A little research would have gone a long way to make this movie a new classic rather than the special effects focused disaster that it is. The original version of this film will live on forever as a classic. This version, however, will be destined for obscurity shortly after it completes a short run through the video store circuit next spring.

I rented the original the night before watching this one to directly compare them. Many people have nostalgic memories of the 1951 version, but even taking into account that it was LOW BUDGET ( couldn't they have hired a few more than 2 extras to guard the saucer!!?) it was slow paced and had a lot of silly plot elements.In the 2008 movie, many elements of the original are present, which is charming, but things are presented in a more sophisticated manner.

Being fair, some of the special effects were OK but overall it was a very disappointing film, with a flimsy plot and dreadful story line.

I didn't see the 1951 version, so I can't comment on how true they stayed to the original. There were some interesting flirtations with nanotechnology, but it seems to me that that's been better done elsewhere - the Matrix springs to mind. I didn't find the kid as annoying as some, but his backstory seemed awfully contrived. He and Connelly didn't portray a family unit convincingly.

The original had ACTING, was plausible and just contained a real story that made real sense. All the special effects in the new version actually detracts from the story and the real meaning. The robot was reduced to an add-on that appeared the makers of the movie didn't really know what to do with him but felt he had to be in the movie because he was such a big part of the original.

723,EarlJules,... mission purpose ...,7,25 December 2008,"I believe the major difference between the original and this release is the mission of Klaatu. The original sent him as a referee throwing a flag and demonstrating his ability to penalize humanity, if required. This new release appeared to be the implementation of that penalty on all humanity for refusing to change its ways over the last 50 years. Evidently, the population of earth in this movie never saw the original movie, yet the scientists appeared to know who he was... many were more interested in Gort than in Klaatu, his planet, his form, his planet's location, or his ability to traverse open space between our planets. (sigh)The script summarized our inability to change for want of a catastrophic event that threatens all humanity... wherein lies the message to Klaatu and the others in his ""federation"" for humanity's inability to change for global benefit. Our earth is just small enough for one natural catastrophe to effect other regions and nations, yet big enough to not have one regional calamity create equal levels of fear and serious concern in all regions and nations of the earth. Earthquakes on the west coast hold little threat to the regions in the Gulf of Mexico... tornadoes in the American mid-west hold little threat to the northwest regions... tidal waves in the Pacific have little impact on the daily routines in Florida. So, in the long run, until a threat becomes truly global in nature, humans see no reason to change ... and at that point of global destruction, almost any change we will ""all"" agree upon would probably be too late to avoid any tragedy that the threat will eventually bring to the planet.As for John Cleese, (Professor Barnhardt), his presence and behavior demonstrated to Klaatu the ability of the human race to learn and adjust. Barnhardt did not object to Klaatu erasing his work and making changes - he was intrigued by the new approach and willing to argue with Klaatu as an equal to give humanity ""another second chance."" The logic of the argument, and the incident in the graveyard both, helped Klaatu realize that humans are more than ""carbon-based units infecting"" earth that need to be eradicated.My final observation is the concept of transferring all the major creatures to the ""ark orbs"" before ""cleansing"" the planet. So, it appears that the ""swarm"" may not be able to differentiate between human and animal species... or perhaps that fact doesn't matter when a planet is selected for ""cleansing."" I wonder what happened to them all once the orbs were ordered to leave the planet? (grin)To those who despised the character of Jacob... it is his superb acting skill that makes him that way; the more you hate him, the more you should praise his acting.Klaatu was born human upon arrival, so his inability to handle his new extremities and emotional-response capabilities are completely understandable (to me anyhow).Doc Benson disappointed me in her lack of curiosity about Klaatu, his planet, his ship, and his big robot, Gort. Evidently, she has seen the original movie.Gort disappointed on his waiting to implement his command directive until the movie was almost over... (grin) It was puzzling that if he was sent to destroy, why not as soon as the creatures were in the ""ark orbs?""Overall, I don't consider it a remake, more like an sequel of sorts.

724,rjperrin1,The Day My Brain Stood Aghast....,1,27 December 2008,"A major stink-burger of a remake. An outstanding candidate for a Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment.The short story by Harry Bates, 'Farewell to the Master' on which the original film is based, was in itself an intriguing yarn that made its own political statement. The 1951 film with Michael Rennie and Patricia Neal captured the same xenophobic feel of the original story even though the plot was changed a bit for the film.However the 2008 version was as aimless as it was unintelligent. We all understand that remakes of classics are always difficult propositions, and this effort was no exception, but when a film simply becomes a vehicle for the CGI team and the story is basically thrown out, what's left? This script had more holes in it than a wheel of Swiss cheese and stunk 10 times worse than Limburger.OK, so instead of the earth as nuclear bomb-crazed, loose cannons, warned of our impending destruction because of our potential inter-stellar aggression, we are instead told that because we are polluting/destroying the life on the planet, humans must be eliminated to preserve the rest of life on earth.Huh? Given that the space guys got here with some fairly advanced technology, I was thinking maybe they would have some solutions to the problem, wouldn't you think? Maybe they could, you know, help us out?? How does killing one form of life automatically save all the other forms of life? Ah, but I'm sorry - I was being logical. Something with which the writers of this mental puke-fest have limited or no experience.Throw in an obnoxious kid continuing to suffer from PTS due to a dead father (how this plot thread got thrown in to the film is an unfathomable mystery), a complete waste of Jennifer Connolly's and John Cleese's talents, and a 'plague of flies' that eat steel and concrete as easily as they devour humans and you've got a bucket of mind-bending drivel. Were the writers actually going for the Biblical analog of the 'plague of locusts' to pander to a potentially Christian audience? Are we talking Keanu Reeves as Moses? It sure makes me wonder ... for about 1/10 of a second, but then - who cares? What you end up with is a poorly directed hodgepodge of special F/X driven by the ultimate designed-by-a-committee script.My vote for the worst film of the year and a neck-and-neck tie with 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' for worst sci-fi movie of all time.

It is an abolishment to Robert Wise, and the people who put their work into creating the original ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" from 1951. This is a classic example when Hollywood tires to re-make a classic by simply adding CGI and special effects, ruining a masterpiece, and feeding on the brain dead audience that now and days is amused by on screen special effects.

The idea of bringing your child with you in the most risky situation was already shown to be a flop when Dakota Fanning screamed all through ""War of the Worlds"".

The government would have probably (at least in movie logic) brought all of their families with. I don't know many five year olds that undisciplined. The science was fun the effects were cool the actors did well. Was it bad writing, directing or editing. can someone come up with an original idea? Too many one dimensional characters. All of the military. Kathy Bates's character was awful. What makes Hollywood think that we are going to accept that people will do something that they know is futile because ""the president said so"". Take a step back to reality.

727,ed_ray-1,This was very good... I believe many missed several points,9,12 May 2009,"The original has always been one of my favorite movies of all time. It is true that despite it's age this icon has held up well.However, this remake of an icon, is one of the better ones I have seen in several years. They did many great updates that made it fit our present technology level, and yet stayed incredibly true to the essence of the meaning of the film. In my opinion they actually enhanced the meaning of the title ""the day the earth stood still"" Many negative comments seem to indicate that some people missed key points that had been extremely well done. E.g. confusion about the mountain top meeting of the sphere and the human Keanu. Collecting the DNA, to later create - i.e. be born ""another"" human like creature that could move through our society and communicate. This DNA derived body was the only way Klaatu could have walked off that starship and not looked like a 2009 ""plastic repeat"" of a 1951 movie.As someone said, Klaatu did not care about us. He was here to firm up a final recommendation and do a job to preserve as many species on this planet as possible. Comments like, ""it's not your planet"" and ""I'm a friend of the earth"" spoke volumes.I thought Bates did a fine job, caught between her first hand knowledge of the situation and the reality of having to do what the President said to do, even if it was stupid.Cleese was a better than expected Nobel prize genius who, could both see the situation and communicate the feeling...hey, we are in big trouble here.GORT - great acro, just like the military... but they kept the name in the movie in a clever way. Given that GORT was just a bunch of nanobots, the human like ""traditional GORT"" form was fine... since it was done for humans to understand and not freak out more than usual.What I liked best was, that this alien Klaatu did not believe in the human race, and either threw the switch, or did nothing to stop the process of removing this deadly human species, to protect all the others.But in a difficult way (for a totally alien mind), Klaatu did slowly come around to realizing that humans could evolve when faced with the ultimate situation... as the professor said. At that point he then said he did not know if he could even stop the process.Thus the ending made perfect sense. Klaatu, made the decision to permit human survival, in the only way he could. He killed (shut down) GORT (the nanos) and all other machinery on the planet... not just for hour of one day... but for all time. In my mind, ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is forever. Yes, probably billions of people will die, of starvation. No machines to farm or move crops around the globe. Less developed countries may do better than the developed since they already farm by hand.But the solution Klaatu has chosen will permit the humans to survive on an equal basis with the rest of the planet, albeit without machinery.It was good update that stayed true to the original warning that we humans can screw things up one way or the other. Whether it is nukes, or the destruction of the planet's environment.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
728,tinman856,A bad remake of a good story,1,1 January 2009,"One of the worst remakes I've ever seen. Sad, because I do like Keanu Reeves. The original story was pretty much followed until Klaatu was shot and whisked away by the army. After that, there was no story. The reason for Klaatu's visit and the message he was to deliver never came through. We saw very little of a much bigger, scarier and impressive Gort. And the young boy character has changed from a bright, inquisitive kid (Bobby in the original) to a mouthy, disrespectful brat. And remember the title? The earth ""stood still"" for only a few seconds and for no apparent reason to anyone but Klaatu. I don't mind a little artistic license, but this story was completely destroyed. Everyone who has spent money to see this deserves a refund.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

It stays true to the essential message which this remake distorts. The 1951 version had a certain humanity about it that completely gets lost in this remake. Why Hollywood can't leave well enough alone is beyond me. Keanu Reeves is a sorry substitute for Michael Rennie. I highly recommend the book to all fans of the ogiginal film classic. It's available at any bookstore. If and when the studio does a sequel, they will get it right next time.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
730,Stephen-11210,Unnecessary but not unpleasant remake,5,7 January 2009,"A strange globe from outer space lands in an American city and out steps an alien--only to be promptly shot by a trigger-happy US military even before he can intone the traditional ""take me to your leaders"".There can be only one reason Fox chose to call this movie ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"": it wanted the name recognition of a beloved science fiction classic up on the marquee to draw in a guaranteed audience of curious fans on opening day. That's my own pet theory at any rate, for I can see no other reason that title was used on a movie which otherwise bears as much resemblance to its supposed original as ""Independence Day"" does to ""Earth vs the Flying Saucers"". By that I mean while there are certainly points of resemblance (just as ID had with EVTFS) these people and the experiences they go through during the course of the movie bear little resemblance to their originals and the ones they went through. (It is noteworthy that while Edmund H. North's screenplay receive on screen credit, Harry Bates and his short story do not.)The similarities are easily summed up. The alien who arrives is named Klaatu and he is accompanied by a large robot. In time he meets up with a widow named Helen Benson who has a kid who lives with her who eventually takes Klaatu to the cemetery where his soldier father is buried. Eventually, Klaatu gets to scribble equations on a blackboard belonging to a boffin named ""Professor Barnhardt"".At that point the resemblance ends. The kid is not Helen Benson's biological son, Klaatu has powers that go way beyond getting himself out of locked rooms (even though he himself is apparently more human than in the original movie), and in this movie ""Gort"" in not the name Klaatu uses for his large companion--we never find that out as far as I can recall--but an acronym (ie ""G.O.R.T.""!) invented by the US military.For some reason he is also now the size of Godzilla! At least 40 feet high. His overwhelming size contrasts nicely with his part in the plot, which has shrunk to little more than an extended cameo, much of it confined to shooting down pesky American missiles and robotic drones trying to blast him to smithereens (for reasons the plot makes far from clear).More logical is having Klaatu land in New York instead of Washington, thereby putting him within walking distance of the United Nations. We are also provided with an explanation for why he does not suffer the same fate as H.G. Wells's invading Martians and shown that Klaatu is not the first alien on Earth.All of these changes, the trivial and the not-so-trivial, the logical and the puzzling, all pale because those made to the movie's plot and its theme. This Klaatu has come to Earth for very different reasons than his namesake did in the 1951 movie. In fact the remake's Klaatu has a philosophical point of view which essentially stands the theme of the original movie on its collective alien head! In the 1951 movie Klaatu specifically declares that what earthlings do on their own world was their own business. His overriding concern was that they not carry on their warlike ways against their alien neighbours.The remake's Klaatu shows no concern whatsoever about whether our warlike ways might threaten our alien neighbours. Instead his overriding concern is with humanity does on Earth. For in the remake what earthlings do on their own world is no longer their own business.That fundamental difference in theme and outlook drives the plots of the two movies apart. After starting out in a broadly similar fashion to the original (not counting a tacked-on opening prologue to the remake), by the time Klaatu meets up with the kid the plot of the remake has become all but unrecognisable to that of the original. It veers back a little with the Barnhardt sequence, but that has as much a tacked-on feel as the opening prologue. John Cleese is excellent as Barnhardt, but he is little than a pitstop in the road movie the remake has by then become, and like that other holdover from the original movie, G.O.R.T., his part in the plot has shrunk to vanishing.None of this is to say that the movie is dreadful or boring. Taken on its own terms the movie in fact is kind of enjoyable, with a not-untimely premise. Nor did I mind Reeves in the part. He is no Michael Rennie, but I thought he acquitted himself quite well.Unfortunately, the movie also has an unnecessary prologue, sketchy characterisation, elements from the original (especially G.O.R.T.) which look as if somebody shoehorned them in at the last minute, a plot which takes Klaatu all over the place without actually going anywhere, and an ending that while it looks spectacular manages to resolve nothing--apart from allowing Fox an opening for a sequel.The real burden, however, is that as a remake this movie will inevitably be compared with the original; and in any such comparison it simply can't compete. For while the original has its faults, some of them quite large, it also has strengths that this remake can't match, from Michael Rennie in the central role, to the electrifying opening scenes and the tension of the scenes in the park at night involving Gort, to Bernard Hermann's mesmerising musical score.In any such comparison the remake comes off looking mediocre. Enjoyable enough, but a squandered chance that should have been so much better given the source material they supposedly had to work with.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

There are holes in the physics from the get-go but again this is just a film made for entertaining us for a few hours (not answer life's questions) only and I think it did just that. Keanu was really well suited for this roll as I've always found him to be inanimate and he didn't disappoint! The drop-dead-gorgeous Jennifer Connelly (what a dish she is, sigh, I could watch her all day long :)) and the rest of the cast work well together, as a mosaic, across the film but there was nothing fantastic in the acting by anyone (I'm sure they all worked extremely hard) and that was cool because this was an entertaining movie thanks to their work.If you watched the first interpretation of this film (back when God was making his mind up about what to do next) and didn't enjoy this new one then I'm sorry that you carted so much preconceived baggage in with you. The first make of this film was nothing to write home about so don't hold it up as a comparison because it was full of post-war propaganda.All up better than average but not a top-runger.

A remake of a classic should be a tribute, perhaps updated to current events, but not a complete rewrite that barely resembles its namesake. The 1951 version may have lacked color and 21st century special effects, but the plot stood on it's own -- humans should not be permitted to screw up the rest of the universe. The 2008 remake portrays Klaatu as an alien in a human suit (flashback to Starman) sent to save the earth from the ignorant humans. Elimination of human civilization being Gort's (giant Gort, by the way) prime directive until Klaatu Reeves decides humans may just be inherently good. Unfortunately, by this time Gort is now just a swarm of silly nanobots, out of Klaatu's control. Michael Renne as Klaatu (1951) was sent as an emissary to convince humans that Earth could be part of the universal community -- if they could put aside cultural and political ego for the good of humanity as a whole. No advance spies, no hidden ships (spheres), Klaatu was the only contact necessary to send to Earth. He had a message and he delivered it in a spectacular fashion.

However, this is nothing compared to the end, and frankly the less said the better, which ironically seemed to be the director's view as well.

Although the 2008 version has a number of good things going for it, it goes far astray in terms of plot, content, logic and characters. To summarize the good: 1)Updating the aliens motivation from 'ending the threat of space-bound warlike and nuclear armed humanity' to 'saving our life giving planet Earth from humanity' seems somewhat plausible and timely. However it is never clear why such powerful aliens would go to so much trouble for our little planet when they do not seem interested in exploiting it in any way. 2) Good visual effects and photography combined with use of nano-bot swarms, cloning, noah's ark, Klatu's apparent control of analog, digital and bio electronics and systems. Bad: 1) The bratty and obnoxious kid does a 180 degree emotional/conceptual about face about Klatu in seconds for no obvious reason. This is very hard to swallow. 2) The highly civilized Klatu does not even try for a hearing before representatives of Earth before giving the annihilation order.

751,b-p-dixon,A Better Solution to an Old Problem,8,9 June 2010,"So far every review I've read has been negative about this movie. To each-his-own.This movie recreates the same problem (humanity being a threat to the world, itself, and the universe) but gives a better and more mature solution to the problem than the original film.In the 1951 film, the best solution that the writers could come up with was forcing humanity to ""behave"" under the threat of violence from a force greater than us. The 2008 version of this film gives a much more sophisticated answer: that being the beauty of the human condition and the need for a people to face the ""precipice"" in order to embrace necessary change.Although this solution may have been better served by not being so overt, it still shows the growth in our thinking. The simple fact that the first version's solution was merely a new threat of violence, while the remake's solutions was to see that the beauty of our human condition makes our existence meaningful, made the remake worthwhile.The role that Jaden Smith played was tremendously annoying. But I think that was the goal. He was the archetype for what mankind is: an annoying, untrusting, and overly-simplistic child-race. Although his sudden change into ""maturity"" was anything but smooth, he again represented the degree to how abruptly mankind would need to ""grow-up"" if we ever face similar situations.I think this movie was an amazing look into the ongoing development and maturing of mankind. It shows that even our creative side (Hollywood) has grown up since the original film. It shows that humanity doesn't need a greater threat of violence to make us mature; we merely need to look at the beauty of our human dilemma, and to draw from that strength to grow.Idealistic? Probably. But hey - that's why it's a movie.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
752,seannuzum,Bloody Awful,2,4 May 2011,"What more can I say. This movie was utterly terrible. I loved the original movie. All the classic sci-fi tricks and unique plot. But this movie was a whole different animal. Frankly, I did not go see it in theatres, and I always wanted to see it. Finally, I saw it on TV. I was anticipating another sci-fi drama with this alien warning the people of earth about some sort of disaster befalling us. I kinda saw the whole ecologist thing coming because that is the in thing right now. But, seriously, the plot was all used up years ago. The whole 'we must change before the tipping point is reached in the global warming issue' is really getting old. It was getting old when ""The Day After Tomorrow"" used it. Remakes can go two directions. They can either diverge from the original plot a lot or try too hard to make it a modernized copy of the original that it is awful. These are two reasons that most remakes are awful and this movie is no exception. It falls in the later category. The writers obviously tried too hard to use the original story, but change the cause of our doom. They also used excessive computer effects that made the movie non-believable. Not only was the writing poor, but the acting was horrible. In the original, the alien was stiff and odd, but Reeves took this too far. If I wanted to watch stiff acting and a poorly designed rip-off of another story, I would go to the local high-school play. Frankly, there is no reason that this movie made any money what-so-ever. The plot was poorly designed, the acting was terrible, and writers relied too much on special effects. I really wish that they would make more original movies, because this movie really makes me question whether or not we can remake any. I lost a lot of respect for American cinema today.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
753,deadofnight-997-525820,Jayden is the worst,5,31 May 2013,"By no means is this movie super awesome. But I bet would of been much more enjoyable if they got a decent kid actor instead of crappy acting Jayden. It was actually pretty interesting until the brat showed up. Keanu was good, Jennifer C. was good, John Cleese was good, Jayden was utterly annoying and hard to bear in this movie. I just had to flame the kid cause he really was that bad in this pretty decent movie. I think I am going to avoid anymore of Jayden's movies after watching his performance (more like lack of). Would of gave 6-7 if not for Jayden. There was a lot of really good special effects and honestly the movie has a good message which we all should follow. We should be more in tune with nature, not destroy it. Just like anyone's amazing survival story in the wilderness, have to work with mother earth, not against it.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
754,toby007,Very disappointing,4,12 December 2008,"Why do these movies feel they need to include a bratty, spoiled, overbearing kid?? The ridiculous performance of Jaden Smith added annoyance to the empty script.The movie starts off well enough, and then tries miserably to develop the characters and make us care for them. The Bates role is absurd; Cleese's role has virtually nothing to say this amazing encounter. The military point of view is typical; as if there's only one area where the military is useful (I would expect nothing less from ""Hollywood"").There were some very interesting ideas (the sphere-like ship, the nanobots, the Gort acronym) and the effects were top notch, however Gort (the one thing the movie had going for it) was on screen for less then 10 minutes.Keanu was perfectly cast and Connelly does a good job with what's given to her. All in all, another flop of a remake. This actually makes the War of the Worlds remake shine.I saw this movie in IMAX - if you're going to see it, find an IMAX theater.

The original has a decent plot, character development, believable characters, and a thoughtful ending. This remake monstrosity lacks these in abundance. I suppose this was supposed to be some sort of environmentalist argument for all of us to clean up the planet lest we seal our own doom. What happens on screen is basically an alien who shows up one day in a gas-guzzling intergalactic SUV hell bent on killing everybody. So just how much grass and small animals were crushed in Central Park when Reeves lands in his flying Hummer? Reeves' character has absolutely no interest in learning anything about humans. The kid is a hyper-active brat in need of a good spanking. Kathy Bates' character should be nominated for the Redundant Bureaucrat of the Century award. Even Gort manages to be boring. The aliens in this movie are ""do as we say, not as we do"" types. Apparently they want earthlings to go back to subsistence living while they tool around space in energy-sucking space ships. If I were around when Klaatu landed, after putting him on strong anti-depressants I would have then enrolled him in acting lessons and a sensitivity training workshop.

(I would have too) The original 1951 classic is just that, a fantastic movie. Michael Rennie would be disappointed also. The ending left me stumped. The writers failed in a very large way.

OK what else can I say this remake should just have been titled as new movie as there is so little in it that resembles the original classic. I'd say this was probably why it was a flop and is called one of the worst remakes ever.

758,Xephon_Rah,Just a complete waste,3,13 December 2008,"First off, I don't care if it's a remake or an original, any movie should be able to stand on it's own, no matter what the source. Second, I barely remember the original, but when I heard they were going to make a remake, I figured it might be a good idea, as the theme of humanity being on the verge of destroying their own planet could use an update. What I did have to endure, however, was 103 minutes of complete and utter crap.This movie does not work on any level. The message is that humanity is not worth living on a planet it doesn't appreciate and even destroys bit by bit every day. (Not so novel) Point taken, yet when a handful of humans try to show Klaatu there is another, non-destructive side to us as well, they do it... how? By showing sympathy and affection? Wait, the aliens have watched us ""for centuries"", and this part escaped them? What exactly have they been watching all those years? And didn't their agent, who's been living here for 70 years and doesn't want to go back say exactly that? And what did Klaatu do after hearing it? Right, he ordered humanity to be obliterated.Then there's Keanu Reeves. It's easy to make fun of Keanu's acting abilities, but this time around, I was genuinely surprised that he is apparently incapable of playing an alien, the thing he's supposed to do best. Apparently he thought that impersonating Leonard Nimoy's Mr. Spock would do the trick, but it doesn't, it's just terrible, and the best you could say is that it's good for a few laughs.The special effects are surprisingly ineffective and just boring. And I'm so tired about seeing yet another movie where the military launches some rockets against an alien spacecraft. Please take note: This will not work. Oh wait, here's a thought: Maybe in the world TDTESS takes place in, there are no movies, that's why the aliens don't know about human feelings, that's why the humans don't know about alien invasions.I managed to avoid The Happening, and I was glad I didn't waste my time on it after reading the reviews. Now it turns out TDTESS is just as boring and silly. Avoid at all costs.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
759,zareeba,The earth didn't stand still for me,3,1 July 2012,"Being a great fan of the original film, and having read some pretty dire reviews of this remake, I was pleasantly surprised by the impressive opening sequences. However, once Klaatu emerged from his chrysalis-like shell, it all went rapidly downhill. The premise of the original was that advanced civilisations, having become aware of the destructive power of humans, sent an emissary (Klaatu, the imposing Michael Rennie in the original) to warn us that if this destructive power threatens interplanetary peace (kept by intergalactic 'policemen' symbolised by the giant robot Gort) then said intergalactic policemen will have no option but to destroy us. The power wielded by these robots is demonstrated when Gort, instructed by Klaatu, makes the earth 'stand still' by stopping all electronic and telecommunications except those required to run emergency systems, such as hospitals. Those of us belonging to the immediate post-war generations can readily identify with the fear of nuclear weapons: the 'bomb' was a very real threat in those days. And while the original film script showed a rather naive belief in the power of scientists to prevent catastrophe (after all, who built the bomb in the first place), at least it left room for discussion.The 2008 remake plays instead on modern fears: climate change, although having this rammed down one's throat at every possible opportunity is likely to result in widespread boredom and indifference. Never mind that we cannot, as yet, determine the extent to which humans are responsible for the current trend (after all, climate change has always been a feature of our planet, and always will be); the alien civilisation(s) which have sent Klaatu to earth have decided that it's our fault, no contest, and we must Mend Our Ways. This is where a distinct lack of logic and credibility creep in. A civilisation capable of creating weapons of mass destruction and - possibly, in the future - also capable of space travel, could pose a very real threat to intergalactic peace. But why would alien civilisations give a toss if we muck up our own planet - even assuming that's possible in the first place (life on earth will go on, in some form, regardless of what we do to the planet)? And the means used to Teach Us A Lesson are, in themselves, destructive (if the nanoparticles released by Gort can destroy buildings, humans and vegetation, is that not throwing the baby out with the bathwater? In the end, the special effects, impressive as they are, can't make up for the film's lack of coherence. Whereas in the original Gort exuded real, terrifying menace (no mean feat given the creaky effects), and Klaatu comes across as sympathetic even when warning us about our destructive behaviour, in the remake Gort is simply there, doing nothing, until he (it?) dissolves into a cloud of destructive particles. Surely they didn't need Gort for that? Why bother with a giant robot? And it's difficult to have any feelings at all about Reeves's Klaatu, except the sense that he's really a crashing bore. Rather like much of the film, in fact.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

Sitting in your apartment neat Central Park and being eaten alive by metal nanobots, doesn't seem like a good way to die. And if you are dead, you aren't 'saved'. The premise that Klaatu is helping mankind is as little skewed.

How many people will be killed in wars for food? How many people will be killed in wars for the possibility of a better life?

YEP. You read right! I even had it ordered and paid for before I received it from the manufacturer.OK, that being said.I loved the remake. The only thing that could have been enhanced were some of the scenes.. 1-more dialogue and scene between Klaatu and Bernhardt, 2-more interaction between little Benson and mother, between little Benson and Klaatu... and 3-enhanced scenes of GORT, showing what he's made of, and what he can do.Other than that, it was awesome, there is no comparison to the original, completely enhanced and better suited for today's generation, with a specific message for all of us, young and old.I'm definitely going to buy it on DVD to add to my collection.

If you are a fan of the 1951 version of The Day the Earth Stood Still, pass on this one. Other than an alien ship landing on earth and a pseudo-robot named GORT, this movie has nothing else in common with the original and is only a Global Warming Infomercial.Unlike the original, the characters in this remake have no redeeming qualities. Klaatu (Keanu Reeves): Not a sympathetic character and really has no role in the film other than meandering around. He makes no real attempt to help mankind and like most Global Warming boneheads, thinks mankind has no redeeming values whatsoever and is a scourge on the planet. In the 1951 original, you sensed Klaatu's (Michael Rennie) concern for mankind and, unlike a loving parent trying to teach their children harsh life lessons, had compassion for life and avoided violence and used non-lethal acts to make a point. Helen/Jacob Benson: The two most unlikable characters of all! Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) is supposed to be some famed astrobiologist at Princeton University. However, it amazes me that she could put her shoes on. She's a narcissistic Bad Luck Schleprock (look it up) and was the second most wanted character I wanted to see get killed off.This brings us to Jacob (Jaden Smith). This kid you just want to slap and feed him to Gort. This rebellious eight-year old stepson of Helen Benson is supposed to inspire Klaatu not to wipe out the planet? If anything, this kid would put our destruction on the fast-track.GORT adds no suspense. Klaatu makes no attempt to strike fear into mankind in regards to GORT. Why he was created? What can he do? At least in the 1951 version, Gort was like Damocles Sword hanging over the planet. At least in the original you felt the fear of the characters and the panic of the world; not knowing what was happening and feeling powerless.

766,katharina-klug,much more than just sci-fi and alien invasion! socio-critical and moving,10,18 December 2008,"I'm surprised at some of the comments to say the least. I do realise that I'm the overwhelming minority by saying this but I thought the film was absolutely brilliant.The first 30 minutes were very much ""science fiction"". Danger from outer space, we have to save the earth, scientists are ""kidnapped"" to help the world, etc, etc... pretty good yet not fantastic sci-fi...Then with the ""birth"" of Klaatu the movie progresses into a somewhat socially critical film. There were some quotes which I remembered because they were so striking and I was surprised at the values that were conveyed: e.g. Klaatu demands to speak to the world leaders and asks the Secretary of Defense(?) ""Do you speak for the entire human race?"" when she replies ""I speak for the President of the United States"". I couldn't help but wonder throughout the movie: Does America speak for the human race? I think it's a highly topical issue and subtly addressed in the movie. Another scene that I couldn't forget was the description by the alien disguised as an old Chinese: ""The terrible thing is they sense which direction they are going but they are doing nothing"" (or something along those lines). Also memorable was the action around the little kid. Very in-depth character portrayal... the pain about his dead father and this being the reason for why he fights Klaatu until the showdown in the graveyard scene... and last but not least humanity trying to fight off the alien ""invaders"". Klaatu says it himself when the boy asks him whether he would fight or run away and he says ""There is nothing you can do"". Yet it was ironic to see how people think that there means of weaponry stands a chance against alien forces. Very smug indeed! I also liked the dramatical means that when the giant alien robot attacks earth he lifts up his arms in a surrendering pose. The effect this had on me was that I realised once more that the ""invaders"" are not the villains but just doing what they think is right...There are many more details worth mentioning but some specifics eluded me. All I can say is that the movie is much more than sci-fi. It's highly philosophical, moving (especially the story of the young boy) and well done. If that's what you expect from movies then I'd strongly recommend this film... even if you are not into science fiction!

768,mason1945,Its a train wreck,4,10 December 2008,"If you are a fan of the 1951 classic film which I am, you certainly wont like this 2008 version, thats for sure. 1. First big mistake director Scott Derickson ( he's only made 3 films in his entire life ) didn't use the Bernard Herrmann music. Whats so great about the original film is the score by Bernard Herrmann, composer of Citizen Kane, Vertigo, Psycho, North by Northwest, Marnie, Taxi Driver. When Gus Van Sant remade Psycho he used Herrmann's music, when Martin Scorsesse remade Cape Fear he kept Herrmanns music.Herrmann's music is ominous, rising and falling patterns for low brass to evoke a sense of doom laden, eerie menace, strangeness, hypnotic repetition, not of this world, very unsettling. The music for the 2008 version is entirely forgettable.2. Second mistake, they didn't set it in Washington like the 1951 original, you need to have a backdrop of the Capitol building, the Lincoln Memorial, the Jefferson Memorial. Alfred Hitchcock always sets his films with impressive backdrops. 39 Steps Forth Rail Bridge, Vertigo Golden Gate Bridge, North by Northwest Mount Rushmore. They set it in New York but made the film in Vancouver, and Vancouver is no New York.3. Third mistake is the script, the Director Scott Derickson is probably a 25 year old lefty liberal slacker who wants to shove his own lefty liberal political correct message down our throats in the process he wrecks the film.Scott Derrikson said he didn't want the alien saying to the world '' if you don't shape up , Gort will destroy the human race'' like in the original because Derrickson thought that was fascist. So Scott Derrikson wants to turn the robot into a social worker.EH ?Thats the whole point of the film, without that it doesn't have the menace of Gorts death ray which might punish the disobedient human race.. Then you have little insects destroying The Eiffel Tower and other world monuments. Thats not scary, thats just stupid. Who was the dopey script writer who thought that one up ?Political correctness wrecks the movie The female star has a half cast kid who looks like a little Bob Marley ( he's a brat ) So the woman went out with a black soldier but he died, This is totally irrelevant to the story, Its like a little multicultural sermon and we are being preached to, this of course slows up the pace of the movie.Kathy Bates is the Secretary of Defence, that doesn't work, thats a mans role. The President of the United States is no where to be seen, I suppose he's busy washing his hair. At the beginning of the movie there is a scene where all the scientists of the world are discussing the alien, the camera cuts to a 60 year old black woman and an Arab saying '' what are we going to tell the people, are we going to clear the streets. '' The scene doesn't work because its false, if you want a scientist it has to be a German. Thems the facts.Another example of bad dialogue , two jets set out to destroy Gort , the mission fails,the American General says '' What am I going to do now.''Nowadays, people think if you throw a lot of money and special effects at something, it will make a great movie, this is not the case. A good script and a good director makes a good movie. The 2008 version had neither.The 1951 classic was perfectly cast with Michael Rennie as the alien, Patricia Neal and Hugh Marlowe who played the greedy uptight square who wanted the diamonds. Directed by Robert Wise.In the Harry Bates short story Farewell to the Master 1940. Klaatu is the servant and the robot is the master.

Although, the plot was, for the most part, well developed along with a story that kept me interested and entertained for about 90% of the appropriate runtime for this type of movie (just over an hour an a half), this only barely made up for the nigh unbearable directing and god awful line delivery from the better part of the cast. Will Smith's son out acts the majority of the dramatis personae (with exceptions from Jennifer Connelly, John Cleese, and the ever so well type-casted Keanu Reeves). About 75% of the CGI was effective and aesthetically pleasing, which nicely covered up the, what looked to be not fully rendered 25% of it and horrible chroma keying job. The directing was forced throughout most of the film where watching it you could almost hear the director (Scott Derrickson, The Exorcism of Emily Rose and Hellraiser: Inferno) barking orders off camera to the extra's ""Stand up now, now, and now. Jump out of the way now, now, and now. Fall down now, now, and now."" There wasn't one camera shot in the movie that jumped out at me, and for some reason the film makers decided that it would be a worthwhile choice to not explain parts that desperately begged for an explanation while over annunciating points that were too obvious already, while on top of that, cramming important bits of characters' back-stories into a far too small amount of time when they could have easily taken out a good 20 minutes of useless cinematography to explain things earlier in the movie. However, there were some redeeming qualities of the movie that make it worth watching. As I said before, the acting from Keanu ""Neo"" Reeves lives up to what you have come to love and respect from a man who seems to have the energy of a log who went to an expensive acting school, which works extremely well and is very effective for this role. Jennifer Connelly was exceptionally real and impressive in this movie with her breath-of-fresh-air line delivery. Jaden Smith (Son of actor Will Smith) was incredibly believable in his role, along with John Cleese who sadly had less screen time than every no name actor that graced the screen in this film. On a down side, Kathy Bates (who I am a fan of) did a horrendous job of being the United States' Secretary of Defense. Despite that, there were some nice throwbacks to the original 1951 version that worked surprisingly well (i.e. G.O.R.T. looking like G.O.R.T.). Over all, this movie is worth watching, or at least renting at some point in your life. I give it 5 out of 10 stars.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

It is evident that movie making has not come a long way; it has gone backwards. Scripts, lines, and acting means nothing in movies today and special effects make the movies look expensive. When will movie makers quit taking the public's money and give it what it deserves.... a movie that time and heart went into.The movie shows scenes that are not relevant to anything. The beginning scene opens like there are questions that will be answered, but it is never touched upon again. The ending seems like the author couldn't think of any good reason to save the human race so he just did it anyway. The script writer obviously has never felt any emotion or does not know how to write it. The only way someone could have wrote something this bad and nonsensical is if he were an alien himself.The script looks as if it was a cut and paste job from other people's writings and work. No one can write that bad... professionally.... I hope.Watch the movie and find out for yourself, but please do not pay any money that will end up in the hands of the filmmakers as they do not deserve a cent.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
773,griffnut-92986,Will Smith's Kid ruined it for me.,1,7 January 2018,"If Klatu and his robot had come to Earth to kill Jaden Smith, i would have given this Movie 10 stars. I'll be Frank. this kid ruined the movie for me. The 1951 version is still my favorite. 2008 version has some good effects, But changing the storyline is stupid. Casting is atrocious. And I'll say it again Jaden Smith killed the Movie for me.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
774,Daywalkerk4,Gort Destruction,4,11 December 2008,"The Day the Earth Stood Still is a type of movie that made me want Gort to keep up with the destruction. Why? Because it seemed as if almost every character was oblivious to the fact that these ""aliens"" can defend themselves if you try to harm them. Shooting Klaatu the first time was understandable as in, someone was a little too trigger happy(like we've never seen that happen before). Gort(gigantic-looking robot) comes out and pretty much makes every soldier defenseless. So next day or whatever, we've got two aircrafts trying to attack as if no one learned that you really can't do anything to it.This movie really revolves around one person and that is Jennifer Connelly. She was the only one that can have a decent conversation without the need for any gadgets or injections to put on Klaatu(not really, there was James Hong and John Cleese, but that's it). It felt as if everyone else were just idiots and it's laughable that they would take Gort knowing what it can do. We had to hear about the ""theory"" of why the defense systems went down... so aliens shouldn't be allowed to defend themselves when one gets shot? There was never really an answer for the main reason why we were a threat to the Earth. From driving cars to tearing down trees, that apparently was not the answer as the change Klaatu saw was the love between a mom and a son. There was no notion given as to what humans must do if they were to be saved. Perhaps a little speech from Klaatu could at least give us the satisfaction of what he was truly looking for.Overall, this was an entertaining movie with some annoying tidbits. You could either take Jaden Smith for his purpose in the movie or you could be annoyed as hell. There was also the captivity of Gort where no one was to be able to escape and that proved to not matter at all. The ending was abrupt, but gives people something to think about if it were to happen. Go see the movie now... just don't expect too much out of it. Oh and by the way, the Wolverine and Terminator previews were awesome.",The Day the Earth Stood Still

776,butchski-82986,2 bad apples ruin a great story,2,19 March 2021,I really wanted to like this movie but Jaden Smith and Kathy Bates ruined it..Both of their performances were terrible..At least Kathy Bates has never had another role like this one.. as for Jadden Smith hopefully he will give up acting...,The Day the Earth Stood Still
777,jensleeroth,"Perhaps not a 10, but...",10,13 July 2018,"I don't understand why people dislike this movie so much. Many seems to compare it with the original, which I have never seen, but I still think each movie deserves to be judged independently either way. 
Secondly, people seem to have some problem with Jaden Smith? Sure, he might be a spoiled brat, but in the movie it makes perfect sense why he's acting the way he does towards Helen since he feels that she's not her real parent and probably wouldn't want to be around him if the circumstances were different. 
Keanu Reeves as an unemotional (at least according to human standards) alien makes perfect sense and he fits the role well. 
Sure the CGI is cheap, and it's a bit low to have product placement in big movies, but it's not like it distracted me that much. Overall the plot is good, the motives make sense and all in all it's just another satisfying Sci-Fi movie with some geopolitical and philosophical elements. 
Sure, it might not be a 10 star movie, but it surely doesn't deserve the massive hate and outrage of 1 star votes that it got here. And according to me deserves a higher average score than 5.5,",The Day the Earth Stood Still
778,psteve-24042,Boring,2,17 December 2019,"Nothing of substance here. Lots of ""noise"". Special effects just thrown together with monotonous music score and drawn out plot that overpowered actors. Actors representing scientists very unrealistic. They all looked like Hollywood actors. The 1951 version much more entertaining even though special effects were much poorer then. Too bad because there was so much potential here with original concept.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
779,LadySylvan,Just forget it's a remake and enjoy it for what it is.,7,21 December 2008,"Disclaimer: Since this is a review written by a 16-year-old girl (albeit one who has seen the original film, loved it, and plans to watch it again immediately after finishing this review), no one is really expected to take it seriously/read it at all.My theory? Tolerable remake of a classic. But if you're able to just forget everything you know about the original and just watch it for what it is, it's a pretty great movie.It's true that a lot of the original script's elements were altered or removed completely, which resulted in the absence of many memorable scenes that made the original so lovable. That does not stop the film from being an interesting, modernized take on the story. Instead of the 1950s, when America was filled with extraterrestrial fascination and fear of technological warfare (Those crazy Russians!), it's 2008, and when the government detects an unidentified foreign object speeding towards Earth, it's classified as a potentially destructive meteor, not a flying saucer scare. (Is it me, or does that sound a lot more realistic?)Of course, when Helen Benson-a microbiologist in this version-and the rest of the government's assembled team of scientists arrive at the potential impact scene, there's no destructive impact. Just a spaceship. And this would be the perfect time for me to acknowledge one of a few elements of the film that stood out for me as opposed to the original: Nontraditionalism. What we see isn't the stereotypical, flying saucer shaped U.F.O that tends to show up in most alien movies. Descending from the sky is a huge, green, glowing iridescent sphere, that while it borders on beautiful, causes the characters to wonder ""What on (or beyond) earth could that be?"" as opposed to ""ALIENS!"" It really makes one think: Why do we assume that an alien spaceship would look exactly the way the human public expects it to?Now on to the second element: Realism. Klaatu, in the original, was portrayed as almost completely human, outside of the fact that he's, well, from outer space. He looked completely human, behaved as a human, and spoke English. Am I the only one who found that a bit odd? Or was that basically the only way the public would view him as an intelligent life form? In our more modern take, Klaatu emerges from the spaceship/green orb looking somewhat human, yet somewhat extraterrestrial, and seems confused about the world he has landed on. In h is first few moments, he seems unable to speak English outside of repeating what he hears others say. Over the span of a few hours, he seems to develop into a completely human image, and the scientists examining him actually give an explanation for how this is possible. (I won't repeat it here; I wouldn't want to spoil every last second of the film that I remember) When Klaatu finally awakens, his first spoken sentence is ""This body will take some getting used to."" It may just be a fantasy story that isn't meant to be taken too seriously, but this seems a lot more reasonable than an alien who just happens to look human, wouldn't you agree? (However, they still neglected to explain exactly how he learned English so quickly. As much as that irritates me, maybe it's meant to be left a mystery.)BEST PART OF THE FILM:G.O.R.T. As one of several dozen fictional characters that I harbor an unhealthy obsession with, I must give an honorable mention to 2008's G.O.R.T, who deserves to go down as one of the most bad-ass characters in science fiction history. We all remember that classic character; the chilling, humanoid robot Gort (I believe his name was not an acronym in the original, I may be wrong) who sent shivers down my spine whenever he prepared to vaporize any human who was trying to stand in his way. ""There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth."" says Klaatu circa 1951, which gives the character an even greater aura of mystique. But let's face it. This fairly small robot may be a great threat to anyone who stands near it, but does he really seem believable as a global threat?2008's G.O.R.T (Genetically Organized Robotic Technology) comes raging out of the spaceship as soon as one of the Army units fires his weapon. He is thirty feet tall and 20 times the size of the average human being. He deflects missiles fired at him with his eyes, and seizes complete control of aircrafts that attempt to fly near him, crashing them into the ground in a violent explosion. When the government finally captures the robot and attempts to examine him, it is revealed that he is actually comprised of centillions of insect-like nanobots that can immediately eat through glass, metal, and preferably the flesh of unsuspecting humans. Let's face it, G.O.R.T was probably a much more horrifying threat to the world than Gort. It's a shame he got about 5 minutes of screen time throughout the whole movie.WORST PART OF THE FILM:Now this really did annoy me. Where on Earth (or beyond it) was ""Klaatu Barada Nikto""? I may not have many qualms about script-changing, but how could they cut out the defining line in the film that's known in almost every household to this day? Unbelievable, but thankfully it didn't ruin the film for me completely.My overall grade: 7.5/10, although watching this film right after the trailers for both Knowing and 2012 kind of caused an irrational fear of a soon-to-come Armageddon. I'll get over it, hopefully.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
780,roshanleenespais,hit and run kinda movie,1,13 December 2008,"i guess Keanu reeves never got over matrix , and so didn't many of us. i went into this film expecting a lot . You cant blame a guy for that, cause the trailers and the actors reputation was great. so what did i get. monotonous acting. some computer generated robot and really good sleep. after watching the movie i really wish those insects would have destroyed the world. that would be more fun than watching those idiots act so stupid. i wasn't for a second drawn into the movie. its like a bad dream. and i wish i had read a review before going for it. please don't make the same mistake. if you going to watch this move then please take a gun along. i got to go for 1. the only thing that caught my attention was the graphics , but that shining ball also irritated me.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
781,g-martens,I don't think they could have tried any harder to screw-up this movie.,2,1 May 2009,"All I can say is... What were they thinking? I guess I can understand them changing the premise of why Klatuu came here, but they completely and utterly destroyed my vision of GORT. It seems as if he added GORT into the movie just out of necessity because of the original. As far as I was concerned, GORT was a major character. And what's with the BUGS??? I could have done without that as well! If this was not a remake, I probably would have a better rating for it, but I would have never thought that someone could decimate a movie, that was my childhood favorite to this day, so completely and thoroughly. If you like the original, go ahead and watch this, but, just forget anything about the original. And if you saw the original, see the remake first It may be somewhat enjoyable that way.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
