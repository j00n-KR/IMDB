0,MartinHafer,"If you turn off your brain and watch, it's not so bad",5,8 July 2006,"This movie looks so 1970s and an enjoyable, but occasionally stupid film. I admit that it's kind of dumb, but somehow it still is fun to watch--a definite guilty pleasure.In the 23rd century, people live a hedonistic lifestyle and have few cares. That is until they reach age 30--at which point they are blown apart to the delight of the audience watching and applauding. The way this is done is just one of the dopey elements of the film. The government knows that some rebels have run off to a sanctuary to avoid this death and want to close up this loophole. So, to do it, they make Michael York (a ""Sandman"" whose job it is to track down 30-somethings for death) a runner and have him infiltrate the underground. Unfortunately, the runners are actually being processed for future food by a dopey brain-dead robot. When York finds this, he kills off the robot (why hadn't anyone done this before?) and seeks out a new life with Jenny Agutter. They find the dilapidated ruins of Washington, DC as well as an old Peter Ustinov. They are SHOCKED anyone could be that old and still be happy or productive, so they take him back to their domed city to let them know that killing 30-somethings really isn't a good idea.The film features some interesting special effects and I appreciated the hedonistic world, as it was highly reminiscent of the wonderful novel, BRAVE NEW WORLD. Unfortunately, it also has some dopey plot elements and a few really awful performances. The worst was a cameo by Farrah Fawcett, as she just seemed really addle-brained when she delivered her lines. Also, Peter Ustinov as the old man was an odd choice, as his character was pretty senile and annoying and seemed to be evidence for why they SHOULD kill old folks! Despite all this, it is entertaining--especially for kids and sci-fi freaks.",Logan's Run
1,bkoganbing,"Brave new world, but only for the young",7,26 June 2015,"Logan's Run details a futuristic society that has developed after an atomic war where people live in a large dome which we learn is on the eastern seaboard of the old USA. People look happy and healthy, but none of them are old. Reason being is that those over 30 are killed and in a nice elaborate ceremony called Carousel. That has to be seen to be believed. Naturally there are some that object to being killed and they run. When they do run, the government sends out people like Michael York and Richard Jordan to discourage that.The government errs big time though when they send Michael York out on a mission to pretend he's a runner in order to seek out and destroy some mythical society where escapees have gone called Sanctuary. York makes his run and when he teams up with a real runner in Jenny Agutter he makes it real and Jordan his erstwhile friend goes after the both of them.Some interesting concepts about the value of age and wisdom are dealt with her. Especially when York and Agutter meet up with Peter Ustinov who is the first old person they've ever met. Wait till you see where Ustinov has lived as a hermit in a world that seems to have healed itself from the ravages of atomic war.Jordan has an interesting performance as a true believer in the society that has evolved and there is the first notice of Farrah Fawcett the 70s it girl as one who has reached her allotted time.Logan's Run won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects and was nominated for Oscars in cinematography and art and set direction. It holds up pretty well for the new century. We may well ask the question is this the direction we are heading in.",Logan's Run
2,Leofwine_draca,"No masterpiece, but nonetheless entertaining",6,21 January 2013,"I saw LOGAN'S RUN at a young age and enjoyed it; that enjoyment continues to this day, as the movie is colourful, well paced and wide reaching. The plot, about a 'perfect' society where citizens are murdered on their 30th birthday, is good enough to inspire movies to this day (such as THE ISLAND).Let's not kid ourselves, though; this is no masterpiece. It's rather silly in places, and juvenile in others. The characters are very slim and the production is more about the visuals and sets than actual characterisation or insight. There are a lot of ideas here, and nice turns from supporting actors (the equally crazed Richard Jordan and Peter Ustinov) to keep you watching.I enjoy Michael York's work as an actor, but he has little to work with here. He starts out as a cold-blooded murderer, and yet we're asked to identify with him as the story progresses. Jenny Agutter has less to work with, if that's even possible, and seems merely to act as window dressing, wandering through the film at York's side.The visuals are great, and there are some startling sequences; the 'death machine' bit early on is particularly involving and impressive. The 'journey' structure of the narrative keeps you watching and even helps you to forget about the trivialities of the story or the deus ex machina of the climax. As I said, this is no masterpiece, but it is fun.",Logan's Run
3,SnoopyStyle,campy cheesy look of 70s sci-fi genre,6,18 January 2015,"It's 2274 and the people live in a pristine perfect hedonistic city under domes. However a computer runs everybody's lives and at 30, all are terminated in a ritual called Carousel. Sometimes people try to escape and they are called runners. Logan 5 (Michael York) and Francis 7 (Richard Jordan) are Sandmen who track down and kill runners. Jessica 6 (Jenny Agutter) is part of a group which helps runners find sanctuary. The computer commands Logan 5 to infiltrate the group outside the dome as a runner and destroy the sanctuary. They escape to the outside and find an abandoned Washington D.C. where they encounter an old man (Peter Ustinov).It's campy and cheesy spending a lot of money on a silly futuristic look that dominates the 70s sci-fi genre. The first hour is terribly dated from that era. It oscillates between cheesy fun and cheesy embarrassing. The movie certainly doesn't hold back but the logic doesn't always make sense. The movie slows down in the second half as they escape into the 'real' world. It should be accelerating in pace but it doesn't. In the end, it's an interesting genre movie of that era.",Logan's Run
4,Hitchcoc,A Little Bit of 1984,6,21 December 2016,"I've always found Michael York a little spooky. I remember him from ""Cabaret"" and Zefferelli's ""Romeo and Juliet,"" among other things. He is handsome but has an odd quality to him. In this film, he grows up in a society where people are living in a bubble. To sustain themselves, it was decided long ago that at thirty it was time for folks to die. It was also decided that there was no life outside the bubble. Logan (York) and Jenny Agutter come to realize that what appears to some to be a transition is actually an execution. They make their way to the other side, but things are not over yet. It becomes important to them to get the message back to their city to make people realize that there is a world where all could survive to old age if they were fortunate enough. What's a little hard to swallow is that a couple of renegades could wield so much power.",Logan's Run
5,mark.waltz,This is a 40 year old lost horizon where ageism is King.,8,24 February 2017,"I wish I had seen this in its entirety at the time it came out, a naive teen whose only expertise in science fiction was ""Lost in Space"". As far as futuristic voyages were concerned, all I knew in 1976 was that it was the bicentennial and that 2000 seemed several lifetimes away. Way past the age of 30 now, my life really began way past the age that they end here. I couldn't imagine having only 30 years to live my life, so the idea of a world run by adults under 30 who act more like children than children is a scary prospect indeed.It's the job of Michael York here to track down those who should have been terminated (referred to as runners), and in an ironic twist has him all of a sudden on the run himself thanks to an assignment to locate the 1200 plus who have managed to avoid capture and termination. He locates sanctuary and infiltrates his way in, falling in love with the understanding Jenny Agutter. Along the way, he encounters a young Farrah Fawcett, as well as the sweet old man (Peter Ustinov) who risks his life by accompanying York and Agutter back to the deadly underground city. What seems cruel in fact becomes an opening to theory, and in order to understand it all, you must look at it in the perspective of a film made 40 years ago. This goes way beyond the futuristic society's of "" Fahrenheit 451"" and ""Soylent Green"", and provides a glimpse into a dire future. With a huge set that looks like an art Deco mall and costumes straight out of Neverland, this is colorful and delightfully weird. In actuality, many of the supposedly under 30 characters look like they are way past 35.I look at this as a metaphor as to why society cannot infiltrate its way on the natural order of things, referred to as spiritualism back then, but with a sneer, referred to as extreme liberalism today. Some of the special effects and photography are cartoon like, and the music strangely sinister. I cannot look at this as dated, because compared to the artless and overly loud cynical doomsday films of the day, this actually has things of importance to say, unlike the ones of today which simply tell me to grab an aspirin.",Logan's Run
6,claudio_carvalho,One of the Best Sci-Fi Ever and Absolutely Ahead of Time,10,31 May 2009,"In 2274, the survivors of a war live in a great domed city sealed from the outside world and their society provides all possible comfort to them. However there is a catch: when the dwellers reach the age of thirty years old, their life clocks become red, accusing that it is time of renewal and they must participate in a ceremony called Carrousel. The misfits are called runners and they are chased by the police force called Sandmen and terminated. The efficient sandmen Logan 5 (Michael York) and Francis (Richard Jordan) work together and they are best friends. When Logan meets Jessica 6 (Jenny Agutter) in a sexual encounter, she sees that he is a sandman and refuses to have sex with him, claiming that it was a mistake of the circuit. Then Logan terminates a runner and when the computer analyzes the belongings of the victim, it assigns Logan to an undercover mission. His life clock is advanced in four years and he is ordered to take the key and seek the Ankh Sanctuary. He uses Jessica to help him, but he falls in love for her while chased by Francis. Logan questions the system and leaves the domed city with Jessica; in the outer world, they find and old man, changing their perspective of life beyond 30.""Logan's Run"" is one of the best sci-fi ever and absolutely ahead of time. Even in 2009 and after watching this feature at least six times, I still love it. The original and engaging story is supported by magnificent cinematography, scenarios, set decoration, special effects, costumes, make-up and music score. Jenny Agutter is amazing and shows a wonderful chemistry with Michael York. One of the best moments is when they do not know the meaning of ""beloved husband"" and ""beloved wife"" since these concepts do not exist in their society. Last but not the least, the name of my daughter was inspired in the character performed by Jenny Agutter. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Fuga no Século XXIII"" (""Escape in the 23rd Century"")Note: On 20 Aug 2015, I saw this film again.",Logan's Run
7,kosmasp,Run Logan Run,9,1 June 2020,"Well the title of the movie alone suggest something that lets us in on where this is leading. Still while the character is quite despicable at first, he has some questions, he has some issues with the status quo. You may like him at first or not, but he is our main man and he leads us into the movie and out of it (sort of).It is futuristic, though let's hope some of the things will never happen. Still the fact it is about don't believe what you see or hear, is quite eerie, especially considering what we had about a certain president. Now I don't like to get political during comments on movies, but you almost have to with a theme like this. And while certain things may be dated, the overall effects, especially considering the budget is really good. Enjoy it for what it is ... the 70s gave us some really interesting Science Fiction movies. Not all entertainment - this tries and mixes this with thoughtful fodder .... and it succeeds",Logan's Run
8,classicsoncall,"""One is terminated, one is born. Simple, logical, perfect.""",7,4 February 2012,"Apparently as far back as 1976 it was becoming increasingly evident that as a society, Americans were falling prey to a herd mentality and were much more interested in self gratification than principled dedication to acquiring knowledge and working hard to make something of themselves. By the year 2774, the Occupy Wall Street crowd would have attained their ultimate goal with the 99% living carefree with no thought for tomorrow except how to score some more freebies. The real thinkers of this society were branded as 'runners'; imagine the audacity of refusing to believe an authority that programs one's death at the age of thirty for mere convenience. Sort of like death panels on steroids.What the picture never explores is how things ever got to this point to begin with. Brief mention is made of a devastating war but that's about it. In yet another nod to universal conformity, the masses wear garb of two different colors only, red or green, indicating their respective age groups. This gave it the feel of an extended Star Trek episode, only a decade later and with about the same degree of creativity in set design. I noted with interest the long views of the cityscapes, they looked like those models of a futuristic city from exhibits I saw at the New York World's Fair in 1964. The story even ended like one of the better Star Trek episodes where circular logic is used to terminate a redundant program.My best takeaway from the picture was the character of the Old Man, quirkily portrayed by Peter Ustinov in a role that was right up his alley. He had that Dr. Seuss rhyming thing going for him along with a penchant for portraits of old Presidents. Oddly, they survived some eight hundred years in relatively good shape.As for the film's principals, Michael York and Jenny Agutter were generally competent in pulling off their one-dimensional roles. Not having seen this back in the day, the surprise of the picture for me was having Farrah Fawcett show up sporting the same hair-do that she wore in that best selling pin-up poster of all time. She looked like she stepped right off the set of 'Charlie's Angels' to make this picture, and she well may have as the timing involved would have worked well enough.Sci-fi movie junkies probably owe themselves at least a single viewing of ""Logan's Run"" given it's notoriety and controversial subject matter. Overall however, I didn't see a lot of new ground broken here in the way of story telling or special effects, certainly nowhere near the caliber of say ""Star Wars"" which came out just a year later. Even the dialog leaves a bit to be desired, although Ustinov had a great line near the end of the story. Hopefully he wasn't describing the picture when he said ""Nothing sadder than a dead fish"".",Logan's Run
9,gavin6942,Science Fiction Classic,7,26 July 2015,"Logan (Michael York) is a Sandman, someone who kills all those who refuse to sacrifice themselves on their 30th birthday. But when his clock starts ticking, Logan and Jessica (Jenny Agutter) make a run for it.I had seen this film in the mid-1990s for a class, and thought it was pretty good. Re-watching it now (2015), I can see why it is a science fiction classic, though some holes are now there. And I do not just mean plot holes (of which there are a few). The city exteriors are obviously a model, and it is almost humorous how easy it is to tell.But the story is very good and now a part of pop culture. The two leads are great, and I wish Agutter had done more horror and sci-fi in the 70s/80s. Farrah Fawcett's role is small and sort of peculiar. Peter Ustinov is great, and nice comedic relief. Now sure what was up with all the nudity, but...",Logan's Run
10,lee_eisenberg,"Happy 60th, Farrah!",7,3 February 2007,"Yesterday was Farrah Fawcett's 60th birthday (and it's good hear that she's cancer-free after a bout with it), so I wanted to review one of her movies, although she isn't the lead role in ""Logan's Run"". This is one of those '70s sci-fi movies that had a tinge of the counterculture in it, what with how Logan (Michael York) seeks to run away from this seemingly ""ideal"" society. I mean, let's face it: wasn't part of the social movement in the '60s a rejection of middle-class mores?True, the movie does have a slightly hokey '70s feel to itself - the sets, the music - but I find it hard not to like. And the idea of people getting discarded at thirty certainly reflects our young-celebrity-obsessed culture. Worth seeing. Also starring Richard Jordan, Jenny Agutter (looking as hot as ever) and Peter Ustinov.",Logan's Run
11,jboothmillard,Logan's Run,5,24 June 2009,"From director Michael Anderson (The New Adventures of Pinocchio), I had heard about this futuristic film, I think I might have even seen a spoof, so I had to at least try it. Set in the 23rd Century, 2274, survivors of a holocaust are now living in a domed city sealed from the outside world. In this society, all men and women live until the age of 30, because they need to control the population rate and resources amount. All these people go into the ""Carousel"", and some are promised to be reborn, but some choose to become ""Runners"" to escape death and head for the outside world. Logan (Michael York), a ""Sandman"" is one of the many men who kills these runners, and one day he is given an assignment to go up to age 30, pose as a runner, and destroy something called Sanctuary. On the run and being hunted by his partner Francis (Richard Jordan), Logan along with Jessica 6 (Jenny Agutter) go underground to find the resistance group helping the runners, and searching for Sanctuary. They eventually find work their way out of the domed city into an ancient looking and seemingly deserted Washington D.C. Eventually though they do find life with an Old Man (Peter Ustinov), and with proof that they don't need to die at age 30, and they can live outside, they head back to the city to destroy the system. Also starring Roscoe Lee Browne as Box, Farrah Fawcett as Holly, Michael Anderson Jr. as Doc and Gary Morgan as Billy. It may be a little dated by today's standards, and some of the dialogue and effects may be cheesy, but it is a science fiction thriller with some good moments. It won the Oscar for the Special Achievement Award for visual effects, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Cinematography. Worth watching!",Logan's Run
12,rmax304823,No SANCTUARY? Don't Tell Me.,7,22 April 2012,"I don't know that anyone could argue that Jennifer Agguter was a particularly expressive actress. She has even features and a geometric nose and wide eyes. She seems to wander through her films slightly open lipped, as if staring at a peculiar animal in a zoo. Nor is she especially graceful. She doesn't move like Diana Rigg or even Grace Kelly. She's walks flat footed. What she does have is a kind of unwitting sensuality. She seems as unaware of it as she is unaware of everything going on around her.Michael York carries his Oxford accent around with him and looks like one of the aristoi with a carefully groomed 1972 hair style. Every man has a 1972 haircut. Some things don't change in a thousand years.York and Agguter live with thousands of other young people in a domed city under the ground. It's all very modern and clean. Nobody has to wield a mop. But nobody gets past their 30th birthday. When they approach 30, they have to go to ""Carousel,"" in which they are lifted into the air to the cheers of the multitudes and are shot to pieces by machines or something. Once in a while, someone survives. In that case, he or she is sent to ""Sanctuary"", for which we can read ""Heaven."" York and Agguter decide to make a run for it and gain Sanctuary on their own. After many travails and tragedies -- including Farrah Fawcett Majors being blown up -- they reach ""Outside."" But Outside is hardly the Sanctuary they've been told of. What it is, is Washington, DC, in ruins, overgrown with kudzu and ivy. They meet Peter Ustinov, the only old person they've ever seen or heard of, and they marvel at his white hair and the ""cracks"" in his face, while Ustinov hams it up enjoyably and carries on about his many cats.If you try reading any sort of soteriological meaning into it, it gets complicated. We live in a false world. Everyone is stoned and happy, right? And when you are murdered at 30, if you're lucky at all, you get to go to Paradise or Sanctuary, which can't be much different from the world they've just left. And the Outside -- Washington in ruins -- isn't Paradise by any means. It's the real world. In other words (I guess) there is no Heaven, the movie tells us, only the real, rocky, uncomfortable world in which, if you are Jenny Agguter, you're liable to have a lizard (Sauromalus obesus) wriggle up under your hem. The closest we can come to Sanctuary is to make the best of the world we already live in.Okay. That's pretty airy. I won't argue. All I can say otherwise is that, regardless of whether I'm in Sanctuary or the underground city, it would be powerful nice to have Jenny Agguter swimming nude next to me, like Michael York. Just cause he's an Oxford man! Or -- never mind Michael York. Any normal man would settle for the lizard.",Logan's Run
13,Tweekums,An Overlooked '70s Sci-fi Classic,8,14 December 2008,"This film is obviously overshadowed by Star Wars, which was released the following year and has undeniably superior special effects, however it is defiantly worth watching as the story doesn't feel dated.Set in a domed city in a future world life appears to be good for the inhabitants, there is of course a catch. Everybody has a crystal implanting in their hand at birth and this changes colour as they age, once they reach thirty they have a choice, they can enter Carousel where they hope to renew, but in fact are killed or they can run in an attempt to live outside the city. It is Logan's job to hunt down and terminate anybody trying to run, a task he and his partner clearly enjoy. After one such kill Logan returns to his apartment and selects a girl he hopes to have sex with, however she regrets offering herself and after conversation she leaves.The next day when being debriefed about the runner Logan is given an unexpected task, he is told to seek out a place called Sanctuary where it is rumoured the runners are heading for. To enable him to do this he is told to keep the Ankh he found on the runner and has his life-clock reset so that instead of having four years left to live only has a very short while. To find out where to go he seeks out Jessica, the girl from the night before, as she was wearing an Ankh around her neck. Initially she is wary about trusting him but when he lets a runner go she realises he is telling the truth about wanting to run; unfortunately this act of kindness is witnessed by Logan's former partner who then becomes his hunter. When they run they go through the workings of the city and eventually find themselves in a frozen room where they meet a strange robot called Box who it turns out has been freezing everybody to run his way as his previous task had been freezing the food sent to him. Once outside Logan and Jessica make their way to a familiar city where they encounter a man older than anybody they have ever seen before.As stated before the special effects have dated somewhat, especially those used for Box and the music wasn't exactly pleasing on the ears. However the acting by Michael York and Jenny Agutter as Logan and Jessica is good and the story is exciting. Any Sci-fi fan who hasn't seen it should give it a go.",Logan's Run

To maintain the population balance, the computers that run the city have decreed that all people have to die at 30.

Logan, a sandman, whose job is to hunt fugitives , is sent on an assignment to find ""sanctuary,"" which is a code- word used by the master computer to describe what it thinks is a place to which runners have been getting away. Then Logan nearing the limit searches desperately for a way to avoid mandatory extermination . As a day outside the bubble Logan along with Jessica (Jenny Agutter) discover new emotions .This classic Sci-fi contains suspense , thrills , action , breathtaking production design and is pretty entertaining though with some feeble stereotypes . Impressive big-budgeted production by Saul David enhanced immeasurably by an enjoyable cast as Michael York , Jenny Agutter , Farrah Fawcett and special mention to great Peter Ustinov . Roscoe Lee Browne both voiced and performed Box the robot on-set. The unwieldy costume made it impossible for Browne to right himself if he fell over. Colorful and spectacular cinematography in Todd-Ao 35 by Ernest Laszlo . Rousing and evocative musical score by the maestro Jerry Goldsmith . Jerry uses a full orchestra with no electronic instruments when the action is outside of the city. When inside the city, his orchestra consists solely of strings, piano, and electronic instruments , the music at the beginning of the film during the credits does add the electronic instruments with the full orchestra though. Dated but effective miniatures about a domed city near Washington, D.C. It earned a special Academy Award for visual effects by Glen Robinson . The motion picture is originally directed by Michael Anderson . Rating : PG (Parents guide) for some nudism and violence. Good but overlong and some corny moments, worthwhile watching .

While their technologically advanced society caters for all of their needs, there is a catch: at the age of thirty, when the life-clock in their palm turns red, they must enter 'the carousel' for 'renewal' (in other words, it is time for them to be hoisted into the air by a forcefield and zapped with lasers while the other citizens watch in awe). Those who try to avoid renewal by running are terminated by the 'sandmen'.When the super-computer that controls the city learns of a place called Sanctuary, where many runners are rumoured to have fled, it tasks sandman Logan 5 (Michael York) with discovering its whereabouts, forcing him to pose as a runner by turning his life-clock red. Along with beautiful Jessica 6 (Jenny Agutter), who is also curious about Sanctuary, Logan attempts to escape the city, pursued by fellow sandman Francis (Richard Jordan). Once outside, Logan realises that his life thus far has been a lie and resolves to return to the city so that he can tell others the truth: that it is possible to reach old age.I first saw Logan's Run in 1976, at the age of eight, and it has stayed with me ever since. I'm not going to pretend that it's the greatest film of it's ilk—it has dated rather badly in places and seriously loses momentum during the second half—but there are just so many memorable things about this imaginative sci-fi film that it's impossible not to enjoy: the basic premise is rather brilliant, if a little flawed; the film's '70s vision of the future is so cheesy that it proves utterly irresistible; Jerry Goldsmith's bold score ranges from sterile bleepy electronica to fully blown orchestral grandeur; there's some wonderful matte paintings and impressive model-work; ditzy blonde Charlie's Angels actress Farrah Fawcett-Majors plays a ditzy blonde and gets blown up; Box, the killer robot that tries to freeze our heroes, is a truly menacing creation (despite his clunky appearance); and best of all, lovely Jenny Agutter gets naked (now that's the sort of thing an eight year old doesn't forget in a hurry!).7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",Logan's Run

Wooden science-fiction fantasy from a disappointing book by William F. Nolan and George Clayton Johnson would rate as a camp classic if it weren't so deadly serious. It's so incredibly earnest that one doesn't laugh and enjoy the picture so much as yawn. Still, the goofy dialogue and performances are occasionally colorful, and the primary filming location (a shopping mall in Texas) provides a perfect artificial sheen. Some of the gadgets are endearingly dumb, however the life-clocks are ingenious, as is the New You laboratory. Jerry Goldsmith's score is rousing, and Jenny Agutter is very attractive (if one-note) as York's accomplice/sidekick, yet the film is just too poky and ponderous.

18,tavm,I've finally seen the movie Logan's Run more than 30 years after watching the short lived TV series version,7,19 July 2010,"More than 30 years after watching the short lived TV series (of which I remember very little) based on this movie, I finally sat down and watched Logan's Run the feature in its entirety. Taken from the novel by William F. Nolan and George Clayton Johnson, Michael York plays the title character as a ""sandman"" who is basically someone who executes anyone who runs from ""Carrousel"" which is where anyone who turns 30 go for a supposed ""rebirth"". Richard Jordan plays fellow sandman Francis and Jenny Agutter plays Jessica who goes with Logan when he finds himself in a dangerous situation. There's also Roscoe Lee Browne as the robot Box, Michael Anderson, Jr. (the director's son) as Doc, a stunning young woman named Farrah Fawcett-Majors (she was then married to Lee Majors) as the confused Holly, and Peter Ustinov as the Old Man. I found the plot quite interesting though I kept wondering where Logan's loyalties lay part of the time even when it seemed his heart had changed. Ms. Fawcett herself seemed not too convincing in her performance though I did feel for her fate in the movie. Ms. Agutter was herself quite stunning especially when she disrobed briefly and Mr. Ustinov provided some nice amusing banter as an occasionally forgettable elderly person. I wasn't sure if the ending provided a good enough closure for me but having said all that, I found this feature version of Logan's Run quite entertaining for the most part especially whenever I heard Jerry Goldsmith's mix of orchestral and electronic scores on hand.

19,hitchcockthelegend,Life clocks are a lie! Carousel is a lie! THERE IS NO RENEWAL!,5,21 November 2009,"In the year 2274, Earths citizens live in a contended state. However, to keep the populace balanced, all citizens are sentenced to death upon reaching 30. Naturally not all citizens are thrilled by the idea and take too making a run for it. Enter the Sandmen, chosen specialists trained to hunt escapees down. When Sandman Logan 5 is sent on a mission by his computer superiors to find the place that runners head for, known only as Sanctuary, he finds that his existence and that of everybody else is not as they would believe.Based on the novel written by William F. Nolan, Logan's Run is a fine science-fiction premise not really given particularly great treatment by its makers. Quintessentially a 70s picture, the future vision thrown up by director Michael Anderson looks like, well, the 1970s. A shame because it has bags of guts and the cast, in spite of the creakiness that surrounds them, give it gusto supreme. Michael York and Jenny Agutter are the two main protagonists on the futuristic lam, encountering various obstacles and life changing discoveries, both are likable and engaging as hero and heroine respectively.The premise sees a world where suicide is enforced, nicely given a barmy religious overtone while also showing a mean humanity streak as the other citizens watch for glorious entertainment. Bonkers really, but some religions are just that, but lets not go there eh? There is also the theme of ageism and warnings about not letting technology get too commanding of the human way of life. It's all great source stuff from which to launch a truly inspiring dystopian picture, but Anderson and his back-room team fail to insert a darkness in the material. So basically the film ends up being an all too friendly piece about two sexy stars running around a lot to a 70s groove. Safe and amiable for sure, but this is one that really could do with a modern day remake to bravely realise its shady thematics. 5/10",Logan's Run
20,Scarecrow-88,Logan's Run,8,19 December 2009,"Like a lot of sci-fi fans, when I was a kid I fell in love with Logan's Run, thanks to the set design and models of the futuristic, automated city, the interesting premise(..regarding the order established where people must die once they reach 30, yet enjoy the pleasures of life before this stage, with those desiring to live past this age, deciding to attempt an escape, hunted down by specialized police known as ""sandmen"";there's a misguided belief that these people will enter a ""carousel"" to be ""renewed"" not knowing that this is essentially committing suicide), and the special effects involved using light and lasers.I was also quite receptive to Jenny Agutter's beauty(..mainly her pretty face and sexy legs aroused me, as she was supposed to, I guess)and thought the idea of a sandman, someone blindly loyal to the code established in everyone from the moment of birth, choosing to run, partnering with a young woman questioning the system behind carousel, quite exciting and interesting.I did find that once Logan 5(York), the sandman, and Jessica 6(Agutter)escape out of the city into an icy tunnel(..where they meet a homicidal robot following orders in it's programming to freeze and store food, humans who had made it to this point, never had escaped because they didn't have a weapon, the blaster gun Logan was equipped, to defend themselves), it lost some of it's magic..I just loved the look and feel of the city and so once we leave this fascinating place, reality returns us to a world we are accustomed to. Once Logan and Jessica are on the outside, greeted by the sun, recognizing the world that exists from beyond the claustrophobic confines of the domed city, it tends to drag, but the story is developing the characters..having lived in absolute comfort, without understanding the real difficulties of striving to survive on their own without automated assistance, they come to realize there's so much more than just enjoying a life of leisure and lust.The large portion of the first half has Logan and his partner(..and best friend)Francis(Richard Jordan)laying out to us the temperament of acceptance in this way of life, pondering why people would bother running, instead of seeking renewal. Logan finds that there's talk about a ""sanctuary"", a place of refuge outside the domed city, while in the ""debriefing"" room where sandmen go to turn in the valuables confiscated from dead runners. The computer insists that Logan leave the city, find the sanctuary, and kill the runners who had successfully fled(..this is where he discovers that there's no renewal, his life span is increased to where he must die, and provides motivation for him to run). When Logan is able to convince Jenny to assist him in fleeing the city, they must evade sandmen, including Francis who later pursues them outside. They find Washington DC in ruins, covered in vines and branches, and meet an elderly hermit played by Peter Ustinov. This is where the film slows down a bit as Logan and Jenny find this old man, with gray hair and wrinkles. His cats, a graveyard, the idea of a mother and father, not to mention being introduced to the method of marriage and burial. As is inevitable, Francis, still, despite what he is witnessing, rejects what his eyes produce, remaining loyal to the system established since his birth, and engages in combat with Logan. It doesn't have to be this way, but Logan has to defend himself or else be killed because Francis is manic and enraged. Knowing that others will continue to die if he doesn't do something, Logan will decide to return to the city in order to stop carousel and introduce the people to the outside and a life past 30.I thought the matte art fictionalizing Washington DC landmarks in ruin were phenomenal, even though the film spends a long time inside one large building with a rather senile Ustinov who has spent a great deal of time alone. Those ""maze cars"" which ride on a railway leading to other areas of the city I remember feeling fondly of as a kid still remain rather cool to me even though I hadn't watched this since the 90's. I guess what special effects disappointed me the most was the ice cave collapse because it just seemed to lack the same wizardry of what came before it..a minor quibble since I was so completely dazzled by what the filmmakers had already given me. I love Goldsmith's decision to use those weird and hypnotic score for inside the city, opting for a more orchestral musical arrangement once Logan and Jessica are outside.",Logan's Run

It pulls you right in with a real candy store of futuristic images. Obviously MGM spared no expense in making this picture. It's quite captivating, and holds your interest for a while. It's got some very alluring outfits for Agutter; in general, the costumes designed by Bill Thomas are impressive. The action scenes are well done, and there is some fairly shocking (but not THAT gory) violence for a PG rated film.Then the oppressive atmosphere gives way to a whole second act that is, comparatively speaking, on the boring side, as Logan and Jessica see what life is REALLY is like outside the dome, encountering a senile old man, played to the hammy hilt by Peter Ustinov. This whole portion is not completely without interest, as Logan and Jessica are awakened to a totally different kind of existence (for example, one in which children actually know their parents). Things pick up again once Logans' former friend Francis (Richard Jordan) re-enters the story.On the whole, this is an appealing saga, one that attempts to appeal to adult intellects as well as dazzling them with special effects and production design. The performances are basically fine; also appearing are Roscoe Lee Browne as a clunky looking robot named ""Box"" and Farrah Fawcett.

Also the special effects (which were state of the art in 1976) look laughable today. They are SO obviously small models. The sequence in the ice kingdom is especially bad. There's also Roscoe Lee Browne in an utterly stupid costume as the robot Box. Seriously--that costume wouldn't pass muster back in a 1940s serial! Then there's Peter Ustinov as the old man in a part that's just plain embarrassing. Agutter (a great actress) gives a rare bad performance here--very wooden and blank.On the plus side--York is VERY good and Jordan is even better even though he's obviously WAY over 30 (he was 39 when he did this); Agutter has a brief nude scene which will please some of the viewing audience; Farrah Fawcett-Majors has a small role; future Olympic gold medalist Mitch Gaylord has an small uncredited role and there's an excellent score by Jerry Goldsmith.

The story is a neat notion that life must end at thirty which could have been taken in so many directions. Just imagine knowing that you will not live beyond thirty. That would really suck because nowadays forty is the new thirty! Those who tried to escape were called runners and generally they were those who had reached the big three-o.

But then Logan and Jessica (Jenny Agutter) become runners themselves, pursued by Logan's Sandman friend Francis (Richard Jordan) and, in so doing, become the first people to leave the city in living memory.The main problem with Logan's Run is that it is showing its age, and the effects which were once special now aren't. In particular, the miniature cityscapes, so important in establishing the initial ambiance, no longer pass muster - they are singularly unconvincing. Roscoe Lee Brown's outfit for robot Box almost makes you laugh out loud and, worst of all, Peter Ustinov's old man is simply dreadful.

While life there seems fun, it only lasts till age 30 when citizens are required to participate in a life-ending ritual that supposedly grants rebirth. Those who rebel are gunned down by likable Nazi-like police called Sandmen. Michael York plays a Sandman named Logan, who's forced to flee, while Jenny Agutter plays his potential babe, Jessica. Richard Jordan appears as another Sandman.There's just enough good in ""Logan's Run"" to make it worthwhile for those who can handle 70's sci-fi in all its glory and shame. The flick comes across as a 70's Star Trek movie albeit without space travel and the iconic characters. York plays a quality protagonist and Agutter is exquisite throughout in her attractive (not slutty) apparel. Several quality women also appear in the background.Although this is an old production, the hi-tech society is realized pretty well and still LOOKS genuinely futuristic with quality visuals throughout, although decidedly 70's and relatively low-budget. The story, however, is only moderately interesting, but I like the themes of anti-ageism, pro-family and anti-hedonism. Like Star Trek, there's some action, but it's mostly an adult drama. Of course it's nowhere near as compelling as Star Trek, whether The Original Series or The Motion Picture, but I suppose it's about on par with the early seasons of The Next Generation and superior in some ways.The film runs 119 minutes and was shot in the Dallas/Arlington/Fort Worth area and Malibu Creek State Park, California, with interiors done in Houston and studio work in Culver City, California.

They used locations with the glossy sheen and angular architecture of shopping malls and convention centers (which I do like, especially back in the '70s). But the production design in those places was impressive; very much of that time and attitude. And eventually we get to the foliage-overgrown D.C. which itself is a good image. It's not lost on me that I appreciated this superficially, just as its society vacuously prized attractive youth over middle age.And as a movie, it's entertaining, but doesn't get going until the second half when York and Agutter start running. In some ways, it felt influenced by ""Planet of the Apes"", but was never as good. Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie in a junk food sort of way. A little empty.

33,ShadeGrenade,The Sandman cometh,9,16 September 2006,"There's an amusing scene in 'Free Enterprise' when a sci-fi fan turns thirty and dreams he is in 'Logan's Run'. The movie in question came out shortly before 'Star Wars', and was one of the last films of its kind for some time - the dysfunctional futuristic thriller. Based on a novel by William F.Nolan and George Clayton Johnson, it is set in a world where the inhabitants live in a domed city where they have everything they could possibly want - free love and recreational drug taking are the norm - but there is a catch. Each citizen has a crystal embedded in his/her hand which starts blinking by the time they approach the age of thirty. As soon as it turns black, they are subjected to the bizarre ordeal of 'Carousel'. They believe it to be renewal, but in fact it is death.Logan ( Michael York ) is a 'Sandman', a security officer trained to track down and kill 'Runners' - those who try and escape Carousel. He is ordered by the central computer to run in order to find and destroy 'Sanctuary', the mythical refuge sought by all Runners. Accompanied by the beautiful Jessica ( Jenny Agutter ), Logan does as he is told, only to be stalked by fellow Sandman, Francis ( the late Richard Jordan ). The two men, once like brothers, are now sworn enemies... A film of 'Logan's Run' was mooted as far as back as the late '60's ( shortly after the book's publication ) with fantasy maestro George Pal producing from a script by James Bond scribe Richard Maibaum. But the eventual film came from Saul David, producer of 'Our Man Flint' and 'Fantastic Voyage' ( 1966 ). Michael Anderson, later responsible for 'The Martian Chronicles' mini-series, sat in the director's chair. For the first hour or so, David Zelag Goodman's script sticks to the book, right up to the encounter with Box ( Roscoe Lee Browne ), a robot who has been freezing the runners, and tries to do the same with Logan and Jessica. But then the story goes in a different direction. The book took Logan and Jessica to different locations all over the planet, but in the movie they don't stray far from the city before returning, with a cat-obsessed Old Man ( Peter Ustinov ) in tow, resulting in a spectacular ending. York and Agutter are good ( the latter incredibly beautiful in her 23rd century clothes ), while the underrated Jordan steals every scene he is in. 'Logan's Run' has a strong message we would do well to heed in today's youth-dominated society. It basically says that old age is something we should be proud to achieve, not strive to avoid. Worth watching for the dazzling art direction, eye-catching special effects and Jerry Goldsmith's powerful music. Farrah Fawcett-Majors has a small role as receptionist 'Holly'.A short-lived television series ( starring Gregory Harrison and Heather Menzies ) followed, along with a seven-issue Marvel comic. Normally I hate remakes but would love to see this redone as per the book. It may never happen though as today's remakes have more emphasis on flashy action than plot and characterisation. 'Logan's Run' deserves better than to become just another mindless C.G.I. extravaganza.",Logan's Run
34,JamesHitchcock,Don't trust anyone over thirty- kill them.,5,27 June 2008,"In the 1970s there was a clear division of opinion among film-makers about how the future would look. Those who made films like ""Rollerball"", Westworld"" and ""Capricorn One"" did so on the assumption that the future would look like a marginally trendier version of the seventies and that they could therefore save money on designing expensive sets and costumes. The other school of thought held that the future would look very different from the present, although even this school tended to rely on a few clichés rather than use their imaginations. ""Logan's Run"" was made according to the tenets of this second school, and duly trots out their standard received ideas. We learn, for example, that in the twenty-second century all buildings will still be in the Modernist style of the twentieth, only made of plastic rather than steel, glass and concrete. Men will wear Lycra shell-suits and women diaphanous mini-dresses. Everyone will travel by monorail or moving walkway. And everyone will be young, beautiful, fit and healthy.The plot borrows elements from a number of other science-fiction works. From Arthur C. Clarke's ""The City and the Stars"" it borrows the idea of a domed city, hermetically sealed off from the outside world. From Huxley's ""Brave New World"" it borrows baby factories; children are not born naturally but produced in hatcheries. The scenes of a ruined Washington DC owe something to the ""Statue of Liberty"" scene in ""Planet of the Apes"".""Logan's Run"" has one original idea of its own. There is a good reason why everyone is young, beautiful, fit and healthy; at the age of thirty everyone is subject to compulsory ritual euthanasia (euphemistically known as ""renewal""). The greatest crime is to ""run"", to try and leave the city in order to escape this fate. The title character, Logan, is a ""sandman"", one of an elite police force whose function is to hunt down and kill runners. The film explores what happens when Logan himself becomes a ""runner"" and tries to leave the city with Jessica, a beautiful girl with whom he has fallen in love. Pursued by Francis, a former colleague of Logan, they escape to a now-ruined Washington where they meet an old man living with only cats for company.There are a number of gaps in the plot; it is never explained how Washington came to be ruined, what has become of its former inhabitants or how Peter Ustinov has managed to survive there while everyone else has been killed or fled. Plot-holes are not necessarily a bad thing in science fiction; we do not, for example, waste much time while watching the original ""Planet of the Apes"" in wondering how the apes came to take over the Earth. (There were, of course, four sequels made in which it was explained exactly how they did so, but none of those sequels is anywhere near as good as the original). There is, however, a more vital plot-hole in ""Logan's Run"", one which I think does affect our enjoyment.The film is (like ""Brave New World"" and Orwell's ""1984"") an example of dystopian science fiction. Although such works are ostensibly set in the future, they are really satires on the ages in which they were written. Their purpose is to draw attention to some feature of modern society which the author finds objectionable and to show how that feature could, at some future date, have disastrous consequences. (Orwell's main targets were totalitarian ideologies like fascism and communism). The main character is typically a young man who is discontented with the values of his society.In general ""Logan's Run"" follows this pattern. The social evils against which it appears to be targeted are the ""generation gap"", the tendency, very prevalent in the sixties and seventies, to glorify youth at the expense of age and the ""don't trust anyone over thirty"" mentality. Logan is the young malcontent equivalent to Winston Smith or John the Savage, with Jessica the equivalent of Julia or Lenina. In one important respect, however, it departs from the standard model. Most dystopian novels have a ""raisonneur"", equivalent to O'Brien in ""1984"" or Mustapha Mond in ""Brave New World"", whose task is to persuade the rebellious hero to conform to the values of his society. There is no equivalent character in ""Logan's Run"", so we never find out exactly what the ruling value-system of Logan's city is, why it is considered necessary to kill off the entire population in the prime of their lives and why so many people accept this fate uncomplainingly.When I recently saw this film for the first time in many years, I realised that I had confused its plot with that of the spin-off TV series. In that series the city was controlled by a hidden elite of elderly men who killed off everyone else at thirty in order to prevent their power from being challenged. Francis was so anxious to hunt down his former friend because he had been promised membership of this elite if he succeeded. Although the series was not a great success, it did at least try and answer some of the questions that the film avoided.Michael York, 34 when the film was made, is strictly speaking too old for his role, but looks youthful enough to get away with it. (Richard Jordan, who plays Francis, was 38). The lovely Jenny Agutter makes an appealing heroine as Jessica. Jenny was one of a number of British actresses from around this period who looked to be on the verge of becoming major Hollywood stars but never quite made it. Seen as a simply science-fiction adventure the film provides some exciting moments, although some scenes today seem unintentionally comic, especially the one with Box, the frozen-food processing robot.

And true it's no ""Star Wars"" yet it entertains and has the themes of dread trapped doom and hope for escape written all over it with a totalitarian and authoritarian rule all about it. Set in the year 2274 humans live in a much different type of city world one that is bubbled and sheltered in. With computerized service and mechanisms ruling it's a land of ever on going confusing and hedonism. Only when ""Lastday"" arrives all those at the age of 30 must submit to ""Carrousel"" a spinning trip to death and then a rebirth of new life! Really a sci-fi kickoff of fun, journey and escape you will cheer for Michael York as a ""Sandman"" who's trying to terminate the ""Runners"" on the prowl and ""Logan"" is almost 30 so the film is a try and catch type! Overall good watch to pass time it's a different blended type of sci-fi film and also look for the now late Farrah Fawcett in one of her first and very early roles.",Logan's Run
36,DKosty123,A Sci-Fi Period Piece,7,5 June 2010,"When I saw this movie it reminded me of Fritz Lang's Metropolis in that the sets designed for this had to be fairly large & expensive. As this was before Star Wars, the effects in this one are before computer animation. Over all it is a lot of fun as long as you don't take it too seriously. Keep in mind, there are ragged edges that show, especially now, but when taken as a whole the film is OK, never to be a classic.It reflects the morality of when it was made. The set up the main male characters use when they can just order up any hot looking babe for sex is from the era before HIV & a dream that will never happen, Utopia for sure.Michael York, Farrah, & the cast are solid & at times given some workable script. While this is not a great film, it will be interesting too see the remake in 3D being proposed. Besides the potential of doing these sets really right in 3D with today's computer animation, I suggest that a good writer (please keep Tim Burton's crew from the Planet of The Apes Remake Away) or writing crew rework the script to match the 3D. This would make this remake a potential smash.As I recall, this film on release did little business, but has developed a cult following like some other sci-fi classics from the same era. Sometimes, a film that does no business on release does just that. The eye candy is still here in this original & I wonder if the new one can match the female power. That makes me wish I was a casting director for the remake as I am sure the one who cast the original sure got a look at a lot of great scenery.",Logan's Run
37,lasttimeisaw,A reboot of this picture has been in the pipeline for years but to no avail,7,11 November 2016,"A 70s USA grandiose Sci-Fi picture directed by Oscar-nominated UK director Michael Anderson from AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS (1956) fame. Loosely adapted from its titular novel, LOGAN'S RUN depicts an Utopian future in the year of 2274, where the residue of human beings are living in a sealed dome city, everything is under the reign of a super-computer, designed to cater to all aspects of human's needs, only with one proviso, whoever reaches 30-year-old, must volunteer to a ritual called ""Carrousel"", to start their life anew, those who refuse to abide this rule, which are termed as""runners"", will be hunted and terminated by a team of armed police forces called""Sandmen"", and our protagonist Logan 5 (York) is one of them, a fairly good one too. In its opening wheeze, audience witnesses this ostensible Carrousel rebirth, a surprisingly commendable feat involving a magnificent flying-wire stunt, still can feasibly grab our attention 40 years after its birth, where those 30-year-old birthday men/women are gathered together in their monotonous garbs, then start to defy gravity and float upwards under the propulsion of an energy field, hailed by frenetic onlookers, until being individually shot down by laser beams, which consummates their so-called ritual renewal, but an unsettling frisson penetrates our mind, what is really happening? Other than the occasional disruptions caused by Runners, this mega-computer organized dome city is a hedonistic paradise, it is retro-futuristically antiseptic and every youngster is uniformly dressed with a specific color scheme according to ages, there is no concept of family, one can choose his or her ideal sex partner through a unique transportation booth, and there is a neon-lit love shop in the arcade, solely to gratify one's sexual desire. Face-lifting and body-modification technology is also super-advanced. Soon Logan is assigned by the computer to operate an under-handed mission, his age being adjusted from 26 to reaching 30, Logan must infiltrate the group of Runners, so as to locate a secret place named Sanctuary, where people can live without age limitation, and destroy it. So in a befuddling flurry, Logan begins his run, along with a young rebel Jessica 6 (Agutter), whilst tailed by his task-unwitting Sandman best-friend Francis 7 (Jordan). In a valiant fashion, Logan and Jessica wreak havoc in a posh beautification center, get in touch with Runners and encounter a proto-robot Box (Lee Browne, one year prior the emergence of STAR WARS), who timely corroborates that the renewal is a hoax, those being dispatched by laser beams are frozen in his storage room with a frightening subtext hinting cannibalism. Eventually, after escaping the city and ascending onto the surface through an elevator, they (and viewers too) realize the city is entirely built underground, whereas the terra firma is totally derelict and abandoned, until they chance upon the last man alive in a ruined Washington DC, the old man (Ustinov), who will give scattershot information of a past world which is more aligned with today's notion, followed by a final showdown between Logan and Francis. But what about the Sanctuary? Where is it? Maybe there has never been one, it is simply a myth to elicit hope and strength to disillusioned Runners. In an overtly rash third act, Logan and Jessica take the old man with them, as a living proof that life doesn't need to being ended at 30, to unveil the inconvenient truth of their Utopian world and exact the final liberation, which comes off as suspiciously handy in a palpably sagging finale. Shot in wide-angle splendor, the film simultaneously embodies the cutting-edge Special Effect technology and betrays the outdated modus operandi of its days, however the concept of its escapist future-world, bolstered by an intrusively retro-futuristic score from Jerry Goldsmith, presciently precedes the more insidious, and virtual-reality blurring milieu of THE MATRIX trilogy, a congenial cast also helps to keep the movie entertaining, York is motivated enough to represent Logan less a cipher than he is designed, and Agutter is predictably pigeonholed an under- developed but eye-pleasing foil, plus a muttering impromptu Ustinov is just too much a jewel in the fray. A reboot of this picture has been in the pipeline for years but to no avail, then if one can spike the archetype story with some more topical elements such as clones and advanced A.I., taking a leaf from the book of the with-it TV series WESTWORLD, perhaps television is a more liberal and benign alternative presently, albeit the studio had already made a TV-spin off in 1977 after the movie's success, which only lasted for one season.",Logan's Run
38,Red-Barracuda,A great looking sci-fi film that fuses ideas with action,8,28 April 2013,"Logan's Run is a 70's sci-fi movie that fell slap bang between the intellectualism of the earlier 2001: A Space Odyssey and the later action-adventurism of Star Wars. It seemed to allude to the past while hinting at the future that sci-fi was about to take. As a result, it is very satisfying. Its mix of dark dystopian conundrums with fast-paced action works very well.It's set in an enclosed world in a post-apocalyptic Earth. The inhabitants lead hedonistic, care-free lives. But the catch is that everybody has to submit to forced euthanasia at the age of thirty. The vast majority of the brain-washed populace, however, believe what they are told by their overlords and think that they will be renewed to live their lives again. The story tells of a sandman (a state hit-man) who starts to have doubts about this and is sent on a mission to the outside world to find a place called Sanctuary.Over and above everything, what makes Logan's Run such a delight is the excellent set-design and detailed model work. The colourful large interiors of the domed world are extremely attractive, while the ice caves and overgrown Washington D.C. are very well done also. The model work may look like, well, model work but it's beautifully designed and adds a certain charm. The story itself is good enough; although things do slow down somewhat once the characters leave their city and venture outside leading to a rather unsatisfying ending. But there is enough quality beforehand to make up for this. The film benefits from its two principal actors, Michael York and Jenny Agutter. York is as reliable as always, while Agutter probably steals the show as the beautiful and mysterious Jessica 6.",Logan's Run
39,Rainey-Dawn,Super Good Sci-Fi Classic!,9,16 November 2020,"This film is highly dated without a doubt: The cheesy 1970s sci-fi clothing, the overall look, hair styles and make-up, the ""disco"" look of the Carrousel room - yet the film is so good it's easy to overlook these things.The year is 2274, in the 23rd Century. There is has been a problem of overpopulation for a long time but the problem has been solved when you have to die on your 30th birthday under the guise of being ""renewed"".

41,KineticSeoul,Read the book instead,3,12 October 2010,"Now I can tell this movie would have been enjoyable during the late 1970's, but seeing this for the first time in 2010 it is just plain silly and stupid. Who knows maybe some aspects of this film might happen in the future, besides the lame futuristic clothes and setting. Especially the clothes and style it looks like something from the 70's not the future. I you have seen this movie at a young age during the 70's or maybe 80's you could probably find this movie to be kinda engaging, but seeing it now everything about it, is just plain silly and lame. Plus I couldn't get myself to like the character Logan or have any sympathy towards that character. I could careless what happens to him, actually I was more rooting for him to be caught. Since his change only comes about after it's his turn killed off and finding out the truth of what is really going on behind the scene. The plot is pretty simple as well, they say everything goes to hell when you turn 40, but in this case it's when you turn 30. Like I said, I could tell how this movie would have intrigued some people during it's time it came out. Now it just seems outdated and dull. Plus the supposed futuristic cities look like some malls put together, and look so much like toys which they are in real life at the same time. The elements in this movie has now been done way better, so maybe that is why I am being a bit harsh. But seeing it now, it really is a campy and dull movie.3.8/10",Logan's Run
42,gridoon,Uneven but imaginative.,7,19 October 1999,"Despite some dated elements, the first part of this film is terrific. The pacing is fast, the direction solid and York's performance excellent: we get a hero we can identify with. The second part is weaker, with Ustinov's character being mostly an irritation because, as someone else here commented, he is given nothing of interest to say. The ending is also kind of simplistic, for such an imaginative movie. Still, the unbelievably beautiful Jenny Agutter is on-screen most of the time...and the film is good enough.",Logan's Run
43,Lejink,No home run,4,2 September 2010,"I have fond memories as a teenager of the short-lived TV series spin-off from this movie, in fact at the time I wasn't even aware there was a movie before-hand. Although I haven't seen the TV show since then, it left a better impression on me than this rather drawn-out, poorly scripted and acted film.Perhaps the actors in the TV series had more time to get into their roles, but here Michael York's acting fails to greatly differentiate himself from one of the trees in the forest, while Jenny Agutter, fetching enough in a shorty-negligee, seems to be reading her lines from scene to scene and wouldn't you know, she gets another, albeit brief, nude scene (c.f. ""Walkabout"", Equus""). That master of accents Peter Ustinov makes a somewhat misplaced appearance at the end as an eccentric pensioner from the over-world, employing an accent which sounds like its mutated from all the others he's ever spoken, while the late Farrah Fawcett-Majors demonstrates too easily why she was plucked a little later for her lead appearance in the fluff that was ""Charlie's Angels"", i.e. act dumb but look pretty.The story could have been interesting, euthanasia and the demographic difficulty of an ageing world population still being in the news today, but once Sandman (i.e. security guard / enforcer) Logan starts out on his run, just ahead of former best buddy and fellow Sandman Francis, now turned pursuer, none of his and Jessica's adventures are really, well, adventurous.Money was definitely spent on the production however as evidenced by the set design in particular, but the story writes itself into a dead end and even cadges its surprise twist from the earlier ""Planet Of the Apes"" when we discover that their outside playground is actually the ruins of Washington D.C.I'm afraid too there are too many toe-curlingly embarrassing moments, like York and Agutter's love scenes, York's under-powered duel to the death with Francis and that ending which reminds me of nothing so much as the old Coca Cola ""I'd Like to Teach The World to Sing"" advert from yesteryear.I'll still try to hunt down the TV series on DVD one day from E-Bay, but this looks to me like a movie that was actually improved by the transition to the small screen.",Logan's Run
44,atlasmb,Dated And Uninspiring,6,15 February 2017,"I was in my twenties when I saw this film during its original release. I enjoyed it. As a fan of science fiction, I appreciated any attempt to bring science fiction to the big screen. But ""Logan's Run"" has not aged well over the intervening years.First of all, other science fiction films have had much more to say and better technical features. For example, ""Blade Runner""--a film with some similarities, but a stronger message and much more technique and atmosphere. Compared to ""Blade Runner""--which came only six years later, ""Logan's Run"" feels like it was shot in a warehouse for an industrial film. Likewise, ""Soylent Green"" and ""Planet of the Apes"" make ""Logan's Run"" look rather amateurish.Its special effects, in particular, are disappointing. But its message--whatever that might be--has much less impact than these other sci-fi films of that era.The portrayals of the two main characters, played by Michael York and Jenny Agutter, are rather flat. Perhaps they were confused by the ambiguous purpose of the plot, because they feel like they are walking through much of the film. The film is interesting to watch, as a product of its time, but there are many other sci-fi films that deserve greater attention.",Logan's Run
45,The-Sarkologist,Why don't they make movies like this anymore,10,6 November 2012,"I remember seeing this movie for the first time when I was a kid and my mother loved it. In fact whenever it was on television my mother would sit down and watch it, though I would think that it was a little touch and go. However, years later, I watched it again and I must say that this film pretty much blew me away, and so when I saw it on DVD I bought it instantly, and when I brought it home, my Mum basically took it and put it amongst her collection of DVDs (and while I could jump up and down about her doing this, considering what my mum has done for me, her taking and keeping one of my DVDs is a minor thing).Look, we could talk a lot about the touch and go acting, and the 1970's special effects, or the continuity flaws, but that is not what I write about when I come to movies. Personally I prefer to write about the content, the themes, and the plot, and in this regard this movie simply stands out on all accounts. The book upon which this film is based is pretty ordinary, and as such this is one of those very rare occasions where we can say that the film is actually better than the book. In fact, after watching this film again, I toyed with the idea of rereading the trilogy, but decided that waiting to return to Adelaide to pick up the books was probably not worth it and thus I think I will just write my commentary based on the movie alone which, once again, is something that not many movies enable one to do.Basically the movie is about a dystopian world were everybody lives in what they believe to be a perfect hedonistic society with only one catch, life must end at 30. They are led to believe that once they turn 30 they go to a place of carousal where there will be reborn as children to live life over again. However some are suspicious about this and attempt to escape this fate, which a faction known as the Sandmen are employed to prevent.While some may consider this to be a Utopian world, in reality this is a dystopian world, and it is a world that I suspect that Nolan, the writer of the original book, could see where we were heading. Earth had been destroyed (so they believed) by a war, and the outside was uninhabitable, so humanity created domed cities in which to live. However this world is a world of hedonistic pleasure, but it is also a world where progress does not exist. It is a tyranny, a tyranny where a computer rules and its tyranny is enforced by the Sandmen. People are not allowed to think, and in a way thinking is discouraged through excessive pleasure.The movie is about a search for truth, as Logan, who is originally sent on a secret mission to attempt to uncover a place called sanctuary, believed to be the place where successful runners have fled to. However it quickly becomes apparent that it does not exist. Unfortunately, by the time Logan realises this, it is too late. He has been exposed to the truth, he has seen the outside, and he has seen old age and the beauty of it, and has not choice but to return and attempt to reveal the truth to the people living in their hedonistic dream world.I guess this movie, and the book in a way, confronts us with this reality. The hedonistic world is a stagnant world which does not progress. Humanity is killed off at the age of Thirty, meaning that people cannot pass down wisdom of the ages. People do not see beyond their thirtieth year, and have no exposure to the older generation. They basically live only in the now and only experience the now. In a way, it is not a dystopian future, but a criticism of the present, much in the same way that 1984 was a criticism of the present. The movie, made thirty years after World War II, a war that ravaged the world, has morphed into a dystopian world where pleasure is the only thing that keeps people going. Many of the famous stars of this era were dying at the age of 27, and in a way this has continued. In fact, the further we go, the less interested in history and the past we become, and the more disconnected from the older generation we become as well. In a way, we all need a Logan to expose us to the truth, so that we do not, like Logan's world, become caught up in a stagnant cycle of a history that never seems to go anywhere.",Logan's Run
46,tomgillespie2002,Best viewed on a wet Sunday afternoon,5,19 May 2013,"In the 2274, the last remaining collection of humans live in a domed utopia ran by a computer, where they live out a hedonistic lifestyle until they reach the age of 30. Their hands are implanted with a light that changes colour as they get older, and when they hit 30, they are forced to take part in the Carrousel, where they are vaporised, believing they are part of a 're-birth' cycle. The majority accept this as part of their natural existence, but a select few, known as Runners, recognise the brutality of population control. To counteract this, there are Sandmen, a sort of police force tasked with tracking and killing any Runners. After killing one such Runner, Sandman Logan 5 (Michael York) finds an ankh pendant on the body, to which the computer recognises as a symbol of Sanctuary, a mythical place seen as the escape by the Runners. The computer tells Logan 5 he must find Sanctuary, and his lifespan is shortened to hasten his quest, so he enlists the help of Jessica 6 (Jenny Agutter), a potential Runner who wears an ankh pendant.With its bold, bright futuristic sets and obligatory shiny jumpsuits, Logan's Run is one of those 1970's ever-so-camp cult sci-fi's that no- one really takes seriously regardless of it's social message. The film itself certainly takes itself seriously, but has dated so badly it is best viewed as a bit of a guilty pleasure. Certainly one of those films to watch on a rainy bank holiday or a Sunday afternoon. It certainly has it's moments - occasionally it slips into a hypnotic and slightly psychedelic wish-wash of flashing red lights and green death-rays, that can't help but grab your attention. Half the time I didn't really know what was happening, certainly a fault on my part, but the film wasn't holding my attention long enough for me to keep up with the plot and narrative twists, despite all the visual splendour on show.Yet the actual plot device that jump-starts Logan's journey is itself confusing. Why does the computer send Logan on this mission simply for finding the ankh pendant, a symbol that is worn in plain sight by many members of the Runners? Why shorten Logan's lifespan, as this will surely give him enough reason to become a Runner himself and escape his unfairly premature demise? Clearly logic isn't given enough attention, but Logan's Run contains enough cornball lines of dialogue, hilarious 1970's haircuts, and rather useless laser guns, to justify it's cult following. It's far too long, but a nice reminder of a time where sci-fi was still primarily rooted in satire, regardless of how successful it is.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Logan's Run

50,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Glitzy, weird sci fi that uses imagination to cover other faults",6,25 June 2012,"Sometimes timing is everything in the movie world. If ""Logan's Run,"" which premiered in 1976, had come out a year later, there's no way anyone would've remembered it in the midst of the ""Star Wars"" pandemonium that broke out in '77. In fact, Michael Anderson's sci-fi dystopia could've used a George Lucas/Industrial Light and Magic touch.It's not that ""Logan's Run"" lacks for imagination, however, as it's a colorful, abstract vision and Anderson is unafraid to milk the effects and the production design, even if it means exposing how cheap they look.Based on the 1967 novel by William F. Nolan and George Clayton Johnson, ""Logan's Run"" takes place in the 23rd Century when what's left of humanity lives in domed cities with pleasure and happiness being the sole focus of existence. Not a raw deal, except for the fact that everyone's killed off at age 30 in order to maintain equilibrium. This ""catch"" causes many almost-30-year-olds to try and run, and it's Logan 5's (Michael York) job as a Sandman to stop them when they do.This world is more visually fleshed out than it is through storytelling. Everyone dresses in loose-fitting clothes of either red, green or yellow to indicate their age range and silver amusement park-like trains transport people between locations. Sex is also an open part of society, but for censorship reasons that doesn't quite come across.This dystopia is the focus of the first half of the film, and consequently it's superior half. There's plenty of date special effects to laugh at, but everything's too imaginative to not get excited or fascinated by it. The renewal ceremony for 30-year-olds hoping to be selected for a longer life is one of the most bizarre and delightfully unnecessary spectacles ever committed to film.But all along we know that Logan is the seed that will disrupt the system, so this rich, weird world begins to fade once we have the context Anderson feels we need to continue with the story. Logan is very happy with his role as a Sandman, but after exterminating a runner carrying the Ankh symbol, he's asked to secretly investigate by posing undercover as a runner. When he realizes he's about to have some years taken away from him and might not get them back, he turns into an actual runner. He seeks out Jessica (Jenny Agutter), a green girl who he previously saw wearing an Ankh and together they try and find the necessary channels to escape. On their trail, however, is Francis 7 (Richard Jordan), Logan's friend and Sandman partner.Sadly, when Logan and Jessica finally escape to the outside, the movie gets remarkably dull and the script even worse. The city is somewhere near Washington D.C., as we see the Capitol, the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial all covered in vines. Writer David Zelag-Goodman then wastes our time giving Logan and Jessica lines in which they wonder what life was like here long ago on the outside, a social commentary that's anything but subtle (or necessary). Considering our curiosity is all about what goes on inside the dome, this second act disappoints.In it, we meet Peter Ustinov's character, an old man who has been living in the House of Representatives. He's the only old man these people have ever met, but he carries no secrets for us. He's vital to this world and the story, but we never feel it because we have trouble empathizing in this regard with our main characters.But ""Logan's Run"" is still gutsy, over-the-top sci fi that would make Flash Gordon shed a tear. There's so much here that you want the film to explore that it never does (I would extremely welcome the planned remake from Nicolas Winding Refn starring Ryan Gosling), but the point is that you at least think about it. ""Logan's Run"" will definitely expand your mind and satisfy the biggest fans of dystopian fiction.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com",Logan's Run
51,funkyfry,a nice old fashioned sci-fi action movie,7,16 November 2007,"Yes, some of the effects (especially the robot ""Box"", whose arms look like conventional heating ducts) are extremely ""dated""  but everything about the film is ambitious including those effects. The story is from a novel by celebrated sci-fi mainstays William F. Nolan (""Trilogy of Terror"") and George Clayton Johnson (""Twilight Zone"", ""Star Trek"") and at least some of the ideas from the book seem to be present here, because the film represents old-school sci-fi of the ""golden age"" variety, the kind of thing that wouldn't be out of place in the pages of ""Galaxy"" or ""Astounding SF."" It's a ""dystopia"" story that shows signs of its lineage from Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World""  Logan 5 (Michael York) is a cop in a domed city where everything sexual and physical is available for the taking, with a catch  at the age of 30 each person has to go to a weird arena where they undergo a ceremony designed to potentially reincarnate them as a new life form. Logan's job is to hunt down people who become ""runners"" and attempt to flee the city to ""Sanctuary"" instead of going through the ritual. After being sent on a mission to destroy Sanctuary by the city's authoritarian central computer (shades of Godard's ""Alphaville"" and Lucas' ""THX-1138""), Logan begins to suspect that his life might not be as perfect as it seems.The early parts of the film are very striking, the best in the film. I liked how we first met Logan 5 and his friend Francis (Richard Jordan) in a kind of sterile maternity ward  clearly despite his protests Logan has some interest in the concept of posterity and reproduction. We see how he and his friends hunt the runners in a decidedly sadistic way, and how casual sex is available at the push of a button. Then we see the people whose time is up don weird masks and robes and float to the ceiling in the ritual  very striking compositions here, although the way the scene was edited together with the crowd's cheers made it seem as if they're at a gladiator event cheering for people's deaths instead of religious supplicants at a ritual, as they are intended. Also I'm not completely sure if Logan was supposed to come off as quite as much of a fascist as he does here, with his gleeful face and blithe attitude about sex but then again maybe he is. There's definitely a more complex character arc than you would see in most sci-fi/action movies these days. I liked how the relationship with Jessica (Jenny Agutter) was explored as a counterpoint to his friendship with Francis as he moves towards a greater understanding of his situation and, perhaps, the human condition. Peter Ustinov acts as the spokesman of the human race in the role of ""Old Man"", who Logan and Jessica meet in a ruined District of Columbia that reminds any semi-alert viewer of ""Planet of the Apes."" I didn't like how his character was written, quite a bit too obvious and kind of annoyingly meandering. In fact the script in general was not very strong, although the actors did the best they could with what they were given. The story as a whole starts to get bogged down just after the scene with ""Box"" where it's revealed that there really is no Sanctuary. This finally confirms for Logan, also, that the computer that runs the domed city is not infallible.As far as the effects, this is the subject of much debate concerning the film. I have mixed feelings about the use of miniatures in the film; it's a beautiful set and I get a kick just out of looking at it, but even considering 1976 effects there are problems with the set that could have been solved with a bit more thinking. For example it's an extremely bad idea to integrate water with your miniatures as they have done here since water immediately betrays the differences in scale. If they were going to use water at the very least they should have made sure that the water was completely placid because any wave action will ruin the shot. The ""Box"" as stated above was just a horrible costume/animatronic, although the idea is still good enough to carry the scene IMHO. However some of the effects in ""Logan's Run"" are definitely state-of-the-art for the mid 70s, particularly the use of video effects in scenes like the ritual and when Logan and Jessica are going up in the elevator to the upper levels (just before they reach Box). Also the matte work in the film was all excellent top of the line stuff. The sets are mostly very interesting architectural works from around the Dallas/Fort Worth area that are dressed up with bizarre objects like the giant silver hand with a red crystal in the center of the palm.This is a kind of sci-fi film that you really don't see any more  with plenty of action and sexuality to distract the eye and plenty of ideas to chew on as well. What's interesting about the film from a philosophical standpoint is how blind Logan and the others are to the ramifications of the situation. That's why his speech to the people in the plaza couldn't sway them; like Logan they had to see the outside and the Old Man for themselves. And none of them have any idea about the negative effects of aging, which is quite charming. I think the overall idea is to poke holes in the idea (which had great currency in the late 60s when the source novel was written) that ""youth culture"" and ""free love"" could save humanity from all of its problems. This could have been a painful pedantic film if the film-makers hadn't had the good taste to never verbalize this film but to simply let the audience soak up the realization.",Logan's Run
52,jzappa,I Guess Life Really Does End at 30,8,13 July 2011,"Hollywood took advantage of the increasingly youth-driven audience demographics in the late 1960s and '70s with countless movies, but most directly and conspicuously was arguably Logan's Run. Nowadays, the movie's nonconformist themes may almost seem too basic, but in the '70s, cinema was all about revolution. It's about another one of those monumental, self-propagating domed cities we're all listed to start living in 300 or 400 years from now, governed by a female voice that may or may not be a supercomputer. This movie is set in a future as envisioned by the disco era, a style so beloved by its followers they must've seen it as prophetic. If you're thinking there'll at some point be a compulsory shot of a well-known Earth landmark now derelict, you are sure enough right.Michael York is Logan 5, a government button man in a control force called Sandmen who, much like the Sonderkommandos in Nazi concentration camps, acquire utmost social bonuses in return for imprisoning or incinerating any ""runners,"" old people of thirty who attempt to escape from state-required execution. Indeed, a youth-oriented world these people inhabit. Crystals entrenched in their hands vary in color with the fleeting years. The joke at the heart of the story is: Life ends at thirty, literally. Everyone is beautiful, every need is accommodated.You enter a ceremony called Carousel, a dig at organized religion, in which you and others too old to live stand in a massive wind tunnel, get siphoned off to the ceiling, and blow up as your friends applaud. It's held that those who are thusly vaporized are reincarnated. The problem is, Logan is quickly advancing thirty himself, because of a particular assignment his mystifying leaders give him, and he soon has misgivings. Accompanied by a defiant Jenny Agutter, Logan chooses to flee for good to a mysterious, legendary place known as Sanctuary, past the arched ramparts of their sterilized metropolis.The miniature sets and models don't---can't---look that stunning by our modern CGI standards. Still, they complete a picture. Like the first Terminator film, less than state-of-the-art visual effects are almost more evocative of the state of mind out of which the film was borne than the antiseptic CGI of today. The introductory sequences in the totally insulated municipality are surprisingly absorbing, almost more for the astoundingly modern sound of the score, the city seeming like one of today's standard shopping plazas, and, remarkably, the hairdos of three hundred years from now look just like those worn forty years ago. People sport the guideline leotards and miniskirts, and coast around vast interior spaces. They don't appear to eat anything, while they drink stuff that's ostensibly nourishing, and when they want sex they simply link themselves to a teleporting computer dating service and occur in one another's bedrooms.York and Agutter traverse an irrigation system and encounter other sandmen. Richard Jordan costars as Logan's pal and fellow hitter, who determinedly chases him as he runs. We also find Farrah Fawcett-Majors included in the cast as an air head, and Peter Ustinov steals the entire film toward the midsection as a doddering old man. This is all well and good, though never do I gain any patent understanding of why this social order must operate as it does. Overpopulation doesn't look like an issue. And there's a chrome-laminated android who amasses humans in an ice cavern for no clear reason. But hey, it's post-apocalypse. So, you know, there. Regardless, however, it's a proficiently paced story with a distinct sense of threat.",Logan's Run
53,jamesrupert2014,Epic 1970's science-fiction adventure that has not aged well,6,3 September 2019,"Life is idyllic but ends at 30 unless you are renewed in 'Carrousel', or so you are told by the computer that runs the city. Enforcement falls to the Sandmen, of which Logan is one, until the computer forces him to be a runner, to leave the domed city, to find 'sanctuary'. The lavish chrome-and-Plexiglas interiors of the domed city look like big-budget (sometimes) descendants of '60s Italian space-opera and, while some of the special effects (such as post-apocalyptic D.C.) are effective, others, such as the ludicrous ""Box"" the robot (a chrome-plated Roscoe Lee Browne) are, and probably were, laughable. Like the future in the original 'Battlestar Galactica' (1978), Logan's world looks very much like the 1970's (especially the hair), which contributes to the satire on youth/mall culture but is hard to reconcile with the dystopian story (compared, for example, with the imagery in George Lucas' bleak 'THX-1138' (1971), which follows a similar story). Michael York is not overly convincing as a 'licenced to kill' cop 200 years into the future. Jenny Agutter is scenic but bland as the hapless Jessica 6, and the usually great Peter Ustinov is wasted as a doddering old man who lives outside the domes. The plot makes little sense, and the ending is abrupt and unsatisfying. The 'futuristic look' of the film was obsolete as soon as Star Wars (1977) forever changed the genre, and neither the story nor the acting can buoy up what was essentially a special effects picture. Lightweight fun but anodyne, and likely now watchable only by fans of the genre, the film deserves credit for attempting to put the future on screen but fails miserably when attaching those images to an engaging and coherent story.",Logan's Run
54,Polaris_DiB,To Brave New World what THX 1138 was to 1984,7,30 September 2008,"Ah, 70s science fiction... ridiculous costumes, campy visual effects, social commentary... and an underlying weirdness you just can't ignore. Logan's Run is something like THX 1138, only to Aldous Huxley's Brave New World instead of Orwell's 1984. And in the words of the character Logan himself, ""It all made sense until Box..."" In the future, mankind survives in a mall-like bubble of society that entirely subsists off of pleasure and materialism. Everyone is forced to die at the age of 30, basically to prevent the knowledge of suffering from getting into their minds. Those who do not want to die at 30 are ""runners"" that get tracked down by ""sandmen"" who blast them with what essentially amounts to flare guns. Despite this, the walls are not TOO scorched with spent rounds, and most people go on happily. Unfortunately for the status quo, this world is a lie and not everyone is happy, resulting in one particular sandman, the eponymous Logan 5, to have to become a runner himself.There are some pretty bizarre scenes in the lieu. The whole rite of the carousel is actually quite disturbing if you think about it. An entire quadrant of the city is filled with derelicts and gangmembers, and of course this part is the one called ""The Cathedral"". On the other hand, there's visual candy as well, with superb modeling for the cityscapes and, yes, Jenny Agutter in a miniskirt that only gets more revealing as it slowly falls apart over the course of the movie.Unlike THX 1138, Logan's Run doesn't end upon successful exit of the city; that's only the first half. Afterward the audience is treated to a gorgeous vision of the empty and abandoned Washington D.C. The movie kind of drags at this point, but is made up for mostly by the disturbing visions of American landmarks in various states of decay. When all else fails, science fiction's greatest asset is the ability to displace the audience with what they feel are familiar landscapes--just look at Planet of the Apes or 28 Days Later...This is a very enjoyable movie, nonetheless. People who like the fact that Star Wars is a Campbellian construction of the Hero's Journey should definitely check this movie out--it might as well have been the primary source for George Lucas' later work. And for science fiction fans as a whole, it's a classic example of the form.But MAN, was that robot and the ice cave WEIRD.--PolarisDiB",Logan's Run

When one of the exterminators gets a mission to investigate matters outside their society, he's selected as next up for extermination. This movie is directed by Michael Anderson (Around the World in 80 Days) and stars Michael York (Cabaret), Jenny Agutter (An American Werewolf in London), Farrah Fawcett (Charlie's Angels) and Richard Jordan (Dune). The storyline, settings, backdrops and premise for this movie is very entertaining and well done. How they built the sets for this in the 70s is unfathomable. The special effects, costumes and props were excellent. I also loved every primary and sub plot. The premise is well presented. The cast delivers excellent performances and York was perfect as Logan.

In order for Logan to infiltrate the underground Runner refuge known as Sanctuary, the society's mother computer, unbeknown to all others, advances Logan's life-clock, and so Logan suddenly becomes a Runner himself.Jenny Agutter portrays Jessica 6, the young woman who decides to accompany Logan, whilst Richard Jordan ('The Hunt For Red October,' 1990) is Francis 7, the former Sandman friend of Logan, who must now track him down and ""terminate"" him.The special effects, one year before George Lucas' 'Star Wars' was to grace our screens, are excellently done, though some of the model-work of the Dome City is a bit transparent. As a sci-fi film, it is crucial that 'Logan's Run' is not taken too seriously. Though a few of the scenes could be described as a bit cheesy, it is a lot of good fun. Peter Ustinov's (""Quo Vadis"", 1951) small but very important appearance later in the film was a pleasure to watch.Also, I can't be the only person to have noticed some very large similarities between 'Logan's Run' and Michael Bay's 2005 film 'The Island.' Whether any such inspiration has been acknowledged by the makers of the latter I cannot say, though it does help with my recommendations.

The cast is strong, with Michael York believably bridging the gap between Logan's initial arrogance and flippancy and his altruistic turn as he learns the truth about the system he's sworn to uphold.

People were actually expected to use their imaginations a bit back then.Michael York did OK but seems to have disappeared since then, which is OK. But the most striking thing was the beauty of Jenny Agutter. She was absolute eye candy in this one. She's been in a lot of films, but I think she never got the recognition (or the starring roles) she deserved.POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD: The ending made me sort of wonder what would happen later, after the movie ended. With the utopian/dystopian city/society destroyed, what would happen to the people? They were so pampered, it seems that they would be uniquely unsuited for living off the land. The toughest and smartest among them would be able to live past thirty, but it seems to me that the vast majority of them would be likely to die well before reaching that age.Anyway, this film was still enjoyable, for those who like sci-fi, and is well worth a rental.",Logan's Run
60,barnabyrudge,"Effects may seem dated, but story is rather fascinating and briskly told.",7,20 January 2005,"Logan's Run is an under-rated and very clever science fiction film which had the misfortune to be released just a few months before the emergence of Star Wars. As a result, the astonishing special effects in Star Wars made Logan's Run appear technologically rather primitive, and the film subsequently became a forgotten piece. It's sad that it happened that way, because Logan's Run has a thought-provoking story, full of imaginative ideas.In the future, people live in a huge dome, enjoying a hedonistic and liberated existence until they reach their 30th birthday. At this point in their life, they are sent to a special arena and forced to enter the ""Carousel"" - a sort of Russian Roulette-style event with laser guns. Occasionally, people who are scared by the prospect of entering the Carousel attempt to run away from the dome. A crack unit of hunters are employed to track down and kill these aptly-named ""runners"". The hunters are known simply as ""sandmen"". Two of the best, most ruthless sandmen are Logan (Michael York) and Francis (Richard Jordan). However, Logan is fast approaching his 30th birthday and is beginning to worry about his likely death in the Carousel (he has noticed that no-one who enters the Carousel arena ever survives). Logan decides to become a runner. He flees from the dome, accompanied by a young woman named Jessica (Jenny Agutter). Francis is the sandman assigned to pursue and terminate his former colleague, but when the chase leads to the outside world and the discovery of a lost civilisation where people could apparently live to become old and wrinkled, it becomes increasingly obvious that the dome and the concept of ""Carousel"" may not be all that it seems.....In the original novel by William F. Nolan, the age of Carousel was 21, but here it has altered to 30 (apparently because no-one in Hollywood was comfortable with actors under 21 performing some of the film's brief but revealing nude scenes). Otherwise, this is a reasonably close adaptation of the story. The film is full of fascinating possibilities about how future society may evolve, wit thoughtful beliefs, values, customs and costumes on display. It is also a brisk tale, expertly scripted by David Zelag Goodman (screen writer of Straw Dogs) and very tidily directed by old-pro Michael Anderson. The action is exciting, but the film doesn't content itself with being just a sci-fi actioner: it also attempts to explore the ins and outs of an alternative social structure, and the dangers of the powers-that-be telling us when to live and when to die. A remake is imminent, but other than brushing up the special effects it's hard to see how they'll improve upon the original.",Logan's Run
61,juneebuggy,Nobody grows old,7,24 June 2020,"I remember seeing this I when I was young and my mind was blown. I thought it was awesome. Well in my rewatch (many, many) years later I wouldn't quite call it awesome.

Farrah Fawcett, the hair, the clothes, the tin foil robot, the weird Renewal ceremony.The story itself still feels fresh and is full of unique ideas, along the lines of The Handmaids Tale or The Island.

62,slokes,A Film Crying Out For Renewal,4,7 March 2004,"""Logan's Run"" was one of those touchstone moments for 70s teens and pre-teens like me, presenting a society where people are ritually killed at 30 to keep the population steady inside a domed city in the 23rd century. The concept of no life after 30 is what registers with most people who know about this film at all, but those who saw it when it was in theaters, particularly us young and impressionables, never forgot the scene in which we see the process of the city's 30-nothings being ritually exterminated in a ceremony called Carousel.Watching the Carousel sequence today might cheat the effect: It comes off as some kind of bug-zapper ballet with a disco ball at the top. But the way these people stripped to form-hugging bodysuits as they floated and cartwheeled to the ceiling, arms upraised to invite the explosions that ripped their bodies apart, was mind-blowing at the time in an almost ""Saving Private Ryan"" way. To add to the effect, the ritual is performed in an arena packed with cheering spectators, blood-drunk citizens of this city whose own dates with Carousel are soon approaching. The false belief behind Carousel is the notion that they may be ""renewed,"" reborn again inside the domed city to enjoy another 30 years of what amounts to a consequence-free lifestyle.It's a sort of concept that can go in many directions. I figured when I saw the movie they were ragging on the life-after-death notions I was taught every Sunday at church, with ""Renewal"" being Heaven and all that. But looking back at it now, you can see the finger more directly points at the materialist trappings of life in the 1970s, with Renewal representing the sort of formless belief in reincarnation espoused by New Age types. The ""death by 30"" ideal fits in perfectly with the youth culture prevalent then and more so now. The city's interior looks like a mall, and in fact was shot in one, the Apparel Mart in Dallas, but that only strengthens the concept. While the dystopian notion of the future represented in ""Logan's Run"" is in many ways as dated as those futuristic films made in the 1930s showing dirigibles docking on skyscrapers, in some ways the film is quite prescient: People sit at home and dial up sexual interludes with strangers, except in ""Logan's Run"" the bodies are real and not in cyberspace.There's a lot else that's right about ""Logan's Run,"" like the eerie electronic score by Jerry Goldsmith, the set design, and the costumes. The lead actors, Michael York as an appointed executioner or `Sandman' for those fleeing Carousel named Logan 5 and Jenny Agutter as his queasy companion Jessica 6, are solid and seem at ease in their alien environment. Richard Jordan, really shines as Logan's pal turned adversary Francis 7, a fellow Sandman obviously too much in love with his job.But once Logan and Jessica flee the city, we are treated to regurgitated bits of earlier '70s sci-fi flicks like ""Planet Of The Apes"" and ""Soylent Green."" They fight a robot who looks like a silver Coke machine and meet an old man who teaches them life can continue after 30. The pace slows down considerably, with a lot of nature walks and meaningful glances between Logan and Jessica to tell us they are in love. By the time Francis appears to put an end to Logan and Jessica's run, it's too little too late.News is there will soon be a remake of ""Logan's Run,"" which is about time. Everything else from the 1970s seems to have been remade, so why not something that really needs it? One can only imagine how today's technological advances, with CGI and the like, will help considerably. The producers would also benefit from rethinking the film's second half. Either keep L&J in the City of Domes this time, or if they must escape it entirely, give them something better in terms of adventure than skinny-dipping and meeting a cat fancier. I also fondly remember the brief TV series that sprang from the movie, with Logan and Jessica fleeing Francis in a hovercar accompanied by an affable android named REM. Getting REM into the remake would be a smooth move.Returning to the original, it's a great concept with some real entertainment value before it begins to fall apart too obviously. It's a fun kitschy ride that could have been a whole lot more. The opening Carousel sequence still packs a punch, but the rest is a case of diminishing returns.Yet I still enjoy this movie, and there's a chance you might, too. It's not great cinema, or even good, but like the decade it sprang from, not entirely disposable despite the shallow glitz around it.",Logan's Run

Logan is a Sandman, whose job is to hunt and kill anyone who tries to escape this mandatory euthanasia. When he is given a mission to go undercover as a runner himself, will he go through with it and what will he find ? Based on a novel by William F. Nolan and George Clayton Johnson, this is one several great bleak seventies Orwellian eco-disaster sci-fi movies (see also THX 1138, Soylent Green, Rollerball, etc) which presents all human existence in the future as essentially meaningless and completely controlled. These are all interesting films and the premise of this one is one of the most intriguing, but of course your perception of it depends how old you are. It never quite makes sense to me however - why do the Last-Day people just accept their fate, who controls all the city's systems for power, food, climate, etc, who built it all, and why is everyone so content just to be jaded pleasure-seekers ? I like the idea that once he escapes the city Logan discovers the nirvana of Sanctuary doesn't exist; there's just one old geezer who's a bit batty and quotes T.S. Eliot all the time. The movie would be better if it left it at that, without the standard disaster-and-rebirth finale. It's all good fun though, with bags of wacky ideas, some great action scenes, fantastic art design by Dale Hennesy (who also did sterling work on Sleeper and Young Frankenstein), a tremendous chase sequence in the middle that lasts nearly half-an-hour, a quirky proto-synthesiser score by Jerry Goldsmith, and Jenny Agutter getting wet a lot (which is compulsory viewing where I'm from). I'm ambivalent about the special effects in this movie; they're actually very good but Anderson films them all wrong - for example, the miniature of the city is amazing but shooting it so wide makes it obvious it's a model. For such a huge concept movie the cast is endearingly intimate - it's essentially a four-character drama (one of whom is senile) and Agutter and Jordan are especially good. I like York too, but Logan is a bit of an enigma; I don't really know when, or even if, he decides to rebel and run for real, and what motivates him to do so, but I'm not sure if that's because of the script or the performer. A great, thought-provoking old sci-fi adventure all round though, shot in some great locations all over Texas. Purists please note - TV prints of this movie almost always run a minute or two short, and all the stuff cut out is nudity/sex, notably in the Love Shop and Box/ice-caves scenes. Trivia - Anderson Jr., who plays the wacky laser-surgeon Doc, is the director's son, and Michael York was 33 when he made this movie !",Logan's Run
64,Spleen,The best of the B-movies,8,7 August 1999,"In the future cities have evolved into what appear to be giant shopping malls of the most hideous kind.  This is NOT a dystopian future, in the usual sense.  It is more of a degenerate future ... think of the atmosphere captured on film by ""The Time Machine"" (1960), or in prose by Arthur C. Clarke in ""The City and the Stars"" (okay, you haven't read it - I don't blame you).  It's the kind of society Margaret Mead believed in, where sex is free, no-one does anything much and no-one has any taste.  It's a vision of the future that seems hardly at all dated.  It looks like kitsch now: but then, it's ALWAYS looked like kitsch - that was the whole point.  (Futures designed to look hip and trendy, on the other hand, begin to show their age within months.)The basic gimmick is that no-one lives beyond the age of thirty - those who attempt to do so are viewed as free-riders, much as we view people who cheat on their income tax.  There's much to be said for this view.  Indeed, when the hero, a policeman who has killed many thirty-and-a-day-year-olds, decides that HE wants to live beyond his allotted time, we certainly sympathise; but more because we realise that life in this giant shopping mall is shallow and pointless, than because life in general is precious.This doesn't quite explore all of the questions it raises but that's not it's job.  It's fun to watch and more intelligent than it seems at first glance.  Some of the acting is pretty bad, but we at least get decent performances from Peter Ustinov and Jenny Agutter.

They both go on the run.From here on it gets dafter by the minute. They find themselves in all manner of scrapes, including a frozen world where runners are all encased in corridors of ice and some bizarre robot with reality issues - probably brought about by its premature expulsion from drama school - tries to kill them, but buries itself under an avalanche instead.Eventually, the dithering duo escape to an outside world, which is exclusively populated by Peter Ustinov and a load of cats, who appear to subsist together upon nothing more nutritious than old books.The Great Brain thing is shorted-out and the Bump-'em-off-by-thirty regime overthrown. So everyone gets to grow old. And good luck to 'em, I say; it ain't that much fun! I'd readily trade some time for a tumble or two with Ms Innocence. In fact my conscience wouldn't have been too troubled to whisk up her skirts in 'The Railway Children'.There are a few - a very few - interesting set-pieces and sci-fi gadget props. Some of them look as if they've been dusted-off from an old puppet series called 'Space Patrol', but otherwise the whole production is as insipid as it sounds here. Most blokes watch this movie to see Pretty Jenny - every younger brother's incest fantasy - strutting about in a filmy nothing, and hope for an unedited breeze. The ladies? Dunno what they see in it. A young Farrar Fawcett makes her challenge for top candy (no contest) and one or two other B-listers bank an easy paycheque.If you've had a bad cold recently; you may find it more rewarding to pick your nose instead of watching this piffle.

68,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Logan's Run""- An amusing bit of old-school science fiction. Sloppy and never able to properly explore its lofty themes. But an entertaining enough film.",7,6 March 2017,"Seeing ""Logan's Run"" for (unfortunately) the first time only recently, I was struck but just how divisive an experience the film ended up being for me. I was aware of it, sure. And I knew of the lofty and heady themes it sought to explore with its adventurous tale of an alleged ""utopia"" with a dark side. But I just honestly never got around to it until just a few short days ago. And as I watched it, I definitely could see why it has maintained a strong cult-audience in the forty years that have passed since its initial release. It's a charming little film with just enough elements at play that work that I would give it a recommendation for those interested. But I also saw a fundamentally troubled film that all too often made me shake my head and exclaim out loud ""What were they thinking?!""In the year 2274, mankind has been confined to technological super- domes where people are free to live out their every hedonistic desire throughout their youth in a highly supervised setting. But there's a catch- once one reaches the age of 30, they are to be ""renewed""... essentially murdered by the dome's artificially intelligent computer in hopes of being reborn. However, this artificial ""paradise"" also highly discourages thoughts and actions that are contrary to the fanatical beliefs of the whole. Anyone who tries to escape their pre- determined fate or questions authority are labeled as ""runners"" and are hunted down by the ""Sandmen""- the dome's police force. When Sandman Logan 5 (Michael York) is sent on a mission to track down the mythical ""Sanctuary"", where runners hope to find salvation outside of the dome, he is set on a course that will not only bring him love in the form of runner-sympathizer Jessica 6 (Jenny Agutter), but will also ultimately make him question his blind devotion to the systems at play...I really do have to give the film a lot of credit. For it's time, it was a pretty massive feat in terms of execution and design. While they are often hilariously dated, the effects present are quite fascinating, and it's a lot of fun seeing how director Michael Anderson tried to realize such a specific vision of the future. I also very much enjoyed the performances of all involved. Michael York makes for a wonderfully compelling protagonist, while Aguetter is just fantastic as our supporting lead. Other roles played by the likes of Richard Jordan and Peter Ustinov are ideally cast in their respective roles. In addition, I gotta give it to the film- it holds your interest, and it's never dull nor dreary. There's just enough eye-popping color and adventurous chases to keep you glued to your seat.Unfortunately, the film is just a bit too scatterbrained at times and even quite sloppy in its handling of theme to really hit home. In terms of structure, it's an incredibly uneven affair. Its pacing goes through radical and sometimes jarring turns between the deliberate and the break-neck, a few key sequences felt incredibly out of place (I'm looking at you and your plankton-obsession, ""Box""!), and the third act is just odd and anti-climactic to an extent. It's not poorly made, necessarily... just troubled and desperately in need of a script-polishing that never came. And I was quite let down by just how on-the-nose much of the metaphors and messages presented were. There's some really good, lofty ideas being explored... between the dangers of fanaticism and hedonism gone out of control... to the questionable nature of the idolization of youth... To even some questioning of religious belief. It's just a shame that the subtext was made so blatant in how it is presented.But hey... it's still quite a fun time. Yes, flaws and all, I can't help but give ""Logan's Run"" something of a strong recommendation. It's never quite the contemplative and thoughtful film experience that I think it desires to be. But it's all just so charming and even often thrilling that I don't mind. It's not the type of film to challenge you and make you ponder on heavy topics for days on end. It's a sometimes goofy, oftentimes entertaining and always fascinating little relic that'll deliver some thrills and laughs... and maybe give you a few talking points to bring up with your friends in the days after.I give it a solid but not great 7 out of 10.",Logan's Run
69,mike48128,Needed to be remade: Shoddy special effects. Bad novel adaptation,6,12 June 2012,"In its day, it was considered one of the ""hippest"" sci-fi movies of its time. It is still a lot of fun to watch, but the special effects don't hold up: 1. You can see the ""clear flying-wires"" in the widescreen DVD during ""Carousel."" 2. The city looks like a miniature. (It is.) You can see the overhead lighting glare on the city, which looks like an HO train set. 3. The ""Arcade"" scenes look like they were shot in a shopping mall (they were!). 4. The ""Washington D.C."" sequence is missing something--perhaps more extras or a helicopter (or shuttle) searching for Logan? 5. Costumes and (some) sets look like a cheap ""Star Trek."" 6. The computer room overhead lights ""blink on and off"" for no apparent reason. 7. An ""explosions and fire climax"" which is a typical finish for a sci-fi flick that ""runs out of gas"" at the end.Not very well adapted from a novel in which life ends at 21: 1. There is a lot more sex and drugs in the novel (big deal). 2. The ""cubs"" refer to what has happened to the ""cub scout"" movement which has deteriorated into wild gangs of young kids on ""muscle"" (a speed and strength-enhancing drug). 3. I do not believe that ""Washington D.C."" is in the book, but there are rocket-powered motorcycles, like in Star Wars! 4. At the end of the novel, they take-off in a rocket ship named ""Sanctuary."" Best scenes: ""Carrousel"", ""The New You laser"", ""Box"", ""Interrogation"" (an academy-award special effect). Washington D.C. mattes are great.Warning: Film should be PG-13 for brief nudity and minor violence. Not for very-young kids, as some scenes have a nightmarish quality to them.Be sure that your copy is widescreen.

70,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Spectacular Movie!,10,6 September 2014,"In the future, a world exists where humans rely on machines for everything, living in a domed city where life is all fun and games... until they are sent off to die in front of spectators. Most residents of this city consider this process 'renewal"", as their replacements are all babies waiting to take their place. However, their bodies are sent off to a robot that freezes them and sends them back to the city as food, when plankton from the sea stopped coming. A Sandman, somebody who kills people who threaten the city, Logan, learns from a strange woman about a mysterious world outside called Sanctuary, and escapes with him on a journey to find this supposed place.Logan's Run has similar themes to Soylent Green and the Omega Man, and also some new themes that are not only disturbing but very possible. One is the idea that each member of society should conform; they all dress alike, have the same ideas and are allowed no originality. Another theme is the idea of treating women as objects; the city has various sectors where men can go for sex and when Jessica, the woman who teams up with Logan, comes to him to ask him what being a Sandman is like, his first statement is, ""Why are you wasting my time? Let's have sex."" The horrifying idea of using the dead for food was also in Soylent Green, but in Logan's Run its even worse, to keep a constant food supply every city resident is forced to die at the age of 30, so that there will be food for everyone.With Logan's Run, it starts off a little boring, you have to give it a chance and watch it with an open mind, because it gets much better once the pair leaves the city and meets ""Old Man"", an elderly recluse living in what was once New York, with his many cats. He is eccentric and grew up in the world we all know now, but overpopulation and disease sent most people packing, and he was left alone for decades. The acting of every character was great, the soundtrack was decent and the plot, based on a sci-fi novel, was very original. Goldsmith, the composer who did the soundtrack for the evil ventriloquist dummy movie Magic (1977), performed the soundtrack to Logan's Run.Logan's Run is an excellent film, both eye-opening and disturbing. Luckily although pollution was mentioned there was no preachy hippie propaganda environmental message, it sticks more with the main plot, and despite it's outdated appearance it has remained just as meaningful today as it always was.",Logan's Run

72,gizmomogwai,A good product of the '70s,8,12 September 2012,"Logan's Run is a dystopian story in which in the future people live in a city where residents aren't allowed to live past the age of 30. Although there's some talk of people getting ""renewed,"" the reality is that they die and if you run, you're hunted down by people called Sandmen and you also die. As a colourful dystopian story from the '70s, Logan's Run has some of the same feel of A Clockwork Orange. Likewise, with its science fiction action it has some of the feel of Star Wars.Leonard Maltin dismissed this movie by writing it had a ""dreary second half."" The comment illustrates why Maltin isn't a great film critic. Actually the whole movie, not just the second half, is kind of dark. People die after short lives (I'm nearing age 30 myself), and then we find out there's no Sanctuary. But the ending is a bit optimistic, as it suggests the people are now aware that they can live to old age. Another criticism I've heard about this movie is that the special effects aren't great, but that's not so important to me for older movies. The city does look at times like a miniature model, but the explosions are probably more convincing than the ones in Star Wars.Probably the real weaknesses are that the Sandmen are all terrible shots with their laser guns and some of the acting isn't quite what it should be. The beginning is kind of hard to follow (what's renewal? How does Carrousel work?). Generally though, Logan's Run worked for me. It has colour, imagination, some spectacle and Jenny Agutter, who gets naked again here, although the sexiest part was probably her first scene where she's wearing a robe that exposes just her hip. Unlike what Maltin says, it's not a bad thing to explore dark themes; life itself is dark. The future depicted by Logan's Run may never come true, but we can still value its message.",Logan's Run
73,vip_ebriega,Standard but entertaining 70's retro sci-fi film.,6,24 May 2008,"My Take: Even dated special effects and pacing can make this look bad. Save George Lucas' STAR WARS, sci-fi movies of the 70's were pretty flashy for their time being, but now they seemed to blah these days. Science fiction has suddenly taken a leap these days thanks to, mainly, big budgets, special effects and top-billing all-star cast. Special effects redefine themselves every time another summer movie is released. These redefinitions makes their grandfathers like LOGAN'S RUN look feeble and obsolete. Still, what great fun film this is. LOGAN'S RUN may seem like outmoded material, and it might probably be, but it has more heart than most recent blockbusters.The film takes place sometime during the year 23rd century (but we all have a more ambitious vision of future centuries by now). The world is now but a dome looming through nothingness. Inside the dome however, is a nearly perfect metropolis, with undeniable pleasure and gee-whiz technology (at least, during the 70's). But with every perfection is a drawback (as we were always warned during every sci-fi movie). When you're 30 years old, you have to give yourself up to a ""perfect"" system called ""Carousel"" and accept a form of rejuvenation.Michael York plays a sort of futuristic cop who tries to stop those who try to escape from ""Carousel"" thinking that it spells doom. Pretty soon, he's turning 30, and he now must run from the system he helped bring up, tagging along a woman (Jenny Agutter) who gets herself involved due to her suspicion. By the mention of this plot line, you know exactly that this is the ancestor of later sci-fi blockbusters as MINORITY REPORT and THE ISLAND. This one is not nearly as innovative and expensive as those recent blockbusters, but comparison isn't required. LOGAN'S RUN, on its own credit, is an entertaining piece of nostalgia. The old-fashioned technological gimmicks reminds us of our own views and imaginations as a kid, and it' quite amusing to see them come to life in this entertaining little film. LOGAN'S RUN is a worthy rental.Rating: *** out of 5.",Logan's Run
74,rockman182,Logan's Run (1976),7,18 February 2017,"Here's a sci-fi film that I have been meaning to catch for a long time. Luckily TCM is doing the 31 days of Oscar films marathon so I can catch up on good stuff I've never seen. Sci-fi's of the past decades are usually great because they are creative and high concept. I know this is based on a novel but I think the film was still pretty great regardless even though some of it was flawed. Logan's Run is a sci fi film that takes place in a dystopian future and I'd have to say this film must have influenced many modern day films.The film is set in a world where people only live until 30. Once they hit 30 they are exterminated. A man known as Logan 5 goes on the run who becomes 30 after a medical procedure goes wrong. He goes on his run with a beautiful compatriot named Jessica 6. The film has futuristic gadgets and concepts and really felt slightly ahead of its time. I say slightly because we started getting a lot of the original sci-fi films around this time. Logan's Run had a few themes I noticed and also a few similarities to some other sci-fi films of the time.The film really reminded me of Soylent Green in the fact that it has a theme of population control through killing off human beings in a ritualistic/efficient way. The film also shared similarities with Planet of the Apes, mostly through the viewing of the desolate ruins of Washington DC. The effects are at times quite dated, which is understandable considering the time. The film does have a few memorable moments and enough romance going for it to keep you interesting.I'd say the first half of the film has a lot going on but its quite interesting but its important to stay focused or get lost. The second half where Logan and Jessica go on the run doesn't always engage but its mostly nice to see the connection between the two. Overall, its quite a fun film with some interesting viewpoints and issues addressed for its time. While effects are dated and the focus isn't always perfect it's a good experience.7.5/10",Logan's Run
75,Benjamin-M-Weilert,The best special effects of 1976.,6,14 March 2020,"In today's landscape of CGI and superb practical effects, it's a little difficult to watch movies like Logan's Run (1976). Sure, there are a few good bits (like dissolving bodies), but there are a lot of effects that look low-budget by today's standards. Wires clearly hold up flying people, a robot is obviously a man in a boxy costume, and a futuristic society seems to be housed in a mid-1980s shopping mall. About the only reason I don't necessarily deem Logan's Run a B-movie fit for a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 ribbing is because it was the best technology they had at the time.Of course, I say this was the best special effects of the day, knowing full well that Star Wars (1977) would come out a year later. If anything, this movie shows the enormous leap in special effects that Star Wars provided the film industry in comparison. And while the plot of Logan's Run is relatively simple, certain elements appear to be pulled from Planet of the Apes (1968). Both seem to show how the future bodes for our society and, more specifically, one that settles on killing anyone over 30 years old.Despite how poorly it has aged, Logan's Run is still a pop culture reference that appears from time to time. From direct references in The Simpsons and Family Guy, the idea of an age limit was also adapted in a slightly different way (to middling success) in In Time (2011). There's no denying its hedonistic appeal, if for no other reason than its ability to show that perhaps we shouldn't trust everything a computer tells us. Of course, the utopian/dystopian dichotomy will always be present in media, but Logan's Run has a reasonably good take on the theme for what it is.The best special effects of 1976, I give Logan's Run 3.0 stars out of 5.",Logan's Run
76,carbuff,"Before modern special effects, you actually needed ideas and plots.",7,28 July 2019,"I saw ""Logan's Run"" when I was a kid and remember thinking it was a great movie, but the question was whether or not it would hold-up over time. So many movies I thought were great when I was a kid in the 1960s and 1970s (such as pretty much any Clint Eastwood or Steve McQueen film) don't seem to have aged well, while others (such as much of Walter Matthau's oeuvre) may be somewhat dated, but have aged into very pleasant nostalgia.In the case of ""Logan's Run"", it cannot be denied that everything about this film from the acting to the sets comes across as unsophisticated and cheesy, yet hidden behind all that coagulated dairy are much more sophisticated ideas than you get in most modern films.For example, tonight it was a choice between streaming ""Logan's Run"" or the ""Fifth Element"" (the latter of which I'd seen some years back but didn't remember very clearly either). ""Logan's Run"" won out, because I just didn't want to sit through another essentially simple-minded, Manichean-plotted film dependent of a messianic character ""To Save The World!"", albeit with outstanding special effects. With regard to fundamental depth of ideas versus special effects, ""Logan's Run"" and ""The Fifth Element"" are basically polar opposites.So as lame as it's production values are compared to modern fare, this film still fully belongs in the group of important Sci-Fi flicks of the 1970s.

In this occasion filmmaker Michael Anderson takes us to the 40th century, to a world where everyone seems to live peacefully and without much troubles. They have only one inconvenient: everyone must be ""renewed"" at the age of 30, which means that they have to die. Obviously not everybody do agree with that rule and a group of people will fight against it and will try to escape.Nowadays ""Logan's run"" looks so ""kitsch"" because of the wardrobe, the special effects, the soundtrack...

If you take the 70's production with a grain of salt what you have is an excellent sci-fi thriller. The movie flies by. It builds and builds and even when we approach the end of the film we only wish it would keep going...keep answering all those questions that go unanswered...which really is the appeal of the film. This is a timeless sci-fi cult-classic. I am very much looking forward to the pending remake, but will be surprised if it is more effective than the original here. While the production values are at times questionable - the film thrives in terms of creating tension, and the pacing is fantastic. It's provocative, and at times quite violent and cruel. 'Logan's Run' delivers with constant thrills and intrigue, but still never gives us all we want... we want more. Films like this one use the unknown of the future to hold the audience in suspense(Much Like Planet of the Apes). We want to know how society evolved, but we are only privy to so much.

The movie is a modernist version of Plato's ""allegory of the cave"" At every turn there are references to Platonic ideas, like children being born without knowing their parents.In 1965, the saying, ""Don't Trust Anybody Over 30"" became popular. The film plays off of that concept, just as the film ""Wild in the Streets"" did. It also captures the revolutionary atmosphere of the 1960's. ""Carousel"" and ""Renewal"" is a thinly disguised satire on the Christian practices and ideas of ""baptism"" and ""rebirth"".From 1968 to 1974, Michael York was in some of the biggest hits of that time period: ""Romeo and Juliet,"" ""Cabaret,"" ""Three Musketeers"" and ""Four Musketeers,"" and ""Logan's Run.""

What made Planet of The Apes so revolutionary is often in places what makes this films so stereotypical.It's not all bad, an excellent supporting performance by Peter Ustinov is the highlight, and I suppose it's harmless enough without ever really lighting up as a sci-fi film.

In the case of ""Logan's Run"", the nearly 'quaint' miniature work is patently artificial, and combined with the 70s hairdos, and 'mall' environment, gives the film a 'retro' feel; fortunately, the story and performances are so terrific that the film is still very entertaining, and has achieved 'cult' status, today.The premise is intriguing; in the 23rd century, civilization has retreated into a computer-controlled, multi-domed city, sealed off from the outside world. Given an impersonal, if hedonistic paradise to live in, there is only one drawback; residents must sacrifice themselves on their 30th birthday, in a quasi-religious ceremony known as Carousel, where, they believe, they might be 'renewed'. A few attempt to escape death, searching for the legendary 'Sanctuary'; the task of executing these 'runners' falls to the 'Sandmen', an elite force of policemen armed with explosive pistols.It's a great life to be a 'Sandman', which friends Logan 5 and Francis 7 (Michael York and Richard Jordan) enjoy to the self-indulgent hilt...until Logan meets Jessica 6 (Jenny Agutter), a beautiful girl wearing the ankh symbolizing an affiliation to the 'runners', who isn't impressed by Logan's nearly 'rock star' status.Logan is secretly assigned by the city computer to find the elusive 'Sanctuary' of the 'runners', and 'aged' to 30, thus giving him an excuse to join them...and making him a 'Sandman' target. The tale then becomes a 'cat-and-mouse' chase, as Logan recruits Jessica's aid, and the pair search for Sanctuary, relentlessly pursued by Francis. Logan discovers that the few runners not dispatched by the 'Sandmen' are executed and frozen by a rather clunky robot, Box (the voice of Roscoe Lee Browne)...after defeating him (rather easily), Logan and Jessica (followed by Francis) break free to the outside world, a wild, untamed wilderness leading to a nearly deserted Washington, D.C., where they meet their first 'old man' (Peter Ustinov), a hermit living alone with a large array of cats. The couple, their relationship deepening to love, must face Francis, and return to the city to expose the fraud that everyone is living under...Casting is EVERYTHING in a movie like this, and the ""Logan's Run"" ensemble is terrific. York, a youthful 34, combines innocence and determination as Logan, and Agutter, 23, is all wide-eyed idealism as Jessica, looking very comfortable being barely dressed through much of the picture. Even better is Jordan, who, at 37, is as convincing a younger man as York, in a far more demanding role. While Farrah Fawcett, 29, in a small role, is more flash than talent, Michael Anderson Jr., 32, is wonderfully menacing as a plastic surgeon. Ustinov, 55, steals the picture, cranky and cantankerous, yet lovable. While one might quibble that a man who could memorize T.S. Elliot should understand the words in the Capitol better, he provides an element of reality and a character audiences can relate to.Jerry Goldsmith's remarkable score is certainly a plus, combining traditional and synthetic music, seamlessly.""Logan's Run"" may not be as flashy or 'cutting edge' as ""Star Wars"", but it is far sexier (with a healthy dose of nudity), more complex, and definitely worth a spot in your film library!",Logan's Run
83,elicopperman,Sci-Fi Marvel from a Different Era,6,8 May 2021,"When you think of sci fi movies that delve into themes of utopian & dystopian societies, one that comes to mind is the 1976 film adaptation of Logan's Run. Made by MGM at a time when the sci-fi genre was getting a rise in popularity, before Star Wars that is, the film was a commercial hit but ended up dividing critics at the time. Now seen as a cult classic, the film is often viewed as a subjective look into the future based on what was perceived in the 1960s and 70s, yet still campy enough to warrant some intrigue. So looking at the film 45 years after its original release, how does it favor today?The film tells the story of Logan 5, a bounty hunter living in a utopian future society facade. On the outside is a dystopia where population and resource consumption are maintained through limiting people by age 30. Having terminated others trying to escape death, Logan is now faced with being hunted on his own mission to destroy a society of runners. Arguably what the film is most well known for is its commentary on hedonism and youth worship believing in lies, in a world where overpopulation is determined through futuristic government regulation no less. While these themes have been pretty common in sci-fi media before and even afterwards, the concept of damaging your free will through manipulative prophecies does give the film quite a horrific identity. Similarly to how immigrants from oppressive societies choose to live in a free land, the runners choosing to live in a peaceful habitat, in this case known as ""Sanctuary"", might be the most timeless quality the film has to offer, especially in today's society of corrupt politicians and millions of people begging for a better tomorrow.However, in spite of the fascinating commentary, what does keep the movie back is its lack of momentum and underdevelopment. It's been said that the original book of Logan's Run explored numerous worlds throughout the future in tackling global societies of tomorrow, yet the movie mostly takes place in a hollow version of our world many years later, thus surprisingly leaving less to the imagination than originally thought. It doesn't help either that the film takes a while to get going in certain scenes, like when Logan meets his bland love interest Jessica 6, or when they meet newer runners and sentient beings, or even when Logan actually attempts to run away from the utopia itself. There are some chilling and heartfelt scenes here and there, especially regarding one particular doctor who is onto Logan, but they end up either going nowhere just to move the plot forward or end up falling short of intrigue. Lastly, out of all the movies with a rushed ending just to save the day, this one might have you rolling your eyes harder than the average movie plot twist.That's not to say the film is without merit, as the film's then expensive budget of $9 million does reflect heavily on screen. In addition to the civilians wearing different colors based on their ages, the technology presented throughout looks so convincing that the film does almost come off as a look into the future with newer adjustments to product placements and cosmetic branding. Some notable special effects highlights include the horrific Carrousel, which used very solid wires to depict levitation, actor Roscoe Lee Brown portraying Box in a very cute albeit creepy robot costume, and a rather innovative hologram making Logan's actor Michael York being the first movie star in history to perform in such a way. Also, the grandiose score by Jerry Goldsmith helps add into the suspense needed for an action-packed adventure like this, and they usually become way more harmonious and enchanting when the film's technology is in use. So even if Logan's Run is more interested in the razzle dazzle than story pacing, at least it offers some worthwhile cinematic presentation into the future.So in the end, while it might not have hit all the marks it could have to stand triumphant in the sci-fi genre, Logan's Run is nevertheless a stylistically stunning look into a future that has literally lost all sense of time and continuity by forcing the inhabitants to die young. It seems that youth culture has grown worse and worse overtime with even today's generation heading into a downward spiral of insanity and failure to connect to the wise. If a cheesy yet thrilling blockbuster movie from nearly fifty years ago can reflect that ideology to a haunting degree, then there's no telling what else could be in store for what's to come.",Logan's Run
84,funtasticfour,Due for a remake!,7,5 May 2019,"I've heard about this movie for years, but only just watched it now. I like the story idea, which I could say isn't original, but back then it probably was. Mostly it holds up pretty well, except for some simple effects. Its a bit longer than it needed to be as well, but overall I enjoyed it, and would love to see it reimagined/updated.",Logan's Run
85,bsinc,"Crude, but entertaining",7,27 January 2003,"This was an enjoyable movie, a bit too long since I was expecting Logan to run (which he does, but for about 20 minutes), but it manages to round itself up nicely. Michael York, who in my mind is a living parody of himself is a very good lead, but the best part is reserved for Jenny Agutter, one of the sexiest women in a 70's movie. She's shaggadyllic, groovy and very very... lovely. Had it not been for her I'd probably give up on this movie after the scene with that robot. But hey, they at least made the city model look believable. NOT!!!!!!!! A very ""different"" score by Williams and a nice plot make ""Logan's Run"" credible, although I can't really imagine why anybody never wondered if the ""outside world"" was still radioactive or whatever. A nice cameo by Ustinov and Fawcet who still shows she never could act. 6/10",Logan's Run

I can't imagine how they improve on the perfection that is Logan's Run with the upcoming remake, but I just pray they don't screw it up like other remakes which shall remain nameless. Now to the classic story of Logan's Run, the cast does a great job, the story is wonderful for a God I hope not future. There are some minor character issues which I won't get into. But for the most part, the best villain of the movie is Box, the crazed robot that thinks he has to freeze anything and anyone that he meets to preserve as food. That is one cool monster robot. The effects were assume for the time period and the acting is perfect. So to cut a long review short, I give it 9 STARS.",Logan's Run
87,michaelarmer,Science Fiction par excellence,9,9 March 2020,"This is an underrated sci-fi film, and its one of my personal favourites.Michael York is excellent as is Richard Jordan, my favourite scene is when Jordan catches up with York and Agutter in the old library, the confused and angry face he pulls is brilliant, its a great shame he passed away in 1993 with a Brain Tumor, a good actor. Jenny Agutter is very good also. With excellent cameos from Peter Ustinov and Farah Fawcett (who has also passed away!), Ustinov is the best actor here and almost steals the show over York, but not quite.The special effects are a bit dodgy but the scenes in the decimated and overgrown city are very good, photography is good. Music is very good, but its the story that makes it and the successful transfer to screen. It is well paced and directed, one of the better quality sci-fi films, although apparently it did not have a massive budget, but as this proves you can still make a great film on a low budget.I have given it a 9 because it is so well made and acted, if the special effects were better I would have given it a 10.",Logan's Run
88,PudgyPandaMan,This movie holds a special memory for me.,6,14 July 2008,"I saw this movie when it was first released in 1976. I was in 6th grade and visiting my grandparents in Indiana (I'm from NC). I begged and begged to let me go see this, as I wasn't usually allowed to see PG movies (but they didn't know this of course). They finally gave in. So in a way, this was one of the first GROWN up movies I got to see. Granted, it's obviously not very racy, but I felt quite proud of seeing it. I was always interested in sci-fi and this certainly fit the bill.I remember loving being transported to a different time and place. Granted, the acting isn't top notch and the sets aren't all that great (especially when viewed now as an adult). But as a kid, I could still find myself wrapped up in the story and rooting for the people to escape such a cold-hearted law of being ""exterminated"" at 30. It definitely has an intriguing storyline and if you come in it not expecting too much, I think you'll find it entertaining.",Logan's Run

This film was filled with random sex and nudity to an extent unheard of for the time(and never topped!).  This movie was a grand experiment that made it passed the censors and should forever have a place in the annals of movie history as a harbinger of things ""as they should have been"" but weren't.If the trend of Logan's run had continued, we probably would have seen full frontal nudity in ""G"" rated films by now.  But, alas, the ""Reverend"" Jerry Falwell, et al, had their way and we are now stuck with the ilk of the ""Lion King"".Jenny Agutter had the perfect physiognomy to lead this revolution, with her girlish face and womanly body and this, no doubt, probably led the censors to relax their standards.I only wish the ""trend"" that could have been set by ""Logan's Run"" would have continued--We needed more films like ""Logan's Run""!",Logan's Run

It is a very good dystopia tale, but mostly it relies on gorgeous special effects (abundant) and sex appeal (supposedly abundant, but I think rather scarce) to drive its themes home. The performances are appropriately campy, so there's no contest from me on that front. What I find the most unnecessary about this movie is the (somewhat) frequent ""outbursts"" of nudity that might be somewhat important, but come at very odd times (""Let's take our clothes off before they freeze""). Peter Ustinov's brief performance as a madder-than-a-hatter old man is amazing, but the comparatively small portion of this movie that needs to be redeemed still lies in limbo in spite of it.

93,CelluloidRehab,29.999 year old male seeks pre-30 year old. Purpose : A ride on the Carousel,9,14 October 2006,"It is sometime in the 23rd century. The survivors of the global holocaust live in an Utopian-like structure (controlled and regulated by computer system) where mankind lives only for pleasure (plastic surgery, sex, drugs, orgy clubs, swinging, etc) separate from the world outside their domed structures.This movie has a significance much apart from many other movies. It was made in the same year as my birth and this day being my year of renewal, marks this as a special occasion. Is it coincidence that a movie about pre-30 year old, was made at the same time? I shall answer that with a resounding NO. It is not coincidence.Logan 5 (Michael York) is a ""Sandman"". He is essentially the enforcer of the new world. A Sandman takes out ""runners""; 30 years old who attempt to flee the festival of Carousel (white robed and hockey-masked 30 year olds with flashing red crystals in their palms, wearing flaming tights underneath their robes, floating towards a white crystal and are eventually vaporized but they call it Renewal). His world changes when Logan meets Jessica 6 (the lovely and scantily clad Jenny Agutter) and her Ankh necklace. The computer informs Logan that Ankh is synonymous with Sanctuary (the place of refuge for the runners, most likely outside the domes). The computer expires Logan's life clock (flashing red palm crystal) to help him to infiltrate the underground and take it out. His mission becomes increasingly difficult because : 1) People are wary of others and are hateful of the Sandmen (only members of this society dressed in all black)2) Francis 7 (Logan's best friend and also a Sandman) discovers Logan's run and pursues to terminateThe future world looks much like a mall. Everyone is young, scantily dressed in bright colors, plastic surgery is quite common, everyone likes to work out and exercise and the people have as much depth as cardboard cut outs. Farrah Fawcett's character (Holly 13) is a perfect indicator of the depth of people of this world. She actually has to be told her lines mid-movie. The movie is quite dated in terms of special effects (even for the time). Future world is a model of domed structures connected by a toy monorail system. The interiors are mall-like and have a 70's perspective of the future (lots of glass, mirrors, and the heavy use primary colors). The clothing is also very 70's like. The movie proceeds in typical fashion of that era's ""catastrophic future"" genre (Planet of the Apes series, Omega Man, etc). With all this dated material this movie still manages to maintain integrity through the story (are you reading this George L ?). It is the same reason why 2001 continues to be an important and relevant piece of science fiction almost 40 years after it was made. The movie has the underbelly element of Big Brother, the foolishness and folly of youth, dogma and doctrine, and the exaggeration of the degradation of human behavior through lack of want. The movie is not bogged down by the social questioning nor does it dwell in the action. It is a perfect amalgam of science fiction, social commentary, action and adventure. This is a must see for science fictions fans. Growing old is nothing to fear, especially when you have Sanctuary. See you in Washington, D.C. when I'm 31.",Logan's Run
94,peterfmodel,The movie is a lot better than the book,8,14 August 2019,"When movies are created from a book, often the result is less than successful. This is the exception and the movie is far more entertaining and coherent than the novel. The acting is good and while it has that 70's feel to it, that is all part of the charm. The end seems a bit rushed, but nonetheless achieves its objective. Michael York does an excellent job portraying Logan and Jenny Agutter is a real honey, as well as being an excellent actress. This is another of those rare movies I can re-watch, so do yourself a favour and give it a try. Just try and see past the 70's bling.",Logan's Run
95,eddax,"Interesting concepts, loopholed story, poor set and effects",7,17 November 2002,"I can't believe this movie received an Special Achievement Award Oscar for visual effects. People then must've been blinded by the flashy lights and skimpy skirts (what is it with the Christmas colors motif?). I'm sure the Academy regretted their decision the next year when the immensely superior Star Wars was released. Granted the art direction and special effects teams had a tough job on their hands - creating a futuristic city with little resemblance to the now - and they do a good decent job at times, but many details still smack of ineptitude and incompetence. For example: external shots of the city are clearly of models; when people levitate, you can see the wires; when shots are fired at the ground by flare-like guns, you can see the line of flash powder that ignites; and oh god, the robot looked even faker than the Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz, if that's possible.The screenplay for Logan's Run - originally a novel - is ambitious. It succeeds on some levels but fails on others. It manages to give us a good feel of the 23th century city life, a life not unlike the one in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World - a world of conformists, a section of savages, a few questioning individuals, and a whole new system of doing everything, including an intriguing method of procuring sexual partners for a surprisingly ambisexual society.Unfortunately this movie fails plot-wise. The problem with movies that take place in completely new worlds is that the duration of the movies have to be divided between introducing the audience to the world and actually telling the story. With books, it is more easily done. Hence, even at a lengthy two hours, this movie still has loopholes left gapingly open (like the robot, what's that about?).Michael York is a surprisingly charismatic and dashing lead, something you wouldn't have been able to tell from his roles as Basil Exposition in the Austin Powers movies. 7/10",Logan's Run

You wouldn't think this had a feature film budget.Ultimately the apparent utopian society with a very dark underside is Trekian too, as is the end which is both silly (a computer error destroying the entire facility) and actually quite dark-- most of these people from the city are going to die.But it's quiet a fun movie and well worth watching.",Logan's Run
97,Thrashman88,Interesting pre-STAR WARS sci-fi!,7,15 July 2006,"LOGAN's RUN tells the tale of Logan 5, a ""sandman"" (or a policeman) living in an Utopian society, where everything is nice and clean in an underground city covered by a huge dome. The trouble is, no one in this city gets to live past their 30th birthday. People who are approaching that age partake on a ceremony, where they believe they will be ""renewed"" or have a life beyond. One day, Logan is sent on a secret mission by the city's central computer, which is to find the ""sanctuary"". People who try to escape this city want to get to this sanctuary and it's up to Logan to find out if this place exists or doesn't but not before he's betrayed by the same computer. He befriends Jessica, a young woman who doesn't believe in the ""renewal"" thing and who also believed that there was something beyond the city's dome. LOGAN'S RUN is the perfect example of pre STAR WARS science fiction and the reason why Lucas's space opera made this 1976 film decidedly archaic overnight. Nevertheless, LOGAN'S RUN is a surprisingly entertaining movie. A bit uneven at parts and with some major explanations never addressed, LOGAN'S RUN still made for an entertaining 2 hours. Jenny Agutter is hella sexy as Jessica and Michael York's portrayal of Logan is believable enough. The late Richard Jordan gives an energetic performance as Francis, the sandman who is out to get his ex buddy Logan and Jessica for escaping the dome. Most of the Special Effects do look extremely dated and very ""70's"". Still, the production design is good and Jerry Goldsmith's score mixes traditional orchestra with what sounds like early 80's arcade game noises. I haven't read the book this movie was based upon. With that in hand, we never know who's behind this Utopian society or what controls them and who established the ""death at 30"" and ""renewal"" philosophies. By the same token, we never know what drives people to run away from what otherwise seems like the perfect society. More recent pictures like THE ISLAND (the 2005 movie, not the Michael Caine one)look as a virtual remake of LOGAN'S RUN. Other movies like TOTAL RECALL and even THE MATRIX seem to have taken cues from LOGAN'S RUN here and there.I would love to see an actual remake of LOGAN'S RUN.

104,Aussie Stud,"Time hasn't been kind to this ""futuristic"" society.",5,23 January 2005,"""LOGAN'S RUN"" is by all means, a great concept. The idea of a futuristic Utopian society where life ends at the age of 30, only to be renewed again sounds pretty neat. The story/idea is excellent.Michael York and Jenny Agutter play the leads in perfect straight-to-video fashion (as can only be expected). Richard Jordan as an assassin to take out ""runners"" (ie. people who turn 30 and decide to run for their lives) adds a nice blend of evil. Farrah Fawcett turns up in a tiny role as what else, a plastic surgeon's ditzy blonde assistant! The acting is sub-par save for Sir Peter Ustinov, who could fascinate me just by reading from the phone book, adds heart and comic as an old man born and raised in the ""outside world"".Now as for the special effects. Well, maybe back in 1976, audiences might have thought people walking around in togas and leotards with seventies hairstyles could have passed for a society living in the 23rd Century... but these days, it just looks funny. Actually, most of the ideas for special effects in this movie are not just outdated, but they actually look REALLY outdated.The exterior shots of the city look like a 70's architectural display model of a cheesy golf club. Most of the furniture look like it came directly out of a K-Tel infomercial. The interior shots of the ""Arcade"" look like something that could be found in any 70's shopping mall, from the twin escalators to the box-container elephant-ear plants. And how about the ""Carousel""? Well, it's supposed to be some sort of an arena where the same extras sit down and do that power thing by pumping their fists in the air, cheering and clapping while a group of people who have just turned 30 get lifted off the ground via pull-strings and float towards a funky-looking chandelier as they explode in a shower of sparks and flames.Spears with glow-sticks on the ends. A talking computer with lettering font long outdated since the late 70's. Fawcett wearing a sequined green Peter Pan outfit. York's face appearing in holographic mirrors shouting dialogue in slow motion! What more could one ask for! It gets even funnier. When York and Agutter encounter ""Box"", an evil robot that looks like a big upright vacuum cleaner with clothes dryer exhaust pipe arms and Christmas tree lights on its body, you won't be able to stop yourself from laughing uncontrollably. My sides were still hurting after watching ""Box"" chase the two characters while flailing its arms around in the air brandishing what looks to be a pilot lighter! The only really good scenes were the shots of Washington D.C. covered with creepers and vines. An apocalyptic vision of a world fallen by the stupidity of man (as always).The action scenes were actually alright. Watching two people on the run can always be fun, no matter what the setting. But watching them dodge exploding squibs that look like chintzy fire crackers as they get ""fired upon"" by angry Sandmen was pretty funny. The funniest scene was seeing Fawcett getting ""blown away"" by a cloud of smoke as a wall gets broken into. And who could forget the hilarious scene in the plastic surgeon's office where the machine goes bonkers causing someone to die from thin red lines of paint.All in all, ""LOGAN'S RUN"" is a fun movie to watch. The story is captivating. You don't need to care about the acting - all the producers did was cast a bunch of people with pretty faces and not much acting range. One can always count on Michael York for various occasions of over-acting in scenes that don't require it. But watch for the special effects. They haven't held well over time, which now make them prime and ideal targets for jokes and laughter. And of course, stay for the late Sir Peter Ustinov, who is always a delight to watch in almost anything.My Rating - 7 out of 10",Logan's Run
105,koofasa,This movie holds up after 45 years,8,18 April 2021,I saw this movie at age 15 and now that I'm 60 I wanted to see it again. It shows how easily people can be duped into believing the most ridiculous things if they aren't allowed to explore their curiosity. People are living under a dome run by computers. They live lives of leisure while waiting to be recycled at aged 30. They live naively without social structures required by society. There are no families and people are raised without parents. They don't even know what love is. I think the book probably explains why Logan is sent on his run as the movie leaves a lot out. The special effects are extremely hokey but it was the 1970s after all and this movie was considered big budget for the time. I'm glad I got to see it again.,Logan's Run
106,patryk-czekaj,Behind an intriguing idea a decent amount of unexpected laughs,7,30 June 2012,"Logan's Run is yet another fantastic movie that presents an interesting vision of the post- apocalyptic future of our world. It may be clichéd at times, but it certainly is able to astound with the fabulous visual effects and science fiction imagery of the most futuristic sort. What distinguishes this particular film from many other science fiction projects is the fact that it somehow seems purposefully (or not?) humorous and ironic in its narrative and storytelling manner. And it definitely doesn't worsen the provided experience, as all the marvelously comic aspects seem much more appealing when the viewer takes the whole idea less seriously. In the 23rd century, in an ostensibly idyllic society, where every desire could be fulfilled right away, people live in happiness and peace. However, there is one major drawback to all this: people must finish their lives when they turn 30, in a quasi-religious ceremony called carousel (notice the great special effects in this sequence), which mysteriously incinerates all the participants. Those who vapor are later said to be reborn anew. That means there aren't any old people. There are, of course, some individuals who don't necessarily agree with the rituals and try to run; hence they are called Runners. This is where Logan (Michael York) shows up and uses his skills. He is a 'Sandman', a person, who is responsible for eliminating all those trying to escape. Yet, due to a crazy turn of events and an item that wasn't meant to get into his hands, he himself becomes a Runner and is sent on a mission to find a place called 'Sanctuary'. In the process he has to infiltrate an underground army of dangerous fugitives. So Logan runs. And along with him runs Jessica (Jenny Agutter), one of the opponents of the system. After a humorous couple of scenes (specifically the ones in the frozen cave, with a little robot fellow called Box) they finally wound up outside. After a touching moment of holding hands and looking at the sun, they discover the runs of Washington and meet an older man (Peter Ustinov). How overwhelmed they are by all the outer-world details, such as tombstones, animals, white hair and wrinkles. In the distinctly Utopian ending, they go back to convince the cut off community that the purpose of life is to grow old and die when the time comes.The idea is fresh, interesting, and cleverly utilized as the storyline goes. Due to a high budget, the costumes, special effects and visuals are stunning (even nowadays). The acting is somehow fitting, and it is always good to see the great Peter Ustinov make an appearance, this time as a stammering remainder of the extinct civilization. All in all, with its bold quantity of clichés, Logan's Run certainly offers huge amount of fun, and presents an intriguing idea about the future of mankind. It shows that sometimes what's above the surface, on the outside (as in 'Allegory of the Cave'), might seem too frightening for some people, and they simply can't allow themselves to think that there can possibly be more to life.",Logan's Run
107,headly66,Set phasers to maximum CHEESE!!!,3,22 May 2009,"I loved this movie when I was a kid, being ten at the time I didn't know any better but the film still contains elements that give a certain cool feel to it. The sets, costumes and acting are all very sloppy but that was sort of the norm with these types of films in the 70's. I would love to have seen someone better direct this, it could have been exceptional in the right hands.What's with the guns the sandmen have, could they be more inaccurate and less threatening, only a year later we have Star Wars great light sabers and guns, but these are just pointless, someone had the great idea to create flaming firearms but it just doesn't translate well on film and you can see where the next explosion is going to happen a mile away.The opening is just plain bad, the crappy costumes, 70's haircuts 300 years in the future, the shopping mall-like atmosphere, and for Christ sake who built that Habitrail city, it might be the worst modeling I've ever seen. The very visible wires during carousel is sad film making. But by far the worst scene has to be their venture into ""cub"" land, it makes no sense that these kids live there, what do they even eat, it has nothing to do with the plot, and it seemed right out of a bad TV pilot or a Star Trek episode from ten years before.And then there is the most atrocious special effect of all time when the ""I'm gonna freeze you sucker"" robot gets blown up and they decide to just overlay fake flying ice cubes, it makes Earthquake look state of the art.Once they get outside, nothing happens, I mean nothing. They meet up with the old guy who can only say ""I don't know"" to every question. You would think that a guy alone and living in the Library of Congress would at least have read a book or two, he can memorize cat poems and every cat's name but can't remember HIS name or how old he is or what happened to all of society? Why at the end does the entire city begin to blow up because of a computer malfunction? Is the city built out of propane and dynamite? On the good side there are certain scenes that are well done, when they go to see the computer thing in the beginning I am reminded of Star Wars sets, too bad they could not have this quality throughout.Alas, I fondly remembered this from my youth but it has aged terribly and has to be one of the worst of the era.",Logan's Run
108,mgruebel,Cult classic with longevity,7,12 February 2019,"I am one of those people who saw Logan's Run in the 1970s, so perhaps that makes my view rosy. But I saw it as recently as 2019 and still enjoyed it again.The story is about humanity enclosed in a domed city long after a war made the outside go afoul. Everything is run by an AI system that puts anyone over 30 through a 'renewal' ceremony (i.e. kills them off so they are replaced 1:1 by a baby grown in an artificial womb). Sandmen take care of 'runners' who try to escape the city once they reach 30 years of age.One thing that immediately sets this film apart is the loving effort and detail put into sets and special effects. Yes, they are pre-Star Wars (and far from 1969's 2001) miniature effects, but the scenes of people on walkways while monorail trains rush over their heads, or the 3-D light show that plays during renewal, or the beautiful matte work on a destroyed Washington, D.C. later in the film are real works of art. This is true even if the supposed helicopter fly-over right at the start looks like a camera hovering over a miniature, unlike similar effects of X-wing fighters going into the Death Star Trench, which were done with a computerized camera and a much better choice of lighting and f-stops.The characters in this film all have a childlike affectation to them, and this could get annoying. However, it suits the premise well: humans coddled by an AI and left without any substantial education so they don't start asking tough questions (or 'be too smart' like a little rogue girl in the middle of the film) would pretty much behave like sheep content to wallow in sex and parties while being fed and clothed in a color scheme according to years left before 'renewal.' Peter Ustinov plays a free human outside the dome at the end of the movie, and brings a different kind of simplicity, that of a nature-child. And the hapless inhabitants of the dome finally do get to see the outside world, which has healed from the impact of ancient war.The film has enough self-knowledge and humor to poke fun at its limitations (e.g. naming a boxy robot, who wants to off the hero after he becomes a 'runner', simply 'Box'). This film leaves one wistful at a simpler life, yet wary at what cost it would come. Ignorance is bliss, but not really, is the simple message of the film.I still enjoy it after seeing it 4 times, and that's worth at least a 7. For a younger generation, the miniatures special effects, fake laser pistols and oddly childish humans may be too much to take - my warning to you. On the other hand, if you enjoyed the original ""West World"" with Yul Brynner, ""Soylent Green,"" or similar 70s dystopias, you'll appreciate this film.",Logan's Run
109,spencergrande6,Silly Superficial Fun,6,4 December 2016,"Mostly pretty silly stuff. It really doesn't dig very deep into any facets of the situation other than, you know, dying at 30 kinda sucks and is like totally not fair man. The ending is a big question mark since the entire premise is invalidated: if there's not enough food how in the world are they all going to live forever in the outside world? In fact, much of what happens in this doesn't hold up to much scrutiny.The miniatures are terribly shot, the costumes cheesy, and the acting hammy, but it's still somewhat entertaining kitsch for the most part.""Fish, and plankton, and sea greens, and protein from the sea."" Hell yeah.",Logan's Run
110,noizyme,Great pre-Star Wars sci-fi movie that is still interesting to watch,6,5 March 2005,"I'm a fan of a lot of sci-fi related films, especially ones that introduce alternative ways of living and society in the future, so this film was right up my alley. This film had been recommended to me for awhile, and after I saw it, I can see why it was recommended.The story is pretty easy to understand: A man goes undercover in a future society to catch people who run away from the society because its standard of living is to kill off everyone at the age of 30. That means that this movie tackles religion, sociological advancement, and free thought/speech topics all in one film, which is spectacular.The movie plays out like THX-1138, except not as experimental and abstract. (They tell you explicitly what's going on unlike THX.) It features great visuals, great concepts on the future for government and society as a whole, and great design of every art form (music, interior design, and models of holograms and other fixtures). The actors had a great chemistry together, and everything was shot to emphasize these people bonding and pushing each other away in whatever given scene.I didn't like the cheap look of the mid-70's style movie (still with its rough edges and weird film qualities), but it is nice to see this historical work of art in sci-fi's culture. The music was interesting and very avant garde, featuring mostly noodling on a Casio keyboard, except the minimal style in the songs actually helped the feel of what Michael Anderson, the director, felt that the future music standard might be like. The film as a whole felt that it was dragging in parts where new characters were introduced, but it had a good premise.Overall, I only gave it a 6/10, because while most of the film had a good feel to it, I felt that the dated film processing and rough feel to the action/special FX actually took away from the fluidity that it really could've used.",Logan's Run
111,andrew-hill515,It's OK I guess,5,26 August 2020,"It's sort of funny that in the book life ends at 21. It was changed to 30 because the director didn't want to cast everyone under 21, but I recall everyone looking to be at least 40.
I'm not sure about the rest of the cast but I'm pretty sure the guy who played the main character was closer to 40 than 30.
Maybe they should have put in ADR to make it 40 or 45 in post production to make it more believable when watching it and looking at the cast.",Logan's Run
112,fanan450,a magnificent gem from the 70's,8,25 October 2018,"This this is a magnificent rare gem from the seventies, this movie was so great in every way, the story was perfect I like the philosophy in it , the music was wonderful, the acting was good , the visual effect was the best back in those days , I really enjoyed watching this piece of art, I recommend it to all scifi fans, especially 70's movies fans .8/10",Logan's Run
113,GMJames,Some unintentional laughs mar this slightly better-than-average sci-fi tale,6,18 August 2005,"I remember first seeing ""Logan's Run"" on network television in the early 1980s. For obvious reasons (some nudity and violence), some scenes were edited for broadcast and in at least a few scenes, it made the movie more confusing than it needed to be.A few years later, I saw ""Logan's Run"" in its original PG-rated form. It was released one year before the blockbuster ""Star Wars"". While I was impressed with the story, despite being awarded a special Oscar, I thought the special effects were out-of-date.Nearly 25 years later, I had a chance to see ""Logan's Run"" and for what its worth, I found it to be an interesting, generally entertaining science fiction thriller that was ruined by several unintentionally funny moments.Michael York as Logan, the Sandman who unexpectedly becomes a runner and Jenny Agutter as Jessica, the runner who flees with Logan, tried their best but were ruined by some very bland, laughable dialog. I wanted to believe that they were people who have never been outside their domed paradise but I was not convinced.The special effects still scream ""Large miniature models!"" This is despite the fact that the miniatures were 3-4 feet in height.Speaking of models, how about the very small role Farrah Fawcett (then still married to Lee Majors) played as an employee at a laser salon. I believe she just started to play on ""Charlie's Angels"" when the film was released. Thank goodness she has done a much better job in other roles on TV.Roscoe Lee Browne was hired to play a very protective, psychotic robot. In some ways it felt like another rip-off from ""2001"" and perhaps it might have inspired later characters like the computer in ""Demon Seed"" or the flop ""Saturn 3"". To say that Browne's role was thankless is an understatement.There were some good things about the movie that kept me interested. The late Richard Jordan did a good job as Logan's friend who becomes Logan's enemy. I think it was because Jordan's character was serious and threatening enough to convince me that he's someone who should not be trusted.The idea that people would not live beyond 30 made for a very ideal sci-fi storyline. I understand that there were some changes from the novel but I found it to be a bit of an improvement and for the plot line provided a little bit of breathing room.As much as I was disappointed with the unconvincing scenes of the underground city, I was very impressed with the later scenes where Logan and Jessica tries to find Sanctuary but finds many cats and their unnamed owner, played with a wink and a smile by Peter Ustinov.If Ustinov's character had that much wonder and intentional humor with the other characters at the beginning of the movie, I might have enjoyed ""Logan's Run"" even more.Overall, ""Logan's Run"" is an interesting but rough ride.",Logan's Run
114,blazesnakes9,"It's silly, but fun to watch",7,12 April 2014,"In the 70's, science-fiction films gave way to a meaning of life that was affecting our own time. Such problems that was notable during this decade are oil shortage, inflation, government scandals and even wiretapping. Few of those films portrayed the future as nightmarish and startling. But, what if there was a future where people can live in a world of pleasure? What if you didn't realized the difference the truth and the untruth?Well, then, look no further to Logan's Run. The setting for the movie takes place in the 23rd century. In this futuristic society, you can live in a world full of pleasure and wonder. However, there's two problems. One: there are no old people in this society. Everybody is young and free. Two: By the time you reached the age of 30, your time is up. Furthermore, a silver crystal that is imprinted on the palm on your hand tells you if you're time is up. If it blinks red, your time is up. If it doesn't blink, you still have time to live. Our main protagonist is Logan 5 (Michael York). Logan is a sandman, which means that his job involved hunting down runners who don't want to get renewed in a place called the ""Carrousel"". But, when Logan himself decides to become a runner himself, he put his own job and his life on the line. His female lover, Jessica (Jenny Agutter) decides to run with him. Together, they venture out of their own domed future society and into the abandoned world of Planet Earth. By this time, in the year 2274, Washington D.C. has become a derelict. When Logan and Jessica come across a old man (Peter Ustinov), they realized that they can live old and never have to die. Knowing that their futuristic society is being manipulated to believe in lies, Logan and Jessica must exposed the truth before they get captured by the Sandmen. The movie isn't great science-fiction, unlike other serious science-fiction movies like A Clockwork Orange or 2001: A Space Odyssey. But, it's silly and fun to see, even if you're seeing some obvious plot holes. What I like most about Logan's Run is that the premise is similar to Brave New World. In that book, the main characters, Bernard and Lenina escape from their own society to venture out into a very different and very much ignored society that seems to be forgotten. Yet, there are some interesting things that Logan's Run provides to the viewers and those who are science-fiction fans. And that is, the world isn't always truthful when you manipulate people to believe in lies. That kind of concept is mirrored in this movie, similar to a real-life event that occurred in the 70's that really shocked a lot of people. That event was Watergate.As for the special effects, they seems to be dated since this film was beaten one year later by the massive success of Star Wars. The art- direction is very well-done in this film, even though it was shot on location in Texas. Beside all of the dazzling, yet dated special effects, there's a interesting character named Box, who is a metallic robot that attacks Logan and Jessica. He may not the next HAL 9000, but Box is somewhat special, even though he may be the most unlikeliest movie robot I've seen, beside the fact that he's voiced by Roscoe Lee Browne.The acting in Logan's Run is good, but at certain times in the movie, I felt that the actors were simply enjoyed being in this future world. York is convincing as the hero, so is Agutter as Logan's lover. As for the supporting cast, I admired the supporting character of the old man, played by Peter Ustinov. Ustinov's character seemed to be way out of Logan's and Jessica's lead when it comes to their presence. Farrah Fawcett-Majors plays a small role as a beautician, who gets caught up in Logan's run from the law. I'm not sure if Fawcett is in the right role in this movie, but I accepted what was the screen because of the film's zany and quirky view of future values.Logan's Run won a Special Achievement Academy Award for Visual Effects and was also nominated for 2 Oscars. For its time, Logan's Run seems to poke fun at the 70's with values, but it's nevertheless silly and fun, even if you're not following the plot holes.Besides, who said that science-fiction could be so fun?★★★ 3 stars.",Logan's Run

I actually love the plot because it's like many sci-fi writings - it's prescient (seeing the future). Unfortunately,
there's so much attempt at special effects that it's thin and full of holes.Consider monster companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook and then imagine a future where they control
what you think and do. Of course all this is complicit with the world's governments. Wait ... is that now or the future?ACTING:
The acting is OK, but aside from the leads, it's got ""Made-for-TV"" actors written all over it.Hint: When Farah Fawcett-Majors was in a film it was not a good sign.TEMPO:
OK, but it dragged out too much while lacking substance.CINEMATOGRAPHY:
The props were ... probably the best they could do, but I'd rather have less props and more substance (and better acting).DIRECTING / WRITING:
Neither really produced anything strong or brilliant.Is it a very good film? No.Should you watch this once? Sure, it might give you perspective on our modern value system.Rating: 7.0.",Logan's Run

Nolan so that therefore Malibu couldn't even adapt Logan's Search. Another inspiration that this film has is next year's Movie remake.In Star Wars #4 in its own letters column it says according to a reader's review the third of outer space fantasy films to be adapted as a comic after 2001:A Space odyssey;Logans Run;& then next Star Wars & then the response given was that the former is not an Outer Space Fantasy film.Yes you may say this film has yes a dazzling 1st Half prelude to Star Wars showing fun & high excitement in the year 2274 as I'll add to what the reviewer,Leonard Maltin had said up to a half before he said canceled out by a dreary second half.Yes Movie going is a very personal experience & I've been sent ever since I had first seen it during the summer of 1976.The TV-series of which you could call a parallel universe story with a twisted plot.Other than these like 1984 Logan's Run is in the mind of which makes it hard to bring to the screen whether on TV or in the Movies the big screen or small short or tall.Thanks to those on the IMDb site of whom agree with CBS-TV's & as well as my Star Wars comparison analogies etc. As you maybe now can tell The influence of my title is in part from the Star War's book's title of which is called Splinter of the mind's eye.Truthfully Stephen ""Steve"" G.

117,cutter-12,God it's tacky,5,14 January 2006,"This production is a sensory bad dream, full of bad sets, costumes, sfx and acting (save for Peter Ustinov who is always watchable). MGM apparently had a higher budget than George Lucas had to make Star Wars yet this film is gawdawful to look at and to listen to. The budget must have gone mostly to Michael York's bank account coming off his Musketeers success. Filmed in a shopping mall with bad neon trappings and dreadful miniature work, you're already pulled out of this by minute 5. I saw it in 1976 and it looked cheesy then.The story of course is decent sci/fi, and with a better production design, script, and a better director could have been as interesting as Planet of the Apes, Forbidden Planet, Silent Running, THX 1138, or even Zardoz. It's plastic and clunky and more laughable than engrossing. Just wait until Roscoe Lee Browne as the cyborg 'Box' shows up in the ice caves. Your finger will be on the stop button.It's too bad such a potentially thoughtful piece of sci/fi ended up in the hands of such unimaginative film-makers. Hopefully there'll be a better remake at some point, though Minority Report pretty much covered the same territory for all intents and purposes. And it sucked too.",Logan's Run
118,unakaczynski,This is one film badly in need of a remake...,7,27 September 2005,"Classic Science-Fiction usually revolves around a central theme geared toward modern humans, though told in a post-modern setting. That theme is generally the human condition. What does it mean to be human? What is humanity? Are we really free, and if so, how would we know? It's funny that it takes crazy-ass movies set hundreds of years in the future with robots and lasers and aliens and god-knows-what-else to bring this message across. But, that's classic science fiction for you!Logan's Run focuses on our hero, Logan as it is, and his running. Running is what you do when you flee when it's your time to be ceremonially killed when you reach the ripe old age of 30 in the hyper-modern, freedomless society of 23rd Century Earth. Logan, as a Sandman (futuristic policeman) is normally working hard to chase down runners, but now it's his turn as ordered by the giant computer than runs the huge domed-in city in which all the known citizens of Earth reside. He's really on a journey to discover his own humanity, as if you didn't see that coming, right?Here's the breakdown:The Good:--Classic Science Fiction, who doesn't like that?--Pretty good acting.--Nice sets and interesting visuals.--Where'd all this nudity come from? This is PG, right?--Pretty decent special effects.Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:--Ridiculous computer technology, especially from a modern (21st Century) viewpoint.--This came out only a year before Star Wars, so why does it feel like 15 years?--Story, characters all portrayed and delivered well.The Bad:--This particular vision of the future doesn't hold up well over a span of nearly 30 years. Star Trek predates it by several years and is a more accurate representation.--Awful costumes, and damn uninspired.--Not a helluva lot of depth.The Ugly:--Early synthesizer-era film. So, throughout a large portion, there is some of the most horrendous, repulsive synth music you could dare imagine. I swearit's like they just handed the keyboard to some drugged-up, fingerless semi-retarded hippie and let him compose blindly in a room with dive-bombing bats attacking him from all sides. What the hell is wrong with people in the 70's?Well then, this PG-rated SF film had nudity. As a matter of fact, it had quite a damn bit for a PG film, including, a chase through a wildly-lighted, imaginatively visualized sex club! The film rolls by as though through the haze of a dream and itself feels quite dreamywhich isn't bad. It adds well to the atmosphere, which is only hindered by the truly awful music headbutting it's way uncomfortably into the film. The story, as I said, has a central theme, which is the human animal, and the human condition. It is, very clearly, classic Science Fiction, and quite enjoyable to watch. Although, by today's standards (this being written in 2005), it is terribly dated as are some of the effects, which for the most part are done well enough. However, the film's prediction of the future leaves a lot to be desired, and if you compare it to the truly visionary works such as Star Trek (late 60's) or Star Wars (which followed only a year later), Logan's Run teeters on the brink of obsolescence. It's unfortunate, but that's the way it is. We can all rest assured, however, that the story here is what really matters, and thankfully, it comes through rather nicely.Acting: 7/10 Story: 8/10 Atmosphere: 7/10 Cinematography: 8/10 Character Development: 6/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 7/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 8/10 (this is a lot for a PG film) Violence/Gore: 3/10 (no gore, mild violence) Music: 1/10 (synthesizer music be damned!)

A grim look at the downside of maintaining an ""ideal"", utopian society.  When you hit 30, you either have the option of willingly submitting yourself to be killed under a pretense of renewal, or having the Sandmen play with you before they go in for the kill.  Neither option seems really appealing.  But the idea of one of the killers having to face their mortality is an interesting idea.A little slow in places (but I did keep wanting to see what would happen next), and some of the special effects look really dated (even to '77's ""Star Wars""), but the story holds up well, and it's an entertaining ride overall.It's truly a classic of the genre, and I wish I had seen it sooner.",Logan's Run

But that is how all futuristic movies will end as the future gets closer. Old fashioned. That doesn't make any less of a movie. Sure, it has been seen before.

In this case, that the world of the 23rd century was going to look pretty much like 1976, only everybody lives in a shopping mall and is always dressed to 'disco'. Everyone has to die or exit the city at the age of 30, so naturally we have 34-year-old Michael York and 39-year-old Richard Jordan hunting down the 'runners'. While we're at it, try 26 year-old Gary Morgan as a 15 year-old, complete with a suspiciously indistinct hairline. The 'domed city' looked like it was made by school kids on a tabletop, complete with conspicuous toy trees. The second half of the movie had the central couple wandering around A) real, grimy-looking factory interiors and B) what looked like a national park for way too long. Peter Ustinov was a bloody old ham. Farrah Fawcett makes a terrible job of an admittedly dim-witted role, but maybe someone sexy who could act would have been a better casting decision. The director was a long way from his 1950s heyday and didn't do his copybook any favors with this plodding, unexciting entry (nor his next one, which was 'Orca'). Yes it was bad, particularly towards the end but try as I might, I can't totally hate 'Logan's Run', perhaps because it has a certain amount of admirable chutzpah (and Jenny Agutter's undressing scene. That's where the extra rating star came from).",Logan's Run

The story is complex, and the special effects are of course, from that era. However, one must look at it from a viewpoint of artistic and imaginative perspective to realize that this can easily qualify as a decent sci-fi flick that should not be overlooked, and may even compare with the likes of Planet of the Apes, Total Recall, Ghataca, Minority Report, etc. Okay, don't laugh at the Styrofoam special effects and the many holes left open and unanswered, they did their best. The premise of the futuristic elements of a human android society with a savior-type individual leading to change and find the real truth is what compels one to take this well acted (York, Jenny, Ustinov, and character that was York's sandman friend) movie and watch it over some popcorn.

Some of my favourites are The Time Machine (the original), Soylent Green, The Incredible Shrinking Man, The Fly (the original), Omega Man, Battlestar Galactica, Battle Beyond the Stars etc. Anyway, I'd never heard of Logan's Run (I'm under 30 by the way!) and some of my favourites are kinda hard to track down on DVD, so I saw that this was made just before Star Wars and thought i'd give it a go.I had absolutely no expectations, didn't even really know what it was about, and i must admit i was immediately enraptured by that model! Yeah it's fake as anything but hey, it looks damn cool i think (reminds me of toys I used to play with as a kid, maybe it's triggering some weird emotional memory in me hehe). Anyway, I *almost* hit STOP about 5 minutes into the film because the Michael York character really offended me...i don't know why, it was his casual attitude and ditzy-boy hair, the fact he laughed while taunting the first ""runner"" we see...etc I just didn't find him appealing at all and I knew the movie went for another 110 minutes...but here's the thing, the STORY kept me watching. I *really* wanted to know what happened next...what Sanctuary was, if anything, and what the h*ll was really happening with that Carrousel thing... Bizarre imagery kept me watching too...and the establishing shots of that model city...fantastic in the true sense of the word.One thing that also had me lunging towards the STOP button a couple of times was that awful music. (Jerry Goldsmith, my man, you were talented but sheesh man what were you on???) I liked the way the score ""opened up"" a little when our two heroes ventured outside. A little less robotic, a little more natural-sounding. I stress ""a little"" though...it's still pretty bad.Okay, lastly, the thing that kept me enthralled was Jenny Agutter. My god...she is beautiful in this film.I picked it up on a whim in the bargain bin, and I will definitely watch this one again...it transports me back to a time when cartoons seemed as real as me.",Logan's Run

126,poc-1,Whats a nice girl like Jenny Agutter doing in a film like this?,7,22 August 2002,"This film is so bad it has to be seen to be believed. The dialogue and special effects are so wooden and transparent they are hilarious, all the more so because it takes itself seriously. It would be impossible to make a spoof of this because it would never be as funny as the real thing. Watch out for the miniature city complete with electric tube trains and cute little papier mache trees. Also don't miss Box, a ""robot"" played by an actor wearing a tin foil mask, flexible aluminium ducting over his arms sitting in a big silver box. I bet Lucas got the idea for Yoda's backwards grammar from Box. What is even funnier is that the film won an Oscar for visual effects.The film has many other saving graces especially Jenny Agutter running around in a green tunic, a scene involving Farrah Fawcett Majors with lots of lasers and a cameo by Peter Ustinov playing an old man living with a bunch of cats.",Logan's Run
127,zensixties,"Whether you're Green, Red,or Over 30 This is Great Sci-Fi!!!",10,15 January 2004,"Logan's Run is an excellent stylish sci-fi film from 1975 starring the great Michael York and the beautiful Jenny Agutter. It blew my mind seeing it as an 11-year-old and was so obsessed with it my mother used to say, ""He thinks everything's the 23rd century"". Logan 5 (York) is a Sandman who kills runners, people who reach the age of 30, but reject the chance to Renew on Carousel. As the film begins we see the cool domed city with Jerry Goldsmith's futuristic trippy soundtrack. In this world mainly filmed in a Fort Worth mall everyone has a life-clock and when they reach 30 it starts to blink red. Those who believe in renewal attend the Last Day ritual when the 30-year-olds come out with hoods and masks, then ""Identify...be strong and you will be renewed"" says the female computer voice. They disrobe to reveal tights with Evel Knievel designs and start to spin around and float up and blow up to the cheers of the crowd.Logan and his friend Francis (Richard Jordan) go on a hunt for runners killing them with fire spewing guns. Then Logan finds an Anck key and the master computer makes him search for Sanctuary by posing as a runner (some reviews of this film say Logan is 30, but he's ""4-years-away"", i.e. 26--York was really 32 though).The best thing about this is the stylish futuristic designs, the great believable acting of the stars, and the off-the-wall nonsensical speech of the senile old man (Peter Ustinov). And there's some great adventure as Logan and Jessica are chased out of the city by Francis through the labyrinthine subsystems, Box the crazy robot, and a beautiful ice cave scene. And for us guys our favorite line is ""we better take our clothes off before they freeze"", kind of weird that they put them back on, but our wish throughout the film comes true with a quick glimpse of Jenny Agutter disrobed.  Actually there is a fully nude scene here with them in each others' arms while Box sculpts them as per the book, alas it was cut from the film for a PG rating.  I never did quite get what Box was supposed to be.The plot itself has some serious inconsistencies. In the book the age for Renewal was 21, and the author got the idea from '60s youth culture (it was written in 1967). The idea was that youth would take over and get rid of all adults. The reason for the change to age 30 is the stars would be unbelievable as 20 year olds. You have to make many leaps over logic to suspend your disbelief here. You could say the city used this as population control. The idea of Renewal, well you can believe in reincarnation, but in this world it's implied Renewal means some scientific process controlled by the computer. When the computer tells Logan there are 1056 unaccounted for runners he says ""no one's ever been renewed?!"" However his conclusion cannot be logically drawn from information on unaccounted for runners.
In the cool ""surrogation"" scene with Logan in multiple hologram images saying ""There is Noooooo Sanctuary"", his answer does not compute so the city blows up....or was it his shooting the computer with his gun...or both. Here's a way to rationalize it though: the computer has a secret program to destroy the city when someone prefers life outside the dome...the purpose of shelter for what's left of humanity is fulfilled and it's time for them to go ""outside"".  And how they get outside the city to meet the old man so quickly and without a scratch on them is beyond me.  But I felt at the end, what happens now?  That cool city of sex, drugs, and cool carousel ritual is gone.  As Francis said, ""Is this good, is this what you want?!""  Now they are free to scrounge for survival and grow old and decrepid.  I believe in the book it wasn't an enclosed city, it was the whole world.  I wonder what the world outside the DC area was like in the film's backstory.Bottom line is the film is great not because of the plot, but because of the creativity and style. It won a special academy award for special effects and it's a true classic. Michael York still gets people who come up to him telling him Logan's Run was their favorite film of his (even with all the other great roles he's had).  And the rumors are flying about a remake! I'm working on a screenplay now to submit.",Logan's Run
128,sildarmillion,Holds Up Surprisingly Well,9,21 December 2018,"My interest in this movie stemmed from the fact that one of my friends was named after it. Other than that, I had no reason to be interested in a sci-fi movie from the '70s. I have doubts that sci-fi movies would age well. The special effects would probably look silly. The vision of the future will seem silly to us. So on and so forth. All that said, I was surprised how well this movie held up! It relied on ideas rather than visual effects (as good movies should) and the set up was so bizarre and post-apocalyptic-ish, that it didn't feel like an incompetent vision of the future. I would recommend this one despite the fact it's >40 years old.",Logan's Run
129,brower8,It now looks cheesy.,6,10 May 2003,"Great science fiction (Star Wars) has enduring value because it tells something worth knowing, and not obvious until it is told, about the human condition. Not-so-great science fiction, however good it looks when released, tells more about the time in which is made than in the supposed time of its setting.I thought Logan's Run great when it first came out, but recently I found the movie on DVD in a bargain bin. I was terribly disappointed. The movie had dated badly. The crystal city was a composite of a hippie paradise and with the 23rd-century equivalent of gladiator games. Everything was done for people but nobody really did anything -- no real work, and no real love, whether between spouses or between adults and children. Nobody really grew up.If there is any message in Logan's Run it's that genuine adults are necessary. We need the old fogies as repositories of knowledge and culture, people who can remind others that there is more to life than crude hedonism. Maybe if there's no Shakespeare, Mozart, or Degas -- or that one can never bond with grandchildren -- then old age is pure misery, something to be avoided at all costs, such as like being obliterated at age 29 in some carousel of death with the supposed promise of reincarnation as entertainment for people who have never developed empathy for fellow human beings.Acting looks shallow, but what would you expect in a world in which nobody has a genuine emotion because nothing exists to cause anyone to feel anything for anyone else?Update: it has since been released on Blu-Ray disc (2011) and is now far more visually satisfying than the DVD. The ethos remains the same, and one can learn something from it. But it is still not great science-fiction.",Logan's Run
130,jc1305us,"Good idea, not so good execution",5,26 July 2012,"I really wanted to like 'Logan's Run' as I am a big fan of the sci-fi/horror genre, but this one just left me flat. Others have commented that the special effects are pretty bad (true, but I couldn't care less) The real problem here is the script. It takes a really good idea and does almost nothing with it. To start, there really is no backstory for the main character Logan, who in the future dystopian world the characters inhabit, is charged with tracking down, and exterminating people that refuse to submit to the law of the land, namely that you must be sacrificed at age 30. Like I said, a good idea, in theory, but the actors just don't make me care. Michael York as Logan, is a 'Sandman' a man charged with tracking down those unfortunate souls who decide that maybe they don't want to die at 30. Considering life is one big party for the inhabitants of this world, all pleasure all the time, I can see their point! Unfortunately, we get no backstory on these characters! Why were they chosen for these assignments as executioners? What benefit do they get? They also die at 30 so why would they take the assignment?? Well, Logan meets a ""runner"" in the form of a beautiful woman Jenny Agutter, and initially is intent on finding her network of cohorts so he can take them all down, but as time passes, his feelings change, and he decides that he wants to live dammit! The movie plods along and eventually comes to an unsatisfying ending. I really can't recommend this one unfortunately however I will say the music is great. A half synthesizer, half orchestra score that is a highlight. If you're looking for a great sic-fi/end of the world movie, Charlton Heston in 'The Omega Man' is a much better film.",Logan's Run
131,Gatorman9,Soylent Green is made of People!,5,18 March 2019,"***SPOILER ALERT*** (WARNING!) This is yet another one of these 1970's fantasies that hasn't stood the test of time -- any time. I don't remember the ""wildly popular novel"" that is supposed to have inspired it (though now that I think of it, maybe I just DID see it peeking out of some kid's school book bag here or there, back in the day, and in paperback, of course), but the movie itself suffers from a surfeit of mid-budget 1970's production values (and even special effects miniatures that look like a 1959 World's Fair exhibit - and after a while, I could never see one of those monorail trains without expecting to hear the jingle of the trolley music from MR. ROGERS' NEIGHBORHOOD) and a look and feel of that shag carpeting and pastel polyester style that seemed too much even then and not surprisingly vanished after only a few years. Farah Fawcett (credited as Farah Fawcett-Majors, in the middle of her year-long non-marriage to Lee Majors, no less) and her trademark billowing cloud of hair appearing here as the World's Absolute Dumbest Dirty Blonde Ever (in her character's case, it was evidently her IQ that was not allowed to exceed 30), predictably could not do anything but contribute to these feelings, and even the appearance of Special Guest Stars like Roscoe Lee Brown and no less a luminary than SIR Peter Ustinov (the only time I ever heard him with a remarkably uninteresting flat American accent, however else he characteristically strove to ham this up) were insufficient to effect anything like a meaningful save. The whole effort seems to be nothing more than an especially mechanical, consciously formulaic, paint-by-numbers cobbling together of by-then shopworn sci-fi movie cliches that should have seemed to the filmmakers well past their best-by date even in 1976. Even then this film garnered the reputation of being especially only just so-so.The story starts with the obligatory purportedly casual but necessarily exposition-packed conversation intended to inform you that you are Not In Kansas Anymore, Toto (which is thus supposed to engage you by intriguing you, but is so obviously obligatory that it doesn't), and then proceeds on to a rousing round of Can-You-Name-That-Shooting-Location-(Hey-Wait-I-Was-There-Three-Summers-Ago-On-Vacation-And-Even-Bought-These-Sneakers-At-That-Shopping-Mall). The sci-fi cliche festival continues apace from there, whether it is that ""There Is No Renewal!"" (and if that were not enough, even, ""There Is No Sanctuary!"", a la ""Soylent Green is made of People!"", only not just once but TWICE, as if you missed it the first time), or having the whole thing end with the destruction of the oppressive antagonist regime in a chain reaction of explosions starting from deep in the Secret Control Center Of The Evil Bad Guys (a la Bond, practically any, JAMES Bond, movie) triggered entirely inexplicably by the main character causing the Controlling Computer (""I can't do that, Dave"", i.e., 2001) to melt down by tormenting its subroutines with The Truth (""I . . . am . . . Landru . . . Sterilize . . . STERILIZE!"" (You can say Captain James T. Kirk, Federation starship ENTERPRISE, can't you? Circa 1966-69? Sure you can . . . and on at least FOUR different occasions before this movie was even a gleam in these writers' eyes). There is even a sequence depicting the National Mall in Washington, D.C., in ruins that blatantly channels the denouement of PLANET OF THE APES, 1968 (Ohhh Myyyy Godddddddd!!!), complete with portrayal of a house chamber in the Capitol building filled with deteriorating portraits and books (surely there would be somebody in the audience who hadn't seen ZARDOZ, released in 1974).The bottom line is that movies are about stimulating a willing sense of disbelief, and I never found this one doing so. It reminds me of, lacking a budget or anything like expertize, some of the work-arounds we used to attempt in 8th grade summer school film class in San Diego (I still remember the lengths we went to to get a portable classroom building at at a junior high school to look like the train station in Dodge City in the Old West). Whatever they were trying to do (and in some spots that was not all that obvious), all too often and just in general it just didn't work. Whatever its thematic aspirations (or pretensions, for that matter), it is no FAHRENHEIT 451 (1966). (It is not intended to be a parody, so it is no BARBARELLA, 1968, either.) The only thing I really appreciated on a recent screening at the advanced age I now find myself approaching all too rapidly were the filmy costumes which adorned (except when they didn't quite, or even had to be removed altogether once or twice for some reason involving no objective logic whatsoever in regard to the plot, at least) the ample quantity of comely female extras (as well as the leading lady when she first appears), and which in yet one more exhibition of true short-lived 1970's style, made so much of the apparent proposition that in the year 2274, not only have the human race forgotten there could be such a thing as old people, they have also forgotten there could be such a thing as the manufacture and use of the bra.(P.S. Yes, I realize that some might think that in a world where no one survives past age 30, the continued proliferation of bras would not be inherently necessary in any case. My own experience, however, has been that such a thought would be a mere middle-aged misapprehension. My memory is holding up much better than my eyesight (among other things). Also, be sure to read the review of IMDb member ""ace-150"", entitled ""Euthanize Me Now"". It made me LOL.)",Logan's Run

During Logan's Run, when Farrah Fawcett (then -Majors) appeared on the screen for the first time, there was electricity in the theater. Audience members murmured (that was in the days when people didn't talk during movies). Even at a young age, I remember what a sensation Farrah caused on the screen. Seeing the film for a second time after so many decades, it doesn't pack the same punch. Michael York and Jenny Agutter are good. The MGM sets appear cheap, despite the 9 million budget (a lot of money for MGM at the time. Westworld, made just 3 years earlier, was only a bit more than 1 million).

Ballard, the aged leader of a rebel movement, becomes a senile old man played by Ustinov.How was the old man able to live in the wild? How could Jessica and Logan live in the wild for months when they were sheltered city people? Where were the other people in the wild?

It's inferior in so many ways it would be pointless to list them all. Except I will say that the special effects are atrocious. I won't bother going into all of the gory details but I would like to point out two scenes that deserve special attention. The first is the part with the robot in the ice cave. How there is a frozen cave with ice sculptured animals on top of the underground city outside of a futuristic D.C., I don't know. What I do know is that it and the robot who lives there make for one of the dumbest nonsensical scenes in the history of Sci-Fi. Why it was even in there, besides providing an opportunity for the chick to get naked, I don't know. I dare anyone not to laugh at the robot when they see it; I wonder how many takes it took the actors to get through it themselves. The other scene that I especially disliked was the part with the old man. As if the movie wasn't boring enough the makers of this film decided to have a scene where two people ask an old man a bunch of questions he doesn't know the answer to. He mumbles, talks about his cats, and then says I don't know. Wow what a great character! It's just stupid, they could have written in any character but they decided to put in a boring old man. It's movies like this that make people hate sci-fi. Thank god Star Wars came along the following year and revolutionized action/sci-fi movies.

As another has said, I really wonder if some other reviewers watched the same movie as I. The acting is, by today's standards, absolutely wooden to the point of self-parody.

It's a rather limited category - especially when you are considering films made before ""Star Wars"". I start thinking of films like ""Rollerball"", and even the ""Planet of the Apes"" movies. They're the type of movies that were conceived with a type of socio-political statement & theme in mind (mostly revolving around a futuristic Utopian world), and in the process of showing that futuristic world, managed to date themselves by showing off their state-of-the-art 70's technology. Even discreet things like the font used for public billboards screams out ""THIS WAS MADE IN THE 70's !!!"". They have that really cheesy curvy quasi-futuristic type of font that was so popular in the 70's for a while. Now you see that font, and you think to yourself ""damn, people actually thought that looked 'futuristic' at one time ?""Still, at the base of this movie there is indeed an interesting underlying story. Sure, it's a bit ridiculous (you can live in a Utopian world - but you can only live until you're 30), but it's still an interesting idea.
I remember watching this flick when I was 7 and being completely fascinated with it. I just loved this world. It was amazing to me. I mean, did you see how they could just go into those cars and get taken anywhere they wanted automatically ?!?! WOW ! It reminded me of my family trip to Disney World the summer before !I just watched ""Logan's Run"" again for about the 6th or 7th time last night. It's still an entertaining flick. I enjoyed it. But all I kept thinking while watching it was ""This movie needs to be remade."" If they can remake ""Rollerball"" and ""Planet of the Apes"", then they need to remake ""Logan's Run"". This is a story that can truly benefit from a remake today. This is especially true when you consider the elements of this movie which are keeping it from being a ""great"" movie are fixable. When I say that, I'm not just referring to improved special effects. I'm also talking about the pacing of the movie & the focus. This movie was best when it was focusing on the futuristic Utopian world, during the first hour or so. It started to go downhill after that. I think a remake that focused on that futuristic world, and its interesting society, would be much more entertaining. Obviously, an improved ending will elevate a remake as well.

141,uroshnor54,Even Better Than the Original Star Wars,10,7 February 2014,"Alright, this movie is not better than STAR WARS IV (which came out one year after it did) if you're looking at it objectively. But, speaking subjectively, I personally think this movie has some real charm and I enjoy watching it more than any of the STAR WARS movies. I won't say this is my favorite movie of all-time (that would be BLADE RUNNER) but it does come really close. BLADE RUNNER, which is another dystopian movie, isn't a movie that I can watch whenever. It's really good but it's kind of depressing. LOGAN'S RUN, on the other hand, is a movie that's incredibly fun to watch.The story makes no sense, to tell you the truth. Out of the many things that don't make sense here are a few:1. (This shouldn't be a spoiler because the fact that Logan becomes a Runner is implied by the title of the movie.) If the Computer's goal is to find Sanctuary and have it destroyed, why doesn't it order a team of Sandmen to do the job? Why does it make Logan's life-clock blinking-red, making it look like it's his Last Day? It seems counterproductive to make him a Runner to look for a way out of the city.Which leads to...2. How come the Sandmen and the computer don't know about the room where all the Runners are staying (in the scene where a group of Runners use glowing spears to stop Jessica and Logan from progressing)? If the computer runs the city, shouldn't it know about all of the various rooms it comprise? 3. And why didn't those particular Runners with the glowing spears even try to go through the city's exit?This movie isn't BATTLEFIELD: EARTH, though. Even though it doesn't really make sense, it's still fun to watch and it looks nice. According to Roger Ebert's review of the film, it had a production budget of around $9 million. That's not too far below the production budget of STAR WARS IV, which was around $11 million according to Box Office Mojo. Some of the effects look dated, definitely. The miniatures lack detail. Box looks ridiculous (you can see Roscoe Lee Brown's mouth underneath the robot costume's mouth). The costumes are also pretty bland. Most of the movie was shot in a shopping mall. These might seem like criticisms of the movie (and many people will probably dislike the movie for these things) but they all add to its charm. But I do love the entire second half of the movie, especially the ending. I think Michael York and Richard Jordan played their characters well. Jenny Agutter is pretty nice all throughout as well. Jessica 6 is definitely one of the best sci-fi movie heroines of all-time.I don't think anyone will say that this isn't one of the best pre-STAR WARS sci-fi movies. It's not as good as 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY or THE FORBIDDEN PLANET. (Once again, this is objective. I won't deny the greatness of 2001 since it really did change sci-fi film. If we're talking subjectively, though, 2001 is a really boring movie, in my opinion. THE FORBIDDEN PLANET is fun to watch and I thought it was great how they made Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST in a sci-fi setting but it is not as fun as LOGAN's RUN.) Without a doubt, though, it is much better than the majority of pre-STAR WARS sci-fi movies like SOYLENT GREEN, ZARDOZ, FAHRENHEIT 451 (the book is great but the movie isn't), etc.LOGAN'S RUN really deserves more attention. I find myself enjoying it more and more with each viewing. There are quite a few dystopian movies coming out today, like THE HUNGER GAMES. They take themselves too seriously. Sure BLADE RUNNER does take itself seriously, but its premise isn't as outlandish as those of other dystopian movies. I don't think LOGAN'S RUN does. Or, at least, I don't take it too seriously. It's just a fun movie is all I can say.",Logan's Run
142,rokcomx,One of MANY versions of the World in which Logan runs,6,8 April 2010,"Close enough to the original novel by George Clayton Johnson and Bill Nolan to loosely qualify as an ""adaptation,"" tho the filmmakers changed even the most basic premise of what age qualifies you for the death penalty (the book stipulates that only kids and teenagers are allowed to live).Johnson made his mark writing for the original Twilight Zone, Star Trek, Kung Fu (for which he wrote the pilot), and the original Ocean's 11 story. Nolan, however, is the one who has picked up the Logan ball and run with a sequel - Logan's World - and a just-released comic book series based on his own view of the World in which Logan runs.The original novel, tho slim, remains the best of Logan's lot - the shortlived TV show being the worst - tho I'd recommend seeking the 1990s comic books drawn by Elf artist Barry Blair.

143,stiv-7,"See this not as futuristic, but of its time....",8,5 November 2001,"I'm going to SCREAM if I hear one more person complain about the look of this film. It's so easy to nitpick and complain about how horrible 70s set design and fashion were from a vantage point of 25 years later. People fail to realise that science fiction films, even if futuristic in nature, are merely mirrors of the periods in which they were made. 50s science fiction? Laugh-out-loud funny. 60s? Same story. Even 80s science fiction looks incredibly silly, but you have to get past the look and consider the message of the piece. Soylent Green and Rollerball look pretty dated now too, but they still seem to get more respect than this one. Logan's Run is the ultimate indictment of the Me Decade. It takes on the hedonistic pursuits of the 70s (swinging, narcissism, disco) and removes them to another space and time so we can view this particular society objectively. It points a finger at those who buy the ""I hope I die before I get old"" line without question, and shows them how myopic that point of view is. It shows us that the world is what we make of it. So sure, laugh at the costuming, the special effects, the sometimes inane dialogue, but watch the movie a couple of times before you jump all over it.The first time I saw Logan's Run was in a TV cut in the early 80s, and I didn't really get it. Now that I have reached ""Carrousel"" age, I see it differently and understand its point. See it with an open mind, if that's still possible.",Logan's Run
144,stmichaeldet,Really - It's Better Than You Remember,7,7 May 2006,"Over the last 30 years, Logan's Run has become somewhat of a laughingstock, the poster child of bad '70s science fiction. Its mention evokes images of cheesy sets, bad action, silly plotting, and heavy-handed yet ultimately empty social commentary. Is this reputation deserved? On viewing it recently, I have to say, no.That's not to say that Logan's Run doesn't have its flaws. Its main problem is the dialog, which is often leaden, unrealistic, and exposition-heavy. This creates an unfortunate challenge for the actors, who often appear to be visibly struggling to make a scene work despite the stupid lines the script gives them.But once you get beyond that, there's a lot of good stuff to be found. The plot is tight, and Logan's gradual shifts from undercover agent trying to discover the whereabouts of hundreds of unaccounted-for Runners, to becoming a Runner himself, to revolutionary dedicated to ending the false ""Renewal"" ceremony, ring true and engage the viewer's sympathies. The sets, while certainly dated (particularly in technological terms), are impressive and evocative. And if anything, the film's vision of a future obsessed with youth, beauty, and obedience is even more meaningful today than when it was released.The concept of Sanctuary is particularly well handled. Early in the film, Sanctuary is a legendary place, a haven for Runners who manage to escape, which no one inside the dome has ever seen or had contact with, yet inspires Runners to attempt escape from their society's strict codes of behavior. Later, we learn that there is no real Sanctuary; the Runners who pass beyond the final gate and escape from the Sandmen have been captured and frozen by a malfunctioning food-storage 'bot, and there is a strong implication that Logan and Jessica are the first to fully escape the dome and reach the outside. What they find is a real Sanctuary, a lush, green world where people could live freely, without the oppressive restrictions of dome society.Other notable features include Peter Ustinov's wonderful performance as the confused, lonely Old Man, living in the ruins of Washington, D.C., and Logan's interrogation scene on returning to the dome, where holograms are used to represent the computer pulling information out of his brain.So, why is this film ridiculed? I have a theory. Within about a year, Star Wars was released, and literally changed the audience's expectations of how an SF film should look. Logan's Run, with it's clean, simple design, human scale, and strong moralistic tones, represented the last gasp of a now-obsolete style of film-making, and as such, suffered greatly in comparison to the new wave of SF films. I think it deserves another look.",Logan's Run

146,pocca,The Last B Movie?,7,30 October 2005,"I know that ""Logan's Run"" was a major studio product and not technically a B movie at all, but with its pre-Star Wars special effects it inevitably comes across as one to twenty first century viewers. After the wizardry of George Lucas I imagine it is pretty much impossible to get people to pay to see movies like ""Logan's Run""that is, films whose special effects may not be particularly convincing, but whose story is compelling enough to get the viewers involved anyway.And in fact, the premise of ""Logan's Run"" was compelling enough for it to become one of the best known science fiction dystopias evera world of nonstop pleasure in which, presumably in the interests of population control, everyone dies at thirty. One of this movie's brilliant strokes (or perhaps that of the original book) was to make this grim society a lush matriarchy, rather than a bleak Orwellian patriarchythe soothing motherly voice of the master computer, the flowerlike uniforms worn by the inhabitants, the circusy spectacle of carousel that disguises execution as a kind of quasi-organic renewal are all enough to almost convince the viewers that these people would allow passively allow themselves to be killed decade after decade. A few ""runners"" who have their suspicions always try to flee, but they are taken care of by the Sandmen who in their black uniforms are the only ominous element of this society that looks like one giant shopping mall (and was in fact filmed in one).The film is centred on Logan5the characters' names oddly anticipated the online names of our own timea Sandman with qualms(well played by Michael York who has the blue eyed, open faced look of a typical sci-fi hero). He is paired up with Jessica6 (Jenny Agutter) who is part of an underground movement to help runners escape and is in turn a typically tomboyish sci-fi heroine. The two end up fleeing the enclosed city for ""sanctuary"" a supposed safe haven for runners. First, though, they must deal with the sinister android Box (with his campy lines Box is both comic and creepy the way movie robots often are and is one of the highlights of ""Logan's Run""). Logan and Jessica finally make it outdoors where instead of sanctuary they discover an elderly man (Peter Ustinov), evidently the last descendant of a community that managed to survive outside. After a relatively peaceful interval Logan and Jessica return to the enclosed city, an ill advised decision that recalls the horror movie cliché of the heroine running back into the haunted house, but they manage to destroy the dystopia and save the others. All ends on a rather sweetly naïve note with the pleasure loving party goers (who lives once included heavy drug use and orgies) clustering around the Peter Ustinov character like expectant children.The movie has its problems. The shift from the enclosed city to the outdoors is rather jolting with regard to tonewe move from the city's sexy, seventies styles hedonism to a far more innocent B movie landscape (the relationship of the hero and heroine is similarly chaste, non-withstanding the nudity and implied lovemaking). There is also a lot of earnest, clunky dialog between Logan and Jessica as they express surprise at the concepts of aging and marriage. And, of course, like all movies about the future, ""Logan's Run"" is very much a product of its times. This doesn't merely apply to styles (apparently in the 23rd century everyone wears shags); rather, in our post AIDS, ""just say no"" era the rampant sex and drug use that characterize life in the city also seem dated.Nevertheless, on the whole, ""Logan's Run"" is an enjoyable film if the viewer can get beyond its relatively unsophisticated special effects.",Logan's Run

They obviously threw a lot of money at this film and, yet, it looks like the Tuesday Night Movie of the Week. The scene where they have a shoot-out with what appears to be a very high-end cappuccino maker is right out of Santa Claus versus the Martians. This was made ONE year before Star Wars and eight years after 2001. There's no excuse for the production design of this film. The Andromeda Strain (1973) is as slick as hot grease compared to this. I might have given it credit for campiness if it weren't two soul-sucking hours long.

150,brijess-2,Stunning Sci-Fi,8,31 January 2003,"Logan's Run is a dazzling sci-fi film. It is set in a very ""alien"" future of the United States; only everyone is forced to live indoors in a ""City of Domes."" Society is peaceful and fun loving. When you reach 30, you are to renew your life through a ritual or never live again.The story of Logan's Run is quite frightening. Director Michael Anderson does a fantastic job of keeping the frightening aspects of the story going. From the pleasant yet somewhat menacing voice of the main computer to the idea behind the ""Carousel"", you never for a minute doubt what is going on and you really pull for the central characters.The DVD transfer is good, probably as good as they are going to get, because some scenes of the film always looked a little ""muddy."" The enhanced soundtrack is in Dolby and while not 5.1, is still sounds much better than the VHS. The commentary is good but nothing spectacular. And the widescreen is really nice!A word of caution. While the film is rated PG, there are several scenes of brief nudity, one of which really doesn't further the plot any and is unnecessary (in fact, in the commentary, the scene takes the director by surprise and he says he forgot about it). The other is an elaborate scene in the ""love shop."" Despite that, there is very little graphic violence and little to no profanity.Logan's Run is a solid film. It looks a little dated now, but still entertains!",Logan's Run
151,mark-4522,Old style sci-fi which provokes thought and fun,9,27 February 2015,"Many sci-fi films from the 70's have logical holes all over the place such as Westworld (Why build a theme park for super robots when the company could make a lot more money selling them to the military like ED-209 on Robocop?) but they can still provide a lot of food for thought.Logan's Run is about a post apocalyptic underground society which has evolved in a way that was alien to the 1970's movie viewer but in some ways prophetic today. A world where a father doesn't know his child's birth mother? Where children are raised entirely by the state? Where the concept of marriage is unknown? Welcome to The Future!And the plot holes are hilarious. They have a machine where you can get a girl for the night teleported to your room like a pizza but they use monorails. If you have teleporters, why use monorails? And if everyone is being tracked, how does any resistance have a chance whatsoever?In the 70's, shopping malls were seen as The Future even as they're being torn down today while folks shop in mega specialty stores such as Home Depot or buy online.

152,Puke Bag,"First impressions, 38 years after release",6,14 June 2014,"After almost 40 years, any science fiction film will feel very dated, and Logan's Run is no exception. Having only seen bits and pieces of it on television, I borrowed a DVD from the local library and sat through it and found it a bit more difficult to sit through than I was expecting. The acting is pretty hammy and the story has a lot of holes in it. Dialogue attempts to be futuristic-sounding, which probably would've worked back then, but doesn't work now.A modernized remake has been tossed around Hollywood for a while, which would have to be extensively redone, not just for the visual effects. The film does have its moments, and overall, it is an impressive achievement, but it's a bit of a chore to sit through if you weren't old enough to appreciate it when it first came out.",Logan's Run

154,joe12361,Dystopian Twist,7,26 January 2019,"Agree with the other reviewer who cites Outland, Zardoz, Silent Running etc as good recommendations that are set in similar dystopias. I haven't seen many of these, but hopefully might check them all out eventually. However, from my own limited film experience, I can say I believe with some certainty that two more modern films of the same genre that were both influenced quite a bit by this one are 'In Time' (2011) starring Justin Timberlake and 'The Island' (2005) starring Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson; all three are dystopian; but I preferred the latter two films. Which isn't to say Logan's Run isn't good for its day; in many ways it's the precursor for those other two films, and I feel they both borrowed quite heavily off this original in their own ways. To sum the whole premise up very quickly; they live in an amoral and arbitrary world where no-one lives beyond 30 years of age and life is devoid of meaning. There is no innovation, no competitive spirit, no will to succeed, no work ethic. In many ways then, a living hell for people like myself and I imagine many others. What ostensibly can be the purpose of life, if not to make a contribution to the world, by whatever means possible, be that progeny, gainful employment, productive labour, the willingness and desire to learn and relay that information to others? I.e. knowledge and wisdom. More than anything though a world in which the value of hard work goes not just unrewarded, but unrealised and unrecognised, for the concept of 'hard work' itself is an alien one. It is a world cut off from nature, whose inhabitants are profoundly ignorant and childish, availing of a strange mixture of a simultaneously archaic and frighteningly advanced technology, who in this universe are completely uneducated and lacking in the knowledge of how to build or understand the machines and technology they use on a daily basis (Apart from the 'plastic surgeon' who doesn't seem to fit the rule of general ignorance and who says he built the surgery machine). There are moments of cheer in the film however; when they thwart the preposterous 'tin man' figure who wishes to freeze them and then encase them in ice for his grotesque and macabre grotto of horrors, as well as more significantly the moment when they breach the ice cave and enter into the glorious and magnificent late afternoon sunshine. This is very reminiscent of a tale told about young Buddhist monks training to be lamas in the Himalayas, (whether it is just apocryphal or actually real, I have no idea), but it goes like this; they are separated from their parents (at least they have them, unlike Logan's dystopia world - again, itself reminiscent of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World - brilliant book by the way, must read it if you haven't done so already) when they are just a few weeks or months old, or perhaps once they are fully weaned; then they are kept away from ever observing the Sun directly, apparently until they are seven years old, at which point they are awoken early one morning, to go outside and see the sun rising on a fine day, which must be an incredible experience, even the more powerful given that they've never experienced it before. So yes, there is a scene that echoes that in the film; obviously this fool's paradise chamber of a world they live in is situated somewhere near Washington DC in modern day America, and I believe the eccentric but likable cat-man is in the Library of Congress or somewhere akin, and they pass the Abraham Lincoln Memorial on their way to meeting him. If nothing else, this film is thought provoking and so I believe 7/10 is justified, given that the film starts off by engendering a very great level of despair for society, but redeems itself later on, when the two escapees are able to experience true nature for the first time, and eventually ends triumphantly with the overthrow and downfall of the established but pointless order.",Logan's Run
155,DaCritic-2,This one didn't age well,3,17 November 2000,"This was the coolest movie in the world, in 1976.  Unfortunately, it was the last of its kind ... the last big science fiction epic before George Lucas changed the face of that genre on film.Michael York and Jenny Agutter are good in their roles (I've always though jenny was a hottie anyway <grin>), and the story is interesting, but as somebody else pointed out, it all looks WAY too 1976, in the same way that the Buck Rogers television show from the same era remains a relic of that era, rather than a ""glimpse of the future.""One of the big selling points of this movie when it came out was that Farrah Fawcett-Majors was in it ... she had just become popular at the time the movie was released, and had filmed it when she had still been pretty obscure.  If the movie had been filmed six months later, I don't doubt that she would have been chosen to play Jessica (the female lead).  In fact, though, Farrah just has a bit part; maybe five lines, and she's onscreen for just a few minutes.There's really no reason to see this movie unless (a) you like campy movies, or (b) you saw it when it was originally released and want to see it again for the nostalgia factor.In the original book, people were allowed to live to age 21; in the movie, the age was changed to 30 (presumably to accommodate the stars chosen for the roles).

158,santegeezhe,"A Fun, Campy Ride",6,7 November 2006,"First off, let me start by saying that I first saw this movie back in high school when one of my teachers showed it to us. I'm not really sure why - maybe she was just trying to kill time. In any event, she took great pains to explain the plot to us thoroughly, and had she not done so, I really don't know if I'd have understood what the hell was going on, because this is one confusing and convoluted screenplay. However, that's really my only criticism, because other than that this is a pretty entertaining flick.This movie was made one year before Star Wars, but it might as well have been twenty based on the primitive special effects. It's almost laughable really, but the film is so earnest in its attempts to show a creepy vision of the future that it eventually overcomes one's temptation to bust out laughing.This film really does evoke a troubling vision of the post-apocalyptic future. The outside world has been rendered unlivable through pollution and war, and the people are forced into giant, domed cities where they live out their lives with only hedonistic pleasures in mind. Not a bad life really, except that anyone who reaches 30 must take part in the ritual of ""renewal"", during which they're blasted into infinity, never to return again. Naturally, this is all controlled by a not-so-benign computer system. The more clever elements of the society figure out that ""renewal"" is a crock and attempt to escape, becoming ""runners"" who are in turn pursued by ""Sandmen"" - sorta like the KGB of the future - whose job is to terminate them. There's your plot outline.Now, throw in some cheesy set design, horrible acting, hilarious dialogue, a touch of gratuitous nudity, and you have a recipe for a pretty fun time. Bear in mind that this movie will seem very dated to jaded 21st century eyes, and it's perhaps a tad too long, but it's still a movie that I enjoy very much, and one that I've watched many times.

Also, regarding the production design and f/x in general: before Star Wars, major studios could get away with a lot of the cheesy stuff in the movie, like those interstellar flare guns, and the shopping mall dressed up with a few mirror and neon sculptures to create a ""city of the future"".

166,kgehebe,Science Fiction Classic with Thoughtful Ideas,9,24 February 2020,"It's a shame that you need to go back 44 years to find a thoughtful Science Fiction film where the special effects are secondary to story and themes, but here we are. Originally when I first saw Logan's Run, it was on television after a successful theatrical release and even if edited for TV, movies on TV were a big deal for Gen X kids in the 70s. At the time, I liked the futuristic setting, being a Planet of the Apes and Twilight Zone fan growing up. However, you really need to see this as an adult to get a full appreciation for it. It's a Message Movie for sure and if that's not your cup of tea, don't bother.In the year 2274, the world has been destroyed by wars and environmental disasters. Humanity now lives in a domed city, controlled by Computer, where all of your fantasies and desires are available to you. The only catch is, when you are 30, you have to submit to Carrousel, an event where you have a chance at Renewal, where you are reborn and live again (or so says Computer), but you will actually be killed while a crowd of onlookers cheers. It's really a totalitarian society, controlled by Computer, but everyone is conditioned into thinking that it's Utopia. There are some who refuse to submit to Carrousel and become Runners in search of Sanctuary, a mythical society on the Outside where Runners can live on past 30 and grow old. Logan is a Sandman, a type of law enforcement officer for the New Order, dictated by Computer, where he hunts down Runners and kills them if they refuse to submit to Carrousel on their 30th birthday.After awhile, Logan is ordered by Computer to investigate Sanctuary on the Outside and has his crystal Life Clock fast forwarded 4 years. When realizing his time is up, he too becomes a Runner. His best friend, Francis, who is also a Sandman, must hunt him down along with Jessica, a fellow Runner, who wants to reach Sanctuary too. After a series of narrow escapes with various bad guys, they reach a frozen cave and meet Box, a killer robot who freezes Runners before they can get to Freedom. Again, narrowly escaping death from Box, they get Outside and see the Sun for the first time. The domed city is near the old Washington D.C., now run down and virtually destroyed by wars fought centuries ago. They meet Old Man and are stunned to see a person who is older than 30. They are enraptured by stories of his parents, long dead, that were married and the concept of a couple staying together for love and children and being remembered after death. From here, the movie has a very satisfying ending.I'm not giving the movie 10 stars only because it could have been better with tighter editing and it drags in spots. I think Old Man should have had more depth and character development. Old Man is the moment of Logan's Truth but he's merely a one dimensional back drop. Yet aside from some problems, this movie leaves you with deep themes, Empty Consumerism, Loss of Individualism, Societal Stagnation, Truth, Love and Spiritual Revelation. Yes, the set reminds me of Epcot Center at Disney World Meets a Shopping Mall in New Jersey but that's hardly the point. What a tragedy an entire generation has been taught that if a movie doesn't have mind blowing special effects, it doesn't have anything to say.",Logan's Run
167,Dr-RJP,Classic Sci-Fi flick that only suffers from a very-spoiled audience!,9,10 December 2005,"Remember when class sci-fi flicks were lauded more for their plot than their special effects? ""Day the Earth Stool Still,"" ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" are two that come to mind. The viewing public is spoiled by CG effects, and anything that is not CG looks dated. The special effects in Logan's Run were very good in their own right. Caroussel, the Love shop, and the Mind probe are examples. What I find very interesting in reading the other reviews is that none mentioned the ELECTRONIC MUSIC!! Music can make or break a movie and the electronic music in Logan's Run is what really gave it its futuristic flavor (even if the Disco costumes did not).The REAL plot of the story is a metaphor for the class warfare that was really happening in America during the late 60's and early 70's, due in large part to Vietnam, the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, the Civil Rights movement, among others. Class warfare in the sense of the younger generation being sent off to Vietnam by the older generation. The message was, ""Do not trust anyone over thirty!"" And so, what better Utopia for the younger generation than one in which there is none older than 30!"" Rather than go onto more detail, this movie is a must-see for the messages it delivers. Don't get hung-up on the datedness, or the costumes, or the special effects. See it for the great acting and pulse-pounding action sequences as Logan begins his real run.",Logan's Run
168,Fred_Mopkopf,Underrated because of flaws that have to do with its era,8,1 November 2020,"Another film that easily gets dismissed by know-it-alls of all ages because it's not as perfect as it could have been, at least of viewed from a contemporary vantage point. Yes, the special effects in the opening scene give away too easily the model work due to the unfortunate bokeh; yes, the production and costume design as well as the hairstyle are a bit all too seventies; yes, Michael York delivers some of the more ham-fisted scenes in movie history (watch him throwing his fists enthusiastically sideways in the carousel, or shouting 'you can live!' near the movie's end, which are both examples of good stage acting, by the way); yes, Box is one disco king of a robot. But the story remains a very good one, and especially the journey outside the domed city to overgrown Washington D. C. is one of the best of its kind - for the time. I always wished the whole exploration part could have been longer (something the TV series wanted to offer, but in my opinion they seriously botched it and/or were hampered by low budget). I really hope that Michael Bay's shameless rip-off 'The Island', which killed off any remake plans for the time being (yes, it is a rip-off, hasn't anyone noticed the name of Tom Lincoln's boat? It's 'Renavatio'), is old enough now to allow a remake. Anyway: Until the time comes, give the original a try. And do so with some mercy regarding the seventies style. At least it's the reason why Logan has a beautiful de Sede sofa in his appartment. If only I could afford one.",Logan's Run

The timer on your wrist goes off; that's it; your time is up; off to the carousel you must go, to be 'renewed'.  But, you are not renewed, you die by laser beam instead; its a con. Sounds familiar does it not?  You can try to 'run', become a runner; but a sandman will probably get you - with a laser - you die anyway. A lucky few may make it 'outside' to 'sanctuary'.  There's an outside?  You never knew? You have been told something very different: there is only the city; no other world; no other way of life. How do you know your life is what it seems.  What have you been told?  We are 'sealed' in this universe; in this timeframe. There is no 'outside' - how do you know?  Has anyone tried to 'run'?  Has anybody made it 'outside'.

170,Jackkrsk,"""For Sci-Fi fans, who wants to watch Pre-Star Wars films, I recommend this picture"".",8,15 August 2013,"The MGM Sci-Fi flick Logan's Run (which was theatrically released on June 23, 1976) is one of those films that relates the idea of isolated society versus the outside world, just as seen in the movie ""The Truman Show"". The specific genre of the Logan's Run is a futuristic dystopian/Sci-Fi film (Just in case if you don't know what dystopian means in our current era : A dystopia is a community or society, usually fictional, that is in some important way undesirable or frightening.). The movie was made on a big budget of $9,000,000 - a budget similar to the well known Sci-Fi 2001 : A Space Odyssey (1968).This futuristic story takes place in the year 2274 (23rd century). The survivors of a holocaust now live within an isolated city called Domed City. There men and women are only allowed to live until 30-years old due to population control and limited resources. At 30 the people have two choices: They can either take part in a extermination ceremony called ""Carousel"" where they are promised a rebirth or they can go on the run and escape to outside the Domed City.Michael York portrays the main protagonist named Logan 5, who is a Sandman (police assassin). His main job is to terminate and hunt down all ""Runners"" who refuse to be exterminated on Carousel and escape to outside the city. Logan finds a symbol and the computer, that controls all life in the city, gives him a secret assignment: find and destroy a mysterious place called Sanctuary by disguising himself as a runner. He must also erase the last four years of his life from the crystal on his pawn. Logan ends up on the run himself and hunted by his partner and best friend Francis 7. He and a beautiful woman named Jessica 6 (portrayed by Jenny Agutter) end up working for an underground resistance group helping all Runners search for Sanctuary escapes. They manage to escape from the Domed City and find themselves in a devastated Washington D.C, where they discover another world. Realizing there is much to live for, Logan begins to question the system. It's at this point in the film that they discover and befriend an elderly man (played Peter Ustinov).Farrah Fawcett, then recognized as a blonde sex symbol, is cast in this film in the supporting role of Holly, a woman who works in the face surgery department. Even though I am a movie buff of both old and contemporary films, I found most of the visual effects cheesy and outdated. Here's a moment of the movie that shows an unrealistic and outdated visual effect: Logan and Jessica look at the Abraham Lincoln in the Lincoln Memorial, which showed an art painting effect style. It would have been better if the Abe Lincoln statue had been made by the film production team. Today I find films from the 1970s, showing an art painting effect style, to be very outdated.The way that most of the cast played their characters was actually not bad at all. If anybody is big into science fiction, you will be entertained by the acting performance of the characters. The concept of the performance of the movie is pretty much the same way as the acting from the old 1930s & 40s Sci-Fi short subject films just like Flash Gordon. The way the cast spoke their lines and acted out on their characters mimicked the earlier style of Sci-Fi shorts.The film score that Jerry Goldsmith composed for the film, I found really catchy. Mostly the sounds and chorus of the score are what make the score so catchy. The moment during the score when it sounds epic is when Logan and Jessica get out of the ice cave into the outside world. For Sci-Fi fans, who wants to watch pre-Star Wars films, I recommend this picture. There are other great Sci-Fi pictures that came out before George Lucas released Star Wars - like Metropolis (1927), The Time Machine (1960), and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).I give that film a 3 out of 4 stars.",Logan's Run
171,rhyatt1,Could have been a good movie,1,6 August 2007,"*Contains Spoilers*This movie could have been pretty decent considering the material it was based on. I never read the book myself because reading takes too much time and energy and I'm lazy, but it's easy to see the story could be compelling.The problem is that nothing is ever explored in detail or adequately explained. For instance, the entire point of the movie is that when you turn 30 you're killed off at ""carousel"". Logical reasoning would be that this is done to avoid overpopulation in a domed city. OK, that makes sense if the outside world is uninhabitable as seems to be the suggestion. But that theory is destroyed in the middle of the movie when Logan and the girl leave the dome and wander around outside. OK, so if it is possible to live outside then why have a society in a dome for one thing, and secondly why randomly kill people to avoid overpopulating a dome that isn't necessary? It seems the easy solution would be to have the ""elite"" or the ""chosen"" live in the dome and maybe kick them out at age 30 to live with the undesireables, but there's no reason to kill them. It's just a random plot device for the sake of building a fake world and a story. Later in the movie an old man is discovered who lives outside and is perfectly healthy for a crazy old dude.. proving that the only real problem with the outside world is that there are no resources. But that could easily be changed by building a Hilton and a Wal-Mart.Maybe in the book nobody can live outside, but once again I didn't read the book and I'm not reviewing that. I'm reviewing the movie, dummy. That's right, I called you dummy.Another problem I have with the movie is that there is no explanation at all as to who runs the domed city. There is a computer with a female voice who guides the group of Sandmen (cops), but there has to be more to it than that. Is this computer just a suped-up version of Windows Vista that gained intelligence? And what authority does it have to run a dome city? It's a freaking computer that (as we find out at the end of the movie) can just be shot with one blast and destroyed. So the obvious question is who programmed the computer and put it in charge? Plus how does this infamous computer keep tabs on what's going down in the city? In this ""futuristic"" movie the people don't even have cell phones yet they could build an intelligent supercomputer to run a city? Makes sense.Other things that don't make sense: -The ""runners"" are sometimes just randomly running circles around the mall area when the police are after them. Seems like they would go outside or actually hide somewhere, but I guess seeing someone get blasted for running is better than seeing someone run to a closet to hide.-The people never know their parents because they are told they're reborn after being killed at age 30. So are people making babies or are the babies just genetically created. There is no explanation if there are people making babies the old fashioned way and it's a cover-up or what. -The random collection of dirties living in the run-down dome area. Are these guys just runners who were too lazy to find sanctuary or what? Obviously the sandmen know they're down there so why not just wipe them out? They don't seem to put up much of a fight so might as well just murder them all.-The robot in the ice area. Are you kidding me with this mess? I know the special effects were bad in the 70's but come on. I've seen trash cans that looked more like robots than this guy. Plus who is he anyway? And why does he freeze runners in ice and store them all naked in a cave? Is the robot just a perv or what?One last problem with the movie was the overall lack of 70's nudity to make the movie watchable and transition the scenes. Yeah there were some 2 second glances, but that ain't cutting the mustard. Seriously, when you've got a skinny dipping scene that doesn't show any nudity then you've got problems. I mean, I don't like nudity or something..Overall I would say either don't watch this movie ever, or read the book. But then again what if the book is no good? You might as well just watch the movie and get it over with and then write a funny review about it.",Logan's Run
172,brianwolters,Stunning SCI-FI,7,4 January 2005,"Logan's Run is a dazzling sci-fi film. It is set in a very ""alien"" future of the United States; only everyone is forced to live indoors in a ""City of Domes."" Society is peaceful and fun loving. When you reach 30, you are to renew your life through a ritual or never live again. The story of Logan's Run is quite frightening. Director Michael Anderson does a fantastic job of keeping the frightening aspects of the story going. From the pleasant yet somewhat menacing voice of the main computer to the idea behind the ""Carousel"", you never for a minute doubt what is going on and you really pull for the central characters. The DVD transfer is good, probably as good as they are going to get, because some scenes of the film always looked a little ""muddy."" The enhanced soundtrack is in Dolby and while not 5.1, is still sounds much better than the VHS. The commentary is good but nothing spectacular. And the widescreen is really nice!A word of caution. While the film is rated PG, there are several scenes of brief nudity, one of which really doesn't further the plot any and is unnecessary (in fact, in the commentary, the scene takes the director by surprise and he says he forgot about it). The other is an elaborate scene in the ""love shop."" Despite that, there is very little graphic violence and little to no profanity. Logan's Run is a solid film. It looks a little dated now, but still entertains!",Logan's Run
173,Tom-91,Not without problems ....,8,18 July 2007,"This is another pre-'Star Wars' film of the 1970s that gave it the ol' college try on effects .... though unlike other films, this one actually did accomplish quite a bit. The production design was superior, though it is hard to not look at actors on wires .... with the wires so clearly visible and not clap your hand over your eyes. While the miniature buildings were really nice, there were too many obvious clues that this was a miniature, and not really what you were supposed to be seeing.This film does come across as a bit dated, though at the time, it was deeply important. For younger folks: the late 1960s and 70s was the time when the baby boomers were starting to exercise their political muscle, and there was great controversy about this young generation ""taking over"", and there were many films about the youth of America taking over. Drugs and sex and a lot of other taboo topics were also coming into mainstream. Fast forward on this trend for a few hundred years ...... and the director attempted to show this could be an outcome: all the pleasure you could want without any responsibility ..... until you reach 30. Logan's Run shows the obvious weakness of this extension ..... a homogeneous hive-like society is no closer to a real society than a beehive is. This is the reason behind one of the great criticisms of the film: why only white people? Answer: it is another weakness of the society ..... they are completely homogeneous, and freed from thought which differences might trigger.The one main weakness I see in this film is the scene with Box. I know it was there because otherwise there is no action between the escape and Washington, but still ..... this entire scene could have been removed (unless of course they were looking for one more reason for Jenny Aguter to remove her clothes).There was no real problem with the acting ..... though I think this film is ripe to be re- examined, not only with better effects when needed, but perhaps with a better overall concept of emphasizing the emptiness of a society run like this one.",Logan's Run

(First 90' Sci-fi that comes to mind except the Phantom Menace which doesn't count, and the Matrix, which I call an exception,)  This movie reminded me so much of the things that that era will be remembered for. The Sexual Revolution, Resisting Authority, etc. Am I the only one who thought this movie was sexy in a campy, silly way? Never would I have thought Michael York could be so cool, but I only know him from Austin Powers.  Of course, he and Jessica HAVE to get into furs to keep warm.

176,matris1,"Viewing through the lens of a 70s movie, it's pretty good.",7,18 April 2021,"The good: Pretty much hits the beats of a 70s dystopian movie. Angular architecture, bold colours, promiscuity, 70s hair. It's what you expect, and it's what you get. The establishing shots, mostly using miniatures are also pretty good. I mean they're obviously miniatures but that aside, they hold up better than 90s CGI. There's enough care put into the world, sets and costumes to make you believe you've been transported to a dystopian future (set in in the 70s).The Bad: Whilst the main cast all play their parts, there are no stand outs here - except maybe the *spoiler* man in a supporting role. Some of the dialogue (and delivery) is also quite cheesy - some of this is a product of its time, but mostly not, when you're reminded that Star Wars came out the following year and The Godfather a few years before this. The guns are also laughable and were notoriously unreliable on the set - and it shows.Should you watch it? If you want to see a dystopian movie that hits all the tropes, then yes. It's bold, psychedelic and striking - with great care put into the sets and set pieces.

177,JunkieJoe,Oh yeah...I love this movie,8,11 April 2003,"Logan's Run is one of those movies that hypnotized you if you saw it when it was released.  Something about it is forever etched into your psyche; could it be death at thirty, complete hedonism, hope for humanity?  Can't say for sure, but Logan's Run goes after it all.Released prior to Star Wars which revolutionized the way special effects are done, the effects are most definitely cheesy.  The acting is a bit on the thin side, but my theory is that it is purposely that way; illustrating the child-like acceptance of the way the world is around them.  The DVD contains many excellent features, which gives the true fan lots of background into the film.I have tried to explain this movie to friends who are not of my age group, without success.

The movie is a drastically dumbed-down version, a typical Hollywood mess. If someone were to really film the novel then we'd have something! All the griping aside, Logan's Run is interesting camp. The model of the future city is delightfully overdone, the long scenes filmed in the Dallas Apparel Mart will make you gasp at the architectural horrors of bygone days, plus you get to see lots of iconic movie stars as very young people.

179,Morlock,A science fiction film that gives the genre a run for its money,8,11 October 1998,"Beyond the entrapment of lavish special effects (for which ""Logan's Run"" won an Oscar anyway), few science fiction films actually present a good story, much less one that makes you think and/or presents new ideas.  ""Logan's Run"" is one of those few.Before ""Stars Wars"" enraptured audiences with its stunning special effects and created a precedent for a string of similarly effects-laden knock-offs and genre wanna-be's (mirroring what ""The War of the Worlds"" had done for audiences in the 50's), true science fiction films such as ""Logan's Run"" were giving us stories simply complimented by special effects, not about them.  I say ""true"" because ""Star Wars"" is of the fantasy genre; it is not a science fiction story, though it does share some common elements.""Logan's Run"" presents us with a vivid, somewhat horrifying vision of a possible future.  It doesn't take place ""a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.""  It happens on earth in a believable time frame.  It doesn't ask us to greatly suspend disbelief by accepting alien races and magic powers. Instead, it presents us with a chilling fast forward of our own technology, attitudes, and policies.  Concerning the latter, the film includes an almost creepy euthanasia undertone to it.Though, in all honesty, I care more about and become more closely associated with the characters in ""Star Wars,"" the disassociation I feel for LR's characters somewhat aids the lack of individuality that the story tries to convey.  The actors, however, give great performances.Beautiful cinematography and settings greatly compliment the film's mood and timeframe, from the sterile domed city to the decimated Washington D.C., which still provides one of (if not) the best visuals of a post-apocalyptic world that I've ever seen.  It's right there with ""The Planet of the Apes'"" Statue of Liberty.Another thing that SW does well is disassociate itself from the decade in which it was created.  You have to overlook this aspect in LR because like so many films of the 70's, it carries its decade's time stamp.Though minor, another thing I, in particular, enjoy about LR are the weapons.  Unlike every other weapon in and out of science fiction history, LR's ""blasters"" do not actually shoot anything.  There is simply an explosion at their designated target.  It may be campy (or corny), but it's definitely different and a fine example of real, working props.Another interesting note: the film varies greatly from the original novel, but most people agree that the film is much better.  I tend to agree with them.For me, in terms of science fiction, ""Logan's Run"" takes its place among such decade-defining films as ""The War of the Worlds"" (50's) and ""The Planet of the Apes"" (60's) and among such thought-provoking science fiction as ""Soylent Green"" and ""Gattaca.""Ask yourself this: what or where is ""sanctuary?""  Isn't that what we're all looking for?  Answer both, and you'll have the film's theme.",Logan's Run

The hair, the costumes, and the ""futuristic"" design just scream ""70s"" at you. The special effects, viewed through today's eyes, are certainly dated, but this movie came out about a year before George Lucas revolutionized special effects with Star Wars.

I just bought this movie from the bargain bin at the local Best Buy, and I was glad I did. Perhaps it is the message that there is much more to life than hedonistic pleasure, or the adventure of two people finding out the truth of their existence, I'm not entirely sure. All I'm saying is that if you can overlook the dated aspects of this flick, there is an enjoyable tale to be told. I give it a 7/10.P.S.: Earlier, someone kept referring to a Nuclear Holocaust for the reason the Domed City is built.

That being said, I thought the majority of the special effects were pretty cheesy. The laser effects were pretty good, but that was about it. The story was also a bit too cheesy for my taste. I'd like to think that a culture so advanced would know better than to exterminate people at the age of 30. After the apocalyptic event (which they never mention specifically what it was) that destroyed the world, you would think people wouldn't do things even more foolish, but they do, apparently. The acting was, at times, rather mediocre. My whole reason for watching it was to understand references made of this movie in TV shows and other movies.

Here, in this bubbled society, the young, healthy, beautiful people who populate it live in total and complete pleasure, free of labor & strife, and free to do anything & everything they want, sexually or otherwise. It's a total state of hedonism.But there's one catch: no one is allowed to live past the age of 30. On your 30th birthday (known as ""Lastday""), the little jeweled lifeclock attached to your hand blinks, and you must be expelled from this society of pleasure through an arena event known as ""carrousel,"" in which, the city's young people believe, your soul is ""renewed,"" afterwhich you will be reborn into the city's society and start all over again.But some 30 year-olds in this city know the real truth about carrousel---that it is, in fact, a death sentence---and they try to escape. They're called ""runners."" The domed city has a faction of policemen who hunt down runners, and they're called ""Sandmen."" Logan (Michael York) is a 26 year-old Sandman. Life in the city is good for him, but suddenly, he is given a secret mission by his boss---the city's master computer---that will change him. Logan's assignment is to go undercover as a runner, escape the city and go outside, where he is to find a so-called haven for escaped runners called Sanctuary, and destroy it. But Logan soon learns the truth about carrousel himself, and, with the aid of a beautiful girl named Jessica (Jenny Agutter), whom he falls in love with, he must now figure out how to free his people from their horrible fate at the age of 30....1976's ""Logan's Run"" is an all-time science fiction classic, and one of my personal favorite films ever since I first saw it on TV as a kid. I've always been fascinated by the storyline, and although the film's Oscar-winning visual effects have long since been surpassed, they're still quite colorful to look at (including the groundbreaking use of holography). There's fine performances all around, such as the perfectly-cast Michael York as Logan, the very lovely Jenny Agutter as Jessica (she & York have terrific chemistry together), as well as the delightful Peter Ustinov as Old Man (who Logan & Jessica discover living alone with his cats outside the city), Richard Jordan as Logan's best friend Francis, and there's even an enjoyable appearance from Farrah Fawcett (Majors) in her sexy, 70's prime, as an attractive assistant working in a facelift shop called New You. And director Michael Anderson steers the film quite nicely from beginning to end.Some have criticized ""Logan's Run"" as being too long, saying that the film bogs down in the middle when Logan & Jessica get outside the city and meet the Old Man. I say hogwash---I've always enjoyed this part of the film, featuring Ustinov's charming turn as the Old Man. Besides, it's an important part of the story, as Logan & Jessica fall in love with one another, and learn through meeting the Old Man that there IS, in fact, life after 30. Without this segment of the film, ""Logan's Run"" would be pointless. It's there for a reason, and I like it just as much as the rest of the film.Upon it's release in 1976, ""Logan's Run"" was arguably the ""hippest"" sci-fi film ever made up to that point. Then, of course, the original ""Star Wars"" was released the following year, which pretty much knocked ""Logan's Run"" off the sci-fi pedestal.

The acting was heinous, the editing (and I almost never notice bad editing) was jerky, the plot was idiotic and the tempo was leaden and boring. I hated it from start to finish, and I hated myself for renting it and for putting myself and my girlfriend through it's awfulness. I'm very lucky we're still an item after my making such a violent and unprovoked assault on her sense of good taste.Reading the other reviews here makes me wonder if I was even watching the right movie! Their's sounds reasonably good. Mine was totally inane and dull; even the random and inexplicable scenes of acid porno couldn't rescue this wretched turkey.",Logan's Run
186,JMASTERprime,God have mercy!!!!!!!!!,1,9 July 2006,"This movie is the worst movie I have ever seen. This production features the all-time worst actor-performances I have ever seen (except for soap operas). I couldn't finish it. This movie is full of embarrassing clichés mixed with bad acting. Some people may not agree with me but I will just have to say that those people have bad taste. I have seen a lot of good movies and a lot of bad ones but this is TERRIBLE!!!!! Arnold Schwarzenegger movies suck to but they are at least cool. This is just embarrassing and terrible. The pictures of the city are obvious miniatures which makes you wonder if you are in some kids room ore if your watching a movie. And haven't even started on the story. Its a terrible story that makes little sense and that makes my head ache. Micheal York is surprisingly bad, however he is not the worst thing in this production. Jenny Agutter sure has a nice body but she is a terrible actor. The only thing in this production that isn't really terrible is Peter Ustinov who actually gives an even performance (still not that good). So basically Michael Anderson harmed the world of film seriously when making this movie. TERRIBLE!!!!!!!",Logan's Run
187,jlease-1,Still worth the watch 30 years later,9,11 April 2007,"This movie, though a product of it's time, the glorious 70's, has staying power. Sure, special effects have advanced greatly, and a remake would be much more visually believable, you have a feeling that the entire movie is shot in a mall while inside the 'City'. But get past that, and watch the film. The acting, with Peter Ustinov, Michael York and Richard Jordan carrying the entire film mostly, is extremely well done. Jenny Agutter is young and cute in the film, which is about all her character requires. It's an interesting statement of a society that gets a little out of hand with it's youth worship, holding up a mirror to our own. It's especially poignant if you saw it yourself when you were under 30, and see it again at a 'maturer' age. Farrah Fawcett has a brief role here, and Agutter has a nice brief nude scene. The scenes of Washington DC are memorable even by today's technology standards.",Logan's Run

Michael York? Oh God how bad. The ""special effects"" weren't even slightly special (and could hardly be called effects). THIS received a special Oscar? For me managing to stay awake the Oscar should have gone to ME. The miniatures...oh, and the laser guns. The guns were sparklers. Really, there are better gun effects for toys purchased at the Dollar Tree. I actually wondered at some points if the director was trying to make some sort of awful commentary with these idiotic effects. Really, there were no redeeming things about this movie. How can this have been greenlit with such a bad script and SFX budget? Please save yourself. Don't see this movie.",Logan's Run

The campy feel of the technology does not deter from the impact of this ageless film. People today tend to get hung-up on technology and forget the value of the story and the acting. I believe a lot of viewers today probably will not understand this film, and people who didn't get it back in the 70's probably still don't get it. The social statement is so true it's not even funny. We do not like old people. Just look around at print media, advertising, Hollywood, music, or sports. We treat older people like the plague.",Logan's Run
191,Deleauvive,Not that good,5,26 August 2012,"Don't watch it if you're about to turn 30! Seriously, I didn't find this movie very entertaining. The first part, when Logan is a respected Officer (a top rank Sandman) and assumes his hedonist way of living felt contrived. It got better when he joins the refugees (Runners) but not by much. Then, there are all these campy sci-fi elements to consider, which don't fit so well (flashy colors, endless laser firing scene into the extermination arena)... I am sure many will disagree, but this is how I felt about it anyway.I usually don't mind at all dated effects in 70s/80s flicks by the way. As a side note, Peter Ustinov had its moments as the Old Man. The discussions from this moment on succeed in straightening the movie somehow. Even though many years separate them, I was reminded Equilibrium (2002) while watching Logan's Run.

The use of miniatures for the city is obvious, the special effects for the guns are laughable (it appears they used lighters and flares to create the effect), some of the more intricate costumes look like cheap plastic, etc... But I still strongly recommend watching this movie.The setting is intriguing, the story is unique, the acting is solid, and it is a worthwhile Sci-Fi experience.If you are a fan of science fiction who can look past dated effects, you will enjoy this movie a lot!",Logan's Run
194,sowr,Still Engaging,9,28 April 2012,"I'm sure I'm biased, as this was one of the first films I saw at the cinema as a young teen. I have seen it multiple times since and I still find it engaging. The opening sequence, shot long before CGI is well paced and perfectly balanced with the wonderful and somewhat groundbreaking score.The story is greatly simplified from the novel, to its credit. Logan (York) is essentially a murderous puppet of the regime - his growth to the conclusion of the story helps engenders sympathy towards him.Jessica (Agutter) is stunningly beautiful in a very classy way, and also goes through a metamorphosis along with Logan as together they stumble towards the truth surrounding the domed city in which they live and realize that love is the better way.Ustinov as the old man is perfect.The domed city is very well realized, I would say definitive until something better comes along.All in all I highly recommend this film, just don't expect CGI or sex or needless violence or dull, dreary grim proceedings similar to what science fiction films in the 21st century has become - is it because we're in the future we all yearned for and it didn't come true?",Logan's Run
195,Platypus-8,Origin of Basil Exposition,8,20 May 2002,"Having heard of the film's reputation, I took the opportunity when Target became sufficiently anxious to be rid of this merchandise that they marked Logan's Run on dvd down to 5.99. While some have praised the film for it's inclusion of landmark 70s bathing beauty Farrah Fawcett, I call this one of the film's low points. In addition, while the film generally portrays the future convincingly, the sets are somewhat bare. Furthermore, I do believe that the Old Man sequence is longish, though the old man is enjoyable to listen to.So those are the flaws as I see them. On the other side, Michael York is a pleasant changeup from more typical scifi stars. The effects were as enjoyable as the contemporary Black Hole. Most importantly, the film contains something that is integral to science fiction yet has been regularly left out since the work of Jules Verne and others. Here I speak of genuine intelligence and coherent philosophy. Enjoyable though the then-groundbreaking effects were, this alone sets the film apart. And let me finally state that I eagerly await the arrival of the wall-mounted Chick Generator Matrix from the folks at Bell Labs.",Logan's Run
196,dangermouse-4,"Sure it's campy, but that doesn't mean it's not great!",8,2 April 2004,"It's got plot holes, amateurish special effects, some ugly dialogue and one incredibly bad acting performance (Farrah Fawcett is just painful to watch here).  Yet I love this film.Perhaps it's the nostalgia factor as the movie oozes the 70s in almost every scene, right up to the disco ball of death at the top of Carousel.  The costumes, the haircuts, the music, the effects and the youth culture all contribute to bring me back to when I saw this movie as a kid.Or it could be Jenny Agutter.  I can't think of a more perfectly cast actress in a part in any movie.  She exudes youth, beauty and latent sexuality all framed by an incredibly innocent appearance and performance. Her damsel in distress part doesn't have a whole lot to it, but she does a damn fine job with what she's given.  Note the scene where she goes to Logan's door to lure him to his death.  You can see the conflict of guilt/duty play out in her eyes.  Props to Richard Jordan also for the delightfully manic Francis-7.Or perhaps it is the romantic in me, because at its heart Logan's Run is a love story.  And although the budding love between Jessica and Logan is underdeveloped (taking a back seat to the action) it's done well enough to make a simple line like ""Yes Logan"" (on the stairs outside of the Love Shop) hit me in a soft spot.I love the music too.  A great example is when Logan and Jessica first see the sun.  That's a home run shot.Whatever the reason Logan's Run remains a favorite to this day, almost 30 years later.",Logan's Run

Food, shelter, casual sex - the only bad thing, of course, was that you had to go on to the Carousel when you turned 30 and be ""renewed.""Actually, you COULD blame it on Jessica 6. She's the reason Logan went outside the city in the first place. Thru a series of misadventures outside of the city, Logan and Jessica come to believe in some truly stupid things. They decided that that wanted to get married and grow old together, after meeting a crazy old man who lived with a bunch of cats. Possessed by these crazy notions, Logan beats his best friend Francis 7 to death with the American flag(!), and decides to go back to the domed city and tell everyone his warped version of the ""truth.""In the end, driven by his madness, Logan 5 destroys the benevolent computers that run the domed city. As the city explodes, hundreds of thousands of people escape. Who will feed them? They have lived in the protective confines of the city all of their lives. They don't know how to grow food! (The old man even said earlier in the movie that all the fish in the rivers and lakes outside the dome were dead!) Winter is coming - who will clothe and shelter all of these people? All they have to wear are their colorful-but-thin satin togas! (And you know, the world is probably still radioactive outside the dome.)Of course, the movie ends before all of these poor people die of starvation and exposure. As the credits roll, Logan 5 is revered as some sort of hero. I guess you have to end the movie somewhere.But a couple of months after the movie ends, I'm sure the remaining survivors came to blame Logan for destroying their paradise, and Logan was probably forced to run again - from a lynch mob.",Logan's Run

I had grown up with a vague memory of this having been a terribly exciting film from watching it on TV as a boy.While the story has some thought-provoking twists, this movie has aged very badly. The acting, gender roles, soundtrack, and special effects are all hard to swallow. It's that much more remarkable that Star Wars came out the following year (1977).I'd recommend The Island (2005) and In Time (2011) as more modern and entertaining takes on the same story.

I saw it as a kid, then as a teenager, then as an adult and could still keep my eyes fixed on the screen from beginning to the end. Maybe, I'm biased since I'm a SciFi lover and I always had a crush for this period and style (THX1138, 1984, Brazil, Soylent green, etc.) but if you like a bit anticipation stories and want to spend an hour and half relaxing in front of a good ol'movie, then this one's for you.",Logan's Run

I like Michael York as Logan (also liked him as a musketeer) he is the most gentlemanly, polite and considerate character I have ever seen in a movie.

Those that want to live get hunted down, toyed with, and then killed by ""Sandmen"", judge jury executioners.Utopia with a frightening population control method. And even in a Utopian society, there were the juvenile delinquents, housed in ""Cathedral"". As much as it is enjoyable, I can fully understand why William Nolan was irked at the changes that veered away from his book. I had read the book several years before seeing the movie. I do think the original plot line would have made a great movie. Instead of 30 years old, and the carousel, it was 21 years old and Sleep. Francis is another Sandman, but he is a statistical anomaly, his life clock malfunctioned, it never changed from red to black, so he had lived a 'double lifetime' in disguise.Washington was devastated by a small dirty nuke, not overgrown, or overrun by cats and only having one person living there.

It opened the door for movies such as ""Star Wars,"" the ""Terminator,"" the ""Matrix,"" and ""X-Men"" movies. Now people look at it and they say, ""Well this does not add up to this new special effects story..."" It did not have any computer graphics and such as the new movies do these days. It did have a story, and a wonderful cast, and a hell of a director! The places it was filmed like the Dallas' World Trade Center, and the Zale Building,and the Ft. Worth Water Gardens were at that time the most modern and futuristic backdrops in which to film. The director Michael Anderson was very creative and he tried to show a perfect future that was flawed by human desires and frailty's. It was my first film experience, the first of six films I have been in. Just because it was filmed in Texas does not make it any less a wonderful piece of filmmaker's art.

Go watch it again, 40 somethings !!!

Most of the ingredients also appear in other similar movies of the time like ""Soylent Green"" or ""Rollerball"" for instance. The depicted world of Logan has no credibility to it whatsoever. No attention has been paid to detail, there's no sense of humor, all the futuristic apparatus look like rip-off from Star Trek. Yet, it's all too naive to make you feel touched by a sense of doom. Compare it to George Lucas' ""THX-1138"" and you know what I mean. The dialog is always straightforward, nobody - except maybe the Peter Ustinov-character - ever makes any casual remarks, the approach is so damn serious that at the end it just gets ludicrous. The very best thing about Logan's Run is Jerry Goldsmith's score.

213,rj0900,Why Logan's Run is the best movie ever made...,10,27 February 2009,"I've always felt guilty that I hadn't commented on Logan's Run before, since it's been my absolute favorite movie since I was lucky enough to see it in a theater when it first opened in 1976. Why do I love this movie so much and why do I believe that this is the best movie ever made? Those who are quick to point out it's lack of modern-day sophistication with it's somewhat dated special effects (you know, the type who watch a movie to look for mistakes) have really missed the sweeping grandeur and simple beauty in this movie. Few films are as good at the end of the movie as they are at the beginning. Logan's Run is just the opposite. It only gets better as it goes along. By the end of the film, one can be forgiven for feeling like he or she has experienced something so wonderful and compelling that few of us have ever really experienced in our hard-bitten modern day to day lives. The musical score alone is more than worth the price of admission and that's just one wonderful element of this magical film. But let me tell you why this film is so good: First, the story is simply superb. The world has experienced something apocalyptic, whether nuclear or environmental is unknown as it has happened so long ago. The survivors (at least those in this part of the world) have built a large domed city to keep them safe from the outside. In the centuries that followed, people have all but forgotten 'outside'. As Logan says, ""Outside? There's nothing outside."" All they know now is within the domed city. It has become a hedonistic place where every whim is at your fingertips, every pleasure is possible, every desire is fulfilled, nothing is forbidden. But, as the poster for the movie put it, ""...there's just one catch.""Naturally, being a limited space, population could quickly get out of hand. But the problem has been neatly solved in an unusual way. 30 years is all the life anyone gets. When you hit thirty, it becomes 'Lastday' and your only option is to ""try like hell"" for 'renewal' in a fiery ritual known as Carousel. It's something that everyone has been taught to believe can renew a persons life, allowing them to be reborn. But it's really a brutal form of population control. Naturally, as in every society, there are those who question the authorities and decide they'd rather live in the here and now. They decide to break the law and RUN. Some of them believe there is a place called Sanctuary where Runners can live in peace. That's where Logan comes in.Logan is a policeman called a Sandman who has always unquestioningly believed and followed the dictates of the city, as has most everyone else (sound familiar?). As a Sandman, Logan's job is to track down and eliminate Runners. And that's exactly what he happily does until one day when he is told that he must find Sanctuary and destroy it. Without giving away too much more, I'll say that things don't go along as he planned and with his new companion, Jessica, they eventually find there way outside the city into a world that's become an overgrown eden of sorts filled with the decaying ruins of deserted, vine covered cities.The world is unlike anything anyone has seen for hundreds of years and while they're at first shocked by the disorder and wild greenery everywhere, eventually they find there a freedom they could never have understood before. In the decaying ruins of the Capital D.C. they find 'Old Man', marvelously played by Peter Ustinov (the acting by all the principals is another reason to watch this movie), and through him they come to realize that they can live together in peace and grow old.Though they want very much to stay, they finally decide to do the right thing. I'll leave it to you to find out what that is. All I can say is, the ending of the movie is the most joyous I've ever experienced. Maybe you'll think so too.",Logan's Run
214,danielhalton,One Movie Buff's Opinion,8,12 December 2004,"This is most definitely a movie worth watching, and despite the 70s pre-Star Wars effects, it really has a very good story line and a pretty decently written script that is well acted.

The effects for the time are cheesy, but for the time they are quite good.

Some see this movie as dripping with 70's hedonistic liberalism; it in fact promotes monogamous love as a liberating force, and contains a message that is still relevant today.Great soundtrack by the prolific Jerry Goldsmith using (at the time) ground-breaking synthesizers combined with orchestra.",Logan's Run

219,pennys_sis,17 and IN LOVE,8,7 December 2005,"I only saw Logan's Run for the first time two nights ago, it was on cable, I loved it. Sure, its got old technology that is so obviously fake, but it more than makes up for it in story-line and acting. Although I don't (personally) agree with many of the statements the film has made (several religious undertones) I am deeply impressed with its use of symbolism. I look forward to seeing the new version of the film, and I've already seen the original twice (i taped it the following day!!!) But i don't think anything will beat the brilliant portrayal made by Michael York, especially in the scene before the final carousel ""ITS A LIE!! YOU DON""T HAVE TO DIE!!""

For a film supposedly way off into the future, no one who worked on the film thought that people should evolve to create some sort of futuristic society instead of producing a film about as interesting as a group of sheep in a cheap department store.The dialogue was certainly lacking, no true inner thought from the characters was forthcoming.Perhaps the director of this film should have watched The Time Machine and learned something.Definitely a movie with severe financial constraints.It was almost as bad as the Planet Of The Apes TV series. Ugh.2/10 - and that is generous.",Logan's Run
221,txfirebear,What a Delicious Turkey! So Good and So Bad at the Same Time,8,25 July 2005,"If you hate Sci-Fi, then don't bother. There will be so many things in this dated film to bug you, that there's really no point unless it's assigned for class. If so, I'd like to congratulate your teacher: Some of these concepts are timeless and presented in provocative ways. For instance, does God exist, or do we, similar to the way that the young people of Bubble City believe in Sanctuary, want and need God to exist? Another question the film asks us to ponder is something about the tendencies and the central essence of ""youth-based culture."" What's good about it? What's bad? Some of the questions this film asks (and Peter Ustinov's Eliot-spouting performance) are genuine joys within the muck of cheesy sets, effects, and cityscape models that look more like Avacado Mall than City of the Future. Auguter and York look beautiful (and have real chemistry between them), plus Richard Jordan's Francis 7 was so memorable, they had to bring back his character from the dead for the TV series. Not only do I love the quest or journey theme in this film, but pondering the movement inside Logan--from Sandman killer who never questions authority to lover/runner with Jessica as his muse and accomplice--makes for interesting arguments. For instance, what was Logan's relationship with Francis and did he betray his best friend because of being betrayed by the central computer? Would Logan have been able to love Jessica if he didn't realize that the central computer's teachings about love and commitment were flawed? Farrah's awfully pretty, and the look is so 70s you almost can't stand it, but all kitching aside, it's a fun run.",Logan's Run
222,thedudenextdoor89,"Good movie, but lacking in fundamental areas",6,22 October 2006,"The movie is well done, with excellent special effects for the era in which it was presented. The storyline is fast paced helping to keep you engaged through the entire movie. We follow Logan-5, a sandman, who's job is to nab 'runners' trying to escape their fiery demise in the bizarre ritual of 'carosel' upon their 30th birthday. Oh by the way, that's the price for living in paradise, you only get 30 years of it. Our setting takes place in a post-nuclear society in which the remaining humans take refuge in huge dome-like cities, cut off from the rest of the world. Under the control of a single 'master computer' like figure they live their existence, never questioning anything. Fate intervenes for our hero, and he to is forced to run (hence the title). Good start, in my opinion the characters are very two-dimensional. Story line is somewhat confusing and very slow in some parts. A good effort but this movie could have been a lot better. I give it 6/10",Logan's Run

The colors are great and the picture is very clear.I quickly get bored watching Turner Classic Movies channel (on Orbit) but this one caught my attention and I must say that it is very attractive to see through all the movie.One ""bad thing"" about the movie is their version of ""a computer"" which was done by placing what seems to be a large vegetable scale (the one you can find in groceries stores) and adding few more buttons to it. Another thing might be the voice of a woman that is shot to be killed.

It was his first ever Accadamy award winner. It won for best special effects and is considered the film that lead the way for the Star Wars special effects. My favorite part of the movie was the fact that my grandfather always used something about his family in all of his films. In the beginning of logan's Run, when everyone is headed into the first carousel. It is said that it is the carousel of Capercorn 15. (January 15) My birthday. Pretty cool,huh?

227,danger-mouse,"Somehow, I'm not sure how, but this is a great flick!",9,2 May 2003,"Okay, it's got a hoaky plot with lots of holes in it, special effects made from matchbox sets, some mediocre acting (Farrah Fawcett?!?) and dialogue, a big ole ""this was made in the 70's"" stamp all over it, and I think the editing, direction and sound track are lousy too.  And yet somehow it all works.  I love this movie! Maybe it's the campy cornball that gets me every time.  I dunno.  Yet by the end I feel uplifted and even touched.  What a great scene with the timid girl touching Ustinov's beard at the end with Logan and Jessica in each other's arms looking on.While the acting is average (or perhaps its the lousy script) there are exceptions, thankfully mostly among the main cast.  Richard Jordan is just great as the relentless and unremorseful sandman.  And Ustinov is a lot of fun as the kooky old man.  Michael York, who've I've always liked, is servicable as our hero (thankfully they don't ask him to stretch his acting skills too much here). But without a doubt the real jewel is Jenny Agutter as Jessica-6.  I can't recall a part more perfectly cast.  Ms. Agutter is the epitome of beauty, youth and doe-eyed innocence.  And her underlying sensuality is impossible to miss in every scene she is in.  And as if that weren't enough she can act to boot!Of course there's a lot that I don't like about the movie, it's quite easy to pick apart.  But again, I don't know how, ""Logan's Run"" is much better than the sum of its parts.I hope they get the rumored remake off the ground, there's some good underlying sci-fi to be explored here and with a tightened up script, upgraded effects, better direction and editing you could have *real* winner. I just don't think they'll ever match the original casting job for Jessica-6.",Logan's Run

229,public-971-833411,Freedom's just another word for nothing' left to lose,8,8 February 2011,"When this movie came out, it made such a huge impression on me that I went and made my own ""ankh"" and carried it in my pocket all the time, as if it might be the key to my own escape somehow. Then I got ""born again"" and I saw the movie as being atheist propaganda (there is no heaven), so I threw my ankh into the Sound. When a movie connects with a viewer that deeply, it's real art.Maybe it was the right movie at the right time for a trapped teenager. I'm not so sure it was the product of its age. By 1976, the revolution had already failed, there was no age of Aquarius, and the Summer of Love was just a silly phase a few people had gone through back when they were young. The reality of the mid-70s was inflation, gas lines, and disco music, not the search for freedom and the questioning of faith.I was astounded to see they made this whole movie for only $15 million. A decade ago, they paid Pierce Brosnan $15 million just to read his lines (actual acting would have cost more, presumably) in ""Dante's Peak"". Even though the model city with its model trains is pretty much straight out of ""Metropolis"", and actual locations were juxtaposed rather incongruously (California chaparral next to Texas water park next to kudzu-covered city), the sets are pretty good and do convey the sense of a very clean, pleasurable, Caucasian, and definitely indoor, society -- a suburban shopping mall, in other words. If nothing else, the concept and the story telling are good enough that they transcend some economies of production, and I'm the kind of guy who looks at the flashpots and wonders if the greenish tint is from zinc dust or barium chlorate.There isn't near so much '70s camp in LR as there was in, say, the Planet of the Apes sequels -- no ridiculous sideburns, unzipped shirts on male chests, urban-cool stereotype black guys, platform shoes, and polyester. I actually kind of like the idea of having a shopping mall stand in for the social and religious center of beautifully-trapped people. Shortly after the movie came out, a new shopping mall was built in Federal Way, and when I walked in and saw the sunken circular central court with its circular ceiling detail overhead, I thought I was walking into the Carousel and almost expected to be lifted up in the air.I do wonder what kids these days think about a period-piece like Logan's Run. It's all about freedom, but these days it's connectivity, rather than freedom, that seems important to the young people.",Logan's Run
230,gabreeze,Oh lighten up it's a great! (lots of spoilers inside),10,10 August 2005,"Most of the problems I've seen people have with the movie is the fact that they have never read the book. The movie is a great adaptation of the book, most of the locations are there, the domed city, the frozen cave, old Washington, etc., and the basic story is still intact.The book was written in the middle 60's when the whole youth rebellion - don't trust anyone over 30 was going on. I believe Mr Nolan and Mr Johnson turned the age of becoming legal (21) to a death sentence for their characters (it was moved it to 30 for the movie) so you can see in the book's future, Hippies will rule the world! MGM changed the whole youth dominated world to a giant future city complex. OK the carousel sequence didn't make sense but it was a lot more visually exciting than how people terminate themselves in the book (they report to suicide shops). It's like a lot of books, it's tough to transfer to the big screen but in my opinion, they did a pretty good job with this one. I saw it when I was 12 and was completely mesmerized by the concept, now that I'm older (and way past what would be Lastday) I still consider it one of my favorites. So if you liked the movie, check out the books! (There are 3) Also if anyone casting the rumored remake reads this, I vote for Leonardo DiCaprio to play Logan.And by the way, stop complaining about the effects! Yes I know you can do better effects with a Power Book and a copy of Final Cut but this was made in the 70s! Give em a break for crying out loud. - Thanks for reading my post.",Logan's Run

In an age of and time of social agitation, ethnic frustration. It seemed to reflect the true human dilemma,(Do humans have the ability to truly guide and direct other humans) or even more direct. Does one class or race have the right to dictate what the individual has the ability to do,(Make personal choices). Logan's Run provided both enlightening entertainment and had a truly profound message. The portrayal of characters blended well with the setting. However I do not see any need to update such a movie. It should be left as a marker of the time in which it was made.",Logan's Run
236,joseywales11,One of the greatest Science Fiction Films EVER!,10,14 February 2001,"If I hear one more person compare this film to Star Wars I am going start throwing empties at the screen, what a simple comparison.  Someone compare it to Star Wars Phantom Menace and the contect of that film.  Let's end the comparison discussion with GEORGE LUCAS CHANGED THE WORLD OF SCIENCE FICTION FOREVER.  The initial trilogy was arguable the greatest series of movies, not science finction movies, but movies at the time.  Star Wars is the highest grossing picture of all time after the re-release and when you consider merchandising it is by far the most successful film ever.  When people saw Star Wars they were not expecting what they saw, and it's acceptance by the public changed film forever.Now, Logan's Run is a science fiction film.  The first one to speak on a socialogical, romantic and intellectual level, (something a lot of people apparently missed).  The only other film to come close to this although there was no romantic element was ""Things to Come"" circa 1934.  And I will be happy to offer that effects did not change too much from that time up until Star Wars.  Clever cinematography was used in these antiquated films and technology slowly developed and special effects were developed.  Look how much technology has changed in the world in the ;last 20 years.  We have accomplished more in this time frame than we have through the history of civilization.  Logan's Run and Things to Come both comment on how Human developmentis halted because of war, not advanced.  Perhaps this can be likened as to how special effects were not a prioirty of America from '34-'76 witht the 3 wars the US wasinvloved in at the time. Now that relative peace has come, look what we accomplished.  The effects of Logan's Run, (although I was only 2 at the time) were indeed state of the art at the time, with a few poor shots where I picked up the floor burts on a strip of brown painted wood and also cuaght a glimpse of an exit sign, I was transported into another world.Many comments suggested that the film dates itself during the sex shop scene and Farrah Fawcett, who was a 70's icon.  People naturally relate her to Charlies Angels and the 70's, where is she now?  What do you associate Carrie Fisher with?  I do wish she wasn't part of this film.  Meanwhile, people forget that the world has been destroyed and people have lived in this domed-city environment for centuries, perhaps since the 80's we don't know when the war happened, so since advancement has stopped it is logical to suggest that the people stayed with what they knew, as this also may have been framed by big brother.While people say the acting was poor in this primarily British Cast, I thought that Michael York who I have always enjoyed and Jenny Agguter were phenomenal in their roles.  Understand the Sandmen were born sandmen aand had it programmed into them the beliefs of society, ""try like hell for renewal""  Indeed Michael York was serious in the role, I would like to have a serious cop on my block.  And today a cop is not born a cop, Michael needed to be serious for his role to succeed.  Jenny was fantastic, her inherint goodness and the uncertainty towards the Sandman (York) was well played.  Why she never became a major world-class star and icon I do not know, she is beautiful and a wonderful actress in Logan's Run and her other work.Bos was an excellent transition into the outside world, Peter Ustinov could not have played ""Old Man"" any better.  The eccentricities one must have living alone in the world could be seen and heard in his every movement and comment.Together Aggutter and York are the 2 ideal people from this civilization to enter first, the new world.  Reason, Intellegence, Strength and Love (something the people of the city don't possess), are combined in the 2 to make them the perfect Adam and Eve.  At the end of Logan's Run, York and Agutter in their performance truly capture, and are the epitome of the human spirit.Logan's Run is just that, a triumph of the human spirit.  Take another look at the film, ignore the cinematograpy and efects and comparisons to Star Wars, look at the commentary it makes.  Take it for what it was at the time, and take it for what it is today.  It is one of my favorite films ever.",Logan's Run
237,e-babe-2,"Disappointed, but entertained.",6,6 August 2007,"Having heard that this was a sci-fi classic, I'd hoped it might be in the same league as the Ridley Scott gems, ""Alien"" & ""Blade Runner"", but such was definitely not the case. The cast was terrific, but the production values were so bad, it was hard even to take this film seriously. The FX were bogus  even for 1976  and the props were as weak as those on the original ""Star Trek"" TV series. Don't get me wrong; I think many of the old, lower-budget sci-fi {futuristic} films are brilliant; ""Fahrenheit 451"", for example  but ""Logan's Run"" falls far short of the mark set by such 'genuine' classics. However, if you can get past all those minuses, the big plus is that this is a fun-to-watch sci-fi of the 70s and worth viewing when it plays on late-night TV, or some rainy afternoon. The great supporting role of Sir Peter Ustinov was short but juicy. Farrah Fawcett (really young) also makes a cute, little addition to the cast.",Logan's Run

Perhaps the 1976 refers to the date the movie was released on either VHS or Beta, rather than in the theaters. I would appreciate a comment either from the owners of this website or from somebody else. I also recall my friends seeing the picture in theatres in 1973. At any rate, prospective viewers should find the work amusing and entertaining. Michael York does a good job of playing a Sandman, the black clad political police of this future society, whose job it is to terminate citizens who do not obediently step onto the Carousel on their 30th birthday.

240,deadeye-dick,"The Book is much, much better!",2,20 March 2008,"This is a typical cheesy 70's Sci-fi movie. It attempted to be long on visual appeal while low on story line. Logan's Run like the current Bourne series is a film that could've been a masterpiece that rivaled the original Star Wars if it had followed the book. The book is a fast-paced action-adventure which follows Logan through his Last Day. Logan originally intends to run only to break a ring that helps members of the society escape mandatory death by the age 21 thus cementing his legacy. The only way this will work is if no one else knows what he's doing. During his adventure, Logan starts to rethink his blind acceptance of this policy and his role as a Sandman. In the book, Logan travels all over the world, not just in a enclosed Dome City. This would've helped the visual scope of the film making it more epic and less of a typical soundstage melodrama. Hopefully, Hollywood will take another look at the source novel and redo the more in a more faithful adaption.",Logan's Run

I was young then and just loved it as eye candy and the story didn't seep in as much as it does now. Looking back on it the ending is probably the most thought provoking part. SPOILER ALERT!!! Peter Ustinov's character is met by all the young people from inside the city. They have never seen someone old. It holds so much potential that they might learn from him and his experience of living alone with his cats for so long. Respect your elders LISTEN to them. They know what is going on (usually).

245,Screenmonkey,"Logans Run, is classic SF, Don't Judge It By...",10,19 January 2005,"Logans Run is classic Science Fiction (SF), Don't Judge It By Star Wars or Other SF after that time. At the time it was being made, ""Special Effects"" was more of a horror to Hollywood Studios than an attraction to them. Computers were nearly unheard of in film making. Budgets didn't permit computers or SFX en mass and Star Wars was a major exception. Logans Run had it's comparatively meager budget, and a Director has to make what he can, with what he's got financially available. At the time of it's release, it was considered to have very advanced SFX.To be fair, every film looks dated as SFX advances year by year, to include Star Wars, Jaws, 2001, they all look dated now. And none have a tenth of the story content that Logans Run does. (Digitally Updateing films like a mindless megalomaniac does not count here, we're talking the original product OK) It is always a great disappointment to come to this site and see so many people who are obviously young, born in the late 70's or 80's who have no clue or appreciation for what makes a great old film like this great. The constant and unoriginal cry for remakes of great films like this is sickening. What remake has ever been worthy of it's source material, not one. Imagine how Jerry Bruckheimer's production values would KILL this movie.That our culture has produced several recent generations of young people who can't see past a films ""primitive SFX"" and ""sets"" to actually get the ""message"" of this film is only indicative that Logans Run' message of the dangers of ""youth centered"" culture are dead on.Like much of 1970's Sci-Fi Cinema (Omega Man, Soylent Green, THX-1139) Logans Run is about one man (and one lovely lady) set against the much larger faceless oppression of the ""System"" whatever it may be.Put yourself in Logans shoes for a moment, everything you've ever known or believed is a lie, and you were part of what enforced that lie. Suddenly one day, circumstances and an alluring stranger demand that you give up all you hold true, and all you know as safe and comfortable, and you go against it all to run. Like joining a cult, only for once the cult is correct. You think you are running toward the lie to find the truth. And as your world falls apart around you, you realize you are running from a lie to the truth. This is Logans quandary, the world beyond the domes of his City are a terrible affirmation that the ""malcontents"" within the City are actually right.Logans run has amazing moments where the main characters experience fear, aloneness, and love for the first time. These are amazing scenes that show the mindless danger of Utopian existence over generations, and how dystopian visions of the future can still lead to human-kind finding a way to endure without the total destruction of the planet.Sure I love 1970's Sci Fi/SF, but you can't compare it to the modern stuff. Not SFX wise anyway. Movies were artistic and well written before George Lucas and Spielberg made SFX the prime motivators in film (along with mega budgets.) So I love the films that came before 1977, those that came before the utter stupidity of the mega priced ""blockbuster."" They don't have the budget and eye candy, but they do have something the blockbusters don't...they have a story.The path and story, the arc if you will, of Logans character far exceeds almost any SF Movie characters development before, during, or sadly to say much of after to this day.Logan's Run is a classic 1970's Sci-Fi Cinema/Drama/Love Story, and well worth the time to watch",Logan's Run

Personally I much more admire THX 1138, and it's 5 years older...I found it also a bit... Weird. I had the feeling it tried to make up for its flaws by adding strange scenes including glowing red lights and low-pitched voices.What really disconcerted me were the hasty transitions between the scenes. And maybe the lack of gradual progression in Logan's state of mind. He goes from ""Runners make me laugh!"" to ""I need to save them all!"" without passing through much apparent thinking. It all goes way too fast I think. Moreover, one point seemed to have been forgotten at the end : ""Did Logan tell Jessica that he had been told to destroy the sanctuary ?""So what I really think is : ...It might be a good book!However, it stars Jenny Agutter, who is not wearing much clothes throughout her ordeal, so I kind of enjoyed it a bit anyway...",Logan's Run
247,hvgreen2000,What IS the computer up to??,8,12 January 2008,"I've just been watching Logan's Run with m'feller and he made a pertinent comment: Does the computer send Logan on the mission to seek and destroy Sanctuary knowing full well that it isn't real? Has the word ""Sanctuary"" and the symbol been planted in the society to promote the myth and encourage ""running""? Is the computer's REAL intention to send someone outside for long enough to ascertain if the conditions outside (post apocalypse) have recovered enough to sustain life. If Logan returns, no matter what the conclusion of his search, then the computer will know its time to let people out. In the film, this is the point when the computer malfunctions. Has it been designed to fail when the outside world becomes habitable? The computer malfunctioning results in the society breaking down and people fleeing outside. Do you think this is the whole essence of the story??",Logan's Run
248,lee-ob,Logan's Run...1976,5,4 November 2005,"The premise: In 2274, after a great catastrophe, society has withdrawn from ""outside"" and enclosed cities in ""bubbles"" run by a central computer. The computer determines what is best for the human citizens, and has also decided that humans cannot live past 29 years of age. When they reach 30, they must go to ""Carousel""...with the hope of being ""renewed."" But not all wish to die at the ripe old age of 29, so a few run...What I Liked: The story had a lot of potential. Good chemistry between Michael York (Logan 5) and Jenny Agutter (Jessica 6). Richard Jordan (Francis 7) steals the scene every time. Peter Ustinov (the old man) added some ""weight"" to the movie.What I Disliked: Poorly written script. Poorly developed characters. Awful special effects that looked dated even only a year after the movie was released (remember Star Wars?).Bottom Line: It's good campy fun. And I can't wait for a remake.",Logan's Run
249,zablaglionisteve,A Futuristic Satisfaction of Visual and Sound,10,19 February 2019,"Must see first timers of clever and witty sci-fi fans. THEME Music is beyond exquisite and, ncidental, action soundtrack is original. Better than Big budget flix. I fell in love with this classic first time I saw it at age 10. Must See It!",Logan's Run
