0,SnoopyStyle,bleak urban gangsterism,7,26 November 2014,Caine Lawson (Tyrin Turner) and best friend O-Dog (Larenz Tate) go into a grocery store. O-Dog takes offense from the Korean storekeeper's comment and shoots him and his wife. Caine's father (Samuel L. Jackson) was a drug dealer and cold-hearted killer. He grew up with his grandparents. Caine and his cousin Harold are carjacked. Harold is murdered. O-Dog and Caine go to kill the carjackers. O-Dog is gleeful about his murderous spree while Caine is much more hesitant. Caine is eventually arrested for the grocery store killings and his life spirals downwards.The Hughes brothers are able to bring a vision of urban gangsterism that is cold-hearted and bleak. Larenz Tate is amazing as the unflinching joyful killer. His glee and pride of killing the Korean couple is the best in the movie. Tyrin Turner is not as compelling as an actor. The movie essentially follows the less interesting character. Caine is portrayed more as a regular guy struggling against his bad upbringing and his surroundings. It would be better to have O-Dog beside him voicing the evil side for the entire movie.,Menace II Society
1,kosmasp,Gritty and nihilistic answer to Boyz,9,11 October 2017,"Back then the Hughes Brothers would never even name Boyz'N'the Hood. Not just because it wasn't their influence, but because people like to compare movies. Especially when it seems like they are similar. And I say seem, because while the surface may suggest that, this is a whole different beast of a movie and a story.This is way more gritty and no one will tell you that it is a feel good story. But the influence of Scarface and other movies of that kind are apparent. Like a Goodfellas tracking shot and many other things. The brothers may have been very young, but they knew what they wanted ... and they were lucky enough to get (most of?) it! Like the cast, but also the overall finance for the movie ... which brings us back to Boyz ... over the years they themselves came to terms, that their movie probably got green-lit because of the success of Boyz ... and that's not a bad thing.And while this is down and dirty, like Scarface it's a warning, a tale of things that can and will go wrong. What goes around, comes around ... there's a lot to read into this, but the Hughes Brothers wanted show how things were ... and the influence of the movie was felt. Especially with other movies trying to copy or at least pay homage to Menace ...",Menace II Society
2,gavin6942,The Essential Gang Film?,7,6 June 2016,"A young street hustler attempts to escape the rigors and temptations of the ghetto in a quest for a better life.While widely praised, others have said this film suffers because it is ""cliche"". And, you know, I would not disagree with that. Despite not having seen it before, I felt as if I knew every twist and turn by heart. But I don't see this as a negative necessarily, because it makes it sort of the essential Los Angeles gang film -- if you only ever see one, this is probably it.There is a strange thing about the film, though, and that is we are put in the position to see some of the kids as the protagonists and others as antagonists. But there are few good guys here. Robbery and murder are choices, as is getting your girlfriend pregnant. Why are we supposed to feel this can be so easily forgiven?",Menace II Society
3,Quinoa1984,about as hard hitting an urban coming-of-age/crime drama one could expect,9,6 March 2008,"The Hughes brothers's breakthrough debut, Menace II Society, has the grit to plunge at times into melodrama, but it also is very wise to ride back into a sense of realism that has the residue of Mean Streets, both in attitude, humor, and a perpetual darkness for these characters in their situation. It basically details the experiences of high school graduate Caine (a very under-appreciated Tyrin Turner), including a liquor store robbery-cum-shooting, ill-fated romance, and bad times that seem to be generally lying ahead with either crime or going out of the LA ghetto for good. While many of the themes in the film were previously seen in Boyz N tha Hood, Menace II Society- at least to my memory of both films (I haven't seen either very recently, 'Menace' more recently than the former)- the Hughes's have a more natural, rough-hewed combination of the hard-knocks messages to the piece with the portrayal of the characters and various situations.The film might not be perfect- I remember the ending not striking as well as it could've- but there are so many memorable images, scenes, performances. The opening, to start, as Samuel L. Jackson cuts a permanent impression on his young son watching a murder at a card game (striking use of slow-motion towards the very end as well). Then there's that ""cheeseburger"" man, who later was parodied (probably to not as great effect as originally shown) in Don't Be a Menace to South Central..., as well as Lorenz Tate's 'O-Dog', who is a near classic best-friend character, with all the energy and persuasion and subliminal fatalism that comes with the territory with these guys. It's also an impressive feat to see how shocking the violence can be in the film, even in short (or more-so dramatic) bursts. Despite it being their first film, and having made it in their early 20s, they've already made a film as accomplished and mature as someone might twice their age, albeit youth as the reason it clicks so well.Very cool soundtrack, dynamic performances, and even some melodrama that doesn't turn much icky when nearing the conventional, this is one of the better movies of 1993.",Menace II Society
4,tavm,The Hughes Brothers' Menace II Society can be upsetting but still also worthwhile if you stick around to the end,8,25 February 2012,"Okay, after 20 years of reading and hearing about this movie by The Hughes (Albert and Allen) Brothers, I finally watched Meanace II Society on YouTube. Mainly about teen hood Caine (Tyrin Turner) and his life with fellow South Central L.A. pal O-Dog (Larenz Tate), among other events of that time, I found the whole thing a little upsetting with what I've now found out had the most use of the f-word of any of these black movies I've been watching these last few days, not to mention the constant violence. Still, it does get better when Caine's possible girlfriend Ronnie (Jada Pinkett before becoming Mrs. Will Smith) offers a possible out by moving out with her and her son Anthony (Jullian Roy Doster) to Atlanta. But then another girl he fooled around with named Ilena (Erin Leshawn Wiley) tells him she's pregnant and...oh, watch the film if you want to know. In summary, Menace II Society didn't really pick my interest until the last 30 minutes and I started to see it in a whole new light. So on that note, I highly recommend it with reservations.",Menace II Society
5,edwagreen,This Menace to Society is Real but Cliché Ridden **1/2,5,11 September 2008,"The film is a very good one but is filled with clichés. We are dealing with extremely violent people, many of whom regard life with a depraved indifference.If ever there were an argument related to genetics vs. environment to determine how we act, the latter would win overwhelmingly after seeing such a brutal film.With its brutality and realization, the film is so clichéd. We see the fact of drug-addicted, crime prone parents off to an early grave, the caring religious grandparents who can't control their wayward grandson, the out-of control hooligans terrorizing innocent, hard working people, schools that don't care and merely pass on the troublemakers, and white police officers as racist as they come.What are the solutions to all this violence? Is there any hope left for society? Must we all go into hiding?This is an utterly frightening story portraying the lives of young hoodlums who care so little about life.I was tempted to laugh when I saw the scene where the grandparents are watching ""It's A Wonderful Life."" The latter film is so out of the realm of what is going on in today's communities.You have magnificent acting performances here that go by the waste side due to the constant violence and use of profanity.",Menace II Society
6,searchanddestroy-1,The modern blaxploitation at its very very best.,10,20 November 2020,"The Hughes Bros, as Spike Lee; Ernie Dickerson or John Singleton, are the continuity of the seventies blaxploitation, but more powerful, tragic and especially social, than its kid sister from two decades earlier, more fun oriented and exploitation stuff involving Black community ; not always without clichés: drug dealers, pimps and so on. But this old era was mainly a kind of fashion experiment, mainly for fun, the social involvement was underneath, not on the front line. This little masterpiece will remain one of the best efforts from the Hughes, with DEAD PRESIDENTS. That doesn't mean that their movie about Jack the Ripper and released in 2002 is lousy, hell no, but they tried to get out their usual stuff and that was a good try. So, back to MENACE 2, it is under influence of Marty Scorcese too. Even a blind or dumb dude would agree. Acting, editing, directing, everything is over the top, awesome.",Menace II Society
7,hitchcockthelegend,"I thought killing those fools would make me feel good, but it really didn't make me feel anything.",8,5 September 2009,"The directorial debut of twin brothers Albert and Allen Hughes, Menace II Society is a tough, no nonsense look at youthful black life in the Watts section of Los Angeles. The Hughes Brother's movie charts the hapless life of Caine (Tyrin Turner) as he seeks to escape the ghetto. The son of both a drug dealer (Samuel L. Jackson in a potent appearance) and an addict, Tyrin, surrounded by guns and a machismo culture, is tied to his friends and the way of life afforded him. Even as love and a chance of a way out arises with Jada Pinkett's (terrific) pretty Ronnie, it's doubtful if Tyrin will escape from the revolving door of death.Menace II Society had a troubled beginning, refused a video certificate on the grounds of its profane language and brutally violent scenes, it has since gone on to be viewed as one of the finer exponents of anti-violence involving Black Americans. That wasn't always the case though, many critics in the 90s were prone to calling it a film that glamorises the lifestyle of ""Hood"" gangsters, but offered a saver of sorts by correctly saying it had realism in amongst the harshness. Certainly the dialogue and regional slang was refreshing to hear, thus affording ""Menace"" and its makers praise for keeping it real, so to speak.Ineviatbly comparisons were (are) drawn with John Singleton's 1991 film, Boyz n the Hood. But although ""Menace"" is rawer, uncompromising and more visceral with impact, it lacks the intelligence of Singleton's film. Where ""Boyz"" had fully rounded characters, character with which to hang your hat on to, ""Menace"" is just a social group of youths we neither know or care about outside of the group, ego driven dynamic. When lead protagonist Tyrin is trying to deal with his inner conflict, we the audience are treated to standard run of the mill melodrama. The streetwise edginess that the Hughes' began their film with (the opening is nigh on horrific) has long since gone as they try to make a film that touches all the bases of Black Americana.Easily the most realistic of all the ghetto films made, in fact the film at times feels like we are on a documentary drive around downtown Watts. Menace II Society, however brutal it clearly is, has loaded the gun and shot the bullet, only to see it narrowly miss the whole target it was aiming for. Still it's one hell of an experience though. 8/10",Menace II Society
8,preppy-3,Well-done but familiar,7,5 May 2004,"Caine (Tyrin Turner) and best friend ""O-Dog"" (Larenz Tate) grow up in Watts section of California--over run by drugs and violence. Caine is in love with Ronnie (Jada Pinkett) who wants to get out of there with her young son. She wants him to come with her...but can he break away from the drugs and violence he grew up with?This is very graphic and well-done...but I've seen it all before. Doesn't anyone remember ""Boyz N the Hood"" which came out in 1991? It told virtually the same tale and had a similar setting. That aside this is still a powerful movie. The language is raw (there is virtual non-stop swearing) and the violence is very bloody, disturbing and right in your face. The movie sometimes hammers it's message too strong (this film is anything but subtle), but it was made by two brothers (Allen and Albert Hughes) when they were only 21 so that can be overlooked. There are also great performances by Turner, Tate and especially Pinkett. Actually, the entire cast is great.So, I liked it but nothing about it shocked me or told me anything I didn't know. I give it an 8.",Menace II Society
9,zetes,Brutal and powerful,9,17 March 2013,"I have seen the other really famous movie about gangs in South Central L.A., Boyz n the Hood, a few times before, but I had never given this one a chance. One reason is that I always found Boyz a tad corny. Menace II Society has a few corny moments, too, but, in general, it's a lot better than Boyz. The film follows Tyrin Turner as a young man who is being drawn further and further into gang life, especially by his best friend Larenz Tate, a true psychopath who thinks nothing of murder. Jada Pinkett (before she married Will Smith) plays a responsible woman who tries to save Turner by taking him to Atlanta with her to start a new life. The violence in this picture is truly shocking - just absolutely nasty and brutal. I was surprised by just how powerful this one was. Tate and Pinkett are the stand-outs in the cast. Samuel L. Jackson has a small role, as does Charles S. Dutton.",Menace II Society
10,StevePulaski,Articulates being a menace to yourself in addition,9,8 February 2016,"Menace II Society shows growing up in an impoverished urban area plagued by violence by detailing numerous different perspectives; compassion, aggression, resistance, compliance, brute force, contentment, and more. Various scenes in the film, which is largely a string of vignette-style events strung together rather than a fully formed plot, focus on characters discussing their motivations to either combat or work around the violence in their area, with some choosing to try and fight it by contributing to it, and others simply trying to function in a community that is more like a warzone.The Hughes Brothers, Albert and Allen, who directed and co-wrote the film with Tyger Williams, craft their film around two young black teens growing up in South Central Los Angeles. One is Kaydee ""Caine"" Lawson (Tyrin Turner), who's father was a drug dealer killed when he was only ten, while his mother was a heroin addict who died shortly after. He went on to live with his grandparents, though their strict, moralist attitudes rooted in religion didn't stop Caine from becoming a petty drug dealer like his father. The other young man is Kevin ""O-Dog"" Anderson, who shows his best friend Caine what he can really do when the two go to a Korean-owned cornerstore to buy malt liquor and the owners watch them suspiciously and nervously walk around the store. After the cashier makes a derogatory comment, O-Dog loses his cool and winds up shooting both the cashier and his wife before robbing the cash register and taking the surveillance tape. Just another day in South Central, it seems.The film winds up showing the day-to-day life of Caine and O-Dog, which involves Caine nearly dying after being shot in a carjacking, as well as petty crime involving cracking cars for insurance money. We also get a glimpse in the life of Ronnie (Jada Pinkett), a single-mother with a young son she is desperately trying to shelter from the bleak environment and unrelenting violence that engulfs the neighborhood. Her character's introduction begins the Hughes brothers' descent into examining different perspectives of the neighborhood.Consider the scene where Caine is playing with Ronnie's young son, who is clearly growing up fast for a five-year-old, as he loves to be able to hold Caine's pistol, drink liquor, and hang out with the crowd of older boys. Ronnie is disgusted by Caine's compliance with allowing her son to hold a pistol and hang with his friends as they sip some of their ostensibly endless supply of malt liquor and smoke marijuana. Caine claims that this is for the young boy's good, as this is a rough and rugged neighborhood that laughs at kids who are kept from witnessing the violence in such a miserable landscape. The Hughes brothers allow you, as a member of the audience, to judge for yourself on both perspectives and hear each of their characters out; it is because of this even-handed approach that we see that Caine's point, while holding weight, also shows the cyclical pattern of young black men getting incarcerated or killed at a young age due to violent crime or the solicitation of drugs, and we understand Ronnie's protectiveness as a parent, but wonder if that approach is also just buying time for another funeral.The Hughes Brothers take a very liberal approach to Menace II Society in terms of crafting its characters. Unlike John Singleton's directorial debut Boyz N The Hood, a film that illustrates how and why you should care about its characters and why they are all smart men stuck in a hopeless situation, Menace II Society never gives you a reason to like Caine and O-Dog. By the conventionality of Hollywood cinema, we, the audience, should detest Caine and O-Dog for their criminal ways and their unconscionable resort to violence and immediate gratification whenever they get the chance. The Hughes Brothers likely feel the same way, but they challenge us to find reasons for us to care about them throughout the course of the film, and see if we can find even some sympathy for their situations.For much of the film, I didn't feel too sympathetic, until the third act, which takes a strikingly raw turn. Granted much of the film is captured with a gritty sense of realism, one doesn't really see the ugliness unfold until the third act, when karmic revenge circumvents and finds its lead characters unprepared to lie in the bed they've made for themselves. Menace II Society's only lacking feature is the Hughes brothers' directorial choices; the camera never seems to stay still, and either finds itself oscillating around the main characters in a 360 degree fashion or loosely tracks its location in a way that sort of oddly details spatial relations between characters and their surroundings when there's really no need to do so.With all that being said, Menace II Society winds up using its narrative and directorial grittiness in a manner that's germane to its illustration of various character perspectives in how to deal with growing up in a tumultuous neighborhood. The end result bears all the pain, immediate gratification, and whirlwind of emotions you'd expect and winds up being one of the strongest dramas I've yet to see that details the hood in a painfully realistic light. Finally, it works to emphasize that while your drug-dealing and violent crime is indeed a menace to society, it's also makes, perhaps equally significant, a menace to yourself.",Menace II Society
11,Smells_Like_Cheese,The hard cold truth about the ghetto,8,16 July 2007,"I wasn't so sure about seeing Menace II Society, see, my problem is that I think that the kids who dress and act like ""gangstas"" always complain about how they are treated and how they are always going to be treated when it seems like they don't even try to improve themselves. Menace II Society gave me a different look to that thought and how scary it must be to be there, to survive making it to 18 years old is just a huge accomplishment. Still, it frightens me how much we haven't changed, how these kids still kill each other like there's a war on. It breaks my heart that if one feels insulted they just go in a car and shoot somebody like a coward and runs off.Caine has had a very rough life, he grew up in the ghetto with his drug addicted parents and when his father and mother dies, he lives with his grandparents. But that doesn't stop him from leading a life of stealing, sex, drugs, and murder. In a life where some are proud of the way they act and kill, he's the minority when he thinks there is more to life than this. But he joins in feeling there is no other way out until his friend invites him to get out with her and her son, but it may be too late to turn back now after all he did.Menace II Society is a great film with very thought provoking messages. When the grandfather said to Caine if he cared if he lived or died, it just broke my heart to think what the grandparents were going through knowing their grandson could die before they did. I think this is a very important film, it doesn't go over the top and it doesn't rub the gangsta life in your face, it just gives you a certain view of how scary it is to think there may be no way back.8/10",Menace II Society
12,OllieSuave-007,Trying to escape a day in the life in the ghetto.,4,30 June 2014,"This is a gritty drama depicting violence living in the LA ghetto where we see street hustler Caine attempting to escape the life in the ghetto in order to lead a better self. This movie details untold gun violence, severe beatings, homicide and bloody images as gang members and street thugs are pitted against each other - all surrounding Caine's struggling attempt to escape it all. This depicts the unfortunate reality that these gang members never resist the street life and change for the better, forever becoming victims in the cycle of violence and, sadly, negatively influencing young children to be part of this life style. The acting and course of events are fierce and the movie's momentum keeps everything tense. Some viewers would find this movie riveting but probably would also find it upsetting at the same time as these actors are depicting the reality of a day in the life in the ghetto, which I find extremely appalling. In addition, most of the actors portrayed morally deprived thugs with not even an ounce of humanity in them. If the director had the foresight to insert at least a little moral value or redeeming qualities in the characters, the movie would have been more tolerable and you would probably learn something positive from the film, rather than watching a film that glorifies violence.Grade D-",Menace II Society
13,eddie_baggins,A raw look at life in the hood,6,12 May 2020,"Announcing the arrival of directing duo and siblings Albert and Allen Hughes, Menace II Society may feel like a product of its time watched in today's day and age but its confronting look at life in the mean streets of the Los Angeles hoods is still an insightful and noteworthy expose.Filled with more than a few movies worth of expletives, over the top and bloodthirsty violence and some acting scenes (particularly death scenes) that don't quite stand up to modern expectations, Menace is a rough and raw product from the Hughes brothers but one filled with some genuine heart and a clear goal to deliver an unsavoury look at the sometimes oddly glorified gang life.Telling the story of Tyrin Turner's Caine, who seems to have a decent brain at his disposal and the care of his grandparents who want him to make something of his life outside of street hustling and drug taking, Menace sees Caine caught in a seemingly unstoppable cycle of bad decisions and life events as his friendship with the loose cannon O-Dog (played by a hamming it up Larenz Tate) leads him down a path destined for failure.There's nothing overly original about Menace's plot of set-up and a few instances throughout the film feel slightly over-played or Hollywoodized but there's enough authenticity and soul to the Hughes film that it ensures Menace can overcome these issues to be a socially relevant and necessary look at life in the shady suburbs of one of the worlds most famed cities.Not as dramatically rich or character strong as heavy hitting classic Boys in the Hood or as well structured as Get Rich or Die Tryin or Straight Outta Compton, Menace feels like the type of small-scale effort that is restricted by a limited budget and tools at its disposal but the way it captures the time and place of Caine and O-Dog's environment is commendable, as the two friends but different souls navigate their coming of age in a landscape that promotes violence as a way of life.Not easy going viewing and not a film for light entertainment, this is in your face filmmaking with little to no nuances, which fits the bill for its subject matter in a matter of fact and necessary way.Final Say -Not aging as finely as some of its other 90's counterparts, Menace II Society is still a unique and insightful look into the gang culture that many in the United States have refused to properly acknowledge for far too long.3 Drive-Thru robberies out of 5",Menace II Society
14,howard.schumann,A film of raw power,9,29 March 2004,"On Friday, August 13th, 1965, the area known as Watts in south central Los Angeles erupted from a routine arrest of a drunk driver and escalated into a riot that lasted for six days and killed 34 people, almost all black. The Watts Riots showed Americans the depressed conditions of the area and led to the initial discussion of a redevelopment effort within the community. Almost 40 years later, little has changed. Unemployment rates are about twice the national average and the underlying issues of social dysfunction remain, seemingly immune to LAPD policing, the War on Drugs, or Habitat for Humanity housing programs. The despair of the inner city ghetto has never been more graphically and realistically presented than in the Hughes Brothers' Menace II Society, a film of raw power film shot in Compton, California one year after the Rodney King incident that triggered the riots of 1992. The film is more of a collection of brutal images than a coherent narrative, an explosive and disturbing picture of a community mired in nihilism and the hopelessness that follows. Containing standout performances from young actors Tyrin Turner, Larenz Tate, and Jada Pinkett, the film's violence is graphic and realistic, avoiding (with some exception) the special effects and highly stylized violence we have come to expect from the genre. Caine (Turner), who narrates the film, is a product of the mean streets and has witnessed violence his whole life. His father, a dope dealer, and his mother, a heroin addict are both dead and Pernell (Glenn Plummer), the man who he turned to for guidance, is in prison. He is forced to live with his religious grandparents and his only adult companion is Pernell's girl Ronnie (Pinkett) and her five-year old son. By the time he is in high school he is already dealing drugs and carrying a weapon. His best friend is a borderline psychotic named O-Dog (Tate), the epitome of inner city youth who have no stake in society, kill without conscience, and whose self-respect is only as strong as the weapon they carry.In the film's opening, a Korean grocer becomes the first target of the pent-up frustration of Caine and O-Dog who kill them in a random, purposeless act after the grocer says that he pities their mother and asks the boys to leave the store. The videotape, retrieved by the killers during their escape, is sickeningly replayed throughout the film by O-Dog as entertainment at parties. The scene underscores the racism directed at Asian storekeepers, also depicted in Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing, and brings to mind the general problem of white storeowners who act as middlemen for corporations unwilling to set up franchises in the inner city. When a new Denny's restaurant opened recently, it was the first restaurant opened in Watts in thirty years.Caine is bright and looking for a way out and we feel sympathy for him without supporting his violent actions and his unwillingness to take responsibility for his life. He is tempted by offers to escape, one with a friend who has become a Muslim and is leaving for Kansas, the other with Ronnie who is moving to Atlanta, but the only world that he is comfortable with consists of drugs, guns, and early death. We want him to get out before it's too late, but we know too well that it is hard to breakthrough the context of his life -- that is no hope and no way out. When he gets a neighborhood girl pregnant and refuses to help, the girl's cousin comes looking for him, leading to a climactic confrontation that leaves us desperate for answers yet unable to see any. Despite its cutesy title, Menace II Society is one powerful mother of a film.",Menace II Society

16,videorama-759-859391,"A electrically charged drama, Boyn N Hood on speed",9,30 March 2014,"This is a more intensified version of Boyz n' hood, and more the better. Opening with a shocking double murder in a Korean convenience store, committed by a pair of black teens, the star performers of the show, this flick doesn't hold back on the out of control exploits and wayward youth of South Bronz, or more so the community known as Watts. We live in the shoes of Caine, one the youths from the convenience store, while his bad arse mate, Kevin, played by Larenz Tate, with raw intensity in this electrifying flick, was the murderous hand, on the account of the Korean clerk, making an insult regarding the teen folks. He really judges the two the moment they walk into the shop. When stealing the store camera/videotape, they watched it repeatedly where Kevin makes a sick comment about selling these babies for $9.95 There are some powerfully violent moments, eye for an eye kind of stuff, especially in it's fatal end, it's catalyst that has Caine sticking his wick into one too many girls. The bit where Caine got shot bad, and taken into the hospital where he's bleeding bad was quite tense. Despite influences from family and teachers, to choose the right path, it's wasted on Kevin, his fate truly something scary, where Kane could change his tune, which this is the want of the viewer. The fine Samuel L Jackson who briefly appears in flashback scenes was memorable, imprinted in my mind, when blowing away another guy at home at a card game, while getting friendly with his misses. Caine almost mirrors that scene later, giving a guy one hell of a pounding, for cracking onto girlfriend (Jada Pinkett) in a very strong performance I must say. The whole movie is very well made, and goes further than Boy's N Hood, with true moments of choking intensity and moments of heavy shock violence, especially Caine's shot scene towards the early part of the film. But too it's very potent. All of these things are what betters it.",Menace II Society

18,dee.reid,Meaning in the violence,10,27 January 2003,"""Boyz N the Hood"" was a landmark film and certainly is one of the best movies of the 1990s. This is true but it was too preachy in the execution of its main themes.  Director John Singleton has never matched it (and probably never will) but has come close with such hard-hitting films as ""Higher Learning"", ""Rosewood"", ""Shaft"" and ""Baby Boy"".  Don't get me wrong, I love ""Boyz"" and I know that Singleton is one of the finest African-American directors in Hollywood, it is just that I cannot get past the tiring preachiness that has become common in his films.Now, you do not see that with the Hughes Brothers.  They portray their films in a much more realistic fashion.  One thing that has become a main criticism with the Hughes Brothers, is how they portray violence in their films.  How else can you show violence in a movie without it looking completely fake?  Just look at anything they've done and you notice how frighteningly realistic their subject matter is.  Yes in this film, people are shot, beaten, and robbed, but it is done a brutal fashion that is realistic.  If you've seen any music video or film that they have directed, you can easily make the claim that they are the best at what they do - portraying life as for what it is.  First look at ""Menace II Society"".  This film upon its release in 1993, was instantly compared to ""Boyz N the Hood"".  What separated the two, was their subject matter.  ""Boyz"" focused on the positive side of living in the Los Angeles ghetto, which was South Central if I'm not mistaking.  It also showed us Tre (played by Cuba Gooding, Jr.) who tries to survive, despite his harsh surroundings.  He grows up with a caring father (Laurence Fishburne) and it also shows him with his friends, many of whom are doomed to the legacy of street violence.  ""Menace"" shows us the other, darker side of that picture.  The story focuses on Caine (brilliantly played by Tyrin Turner) and his life after graduating from high school.  It goes without saying that Caine is a criminal, but we come to sympathize with him, even though there is no way we can support his actions.  He's a product of drug-pushing/using parents, witnessed murder before he was ten, was orphaned sometime later, and is now living with his God-fearing grandparents. Throughout the film, Caine and O-Dog (Larenz Tate) commit numerous crimes. You may think that the Hughes Brothers are glorifying that criminal image, but in fact, they are condemning it.  If they were glorifying Caine and O-Dog's actions, then the Brothers would not show us the consequences of those actions.      Now look at their music videos.  I cannot describe any 2Pac videos because I haven't seen any, but I can describe the Korn videos, both ""Here To Stay"" and ""Thoughtless"".  Now before I go into this, I'll say that I'm a huge fan of rap, but I also enjoy some metal, Korn being the biggest thing metal I listen to.  At first I wondered why the Hughes Brothers would direct music videos for a band like Korn, and then I listened to songs on their newest CD, titled ""Untouchables"".  Right there on the first track I realized the connection between Korn and the Hughes Brothers - the Brothers trademark of naturalness of everyday life combined with Jonathan Davis' angst-filled and sometimes violent lyrics, which often describe his childhood in school.  In Korn's ""Here To Stay"" video, we are shown the band (Davis, Brian Welch, James Shaffer, Reginald Arvizu and David Silveria), silhouetted against a huge snowing television screen.  Throughout the video, images of the band are intercut with footage of the Gulf War, C-sections being performed, the L.A. riots, the 1986 Challenger explosion, police chases, animals attacking other animals, and at one point during the video, we are shown a police a car with the numbers ""666"" on the roof.  As a grand finale, we are shown a twelve year-old boy sucked into the television screen after coming into contact with it.  The relevance here is not the band itself, but the Hughes Brothers direction.  The end shows how images of violence and destruction in the news affect our youth, just like in ""Menace II Society"" with Caine, who was young and was exposed to the same conditions as the boy in the video.In Korn's ""Thoughtless"" video, we're shown a seventeen year-old boy who gets revenge on his classmates by showing up at prom with a hooker for a date and ends with him vomiting all over his classmates, while his hooker girlfriend is laughing the entire time.  Again, the Brothers are showing us violence in youth, but doesn't show us the consequences of the boy's actions.  He wanted revenge, he got it, but is he truly satisfied?  The connection with the Brothers here is like in ""Menace"", showing that there is always consequences and you most likely will suffer.  In the case of the boy, he will most likely end up warped and needing psychiatric help. The Hughes Brothers have come under heavy scrutiny for just about everything they've ever worked on.  This is largely because as I've already stated that their work is often very grim, but people often miss the fact that their work is often very optimistic about everything they talk about.  Caine could have moved to Atlanta, the boy in the ""Here To Stay"" video could have simply turned off the television, and the boy in ""Thoughtless"" could have put everything behind him and start over.As an African-American person myself from Virginia and living in a middle-class neighborhood no where near any of the areas I've described, I can't say for sure how accurate these films are (nor the music videos), but I can say that the Hughes Brothers, John Singleton and Korn truly bring out a glimpse of what life can be for some people.",Menace II Society
19,drqshadow-reviews,"An Earnest, Deep Dive into the Origins (and Repercussions) of Inner-City Violence",8,20 July 2020,"There's no such thing as an easy out, or an honest answer, for the children of LA's low-income housing projects. Particularly so in the early 90s, while the embers of the city's race riots still simmered and gang violence reached new levels with every passing day.Menace doesn't flinch from any of that, depicting a tight-knit crew of conflicted teenagers that's neither heroic nor villainous. These are just kids, albeit kids with access to guns and ski masks, trying to sort out their place in society before the city rips them to pieces. They make bad decisions, as teens are wont to do, but also get caught in the crossfire of forces well beyond their control. Their daily lives are a whirling vortex of drugs, hormones, social influence and class warfare. No wonder they're so confused and cavalier, quick to resort to spontaneous violence. They're frustrated and overlooked, with a lack of guidance and compassion in their lives. Everybody's out to take what's theirs, so they either play the same game or go home empty handed. We can show compassion over the circumstances that produced them without celebrating the casualties of their noisy, adolescent snarls.That message rings loud and true throughout the film's all-too-brief ninety-odd minutes. It's a boldly honest moment in time, a document of the sources behind such complicated injustice. Some of the acting performances might be wooden and recited, the independent-level production values occasionally transparent, but the raw emotion and brutal honesty is fair compensation. This one's gonna make you think.",Menace II Society
20,lukem-52760,EXTREMELY POWERFUL & RAW MASTERPIECE,9,29 April 2019,"Menace to society was a terrifying movie to me growing up in the 90's even though i didn't grow up in a hood like these guys it showed a level of raw needless,unnecessary violence that goes on these ghettos & just like the brilliant Boys n the hood this affected anyone who watched it.
Menace is a Classic from the one of the greatest era's of filmmaking the 1990's, back then it was a time of straight out & Stone cold, instant Classic's with films such as Tarantino's Blood Soaked Debut RESERVOIR DOGS then PULP FICTION & the big impact Hood Drama BOYS N THE HOOD & Big Game Changing Blockbusters such as JURASSIC PARK, INDEPENDENCE DAY & MEN IN BLACK, the 90's was my era growing up & Cinema was the greatest in my opinion. Menace definitely is one of the best & most important films to drop in the 90's & it's raw & savage approach to the scary reality of Urban Life in Los Angeles hasn't been captured better or as shocking. The Hughes bro's crafted a small Masterpiece & gave us an outstanding performance from Leranz Tate who played the scarily no-conscience & unpredictable killer O'dog, I'm so surprised he didn't become a much bigger star after this role? At least he was cast again by the Hughes bro's for their next film DEAD PRESIDENTS, another brilliant movie & also stood out along side action star Vin Diesel in the action Thriller A MAN APART.
Also of course Tyrin Turner is excellent as the main lead Caine & has cemented his role as one of the most memorable & iconic of probably all the Urban Hood Drama films!!! Also Menace is a great caution tale about doing all that bad stuff they do will always come back to you at some point, so don't do it but it also shows abit of why these kids in the bad neighbourhoods live that type of life, it's hard out there & they're encouraged by all they see. It's a difficult look at their lives because on one hand they're scum for what they do totally & on the other hand it's sad that this is all they know!!!
This is an incredibly powerful crime drama & my older bro used to watch it over & over on video so i saw it alot & it was always such a raw emotional watch.
The performances are outstanding so real & raw it's like watching a documentary of real hood life in a los Angeles ghetto. You can feel the sticky summer heat in the excellent cinematography & the brutal violence that bursts onto screen there's an atmosphere of dread like you would get in a Horror movie that hangs over our two main characters Cain & O'dog who are living in this hell called a hood & trying to survive the brutality of it all & work out what is right & what's not, it's nightmare they're stuck in.A very raw powerful look into the ghettos of these American cities & how the gangs operate & how it's a fight for survival & taking a life means absolutely nothing.
An outstanding movie with powerful performances.
A true Masterpiece from the 1990's & a terrifying look at life in Los Angeles ghettos that truly packs an extremely powerful & emotional punch & one you will never forget!!!
A true Cult Classic or Masterpiece? which ever it is it's a BRILLIANT movie that still shocks & has such memorable characters & some dark humour & one of the most memorable & shocking opening scenes in all of Cinema history-The Korean shop scene!!!",Menace II Society
21,Agent10,An amazing debut for the Hughes brothers,8,22 May 2002,"The Hughes brothers made quite a splash with this film, making one of  the best inner city films since Boys in the Hood. While I didn't care  much for the voice overs, the ending to the film proved to be bone  chilling, especially after becoming so close to the characters who were killed. I felt Larenz Tate did an excellent job in his role as  O-Dog. While too many people focused on the violence in the movie, it  really wasn't the focal point. It was really more about how the  characters were conditioned, how they became used to the concept to  random violence. A solid film with some great performances.",Menace II Society
22,rbverhoef,Very powerful,9,20 June 2003,"'Menace II Society' is about growing up in the violent inner city. The movie starts with two guys, Caine (Tyrin Turner) and O-Dog (Larenz Tate), going into a Korean supermarket to get beer. The owner says he doesn't want any trouble but also says he feels sorry for the mother of the boy O-Dog. For O-Dog this is enough to kill the guy. From the Korean guy's wife he wants the videotape from the security camera and then he kills her too. Caine doesn't approve this behavior because it was over nothing. Later in the movie we see Caine can kill as well, for bigger issues. The story is narrated by Caine, a guy who probably was a better man if he grew up somewhere else. But he didn't grew up somewhere else. He has always seen violence. When he was about five his father (Samuel L. Jackson) shoot a guy in front of his eyes for the first time. His mother dies of an overdose. Now Caine is living with his grandparents who do love him. There are some other people who really care for him. One of them is Mr. Butler (Charles S. Dutton), a school teacher, another one is Ronnie (Jada Pinkett). She was the girlfriend of his mentor who is now in jail.This is a very violent but powerful movie. It shows how it works in the ghetto. I don't know if it is like this but after seeing this movie I believe so. The performances are very strong. Tyrin Turner, Jada Pinkett and especially Larenz Tate give terrific performances. May be the movie is not for everyone because of the violence, but if you want to show the truth, you have to show the truth.",Menace II Society
23,valleyjohn,No Sympathy i'm afraid.,7,24 April 2021,"This the story of a a young man from the hood who attempts to escape the rigors and temptations of the ghetto in a quest for a better life but you just know that things aren't going to go well...I enjoyed this but there is a hell of a lot wrong with it .Firstly , the dialogue is really baggy . I'm not sure if it's the actual words or the way they are performed.At no stage was I on the side of any of the characters because they just weren't likeable .They treated people like dirt , they speak to each other badly and violence is an everyday thing , so when they are in jeopardy, I just wanted them to get what they deserved .There are much better films on the same subject that were released in the late eighties and early nineties but at no stage was I ever bored , because these are people who live life on the edge and it' almost like watching a car crash about to happen .Lorenz Tate is the best thing about this film . The only time I've seen him in anything after this , is the Netflix TV series Power and I'm surprised he's not had a bigger career based on this impressive performance.",Menace II Society
24,Movie-ManDan,An Intense Hood Film.,10,1 January 2017,"Boyz N the Hood is the quintessential hood film. But Menace II Society is the more violent version of it. Menace II Society deals with less fortunate characters that in Boyz N the Hood. Luckily, they are just as fleshed out.The movie opens up with protagonist and narrator Caine (Tyrin Turner) loitering with his best friend O-Dog (Larenz Tate) and about to buy booze in a convenience store. One thing leads to another and O-Dog brutally kills the owners. The scene is played out perfectly as we feels the shots fired. O-Dog is the most sadistic and violent guy in the hood. Like Joe Pesci in Goodfellas or 2Pac in Juice, there is no beating the psycho known as O-Dog. He is proud of the kill and he flaunts the surveillance tape to their friends. Tate does an awesome job.Caine's mother was a junkie and his father was a drug dealer. He witnessed his mother OD and his father get brutally killed when he was a child. He then goes onto live with his religious and overly- calm grandparents. He witnesses so many violent activities in the streets and partakes in half of them. Throughout the film, we see Caine progress into a more ambitious and less crazy character. He doesn't think too much of cheating on his girlfriend (Jada Picket-Smith) or sticking with his friends if a rival gets in their face. But he feels shock when O-Dog kills the clerk and the he is questioned about a carjacking. It is not easy for him to escape what has consumed himself his whole life.This is an extremely brutal but powerful film. Not everybody has a well-meaning father like Fishburne in Boyz N the Hood. The brutality featured in this helps propel the power that this has. The characters are real and this does an amazing job of showing one's consequences. Caine eventually grows to try to live a better life outside the hood. We sit there wondering if he can.I recommend watching this and Boyz N the Hood. Doesn't matter the order or even if its in the same day. Both show perfectly the effects of living in a ghetto and different home lives.4/4",Menace II Society
25,p-stepien,Too fragmented,5,28 September 2012,"A brutal and thoroughly realistic of life in the afroamerican dominated Watts district in Los Angeles. Depicting the life of one adolescent criminal Caine (Tyrin Turner) with little restraint or hints of glossing over the morality, ""Menace II Society"" is a harrowing piece and fascinating debut by the Hughes Brothers. Fragmented and chaotic in storytelling, much like the unplanned, unfocused everyday life the plot moves from event to event in a seemingly unconnected fashion, with only Caine being the stalwart throughout. Other characters appear briefly throughout like Caine's drug dealing father (Samuel L. Jackson), his unscrupulous friend O-Dog (Larenz Tate) or Islam convert Tony (Anthony Johnson) fill in point of views, context and give a wider outlook at life in Watts. Events are left touched, but unfinished, as if small captions of reality captured on screen. The key character of the movie is Caine himself, who is equally endearing as he is menacing, dangerous and morally corrupt, an amalgamate of good and evil, leaving viewers unable to fully define the person along such close-minded perceptions.This method of storytelling does make it touch watching, lacking suspense or story-build, failing to connect with the audience. Nonetheless by the final act, when all events seamlessly summarise the life of Caine we receive a really poignant conclusion. The overall impact has somewhat waned through time and the filmmaking deficiencies in cinematography, sound or basic storytelling take away from what is an otherwise gratifying experience.",Menace II Society
26,eric262003,Perfect in All Its Details and Its Realism,10,6 June 2021,"With a lot of film that often self-describe themselves as ""hood"" films, there's not one that compares with this classic from 1993. ""Menace II Society"" is the perfect example of the hardships and tribulations that manifests within the parameters of ghetto life which includes street gangs, criminal activity, drugs and alcohol, street hookers, impoverished neighbourhoods, systemic racism and social injustices with the police. The refreshing thing that makes ""Menace II Society"" stand out is that it's not directed by some veteran in the field, but by two twenty-year-old siblings Albert and Allen Hughes, who made the film so natural, they are right up there with legends like Spielberg, Scorsese and Tarantino and that's not just me being hyperbolic. Unless you have virgin ears or you are sensitive towards gratuitous violence, then please turn away now or else you have been warned.The opening scenes never hold back is horrifying demeanour as two young men named Caine (Tyrin Turner) and O-Dog (Larenz Tate) walk into a convenience store to purchase some liquor only to end up drinking the booze before paying for it. The owners who were Korean are not very comfortable by the presence of these two boys and the male owner says a slightly snide remark towards them. O-Dog, a trigger-happy unapologetically short-tempered thug, kills the owners before making a run for it. While O-Dog seems to take the pleasure with what he accomplished, Caine was not really sure if that was a great idea.Pretty much ""Menace II Society"" chronicles the events and everyday life on the broken streets of Los Angeles' Watts district. Not to say that there's anything boring, but many ghetto based communities encounter these heartbreaking activities quite frequently. And there are time where you feel bad for the residents that have to deal with this lifestyle, there is more that comes out of life in these hoods. The quiter moments in this movie deal with family gathering, hanging around with and staying by each other whether good or bad and reconsidering leaving one's home to set positive goals for oneself. It reflects on the unpredictable moments of ghetto life sometimes there are very quiet moments you can hear a pin drop. Then there are moments where things get so out of control, people could just die in the streets without any signs of remorse or hesitation.The characters depicted here are well developed with the maintwo being the aforementioned ones I talked about eariler. We have Caine, who doesn't have a squeaky clean reputation and is not entirely a likable character. But underneath his troubled life, he does have high school education and with that he has the potential to change his life for the better and even has those voicing encouragement for him to do so. By way of contrast, we have O-Dog who feels that committing acts of violence and criminal activity and getting away with it makes him powerful, he seems to enjoy watching camera footage of himself murdering the Korean shopkeepers. But O-Dog isn't the only person who embraces this type of lifestyle. A friend of there's named. Sharif (Vonte Sweet) who seems at one hand entangled into the life at crime, while at the same time is a practicing Muslim (rap legend Tupac Shakur turned it down because he didn't see the connection between the young man's double life). Aside from the hardcore characters, there are a myriad of characters who offer a more softer approach to the narrative. You have Caine's grandparents (Arnold Johnson and Marilyn Coleman) who preach quotes from the Bible, then there a single mother named Ronnie (Jada Pinkett) who is very protective of her young son and teacher who offers sage advive to Caine that being black in America isn't safe and that you will always be the prey.The exploration of ghetto life in Watts come into getting a glance of what really happens in these areas that it has a bit of a documentary vibe going for it. The narrative of the story make you root for Caine the whole way through in hopes that he makes theright decisions in hopes that he can leave behind his past and move forward with his life. It all boils down to the climax which will likely be an emotional one for sure.""Menace II Society"" is a successful ghetto film that's both real and gritty and doesn't leave any stone unturned. If you can hadle the grim deatils you might enjoy this film. It realy is something you have to see for yourself.",Menace II Society
27,gangstahippie,One of the greatest movies about the ghetto,9,4 November 2006,"Rated R for strong violence,drug use and language Quebec Rating:16+(should be 13+) Canadian Home Video Rating:R(should be 18A)I had the opportunity of seeing Menace 2 Society yesterday night on IFC.I have heard about the film before but I never actually saw it.I have seen Boyz In The Hood and it is hard to choose which film is the better one.Boyz In The Hood is more of a dramatic film with more of a plot while Menace 2 Society is more of an action film.Both films are great and I recommend either renting or buying both films.Back in 1993 this film was considered very violent.Its tame by today's standards however.The film starts off with Caine and his crazy friend O-Dog going into a store for a beer.However the owners of the store are afraid of them and one of them says something bad about O-Dog's mother.Then O-Dog kills both of them,robs the store and takes the tape.We briefly see some clips of the 1965 Watts Riots.Then we are taken to the late 1970's where Caine is a little boy.His father is a drug dealer and his mom is a heroin addict.Caine witnesses his father killing another man.Now we see the present day.The year is 1993.Caine has just graduated from high school and the film shows his long summer.The film basically shows us the life of a teenager living in the ghetto.If you forget about the graphic violence and profanity you will see that the film has a good moral message.Unfortunately most people do not see this message when watching the film and think that the film glorifies gang life.This movie is in my Top 20 favorites.Menace 2 Society is an excellent movie and I recommend it.Runtime:97min 10/10",Menace II Society

I mean its not as realistic as Boyz N the hood, but as extreme as it may be i identified with it more, as in one way or another I went through everything that main character, Kaydee (Turner) went through. This film is a gritty, a bit exaggerated story of some young thugs up to no good in Compton during the summer. It has some very good performances including Larenz Tate (Why do fools fall in love, crash) who was great as a crazy hood who doesn't give a fu** and Glenn Plummer who was also great in his role. The whole cast was pretty good other than Tyrin Turner whose performance I could call at best average, that lead part was the only one i didn't like. Jada Pinkett was good in her role, always believable, good early performance from her.

31,moviesleuth2,"Interesting, and at times powerful, look at inner-city LA life",8,25 June 2008,"I don't pretend that I can relate to any of the characters here. But despite that, I developed a sympathy for them. That is because deep down beneath the surface, we are all human.Many films tell a story that the whole movie revolves around. ""Menace II Society"" is not one of them. Although towards the end it sort of develops one, this is mainly a ""slice of life"" film.In some ways the debut feature from The Hughes Brothers resembles Fernando Meirelles' masterpiece, ""City of God,"" especially when it depicts the harsh reality of life for its characters. Yet for the most part, the Allen and Albert Hughes concentrate the ""life"" part instead of the ""death."" It's more about how people live and interact, and generally go about their day-to-day business. Not only does this help us grow to like the characters, but it gives us a look on how life goes in this setting.There are some terrific performances in this film. Caine, the film's protagonist, is a great anchor for the audience. Despite having his share of flaws, he is generally a good guy, who really cares about his girlfriend, Ronnie (the wonderful Jada Pinkett Smith) and her son, and wants to make a good life for himself. He's a person that anyone can sympathize with. Likewise, the always terrific Jada Pinkett Smith is in top form here. She brings her usual cool maturity to her character, and she is the perfect love interest for Caine. Also good is Vonte Sweet in a small but nevertheless a sympathetic role as Sharif, the Muslim who is trying to help everyone else live a better life, even when it annoys everyone else (except the audience).I don't understand why Charles S. Dutton doesn't get any more roles than he does. He is a talented actor, and here he is no different. Despite having only two scenes in the movie, he gives his character raw power that no one else could give. When he is on screen, he fully commands our attention, and everyone else seems to just fade into the background.""Menace II Society"" isn't perfect. Some of the sequences are not credible, and Larenz Tate is too over-the-top as the trigger-happy O-Dog.

But I was very disappointed by the very heavy handed style. Not only the story, characters, dialogue and situations but also in the movie making itself.The editing is too much and of course the sign of the young ambitious director that wants to prove himself: the long shot. After two of these very ""Goodfellas"" like shots, the effect was lost. The shock of the violence went away very quickly as well. Because it was done in such an over the top way that it became very easy to predict. And of course we're left with the other ""edgy"" mark of a director: the main characters death. It's such an easy way out but coming up with a third dimension is much harder. I get that this was the point of the movie. But the theme and message were so over the top. Of course the narration helps so you don't see it coming but in the end it makes it contrived.I'm sure for most people who didn't grow up in this life they see this movie was a ""based on a true story"" perspective. So the impact is a lot stronger because they think that this is what it's really like. Even though just like most movies it's an exaggerated version.

36,jcbutthead86,An Excellent And Powerful Hood Classic From The Hughes Brothers.,10,13 March 2014,"Menace II Society is an excellent and powerful Hood classic that combines terrific direction,a great cast and a fine score. All of those elements make Menace II Society a great Hood movie,one of the best films of the 1990s and The Hughes Brothers at their best.Set in the South Central Los Angeles section of Watts,California,Menace II Society tells the story of Caine(Tyrin Turner),a street hustler who has just recently graduated from High School and is on the streets. Now,Caine is trying to survive on the streets of Watts either by starting a new life on the positive side or become a victim of the streets.Menace II Society is a brilliant and unforgettable Hood movie classic that came out two years after John Singleton's landmark Hood classic Boyz N The Hood(1991)and if Boyz N The Hood is The Godfather of Hood Movies,then Menace II Society would be the Goodfellas(a film that The Hughes Brothers used as a template)of the Hood genre. Right from it's shocking and disturbing opening scene,Menace II Society is a film that pulls you into a dark,urban nightmare that pulls no punches and is a movie that offers no salvation or safe keeping. Despite the tragedy and sadness that was in Boyz N The Hood you felt that there was hope at the end,but in Menace II Society there is no hope or happiness and you will feel that nothing will be good for the characters. Where as Boyz N The Hood focused on a couple of good kids trying to survive in their neighborhood,Menace II Society gives viewers an unflinching look into the world of Watts,California showing world where most of the main characters are criminals and despite being surrounded by urban decay, violence and death don't seem to be bothered by it but embellish it because it is a way of life in the characters eyes and with some of the characters there is no other way. The carelessness and apathy of the some of the characters gives MIIS a nihilistic outlook that is bleak and at times reminds me of Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange(1971)and Tim Hunter's River's Edge(1987)two other films that also have a bleak overtone. What is also great about MIIS is the style of the movie is almost like a Film Noir whether's Caine's narration or the dark lighting that is in the background that makes the movie realistic and at the same time surreal and dream like. The violence in MIIS is shocking and very brutal with nothing being toned down for the viewers showing how violence is shocking and horrific and when the violence happens it will disturb viewers mentally and physically with it's intensity and power. The violence in MIIS is not meant to be fun or exciting but to send a message that violence keeps happening and it's an on going cycle in the hood and ghetto and the violence also sends a message that the things that you do can come back to bite you in a big way. The main character Caine is a fascinating one because we never know what to make of him as a character he's not a good person but he's not a bad person either he's neither a hero or villain because most of his actions good or bad make him a complex character with depth. Caine is a character who is smart as well and you figured that if it wasn't for him being a street hustler he could've been a doctor or banker but drug dealing and hustling on the street is all that he knew what to do. Even though we don't know Caine is a good guy or bad guy there were some scenes in the movie where we as the viewer have sympathy for Caine whether you agree with his actions or not and he is a character in the film that you will never forget. The ending of Menace II Society is amazing and in my opinion one of the most powerful and devastating endings I have ever seen on film and the first time you see the ending it will punch you in the stomach because the ending is something that you will never expect to be so intense and truly gut-wrenching. The ending in Menace II Society will stick with you after you watch it and is one of the reasons the film is a Hood classic. An amazing ending to a great film.The cast is wonderful. Tyrin Turner is excellent as Caine,with Turner bringing sympathy and intensity to the role. Jada Pinkett is wonderful as Ronnie,a friend that Caine looks after. Larenz Tate is brilliant,unforgettable and menacing as O-Dog,Caine's trigger happy friend. Tate is charismatic and frightening in his performance. Vonte Sweet and Ryan Williams are great as Sharif and Stacy,Caine's good friends. Samuel L. Jackson is terrific as Tat,Caine's Father. Charles S. Dutton is outstanding as Mr. Butler,Sharif's Father who offers words of wisdom to Caine. Bill Duke is captivating as Detective,an officer questioning Caine. Glenn Plummer is incredible as Pernell,Caine's Father figure. Rapper Mc Eiht is good as A-Wax,one of Caine's friends. Clifton Powell does a fine job as Chauncey,a friend of the neighborhood. Arnold Johnson(Thomas Lawson)and Marilyn Coleman(Mrs. Lawson)are fantastic as Caine's Grandparents. The direction by Albert and Allen Hughes(The Hughes Brothers) is amazing,with The Hughes Brothers always moving the camera and bringing a great visual style to the film. Terrific direction,Hughes Brothers.The score by QD III(Quincey Jones III)is impressive and moody and matches the tone of the film. Fine score,Jones. There is also a great song by Mc Eiht called Streiht Up Menace which plays at the end. An outstanding song.In final word,if you love The Hughes Brothers or Hood movies I highly suggest you see Menace II Society,an excellent and powerful Hood classic that you will never forget after watching it. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Menace II Society
37,jldmp1,A State Of Nature,7,23 August 2006,"This ranks up there with the most graphic depictions of violence ever to make it to the mainstream. Up there with ""Bad Lieutenant"", ""Reservoir Dogs"" and a few others from an exceptionally violent period in L.A. -- the arrival of 'bellum omnium contra omnes'(the war of all against all); life in Hobbesian terms: nasty, brutish and short.Plainly, this is post-""Scarface"", ""Colors"" & ""Deep Cover"". Mostly it quotes ""Goodfellas"", the Hughes brothers openly stated that it was a motivating factor. This is plain not only from the framing narration, but from the tethering of the camera to the characters, a la Scorcese.What it lacks in originality, it makes up for in energy and commitment from all involved. The advertised allure is 'this is what's real', but that's unimportant in movies. What is important is how the content exists as a cinematic experience of vision, audio, the editing of time and the perception of space. On those dimensions, two things score points: the construction of this around the 'snuff' film, very much like ""Henry..."". This is very clever self-reference, since the entire movie is a snuff film. The 'film within' acts as a maguffin.The other is the ending, which quotes ""Jacob's Ladder"", not only depicting the life flashing before one's eyes, but tying up the loose ends in a visual shorthand. Too bad the Hughes all but used up their best ideas here, they haven't had any really good ideas since this.",Menace II Society

After a brilliant jaw dropping opening, and an amazing first 45 minutes, the film starts to drag, and starts to become the same old thing.A depressing ending leaves this film for non-entertainment value.

39,nicolechan916,"Great acting, choice of narration and directing.",8,4 October 2015,"The film starts off with the murders at a convenience story, and introduces the voice-over narration of the story. I find that this voice-over does wonders at making the audience sympathize with Caine's character. He was born into this society, and therefore is not to blame for his actions and choices. Though his character is not as unpredictably violent like O-Dog, and is somewhat mild. He doesn't carry a gun, and his demeanour isn't that menacing. The voice-over helps to gain some insight into his thoughts and is thus more humanized.Tyrin Turner does a great job portraying his character. As a young boy on the edge of adulthood and just out of high school, Caine has no direction in life, and even has trouble answering whether he cares if he lives or dies. The many close-ups show his confusion at times and at others, his indifference to violence, implying his slow immersion into becoming like O-Dog. O-Dog is represented as a bit of a psychopath with no remorse or conscience for life. It takes little to set him off and Tate does a fantastic job of portraying this terrifying character.This film is well made and the directing shows it. The Hughes Brothers perfectly place juxtapositions of scenes together for maximum impact. The flashback comes in the beginning and establishes Caine's back story while creating sympathy for him. The composition of shots too are done nicely, and complements the way the characters tend to travel in groups.There is a lot of violence in this though, and it serves to show a realistic representation but can be very brutal. As mentioned before, it takes very little to upset O-Dog and turn him loose. The swearing is also very apparent and not one sentence goes by without them. Sometimes whole conversations go by with just cursing.Overall a very powerful representation of ghetto society, where importance is on staying together and protecting one's own. Masculinity is also obviously a very big issue as they constantly try to assert themselves through aggression and cursing. Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",Menace II Society

Shootings to starts proceedings, more deaths and fights in the middle, and as you can imagine, a few killings at the end. Menace to society doesn't manage to be a great movie because it does not bring anything in addition to flicks likes boys in the hood, or movies of the sort. It is interesting that I saw ""Menace to Society"" a few days before ""Notorious"".

It reminds me of clockwork orange where you are invited into the private, sick world of the ""protagonist"", You kind of like him, in spite of the fact that he and his friends are despicable and self centered louts of no redeeming social value. It doesn't fall for the usual socio-rationalizations; these guys didn't have it so bad and they deliberately turned their backs on society and morality. The worse thing about their lives are the role models, most of them despicable but his kind Xtian grandparents, friends and sensible girlfriend make a futile attempt to get him to turn his life around. The men chose the wrong path and were willing to face the consequences. The action was intense and senseless; murders over stupid insults or petty theft. Even KayDee, goes from bad to worse after being the first in his family to graduate high school, as a functionally illiterate drug dealer though. He does a small stretch in county jails then carjacks a man for his car, jewelry and then makes him buy him a burger, at gunpoint. Ole Dog, his murderous og friend, was played by Larenz Tate with a fine fury.

43,FrankBooth_DeLarge,"Menacingly Powerful, and Gritty Urban Drama",9,16 September 2005,"Menace II Society is much more than your typical hood movie. It tells the story of young Caine Lawson, a teen growing up in Watts, California. The opening briefly shows Caine getting caught up in a grocery store shooting with his friend. This was a chilling way to open the movie, as it shows how easy it is for someone in the ghetto to get caught up in the moment and kill someone. During the opening credits, we see footage of the Watts riots that took place during the 60's. Caine narrates the story of his life, explaining how after the riots, drugs came into effect, and affected his home life as a child. After loosing his parents on at the hands of drugs, he was sent to live with his Grandparents. His Grandparents love him, but they struggled to raise him and tried their hardest to keep him out of trouble. Not too long into the movie, after we learn about Caine's early life, we see him graduate from High School. He hopes to leave the life of violence that surrounds him in his neighborhood. After falling victim to a violent car jacking, he is brought into violence and crime himself. As the story progresses, and things spiral downward for Caine, he ends up in a hell of a jam and tries to make a way out of it all. This is an incredible movie. It perfectly balances the ugly crime life and murder of tough inner city neighborhoods, Caine's own personal troubles, police brutality, and drugs. This is a powerful movie with a great story. It has a good message, but in some ways, I thought the film Boyz N the Hood showed the message in a better way. Menace II Society is more focused on the crime involved in inner cities, where as Boyz N the Hood focuses more on the family life of the characters. This is an excellent film that you should see if you ever get the chance. It has a good message, and it has some very moving moments in it. If you enjoyed this, I also recommend Boyz N the Hood, and you'll probably enjoy the Wayans brothers' spoof, Don't be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood.",Menace II Society

The story in MENACE is all too familiar(it reminded me of CARLITO's WAY and BOYZ 'N THE HOOD)and simply isn't interesting anymore after a while.There's some good acting in this film and some scenes are very well executed by the Hughes' brothers, but it doesn't make up for a good movie.

45,whoTheFuqRyou,Possibly the best urban movie ever made,10,3 April 2003,"**possible spoilers**Menace II Society is definitely an unforgettable story as it is still spoken about today when you mention 'hood movies or black film.  It revolves around Caine(Tyrin Turner) and his life.  The film also shows in graphic detail about Caine's unfortunate childhood from his father(Samuel L. Jackson) bein' a hustler, to his mom being a heroin-addict who is so strung-out to the point where she steals out of Tat's stash just to get high which then 'causes Tat to raise his hand to her, to even witnessing his father kill someone over owed money at a card game(...and it wasn't the last) Also in Caine's circle is O-Dog(Larenz Tate), who in my unhumble opinion was the most unforgettable character of this movie.  His short temper and trigger-happy tendencies made O-Dog such an unforgettable character surpassing the likes of Doughboy in Boyz N The Hood. I was real impressed with Caine's retrospective break down of his 'hood with the riots to the drugs, and before all of that - Dog shows a little of what I was talking about earlier at the grocery store in a very memorable beginning.  Jada Pinkett is also in this as Ronnie, a single mother whose baby is fathered by Pernell serving a life sentence - who Caine looks highly up to.  It's a very gritty look at the life in the streets and how decision can affect your life, more less be the difference between your life and death.  Very well scripted and acted, it really felt like the real thing and there aren't many that will ever come this close as this did...This is a must have on VHS or DVD or whatever unforgettable classic 10/10",Menace II Society

48,realityinmind,"Sorry, but...",5,7 July 2018,"Whoever said this movie is 7 stars and the best black gangster movie ever.... smh no. The acting is horrible. And I know that it came out in the 90s but that is no excuse. The worst part of it all is the re-used soundbytes. Such as when the shootout occurs at the market, you can hear the actors saying many different expletives but they are the same recording used over and over. Its horrible. Basically what happened is that the directors were lazy and had the actors record a phrase in the studio, and then they used it in many different places throughout the movie. While the phrase ""m----r f----r"" is said 39 times in the movie, it is actually only recorded 18 times. That means that 21 times that the phrase is said the directors told the engineers to just use the phrase from another part of the movie. HORRIBLE!The story has no meaning. None of the characters learn anything, no moral is expressed. its not like in Boyz n the Hood when the characters are constantly facing decisions that inevitably lead to a lesson to be learned in ethics. In Menace II Society the lesson is ""if you kill a bunch of people and then move away, then you will be fine in life. But if you don't hurry up and leave in time then you will be killed."" Or maybe ""if you get a girl pregnant then you can just leave that girl and move away to a new city and everything will be fine, but if you don't then you will die."" This is ridiculous.This is the first movie directed by the Hughes Brothers, and it was over-hyped because of a bunch of other similar (and better) movies that came out around the same time.

All I see is teen women getting pregnant, absent fathers (in jail or dead), disdain for hard work, study and productivity.

Year after year, the murder rate reflects either 100 percent black on black or no less than 90 percent of the same.

I lived in a government housing while I was growing up and while this movie reflects a lot of the stuff you have to deal with in ghettos, it amplified it way too much. Just a movie trying to act more hardcore than the previous ones. This movie may reflect a few people's lives, but if you can identify with it, you should be in prison rather than watching this movie.

But then again, I don't think that really mattered.This movie is more bleak than BOYZ, and that's to its advantage. It has a chance to go into darker depths. But in the end, it seemed pointless and it never really went anywhere, even though it took its sweet time getting to that destination. The structure is terribly shaky, and not every movie needs a story, but the film still didn't intrigue me or leave me meditating to its lifestyle.I got the idea after the first few minutes. There is no hope. And though the beginning was energetic and controversial, and this film contains great performances from Bill Duke and Charles S. Dutton, it seemed like a dull web of cliches.

You are truly rooting for him despite his mistakes. Caine is far from perfect, but in a weird way he is just figuring out who he is and whether he actually cares about living.O-Dog is the stand out. He steals every scene he is in. Larenz Tate is one of the greatest actors of all time. His acting range is phenomenal. The directing, cinematography and acting is amazing. This movie is structured a lot like Goodfellas. I think the directors did that on purpose.This movie is NOT easy to watch. It is very violent and very heavy at times, but the movie is very authentic.

I was offended at the time, when the studio tried to market this movie with Boyz in the Hood.  The two movies are completely different.  Just because it deals with African Americans, it doesn't make the two films similar. And what is up with the ""ghetto films""?  I haven't heard such racist remarks in a while.  So many complained about blaxploitation films, years before.  Menace II Society, however, is the real offensive stereotype.

While I agree it was terrible, but what we need are better films.  Menace II society is one of the most gripping films ever made.  More horrifying than Freddie Kruger, Friday the 13th or whatever horror film you can name because this, unfortunately, is reality.  Menace steps out of the tired rehashed 'ghetto' mentality with real characters, real motivation (whether you agree with it or not) good acting, and great writing and direction. I salute the Hughes brothers for their strength in getting a film as difficult to watch as this one on the screen.  A great film, I believe, affects you once you leave the theater.  In that respect, this is great film.",Menace II Society
78,gatyngaj,"There IS hope, you just have to work for it",1,23 August 2008,"There is always one light of up in just about any given film, with a fatal flaw that bogs the quality of it down. In Menace II Society there *is* none. Or maybe the actors or the direction could have saved it, but nothing, and I mean nothing, can overshadow the storyline. It's absolutely dreadful.The film centers on the milestones and many idiotic mistakes of Caine, the main character who lives in a predominantly black area that unfortunately is inhabited by equally morally deprived residents. If you haven't guessed what his fate is from the very beginning, he ends up getting shot, deserving every bullet that penetrates his body. Seriously. Caine, his friend, and nearly all the people in his 'hood minus the little children and Ronnie appear to have no morals whatsoever. They are all caught in a vacuum of moral depravity. Because of this, Caine continuously takes every golden chance to improve his life and throws it away until he finally gets what was coming in the end. Being arrested and even having a baby has done nothing to make him step back and think before he finds himself throwing swings and making yet another fatal action. Because he and many of the characters are so corrupted, there is absolutely no sympathy radiating from me.The film is not in any way ""powerful."" Maybe in a bizarre world where the more violence there is in a film, the better the message comes across. If you look past the scenes that are supposed to have a strong message (for instance, the end where Caine is shot at least eight times), you realize that this boy had EVERY bullet coming! I don't believe it takes that many mistakes to realize that one has to clean up his act. The story had some potential, but if the writers injected just a bit of morality into the main character, and directed him so that he was more of a dynamic character, then I would have had sympathy for him. Halfway through the film, there's no other action to take but to throw in the towel on Caine; the boy will never learn.I decided to review this years after it was released, after various attempts to appreciate this film for its critical acclaim and its attempt to show that throwing away every chance life gives you is deadly. After years of trying to see what made this film so popular, I still don't know why some people even put it a mark above Boyz N The Hood. I still say that the graphic violence, which appears almost glamorized in this film, tricked people into thinking Menace was up a notch from Boyz.I stand by my opinion, this is an overrated dud.",Menace II Society
79,philomot,Simply a great movie,9,28 August 2001,"I've probably seen this movie 20 times since it came out and I still watch it when it comes on television. I must say that some of the acting seems a bit corny now, but the images, characters and the story are still as gripping as ever. MIIS is basically a remake of the gangster classic Public Enemy from 1931. At that time Warner Brothers studios had directors that were interested in telling real stories. Another example also from 1931, I think, was I'm a Fugitive from a Chain Gang. Basically these films were about how life was in the early thirties for some people, like gangsters or poor people.Anyway MIIS does this too. People compare it to Boyz 'n' da Hood and Do the Right Thing. Why do the Right Thing? That movie has a completely different theme than this one. It deals directly with racism, MIIS deals indirectly with racism, but is about living a life of crime in the ghetto. Boy 'n' the hood is similar, but is a morality play and also coming of age drama. Just, because black people act and direct a movie doesn't mean it's exactly the same subject. MIIS is more a tragedy, as soon as you hear the voice over of Caine and he begins to tell his story you know that this is not going to end well.Furthermore the major part of the acting is great. Also a good thing is the dialogue in the script, it's all slang. When I first saw this movie I couldn't understand a word they were saying for the first ten minutes. This makes it more realistic, but also gives an almost Shakespeare like feel, because you have to listen with more effort to get the dialogue.Lastly for those people who say this film is racist and stereotypical. Please look a little bit further. Stereotypes are put forward yes, but not to characterize all young black men in the hood, they are stereotypes of individuals that exist, the nut, the player, the religious fanatic, the hustler etc. And even though they are stereotyped the actors do a really good job in deepening ther characters. I can't find any racism in this film with the best of my ability, I think the directors just wanted to make a film that would be very impressive and they succeeded in that. Maybe you would like to see a more Mr. Rogers type of movie which Caines grandparents watch as O-Dog visits. A movie about a world where everything is hunky dory.
On a last note the point the movie makes is that it is not only your actions, but also your environment that inevitably lead to your fate. Even if you take the right actions the odds are highly stacked against you in places where there is little opportunity to get out of the mess you're in.",Menace II Society

Some people also might be offend by this movie by it degrading black people, but it in fact was aimed to the black audience. Also the movie isn't just about violence and drugs, its also a story about survivng in the hood and there is indeed a plot.

On our way out to a movie theater, I ran up to the entertainment room to grab my jacket. As I entered, I heard the first line of ""Menace"" from a television which had been left on. In the 30 seconds it took me to put on my jacket, I was drawn into the flick.As the first scene came to a close, my buddies came looking for me. It didn't take long for them to realize that we wouldn't be going anywhere.At such an age this movie shocked and excited me. It left me in awe and on the edge of tears.In my early twenties (and after I'd seen it several times), the movie made me laugh out loud. The clever dialog, even in tenuous situations, is genius. Cheeseburgers, anyone?Now in my late twenties, I consider this a classic. Take your other gang movies and throw them out the window.

This movie punched you in the face..... and then kicked you while you were down. That was the whole point to it. Now, the movie could've spent more time showing the intricate realities of the lifestyle some of the characters chose to lead, but it didn't need to. That may have helped the audience identify with the characters, but it would have just made the fact that this is fiction overt.  It seemed real because of the absence of hyperbole.  This is real, this is what's going on. Some didn't like it but aver it is a good film and well done.  Fine, you don't have to like it, the movie could be sublime or it could be lackluster or mediocre, you don't have to enjoy it.

91,kungfuju1212,"Dark, explosive and intense, Menace II Society is the greatest hood movie ever made.",10,30 July 2002,"Menace II Society is easily the greatest hood movie ever made.  Some may argue in favor of Juice or Boyz 'N The Hood (which received a higher level of critical acclaim) but Menace II Society captures the desperation and mindlessness of angry hood youths unlike any other film.  It's a shame that Tyger Williams' screenplay was not awarded for it's depiction of the hood's harsh reality.  His dialogue is realistic and quirky, but funny and chilling at the same time.  Instead of painting the characters like the cartoon cliches they make themselves out to be.  Instead of glorifying their violent ways, the Hughes Brothers present these characters as being trapped by the ghetto, and use it as an excuse to live recklessly, steal and kill. Instead of the overacting ""you shot my baby!"" scene of Singleton's take on life in the hood, the film is packed with several touching scenes, which kick in at a gut level.  Specifically, the scene where Caine is playing a boxing videogame with his girlfriend's son and teaches him how to fire a gun, and the mother runs in and pulls him away.  We also learn about Caine's relationship with the baby's father, Glenn Plummer (who delivers a brief but memorable performance as a reformed, reeducated gang banger locked behind bars.)  He then sheds a tear and tells him that he was ""like a father to him"".  He closes his eyes trying to hold back his feelings and asks Caine to ""teach his son how to be a man.""  In those simple words lie the essence of this film, as in earlier scenes Caine recalls the advice his real father gave him, including how he was taught to cook crack.  The concept of father figures and the Id is touched upon in little detail, and in a way they seem like society's orphans but it is impossible to justify these character's lives, especially in the case of O-Dog.  In the opening scene, he blows a Korean store clerk's brains out of the back of his head and murders his wife for making a comment about his ""mama"", then steals the surveilance tape and shows it off to his friends.  If there ever was a character who ""just didn't give a f**k"" it's O-Dog.  After Caine and his cousin are shot and robbed, they retaliate and exact their bloody revenge, in some of the most perfectly directed and edited scenes of the film.  Hughes Brothers showed promise with their 1993 debut, and it has gone on to withstand the test of time, and has become a bigger favorite than BOYZ.  The acting is more heartfelt and the characters are more clearly defined.  Either they express minimal aspirations to want to get out of the hood, or their too caught up in the gangland violence and mafioso-like status they long for.  In one particular scene, O-Dog murders a fiend in cold blood for offering a sexual favor in return for crack.  He then picks up a bag of cheeseburgers lying next to the corpse and asks his friends if they want any.  The characters seem to enjoy violence (in a manner similar to the characters in Goodfellas, who pillage out of neccesity AND habit) and don't want to let go of their vigilant lives.  The end is somewhat dissapointing because in it's own garbled way it's telling us that their is now escape from the hood.  The only reality is their own disillusionment with any other way of life.",Menace II Society

First off, the authenticity talked about in other reviews about ghetto life is so ridiculous I can't express how ignorant those people are. I grew up poor, so while I'm white, I can relate on some level to a lot of the trials of young black men in movies like Boyz n the Hood. That movie seemed pretty accurate. Those were just normal lower middle class to poor boys caught up in awful circumstances. Their lives resembled the rest of America in a lot of ways, but were punctuated by brief bouts of extreme gang and drug-related violence. That's pretty close to real.Menace II Society, more like menace to reality. For one, there's no way a neighborhood could get this bad without the National Guard getting called in. I'm not kidding when I say that the level of violence and the frequency with which it is portrayed in this movie would make it worse than a literal war zone. Another thing about the movie that angered me was the way in which the young men were portrayed. I don't know how the people of Watts felt about this movie when it came out, but if this was about where I grew up and the people I grew up around, I would be deeply insulted by it. I can't imagine a place filled with so many evil and useless people as the ones portrayed in this movie. I was surprised to see that it was directed by black men, because it struck me as racist when I was watching it. I was thinking to myself, ""is this what movie goers really think inner city black people are like?"" What a joke. Even more annoying after watching this film was going online and reading all these rave reviews about the ""authentic"" nature of its portrayal. All by people who have never lived in a poor neighborhood nor spent any time in the ghetto. I've spent some time in some of the most crime ridden places in America and let me tell you, this kind of thing just does not go on the way they show it here. Sure there's elevated violent crime, but just go look at crime statistics for the early 90's in these places. This little group of kids would have exceeded the entire violent crime rate of Watts they did so many bad things in such a short amount of time.

Similar movies include Boyz in the Hood and Dead Presidents. Menace II Society is, in my opinion far superior to either of these others films, featuring better acting, more life like characters and a better message. Unlike many other films, Menace II Society does not attempt to blame the crime and violence of the ghettos completely on racism and society, but recognizes that the inhabitants of such neighborhoods must make their own choices, and are responsible for their own destinies. The film provides the viewer with an uncensored, often brutal, glimpse into life in American ghettos, and asks some very important questions about American culture and society.

All right?""Well, let's see, he carjacks a poor guy in a fat-food lane, threatening to kill him for not ordering cheese on the burger. He knocks a girl up then treats her like utter garbage. Her cousin comes to defend her honor and this pig stomps on him, and kicks him when he's down. He's dishonorable, a liar, a villain, a fiend, a murderous cad.

103,patrickhest,"Somewhat enjoyable, but overall disappointing,",4,22 January 2017,"I went into this movie with high hopes, but once I was done, I was surprised at just how flawed it was. I don't regret watching the film- but it had too many problems for me to ignore. I'll start with minor things. Some of the editing (cuts, sound, etc.) is not great. Such as a slow motion scene with sound that doesn't match up with the motion, or a cut that goes to the character smiling to a character frowning in the next. Although not a huge issue, it's a bother and too obvious to ignore. It also had some things not done poorly, but not exactly done well either. It was shot decently, but nothing special. Although it won a Best Cinematography award, don't expect a beautiful film. It's not bad, just not great. It does what it's supposed to, and that's all. But on a positive note, (if you watch the unrated cut) this movie's violence doesn't hold back. It's presented how it should be- bloody and up close. It doesn't cut away from and gruesome shot, because it wants you to see it. The violence is done well, and I'm glad it doesn't restrain itself. The movie gets it's setting right. What everyone wears, what everyone says, what music they listen to... all feels from the era of which it takes place. The soundtrack does do a good job of making you feel like you're in the time and place the film takes place in, but it could've used a track or two besides the hip-hop and R&B tracks. So many films like this one like to only use these kinds of songs, and some scenes would've been better with a different track. Such as a brief sex scene later in the film (which comes out of nowhere, I might add) that is very cheesy, and the cliché song only makes it worse. Although the writing is not terrific, the dialogue, in terms of the way they talk, is. They speak like these characters actually would have, and it doesn't feel overdone. They talk like real friends would, and that makes the whole experience more enjoyable, because you feel as if you are watching actual friends. This leads to a big flaw in the film- the acting. To say the least, it fell short. No performance in this whole film stands out as great. The only performance that stands out at all is Jada Pinkett Smith's, which is not great, but good- and better than most in the film, if not all. Much of the delivery feels lazy, and a most characters are just unconvincing. Caine's narration, for instance, was a little hard to listen to. Compared to the rest of his character's dialogue, it was confusing to hear both from the same actor, with a huge gap in performance quality. He's not the only one, either. It's hard to tell who exactly is at fault here- the actors or the Hughes brothers- but overall, the acting felt weak, and took away from the movie quite a bit. Once I finished Menace 2 Society, I immediately realized it's biggest issues. We are introduced to many characters that are presented as important, but it doesn't take it's time to let us actually spend time with these characters, until they almost feel like extras with lines. Although it focused on a select few characters, they too still feel underdeveloped. From O-Dog, to Caine's grandparents. This movie moves too fast for you to care about the characters and in turn, become invested in their lives. From the beginning scene when Cain is a kid that seems to get cut off out of nowhere, to the ending that feels too rushed to feel any emotion for- It made the whole experience a lot less enjoyable than it would've been. Even the main focus itself seems inconsistent and confused. This movie moves all over the place, and by the end, the impact of the last few moments is severely reduced, because it never lets us get to know Cain, and everyone in his life, as well as we should.",Menace II Society
104,BeardfaceOG,Greatest hood film ever made,10,16 July 2021,"The central character, Caine (Turner) is unsure of where his head lies, caught between the need to make a better life for himself while remaining loyal to the street. In a jaw-dropping opening sequence Caine and his psychotic homie O-Dog (Tate) are caught on a security camera blasting a shopkeeper foolish enough to talk smack at them - the film studies the tragic way in which the patterns of violence are mirrored from generation to generation. Here kids are taught to hold a gun before they can ride a bike. The acting is like a whiplash, hard and gritty, yet, especially with Turner's floundering Caine, touching upon a fierce emotional core while the soundtrack blares out banging hip hop to the stomach-pounding beat of gunfire. The Hughes pack more punch into their raw 97 minutes than a catalogue of Spike Lee or John Singleton movies.",Menace II Society
105,mymilkshakez,This is the best movie that was made in 1993!!!,10,23 December 2005,"Menace II society is the best movie that I have ever seen.Tyrin Turner is the best actress I have ever seen.When I seen it for the first time three weeks ago this movie touched me in a special way.Believe it or not this movie had me thinking whether I wanted to ""LIVE OR DIE"",then I went to thinking about what Tyrin Turner said about how funny it is growing up in the hood. I have never experienced it but i feel his pain.When I was finished watching the movie I found myself in a puddle of tears.I am not just saying this but I would really like or really even love to meet Tyrin Turner in person one day from the very,very bottom of my heart and see how his personal life is different from his Hollywood life.

106,mr_bigshot2003,great story,10,13 February 2006,this no holds barred hood movie that tells a story of choices that you have to make in life (whether to go the right or the wrong way)is a well adapted version of some of the thing s that young teenagers went through around those times in the ghettos of l.a . The great thing about this film other than the great acting is the captivating storyline and the fact that the director do sen't try and glorify violence or crime he portrays it in a way of the youngster Kaydee simply following what he was told from when he was a youngster and not knowing anything better than that.As it shows you when Kaine was younger he did not have a positive role model hes role model was Pynell a street gang banger who gets locked away and then years later when Pynell is locked up and Kaine is older Kaine is right there doing the same thing Pynell done when he was his age . This movie should be shown to every teenager who thinks street life is cool 10 out of 10 for this one.,Menace II Society
107,richardobrien-63690,Menace II Society is Due For a Remake or a Sequel - The Hughes Brothers and an Underrated Masterpiece,10,2 September 2019,"Menace II Society tells a story of immeasurable importance. The magnitude of skill present in Menace II Society is a wonder on it's own, however Menace II Society exceeds one's expectations of a film from the 'hood' genre of the early 1990's. Menace II Society was directed by the Black, fraternal twin brothers, Albert and Allen Hughes. Directing Menace II Society was divided up between the brothers: One brother, Albert, would work mainly with the actors, while the other brother, Allen focused on the directing of each scene. They each received story credit for the film, as the screenplay was written by Tyger Williams. Darin Scott produced Menace II Society. I don't recognize Mr. Scott's name from any other projects in the arts and entertainment industry, though his name is worth remembering due to his work on Menace II Society.
Caine is a well-written protagonist, more so than the protagonist of most other films. He is a dynamic character, yet makes choices that are unhealthy and unwise. Such a discombobulated youth is never portrayed so well in modern day pictures. Caine is distraught over the murder of one of his family members- a murder that he witnessed first hand. In his journey, Caine encounters conflict with society. The brutality and cruel violence of young men living in urban neighborhoods in 1993 lead Caine to make drastic choices early on in his life.
One aspect of Menace II Society that audiences may overlook is it's realism. The 1993 Hughes brothers 'hood film' is not romanticized. A crack-addicted basehead, played by Rodney Barnes, is shot to death in broad daylight in an alley; No one around seems to react or pay any attention whatsoever to the single gunshot that went off. You might believe such looniness can only be possible in films, however South Central Los Angeles was an extreme hot bed for crime and violence in 1992-1993.
The movie beautifully showcases a brutal period in recent American history. I would personally like to develop a sequel or a remake of Menace II Society to exploit it's potential. Menace II Society shall make for a riveting blockbuster remake or an iconic series to be continued over 26 years after it's predecessor.",Menace II Society
