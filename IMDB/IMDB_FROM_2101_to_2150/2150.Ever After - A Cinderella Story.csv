0,TheLittleSongbird,Delightful retelling of a classic fairytale!,10,20 February 2009,"This movie is beautiful, and I am not just saying that. The cinematography and costumes(especially Danielle's swan dress) was gorgeous, especially in the ballroom scene. I loved the fact that they made it 16th century, that was really clever. The music was so beautiful, that at times I was reduced to tears. Now for the characters. Drew Barrymore, with an excellent English accent, has never been more beautiful as feisty servant Danielle, and the twists Andy Tennant put in allowed the romance of her and Dougray Scott(also excellent) to shine even brighter. Angelica Huston was deliciously evil as Rodmilla the evil stepmother, and Patrick Godfrey was surprisingly good as Leonardo Da Vinci. The stepsisters were also a delight to watch. The witty dialogue had some truly funny bits, like the scene in the woods, and some tearjerkers, the death of Danielle's father. The introduction of the Grimm Brothers was also great. All in all, I highly recommend this movie to all those who love romance. 10/10. Bethany Cox",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
1,SnoopyStyle,neither realism nor fanciful costume drama,6,28 September 2013,"The well known familiar fairy tale is bought into Renaissance Italy. Her evil stepmother Rodmilla (Anjelica Huston) has reduced Danielle (Drew Barrymore) to little more than a maid after the death of her father. Marguerite (Megan Dodds) is the horrible stepsister, and Jacqueline (Melanie Lynskey) is nice one. Prince Henry (Dougray Scott) can't stand his home, and runs into Danielle one day as well as Leonardo da Vinci (Patrick Godfrey) rescuing his Mona Lisa painting. Leonardo would be the fairy godmother.Drew Barrymore is doing a weird British accent in a costume drama taking place in 16th century Italy. There are castles and horses but little grandeur. Although it's a nice idea, it doesn't have any tension or magic. It's not gritty enough to be real nor beautiful enough to be fanciful. The story itself is good triumphing over evil just like the fairy tale.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
2,jboothmillard,Ever After: A Cinderella Story,7,10 January 2012,"I had heard about this and knew the leading actress, I may have even tried to watch it once before, but I was determined to see this version of the famous fairytale story, told in a completely different way, from director Andy Tennant (Fools Rush In, Anna and the King, Hitch). Basically, set in the early 19th Century, France, wealthy landowner Auguste (The Living Daylights' Jeroen Krabbé) married Baroness Rodmilla De Ghent (Anjelica Huston), and after he died she inherited his fortune. She also forced his only daughter Danielle (Drew Barrymore) to become a slave, her stepmother treating her like dirt, and her stepsisters almost as bad, Marguerite (Megan Dodds) being the horrid one, and only Jacqueline (Heavenly Creatures' Melanie Lynskey) being the relatively kinder one. The young girl stays positive though that one day things will change for the better, and that dream may come true when Prince Henry (Dougray Scott) wants to escape the life in the kingdom, only to be spotted trying to flee by her. She is paid to be silent, which she does remain, and the Prince meanwhile comes across the famous painter Leonardo Da Vinci (Patrick Godfrey) heading for the royal court with his famous Mona Lisa painting, and returning to the castle the Prince settles back. He also meets the Baroness who hopes that he will marry Margurite, but they are unaware that Danielle is using the money she received to improve her image, and pose as a courtier dressed like a fine Lady, and he is attracted not just by her beauty, but her spirit. After giving herself the name Nicole De Lancret, after her mother, and the title Comtesse, she is forced to run away, taking servant Maurice (Walter Sparrow) with her, and the next thing we see is King Francis (Timothy West) making a deal with his son, he must announce his engagement to a woman he chooses by the stroke of midnight at a ball in five days, otherwise he will marry Spanish Princess Gabriella (Virginia García). During the next few days Danielle keeps up the pretence of being in the higher class of people, and she does eventually bump into the Prince again who is delighted to see her, and it comes to the night of the ball, but he discovers the truth about her identity. In the end his feelings for her are too strong and he forgive any deception of being a slave, and after finally ridding herself of the her horrid stepmother and stepsister Danielle escapes, and it is a happily ever after for Henry and Danielle. Also starring Judy Parfitt as Queen Marie and Jeanne Moreau as Grande Dame. Barrymore gives a good natural performance as the downtrodden but spirited beauty, Scott is good as the Prince who wants to get his own and find his true love, and of course Huston is a good choice as the nasty stepmother who treats the beauty with contempt and only cares about money and going higher in society. This is not your typical version of Cinderella, there is no magic, no glass slippers, no pumpkin carriage and no Fairy Godmother, this is a more grown up version that treats the story as if it is historical fact, so traditional medieval era costumes and locations, but the premise remains relatively the same, it is an interesting romantic fantasy. Very good!",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
3,moonspinner55,Cinderella revisited (and revised),5,16 March 2006,"The Cinderella tale revised (and some may say improved upon) by turning the title character into a 16th Century servant girl with a feisty spirit, an educated mind, and a fearsome right hook! Drew Barrymore vacillates between victimized puppy, coy young woman and pre-feminist challenger in the lead, convincing the Prince of France that she's of nobility while captivating him with her inner-strength; still, she's fetching, despite an uneven accent and too many movie-star close-ups of her self-conscious smile. Anjelica Huston is perfectly fine as the hissably evil stepmother (she's appropriately contemptible without stepping over into camp) and Dougray Scott is the twinkling Prince (with an over-sized codpiece which seems like a sight-gag nobody took note of). Lovely locations and production design, though the film disappoints by cheating us out of two very important moments--an escape and a ceremony--and by stretching this tale out a tad too long. ** from ****",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
4,edwagreen,Ever After...Never Before **1/2,6,26 May 2009,"The movie has a lovely musical score.I write never before since this version of the Cinderella classic really tries to bring in social class inequities into the mix of things. Problem is that the fairy tale is for young people basically so the message can get lost quite rapidly.The acting kudos here really go to Anjelica Huston who really captures the role of the stepmother in the way that it was supposed to be. A baroness who looks on Drew Barrymore, her step-daughter with utter contempt and disdain, for in this version, she soon realizes that she must get rid of her created Cinderella so that her daughter, Marguerite, can marry the prince. Do I see that the other step-daughter was actually sympathetic to the Barrymore Cinderella character?The prince's father comes off as a real idiot here. The mother, acts as a queen, and as a mother for what is in her son's best interest.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

7,Doylenf,"Angelica Huston is terrific in this new twist on the ""Cinderella"" legend...",6,13 September 2006,"The best thing about EVER AFTER are the performances of Drew Barrymore, Dougray Scott and, most of all, Angelica Huston as the deliciously evil wicked stepmother. Good chemistry between Barrymore and Scott helps keep the female fans interested in the slowly developed romantic interest, and an appreciation for costumes, settings and photography broadens the appeal for everyone else.But it's by no means perfect. First of all, it can't make up its mind whether it's a modern parable, an old-fashioned love story, a comic soap opera or all of the above. At times the dialog has an anochronistic slant, much too modern to be spoken by characters in period costumes that look authentically medieval.And there are portions of the film that simply sag and stay stifled until some new twist comes along. But evidently young romantics find it the answer to their dreams as long as Drew Barrymore and Dougray Scott find their way toward a happy ending, even without a glass slipper. Both young players deserve meatier material but certainly have enough charm to keep the flimsy story entertaining enough.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
8,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Interesting re-imagined version of Cinderella, with good acting and reasonable writing",7,16 August 2006,"As this came on TV, I decided to grant it a chance, in spite of not being a great fan of fairy tales. I found it quite entertaining, even if there are maybe a few lapses in writing. The plot is quite good, and progresses nicely throughout. The pacing is fair. The dialog is well-written and equally delivered. The acting is all pretty good... it was a pleasant surprise to see Melanie Lynskey(whom I so far have only seen one other place... as Rose on Two and a Half Men, a role that doesn't require all that much talent) play a much more grounded character, and do so very well. Dougray Scott was good. Anjelica Huston portrayed the evil stepmother of the story really good. Barrymore was well-chosen for the tom-boyish lead who is not stripped of feminine traits. The humor is decent... personally, I didn't laugh much, though several of Drew's character's actions had me cheering for her. The cinematography and editing was quite good throughout. The prelude and prologue are both well-written and fit in well with the tone and direction of the film. The mood isn't too sweet and while this is a fairy tale, it still managed to entertain me(and I have never found works in that genre to be of any interest to me). The only thing I truly didn't like about this was the line near the beginning which tried to place one definite meaning upon the smile of the Mona Lisa. I refer to the marvelously talented director Stanley Kubrick, who quite eloquently and perfectly expressed why such a thing should never be done. I recommend this to fans of fairy tales and/or the actors involved. 7/10",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
9,anaconda-40658,Barrymore Ever After.,7,19 August 2015,"Ever After: A Cinderella Story (1998): Dir: Andy Tennant / Cast: Drew Barrymore, Dougrey Scott, Angelica Huston, Richard O'Brien, Melanie Lynskey: Winning charm brought to life with enchanting set pieces, beautiful photography and a title suggesting fairy tale love. Drew Barrymore plays a slave girl who impresses the Prince yet he doesn't understand her. One of the film's finer points is that it can make you laugh so naturally. When surrounded by bandits Barrymore is given opportunity to walk away with anything she can carry, so she stoops down and hoists the bewildered Prince over her shoulder. It is moments such as this that are rewarding but unfortunately the screenplay has not enough such moments. Directed by Andy Tennant who made Fools Rush In, and given an ending that will surprise no one. Barrymore is fantastic playing this slave girl as a bold underdog. Dougrey Scott plays a great foil to her lifestyle, as the Prince who is constantly overwhelmed with her persona. Supporting characters are the pitiful one-dimensional with Angelica Huston as the wicked step-mother as well as Richard O'Brien who makes a wasted appearance. Well made in terms of production but its familiarity may hinder its overall appeal. Modernization works in the end where Barrymore doesn't necessarily encounter stagecoaches but the slipper stays in tact. Score: 7 / 10",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
10,Wuchakk,"The ""real story"" that Cinderella was based on",7,20 April 2015,"""Ever After: A Cinderella Story"" (1998) stars Drew Barrymore as Danielle, the daughter of a wealthy commoner in 16th century France. When her father unexpectedly dies, Danielle becomes the servant girl of her arrogant stepmother (Angelica Huston). When she runs into the prince of the kingdom (Dougray Scott), he becomes captivated by her honesty, humility, wisdom and beauty. Meanwhile, her stepmother schemes to have her shallow daughter (Megan Dodds) marry the prince. Melanie Lynskey plays the younger stepsister while Patrick Godfrey plays Leonardo Da Vinci and Lee Ingleby plays Danielle's guy-friend from her youth.This is a quality costume dramedy/romance. Shot entirely in France at no less than four châteaus (castles), as well as some sweet wilderness areas, the film is awe-inspiring just to look at. The story is a little convoluted, so you have to pay attention to keep track of what's going on. Drew shines as the protagonist and Scott is great as the prince. The movie proves that you don't have to have overt sex scenes and nudity for a film like this to be effective or successful (which it was at the box office). I also like the message concerning the idiocy of societal classes and how one of the stepsisters is actually a quality soul.The film runs 121 minutes.GRADE: B+",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
11,Smells_Like_Cheese,...and they lived happily ever after; but what happened before that?,8,12 February 2004,"I remember when this movie was released, I saw it so many times in the theater with my friends. We were 13, perfect age group for the film and we adored everything about this movie. It's years later and I bought the movie on DVD making me wonder if the movie did hold up as well as I remembered. Well, it doesn't hold the same magic as I saw when I was a kid, but Ever After still holds a certain charm that is absolutely irresistible. I think between the writing and the characters, this was a great update on a classic story. Every little girl has dreamed of being Cinderella, the girl who has been dumped on her whole life and then the man of your dreams comes to save you as you live happily ever after. Drew Barrymore takes lead through this charming fairy tale of a strong woman with the good faith that one day things will go as they should and she'd live in a utopia.Danielle de Barbarac is a young girl who lives in a manor with her widowed father whom she adores. When Danielle is eight, her father marries the haughty Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent, who has two daughters about Danielle's age. Soon after, Auguste dies. Rodmilla is envious of Danielle, and treats her like a servant after Auguste's death. The Baroness has fallen into debt. Marguerite, her spoiled older daughter, has grown to be cruel, arrogant, and bad-tempered; while the younger, Jacqueline, is kindhearted, soft-spoken, and constantly overlooked. In the orchard one day, Danielle encounters a man attempting to steal her father's old horse. She pelts him with apples, knocking him to the ground, and is horrified to learn that the man is Henry, the Prince of France. Henry explains that his own horse was lamed in his attempt to escape stifling royal life. He forgives Danielle in exchange for her silence, and rewards her with money. Danielle resolves to use the money to rescue Maurice, an old family servant whom Rodmilla had sold. While her step-family is out of the house, Danielle dons a noblewoman's dress and goes to court. She finds Maurice about to be shipped to the Americas, and demands his release. Prince Henry sees this and is impressed with Danielle's intellect, strength of character, and beauty. Danielle refuses to tell Henry her name, though eventually she leaves him with the name of her mother, Comtesse Nicole de Lancret. Leading him to want to speak with her more only to fall in love with her not knowing that she is a true Cinderella.I still like this movie very much. Drew and the other actors may not have a great accent but they still all tried their best. Angelica Huston, what a great choice as the wicked step mother and I use that term lightly. There is this beautiful scene between her and Danielle, she starts to tell Danielle about her father and how Angelica barely knew him, you see a sense of humanity in her and then she starts to look at Danielle with love but realizes how hurt she still is that her father cared more for Danielle than his own wife. You understand how she could be angry and jealous, not justifying what she did to Danielle, but her motivation is understandable and I love the punishment she receives for what she did. There's still a scene that gets a great reaction from me, when Marguerite just spitefully tells Danielle how her mother is dead and Danielle just goes up to her and gives her one hell of a punch, I think that's when I fell in love with her! What strength was given to the character making the film more than just a ""happily ever after"" film, but a wonderful fairy tale with enjoyable characters, a wonderful romance, humor and most of all leaves you with a smile on your face.8/10",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
12,lasttimeisaw,"Intrepid heroine, an above-average Hollywood pap",7,17 February 2016,"A romance-comedy retells the story of Cinderella, directed by Andy Tennant (SWEET HOME ALABAMA 2002, HITCH 2005 and FOOL'S GOLD 2008), in an attempt to revamp the fairytale with a historical context, in the early 16th century, France. A beautiful young girl Danielle (Barrymore), who is being treated as a servant by her stepmother, the baroness Rodmilla (Huston) after the sudden death of her father Auguste (Krabbé). Upon a chance meeting with Prince Henry (Scott), a romantic feeling has seized both of them, but Danielle is in her courtier disguise, in a moment of desperation, she uses her dead mother's name to hide her real identity.While running from an arranged marriage from his parents King Francis I (West) and Queen Marie (Parfitt), Henry decides to marry the girl his heart really wants, so Rodmilla has an eye to the main chance to marry off her own daughter Marguerite (Dodds), and she has no qualms to hamper the true love between Danielle and Henry at all cost. The storyline is basically the same with the fairytale, but all the fantasy elements have been entirely trimmed off, no fairy godmother, no pumpkin carriage, even the slipper has no magic, instead, a real historical figure, Leonardo da Vinci (Godfrey) is introduced as the game-changer, with his painting MONA LISA, which was actually purchased by King Francis I.One refreshing upgrade of the story is that Danielle's characteristic has been rendered a modern retouch, she is no longer a damsel in distress, she is the ill-fated Cinderella, but she doesn't need her knight errant to rescue her out of her misery, on the contrary, it is her who saves Henry from a gypsy mob by pluckily carrying him on her shoulder, and near the coda, it is also herself who defeats the Gothic-looking merchant Pierre Le Pieu (O'Brien) even before Henry's arrival, set side by side with Kenneth Branagh's flashier Cinderella (2015), EVERAFTER is unwaveringly innovatory to elevate its heroine out of the cliché and more modest in its art production.So much for the good intention, the script still seems unbalanced, Marguerite's wilful turning against her mother is the work of a sophomoric writing, so is Henry's sudden change of mind, these parts are unfortunately being rushed out without thoughtful polishing. Barrymore's winsome appearance can smoothly erase viewers' memories about her problematic child-star past, and the film does revive her career, at the age of 23, she manages to pull off a second life on the big screen. This movie also marks Dougray Scott's Hollywood breakthrough, but one might argue, his sombre mien doesn't quite fit the role as an unsophisticated prince (maybe Jude Law would be a better casting choice), his Prince Henry is not dewy-eyed enough to believably amazed by Danielle's class-defying viewpoint and her extremely ample vigour for life, and his natural reserves doesn't help either.As always, the evil stepmother is the most delectable part, and who can portray unbearable haughtiness better than the almighty Anjelica Huston? She is absolutely a hoot to watch, period. Melanie Lynskey's Jacqueline, Danielle's other step-sister, is another surprise, she is more defiant towards her mother and more sympathetic to Danielle, and wonderfully throws the last bon mot ""of course not, mother, I'm here just for the food."" in the otherwise bromide-laden ending.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
13,briancham1994,Modern retelling,7,3 June 2020,"This film has the classic Cinderella story but with a modern twist.

14,digitalbeachbum,A better version,7,4 May 2021,"We all know the story about Cinderella but this one takes away the magic and the Disney BS and makes it a more down to Earth story with a more believable set of characters.

15,lisafordeay,A different approach on the classic Cinderella tale on how Cinderella came to be an icon to the world of fairy tales,7,26 April 2015,"The film Ever After is told by an elderly woman who talks to the Brother Grimns and Charles Pennault on Danielle who would soon be an inspiration for their fairy tale Cinderella(which we all grew and love today). But this version of Cinderella isn't like any other Cinderella adaptation.Released in 1998 the film stars Drew Barrymore(sporting a British accent) as a young woman named Danielle who lives with her evil stepmother played by Angelica Huston and her daughters(one of Danielle's stepsisters is nice to her, the other stepsister treats her like dirt). Danielle father you see married a baron (who is Huston's character)and he tragically dies of a heart attack as he was going away on a business trip and he collapsed and died as Danielle and the baron watched in horror.Meanwhile later on in the film Danielle meets a handsome prince named Henry played by Dougray Scott, whom she had no idea was a prince as she threw something at him and she apologized to him.She disguises herself as a countess and meets Henry again as she tries to save a man who is been sold off,and Henry assumes that Danielle is a countess. But will he love Danielle for her real self and not as a countess named Nicole(who is the name of Danielle's deceased mother)?. Overall I really enjoyed this version as well as it had more screen time with Danielle and the prince BUT I have a few issues with it.1. What is Leonardo Di Vinci got to do with Cinderella? Cinderella has a fairy godmother NOT a famous painter.2. Shouldn't Henry assume that the countess was Danielle since he seen her face before?3. The romance between the prince and Danielle was very well done and Danielle is a very headstrong girl who can stand up to herself,but Cinderella wasn't like that at all.Bottom line I must be the only person who prefers Lily James' outtake of Cinderella but I grew up with the tale of a young servant girl who wins the heart of her prince and doesn't meet him until the ball and she loses a glass slipper and doesn't tell the prince who she is or her name.This was a good movie too but like I said I prefer Lily James' version.7/10Kudos though for not having Ever After predicable even though parts of it was as I knew Danielle would be with the prince in the end.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

It does not matter whose version was original, from which country it was told, or who the players were (Prince Henry of France in fact married Catherine de Medici, a member of the Italian nobility, not Drew Barrymore's character.), this movie is pure magic.In this reviewer's opinion, this is the very best of Drew Barrymore's work. This is her greatest role, her greatest portrayal, her best movie. Period. For that fact alone, you should see this attempt, but let me continue.The acting is spot on, the sets and costumes were meticulously designed, the writing involved here was flawless, the directing was pure professionalism, the flow was smooth, the tale was the best-told tale I've seen in years, and the finished product was a masterpiece.I was, and am, enchanted by this film, in every way.

I guess guys would enjoy looking at Drew Barrymore, who is not at her best quoting Thomas Moore's Utopia, but is otherwise sweet.Angelica Huston has the evil step-mother patented, but this one even turns out to have been a victim of a cold mother herself who could have been saved by her love for Cinderella's father if he'd lived longer. Yeah the Prince is a bit bland, but gosh how many movies have I sat through where the female love interest is all visual and little else (The she was the weakest part of ""Braveheart"" for example.) And Barrymore's character shakes the Prince out of bland lethargy into intellectual activism. Interesting that the nasty neighbor with designs on Barrymore actually is the only one who appreciates her spirit; there was a ""Taming of the Shrew implication"" there. There's a jarring closing ersatz Celine Dion song at the end co-written by Dave Stewart and sung by the band Texas.

He of course falls for her, believing her to be a courtesan.Drew Barrymore is no great shakes as a romantic lead, though neither does the support really shine; even though Anjelica Huston relishes her role.

Anyhow, this wonderfully enchanting film stars Drew Barrymore (with a very weird but cute Frenchy-British accent) as the Cinderella character. But she isn't your average push over, this Cinderella kicks major arse and take no prisoners either. She actually rescues her prince at one point as opposed to the usual vice versa we're used to seeing.

21,rannynm,"An exceptionally entertaining film filled with drama, romance, comedy and a stellar cast",9,15 October 2020,"The exceptionally entertaining film Ever After: A Cinderella Story, starring Drew Barrymore, is filled with drama, romance and comedy! The best part is definitely its intriguing plot, which is based on the Cinderella story. I thoroughly enjoy following Danielle (Drew Barrymore) throughout her adventures. The cast is full of strong actors and the costumes are beautifully detailed.We are introduced to the story by an elderly woman who meets with a couple of men, because they seem to have unknowingly written a book about something that she knows actually happened. They call her 'Cinderella,' but the woman knows her as Danielle. The dusty pages of the book open and we are brought into the bright, colorful world of a young girl. That world soon becomes dark and evil when her father dies and she is taken in by the Baroness Rodmilla (Angelica Huston) as a servant. She struggles under the weight of understanding her heart and rebelling against Rodmilla.The most noticeable element in this production is the story. Compared to the original Cinderella stories, this is far better, taking an amazing twist off the traditional plot. While keeping the same ideas of romance and being treated unfairly, we see more realistic events in this film. The acting performances almost equal the incredible plot. Drew Barrymore and Angelica Huston's performances are outstanding, but Megan Dodds (Marguerite), Melanie Lynskey (Jacqueline) and Anna Maguire (young Danielle) are also unforgettable. These actresses make the difference between a good movie and a great movie. Also woven throughout the story are breath-taking costumes. At many points, I just stared at the screen in awe. One example is when Danielle dresses up near the beginning of the film with the help of Gustave (Lee Ingleby). She wears a pressed gown with white lace and some nice shoes. The truly mind-blowing detail is her hair. Bravo to her hairstylists! Not only in this scene, but throughout the entire film, her hair always seems to be perfectly styled. When she is serving Rodmilla and her daughters, she has her hair down, but it is still pretty. Once she goes into the village as a courtier, her hair is braided, styled and commonly topped with an accessory that always matches. Without these fantastic attention to detail, this film would not be what it is.The message becomes clearer as the film develops - work hard, always stay positive and treat others fairly. Danielle goes through a period of grieving, but then she slowly starts to realize that she must move on, even when it means working hard to feed and serve her stepmother and stepsisters as they insult her. She stays positive all the time, which is very important for her apparent destiny to come true. The sympathy we feel for Danielle when her stepmother is cruel to her can all be traced back to treating others fairly. This is the most important message in this film.Ever After: A Cinderella Story is one of the best films I have watched. I give it 4.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 9 to 18, plus adults.Reviewed by Cadence G., KIDS FIRST!",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
22,mike48128,"Drew Barrymore as a "" Tomboy"" Cinderella!",9,14 March 2018,"It is hinted in this version, that The Brothers Grimm ""romanced"" the story and this version is closer to the truth, but it is merely an extremely well-done alternate version, retaining the basic premise, the glass slippers and some pageantry. The slippers are invented by Leonardo Da Vinci, a wizard of a man but certainly not a fairy godmother! So many different ""spins"" on the well-known tale. Drew Barrymore acts more like a tomboy than a fairy princess and the royal family is quite unbelievable, but ""that's those Royals for you"". It borrows a bit from every version of Cinderella that you have ever seen and then drops it on it's ear. There is an evil rich lord who lusts after our heroine and has quite un-pure thoughts. Yet it retains the spunk of the more relaxed versions of ""The Musketeers"". Almost a ""10"" but it misses because it's a bit more violent than I expected. It is a far cry from being a sanitized Disney production. Enough ""swashbuckling"" that older children and adults will like it.

The Stepmother was really a Stepmother and not an overblown characture, The Prince was an a-hole but what man at any point can't be, the fairy god-person was unorthodoxed, and our little Cinderella was FAR from meek!

24,blott2319-1,Fixes the biggest issues with the Cinderella fable,7,2 April 2020,"There are many interpretations and adaptations of the story of Cinderella, but it's never been a fairy tale that I've loved. Ever After is the one exception to that, because this film addresses the biggest problem with the story of Cinderella. This film actually gives some logic to why the prince falls in love with the girl, beyond a pretty dress and some glass shoes. I can accept love at first sight, but to warrant the kind of tireless dedication that it takes to visit every woman in your kingdom trying on shoes, there has to be something more there. Ever After also turns Cinderella into a stronger character who has hopes, dreams, and convictions of her own. One odd choice they made was trying to tie the film all into actual nations, because the story clearly won't stand up to any historical exploration. It also doesn't justify the English accents of the characters, when its supposedly taking place in France.I'll admit there is some cheesy aspects to Ever After. It is loaded with cliché, and is predictable from beginning to end. Also, I admit that Drew Barrymore can grate on the nerves a little bit. She is likeable, but there is some subtlety missing in her performance, and her attempt at an English accent is the worst. That being said, I still get swept up in the charm of Ever After. I am a sucker for a good romance story, and I think this one is solid. I also like the different twist on many of the familiar elements of the Cinderella story. Perhaps most entertaining is the way they replace the fairy godmother. The framing sequence is an odd one, because it's a fictional presentation of someone saying that this was a true story. I suppose that's how they were trying to explain why this is a more grounded and less magical version of the tale, but it is so silly since we know it's not based on any historic events. But, fact or fiction, I find Ever After to be an enjoyable little film despite its flaws.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
25,gbheron,Kick-Ass Cinderella,7,29 April 2000,"Cinderella kicks butt in this feminist retelling of the classic fairy tale. Orphaned as a young girl, Danielle (Cinderella) is raised by her evil stepmother and two stepsisters in rural 16th century France. After a few chance encounters with the crown prince (who falls in love with her), Danielle finds herself on a collision course with her family who have royal designs of their own. Shot on location in France, the dialogue often veers very close to preachy, but knows when to cut the politics and return to the story. And a good story it is, well acted by Drew Barrymore as Danielle, and Angelica Huston as the wicked stepmother. This one is worth the rental.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
26,petra_ste,Your aim would suggest otherwise,5,31 July 2016,"I have a special affection for Disney's classic Cinderella (1950), but I acknowledge its main message is problematic, with a female protagonist passively enduring a lifetime of abuse only to be rescued first by magic, then by marriage. I can understand the purpose of a version with a more proactive heroine. Which is what EverAfter attempted to do... except it's garish, tone-deaf and poorly cast. Looking at director Andy Tennant's uncannily bad resume, it's hardly a surprise.Drew Barrymore is appealing in a girl-next-door kind of way but, with her tomboyish look and feel, she comes across as a teenager playing dress-up. Far worse is Dougray Scott as the prince. Scott is a handsome chap, I guess, but there is something cold, almost reptilian about his glare, which made him ideal as the anti-Cruise villain in Mission Impossible 2 - not so much as a romantic lead. Anjelica Huston at least is better cast as the baleful stepmother.Tennant glues scenes to each other with no regard for build-up or coherency. In a twist worthy of a soap opera, the heroine is sold into slavery (?) to some evil ruffian. Once inside his castle, she grabs a sword and orders him to unchain her. You now expect some kind of narrow escape sequence, evading guards and so on... except, the movie just cuts to her walking out of the castle with a satisfied smirk. Wait, what? Did the evil guy turn to stone? Did he live all alone in that huge fortress? It defies not just logic, but also the basic rules of storytelling; it's grotesquely anticlimactic.Even visually, here's an example of how little thought went into EverAfter. During the final confrontation, the stepmother is dressed in the same shade of deep green as the nice stepsister, while the wicked stepsister wears red. It doesn't make sense! You want to VISUALLY ASSOCIATE the two evil characters and make the good one STAND OUT. It may be a nitpick, but the movie is littered with this kind of sloppy choices.The movie features Leonardo da Vinci as a secondary character. The Italian genius has not been lucky as far as his cinematic appearances are concerned: between this, the Bruce Willis bomb Hudson Hawk, a cretinous potboiler like The Da Vinci Code and Paul W. S. Anderson's The Three Musketeers, it's ironic how a man of such legendary intelligence tends to be referenced only by stupid movies. His most enjoyable cameo may be in the comedy Non Ci Resta Che Piangere... where he is portrayed as dumb. Go figure... poor Leonardo.5/10",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
27,perfectbond,Quite moving actually,8,7 September 2003,"I am not usually moved by films in this genre but I was with Ever After. The acting, costumes, cinematography, and writing were all perfect in recreating a fairy tale. The movie was very satisfying. Drew Barrymore is very good at playing this type of role as seen in Never Been Kissed and even The Wedding Singer. She was also backed by a terrific supporting cast. Angelica Huston and the director made the right choice in not playing her character over the top.

A new ingredient was added to this film, such as the presence of the famous Leonardo Da Vinci.The love between Cinderella and the prince was developed during the film and was not the result of a casual meeting in any Royal reception. All actors/actresses acted well, being Anjelica Huston the best, who did a good job in the role of Danielle De Barbarac, she was cruel enough in all occasions and made her role credible.

29,FloatingOpera7,Cinderella: A Historical Romance,10,26 July 2006,"Ever After (1998): Starring Drew Berrymore, Dougray Scott, Angelica Houston, Megan Dodds, Melanie Lynskey, Jeroen Krabbe, Richard O'Brien, Judy Parfitt, Patrick Godfrey, Timothy West, Judy Parfitt, Lee Inbleby, Kate Lansbury, Walter Sparrow, Jeanne Moreau, Peter Gunn, Toby Jones, Joerg Stadler, Andy Henderson, Al Hunter Ashton, Christian Marc, Elvira Stevenson, Ursula Jones, Alex Pooley, John Walters, Janet Henfrey, Rupam Maxwell, Jean-Piere Mazieres....Director Andy Tennant... Screenplay Susannah Grant, Rick Parks.""Whether they lived happily ever after is not the point, gentlemen, the point is ... they lived."" Based on the 1729 French novella by Charles Perrault (who wrote dozens of the fairy tales we all grew up hearing as children- Sleeping Beauty, Beauty and the Beast, etc), this is a 1998 film by director Andy Tennant who turns the familiar Cinderella story into a lush, Renaissance Era historical romance. What makes this particular Cinderella stand out is that it's structure never succumbs to the dullness of the repetitive formula of the other well-known Cinderellas. The Cinderella in this story is a beautiful Baroness painted by Leonardo Da Vinci during 1500's France. Her great grand-daughter, an old Countess, has possession of the painting which she happily shows off to her guests and proceeds to tell them the story of the ""real life"" historic Cindrella. This is a superb film, and deceptive at first, considering the fact that ""Ever After"", at face value and judging from the posters and previews back in the late 90's looked to be a fantasy/escapist bore starring a costume-clad Drew Berrymore and Angelica Houston who were doing roles that were beneath them. Far from it. Screenwriters Susannah Grant and Richard Parks did a marvelous job of adapting a classic fairy tale into a well-written historical film set in rural, Renaissance France with strong, well-developed characters and a substantial plot. Drew Berrymore stars as Danielle De Barbarac, the unloved daughter of her ""wicked stepmother"" Baroness Rodmilla De Ghent (Angelica Houston), who hopes to groom her own daughters Marguerite and Jacqueline (Megan Dodds and Melanie Linskey). The familiar Cinderella story we all know does not kick in until much later in the film, in fact, toward the end of the film. Before that we are treated to a great female character - she's highly independent, democratic, intelligent and an irrepressible country girl, friends with the farm-hands and local village folk, a young lady, who, despite ill treatment by her stepmother, poses as an inner nobility. She manipulates scenes in order to teach feudal Prince Henry (Dougray Scott) lessons in the real world and how the other half lives. The two of them, despite some initial antagonism, fall in love long before she goes to the ball, making this a very realistic, human love story stripped of all the Disney and Rodgers and Hammerstein's gloss. A greater chemistry between Cinderella and her Prince you'd be hard-pressed to find, especially because the other versions fall flat on realistic romantic chemistry. Barrymore and Scott's chemistry is terrific on this film. The cinematography by Andrew Dunn is sumptuous. You can get lost in the vistas of great forests, rural towns and marketplaces, as well as old châteaux. The costumes are true to what people of their class wore in the Renassiance. Even Leonardo Da Vinci is a prominent character in the story, making this Cinderella a different animal than the other versions, certainly more thought-provoking. There is a very literary feel to all of this, as if Cinderella is more than just a fairy tale and it feels as if the screenplay were being lifted from a historical romance novel. The music by George Fenton is appropriately Baroque, romantic and airy. The actors are delivering strong performances, taking themselves as seriously as Oscar hopeful stars, despite the fact that sometimes the dialog and script suffers from a Shakespearean and old-fashioned tone. Angelica Houston delivers her usual good performance. As the Stepmother, she is deliciously wicked. While the film never strays from the heart of the Cinderella romance, which by modern feminist standards is about a woman who waits passively for her Prince Charming and for life to improve, this is a story that is balanced by a strong, feminist, forward-thinking, modern Cinderella who needs no rescuing and makes things happen for herself using her intelligence, skills and personal merit. It was the 90's after all, a time when women's roles on film were neither weak or sexist. This is a gorgeous and very well-made movie and I highly urge for parents to get their children, especially girls, who are drowning with lack of good female role models. A remarkable movie sure to delight and enthrall everyone, young and old.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
30,emm,A nicely revamped variation of the old fairy tale that comes only once upon a time.,7,29 April 1999,"EVER AFTER isn't exactly the same old ""Cinderella"" that has been copied off numerous times in the media. This is a refreshing charm at telling the old children's tale in updated flavor, and it sure is crafty. You knew what went on in ""Cinderella"" before, so now this becomes a remake of the events that suddenly turn irreverent. Still, why not be satisfied over something new and improved? The fine acting is what makes this a wholesome delight, even for the high school crowd. Drew Barrymore leads the 90s feminist revolution in what is one of her top performances as ""Danielle"" (not Cinderella, although her character is identical). Certainly, her role is a very genuine effort compared to her childhood years and independent movie days. Girls would be cheering for Barrymore in giving her stepsister the black eye, and carrying the handsome prince on back; feminism pays off quite a good sum. Anjelica Huston is also wonderful as the stepmother, and well casted. It's not very harmless except for some intense swordplay and lost clothing from princess Barrymore, but its screenplay follows a vintage classic movie. The highest point is what we all come to know and love: a girl meets boy spectacle that leads to (almost) a very different twist of a conclusion. Young children won't get the true meaning of this one, as it is the opposite. Send them a copy of the Disney movie instead. Otherwise, a magically adolescent fairy tale that lives happily ever after.

The characters are all real human beings and there is no fairy godmother nor a carriage and horses made from a pumpkin and mice nor is the glass slipper used by the prince to find his true love.Indeed, this movie takes place in mid-16th century France, and the prince is expected by his parents to marry a Spanish princess for political purposes, and the movie does bring up the concept of social classes and obligations. Cinderella herself is strong and rebellious, but society and family restrict her as much as everybody else. Even the wicked stepmother is a product of her era-and she is subtle rather than shrill and over-the-top in her villainy.The movie is not entirely realistic-Leonardo Da Vince is present as a court painter, and criminals were sent to the Americas, probably not done in that era.

Andy Tennant did a great job of directing this picture. The acting was well done all around. I liked the bickering in the bittersweet relationship of the King and Queen, and I loved the idea of only one bad step-sister.

Take as an example ""The Deep End of the Ocean"". It is a beautiful and emotional film, and I really liked it. However, I don't know if I would feel the same thing if I had seen it on the movies. In my view, it would be rather slow and boring. I can say the same thing about ""Ever After"". It is a sweet, charming picture, and I thought it was pretty good. I had a great time watching it on the cable TV, but... somehow it belongs to the small screen. The main reasons for that are its predictability and the 'Sunday-afternoon-matinee' way it was done. Who doesn't know the story of Cinderella? And who doesn't love it? It is one of the most beautiful and known fairy tales of all times, and it enchants children till our days. Director Andy Tennant doesn't dare very much, but somehow he does the right thing. It is a family picture, for all ages, so it is predictable for a reason. And it is done the way I said for the same reason. ""Ever After"" was made for people to have fun, and it does this job very well.So if you are not looking for something intellectual, as a Shakespeare adaptation, give a chance to ""Ever After"". It is cute, sweet, fun, romantic and quite touching. It is a pretty good film and, even not being such a stunning movie as Andy Tennant last direction job, ""Anna and the King"" (which I loved), is a worth seeing for all ages.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

By replacing the fairy godmother with Leonardo da Vinci, of all people, the writers merely substituted one fairy tale for another.  And it's hard to imagine Danielle -- who is such a republican (small ""r"") that she sounds like an anarchist in a couple of places -- living happily ever after with any absolute monarch, even a love-struck sap like Henry.  But none of this is important.  LOVE that Drew Barrymore.  Not even Anjelica Huston, who is an actor's actor, can be convincingly mean to her.  As the wicked stepmother she says the lines, but radiates affection for Barrymore almost in spite of herself whenever they're in the shot together.  In the end, the movie becomes a frame for Barrymore's portrait of the sweet and long-suffering Danielle, and if you don't want to hug her you need your heart examined.

41,ScottAmundsen,Great Addition to the Fairy Tale Genre,10,24 July 2013,"I am usually wary of films based on fairy tales; with the exception of the brilliant animated classics of the Disney studio and the occasional musical (Rodgers and Hammerstein's version of this very story), most of them are boring at best and dreadful at worst. So it was a delightful surprise to experience EVER AFTER: A Cinderella STORY, a film that brings a refreshingly feminist sensibility to the main character without violating the fantasy.We all know the story: Cinderella (named Danielle here and beautifully played by Drew Barrymore) lives with her nasty stepmother (Angelica Huston, looking like a cobra) and her two stepsisters, Marguerite (Megan Dodds) and Jacqueline (Melanie Lynskey). Her father is dead, and her stepmother has relegated her to the status of household servant. Her stepsisters are not equally nasty: Marguerite is as bitchy and spoiled as her mother, but Jacqueline is made of softer stuff and tries to make Danielle's life easier, though she isn't strong enough to actually defy her terrifying mother (at least not until the end of the picture).Of course, the core of the film is the romance between Danielle and Prince Henry (Dougray Scott); when they first meet she quotes from Sir Thomas More's UTOPIA, one of the few possessions of her father's that she has left; the prince is not only struck by her beauty, but fascinated that a ""commoner"" (and a woman at that, though this is left unsaid) can quote from great literature. Danielle hides her identity from the prince; when he asks her name she gives him the name of her deceased mother.I don't need to go into details. A few plot devices have been added, which is fine because this is the sort of tale that was probably passed on from mother to child in an oral tradition long before anyone put pen to paper. Drew Barrymore's Cinderella is not only breathtakingly lovely, she's fiercely intelligent and possessed of an iron will. Prince Henry is a refreshingly real character; in his first encounter with Danielle he reveals his contempt for ""commoners"" and is sharply instructed by Danielle, which does not make him angry but only fascinates him the more. The rest is mostly intact: the ball, the Prince's discovery of Danielle's true identity, and his almost-marriage to a most unwilling Spanish princess in what is easily the funniest scene in the whole film.The cast is uniformly magnificent, though the accents are a bit variable. Aside from Huston, Barrymore, and Megan Dodds, all of the principal actors are some form of British (Dougray Scott is Scottish and was trained in Wales and Melanie Lynskey is from New Zealand). Of the Americans in the cast, Megan Dodds pulls off the English accent the best; in fact I was quite surprised to learn she was born in California. Barrymore's accent is adequate; the passion she brings to the role more than makes up for minuscule patterns of speech. Huston's accent is more Upper West Side NY aristocracy than anything else, but again, the actress throws herself into the role with a gusto that makes the rest easy to overlook.Also on hand is one of my favorite English character actresses, Judy Parfitt (DOLORES CLAIBORNE), who plays the Queen of France as a delightfully human woman, who loves her son and wants only the best for him, and also loves her husband enough that she can laugh and tease him, but when necessary she becomes regal, icy, and every inch the Queen, whom one can imagine yelling ""OFF WITH HIS/HER HEAD!!""This sort of film is risky territory, because the tales we remember from childhood often remain vivid in our minds and it's a rare film that can take whatever liberties the writers and director take and still be pleasing. This one is probably one of the best; it is beautifully written, acted, and photographed, the costumes are sumptuous, and the writers cleverly inject enough comic relief to keep the mood light.As romances go this one hits a home run.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

It is Danielle's strength of character; ability and desire to act decisively and to be consistently honest that brings her from a servant/slave of a cold-hearted step mother, to queen. Although this story was modeled on the fairy tale Cinderella, I do not feel that that handicaps or otherwise restrains the movie. Rather, this may be the best feature-length movie based on that fairy tale. Beforehand, I'd only seen Drew in The Wedding Singer (good movie, but she is not given a dynamic part like in Ever After) and Never Been Kissed (I loathe that movie, because, as in The Wedding Singer, she is trapped in the middle of someone else's plans).

I was ready and willing to cheer and cry for Danielle (the character played by Barrymore) at any time.  I really felt an air of enchantment around the whole movie. Then, I saw it again last night on HBO.  I still enjoyed myself, but I noticed flaws, as well.  The air of enchantment was largely gone, and it was more obvious how improbable the story line was.  I should have known that before, but because I was held in thrall the last time I saw it, I didn't notice.  Now, I wasn't held in thrall as much.  I did notice, in addition to the countryside, the sumptuous sets, which hadn't caught my attention as much before.

Of all fairy tales, Cinderella has always been down at the bottom with my least favorite ones. The incredible level of sexism disgusted me. And then I saw this movie. I didn't want to see it. I love Drew Barrymore, and have been a supporter of hers since I was old enough to understand her situation. She was, I believe, 16 the first time I heard her entire story. That admiration has only grown over the last 8 years. But the first thing I thought of when I read the synopsis of ""Ever After"" was ""what a lot of hokum."" My friends, who had already seen it and promised me it was great even though they knew I hated the story of Cinderella, forced me, kicking and screaming, into the theater. And I absolutely loved it. Everything about it is magical, even without (thank God) a fairy godmother. That is not to say it's perfect, but its earnest charm won me over. I love the changes they made, like the step-sisters not being ugly and Danielle being smart and free-thinking. This is one movie that everyone seemed to not have good expectations for, yet almost everyone I know of who has seen it loved it. I think that says something. Anybody who didn't like it is certainly free to have their own opinion, of course, but I think they must be crazy. One thing I didn't like was the beginning of the video. (Yes, I ran out and bought it.) The ""Never Been Kissed"" trailer is fitting, but what the heck is up with the volunteer pitch? I could overlook that, even if it was odd, because it at least advocated something good. But I'm completely clueless about the ""Party of Five"" thing. I had this sudden odd feeling I'd stepped into some slightly off-kilter alternate universe for a second when I was watching it. (Shrug) Probably it was just me.

Drew Barrymore's performance was good, Anjelica Huston was the perfect stepmother and Dougray Scott was an eligible Prince Charming. Plus, it was quite refreshing to see no Fairy Godmother or magic pumpkins around and I also liked the fact that there was some prevention (due to Melanie Lynskey's portrayal of the younger stepsister Jaqueline) from their being too much hostility towards Danielle (Cinderella).

53,rondine,A wonderfully surprising movie that was both charming and heart-wrenching.,8,6 September 1999,"When my sister-in-law suggested we rent & watch this movie, I admit that I didn't want to see it. And even though I noticed plastic cups on the table and bad English accents in what was supposed to be set in France, I TOTALLY enjoyed this movie. It is true that making it more into a real story w/out a magical fairy godmother, but instead an intelligent DaVinci, just added more substance to the story itself. The character of Danielle (Cinderella) was even more engrossing than the original tale. Instead of being this inexplicable, wonderful, saintly human being, she is a all too human and someone that's easier to relate to. This is a movie for all ages. Even my husband really liked it and he's an action movie fan. The costumes were beautiful and the music was enchanting. People can find fault with anything, but sometimes it's better to enjoy something for what it is... a good story.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

Yes; this movie is chock full of anachronisms, although I'll paraphrase David Drake in saying that this film was intended for modern-day English speaking audiences, and so it ought not be astonishing that the characters neither affect faux French accents nor speak bastardized Ren Faire ""forsoothly"" language. No; this movie doesn't have a lot to offer the gritty crowd who'd be happier watching Sin City. Yes; it's a romance-novel chick flick, basically.Once you get past the elements the movie just was never going to have and which no one ought to have expected, it's quite pleasant. Barrymore is a sweet, serene presence, Huston is always-understated, never overacting as the villain, and you'd have to be a hardcore curmudgeon not to appreciate their interaction.

57,zerogirl42,A Charming Twist on Cinderella,9,30 January 2007,"Ever After is a wonderful tale about the fictional ""true"" inspiration for Cinderella.It opens with The Brothers Grimm approaching a very wealthy, old woman to find out what Cinderella is really about. The lady tells the tale of her grandmother, Danielle, a strong-willed girl placed in terrible circumstances.Danielle isn't a damsel in distress like in typical fairy tales. She's determined to take charge of her life and isn't afraid to ask for help along the way. Danielle has a Scarlett O'Hara style of determination to save her home and take care of the people she cares about.I usually don't enjoy Drew Barrymore, but she is quite delightful as Danielle. There are lots of laughs and some very cruel moments doled out by an evil stepsister and mother played by Anjelica Houston.The costumes are beautiful and the characters are fun and interesting. There's even the appearance of da Vinci with his crazy contraptions.I recommend Ever After for romantics. I'm an adult and I very much enjoy the film. I find it to be good to show to the teenage girls in my family. It's also nice to have play in the background when I have girlfriends over and we work on sewing projects together.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

Well, if you are a fan of comedy or epics in particular, give it a try. It's not in the same comedic vein as ""Shrek"" -- the humour in this film is much more subtle (check the colour of the veils worn by Rodmilla & Marguerite at the Prince's wedding, for example). Nor is it a timeless plea for social justice like ""Cry Freedom"". But it has the basic elements of both. And it's visually pleasant (it's not just New Zealand that has great scenery), & it's anchored by Drew Barrymore, who is surprisingly cute with an (occasionally laboured) English accent, and Dougray Scott, who wins the ultimate accolade from me - I didn't recognise him till I saw the credits at the end of the film.Yes, it's a romance.

61,trixie-k-88,The best version of Cinderella there is,10,5 March 2012,"How can someone take the most over told fairy tale of all time and make it into an interesting, new movie? Well, I don't know, but the creators of Ever After did it! There's no point in going over the plot, as everyone knows it. But somehow Ever After gives the age old characters a soul, a purpose, and in a way, makes them real. Danielle(Cinderella) is played beautifully by Drew Barrymore. Danielle is a strong, intelligent, brave young woman with a mind of her own. She is passionate about books, economic justice and taking pride in a day's work. This film takes a strong feminist stand on the story, making Danielle an independent woman who truly doesn't ""need"" a man. In recent years this has been done so much with fairy tales that it comes off as contrived, annoying andfalse. But in Ever After the viewer doesn't feel like the writers just had angry feminists breathing down their necks; instead it gives Danielle's personality purpose. It is established early on that her father instilled the values of reading, hard work, and self-reliance. This makes Danielle a truly believable character, instead of just a feminist take on a helpless ""damsel"". It also gives a more human take on the ""evil"" stepmother, Rodmilla (Anjelica Houston). Danielle and her stepmother are with her father when he dies, and he tells only Danielle he loves her. It's clear that Rodmilla is overcome with jealousy and feels trapped in the less than noble life her husband left for her. Along with that, only one of the stepsisters, Marguerite (Megan Dodds)is cruel to Danielle. While the favored Marguerite bullies Danielle every chance she gets, the shy and less attractive Jacqueline (Melanie Lynskey) sympathizes with and even sometimes stands up for her. As for the prince—who is given the name of Henry and played by Dougray Scott, he is not very charming at all. If anything, Henry is what one would expect a prince to be, spoiled,arrogant, and frustrated. As for the fairy Godmother, she is replaced by Leonardo DaVinci! While it sounds ridiculous at first, this works very well with the rest of the story. Danielle's relationship with the prince is also much more realistic. They do not meet for the first time at the ball, but interact and date several times before. This allows the characters to have a much meatier romance based on getting to know each other, rather than a shallow love at first sight. Henry's reaction to finding out Danielle is a servant also seems much more true to life. Instead of looking past her humble beginnings and lies, he is furious and forces her away from the castle. Only after DaVinci talks sense into Henry does he seek Danielle out again for a reconciliation and their ""happily ever after"".When you know the story of Cinderella in and out, it is refreshing and surprising when someone actually finds a new and engaging way to tell it. Ever After does just that, by giving depth to its characters and making the entire situation sound realistic. This is my favorite version of Cinderella, and the kind of movie you can watch over and over again.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
62,Tunica,Fun if uneven,7,6 March 1999,"This variation of the fairy tale is quite entertaining. A lot of thought and effort seems to have gone into it. The main detraction, to me, was some obvious plot twisting, perhaps caused by the writers wanting both to be original and to be faithful to the original fairy tale. The prolog and the ending are needless and seem tacked on, as none of the actors in those scenes are otherwise in the movie.I know this is a fantasy, but for anyone who is interested in history, Leonardo Di Vinci could not have been present as shown in the story, as he would have been dead for century at least.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

65,fierypoeticgirl,"""This movie had many inconsistencies but well worth the watch""",10,29 October 2007,"Even though this movie had many inconsistencies, I felt the acting was priceless. Everyone was credible. It is a silly tale, but every once in a while, people need to be reminded to look for what's inside a person (not outside) and not, as they say in the movie, define someone as what they are but rather who they are. As an English teacher, I'm very disappointed in Drew Barrymore's inability to recognize that the phrase, ""I could care less,"" (while she's flying the kite) is incorrect. As most English majors or minors know, to say ""I could care less,"" is incorrect usage of our priceless English language. Almost everyone makes this mistake and I'm sick of it!! Learn from this, Drew! The proper phrase is, ""I COULD NOT care less!"" In other words, if she cared less, then she would care less about something else! Most people, no matter how bright they are, will continue to misuse this phrase. Oh, well. The movie was entertaining. The best part is when Danielle picks Henry up and carries him off instead of vice-versa. I loved the humor in that. Anjelica, as always, is an astounding actress. I suppose she can do any role. Oh, and I want to thank that ONE person who did not agree with me....thanks....you're obviously lacking in the English language as well. lol.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

67,artemis_5,Sweet and Romantic Retelling of Cinderella,8,14 April 2006,"Usually when a director tries to remake a beloved story, he or she ends up butchering it. Just think of all of the television adaptations of fairy tales that fall short of their intended mark. This story, however, succeeds in being clever and sweet, while still maintaining the basic elements of the classic story. There is an evil stepmother who works the main character to the bone, evil stepsisters (or at least one evil stepsister), a prince who is looking for a wife, our heroine posing as nobility to win the prince's heart, and a glass slipper. Only, instead of a fairy godmother, we have Leonardo da Vinci.The actors are interesting, the dialogue funny and touching. True Dougray Scott may be a little too mature to play the immature prince, but he is so wonderful that you forget his age. Drew Barrymore is delightful, and is brilliant when it comes to humor. Angelica Huston and Megan Dodds are deliciously evil, and Melanie Lynskey is well-cast as the sweeter and less glamorous of the stepsisters.In short, this film would make a wonderful addition to your family's film collection, and would make a particularly nice gift for a young girl.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

69,bmbdsm,Beautiful from the first frame to the last...,10,30 April 2012,"Is there a fairy tale better known in the world than Cinderella? So many adaptations have been done (Disney, Rodgers and Hammerstein, etc.), and this is one of the finest versions out there. The Grande Dame, disappointed with the Brothers Grimm's telling, invites them to her home, and she tells them the 'real' story: a feisty young woman, trying to rescue a house servant while in disguise, attracts the attention of the prince and falls in love with him. Meanwhile, her wicked stepmother schemes to get her eldest daughter wed to the prince.What makes this film work is the performance of Drew Barrymore (probably her best performance, IMO). She can make you laugh, cry, and cheer. She is spirited without being over-dramatic. She should have been nominated for an Oscar. Angelica Huston plays an extremely nasty stepmother superbly. Dougray Scott is well-matched with Barrymore, his Prince showing a spirit similar to Drew's Cinderella. Megan Dodds is also loathsome as the eldest stepsister. My favorite aspect of the film is George Fenton's exquisite musical score, which helps add emotion to the scenes. Cinematographer Andrew Dunn's wide compositions beautifully showcases the location filming of the French countryside. Beautiful sets and costumes also contribute to this film's success. I could go on and on about this film, but I am limited in review space. If you haven't seen it, do. You won't be disappointed. 10/10. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
70,cathyyoung1,"Two excellent actresses stuck in a mediocre ""empowerment"" fable",5,5 June 2000,"I have absolutely no problem with a revisionist, ""feminist"" retelling of the Cinderella story in which the heroine is a more assertive and self-reliant character -- as long as it's well done.  The problem is that ""well done"" is not a phrase I would use with regard to ""Ever After.""  I suppose it's an OK movie if you're a 13-year-old girl, but it is an insult to the intelligence of any adult viewer, male or female.The movie is ALMOST worth seeing for the wonderful performances of the radiant Drew Barrymore as Danielle (the Cinderella character) and the deliciously wicked Anjelica Huston as the stepmother, Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent.  (Then again, I saw it on cable and didn't even pay the price of the rental.)  But these fine talents are wasted by an inane script with banal dialogue, characters who are both improbable and trite, and absolutely no sense of historical reality.I understand, of course, that this is not a historical film and is based on a fairy tale.  Yet the filmmakers chose to move it to a concrete setting in 16th Century France, and to introduce such real-life characters as King Francois I and Leonardo da Vinci.  If they do that, they should make at least a minimal effort to strive for some historical accuracy.  Yet the royal couple behaves more like modern upper-middle-class American parents; what we get here is a family with all the glamour of royalty and none of its class prejudices.  There's also a lot of confusion about the heroine's social status.  She is repeatedly described as a commoner, yet her name is ""Danielle de Barberac""; the ""de"" is generally a signifier of nobility.  In fact, normally under the laws of that time, if the Baroness had married a commoner, she would have assumed her husband's status and become a commoner herself (and if Danielle was a commoner, so was her father).I don't mind Cinderella being reinvented as feisty, independent or educated. However, when she is turned into an intellectual, a champion of social justice, AND an amateur athlete and swordwoman all wrapped into one ... well, that's a bit much.*** SPOILERS AHEAD***I can accept the scene where Danielle rescues Prince Henry from the gypsies by hoisting him on her back and walking off (after the gypsy leader promises that she can leave with anything she can carry).  In fact, I don't know if the filmmakers knew this but this scene resembles an allegedly true story from the Middle Ages when a city was under siege by an enemy force, and as part of the terms of surrender, the leader of the enemy forces promised to let all the women leave town, taking away anything they could carry.  The women walked out of the city carrying their husbands on their backs.On the other hand, the scene where Danielle gets away from the evil aristocrat to whom the stepmother has sold her as a slave is simply laughable.  She holds a rapier to his throat, forces him to hand over the key to the shackles he has put on her, and simply walks out of his castle free as a bird.  How ridiculous.  The moment the rapier wasn't at his throat anymore, he would have simply either run after her, tackled her and thrown her to the ground, or called his servants who would have grabbed her.  I guess it was so important to make sure that she wasn't rescued by the prince but rescued herself that reality could fall completely by the wayside.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

It is while she is trying to help a family servant that she catches the eye and fancy of Prince Henry played by the dashing Dougray Scott.How Cinderella overcomes the schemes and intrigues of her stepmother and older stepsister is as satisfying as can be.

But...somebody needed to wave a magic wand in the production studio to make the story ""flow better"" in my opinion. I really did like how they weaved Leonardo Da Vinci into the story, and the costumes were gorgeous! The acting was fantastic, especially Barrymore and Huston, despite a rather trite and choppy script. The story fell flat...and even dragged in parts. There was no transition between scenes...they kind of jumped from one scene to another, and it got confusing after a bit.However, just like the classic fairy tale, Danielle (Drew Barrymore) wins the heart and hand of her prince, and they live happily ever after.In short: It's no LORD OF THE RINGS.

74,JaysonT,See it for Anjelica Huston,6,22 October 2006,"""Ever After: A Cinderella Story"" is by no means a contemporary classic. It doesn't even fall under the category of a great contemporary romance. However, it does contain a wonderfully nasty and funny performance from Anjelica Huston.Drew Barrymore plays Danielle, the ""Cinderella"" of the story. Right off hand I felt the filmmakers could have chosen a better actress. Barrymore is just okay, and never has impressed me very much in her film career (her best performances remain ""E.T."", ""Mad Love"" and ""Riding In Cars With Boys""). Also, while she may fall under the Cute department, she is not gorgeous, and I always presumed Cinderella had to be fine. That may sound more like the male ego swarming out of me, but for two hours I'd rather see Denise Richards prancing around in slave rags then Drew Barrymore.But I digress. Danielle's father marries Huston in the beginning of the film, but then suffers a heart attack. Because his last words are to Barrymore and not Huston, Huston turns her into a servant. She will now live to serve and obey Huston and her two daughters. As time passes, we enter their lives and it is here that the humor of the movie is at it's best. Huston is given some very cruel and witty lines to throw at Barrymore when she is serving them breakfast, including ""Some people read because they cannot think for themselves"". And even gets a dis to her own ""plumper"" daughter: ""Don't speak unless you can IMPROVE the silence!"" Hilarious. It is the comedic timing of Huston (and those great eyes) that bring ""Ever After"" to a slightly higher level.The whole movie takes place in France, even though everyone walks around speaking in British accents. And since this movie released in 1998, it's given a feminist spin to it- Danielle isn't some gawking idiot, but actually someone who (gasp) loves to read. She also disguises herself as a Countess to help free some slaves that once worked for Huston, and here encounters the Prince. So it's a whole 'Pretend you're wealthy even though you're poor' routine.We all know eventually Danielle will win the Prince's hand, though I rather enjoyed how it's handled- Huston and her 'horrible' daughter are given a great punishment from the King and Queen, and Danielle actually rescues herself from captivity before the Prince asks for her hand in marriage. Along the way we're treated to mushy love scenes between Danielle and the Prince, and then funny parts when Huston comes in (She says ""How dare you!"" a lot, but its bearable).",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
75,Mookie-21,"Surprisingly good, but too long!",8,14 May 1999,"We watched this movie in English, as we had just finished a BIG EXAM, and I was expecting a major bomb..I was pleasantly surprised to find that Ever After was good. Drew Barrymore was very believable in her own fairy tale way, and she definitely can do the Cinderella thing well. This is probably the best role she's taken in a while. Anjelica Houston is very very good too. Most of the performances were very good. My only complaint is that the film is too long. This is a tale that does not require so much build up. We already know five minutes into the movie that Drew's stepmom will be evil, and yet the film goes with that for an hour. Also, the last six scenes just dragged..they were necessary, but too much build up made them feel draggy. Excellent costumes and cinematography, though. 3 out of 4",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
76,davidkennedy-91087,Smart and Moving Cinderella Retelling,9,27 October 2020,"Cinderella has been a story that's been told and re-told a million times over by this point with every storyteller struggling to put their own unique stamp on it to make it worthy of being re-told in the first place. Many of these have worked well and become favorites for generations of children and their families, but few have been as smart, down to earth and nuanced as Ever After. It's a film that deletes any mention of magic or fairy godmothers and has its heroine attend the big royal ball due to her own smarts and a little help from the people she's supported over the years.Drew Barrymore plays Danielle, a young woman who's been cast aside by her stepfamily and made to work as a servant in their home ever since her father died. Her stepmother, Rodmilla (Anjelica Houston), is obsessed with upper mobility and wants her beautiful daughter Margueritte to nab a prince. What she doesn't expect is for Danielle to happen upon this prince one day and strike up a relationship with him all the while pretending to be her dead mother. As they grow closer, Danielle must figure out if she has the courage to reveal her true self to the prince, free herself from the shackles of her stepfamily, and live happily ever after.Even the stepfamily, while still wicked, are given much more dimension here and more realistic motivations. Rodmilla is motivated by her own self-preservation and not by just being evil for evil's sake. Houston is especially good in a scene where she allows herself to show a little vulnerability to Danielle and we see that her life didn't turn out the way she'd planned.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

A bit boring and depressing for me to watch.I'm also find these sorts of butt-kicking but intelligent and day-dreamy feminist heroines to be very annoying. I find it hard to believe that a heroine whom we are supposed to believe is capable of taking care of herself would put up with so much **** in the movie by her stepfamily than she did. If this girl is capable of kicking a guy's butt near the end of the movie then this same girl should've been capable of kicking her stepfamily to the curb...but then again, we wouldn't have the Cinderella story that is the whole point of this film.I absolutely hated Prince Henry and it's hard to believe that anyone could fall for him (or that he could suddenly have a change of heart in a split second). And yeah there is the issue of characters that are supposed to be French but have English accents, but when you're making a film targeted toward teenage girls, I guess these filmmakers thought they could get away with just about anything.As for me I found this interpretation of Cinderella to be so boring and lifeless I couldn't care less.

The search for the foot fitting the lost shoe, which is a central element in the original, was cruelly reduced to a near-sexual ritual. The persons are set in actual countries, not magic kingdoms, and the whole atmosphere is clearly not fairytale-ish (There is even cement between the bricks!). The introduction of Leonardo da Vinci as the ""newcomer"", a commoner by birth who - as he is a genius - has the power to change traditions is completely idiotic. Why? Hey, this is a fairytale! There are no real persons by definition! However, kids will love it, if they have not been read the original story. It's the same as in ""Die unendliche Geschichte"" (1984). Great filming, but a very, very bad adaption from the book. Hence, the actors do a very good job, especially Drew Barrymore, Anjelica Huston, Megan Dodds (who plays as if born and raised to that part) and Melanie Lynskey. Well, watch it, anyway - this is just my opinion.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
80,greenie,"Enjoyable, but some real plot holes",7,29 May 1999,"An overall enjoyable flick. When in the theatres this one definitely suffered from being branded as a ""chick flick"" but instead does well to replace all the sticky sap of any Julia Roberts or Meg Ryan movie with a strong-willed, likable lead character.Angelica Houston does quite a nasty turn as a real bitch of a stepmother, and other supporting roles are played admirably. DaVinci was played as it should have been, and wasn't portrayed as the typical crazy coot - cum - genious seen in most of such characterizations (although he was horribly misplaced in time, see below). The French King was a bit too oafish for my tastes.Location filming and costumes were fantastic, and the photography of the film adequate enough to allow for a few postcard sequences. Otherwise, direction was pretty much straightforward.There were some heavy plot holes that distracted from the movie however, namely the lack of reasons that Danielle (Barrymore) was suddenly forced into a life of servitude and the utter disappearance of her royal lineage.Personally, I also had some trouble getting around a few of the anachronisms; the mention of ""a recent war,"" the presence of DaVinci, the appearance of the Brothers Grimm, and references to Thomas Moore all in the same movie and time period was well, a bit disturbing.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
81,Burgundy,Wonderful!,9,9 March 1999,"To put it simply, I loved it. No, the accents weren't always right, it didn't have awesome special effects, and it's not going to win any awards, but it's good. If you're looking for the usual Cinderella story (The Fairy Godmother, the pumpkin, the magic) you're not going to find it. What you will find is a fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. It reminds me (and I've found I'm not alone) of one of my other favorite movies, ""The Princess Bride"" It has the same appeal for many different kinds of people. (though not as much guy-appeal as Princess Bride, since there's not long sword-fights) But Ever After is very realistic, compared to both Princess Bride and the usual Cinderella. Like I said, there's no magic, and the relationship between Danielle and Prince Henry develops over time, it's not the silly, unrealistic love-at-first-sight story in the usual version. And Danielle isn't a little wimp everyone can push around. As a teenaged girl I loved that, and I think she's good role model for littler girls used to a very different version of Cinderella. Now for the cast. Drew Barrymore as Danielle is excellent, of course. Dougray Scott is good as a deeper, more complicated Prince than we're used to. Anjelica Huston was the perfect stepmother, showing us a human side for a small part of the movie. Patrick Godfrey was hilarious. Okay, it's not a realistic view of Da Vinci, but that shot for the ""It looks like rain"" scene was probably the funniest part of the movie. And I liked Gustave. Maybe I just have a strange fixation with adorable skinny guys, (Matthew Broderick as Phillipe in LadyHawke is another example) but I'd like to see him again.I really liked the fact that while it's a movie adults can like and unmistakably a love story, there's very few swear words and no sex scenes, making it a movie kids will like too. (even if they don't pick up some of the things that are making the older viewers laugh) Bottom line: If you like fairy-tale stories that are still believable, especially if you're a fan of ""The Princess Bride"", you'll probably like this movie. Watch it with your kids too, especially your daughters. If you nitpick with details or only like Oscar-level dramas, you might wanna skip it.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

At first I thought to myself this is gonna be the same experience, which was always a good watch with every other Cinderella adaptation by the way, but I was wrong.

85,andyman618,Excellent retelling of a classic tale,8,26 August 2003,"Being the father of a nine-year-old girl, I expect I have to face the fact that I'll be watching a lot of fantasy romances. It's too bad that most of them won't be as good as Ever After.In this retelling of the Cinderella story, sans magic, Drew Barrymore stars as the downtrodden but feisty stepdaughter of the deliciously evil Anjelica Huston. Sure, there are plot holes, and problems with logic (what's the French court doing out in the countryside, anyway?), but who cares? Ever After overcomes any objection I might otherwise have had with charm, sweetness, and heart.Effortless direction, sterling performances and a lush score help to breathe life into an old story. But the real star here is the writing. It takes skill to turn such a well-known tale into something fresh and new. The idea of having the visiting Leonardo da Vinci (played to perfection by Patrick Godfrey) serve as the fairy godmother was brilliant, and the denouement, where Huston's evil stepmother is brought low, is wonderfully done.The only possible sour notes in this film are Dougray Scott as a rather flat prince, and Megan Dodds who, as the wicked stepsister was way, way over the top.8/10",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
86,shahmatt,Good show!,9,30 March 2004,"First of all, just a small correction to a comment made by someone earlier. Cinderella was called that because she used to play with the cinders in the fire. Her real name was not mentioned in the fairy tale so it could have very well been 'Danielle'.Anyway! good reproduction of the fairy tale. Great acting! Superb costume work. Awesome and realistic atmosphere with no hints of rock music, as was heard in 'a knight's tale'. The characters were well done: The King looked really like a king, the Queen looked like a queen, the stepmother like the stepmother in the story and Cinderella looked like..well.. ""Cinderella"". Imagining them that way was quite easy.Anyway! the bottom line is that though the movie is merely a fairy tale, it is worth watching. The dialogue is mot juste, and some of the scenes are very well done and not to be missed. Look out for the part where the dance begins at the ball. The coordinated dancing in a circle at the center of the dance floor is quite nice to see.Overall Score: 8/10-Spoilers-The thing that puzzled me most was the fact that one of the step sisters was actually one of the good guys. I thought that both were supposed to be rotten. Still, she was cute and it wasn't the perfect match towards the fairy tale or else there would have been a fairy godmother popping up... and that would have made it a fantasy movie. Another thing that got me thinking was the fact that the part in the fairy tale where the godmother's spell lasted till 12 midnight was not included at all. I thought they could have brought that element in somewhere making the Grim brothers include it in the tale. Pity about that.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

One can see that it was written as a fairy tale, but if you look in the Goofs section about this film you will notice that the writer didn't pay too much attention to actual history.  Thus, it is a fantasy even though magical things don't exactly occur.  This is Drew Barrymore's best film since Firestarter, which was an entirely different sort of role for her.  I must commend many of the other reviewers who have written about this film. You have described Ever After extremely well.  But, I will give it a higher score (10) than most of you did.

It is an excellent combination of old-fashionedness and modern culture, which is just what I like.  All the puns, jokes, and funny extras certainly make the movie more interesting.

98,AVES-2,A Great Modern Day Cinderella,8,27 July 1999,"""Ever After"" is a great modern day version of the Cinderella Story. It is not perfect but it works on many levels and it thoroughly entertains by taking liberties with the details while sticking closely to the basic plot.The acting is great. Drew Barrymore once again proves that she can breathe life into any character she is given and Angelica Houston is excellent as the wicked step-mother. The rest of the cast also turn in above average performances and each character has a little something to add to the whole.The one thing that is noticeably missing is the magical aspects that make the original a fairy tale. There is no fairy godmother or spells that expire upon the stroke of midnight. The myth has been debunked and we are left with a story that is actually believable. Both the heroes and villians are three dimensional characters; the step-mother is wicked but she also has her reasons for hating Cinderella. The prince is charming but he is also a spoiled brat and a snob at times.Some people may not like the attempt to take the fairy out of the fairy tale but think of how silly it would look to present a fairy godmother in anything other than cartoon form. Also, in a more societal perspective, we are consumed with explaining the myth out of everything. From the formation of Earth to UFO sightings, we are constantly finding rational explanations to reaffirm our perception of the world. What could be more fitting than to explain the story of Cinderella in rational terms that ignore the more fanciful aspects of the children's tale.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

User rating for this boring saga is higher than for the best ever filmed Cinderella-film Czechoslovakian `Three nuts for Cinderella, (Tri orísky pro Popelku (1973))' that I personally consider being a real masterpiece. It just proves how provincial the American audience has become and how USA addicted are in the rest of the world. Of course I admit that `Ever After' is not the worst film ever made but there is virtually nothing special about it. Mrs. Barrymore is bleaker than I could ever imagined, the Prince seems too old and serious, the story twist involving Da Vinci seems cheap (though it could have been rather interesting in more talented hands).

One day, she encounters a man who rides on a horse, and she misunderstands the man tries to rob her father's horse, therefore, she throws a stone toward him. Later, she realizes he is a prince and she apologizes to him. He is so kind a person and since then the relation between the two gets better. The prince declares that he finds his future wife in a dance party because he does not want to marry a woman his father introduce. His real purpose is to get Daniel. Daniel manages to prepare for the party and goes there. Although she meets the prince again, her stepmother comes out that Daniel is a servant in public. Therefore, the reunion results to fail. However, the prince learns what is a genuine love. The first time I watched this film, I was so impressed and attracted because this is different from Cinderella story I've known. The part which shows such a different thing from what I've known is that Daniel fight for the prince or herself with bad people. A clip where Daniel uses sword is amazing.

My husband watched it for the first time when we were just dating and he thought it was really good. I think he might be a little tired of it now though since I watch it all the time. I haven't really met anyone who doesn't like this movie. It's hard not to like it. It's a romantic movie with comedy and action.

In the background, of course, still have the wicked stepmother and sisters who are endeavoring to ensure that Cinderella does not live ""happily ever after"". This Cinderella is a feisty one who will fight and protect those she loves and all she wants in return is love. The prince falls in love with her heart, mind and soul before he learns her real name. He isn't a perfect prince but he grows through his relationship with Danielle. The cast is extremely good.I really did not believe anyone could remake Cinderella in a way that I would enjoy.

113,Jjfilmeyfilm,"Slightly Disappointed, But Oh Well",7,1 November 2021,"Posted on Letterboxd on August 25 2021.To be completely honest, I was expecting better from this filmA historically accurate revision of a classic fairytale without any edgyness? Sign me right up, please; that sounds like a welcome change to the grimdark ""wurh make everything edgy and evil"" thing you normally see from revisions.Well... This film delivered on that QUITE well. I'd take it any day over the average Diseaseney live action revision, adaptation etc. That's not to say it's without it's errors...For starters, in a realistic point of view, how does a noble end up being demoted to ""commoner"" just because of the untimely death of a parent? Unless her title was relinquished or abdicated in some way, she'd still be a noble, the heir to the estate and it's servants at that. That didn't feel well thought out, to me. But who knows? Maybe I'm wrong in every single way and it is permissable for an unrelated stepfamily to gain the estate, but just unlikely. Thankfully, there's nothing supernatural rammed into the story.Historical nitpicking aside, Drew Barrymore's accent, particularly in parts where her character got a bit shouty, fell apart quicker than a jenga game with polar bears. One moment she goes from speaking like the queen's goddaughter and within a femtosecond she sounds like a character from a highschool Shakespeare production. But oh well, she wouldn't have been my number one pick for this role anyway; I wasn't expecting The Godfather from her, but she did do the job surprisingly well. Dougray Scott's prince made up for the majority of my issues with her, in my opinion.One of the movies huge redeeming factors is the costume design, particularly of Cinders and her wicked step-mother, played by the brilliant if slightly typecast Anjelica Huston. Every seam of every section of every item of clothing just manages to slide across the fine line between infectious Hollywood brilliance, and being within *relative* historic tastfulness. My particular favourite is, quite predictably, the dress that is actually worn to the ball. I won't spoil anything here, but it is quite extravagant.So, how is it? I'd give this film a solid 6/10. I appreciate the non-edgyness of this revision, but if the choice in main role was swapped, the acting a little less hammed, plus the odd inconsistency at the start which I won't address again rewritten, I'd bump it up to 8/10. Anjelica Huston is a great and odious villain as usual, the costume design is sublime (in my opinion), plus the film doesn't overextend itself into a snore-catagory borefest; it does what it needs to do, and leaves you with a fairly enjoyable experience in mind.Watch this if you're a romance enjoyer who wants something new, yet familiar.Stay the hell away if you don't like soppy acting and inordinate amounts of 90s cheese.That is all.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
114,FigNewton,"After Everything Is Said, Best Cinderella Ever!",10,3 September 2001,"From the very opening scene of this film I was intrigued.  I knew it was a Cinderella story and I wondered what the difference to this version would be.  I was expecting the usual pumpkin turning into a coach, fairy godmother, magic tale we've all been fed with since the first time we read Cinderella.  I have to say, this was the best Cinderella movie EVER!  The fairy tale spun into a more reality based life story was done so expertly, it's almost believable!When we hear the Grimms' Brothers talk about the contrived story of Cinderella, the glass/fur slipper, and all the rumors around the story itself, we're intrigued further as how one of her great, great grandaughter's sets the record straight giving us the push we need as an audience to see, even consider how in the world could this ever have taken place?  How are the writers going to pull this one off?!I have to say they did an excellent job!  The storytelling was awesome.  It was written so beautifully that it does give you an entire different appreciation for the Cinderella story.The acting was wonderful.  I liked the fact that although handsome, Dougray Scott wasn't the perfect vision of Prince Charming in all respects.  He had many flaws to his character which made the story realistic.  Drew Barrymore made me laugh and cry as Danielle and Angelica Houston was excellentally cast as the wicked stepmother...even her name sounds wicked, ""Baroness Rhodmila De Ghent""  The two stepsisters were also great.  Marguerite was totally detestable, I mean *really* whereas Jacqueline was sweeter and you got to like her being the least favored of the Baroness' daughters.****Mild Spoilers***** If you haven't seen it.There were so many touching scenes that made this movie memorable.  Two of my favorites: (1) The scene when Maurice comes back home after Danielle buys back his freedom and his wife sees him in the distance and they just run to each other.  Beautifully acted and filmed!  It gives us a glimpse into what this story is all about...""true love"" (2) The royal court scene when the Baroness is interrogated by the King and Queen.  The spiciest part of this segment is when Henry calls out to Marguerite and announces his wife.  I just clapped!  Talk about sweet, sweet revenge!Overall this is a wonderful movie!  Don't bother with the accuracy of history or the other little insignificant stuff others have nit-picked about this movie.  It is still just a story.  Beautifully acted, beautifully filmed and written.  Whoever didn't like this must've either been too blind or spaced-out and missed the entire basis of the movie.  It is very much worth your time and money.  If you don't have it on video or DVD, what're you waiting for?  I've watched it about 15 times already!

Drew Barrymore personified this interpretation of Cinderella like no other. Angelica Houston was a kick ass evil stepmother. The combination of these two dynamite stars in these two classic roles created an unequaled magic. And of course let's not forget the freakishly handsome Dougray Scott who played Prince Henry. He graced the screen with a hypnotic charm that challenges any prince any day. This is my all time favourite movie. I can watch it over and over again.

Where ""Ever After"" went wrong was that it knew where it was going, and it knew that we knew where it was going, unfortunately it took two hours to get there. It had the potential to be a great film with the supporting cast it had. Drew Barrymore is surprisingly likeable, Anjelica Huston is perfectly hateable. Unfortunately all the characters were stuck in a very formulated plot that didn't stray too far from the original story. There weren't any major surprises, there weren't any new themes presented. Maybe they should have set it in the 90's like the latest Romeo and Juliet, at least then it would have been interesting. All in all, not a terrible movie, just not a very good one.

Nothing in the movie really popped out at me as being great.  The dialogue was good at times, but really lagged most of the time too.  ""A bird could love a fish, but where would they live?""  Come on.  How many times have we heard lines like that?  Usually only in the movies that we all love to make fun of for saying stuff like that (anyone remember the one-liners from Batman and Robin?  [shudder]).  Anjelica Huston was good in it, but it was far from her best role yet.  This is one of those movies that you hear is good, but you leave the theater wishing that you had gone to see something else instead and just waited for this one to be the HBO Friday Night movie that you watch only when you don't have something else to do that night, so can I please have my money back?",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

It didn't have a really original concept, it didn't rise above other movies playing on the theme of prince charming and opposites attract. The plot was lame (in my opinion) and kind of scattered around.After watching I said to myself, here's a waste of 2 (!) hours. Drew Barrymore has good intentions, but she don't know how to chose 'em!Now you can imagine how surprised I was to find out that: 1) this movie has a 7.5 rating. 2) it is number 39 in the IMDb's 'Top 50 movies voted for by female users'.

Being a female myself, I call for all you out there, who watched this movie: Women Unite - Give this Movie a Law Grade! Revote for it or just cancel your vote altogether, through your personal vote history. (http://us.imdb.com/register/votes/history).

I went to appease my girlfriend, whom I frequently drag to ""guy movies."" But I really, really liked this movie. It's Cinderella, as you know, but without the magic. In place of the fairy godmother, there's Leonardo DaVinci. Barrymore's heroine is the best role model for girls I think I've ever seen in a movie. She does things for herself. She saves the day. She finds true love through being smart. It's a bright, funny, realistic twist on the old story, and it's about time someone came up with it.

122,uruguay-2,A Diane du Pothers bio?,3,31 October 2000,"This is supposed to be the true story of the Cinderella myth, of a young girl who married the dauphin. I supposed that this is inspirited in the Diane (Danielle?) du Pothers life, a cult dame who became the mistress (not the wife who was the famous Catherine of Medicis) of Henri II the Valois, who rule the country with him until his death in 1558. The movies recreates very well  the Renacimiento ages, that includes one of the most prominent figures  Leonardo Da Vinci. But there is too much boring dialogue, Danielle looks too much strong and the historical failures are evident.(for example the Spanish dynasty was a German family so they were thin and blond, not like Cuban refugees, or Thomas More wrote Utopia only five years before Da Vinci Disease, so how Danielle could read that book when she was a child, Queen Mary was Charles the V sister, and was the step mother not the mother of the dauphin, also I can not remember if France have lands in America at that time etc).  I prefer one hounded more time Disney magical and charming movie, thing that here does not appear. However the cast was good. The best performance was made by Angelica Houston, a very versatile actress who needs more important roles. There is also good Dougray Scott as the prince, and in her little moments Melanie Lynskey (the perfidy girl of Heavenly Creatures). Even I still think that Kate Winslet was the best option for the role, Drew Barrymore looks beautiful, and her performance is not bad, more than that  she convinced as the goody heroine, this movie is a kind of lucrative Hollywood redemption to an ex bad girl. I give to this boring  movie a three for their performances and the age reconstrution..",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

The cast is superb and the overall feel fun, excitingand touching.  I think the thing I noticed most on viewing this again recently is thatAnjelica Huston and Megan Dodds are wonderfully wicked as TheBaroness (evil stepmother) and Marguerite (the ugly ""souled""stepsister)-- just watching them manipulate, connive and belittlemakes my skin crawl.  Perhaps it is a caricature to some extent butis still incredibly perfect in this context.Drew Barrymore, of course, is well-cast as Danielle-- our feministCinderella.  She being only about 23 at the time and having madetons of movies, is a perfect choice-- standing up for and believingin herself in the face of the impossible.  Melanie Lynskey is sosweet and tries so hard as Jacqueline-- the shadow to the thinner(albeit more horrid) Marguerite.  Dougray Scott was also a goodchoice for Henri, the Prince Charming.  Perhaps some could havedone better but he was fine with me.Also Patrick Godfrey deserves mention as Leonardo di Vinci... anice touch to the cast and his character adds a nice wrinkle to thestory.

The way Cinderella character portrayed in this movie is different from the story.Cinderella here likes books, brave, intelligent, innocent and beautiful.Drew Berrymore is just at her best as Cinderella.The inconsistent part is of Leonardo Da Vinci in this movie.

I listen to the CD of the beautiful music George Fenton composed for this movie. Andy Tennant directed with just the right proportion of reality (beautiful cinematography, costumes, period backgrounds) and fantasy (slightly over the top acting and hauntingly beautiful music) to create the ultimate Cinderella story. Drew Barrymore is as charmingly beautiful as she was in The Wedding Singer. Angelica Huston's nasty character is a pleasure to watch.

I would even get into costume and play a game based off this movie on the varanda (it was called ""Roseamon Palice"").My favorite scene is the scene where Daniell comes to the mask saying just breeze.

The story is based on the Cinderella story with a few twists that will make you laugh from the beginning till the end.The first time I heard about the movie, was in the cinema when I was watching the preview. the film looked excellent through the romance and action adventure of the trailer but when I started to watch the real movie, it hit me that it was not what I had expected and longed for. The action is very mild, but the adventure is quite interesting since it involves different historical figures, e.g Leonardo DaVinci. All these can be ignored for the beauty in this movie is the romance.Defying all laws, the prince loves the commoner whom he thinks comes from a noble family. the tragedy in the movie make you cry and the delightful humour will make you laugh and remember even afterwards when you go home and have a cup of coffee.This adventurous romantic comedy drama will make you want to laugh, cry and feel the only greatness that the power of the movies can give you; you will fall in love with Ever After. It is not a regular and boring Cinderella story and it is not a 'chic flick'. As a matter of fact, it has many interesting and funny bits that will keep you going from beginning till end.Savvas Stavrou's Rating: 10/10 - A true classic.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

The locations, costumes and ""medieval"" humour are bonuses to enjoy.

I was on a military base with nothing better to do, so I saw it at our local theater. What did I expect?  A lot of nothing, really.  Drew Barrymore hasn't acted since Firestarter... maybe not even then.Wow, was I wrong!For the first time I'd ever seen, Drew actually acted!  She portrayed pain, hope, love, betrayal, determination... and so very much more!  And what a cast to support her talents!!  Anjelica Huston, as usual, rocked as the wicked and demented stepmother, giving a convincing portrayal of a character many of us grew up with in our youth.As for the rest... from props to sets to plots to dialogue, this film captivates from beginning to end.  Everything is just fairy-tale enough to be enjoyable, which a lot of people confuse for 'anachronism' or 'inaccuracy'.  It's a fairy tale, people - it's supposed to be this way.If there is a down side to this film, it comes from the forced accents used by several of the actors (including Drew) and the fickle nature of the Prince when he learns of his beloved's true nature.

139,Bod-4,Overall Very good,10,20 October 1998,"A re-hash of Cinderella, yes but done from a very different perspective. A strong female lead and a male lead lacking a direction and focus. The essence of the two characters is therefore changed very much from the fairy tale but IMHO this makes the film better. The Prince having the high station and struggling to find a role and define his life could be considered to be reminiscent of the current Prince of Wales, though I would not extend this analogy further to Danielle and compare that role with Diana.I found the portrayal of the Gypsies as being a culture of their own with their own standards as being similar to the portrayal in Tom Jones (The book, not the BBC serialisation) and it is a thought-provoking look at the differences between cultures causing clashes.The look back perspective and picture a blatant 'take' from Titanic, though this doesn't detract from the film.One glitch: In the closing scene as the camera pulls away from the chateau watch for a white car/van moving in the right hand side mid-background.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

Based loosely on the ""Cinderella"" tale, this film with believable characters and no hocus-pocus, brings Drew Barrymore's character 'Danielle' to her prince. Angelica Huston as the wicked stepmother 'Rodmilla' delivers a deliciously sadistic performance, Dougray Scott as 'Prince Henry' is appropriately handsome, and Barrymore is a very pleasant surprise. ""Ever After"" has got to be one of her best performances; she is very believable and shows none of the rough edges of some of her other film portrayals, but rather portrays a character who has noble thoughts and feelings and really does care about the people around her.

You knew that she was going to be ok, even if she didn't get the guy.  She got *herself* released from the goon who her evil stepmother sold her to.  And how sweet was her revenge.Drew Barrymore made this character come alive with her wonderful acting skill.

It was quite refreshing to see a Cinderella story where she doesn't rely on the prince to get her out of sticky situations. Drew Barrymore is surprisingly good as Danielle, the Cinderella character. Her co-star, Dougray Scott, portrays Prince Henry as a complex and intellegent young man. He knows what he wants but is unsure how to get it. What makes this film fun, though, is the evil stepmother Rodmilla and the evil stepsister Margurite. (I don't consider Jacqueline evil because she turns out to be a good person.) The scenes where these two scheme and pry their way into the royal family are hilarious and their punishment is deserved.

So, when I finally saw the film Iwasn't prepared for such a delightful experience. The dialogue iswitty, the characters are complex and well written, and I thinkDrew Barrymore did a splendid job as Danielle.

Your idea about DIANE de POITIER (that's how it's spelled :)) is not bad, but I don't think that the lady in question would have been as good and idealistic as ""Danielle"". I think that Madame de Poitier was more ambitious than philosophic... Furthermore, a painting that is believed to be that of Diane de Poitier is seen hanging in the background in one scene of the film.About your wondering if France had possessions in America back then, well, yes, Jacques Cartier, who is mentioned in the movie, had reached what is now Quebec in 1534.

She is absolutely delightful in the lead role and her English accent is quite sweet.Angelica Houston who plays the wicked step mother is excellent in this role, playing a character that is not simply evil but adding a more complex set of emotions to the role.The locations are lovely and so too are the costumes.

148,jt2012,Ever after,9,11 February 2012,"""Ever After"" is a wonderfully imaginative romance. It's a classic Cinderella tale set in 16th-century France and revolves around an independent young woman named Danielle. Although she works as a servant for her stepmother, Danielle is anything but weak and subservient. She is passionate and strong-willed, qualities that lead her to the French court dressed as a wealthy courtier to save a man's life. There she meets the handsome Prince Henry, who is jaded by his suffocating royal lifestyle. He is fascinated by Danielle and her thirst for life and adventure, and they fall deeply in love - but her jealous stepmother will do anything to keep them apart.Drew Barrymore turns in a stunning performance as Danielle. Her emotions are raw and realistic and she gives the character charm, wit, and beauty.Anjelica Huston brings a third dimension to her role as the ""evil"" stepmother, who is usually just portrayed as a flat character. In this movie she is an ambitious mother who would do anything to make her own daughter a queen.The Prince is also usually a pretty flat, cliché character, but Dougray Scott brought a refreshingly human side to him and portrayed his struggles and conflicts very well.The script is strong for a romantic fairy tale and the cinematography is gorgeous. There is one scene in which Danielle is floating on her back in the river, a dreamy and breathtaking moment that describes her carefree nature perfectly. The music composed by George Fenton is lovely - I recommend the soundtrack for this movie too, especially ""Walking On Water.""",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

157,gypsy14,A wonderful fairy tale,10,25 June 2001,This has to be one of the best movies I have ever seen.  The character interaction between the prince and Drew Barrymore is memorable.  They have so much chemistry on screen it makes you swoon.  These two characters work so well together that you can really believe they would fall in love with each other.Despite the time period they show Drew's character as a strong and independent woman.  She's shown as intelligent and kind and a wonderful female role model.  I liked how they made the younger sister as not evil.  I mean she wasn't perfect but her character was not all bad and not all good. The servants in the movie actually seem to age in this film which is better than most films show.The character of DaVinci is inspiring.  He plays the typical knowledgeable old man with a twist of humor.  This Prince's character has the arrogance you expect from a royal family but he's not a snob.  The movie is so wonderful it's hard to describe in words.  It's the picture perfect love story with a hint or comedy entwined.  It's a definite must see.,Ever After - A Cinderella Story
158,medu_san,Perfect show for all ages,9,3 November 2019,"This is Cinderella with a twist. In this version, Cinderella is intelligent with a personality of her own. It is empowering for little girls and shows them how they can stand up for themselves are deserving of attention from even the most popular of men, ( a prince here) even if they come from a background of poverty. It shows that money or status does not define love. It teaches boys to stand up for truth and right and against societal standards that are harmful. It is not a prince saving her anymore than she is saving the prince in this one.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
159,Black_Man24,I love this movie.,10,25 December 2007,"Absolutely perfect. I am a sucker for any fairytale movie; especially Cinderella types. This one is almost brilliant. The way they portray the fairytale in a very real time without the usual clichés (Fairy godmother, animals turning into humans and vice versa.) though nice, would have made it a bit cheesy when using real live people.Drew Barrymore is a wonderful Cinderella. Her Cinderella does not wait for fate; she takes action. She is strong-willed, beautiful, and adventurous, but she never bashes it over your head. She is very vulnerable too. Angelica Huston is a great evil stepmother. She plays the part with relish. She is very elegant, calculated and manipulative, borderline sociopath. The mean stepsister gets over the top at times, but she is very good. I like the way they have one nice stepsister and one evil one. The prince got a little on my nerves, but he was good too. This movie is a classic. I hope more movies come out like this one.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

This movie is refreshing compared to the romantic comedies we are bombarded with today. For today romance of this kind is branded to be 'unrealistic' which makes me love this movie even more. She never slept with him before she married him, never had an ex, didn't turn into a drunk or drug addict, never had to talk incessantly about her career, no ridiculous night club scenes, relied more on her intelligence and wit then her looks and what was wonderfully refreshing was prince charming was exactly the same. They really don't portray couples like this anymore. Which makes us think they don't exist........but they do.. bravo for Ever After!",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

Drew Barrymore, as Danielle, shows us what is undoubtedly one of her best performances ever as she breaks out of her wild party-girl mold and shows us that she can still act. Dougray Scott introduces us to Prince Henry, a delightful character who is thoroughly explored and does not remain a mystery without a name or a face. These are real characters with depth.

168,Josabeli,Absolutely amazing!,9,26 January 2021,"A lot of spoiliers!!This movie of Cinderella is the most enchanting, interesting and mesmerizing version I have ever seen. And a touch of humour!Cinderella, played by Drew Barrymore, is a strongwill, intelligent young woman who doesn´t sit around waiting for Prince Charming. Instead she pretends to be a noble women to save one of the servants in the household and other things.The movie follows the main story. You know, Cinderella cleans and serves her stepmother and her two stepsisters and there is a ball. But there the similarities end.One of the stepsisters are kind, the Ferry Godmother is Leonardo Da Vinci and two of the servants and a friend are the mice that helps Cinderella get to the ball. Prince Charming, played by Dougray Scott, gets to be a real person with both positive and negative traits instead to be reduced as just as it sounds, Charming. The Stepmother, perfectly portraited by Angelica Huston, is the witch with a capital W. She also get to be a real character instead of a sterotypical kliché in a vulnerable scene with Drew Barrymore.Ok, so the only problem I have is the evil stepsister. Of course, she is evil as evil can be but there a many scenes that Melanie Dodds just overplay it and that is a real shame in an otherwise, perfect movie. There are some goofs in it but every movie has it, it´s impossible for the cast and crew to have control of every little angle and detail.So, do see it!!! You won´t be disappointed!! Pardon my grammar, english is not my mother tounge.P.S Watch the beautiful ball gown! D.S",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

170,tartysheep,gd gd movie,8,12 January 2005,"I saw this movie once on ITV2 and loved it so much that i had to buy when i saw it in HMV. The actors and actresses are just perfect for the parts. I think Cinderella could have been played by someone prettier than Drew Barrymore but i guess you can't have it both ways. I liked the sibling rivalry between the two step sisters, it added more humour to the plot and also showed the fact that the stepmother hadn't specifically picked out Danielle's life to ruin. The saddest part of the film was when the prince found out the truth about Danielle- that she was not the Countess he had met but a servant girl. If i were Danielle i would never have taken back that stuck up cow of a prince, that dude needs a serious attitude adjustment. This film is definitely recommended to everyone- so watch it!!!",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
171,Deerbra15,Ever After for ever and ever,10,19 December 2014,"I was a child when I first saw this film and it has always been one of my absolute favourites. The setting, the costumes (especially Danielle's ball gown and glass slippers), and the storyline are just superb, followed by great performances from all the actors including Melanie Lynskey, Timothy West, Judy Parfitt, Megan Dodds and Patrick Godfrey.Drew Barrymore and Dougray Scott are perfect for the roles of Danielle and Prince Henry and you fall in love with both of them from the start. Drew Barrymore turns the usual 'damsel' Cinderella into a strong-minded, and strong-willed female lead, whilst Dougray Scott ignites the rebellious side to the prince Charming of the fairytale. Anjelica Houston is graciously ruthless in her portrayal of the Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent aka the evil stepmother, and both Lynskey and Dodds make very comical 'ugly stepsisters'.All in all, this film is a fantastic retelling of Hans Christian Andersen's classic fairytale, with a wonderful cast, both leading and supporting, and leaves you with that magical feeling of warmth and happiness.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

173,warren-taylor,One of the Very Best Movies of All Time,10,14 June 2008,"The movie ""Ever After"" is one of the most lovely, charming, romantic, and dramatic movies ever. I cried many times, in both joy and sorrow, as the story unfolded. The first viewing I shall never forget. The 10th viewing I shall never forget, even better than the first 9 viewings!Humble Danielle (Cinderella) tries to set everything straight with the prince, attempting to explain that she is a mere peasant girl commoner, and not of royal blood. But the prince loves her so much, he never gives her a chance to confess. Then when the time comes for the confession, it is the wrong time! Her confession is turned aside to her destruction and grief at the grand costume ball. She comes into the scene of the resplendent mask ball festivity, dressed as the most noble and beautiful creature imaginable, with gorgeous white gown and gossamer angel wings, to the rapturous thrill of the Prince, the Queen, and the King. The Prince is love-struck. But two or three minutes later, after her true identity is revealed by her heartless step mother who reveals everything, Danielle (Cinderella) leaves the scene humiliated and in tears, with wings clipped (literally one wing torn off), losing her glass slipper on the way, as she runs to escape from the Prince and depart the royal costume ball, a totally humiliated peasant girl dashing into the cold dark night of a fierce rainstorm. She ends up soaking wet and grief stricken, wearing one glass slipper and one broken angel's wing, sobbing uncontrollably in a tattered wedding gown that is filthy and ruined, weeping in the soaking rain, while thunder and lightning are roaring all around her.Oh my, oh my! What a great movie love story this is, to see how this tragedy is later reversed, so that the beautiful Cinderella Danielle finally captures her equally handsome Prince Charming Henry.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

A very simple story, yet told well through the characters, costumes, accents, and relationships. When true love is separated because of class structure they must overcome this obstacle.....and we root for love in all its forms. The climatic scene at the ball when the prince must decide on a suitor is predictable yet entertaining. We all know what is going to happen in the end yet we keep watching rooting for them.

The story's updating is good and I like the Da Vinci character, but the whole thing just lacked anything in the way of conflict until the last half hour.  I felt no compassion for the Prince and was bored for a solid 1 and 1/2 hours.  It needed to decide if it were a serious period tale of a servant breaking free, or if it was a live-action Disney rehash of it's successful animated tale; it teetered on the edge of both.

180,Fran-8,Cinderella turned Mulan,10,7 August 1998,"""Ever After"" is a charming movie based on the fairy tale ""Cinderella. "" The basic story-line is the same except Cinderella's name is really Danielle (Drew Barrymore), a brave and stubborn young lady.        Danielle's father dies three days after he marries Rodmilla (Anjelica Houston), Danielle's new stepmother. Rodmilla brings two stepsisters for Danielle, the beautiful Maguerite (Megan Dodds) who is a meanie, and the chubby Jacqueline (Melanie Lynskey), who's really every nice. Danielle is, of course, a servant in the household, sleeping by the fireplace and getting soot all over her. The movie suggests that Danielle only stays with her stepmother because she wants to be loved for she cannot remember being loved by her mother. In this movie, the stepmother also really loved Danielle's father.        Danielle meets Prince Henry (Dougray Scott) when she was picking apples one morning. He as running away from an arranged marriage with the Princess of Spain and to do that, he stole the horse that belonged to Daniell's father. Later, she ran into him again, dressed as a courtier, trying to save an old servant that Rodmilla sold to pay her debt.They clicked (well, sort of, if you don't count those temper tantrums that people who supposedly like eachother have in the movies). They got along quite well until Rodmilla unmasks Danielle's true status in life at the ball (or masque, whatever you want to call it). Drew Barrymore scores a high one as Cinderella, though she can't keep an English accent to save her life. She can switch quite well from being sweet to angry and to sad. She makes a very lovely Danielle. Dougray Scott makes a good hotheaded prince but nothing that people will remember for the rest of their lives.  Anjelica Houston's portrayal of the stepmother, cold, evil yet someone in pain over Danielle's father was really great, especially,the way she raises her eyebrows. Also, the King, was a lovable dumpling that got a few laughs. Overall, the movie was a ""correct"" version of Cinderella. It was very sappy and destroyed a few romantic parts (so it's a ""correct"" Cinderella, but it's still a fairy tale!). Since there is such a big fuss over ""Mulan"" being the heroine-not-in-distress, Danielle is definitely summer's second Mulan.  It's still worth seeing though not worth seeing 5 times (Let's not turn this into another ""Titanic!"")",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

192,user-666-622108,Ever After,10,24 April 2013,"Rating: A+With a great script, captivating plot, and accomplished actors, Ever After is an entertaining and highly enjoyable historical romance film. Given the medieval scenery and attire, the film pulls the audience directly into the bustle of the late eighteenth century. From sword fighting, romance, comedy, and drama, this film seemingly pulls all of these aspects together into one great film. Each time that I watch this movie, I feel connected to the main character Danielle, played by Drew Barrymore. Through each climatic scene where she faces set-backs and adversity I want her to succeed and find romance in the end. This film, and more specifically Barrymore's acting, has the ability to make the audience feel sad when Danielle is rejected by the prince in front of the entire kingdom or when she is sold off to pay her step mother's debt and happy when the prince saves her and asks for her forgiveness. Although the film is set in the eighteen century, it is easy to relate to Danielle, who despite hardships, has managed to make the most out of her seemingly horrible life. This film is a retelling of the fairy tale Cinderella. With evil step mothers and sisters, an extravagant ball, a pompous prince waiting to marry for love, and even with a glass slipper, the film aligns itself with the same occurrences of the classic fairytale. Noticing the cyclical nature of fairy tales and how they are often redone, it is important to take a look at the common theme between fairy tales and their remakes. In both the fairytale version and in the movie Ever After, the main theme that is shared is that evil behavior will have repercussions and that good will always prevail. In both of the films, the step mothers serve as an oppressive force to the main protagonist. However, in Ever After one of the step sisters helps Danielle, yet comes short of advocating against her mistreatment. Nonetheless, in both of the films, the main protagonist succeeds and finds love when truly all hope seems lost. The glass slipper is probably the most apparent similarity between the two films, which indicates the importance of the symbol. At the end of Ever After, Prince Henry played by Dougray Scott, after begging Danielle for forgiveness, kneels down and replaces the slipper Danielle lost at the ball. This also happened in the classic story. Yet in Ever After, Prince Henry rejected Danielle for falsely imposing as a countess. In the final scene, Prince Henry, after saving her from Pierre Le Pieu, a vile man who is taken with Danielle played by O'Brien, has to ask Danielle to forgive him for his past actions. Although the core message has transferred between the two films, there are differences. In Ever After, Danielle does not represent the typical female fairytale character waiting idly for the price to sweep her off of her feet. Danielle has read books and often times challenges Prince Henry about various topics. Her conviction astounds Prince Henry, who falls in love with her personality over her looks. They say that behind ever great leader, is a strong woman providing support, and that notion is clearly represented in the movie, as Danielle offers her ideas on how to improve the kingdom. Ever After offers the audience the possibility to escape into a new and exciting world, where true love always prevails and evil people are always punished. In contrast to the real world, Ever After offers the audience a chance to escape into a different time period and a new life where there is always a happy ending.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

197,LeadingLadybug,Beautiful Love Story,10,12 February 2006,"""Ever After"" is a wonderfully imaginative romance. It's a classic Cinderella tale set in 16th-century France and revolves around an independent young woman named Danielle. Although she works as a servant for her stepmother, Danielle is anything but weak and subservient. She is passionate and strong-willed, qualities that lead her to the French court dressed as a wealthy courtier to save a man's life. There she meets the handsome Prince Henry, who is jaded by his suffocating royal lifestyle. He is fascinated by Danielle and her thirst for life and adventure, and they fall deeply in love - but her jealous stepmother will do anything to keep them apart.Drew Barrymore turns in a stunning performance as Danielle. Her emotions are raw and realistic and she gives the character charm, wit, and beauty.Anjelica Huston brings a third dimension to her role as the ""evil"" stepmother, who is usually just portrayed as a flat character. In this movie she is an ambitious mother who would do anything to make her own daughter a queen.The Prince is also usually a pretty flat, cliché character, but Dougray Scott brought a refreshingly human side to him and portrayed his struggles and conflicts very well.The script is strong for a romantic fairy tale and the cinematography is gorgeous. There is one scene in which Danielle is floating on her back in the river, a dreamy and breathtaking moment that describes her carefree nature perfectly. The music composed by George Fenton is lovely - I recommend the soundtrack for this movie too, especially ""Walking On Water.""A wonderful movie for all lovers of romance! 10/10",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

204,TexMac,Second best movie of 1998,10,29 March 1999,"Not just for girls!  Teenage boys enjoy too, along with their fathers. This is an excellent modern and believable version of how men can see the beauty in all women.  Drew's character is not the most physically beautiful character, her stepsister is, but the inner beauty is what counts. I find it ironic, that when Danielle looks her worst, and she knows it, is the moment that she gets the wedding proposal. A girl, acknowledged by her neighbor as the true force in the house, has to survive among a strong, dominating woman. Exposed to books by her father, I easily believed that Danielle, an orphan at age 8, loses all social ranking in resonance France. She knows herself to be a servant class, and the penalty of 5 days in the stockade for pretending to be a member of another high social class.  But for the loyalty of a fellow house servant, she takes the risk, and still needs to convince the prince that her task is worthy. The prince is also a believable character, confused, educated by those that lacked a spirit of conviction, in the shadow of a father who is king of all of France. The scenery is wonderful, the clothing adds to the story, and British accents in a French story, oh well, that's what Hollywood has been doing since the first talkies. Just a few loose ends in the story keep this from being my favorite movie. The shoes that are too big, noticed by Leonardo, but never is mentioned again.  The prince referring to Danielle as one of ""them"" is puzzling, as I cannot find any previous reference to a ""them"" in the movie.I'd like to see the directors cut next, then a sequel. You hear that Fox!?",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
205,linxueyi,Captivating facial expressions for ever after...,10,28 March 1999,"This is a movie where Drew Barrymore is harmoniously cast as the little cinder girl. Her most admirable talent lies in her expressions of sadness, anger, and love. She is a victim of those hateful people, and yet she is a victim that could not have been better at holding our feelings hostage at every turn of her facial expression, be it of the curling of her brows or the slightest tilt of her head or perhaps simply turning her face to the side a bit. Either way, we can only feel joy that she does live happily ever after, and that she simply lived.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

207,Vyeska,I loved this movie,10,27 December 1999,"I love this movie from beginning to end.  I thought that Drew Barrymore as the heroine was great since she is not by any means a perfect beauty.  Her accent left a lot to be desired, but I always forget as I become more enchanted by the love story.  The prince is gorgeous and I think it is hilarious how pompous he is at the beginning (and throughout most of the movie).  The costumes were beautiful (I love the dress she is wearing at the very end) and I really like how the story appears to be a part of real history.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys a good romantic fantasy and who is not annoyed by the dated values (the heroine is very headstrong and well read for that time period).",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

210,phedretinke,All-around fantastic,10,8 July 2006,"This may be a romance, but it honestly appeals to everyone. It's also one of very few movies I can watch over and over again without getting tired of it. The humor is adorable, and despite my distaste for some of the actors (Drew Barrymore included), they all did a great job. There isn't a great deal of realism involved - aside from the fact that it's a retelling of the fairy tale Cinderella, the main characters speak in British accents, despite supposedly being French. My European history is also quite rusty, so I have no idea whether the royalty in the film is appropriate for the time period. The story, however, can be applied to any time period and any situation; its accuracy is fairly irrelevant and easy to overlook.I've shown this to a number of guys who hate 'chick flicks', and I have yet to get a negative response. Ever After is not a film just for girls - it's a story for dreamers.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

I'm so glad someone had the sense to make a fairytale were the leading lady isn't a whelp who wouldn't say boo to a goose! It's about time females in historical dramas stood up for themselves! Drew Barrymore was amazing! I was o jealous I didn't get to be Danielle. She's a much better role model to young girls than feeble old Cinderellaever was! Loved the stepmother, what a cow! You love to hate her! Don't know what else to say just that it's visually stunning and vibrant and I wish more films would be made like this!

It is rich in heartfelt messages, and is truly, i believe the best Cinderella story ever made. Drew Barrymore is fabulous as Cinderella and her prince does not fall short of the 'charming' title. Angelica Housten is a marvel to watch as she provides a compelling performance of the evil step mother. I am a great fan of this movie, and day to day, see myself quoting it. This movie is truly a sweet and delectable film for all the hopeless romantics out there! I find no fault with this movie, 10!!!!

215,lydiab6,What An Awful Boring Movie,1,17 August 2011,"I watched this a year ago and im suffering through this drivel again as a favor and its still agonizing. I am a female and all for feminism and social justice but the way its shown is so unbelievable. Also, if someone in the status of Anjelica's character became a widow, I don't think she would still have been single and raising three children in that period. Also, as someone already mentioned she is shown as a tough, kick-ass girl but spent most of her life never fighting back her family, that i cant really see. Drew does an alright job as Cinderella but ,typical her, she plays the character like a lost, defenseless puppy. Add in the the prince who is played by the miscast Dougray Scott, and you've got one of the worst movie couples. The prince comes off as a boring, one-dimensional, rude, self absorbed idiot. I can only remember chuckling once through the whole movie where the Spanish princess sobbed at the thought of marrying the loser prince. The script is poorly written and the kind of thing only someone 13 and under would really enjoy. Pretty much, save your money and your time and pick ANYTHING else. I would especially recommend The Princess Bride, which has much more wit and humor.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
216,Ack423,This movie is perfect! <3,10,15 October 2013,"Being a history lover, normally historical inaccuracies would totally bother me. But the movie is so heartwarming and funny that I could care less. Drew Barrymore is absolutely the perfect person to play the lead character and she is definitely a good role model for a modern generation of fairytale lovers! Instead of waiting for Prince Charming (in this case Prince Henry), played by the talented Dougray Scott, she goes off the palace to find him herself! Along with charming friends, and help from a wise Da Vinci, she can overcome the treacherous obstacles set up by her evil stepmother (played by the talented Anjelica Houston), her vain stepsister, a noble who is out to have her for himself, and the difficulties that difference and class can bring. It is more than just a ""chick-flick"", it is classic story that everyone can enjoy and a movie that everyone must see :)",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

I work at sirius xm company( the Egyptian branch in cairo). Although it is an American company, I insist on speaking British accent in all my calls.The costumes: I like the way they dress> In my Islamic world, they just need veil. How beautifully they dressed. Long, wide, elegant dresses;perfect Muslemahs' costumes indeed. One of my dreams in life, is to get one like theses dresses.The cast: I had no doubt each time I watch this movie the Drew is a real Cinderella and the same goes for the others.

218,justpeace0-nospam,beautiful and engaging,9,1 January 2007,"Not only is this film really beautiful to look at (sets, locations, costumes, cinematography), the story is really engaging and the pacing is perfect. Drew Barrymore's performance is delightful and her character is much fuller and more interesting than your typical Cinderella. There are several really entertaining and humorous scenes, and some interesting treatments on the old theme such as Leonardo DaVinci instead of a fairy godmother. Anjelica Huston's performance is expectedly excellent, as well. Since the story is primarily a romance you might think of this as a chick flick, a genre that I rarely have any patience for. But the creative details in the story and characters make this a particularly satisfying romance even for those who avoid the genre.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
219,sailvane-1,Couldn't the screenplay be better?,7,11 January 2005,"Actually It is surprising to me when I finish watching this film and look it up in IMDb and find so many comments singing high praise to it.It is really a strong beginning, when I see Danielle's father dying, he chooses to say ""I love you"" to Danielle but not his new wife, I reckon there're rich sub text in this moment and it is full of humanity, that shows the man's last worry about the daughter, his thinking or timid(is that the word?) about his new wife, I was touched, I thought there would be some interesting adaptation in it and that could possibly make the fairytale into a more realistic story about human and love.I think the director did have the ambition to make this into a masterpiece, wonderful cinematography, charming costume and excellent proficient cast. Even the DVD menu design was the style that can amaze me. But the story doesn't seem to go on this way.Suddenly time passed with a simple voice-over, where I suppose a couple of life details of Danielle living with her step family can be cut in, to make the story's background richer and provide more preparation or reasons for the later behaviors of these four women. I always think there must be some jealous or fear in Baronese, whose husband died 2 weeks after she moved into a new land, and barely showed any attaching to her before death, which contributed, in some way, to the twisted step-mother she becomes later. As the details are not told, feeling changes of the step family are not suggested, Danielle's longing to mother-love becomes a bit of a sudden when she expresses it later in the story, though it's yet understandable. Anyway if some incidents early in their life, when Danielle and her step-sisters are young, can be told in the film, which tells the development of their different emotions to each other, the story will be better looking.I have to say the insert of Da Vinci is a pretty design, and when Danielle carries Prince Henry away in front of Gypsies the story becomes very interesting, there're also some thoughts of the screen writer (or maybe director) can be seen there that some philosophy and academic debating will give more sense of history and loyalty to the story as its background is like- The development of Prince's love to Danielle is not yet sufficient, actually that feeling seems come out of no where. I have to say that I was expecting a classic moment or an extremely beautiful shot that pushes the feeling up, but it doesn't appear either. Which makes me feel a bit lost all the way through- are there something missing? To tell how a love story starts there are many ways, sometimes it takes long sometimes it just need one scene of acting, but none has been used here I feel.I watched it again when I saw so many positive comments and I still feel those shortcomings I mentioned above are true, though I do enjoy watching it and I wouldn't mind watching it again; as a girl I think , can always please herself by watching a Cinderella story. :)",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
220,gimlisgrl,One of the best movies I have seen,10,10 August 2005,"Now when I say one of the best movies I have seen it really means a lot as I am somewhat picky as to what movies I watch and whether or not I will even see them again; but with this one I could watch it every day. Ever After is a retelling of the classic Cinderella story minus the magic pumpkins and talking mice. Set in France this story is a classic romance about a prince and a common girl who fall in love.Angelica Houston is perfect as the horrible step mother who you love to hate. But rather than just being some raving villain, what I like most about this movie is you see her side of the story. She is a woman all alone in a man's world who just lost a husband, to whom she would always come second. Second that is, to his daughter Cinderella (Drew Berymore). Dougray Scott is the wayward prince of France who struggles with his own doubts on love. Most charming in this role, we all can identify with his confused monologue debating over the concept of true love. Rather than a fairy Godmother we have a fairy Godfather in the person of Leonardo Davinci. Every actor was chosen well and wonderful in their roles; all working together to give this tale a heart and soul you won't find in any other telling of the story. This is one of the best romantic works of film, and if u want to watch a movie to fall in love with, be in love Ever After.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

It's not just a ""chick flick"" either because my father and brother thought it was terrific (although the most tantalizing thing they saw in the movie was the mechanical wave maker at the masquerade ball!)

I love how the heroin is a strong, intelligent woman and not weak as she has been portrayed in the past, as the girl who will cry when she can't go to a dance as she sits waiting for her prince charming.

229,Mr.Movie-2,The biggest surprise of the summer!,9,9 September 1998,"After seeing the trailer for `Ever After', I was anxious to see the film because it appeared to be an original, adult retelling of the familiar fairytale that would appeal to a wide variety of moviegoers. When I finished watching this wonderful film, I thought that I had seen one of the best movies released this summer! And because I work in a theater, I have been able to confirm my notion that audiences of all ages (from pre-teen females to elderly couples) would enjoy this film. Drew Barrymore is tremendously appealing in the lead role, Dougray Scott is a refreshing new face that I am anxious to see again in other roles, and Anjelica Huston was terrific as the stepmother, not entirely wicked, but certainly faithful to the tale. The interesting twists concerning the stepsisters and the `fairy godmother' are just two more innovations that enhanced the appeal and character of `Ever After'. And let us not forget about Pierre LePeu as realized by Richard O'Brien, perhaps one of the most reprehensible characters I have ever seen in a conventional character-driven motion picture. I intend to add this film to my video collection as soon as it is available despite having seen it many times on the big screen.

I picked ""Ever After"" after reading a good review. Wow.  Drew Barrymore gets better with every movie she makes.  The writers dispensed with the usual rosy glow of fairy tales and instead painted a picture of love and maturity around a tapestry of multi-dimensional characters.  Angelica Houston is wonderful as a sometimes regretfull, always bitter woman whose own fairy tale was not to be, leaving her too twisted to recognize anyone else's opportunity.  Drew honestly left me breathless and the look on her face when she admits to her step mother that all she ever wanted was for her to be loved as a daughter made my heart bounce with sympathy and admiration for her courage and determination to say what she felt, even though she knew she faced total rejection.  I left the theater with a bounce in my step and rushed to call my wife, all those romantic feelings wishing she had been there with me to enjoy this wonderfully likable story.  Please go see this!

I too was taken back into the ages of long ago and captivated for the whole time the movie played on the screen. I thought all of the actors and actresses did an outstanding job in this fairytale with such superb setting and costumes. I especially liked Drew Barrymore and Dougray Scott in their roles of Cinderella and Prince Henry, respectively. I have not been moved by a movie in years like I was with this one.

236,Louise-7,What happens to a fairy tale when you remove the magic?,10,18 December 1998,"I saw this film and expected to be deeply disappointed.  I mean what is so special about a fairytale when you take out all the fairytale elements? I have to admit, my hopes were not high, but I was most pleasantly surprised. The playing tended to be of a subtle variety, which was good, as most films of this type tend to go for ""pantomime"" play-acting.  Angelica Huston, in possibly the role that it is hardest to play subtly - after all she is the film's out and out bad guy - even managed to arouse sympathy for the situation through facial expressions only quite early on. I think having only one wicked step-sister made the film more balanced as to have only the Prince and Danielle herself the ""good"" characters would have placed completely the wrong tone, as the nature/nurture debate would have given lie to that situation. Drew Barrymore gave a good solid performance, not breathtakingly good, not astoundingly bad as may have been feared at the beginning, but one that shows she will have a good future as a straight actress. Dougray Scott made a great Prince (slightly wobbly english accent aside), he looked the part and certainly managed to convey emotional depths to the role which is usually sidelined to that of beefcake. I thought the costumes were wonderful, although the ball-gown (and make up) in the pivotal ball scene were too ""90's"" and will date well before the movie itself does. All in all I personally found it to be a most enjoyable experience, and, even though it was not my choice of entertainment for the evening it is something that I would enjoy again.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

Drew Barrymore gave another astounding performance...I almost cried at parts.  Angelica Huston always portrays an evil something-or-other quite well....so I have to give her some praise as well. Actually all the actors did real well in this movie....I didn't see a bad perormance...then again I was in shock at the emotion that this film gave off.

True, it was kinda flowery, but it's a romance, what else can you expect?'Ever After' had a really powerful cast. All the 'main' characters were incredible, but I really liked the ones who had one or two scenes at best. The leader of the gypsies, Danielle's father and the young Danielle, the princess of Spain, and Gustave all gave wonderful performances.Ok, the movie wasn't perfect. English accents in France? The tiny part with the 'Mona Lisa' painting made me smile, but it also made me groan. And for some reason, I liked the movie on my TV screen better than on the big screen.

Pleasant and predictable, but full of cardboard characters who fail to cultivate much interest in themselves beyond the idle curiosity exhibited by spectators at a chess match in which the ending is never uncertain. The revisionists revert to the traditional 'Beautiful people marry other beautiful people, ugly people marry ugly people' including the youngest step-daughter, who comes dangerously close to being an interesting character. Luckily, she doesn't get enough screen time to jeopardise the film.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

I was very pleasantly surprised. Seeing it acted out in human form made it so much more, I don't know, dare I say, believable? The screenplay contained quite a bit of humor as well that I enjoyed. Also, there was a lot of beautiful scenery of the French countryside, and that's always a plus in my book. The costumes were very unique and gorgeous to view, too.

I found the movie encouraging because I could see that one can stand through the hardships of life and overcome them in spite of all the intrigues and obstacles that are meant to stop him or her. Goodness and kindness is something so rare today, but it is appreciated by everybody (almost!). There might be something true in the saying: ""No gain without pain!"" But the final reward is great!

This is a romantic drama. It likes a ""Cinderella"" story, but it is different a little. The stepmother and her daughters overworked Cinderella is the same as the original story. In the beginning, the Grimm brothers were invited by a lady. A lady taught a story to them. The main character, Daniel, is tough, has spine, and is excellent. Thomas More's Utopia is the key. Her father gave her this book as a remembrance of her. Daniel met the prince in the open air. But Daniel has a lot of problems. The stepmother and her daughters disturb Daniel some points. They burned her treasure, her father's memory. It shocked her. The reason why I like this movie is this movie's story is different from the original ""Cinderella"" story. So, the main character, Daniel, is a very strong woman, and she tried to catch happiness by herself. It is very cool and I long for her. In the original ""Cinderella"" story, the main character, Cinderella is passive. She was became happy by the princes, the witch, mice, birds, and other animals.

I think Drew Barrymore is convincing and sweet in this movie. She shows the conviction necessary to make you love her character. Angelica Houston, as always, plays a great villainess as the evil step mother! She's so great at being mean without getting ugly. And I really would love to see Doug Scott in something else!

Her father was a traveler and as he was leaving one day, he had a heart attack on his horse and died.Danielle was then forced to live by herself with her new step-mother, the Baroness Rodmilla De Ghent (Anjelica Huston) and two step-sisters Marguerite and Jacqueline (Megan Dodds, Melanie Lynskey).As the years went on, Danielle was treated less and less like family and more and more like a servant. Meanwhile the Prince of France, Henry (Dougray Scott) is trying to escape an arranged marriage because he wanted to find true love.He soon finds that love in Danielle. However, he does not know the woman by that name. When they met, she was dressed as a countess and she gave the prince her mother's name, Nicole de Lancrét. The two live their relationship lie until one night when the truth is pulled out from beneath them.This movie is unlike any other Cinderella story because it is not a prince doing the ""saving"" of anyone. In this movie, Danielle comes to the prince's rescue a few times, and she also offers him advice and words of wisdom.Also unlike any other Cinderella story, the ""fairy godmother"" in this story is the famous French artist/inventor Leonardo de Vinci (Patrick Godfrey).I found this movie very well acted and directed, the costumes were beautiful and the way the Renaissance was captured was brilliant. Overall there was no disappointment other than the fact that since it is another Cinderella story and it followed the same story line, therefore making it a little predictable. However, predictability can be good.This movie is by far one of my all time favorites.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

It's not groundbreaking, and Drew Barrymore's accent is a bit unusual, but I can't help watching the film whenever it shows up on cable. As a realist since childhood, I appreciate this retelling of the Cinderella story with no magic fairy dust - the great Leonardo DaVinci uses his genius instead. And the script is wonderfully clever. But best of all, I love that Prince Charming gets to know Cinderella and falls in love with her for her brain (Marguerite the stepsister is actually more attractive, but the prince doesn't want a shallow wife.) I recommend anyone with a daughter encourage her to watch this early and often, to counteract the many messages she will receive that good men prefer external beauty and weakness in their mates.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

Interpretations by all actors are wonderful and those by Drew Barrymore and Dougray Scott are simply outstanding. Their feelings are so real and so intense that every time I watch the movie I find it hard to believe that they are not really in love with each other but just acting. Danielle's character is strong, determined, right but at the same time beautiful and delicate, often unpredictable; Henry's one is also determined, coherent, constantly in search of true values and fascinated by those who can live their lives intensively. There is no doubt they must belong to one another since they ""match in every way"" and would only reach the perfect love by living together ever after...

The story line is well paced and enjoyable, drawing you into Danielle's (Barrymore) plight.  The costumes, sets and entire feel of the movie feel very authentic and are highly enjoyable.  Dougray plays Prince Henry (Prince Charming) well, adding just enough arrogance and heart to make him thoroughly likable.  There is enough action for the guys, although they may be shocked to find themselves rooting for our lovely heroine!

I have always been very romantic on where I have also dream of a prince and still waiting for one. Isn't great to love someone with out boundaries? We all look for a twin soul who which you would like to share the real you with one another. It is just a great movie. I believe that Drew Barrymore gave life to that love we all would like to feel for one day for someone an impossible love combined with pain and real truth of the heart. All of our realities we live through romantic movies are created by dreams and hopes but we can make it happen by just letting go and accepting one another in our future dreams.

I have to point out tho; Leonardo Da Vinci died 6 years before Thomas Moore Published the book Utopia; So Da Vinci shouldn't have been alive at all during the story line...The writer had to break the time line to use both the book and the artist at the same time...Utopia was published in 1525 while Da Vinci died in 1519...even with this inconsistency, I adore the movie...The story would fall apart without lines drawn from Utopia; while Da Vinci added charm that makes the story more charming than it would be without him...I can see why time had to be suspended in everafter...",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

Drew Barrymore is such a brilliant actor and all the emotion that she shows is really quite stunning. The plot unfolds quite nicely, bringing happiness, sadness, triumph, sorrow, love, hatred, cruelty, beauty and all the mixed emotions the 16th century could bring. And this is not only a sob story, there is humor, history and morals too. Not to mention some sword fighting for the boys.

My favorite scene is when Drew and the prince are playing rock-scissors-paper that leads to a kiss, ultimately interrupted by the gypsies. My second favorite moment is when Drew tells the price that it was unfair because he knows her weakness(books), but she didn't know his. His answer was simply, ""I should think that would be obvious"", then humbly looks at her. *faint*I go rent this movie whenever I want to surround myself with romanticism.

She does not take orders from her step mother, and the writer simply just adds the fact in, ""oh, yeah, and lets throw in the slipper thing at the end"" Its just an wonderful story all in all, and I watch it almost dayly..

The film had a really warm feeling to it and the soundtrack i thought was really relaxing in which resulted in being my video for Sunday rest every week. I thought the characters were great and the choice of sisters (actresses) was brilliant. Drew Barrymore was a brilliant girl to pick as i wouldn't consider her to be the best looking actress in the industry but that is what made her who she was in the film. Although she did always sound as if she was gonna cry each time she spoke as my brother commented! Angelica Housten as always was brilliant as the evil stepmother ans she never looks any older in any film that she does- i hope i look that good at her age!I also thought that the clothing in the film was absolutely gorgeous especially the dress that Dannelle wore in the masque. great viewing would recommend to anyone!,Ever After - A Cinderella Story

I have noticed though that they edited it incorrectly. If you pay close attention to the part where Danielle is flying the kite and Henry rides up and talks to Gustave she lets go of the kite. Now you would think that Maurice would find the kite after she let it go not before she even was flying it.Although this is a wonderful fairy tale and one Adult ""kids"" can enjoy I feel as if I am being taken back to a different place and time with out the massive our human family faces today.I do believe though the end of the movie was the best, where the so called evil step-mother gets her just desserts.I bet there are a lot of people out there that feel like Danielle did before she married the Prince.

274,realovable,My all time favorite movie ever.,10,5 December 2013,"Ever After. A Cinderella Story.What an entertaining and magical movie. The main character Danielle (Drew Barrymore) is what drew me to the theater. I just love her charisma and charm. Unlike her girl next door norm she was very intriguing in this movie, playing an independent, strong headed, feisty peasant is a sharp contrast to anything I've seen her in before.While this story is supposed to be a version of Cinderella, it takes on twists of it's own. There is no fairy god mother. Instead there is a charming intellectual inventor Leonardo Da Vinci (Patrick Godfrey). Rather than two hideous step sisters there is one awful yet beautiful sister and one plain but kind sister. It holds true to the peasant falling in love with royalty and the prince coming to save her but this story tells so much more. The king and queen were given personality and the story gives much insight to the untold story and challenges in the life of a Prince. It helps that Prince Henry is played by a very eye catching and witty actor (Dougray Scott).Everyone loves a happy ending and this movie did not disappoint. The director built up the characters so well that you sob along with Danielle when Prince Henry pushes her away after learning the truth but then celebrate along with her when he comes to save her from the evil clutches of an adoring yet creepy wealthy man who purchases her from her step mother. As always Anjelica Houston played a wonderfully evil role and did it with class and maliciousness that only she could bring to the film.The writers, producers, directors and cast come together for the most triumphant Hollywood win since Casablanca. I have seen this movie a dozen times and I hope to watch it a dozen more. Two thumbs up doesn't seem to sum it up. I only wish I had more thumbs!",Ever After - A Cinderella Story

I especially like the relationship between the two main characters. I found it interesting that they chose to include ""Leonardo De vinci"" in the movie since he would never naturally be linked to this movie or the original.I also think that each member of the cast was chosen carefully and perfectly to fit each individual role in this outstanding movie.It's a must watch!!!!",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
276,audicappy,"Worth viewing, many times over.",9,30 March 2015,"Without a doubt, one of the best renditions of the 'Cinderella' fable. It is a story of love, devotion, loyalty, and, yes, betrayal. Ultimately, it is redemption and forgiveness that come to the fore, with Prince Henry finally realizing who his life's match truly is and Danielle, who forgives the prince for his egregious reactionary behavior.I particularly liked the 'modern' nuances to the fairy-tale magic: Leonardo Da Vinci as the surrogate fairy godmother (genius in lieu of magic dust and spells), and Danielle's childhood friend and confidante Gustave (a nod to Disney's Gus-Gus), as well as her servant friends Paulette, Louise, and Maurice (rounding out Disney's mice friends).One interesting aspect of the film that impressed me was that not all of the 'evil' characters were that. Films that make villains linear and two-dimensional are just boring. That the baroness showed an all-too-brief vulnerable, human side gave her an added dimension that has always been missing the other iterations. Also that stepsister Jacqueline turned out to be a secret ally was a very clever plot twist to the third act.However, I would have given a different punishment for the stepmother and her nasty Marguerite: 'compensation' (in the amount of 20 gold FF apiece) and banishment to the Americas...

It brings a sense of hope that there really is true love out there, and that when you least expect it, it will come into your life. This movie is so inspiring and whisks you away into a fairy tale world where true love consumes your entire being. It draws you into its world by getting you so emotionally attached to the characters and their roles and places in society.

278,echern79,"It is, after all, a love story.",10,24 June 2005,"I will first start off as saying that this is one of the best films I have seen. I watch it for the love story that it is and not for its historical accuracies. I think people need to remember that movies are made for entertainment not history lessons. If you want a history lesson read a history book.I enjoyed this movie because it does take you away from everyday life even if it is only for two hours,(which I could watch another two hours if they continued the story). I happily found that the Danielle's(Drew Barrymore) character wasn't your average Cinderella. She had more to her than good looks which today's society often only sees in a person. She was smart, well-read, and portrayed that to a prince no less, where as many girls would be a ball of giggles and have a ""look at me I'm pretty attitude"" that Margurete portrays. As for the prince,(Dougray Scott, who is just fabulous) I thought his character was refreshing. He based his decision not on looks, like many other fairy tales do, but on what she was on the inside. Also, they made his character even more human by showing his faults and weaknesses. I too would probably run out on a person who you just were told that she was engaged(cheating) and lied about who she was. I think any ordinary person would be just as angry. That makes his character one that you can relate to, because I'm sure not allot of people can relate to a person of royalty.Well, enough of my thoughts. I rate this movie a 10 out of a 10.

But it's so terrific to know that if my daughter watches this, there is a character who doesn't have to wait for life to work out for her. Instead, it is she who is the catalyst who makes life work for her. What a fantastic role model for young women everywhere.

280,yahneh,Best Love Story To Remember Ever After,10,14 February 2006,"The story is universal, just like a story taken from the new testament of the bible. Three elements are present in this movie: faith, hope, and love. Danielle is a humble god-fearing servant much like an Israelite woman from the past. I've seen lots of love and romance movies but when it comes to morality this one is an exceptioncharacters don't end up in bed after falling in love in the first place. Movies and TV shows we have today are full of premarital sex plot, adultery, divorce, and etc Violence is minimal; therefore, it's a family film. Credit goes to George Fenton's music that added more heights in storytelling; Drew Barrymore's portrayal of being an underdog; Anjelica Huston's portrayal of an evil stepmother (she's not bad at all, though it will be different story if the director shows how Danielle was lashed like Christyou will truly hate her). Dialogues are great and characters know how to act their part, and Andy Tennant directed this film in a beautiful way (some flaws but overlooked).

281,mejtmarion,A Teenagers Point of View on this Cinderella Tale,10,12 December 2005,"SN-19 In Ever After bold colors symbolize status because the dress that the courtiers wear are bright reds and greens and the peasants wore dim blues and yellows. This shows status because only the rich and or wealthy people could afford the bright colored clothes. Oddly enough Danielle's dress at the end is white and the men wear dim colors.I have seen this movie a million times. This time I watched by myself in my bedroom. The first time I watched this movie was when I was eight years old with my grandmother in her living room. She told me that if a man treated me less then the prince then he wasn't good enough for me. That is why I am dating Spud.The dresses that the courtiers wear are bright reds and greens. They dress in extremely bright colors and voluptuous clothes. They wore low cut clothes that exposes cleavage that no one really wanted to see. They would wear extremely heavy jewelry that looked like ridicules children's fake jewelry that you would get from a cracker jacks box. You would even see them wearing pastel colors yet they were bright. They would fight with the suppliers on the prices if they were too high and they dress wasn't very bright or bold. They also wore brooches that were as big as an apple.The dresses that the peasants wore were extremely dim colored. They looked like spare material that you would find in the back of a Salvation Army storage room that was musty, moldy, and moth-eaten and had probably been there since the 1980's. They are lightly colored and look extremely faded. Even when they would dress up the dresses were a faded color. The peasants work clothes were even worse, they were moth-eaten and nasty. I believe that they were nasty colored because their masters bought them and didn't feel like spending much money on them so they got the cheapest things that they could find. The only time a peasant would wear a brooch was when they were going to a party and even then they were very small brooches.Oddly enough the dress that Danielle wears to the ball is white. So it is kind of bold and dim at the same time so we do not know what she is exactly feeling. The other thing is that the men in this movie wear dim colors.Good movie I loved it so much. Enjoy.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
282,thea_rose_88,Ever After,9,15 December 2005,"Shades of Character In Ever After warm and cool colors was exceptionally symbolic. Jacqueline and Danielle wore cool colors, portraying them as pleasant, sweet, and caring, while Marguerite and the Baroness wore warm colors giving them an aura of cruelty, wickedness, and threat. To contrast these colors, Leonardo da Vinci was always wearing white, characterizing him as pure, serene, and godly. My first experience leading up to watching this film was when I saw Cinderella for the first time at a very young age. I then watched Ever After, a modern portrayal of the fairy tale, as a sixth grader with my mom. Since then I have probably watched it fifty times but on September 29th I saw it with new eyes: film student eyes.Jacqueline and Danielle (Cinderella) were always seen in sweet, cheerful, cool colors, whether they are sparkly and grand or just plain old blue. These colors make them fade into the background, especially when they are around others in warm colors, and it is their smiles and personalities that make them stand out. This pattern of beauty incognito can be traced up until the very end of the movie when the audience is shocked as Danielle wears red, to symbolize her change in character and status. In this scene alone positions are reversed and the devious Baroness and Marguerite wear blue. One example of this is when Danielle and Jacqueline are wearing very similar dresses and Jacqueline is bandaging Danielle's back after she has been whipped by the baroness. This scene marks a drastic change in Jacqueline's character in that she has embraced her mother's favoritism of Marguerite, and turns around to find a friend in her stepsister. Another scene that portrays this contrast is that of Danielle wearing her mothers light blue gown as she goes to court and buys back her friend Maurice who was sold by the baroness. This was the first time that Danielle displayed an open selflessness and even in her cool, often unnoticed color she stood out as a charming, passionate individual. On their way to the mask ball, Marguerite wears a brilliant red and the Baroness a dusty maroon. These colors present quite the contrast to Jacqueline's ordinary blue and Danielle's ragged gray dress. Although we can tell that Jacqueline is above Danielle in this scene, it is also clear that she is not as high up as Marguerite.Marguerite and the Baroness wore warm colors giving them an image of aggressiveness, anger, and evil. One scene that demonstrates this is when Marguerite brings the queen a rosary telling her that she dropped it on the way out, this of course is a deceitful lie. She is put into a bright red and among all the blue and earth tones to make her stand out like a sour thumb. The mise en scene in this frame was also very centered on the spoiled Marguerite. She is placed in the middle of the frame in her bright red while around her avid churchgoers swarm out in their blues, greens, and purples. The Baroness herself is always wearing black or very dusky shades of shadowy colors. Adding to her clothing the actor herself has jet black hair and pasty white skin. This extreme contrast of dark on white makes her look frail and all the more frightening. The scene when the baroness and her daughters arrive at Danielle's home presents a nice picture of these colors. The baroness steps daintily out of the carriage in her elaborate black gown and is followed by little Jacqueline in blue and Marguerite in her usual red. The feelings of fear, intimidation, and evil are all suggested by the vivid colors worn by these characters. To say that the fairy godmother was omitted from this interpretation would be an outright lie. In Ever After we are given Leonardo da Vinci, who is always seen in white. He is truly the one who saves Danielle, giving her the wings she needs to fly. It is simple to make the connection between da Vinci and Christ, and it is his serene white that triggers the imagination. In one scene he walks out to Danielle in his floating shoes and proclaims her an angel. This scene sticks very firmly in the mind. The cinematographer gave a shot of the whole scene from water level. We can see da Vinci dressed from head to toe in his white robes and Danielle floating along in her blue and white. This amazing shot demonstrates da Vinci's ability to go out of the reach of the human mind and help a soul lost and in need of guidance. In yet another scene da Vinci saves Danielle from missing the Mask Ball by opening the door that she was locked in. He is immediately praised, though he is very modest in responding, ""yes, I shall go down in history as the man who opened the door."" Da Vinci is everything a girl could ask for in a fairy godmother and more, for you see, he is god.Ever After is a wonderfully put together reproduction of Cinderella that is perfect for girls who need a little escape back to childhood.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
283,jkbrende,Not Drew's #1 fan...loved the movie anyway.,9,13 February 2006,"Yeah, I knew there was a reason that Cinderella was my all-time favorite fairy tale! The writer does a great job of changing the expectations that we already knew from the popular tale. Knowing the premise of the story, he was still able to keep me involved enough to want to know HOW they would arrive at the point of 'happily ever after'. Drew was surprisingly likable (as I said in the title...I'm not much of a fan of hers) and she gave the pauper-like character much needed soul. I also thought Angelica Huston did a fantastic job as the Stepmother because in the original tale, I remember her as just 'mean'. But in this story, I actually felt moments of softened humility from a the known 'hardened' character. I rated this movie high because if given the opportunity...I would even watch it again. Way to go Drew!",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
284,NorrYtt,Romantic Retelling at its best,9,10 January 2006,"I assume all have seen this movie. If you haven't, go see it now.I am a single mid-twenties male and ""Ever After"" is my favorite romantic comedy, which is normally an unappealing genre for my demographic. I would vote for ""Ever After"" over any Rambo/Stallone flick for entertainment value for one night.Everything about Ever After is well done to excellent. Acting, costumes, plot twists, humor, dialog, scenery, music ... everything. This movie's ending is extremely satisfying, where everyone gets what they deserve. In short, the movie is well-executed entertainment.Upon further viewings, you begin to notice things, both good and bad. You see the Baroness's hurtful gaze at Danielle as August dies, Jacqueline's conflicts that almost parallel Danielle's, Margueritte's jaw dropping upon seeing Princess Danielle, and how Le Pew isn't really a bad guy for recognizing the beauty, radiance, and spirit inside Danielle that everyone else is blind to, only for his methods of approach.But, unfortunately, you also notice some bad things. There are factual and historic flaws, some less-than-perfect accents and dialog, and some not-completely believable events between the characters, with varying scales of forgiveness depending on the critic. However, remember that this is a retelling of a magic-filled bedtime fairy tale. If you are unable to suspend your disbelief for these overlook-able quirks in a movie, you probably like the original Cinderalla tale too much or too little and do not enjoy many movies for entertainment's sake.Danielle is not the most physically attractive character, that being 'Margueritte Francious Louise of the House of Ghent', but she outshines everyone as the most beautiful character, doing her common birth father and legendary mother proud. Leonardo Da Vinci plays the Fairy Godmother, having his fabled intelligence and artistry adding literally visual sparks to the movie, yet his dialog makes him the 'no bull-crap' character, which allows him to remind the prince to stop being a prince and Danielle to stop being Danielle and recognize they are a man and woman in love.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
285,sofiaskobla,feminist fairy tale,7,21 March 2017,"This tale is old as time and we all know it. Someone is sure that 'Cinderella' came to us from Egypt, where such legend took place in ancient times, but I think that every nation sooner or later created its own Cinderella's story. That's why there are so many interpretations. The plot of this fairy tale is very simple in comparison with the plot ""Snow White"" or ""Sleeping Beauty"", but the main thing is that, apart its ""magic aspect"", if it can be removed, the story could and can take place in real life. The interpretation which we analyze, the movie ""EverAfter"" (1998), directed by Andy Tennant, up to the handle, does not conclude this ""magic aspect"". Let's take the classic image of Cinderella. Scheherezade fight for her life telling fairy tales, Snow White becomes almost a mother to the seven dwarfs. And what does Cinderella do? (Sleeping Beauty doesn't count, she's sleeping all the time). She's been terrorized by her step- mother and sisters without any opposition, doing all nasty job. All the success in her life belongs to magic and her god-parent, she is passive. In Tennant's version there are no fairy and carriage-pumpkin, Cinderella doesn't need to be saved. She loves reading (her favorite one is ""Utopia"" by Thomas More). She's really worried about social injustice (she rescues one of the servants from the exile, and constantly shows the prince how far the royal family and common people are), so we can tell that she has a burning sense of just deserts. Also she's physically strong, she knows how to fight (she rescues the prince (!) from the gypsies, and rescues herself from the slavery without any help from prince). It's unbelievable for classical patriarchal fairy tale world, where every heroine patiently waits for rescuing by some gentleman. So without a doubt this is a feminist reinterpretation, in the first place. Any old fairy tale that we know begins with the words ""once upon a time"". It means that setting is indefinite. This movie's setting is definite – France of XVI century, Francis I is a king. His son Henri (in the future - Henri II) has an opportunity to choose the bride by himself. The father gives him three days, and all the events happen just then. Also among the characters acts Leonardo Da Vinci. What concerns a historicity of the movie, there are enough clashes with real events. Costumes tell us that it's something like 1516. ""Utopia"" was written just in 1516. But our heroine read this book in her childhood with a dad, about 10 years ago. ""Mona Lisa"" dates from 1519, so how characters could read Thomas More and observe Da Vinci's working process at the same time? The next thing is Henri, who was born only in 1519. Henri II got engaged with Ekaterina Medichi in 1533 - so no servants, no Spanish princesses, as you can see. Also in one scene we can see fireworks. Really? In XVI century? This story is quite detailed, we know more about characters, we see more development in Henri and Danielle's (Cinderella's name) relationships (not just fallen in love overnight). There is a problem of class inequality reflected. So we have volume characters, which don't seem as cardboard ones. One of the daughters, Jacqueline, for example, helps her half-sister. Even prince in the beginning is not so perfect, because he's quite arrogant and takes his position for granted. It's really fascinating to look after development of characters, watching them under the other angle.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
286,diz96,Ever After is one of my favorite movies!,10,8 October 2005,"This movie is definitely a good change from the original Cinderella movie that I watched as a child. This is a more grown-up version. It really shows a true romantic story. If you don't like Cinderella, watch this and see if the changes in this movie make it better for you.I really love this movie so much that I am doing an essay on it in my literature class for college. I just hope that I make a good grade on it in order to pass my class with an 'A'. If you like this movie, you may also like ""A Walk to Remember"" with Many Moore. It is a good romantic story like this one, but with a different ending, of course.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
287,abrowning_504,It is beautiful.,10,26 October 2005,"This is one of my favorite movies. It takes the classic fairy tale to a new level. It is full of depth. It is beautifully acted. The emotions are clear, and there is just enough humor. The one liners are full of wit. It is a rather girlie movie though. It will make you smile and want to cry at the same time. The king and queen shine. I particularly like the fact that the prince has a more defined role in this movie than in the original story. He seems more human instead of just Prince Charming. Drew Barrymore is an incredible Cinderella. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who wants to see a classic romance. You will not be sorry.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
288,sgiezen,Nope,1,9 May 2020,"I hated it.
The characters were just really weird to me and sometimes came across as out of character.

Drew Barrymores acting was great but the rest just kinda sucked.",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
289,justine_dancer,The Best Cinderela Story,10,15 December 2005,"SN-19 In Ever After bold colors symbolize status because the dress that the courtiers wear are bright reds and greens and the peasants wore dim blues and yellows. This shows status because only the rich and or wealthy people could afford the bright colored clothes. Oddly enough Danielle's dress at the end is white and the men wear dim colors. I have seen this movie a million times. This time I watched by myself in my bedroom. The first time I watched this movie was when I was eight years old with my grandmother in her living room. She told me that if a man treated me less then the prince then he wasn't good enough for me. That is why I am dating Spud. The dresses that the courtiers wear are bright reds and greens. They dress in extremely bright colors and voluptuous clothes. They wore low cut clothes that exposes cleavage that no one really wanted to see. They would wear extremely heavy jewelry that looked like ridicules children's fake jewelry that you would get from a cracker jacks box. You would even see them wearing pastel colors yet they were bright. They would fight with the suppliers on the prices if they were too high and they dress wasn't very bright or bold. They also wore brooches that were as big as an apple. The dresses that the peasants wore were extremely dim colored. They looked like spare material that you would find in the back of a Salvation Army storage room that was musty, moldy, and moth-eaten and had probably been there since the 1980's.

290,carly73,simply beautiful,10,9 February 2014,"Now, I'm a sci fi girl and there are very few 'chick flicks' that I have watched and loved, this however is surprisingly different. I have to say this is one of my favourite all time films. The characters are wonderful and perfectly played by the strong cast. I laugh every time I watch Danielle 'pick up' prince henry to save him from the gypsies and cry when Danielle arrives at the ball and says ""just breathe"" as her world is about to be crushed. It's the best version of the Cinderella story with a modern twist I have seen. I think I have watched this film a thousand times and will probably watch it a thousand more. Definitely worth a watch no matter what movie genre you're into!",Ever After - A Cinderella Story
