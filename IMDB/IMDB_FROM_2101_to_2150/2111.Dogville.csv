0,SnoopyStyle,extremely experimental,4,25 June 2016,"It's Depression era Dogville which lies at the end of the road to an abandoned silver mine in the Rocky Mountains. Tom Edison (Paul Bettany) hears a gun shot and then finds Grace (Nicole Kidman) on the run from some gangsters. Tom hides her in the mines and then tries to convince the town to protect her. Most are skeptical and Grace does chores for the people. They eventually accept her into their town but the ugliness eventually grows.This is a highly experimental theatrical experience. The set is more like a play. The buildings have no walls and things are often represented by written labels on the ground. It sets the movie feeling fake. I also don't like the constant narration. This is something deliberate which detracts from the enjoyment. It accentuates the fakeness of this morality play. It's also way too long. The good aspect is Kidman and the other great actors. In addition, the movie has a point and it makes it with surety. This is an unique film and not an enjoyable one.",Dogville
1,claudio_carvalho,"Unforgettable Bitter Play About a Town, Which Did Not Deserve To Be On the Map, and Its Disgusting Dwellers",10,7 July 2004,"On the Great Depression, the fragile and beautiful Grace (Nicole Kidman) arrives in Dogville, a small town in Colorado, escaping from the mob. Tom Henson (Paul Bettany), a young local man, welcomes and introduces her to the distrustful community. They decide to vote whether she could stay with them or not. After a brief meeting, they decide to lodge her for fourteen days, when they could judge her behavior and come up to a final decision. Meanwhile, she should perform some small jobs for them in a sort of retribution, receiving a symbolic payment. Later, the police come to the town with some pictures of her, informing she was a missing person. The vulnerable Grace becomes a slave of the community, being used by the locals in the most sordid and cravenly way. The conclusion of the story is spectacular. Two days ago, I started seeing this long unusual movie, indeed a filmed play. It surprised me in the first moment, but a friend of mine told me that this movie was a sort of 'love it' or 'hate it' film. Yesterday, I finished watching the DVD and actually it is one of the best stories about human exploitation and pay back I have ever seen. In some moments, the unfair misery of Grace recalled me Victor Hugo's Jean Valjean. It is amazing the tendency of the human race, when having some kind of power, to exploit those who need. The lack of scenarios or special effects highlights the stunning performance of the cast in a very original screenplay. This film is a great homage to the theatrical world and for great actors and actresses. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): 'Dogville' ('Dogville')",Dogville
2,classicsoncall,"""If there's any town this world would be better without, this is it.""",8,19 April 2018,"It probably won't dawn on you what the film maker is trying to say in ""Dogville"" until well into the picture, and even then I think there's a wide range of interpretation possible. For me, it began to click when the town citizens began doubling their demands of Grace (Nicole Kidman) to do more work for less pay. But the 'taking advantage' didn't stop there, as most of Dogville's men folk began extracting their pound of flesh from her, in a manner of speaking. Perhaps the one person who violated Grace the most however, at least in my estimation, was Vera (Patricia Clarkson), who destroyed the only physical possessions Grace held dear while making her watch and challenging her not to cry. The symbolism of the chain is glaring, as Grace becomes a prisoner to the whims of Dogville's citizens with no hope of escape unless an outside force should intrude to coerce them into facing their inhumanity. The idea that the scenario presented was all a test designed by Grace and her father (James Caan - the unnamed Big Man) was something I thought about as the Big Man's thugs were given the go ahead to destroy the town. At last willing to face the truth about society's inhumanity, Grace participates in it's demise by personally shooting Tom (Paul Bettany), while asserting that ""Some things you have to do yourself"".I wasn't quite sure how to take this film when it started out. For a while my disappointment with the excessive voice over narration and minimalist sets began to get real irritating. But after some time, the story took on the quality of a slow motion car wreck that one just has to take a good long look at to be sure nothing's missed. It's not the kind of movie I'd think of recommending to anyone though; much of the dialog is dense and even though there's a lot going on, it feels at times like things are standing still. And except for Nicole Kidman's character, almost all the rest seem static in their devotion to themselves. This is definitely not a picture for everyone, and something I just thought about that's kind of funny, for many viewers a good alternate title for the movie might have been 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'.",Dogville
3,gavin6942,Lars von Trier or Wes Anderson?,7,3 February 2015,"A woman on the run from the mob (Nicole Kidman) is reluctantly accepted in a small Colorado town. In exchange, she agrees to work for them. As a search visits town, she finds out that their support has a price. Yet her dangerous secret is never far away...Not knowing any better, viewers might think this was the work of Wes Anderson. Well, at least until some of the darker moments. This is Lars von Trier, possibly among the greatest directors working in the world today... a man who pushes the envelope even when we would rather he leave that envelope alone.The cast is impressive, but the real treasure is the set. Wow. This could be a play, the way it is set up, and indeed that is part of its charm. Can the residents see through their invisible walls?",Dogville
4,jboothmillard,Dogville,7,23 April 2007,"From the director of The Idiots, Lars Von Trier (nominated the Cannes Film Festival Golden Palm award for this) is an inventive and stylised film that really challenges you imagination. All buildings and landmarks are suggested by outlines, sound and props on a single sound stage (no real sets), which is the town of Dogville, based in the Depression era. Basically, Grace Margaret Mulligan (Nicole Kidman) arrives in the isolated town on the run from gangsters, led by The Big Man (James Caan). After some persuasion Tom Edison (Paul Bettany), the town decide to help her hide, and in return she works for them, even if they ""don't need help"". As time goes by, and they get to know her, searches are going through the town, and the people have suspicions and assumptions of poor Grace, and she finds out the hard way that goodness is relative. But she does have a dangerous secret, and the gangsters do eventually find her. Also starring Harriet Andersson as Gloria, Lauren Bacall as Ma Ginger, Jean-Marc Barr as The Man with the Big Hat, Blair Brown as Mrs. Henson, Patricia Clarkson as Vera, Secretary's Jeremy Davies as Bill Henson, Ben Gazzara as Jack McKay, Bruce Almighty's Philip Baker Hall as Tom Edison Sr., Forrest Gump's Siobhan Fallon as Martha and narrated by John Hurt. Very good!",Dogville
5,Tweekums,Something very different,9,4 March 2010,"Dogville is the sort of film the viewer will either be engrossed in from start to finish or they will want to turn off after a few minutes... thankfully I was in the former group. As the film opens it becomes apparent that it is something very different; in a time when many films have stunning locations or large CGI landscapes this goes the other way and has virtually no scenery being filmed on a stage where locations are labelled but not actually shown; so a house will just be white lines drawn on the stage. The only props we see are those that that are essential to the plot.Set in a small hamlet in the Rocky Mountains where nothing much happens until one day Grace, a beautiful young woman arrives; she is trying to get away from a group of gangsters. The townsfolk agree to let her stay for two weeks, and at the end of that time they will vote on whether she can stay; if one person says no she must leave though. During that time she offers to help them out in various ways. At first they say they don't need help but soon she is doing little things for all of them and at the end of the two weeks they vote to let her stay. Not long afterwards a policeman comes looking for Grace, the people once again decide to let her stay although as time passes the little things they don't really need help with grow to fill most of her time. Later the police man returns and says Grace is wanted for a bank robbery; even though they know she could not have committed they crime they expect her to do more and more to let her stay. After being raped by one of the men she tries to leave Dogville but the person she paid to take her away betrayed her and returns her to the town where the people chain her up to prevent her escaping. At this point they give up all pretence of being decent and treat her like a slave as well as all but one of the men raping her. That one claims to love her but when she declines his advances he contacts the gangsters who where looking for her all that time ago. What he does not know is that that gangster was Grace's father and when he gets there he just wants to bring Grace into his business and while she is initially willing to forgive the townspeople she soon decides something must be done so that they can never do to another person what they did to her... after she is finished the town's name is chillingly appropriate: the only living creature left in the township is Moses the dog.When I watched this I'd already seen its sequel; ""Manderlay"" so wasn't sure how I'd like seeing a different actress in the role of Grace as Bryce Dallas Howard was great in the later film, I needn't have worried though as Nicole Kidman was equally good. Strangely the open set managed to make the town of Dogville seem very claustrophobic, nothing was done that everybody doesn't know about making everybody complicit in her suffering. While Grace is the centre of the film that doesn't mean Nicole Kidman is the only actor that gets to show off her acting skills all of the cast perform well, especially Paul Bettany who plays Tom, the man who claims to love Grace but who does as much as any of the others to keep her there. Mention must also go to John Hurt who narrates the story and obviously to Lars von Trier who had the vision to create such a different film. I'd certainly recommend giving this film a go; just don't expect it to be like anything you've seen before; unless you've seen Manderlay.",Dogville
6,wes-connors,Something's Rotten in Dogville,3,10 January 2010,"The film ""Dogville"" is told in nine chapters and a prologue, totaling about three hours. It is a ""sad tale"" about a typical small town ""in the Rocky Mountains in the US of A,"" according to the significantly British narrator John Hurt. The sets are done in the sparse style of Thornton Wilder's stage play ""Our Town"". The town's buildings are simply drawn as chalk shapes on a giant board. Props that are necessary are included, like a bench to sit on. But, most are left to your imagination. Paul Bettany (as Illuminating Tom Edison Jr.) is the most important character introduced in the story until Movie-star beautiful Nicole Kidman (as Amazing Grace) arrives in town, apparently running way from gangsters. She needs a place to hide from the men chasing her, and the relatively isolated ""Dogville"" looks like good place to hide. The townspeople vote about helping Ms. Kidman hide from her pursuers. Mr. Bettany falls in love with Kidman, and is he her biggest supporter. Stellan Skarsgard (as Chuck) is hardest to convince, but he comes around. Bettany proposes Kidman pledge to work like a dog in each ""Dogville"" home. A ""shocking revelation"" occurs late in the film.Profoundly obvious, this would've worked as a Wilder-styled variation of ""The Lottery"" for PBS-TV, with a less wobbly-camera.*** Dogville (5/19/03) Lars von Trier ~ Nicole Kidman, Paul Bettany, John Hurt, Stellan Skarsgard",Dogville
7,michaelRokeefe,Combination of drama and tragedy.,6,5 April 2006,"Nicole Kidman plays Grace, a beautiful fugitive, that finds her way to a small isolated town named Dogville. She is hiding from her gangster father(James Caan)and is befriended by Dogville's self appointed spokesman Tom Edison, Jr(Paul Bettany). Grace ends up working an hour a day for each Dogville family in return for her shelter. As the stakes grow higher for knowledge of her whereabouts, the town decides to double her work hours; if that is not enough she is raped and then becomes the victim of aggravated sexual assault from about every man in town...except Tom, whom she has fallen in love with. Grace is then forced to make a major decision about how she is going to live the rest of her life. She makes sure that Dogville will never again be the same.At times this movie lumbers on its way to the finale two minutes short of three hours. Written and directed by Lars von Trier, DOGVILLE makes use of a noble and interesting cast: Lauren Bacall, Ben Gazzara, Stellan Skarsgard, Patricia Clarkson, Chloe Sevigny and Blair Brown. John Hurt narrates and at times gets annoying. This movie just seems not meant for everyone...but after watching you definitely know you have seen something with substance.",Dogville
8,jotix100,Arrogance,8,5 May 2004,"Director Lars Von Trier brings his slanted take of an America of the 30s as a metaphor of what is wrong with the country. He brings his own agenda to a place he has only known in his mind, because the fact remains he has never set foot in the country!The idea of setting the film in a sound stage seems original at first, but then it works against it. The limitations of the setting don't add much to what is happening, but that's Mr. Von Trier's own interpretation of how he wants to tell this morality play.The story of Grace, the destitute woman, who shows herself one day in Dogville, has a lot of interpretations and meanings. At first, she gains the trust of the citizens; they let her stay. The middle section is how Grace gives her best to the town, only to be punished and enslaved by the same people she tried to help before. This in turn, leads to the betrayal by Tom, the man who loved her, to sell her to the unknown gangster that turned out to be Grace's own father.This film could use some trimming. The acting is first rate. Nicole Kidman, as Grace, is at the top of her craft. She is brilliant in a role that is tailor made for her. Also good is Paul Bettany. His Tom goes a deep transformation. Chloe Sevigny plays Liz with conviction. It's very hard to single out anyone because the ensemble acting is first rate.At the end, while the credits are rolling, the director decides to show a slide picture presentation about a corrupt America for all of us to see as we leave the theater. Mr. Von Trier will not be filming in this country any time soon, but a trip to a Dogville, USA, is in order for him to put his perceptions in order.",Dogville
9,Doylenf,Why must a morality tale be so hard to digest???,4,19 November 2006,"The Thornton Wilder OUR TOWN approach to staging a small town cross-section of townspeople using a stylized approach (few props and bits of scenery), has been used again sixty or more years later for DOGVILLE. However, I found the results stagnant and artless, instead of artful.No doubt the pseudo-intellectuals will pounce on this sort of disagreement and proclaim the film as some kind of masterpiece. It all makes as much sense as the seven figurines in Ma Ginger's window.Dialog is supposed to move a plot forward--but not in this case. It crawls through so much pretentious prattle in examining why NICOLE KIDMAN should stay or leave Dogsville that it is stultifying in its emptiness.To put it kindly, Kidman's performance adds nothing to her stature as an actress. Her work can best be described as tentative. PAUL BETTANY, on the other hand, rises to the occasion with an earnest performance as her best friend in the village.The bareness of the staging is equal to the bareness of the plot. Very disappointing to watch people like LAUREN BACALL (totally wasted as Ma Ginger) and BEN GAZZARA (as the blind man) in such sketchily written parts.Summing up: Definitely not my cup of tea. Even morality tales should make their point by the time the story is halfway over. The over-the-top ending with the entrance of JAMES CAAN can only be described as deplorable.",Dogville
10,dbborroughs,You'll Either Love It or Hate It,6,19 March 2004,"The story of what happens when Nichole Kidman arrives in Dogville is either going to thrill you or strike you as one of the worst films of all time. There is no set to speak of, only lines on the ground so the film comes off as nothing more than a filmed stage play. And while John Hurt's narration adds a dimension of literary quality to the proceedings, proving this is probably a better movie to listen to then watch.The performances are uniformly excellent across the board and those wishing to see great acting should see this... ...but the movie goes on way too long and ends up being one of the most bleak films in recent memory. I'm not sure what the point of it all is and any ideas I did have got lost with the three hour running time.As I said you'll either love it or hate it - Me I'm in the five percent of people who'll be on the fence. 6 out of 10.",Dogville
11,lastliberal,I think the world would be better without Dogville.,8,27 July 2007,"Sometimes a movie is hard to watch. This is one of those times. You are slapped in the face with a reality that maybe we are not as civilized as we make out to be.Some say this film is anti-American. I disagree. It is anti-human. We tend to put ourselves up on a pedestal as being so much better than all the other animals, when, in reality, the base instincts that we have in common with the animals are just below that surface.Nicole Kidman was outstanding in this film. She showed just the right range of emotion. She was supported by a great cast that included Paul Bettany and Lauren Bacall, as well as Ben Gazzara, Philip Baker Hall, Patricia Clarkson, Chloë Sevigny, Harriet Andersson, Jeremy Davies, Zeljko Ivanek, Blair Brown and James Caan.The minimalist set allowed us to focus on the actors and we were rewarded with great performances that showed deep down we will act to serve ourselves when our psyches are threatened.This was my first Lars von Trier film. I know I will have to see a couple more before I pass judgment, but he really showed me something here.",Dogville
12,grantss,Powerful and highly original,9,26 April 2018,"Grace is on the run from a criminal gang. She seeks refuge in the small town of Dogville, Colorado. The townspeople help her out, but their assistance comes at a price.Highly original story-telling from writer-director Lars Von Trier. The entire movie is shot on a basic stage. The entire town is there, with tape on the ground indicating buildings, walls and streets. A very basic setting for a powerful moral.As the story progresses you see Von Trier's vision - showing the worst instincts of humankind. This he does very successfully and poetically. It's almost Shakespeare-like, especially in how the story is resolved.Superb end-product, though I can see how the movie can be polarising. I am not generally into movies and directors who concentrate more on being arty than telling a good story. With the novel set, I can see how some people may find the movie pretentious. Personally I found it revolutionary, as it strips everything down to the bare minimum, prop-wise, having to rely entirely on character depth and story-telling. Quite the opposite of pretentious, as there is no style - it's all substance.",Dogville
13,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,An extremely honest exploration of humanity,10,16 February 2010,"I try to watch anything by Lars von Trier I can get to. He's an unconventional film-maker, and one of the too few who challenge what the medium is and what it can be, where the limits go. Yes; the houses in this are chalk outlines. It is a very bare set - at points it made me think of theater - and no, that does not make for a ""pretty"" movie. This isn't really meant to be a people-pleaser. It is quite brass, and delves into unpleasant themes. For the record, I don't see the reason(well, I see it, but I don't agree with it) for this being accused of being anti-American. What, because it's set there? The plot is engaging and involving from start to finish. While it is excellent, I'd say an excessive amount of emphasis has been placed upon the twist; this is about the journey, and not the destination(in spite of it being amazing). The characters and the interpersonal relationships are entirely credible and well-done. This is brilliantly cut, creating and maintaining the mood, and the cinematography, if limited, is marvelous, as well. The acting is flawless and impeccable. Even the children are astonishing. The script is impressive, and scenes and dialog are realistic. The well-written and rather verbal narration is used well and John Hurt is perfect in his delivery. Set during the 1930's in the US, a young woman on the run from the mob finds a small town, and this chronicles the developments that follow. Funny, tragic, cruel, deep and emotional. There is a lot of disturbing content including physical and psychological abuse, some violence(brutal in tone, if not in its depiction), and very infrequent mild language in this. The double-DVD holds an interesting selected commentary track(with the director), 7 compelling interviews & ""confessions"", four featurettes(three of which I will review on their individual pages here on the site), Cannes footage, a trailer and posters(apparently boasting no less than 198(!) minutes worth of documentaries). I recommend this powerful drama to mature audiences, not put off by the length(trust me, it's worth it, and this isn't boring at any time). 10/10",Dogville
14,ferguson-6,Shall I ring the bell?,8,18 April 2004,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Lars von Trier wrote and directed this fascinating study of human nature.  With the feel of community theatre, we witness how even the best intentioned ""good people"" can quickly assimilate to taking advantage of another person's weakness.  Paul Bettany (""A Beautiful Mind"") and Nicole Kidman are both outstanding in their lead roles. Kidman has truly developed into the Meryl Streep of her generation - and I don't say that lightly.  ""Moulin Rouge"", ""The Hours"", ""Cold Mountain"" and ""Dogville"" are 4 sterling performances that will stand the test of time.  As great as the leads are, the rest of the cast is every bit their equal.  How wonderful to see Ben Gazzara and Lauren Bacall (almost 80 years old!) each steal their scenes.  The always terrific Patricia Clarkson continues her string of perfect performances (""Pieces of April"",""The Station Agent"" ""Far from Heaven"") and there are just too many others to name, but trust me, you will recognize most faces and be touched by the amazing performances.  The basic stage set allows us to really concentrate on the character of the characters and feel their pain and experience their changes.  I truly LOVED the ending, but do not let anyone tell you much about the story before you see it.  You must go through the process with this story to gain the full effect.  This is an art house film so don't expect ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" or any other special effects.  The music, score and lighting combined with the exceptional performances are all the mood and setting this one needs.",Dogville
15,The_Void,A completely originally styled film! Wonders will never cease!,10,24 January 2005,"What does one make of Dogville? I can say, without risking speaking out of turn, that this is the most originally styled movie in the history of movies. The film starts by introducing us to the town of 'Dogville', which is basically just a lay out that consists of white lines on a black canvass. Naturally, I expected the film to switch to a more proper set once it started proper - but it doesn't! Flamboyant Danish director Lars Von Trier leaves us with just this very basic set, and I was expecting to start hating the film very quickly for that very reason. But this style only allows Von Trier to show what a talented artist he really is, as the lack of distractions allows him to put the focus on the acting and story, both of which are immense. The story is rich with themes of acceptance and retribution, while the entire cast - which consists of many smaller European stars - prove their worth by delivering it in a way that is engaging and thought provoking. We follow Grace (Nicole Kidman) who, while on the run from gangsters, stumbles into Dogville where the locals agree to take her in.at a price.I admire the audacity and bravery of Lars Von Trier for making this movie, which most people, frankly, would have laughed at if they heard the idea before seeing the movie. The movie clocks in at just less than three hours, but you honestly wouldn't believe it while watching. Von Trier has shown that all a movie needs to work is a strong story and some good actors to deliver it. Dogville is story telling at it's most basic as it is delivered with hardly any means other than dialogue and acting, and so requires a talented auteur to tell it, which it has in Lars Von Trier. The director has made many original and inventive films, and has gained quite a good reputation, of which this film only adds to. One thing that many people tend to think of movies these days is that there's no originality left, which is true to an extent, but my response to those people is simple - watch 'Dogville' and reconsider.",Dogville
16,zetes,"Brilliant filmmaking, but von Trier misses his mark a bit",9,29 August 2004,"A brilliant film, no doubt, although I think I prefer almost all of the other films I've seen by Lars von Trier. His work is always problematic, but he has such a mad genius that even something as questionable as Idiots (or, indeed, Dogville) succeeds even as it kind of fails. This is the story of a small town of little means in a remote area of the United States called Dogville. One day a young woman, Grace (Nicole Kidman), wanders in while being persued by gangsters. The townspeople are afraid of what might happen if they harbor her, but they like her and they decide to do so. But the thing is that they have something on her, and they own her. She depends on them, and they quickly begin taking advantage of her, and ruthlessly. She even tries to escape, but the town refuses to let go of its toy. It's a pessimistic and entirely misanthropic viewpoint, the cruelest situation that Lars von Trier has ever depicted (and that's saying something!), and I suspect that many will be sickened by it. To add injury to insult, the theme to which the director has been continually returning, the theme that upsets many, that of the suffering woman, is on full display here. Kidman is raped and later used as a sexual object, and the narrator of the film informs us that the men use her like a hillbilly uses a cow. After she tries to escape, she is fitted with a cowbell and tethered to a heavy wagon wheel.
The purported anti-Americanism in the film is strange, to say the least. It reminds me a lot of the way Zhang's Hero ended. That film veers towards nationalism very near the end, and it really doesn't follow, like the director had to do it but had no real interest in doing it. I'm sure Lars von Trier did have interest, however misguided, in making Dogville into an anti-American statement, but it just doesn't work. The credits play over numerous pictures of poor and homeless Americans, with David Bowie's `Young American' playing. What has this at all to do with Dogville? The story is set in the USA, but the same observations about human nature could be made about any people in any part of the world. I suspect that only a few elements would need to be changed to set the film in Denmark and it would not ring any more or less true, depending on whether or not you buy the moral of the story. But it is most certainly anti-American, as was Lars von Trier's previous film, Dancer in the Dark. But like Dancer in the Dark, Lars von Trier's observations about America ring false. There are plenty of gripes to be had with the US, and it would be very easy to make much more potent works of art that explore its faults, but neither Dancer nor Dogville make very effective statements about America. I've yet to see a European film that said anything substantive about the country that I live in. Well, whether or not Lars von Trier has skewed his target, I would never suggest that he hasn't produced something original and interesting, and he has definitely produced a film that will inspire discussion for years to come, and that's always worthwhile. Dogville will be a big candidate for repeated viewings, as I probably didn't take it all in on one viewing.",Dogville
17,Vincentiu,Ash of innocence,10,26 December 2006,"At first sight, ""Dogville"" is a Greek tragedy's variant. Same gods, same sin, same fatum. In fact, it is a story about human condition. About freedom and fear, trust and error, punishment and crime. And Grace is only a voice of a very subtle illusion. She is himself's victim, the sign of normal hope and normal waiting. A marble piece who discover the art of some sculptors. Lars van Trier presents the image of same world who lives in everyone. The movie is not a moralistic story, a faithlessness's exposure. It is a slice of reality, basic reality, without lights, speeches or gifts. In fact, only character in this film is the silence. Silence before the words, silence like mask, silence inside the looks. And that silence, soft, heavy, impure is the fruit of a great disappointed. Each character is a victim and her surrender's symbol is the ash of innocence who lives in final scene.",Dogville
18,KineticSeoul,Human nature and morality,7,12 February 2011,"This is a pretty original movie, mainly because of the setting and premise of it all. I personally didn't think it was a true achievement in the film-making medium, but it's still a compelling story although sort of dull at times. The movie is written pretty well though and the acting is pretty good for the most part. What made this movie stand out is how in Dogville there is no walls, in fact it's basically has invisible walls for the audiences that are watching but there is walls for the cast and they had to act like there is walls. Although there isn't any, but the characters had to act like there is a wall and goes along with there usual business in the movie. The movie is really long and the whole movie takes place in just one setting, so it may get a bit dull at times. Since the dialogue is sort of dry and so is the setting and the premise of it all, although it has it's originality to it. The movie is basically about human nature and morality and it's pretty engaging in some parts, I wouldn't highly recommend this film to anyone but the movie does has it's target audiences. A lot of the characters seemed one dimensional and there dialogue didn't go anywhere sometimes and without it, it would have at least shorten the movie to a decent length.7.3/10",Dogville
19,Buddy-51,audacious failure,3,18 January 2005,"Lars Von Trier's ""Dogville"" is ""Our Town"" for the clinically depressed, exploring the dark underbelly of rural Americana in ways that Thornton Wilder never even imagined. Like Wilder, Von Trier utilizes a fictional small town to reveal profound truths about human nature, although Von Trier's revelations are far more sinister and despairing than any Wilder came up with.Dogville is a sleepy little hamlet nestled high up in the Colorado Rockies. The simple folk there lead lives of humdrum monotony, undisturbed by the troubles and vicissitudes of the outside world. One day, a mysterious and beautiful young woman - allegorically named Grace - is found wandering in the town. When it is discovered that she is fleeing some mobsters, the townspeople reluctantly agree to hide her and let her become a member of their community. At first all goes well, with Grace winning over the hearts of the citizens and even bringing a measure of previously unknown joy into their lives. However, slowly the mood turns sinister, as the denizens begin to exploit, then sexually and psychologically abuse the delicate young woman. Von Trier makes the case that even the most seemingly benign, mild-mannered individual will, if given half a chance, lord it over someone who is weaker and more vulnerable than he is. The final hour of the film has much of the feel of Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery,"" as Grace becomes the expiatory sacrifice for the sinful folk who live in the town - until, that is, the tables are turned on them.Because the story is essentially a morality play and a parable, Von Trier has chosen to make the film on a stark sound stage, with chalk lines substituting for walls and only the barest minimum of décor suggesting an actual town. Only the sound effects - such as the opening and closing of invisible doors - is entirely realistic. (A TV movie version of ""Our Town"" in the 1970's utilized this same technique).Although, as a conceit, ""Dogville"" is intriguing enough in its early stages, after about the first hour or so - and it runs for almost three! - the movie begins to severely outstay its welcome. Once the novelty of the stage-bound approach wears off, we are left with a pretty silly story in which the characters act in ways that are not merely inscrutable but downright maddening. We begin to wonder what the point of it all is after awhile. If Von Trier is trying to say that small town Americana is really not all Norman Rockwell sweetness-and-light, that theme has been explored countless times before, and in works far less contrived and pretentious than this one. The tone of self-importance that permeates the film is reflected in the dividing up of the tale into nine ""chapters"" - replete with fancy title cards - and the use of a droning, hoity-toity narrator (more shades of ""Our Town"") whose main function seems to be to point out the obvious.As Grace, Nicole Kidman does an effective job portraying an essentially passive victim, although we spend most of our time wanting to see her deck all those sadistic idiots with whom she comes into daily contact. The other actors are fine as well, though such stalwarts as Phillip Baker Hall and the ageless Lauren Bacall are left hanging around in the background with not a whole lot to do.""Dogville"" is, I suppose, an audacious attempt at something different, and for that at least it should get some credit. But I doubt that most people will have the patience to see it through to the end.",Dogville
20,paul2001sw-1,"Imaginative, original, but unambiguous",6,16 May 2007,"The modern-day film-maker has a panoply of accumulated conventions, tricks and wisdom from the history of cinema to draw from; but perhaps the easy use of familiar techniques merely enables directorial laziness. Lars von Trier's methodoloy of film-making involves the creation of arbitrary constraints as a way of forcing freshness. Thus he formulated the ""Dogme"" creed for minimalistic movies; and in 'The Five Obstructions', he documented his attempts to persuade his friend Jorgen Leth to make the same film under film different, completely arbitrary, sets of restrictions. Now, in 'Dogville', he has basically restricted himself to filming a play. Often, filmed plays seem boring, just static, wordy movies, but von Trier has re-invented the concept of filming a play by eschewing physical realism and sticking to the minimalist sets, and sound effects, of budget theatre; but with a trick, for on a giant wall-less set, the entirety of the small town where the events of the story take place is in effect on camera permanently, so we see the townsfolk in the background while the drama centres on a single location. It's certainly distinctive, and the emphasis in filming is very much on the characters' faces, especially that of star Nicole Kidman, who shines luminously throughout the film.The story itself is a ""Lord of the Flies""-style parable of the depths to which humanity will sink, given appropriate circumstances. As ever with von Trier, there's a measure of gratuitous excess (though necessarily muted in its presentation), and also the strange decision to have the story heavily narrated. The narration moreover has a (deliberately) oddly comforting tone even when describing the worst atrocities; and more disappointingly, tells the viewer exactly what to think. The result is a beautifully constructed but fatally unambiguous drama: it may be subtle, but its relationship with the audience is not. It's also very long: in fact, I found it more absorbing as it progressed, but the early stages certainly drag, and emotionally it's dry compared with von Trier's other work.I'll finish with a couple of comments about how the film relates to the rest of von Trier's oeuvre. The degradation of women appears to be a recurring theme in his movies, perhaps unhealthily. It's also strange that he seems so keen to make movies about America, without actually ever having visited that country. But just as with his portrait of the west coast of Scotland in 'Breaking the Waves', his ability to create an country of the imagination that makes sense in itself and still connects to reality is outstanding. 'Dogville' is not wholly successful; but few directors can match von Trier for ambition and vision.",Dogville
21,dromasca,"Great theater, but is it great cinema?",8,18 April 2004,"I would not expect from Lars Van Tier a conventional movie. Since 'Kingdom' and 'Breaking the Waves' each of the director's movies was different, and his creative research and his lack of continuity are part of a great creator and innovator profile. So the fact that 'Dogville' is different did not came as a surprise to me.Actually the problem that I have with this movie is that it is too similar to another genre. If you are a theater fan, if your read and watched enough plays by Berthold Brecht or Henrik Ibsen, the formula used by Van Tier will seem very familiar to you. Yes, this looks exactly like filmed theatre. great theatre, original, strong, enrolled in the good way, as the two great masters of the social and moral theatre have defined it. Still, cinema has its own rules, and by cinema rules 'Dogville' misses being an enjoyable experience. It lacks both dream or realism which are at the basis of a cinema experience and it lacks the visual quality of a cinema work of art. It is also too long. What are we left with? A strong moral message, a sharp critic of the capitalist system, of the lack of sensitivity and the rule of mob that is hidden in the community life led by artificial concepts instead of human solidarity. We are also left with many questions =- do the characters deserve their end? is the film anti-American? these are left open intentionally, but a good piece of art needs not answer such questions.
Nicole Kidman's acting is superb.I wish I have seen this work on stage. As a film, it is hard to forget, but it lacks top cinema quality. 8 out of 10 on my personal scale.",Dogville
22,g-bodyl,Very........Interesting!,8,1 October 2013,"If there was a movie that would to provide a big split between critics and audiences, it would be this film Dogville. However, the contrast isn't as great as I thought it would be. But, this film is unlike any other film I have seen before. I always encourage experimental filmmaking and this is a prime example of it. The film is in play format and the town has no walls or doors suggesting that there are some philosophical themes in play. Each person would interpret this movie differently and that seems to be the goal of the filmmakers.Lars Von Trier's film takes place in the 1930's in a small, quaint town of Dogville which is seemed to be located somewhere in the American West. The citizens of Dogville are tested when they decide to take in a young lady on the run from some gangsters.This film is well-acted and that is also why the movie works, in my opinion. There are some stand-out performances by Nicole Kidman, Paul Bettany, Stellan Skarsgaard, and James Caan. These were the stand-outs, but the rest of the cast was magnificent as well.Overall, this is a great piece of experimental filmmaking. But however, the film is a bit too long and it could lose a half-hour or so. I know that people criticized this film for putting America in a bad spotlight, but then who doesn't? There are many themes to be taken away from this film, but I'll leave it to the viewers which themes the film is implying. I rate this film 8/10.",Dogville

This most unusual production is a cross between a stage production, an oral reading from a storyteller festival, and a movie. This brilliant, unique work has Nicole Kidman in one of her most memorable roles ever. The build up and the climax are beyond description as the emotions rip your innerself apart as the conflicting fear, happiness, suspicion, and anger are mix together and by the end of the movie its impossible to really explain what happened and what it means. I consider this film a masterful work of art...with solid acting (both film and stage) and the cinematography and camera work, and sound effects, direction are amazing and must have been quite complicated. This fusion of sight and sound - presents the audience with a new experience with new critical moral thoughts and raises questions of the most deepest kind.

25,Rodrigo_Amaro,Fantastical And Critical Story,10,30 August 2010,"In ""Dogville"" every action has a strange reaction, and the acts and thoughts are really like a boomerang: they always find a way to return to the place where it was thrown out. Nicole Kidman plays Grace, a woman running away from the mob who is reluctantly accepted in a small Colorado town named Dogville. In exchange, she agrees to work for them. But when the police starts to show up questioning the habitants of the town about her she finds out that their support has a price. Divided in 9 long parts (almost three hours of film) and a epilogue, and narrated by John Hurt in a bookish way, Lars von Trier's film is a great and original work of criticism, art, and perhaps of shocking realism despite the lack of scenarios might distract some viewers. ""Dogville"" the first part of a trilogy about the United States, is a concept film. There's a non subtle and powerful message towards acceptance, and how people are in America and their estranged behavior towards outsiders (the unknown you might call). But it's not just a critical film, it is a experience to be viewed, very different of everything you've seen. The director didn't built a set for the city; it's only a stage with chalk marks on the floor delimiting the spaces along with few objects on scene, and the actors were required to imagine/create the doors and walls for this fictional American city of the 1930's. I don't want to spoil the fun of viewing this masterpiece and I won't tell what happens with Grace during her stay in Dogville but I must say a few things about the aspects of the film that were harshly criticized or over viewed as prejudicial and/or controversial. This movie was called of Anti-American by some people and even reviewers. It is an Anti-American film? Not so much. It criticizes all the posture adopted by U.S. after the 9/11 attacks, making difficult the acceptance of foreigners in the country: A serious look towards other nations along with the eternal suspicious on other people acts. When Michael Moore showed us in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" the thinking of some Americans about people who don't live in their country and happens to be ""in one of those little town similar to Dogville"" they say to the camera how they receive foreigners with lots of suspicion. This is a general picture, the usual portrayal of all the Americans? I don't think so. After all there's good and bad in every one, in every nation, but the director/writer wanted to tell a story that took place in U.S., but it could be placed everywhere. An ensemble casting from around the world compounds the Americans of Dogville (Paul Bettany, Stellan Skarsgard, Zeljko Ivanek) and some American actors too (Lauren Bacall, Ben Gazzara, Jeremy Davies, Chloe Sevigny, Patricia Clarkson, Blair Brown, Philip Baker Hall). Every single performance in this movie is perfect, although some performers should have more time on screen, more dialogs also. The most notable performances comes from Kidman, Paul Bettany and Stellan Skarsgard (very strong and scary acting).The epilogue showing pictures of the poor people living in America mixed with the great song ""Young Americans"" by David Bowie (closing credits) is the highlight the summarizes the film, wonderful and shocking. By that time if you didn't get von Trier's idea or find the film boring you missed a huge deal and a great film. Excellent, excellent, excellent! 10/10",Dogville

27,Dr_Coulardeau,A sublime Nicole Kidman,10,28 January 2008,"A mysterious film in which everything is upside down. No setting really, in fact a nearly empty stage like in a minimalist dramatic production in some avant-garde theater. The only originality is that the camera can look down upon the stage from a higher position, which an audience cannot do. Of course too the camera can move around the stage. This is supposed to express a society that is upside down and besieged due to the depression. Depression in all directions: the mine is closed, there is no work for anyone, survival is the fundamental rule, autarky is the objective of everyday life. But that is not all. A female fugitive arrives one day in this dead mining community in the mountains preceded by the sound of gunshots and followed by a car that looks like a gangster's car, and it is. Yet the girl is hidden at first, then accepted, and then things turn sour. The film is about this slow transformation and revelation that human nature is not to be trusted. The girl is given some tasks in a friendly manner at first, and then little by little these tasks become an obligation that everyone expects. Thus the girl is transformed into a domestic slave. The next stage will be the progressive use of her body by all the men and the total hatred the women will feel and express for her. From being morally enslaved she will become physically enslaved with a chain and a flywheel attached to the chain itself attached to a metal collar. She becomes some kind of bitch or dog used by the villagers for their chores and impulses. The young would-be writer who protected her at first and declared is love at the beginning is also transformed from a rather kind and loving young man into a traitor who accuses her of a theft he had done himself, for her to escape it's true, but himself with his own hands. Then he will little by little consider her as an obstacle between himself and the village, hence an obstacle on his road of laziness and comfort. He will in the end call the gangsters to come and get her out of the village. On that level, simple people in a simple community hit by the depression, the least we can say is that good intentions and civilization are very superficial and very short-lived. But the worst is still to come. The gangsters come back of course. The girl is the daughter of the boss of the gang, and he gives her the responsibility, if she wants to come back with him out of this hell, to give the order to shoot everyone and burn the village down. And she will demonstrate a tremendous level of arrogance, condescension and cold hatred that was unimaginable before. For the details go to the film and she will be the one who executes, shoots the handsome would-be writer. ""There are a few things you have to do yourself,"" will she conclude. That frozen inhumanity is beyond all limits. The film thus becomes a demonstration of what human beings can become in extreme conditions. If they can be that rude, brutal, cruel in a situation that has nothing to do with a war, you can imagine what they are ready to do to survive in a situation where life and death are a daily stake. The survival instinct is the strongest motivation for any individual, any group or community and even the human species as a whole. Humane attitudes are in no way natural. So, if you push aside the varnish of good behavior, you find out that many people are bullies when necessary in extreme conditions, even if only a few, and even few of them would be bullies in normal conditions.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",Dogville

Like the book Blindness by José Saramago, and the movie based on that book, it is not an easy watch, but a close, intense and realistic look on the shadow side of mankind.On top, the method of stage acting like in a theatre adds some sense of advantgarde and extravaganza to Dogville, and makes this movie, with the theme, an exceptional piece of art.",Dogville
29,meeza,Dogville is unpleasant but then again Pleasantville in art,8,23 December 2004,"Yo, Dog! You might agree or disagree on my insights for the film ""Dogville"". However, one thing is for certain that the ""Dogville"" framework will be unparalleled by other films this year. Not so much for its positive attributes but more related to its architectural design. ""Dogville"" stars Nicole Kidman as Grace, a desperate fugitive who inhabits the small rural town of ""Dogville"" for immunity. Paul Bettany co-stars as Tom Edison, the complaisant Dogville resident who takes in Grace and eventually falls for her. Their performances were superb in their own unruffled approach. Kidman as Grace was the saving grace of ""Dogville"", and Bettany as Edison lit it up. Initially, the residents of Dogville were somehow reluctant in welcoming Grace. They feared she might be a disgrace to their town. They eventually do utilize her for labor, care-taking, companionship, and guidance. Things do get a little ""doggy-poo"" when police inquiries cause the Dogvillers to be more suspicious of Grace, and the Doggies inevitably dog Grace in devious ways. The men rape her (obviously doggy style), the women humiliate her, and the children ruse her. Chloe Sevigny, Lauren Bacall, Ben Gazzara, Stellan Skarsgard, Phillip Baker Hall, and Patricia Clarkson execute doggoned ravaging performances as the community-orientated Dogville residents. Director Lars von Trier constructs the town of ""Dogville"" in a stage design reminiscent of a play instead of the more formulaic film field setting. Von Trier's dissenting messages about small-town America can be controversial but then again it is a frightening reality. Von Trier's ""trier by error"" directorial approach always pushes the envelope, but it should be commended for its valiancy. He is the antithesis of the feel-good director because the thesis of his films deal with: deprivation, desperation, and humiliation. I do warn you that ""Dogville"" runs for 179 minutes, which can take a good chunk of your dog day afternoon. To keep on describing the numerous theories of ""Dogville"" would be an exercise in futility. Nevertheless, ""Dogville"" does take a bite out of hospitable small-town America. **** Good",Dogville
30,Chris_Docker,Dogged by controversy,10,18 February 2004,"I don't think my mum actually ever forgave father. It wasn't so much what he did. More the fact that she devoted 15 years of life to a someone she was not in love with. Altruism can certainly be character building. Yet do most people inwardly want something in return? Self-sacrifice for its own sake can be foreign to our western way of thinking.The wonderful Nicole Kidman is Grace, a very attractive young woman. She's also a beautiful fugitive, escaping from gangsters.Seeking refuge, Grace enters Dogville. It's a sad, 1930's hamlet in the Rocky Mountains. She will do odd jobs for the inhabitants in return for sanctuary. At first they refuse - very arrogantly - they don't need anything. But amateur philosopher and moderniser, Tom, intercedes. Soon, she is gratefully doing something for everyone. But are the townsfolk risking all by sheltering her? They soon become self-righteous, oppressive, and abusive, piously proclaiming that, ""it is for her own good."" And yet Grace harbours a terrible secret . . .The audience of Dogville is taken through increasingly nasty, almost unsolvable moral dilemmas. Forgiveness, justice, tolerance, and conceit. They all culminate in a traumatic and disturbing finale.This highly original movie is not an easy watch - and, be warned, it lasts for three hours. The first thirty minutes can seem tedious and affected. A few later scenes are exceedingly graphic and quite hard to watch. It will surprise you, it may distress you, and it may cause you to ask questions about yourself. It may even make you walk out in the middle (though hopefully you won't!) Dogville unravels those psychological mechanisms which expose people's real natures. And it doesn't necessarily offer answers.Grace, of course, is not only the name of the main character, but also a 'state of grace' that descends on this unsuspecting town. Heavy symbolism in almost everything is strengthened by unusual cinematography. It is shot on a bare sound stage with markings for walls, bushes and the dog. Such avant-garde theatrical style is unnerving at first, but after half an hour or so one just absorbs it. We become unaware of it, the way one does, say, with subtitles. Dogville, indicated almost entirely by chalk lines, soon feels real and solid. Whether it is justified relies on how much you buy into the mythology being ingeniously created and depicted (Though my opinion is that this is one of those rare cases where revolutionary technique has been completely and holistically justified). Minimalism, literary chapters and omnipresent narration (delivered by John Hurt), help us to focus on Dogville-as-parable rather than Dogville-as-thriller.As the plot thickens, we are forced to watch the emotional isolation and degradation of Grace, neighbours turning a blind eye. We are awkwardly conscious of ethical tensions: the self-justification of the townsfolk, Grace's uncomplaining nature, then ultimately (and perhaps uncomfortably) the implications of such dynamics in our own world.The film has a strong (though not explicit) comment on attitudes shaped by New Testament fundamentalism, of 'turning the other cheek,' versus Old Testament 'eye for an eye' philosophy. But the bigger puzzle is how valid these are, how far they can be taken. More overt comments are directed at foreign and domestic policy, and many people from the USA have taken offence at the thinly-veiled allusions to America.Dogville is gut-wrenching in a way that stays with us long after we stop watching. It is a film for serious filmgoers rather than those wanting easily-digestible entertainment. In its own way, Dogville is a monumental achievement, for its innovative techniques, its effectiveness and impact on its audience - not to mention its implications on the world we live in. One of the most mature and arresting works made by Danish Dogme founder Lars von Trier, many see it as a modern masterpiece (if also a readily misunderstood one).On the arguments that raged over it, von Trier said, ""If there is a moral it is that good and evil exists in everybody and circumstances can bring it out."" But to reach the states portrayed by the characters, he nudged them towards trauma so powerfully that they had a 'confessions' box on set and appeared visibly disturbed by what they had gone through.Political comment, satire, religious metaphor, an expose of psychological forces within each of us, a feminist diatribe, or pure cinematic art? Dogville is probably all of these. Or is it just pretentious twaddle? Critics and scholars worldwide have been divided and will continue to be divided on Dogville, but its place in cinema history seems assured, as does its place in the annals of Kidman's greatest works.My parents, by the way, both found their ideal partners in later marriages. My father left first and so mum claimed the moral high ground. But I think our early days of near-poverty were more character forming than any self-sacrifice. Poverty is often an absence of power. When you come out of it you've learnt the effect that other people's power on you has and, hopefully, used that to do better rather than beat up yourself or others with it. Survivors, for good or ill, rarely feel beholden. As Grace says, ""Some things you have to do yourself.""",Dogville

I'm not sure if I got the idea of the film right, but I belive it was supposed to show that at first better looking place may be a much worse play. I think the moral of the story is to stay there you are and be happy with it, don't go elsewhere for a better life cause it may be a much worse place to live in. This film was basicly torture porn, the innocent girl got stuck in the place she thought was a blessing to get in, but once she got in, it slowly revealed it's true nature and she could not escape from it anymore.

34,onepotato2,Our (awful) Town,1,30 December 2009,"Dogville is a mis-conceived project, full of freshmen, self-canceling urges that von Trier should be deeply embarrassed about. Von Trier is serious, see, so he omits the sets, and basically hands you a three hour play. It's like watching PBS. Why does he reject this fundamental aspect of film? Who knows. If he wanted to focus your attention on the ideas, he'd just film it inconspicuously and the unremarkable production would drop away, foregrounding the ideas. Instead the severe non-set becomes a conspicuous way of saying that he's different; that he's a genius with ego needs. He hires an all-star cast (Hmmm, I think I figured out why there's no budget for sets). The morose 'play' is like a dated Clifford Odets piece co-written by Josef Goebbels. He wants to grind your nose in a bleak story that plays out over a pretentious length (He's so serious, see), but you're not thinking of the ideas in the piece, because he hired that distracting all-star cast. If he wants to make a serious point about the hopelessness of human nature, why make it so obscure that only 100 viewers (tops) are going to relate to it? He sabotages the life of his own ideas. Even the end credits are unrelentingly hopeless; in case we missed the puritanical condemnations of the story, we're presented with bleak, historical images of impoverished Americans. You end up watching it thinking 'What was his goal? ...Why did any of these actors get on board?' because the answer is not on the screen. It begs the question; Of all the thing von Trier finds contemptible, isn't being a director who makes obscure, arty-farty films among them?The camera work is noticeably feeble. The narration is bookish, and deadening. The Elm Street markings look like a board game, not the thoughtful layout of a real space. von Triers Dogme charter really produces some sucky movies.Full disclosure: I an enormous fan of von Trier's film Europa (aka Zentropa).

35,rosscinema,Turgid film from a biased director,4,13 June 2005,"American filmmakers have filmed stories dealing with the exploits of Nazis in Germany and of the French in terms of colonialism and other unflattering events in history and while everyone has their own agenda I feel that the director in this case suffers from both paranoia and from living a completely sheltered life. The film is set on a soundstage with very little props and chalk lines on the floor to show where buildings are with sound effects added when characters pretend to knock on doors. The story is about a woman named Grace (Nicole Kidman) who during the depression stumbles into a Rocky Mountain town called Dogville after fleeing some gangsters and immediately meets Tom Edison (Paul Bettany) who helps her with the other residents.*****SPOILER ALERT***** The people of Dogville agree to let her stay for two weeks which turns out well for Grace but things get worse when the male residents start forcing themselves on her. After a failed escape plan Grace is chained with a metal collar and raped repeatedly on a nightly basis until one day the gangsters that she was fleeing show up headed by The Big Man (James Caan) who turns out to be Grace's father!This is the supposed first film in a trilogy by Lars von Trier about capitalist America and one has to wonder if the next two efforts will be as slanted. I personally don't care if a foreign film director is anti-American as long as their open with their ideologies but von Trier publicly beats around the bush and it's obvious he has more resentment towards America than he's letting on. With that, I did find several things to admire and Kidman's performance is not only pretty good but at times it can be described as brave especially with her character's treatment in the rape sequences. The only part of the film that I really questioned was with the character Tom Edison and I'm not sure if audiences understand that this character was as much a scumbag as the others. I know he's portrayed as trying to be helpful and sympathetic but the truth is that he had no intention on helping Grace get out of Dogville and really wanted her to remain there. This film is interesting in terms of it's artistic integrity and I've always favored films with a Brecht-like approach (hear that Hollywood?) but one can't help but sense von Trier's hostility and anger not only with his views of America but with his actors who have all mentioned his bad attitude towards them. I'm not going to say that this is a bad film because it's not but it is one that has a definite slant in it's story and while I greatly admire von Trier's talent as a director his personal conflicts have interfered with this effort.",Dogville

His ambition is too great and notwithstanding the fact that he made a movie that rivets our attention from the first to the last scene, he fails his aim partially by losing himself in scenes and dialogues of confused philosophy and ending the movie in a very pessimistic way revealing he doesn't believe at all in mankind and human beings. He tries to reproduce society in a microcosm represented by a small village whose scenery is shown like in a theatrical play (the house walls, the roads, etc are drawn on the ground and not built). The people who lives there are presented as nice, simple and good in the beginning but end up by revealing themselves as bad, mean and disloyal as the gang of bandits that is after the girl (Nicole Kidman) who escapes his gang boss of father with a very dangerous secret. A few scenes are very touching as the ordeal that the girl begins to be subjected by the villagers from a certain moment on. But the movie's final message turns up to be a bit confusing and short of reaching fully its proposed aim.

It is a bit off putting at first. it took me a good 15 - 25 minutes before I noticed that I had lost my distaste for the production. Once I was over that, this turned out to be a great story. Another oddity is that is has a narration that feels very much like someone is reading you a book. Needless to say the presentation is unique. The cast portrayed their characters really well and this was nicely scripted. I am sure that this probably won't be a film that many people watch due to the way it is presented but if you can handle it, this is awesome and I suggest you give it a chance.",Dogville
40,BrandtSponseller,It's like a dull knife that just ain't cuttin',4,14 April 2005,"Set implicitly around the 1930s in a small town, Dogville, which is represented by a single minimalist stage ""arrangement"", the film begins with a prologue introducing us to Dogville's residents. Shortly after, Tom Edison (Paul Bettany) hears gunfire in the distance and Grace Margaret Mulligan (Nicole Kidman) comes running into town. Tom gives her shelter and hides her from gangsters who drive into town only minutes later. The town is suspicious of strangers, so Tom suggests that Margaret should help everyone out for a couple weeks before they vote on whether she can stay or not. She's successful in her bid. The film concerns her evolving relationships with the town's residents, most of which begin as positive blossomings and eventually turn sour. All the while, it is made periodically clear that the persons searching for Margaret are not giving up--they instead seem to be increasing their intensity. How will everything be resolved? I know this review is likely to further my reputation as something of an incorrigible contrarian, but what can I do? I have to call 'em as I see 'em; I'm not going to praise the films I'm ""supposed"" to praise and damn the ones I'm supposed to damn just to fit in with the right crowd or have the right people think that my opinions are respectable. My sole concern is to try to give every film as fair a shake as I can, and then report my honest views on its merits or lack of the same, whether everyone else likes the film or no one does. And as I saw it, Dogville is a failure.It begins with at least one promising idea--the minimalist ""set"" is an interesting approach and is visually arresting to an extent. It's primarily a large, empty stage, with homes and public buildings represented by outlines of their shapes on the floor. There are words on the floor to identify many objects or structures, from streets to home ownership to the town's dog, Moses, and scattered props and pieces of sets here and there to represent things like the door of the general store, characters' beds and chairs, the church bell tower, and so on. However, Dogville also begins with narration that sounds immediately pretentious, atrocious performances, and a script that could hardly be more banal. Director/writer Lars von Trier writes the narration and dialogue in a style superficially reminiscent of 19th Century American literature; it's not entirely dissimilar to, say, Mark Twain (a fact he references by the character Tom Edison Sr. (Philip Baker Hall) reading Twain's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer), except that it has none of Twain's wit or wisdom. In fact, until its last couple scenes, when it becomes a bit sarcastic, Dogville is almost completely humorless, and that's just one of the many things that make the film not ""ring true"".Most of the performances are remarkably bad. Except for a couple cast members, everyone sounds like they are doing a first read-through of the material, with an emphasis on reading. The primary exception is Kidman, who does an admirable job with this less than stellar material, and a number of smaller parts, played by Baker, Patricia Clarkson (as Vera) and a couple others. Bettany was particularly annoying, although James Caan was good once he finally appeared, despite having to engage in atrocious, overlong dialogue.I also found myself frequently annoyed by the cinematography, which was primarily (if not completely) executed with hand-held cameras. This fact was emphasized by shakiness, awkward pans and far too many fast zooms. It's not that I dislike any hand-held work--far from it. But there didn't seem to be a particular reason for the style of hand-held cinematography that's in the film, and the repetition of affected camera movement became grating.But what about the plot and the subtexts? Well, first let me say something positive. Once things began to turn sour between Grace and the residents of Dogville, I started enjoying the film more, and I actually loved the ending. I was very tempted to give the film an extra point for the outstanding climax, at least until I reminded myself of what a chore it was to get there! The film lasts nearly 3 hours. Two of those hours are incredibly dull. Even once the improvement set in, it took an hour to get to the climax. Maybe if von Trier would have compressed Dogville into a running time of, say, an hour at the most, I could have given it a 6. But just maybe.The first two hours are about uninteresting people doing uninteresting things. We learn about them, but we don't care about them. It's as engaging as two hours of hearing about Joe Average's typical day on the job as an accountant, or at a bottlecap factory, only we have to hear about it with that poor, humorless approximation of the 19th Century literary style, largely from a narrator, and with nearly everyone reciting lines as if they're 11 year olds trying to read Heidegger out loud.As is made all too obvious by the ending credits, von Trier intends the film as somewhat of a scathing ""satire"" of America, seen through the eyes of small town life. Only, that goal doesn't come across unless you force it (and even then it doesn't work very well), because one could hardly call anything about the story realistic, even taking it as a parable and just considering whether it shows anything realistic about ""human nature"" and relationships. It doesn't. On the whole, people don't behave that way, talk that way, and so on. Not that I'm looking for realism; I'm much more a fan of fantasy, surrealism, absurdism, etc. But I'm not exactly looking for fantasy about a blowhard droning on and on about doing chores or someone pining away to buy Hummels from a general store, either.",Dogville
41,Spuzzlightyear,What would YOU do if Nicole Kidman wandered in?,8,8 October 2005,"I saw Dogville the other day, actually rather hurriedly, as I wanted to see it before I saw Manderlay (which is reviewed elsewhere) at the film festival here. I had heard so much about this film, I couldn't really wait to see this, as I am a big Von Trier fan. Dogville stars Nicole Kidman as Grace, a woman-on-the-run from the authorities who seeks shelter in a quiet mountain town (no Cartman though). The residents of the town agree to take her in. provided that she do a little bit of community service. However, as more of her past starts to come to light, the community wants more service, sil vous plait.While this is not the top-tier bracket of what Von Trier has done, I really enjoyed this film. Kidman is dynamite as usual, and well, what can I say, Paul Bettany again proves he's one of the best actors around today. Also in for the ride are Patricia Clarkson, Lauren Bacall, James Caan, and Von Trier-stalwarts Udo Kier and Jean-Marc Barr. Definitely not for everyone, (heavens, I didn't even mention the movie takes place on a soundstage, with chalk drawn walls!)

45,rockman182,Dogville (2003),8,17 August 2017,"I haven't watched a bulk of Lars Von Trier's filmography but I do love the Depression Trilogy. Melancholia is just an absolutely amazing work of art (and the first proof that Kirsten Dunst is really good), and Nymphomaniac is so f'ed up but undoubtedly amazing. I feel like a lot of those films and the mood and melancholy involved is personal to his own depression. In a similar way I think Dogville really purveys his misanthropic feelings towards humans. Nonetheless, I found this film to be really entertaining, unique, and artistic.The film is about a woman who comes upon the inhabitants of a town called Dogville after fleeing from gangsters. The town takes her in on the condition that she do chores for the town folk. Gradually the favors that she does turn intense and a growing hatred occurs for the woman. She is then treated like a slave, chained, raped and emotionally abused. She once escapes danger in her life and then stumbles upon it in Dogville, and becomes emotionally withdrawn to the abuse she suffers. The film explores the evil of human beings and the revenge taken upon those who wronged you.I really enjoyed this film but I can see film goers finding it pretentious and tedious. The film is quite unique as its a parable that is literally a stage production. The actors are on a stage the entire time complete with chalk lines dividing different territories in Dogville. I've never seen anything like this before and really liked the unique production on display. The film is also a near full 3 hours long and is mostly filled with dialogue. If this turns you away, then this film probably isn't for you. Lars von Trier films aren't for everyone , but I'm quite appreciative of the strong pathos on display in his work.Nicole Kidman is DAMN good in this film. Her character (Grace) is an innocent beautiful and obedient woman who gets taken advantage up. Things get to a breaking point and she realizes the ugly nature of humans and then takes revenge. Human beings cause the suffering of other humans and things are a cycle. Whatever is done onto you is done back onto others. Its a bleak tale of human misdoings that will polarize viewers. I'm leaning towards masterpiece though.8/10",Dogville
46,cultfilmfan,Dogville,8,6 August 2006,"Dogville is set in the 1930's and is the predecessor to the film Manderlay (which I actually saw before this film). The film is about a young woman named Grace who is on the run from the mob and she then stumbles upon a small town named Dogville. One of the members of the town named Tom takes a liking to Grace and has a town vote where they decide to let Grace stay. To repay the townspeople for their kindness Grace helps everybody out around town with their chores and tasks that need to be done. Everyone really seems to take a liking to Grace, but that soon changes and Grace then discovers that the people in this town who she thought were so nice really aren't that nice at all and it probably would have been better if she had never have stumbled upon this town in the first place.

Dogville has good direction, a good script, good performances by the cast and good costume design. As I stated above I saw the film's sequel Manderlay before I saw Dogville and I must say that they are similar in many ways, but because I liked Manderlay a lot I do not mean that as a negative comment. Once again this film like Manderlay has very few sets and no walls and the film is very low budget. The film is a little slow moving at times, but it did not stop me from enjoying the film. Once again writer/director Lars Von Trier proves that he is a very good storyteller and does not need a lot of movie, sets or special effects to make a good film with a good story. I liked how in the film I didn't really know where the film was going and the ending surprised me in many ways, but in a good way. I like how the film went in different directions and tried different things and it achieved everything it went out and set to do. As I said in my review of Manderlay this film may not be for everyone as well. It is a slow moving film and it is quite artistic and fairly symbolic and philosophical in some ways and I just thing people may be bored with the film because of it's style and long running time. However I think this film is perfect for fans of artistic films and films that have good stories and that is mainly what the film focuses on instead of big effects and things that would further help sell the film. Instead what we get is an interesting story that is in a lot of ways like reading a novel. A good novel as a matter of fact because it draws you in and you want to see where the film goes. I think after reading this review you should be able to tell if this film is for you or not and if you are not sure if you would like this movie than it might be better not to see it, but for those interested or who want to experiment with this film then I recommend this film and it's sequel Manderlay.",Dogville
47,jluis1984,Brilliant study on humanity and morality,10,13 January 2006,"""Dogville"" is a movie that has created a lot of controversy due to its supposed ""anti-American"" message; nevertheless, the work of director Lars Von Trier transcends nationalities and, intentional or not, its powerful message is a social critic to the very human nature. A very dark tale that explores humanity and morality, in a way a fable would do.The plot is quite simple at its core; Grace is a runaway, and suddenly she enters in the small town of ""Dogville"", a town lost in the Rocky mountains where its inhabitants live peaceful and simple lives. Tom, a resident of ""Dogville"" finds her and offers her help, he convinces her that the people of ""Dogville"" are good and will help her. They come to an agreement with the town where Grace will work for them in exchange of her safety. When the people of Dogville begins to abuse of her needs, nothing will be the same again because she has a secret, a very dangerous secret.As most people know by now, the main characteristic of ""Dogville"" is that it has no scenery, and that the setting is established by simple chalk lines and some props, giving the movie the feeling of a play, and focusing the audience's attention in the characters. While this may sound like a very hard task to do, it actually works superbly because the nature of the story is not in the visuals, but in the actions, and the same way we can see through the walls of ""Dogville"", we can see through the characters, and we witness something we wouldn't like to know about them.The movie is a very interesting study on morality, and it works on many levels; starting with the first scene, is Grace really innocent? should the town help her? Grace is a good woman who seems to do anything to be accepted and as times goes by, she becomes part of the town, but as soon as the troubles begin, everyone seems to have reasons to use Grace at will, turning her into an object. Why does Grace accept this suffering? Is this really better than her past? What is fair? Who makes the laws? The movie raises this kind of questions. It is a movie that actually makes you think and reflect on the very nature of mankind. It is a very well developed story.A movie like this is very challenging for actors, but the cast is up to the task. Nicole Kidman as Grace carries the film with power and her performance is truly believable. Paul Bettany is Tom, and he is really one of the surprises of the film, his performance is quite amazing and is hard to believe he is British. He manages to do a good accent in the movie. The rest of the cast is equally impressive, with Lauren Bacall, Stellan Skarsgård and Patricia Clarkson in superb roles as residents of ""Dogville"".Sadly, I cannot judge about the editing and pacing. I have read that the movie is quite long and drags at times. I have seen the international 155 minutes version, and that cut really has an amazing pace and makes the movie flow easily and still delivered a powerful message.In the end, is not about Dogville being America, is about Dogville as representation of mankind, mankind at its darkest nature. It is a haunting reflection of ourselves, and the message is delivered perfectly. 10/10. Masterpiece.",Dogville
48,K3nzit,Lars Von Trier's masterpiece,10,2 January 2020,"There are quite many people who think this movie is weird. I can't understand why someone would say such a thing. Maybe it's because they have never been in theater or they've only seen Hollywood blockbusters. I love Dogville, it's different and very well-made. Visually the most minimalist movie I've ever seen. That puts little more weight on actors shoulders, because they get full attention of the viewer. But the impressive cast of Dogville pulls it off well, with the help of a marvelous screenplay. The story is Dogville's biggest strength. It's about the human nature and how horrible we can be to one another.",Dogville
49,EijnarAmadeus,"DOGVILLE, it certainly doesn't get any more peculiar, for a start-",7,16 April 2005,"Nicole Kidman in a Lars Von Trier drama set on a theater stage, this certainly seems interesting. And the movie is; very interesting and fascinating, though very peculiar and odd.Nicole Kidman is Grace, a woman bewildered up in a Colorado mountain town named Dogville. Containing very few citizens, the locals is very skeptical to Grace except Tom Edison, a sort of spokesman to the town. Nobody knowing about her past, it's certain that Grace is on the run from something or someone.. To get to stay there as a hide, she agrees to do work for them.DOGVILLE is exceptionally original. Set in a dark stage, where the houses are simply marks on the ground with titles on the floor, as; bathroom, kitchen and even dog! Seeing such a star as Kidman in such a low budget movie is also odd, and makes the whole setting very fascinating. And the whole idea is extremely well; being a viewer you can simply see through all of the walls through off course the town visitors are acting like there were actual houses there, so you get the feeling and you do, see everything that's happening behind closed doors.Paul Bettany, the growing star, also does a very fine performance and altogether with the town citizens, they make brilliant cast that all convinces and all have such deep water. DOGVILLE stands clearly out, not being as any other movie you have probably seen for a while.

The townsfolk agree to take her in and little by little start to take advantage of her until they become abusive, even the children.",Dogville
51,RJBurke1942,"In any country, all towns are Dogville, given the chance",9,18 March 2007,"This is an old story that's been done before, under different guises: a woman on the run, seeks shelter and anonymity in a small town, far away from those hunting for her. Initially, the people of the town are dubious, but at least one person persuades them to allow the woman to stay. At first, things go well. Over time, however, jealousies and animosities surface such that the town's people turn against the fugitive to the extent that they abuse her and eventually give her up to her oppressors.Such a story could have easily centred upon a man on the run, or a small child, or even a couple. Hence, from that perspective, the story is simple. But, that's where the similarities to others end...This narrative is, in one sense, experimental cinema: the entire setting is contained within a large sound stage (somewhere in Sweden); the cinematic and narrative props (houses, streets, interiors, doors, windows, just about everything except cars and trucks) are rudimentary or non-existent. For example, all the 'doors' into the houses are make-believe  when a character enters a house, s/he makes the motion of opening and closing a door but there is no door, only the sound of the door opening and closing. All the action within the narrative is contained within that large set. All the actors are visible all the time, even in situations where two actors are supposed to be in private  a nod, perhaps, to the illusion of privacy that is so dear to all. The entire story is accompanied with a voice over (from John Hurt) in nine chapters. So, not only is this film very much like a stage production, it's also a very staged production...So, it won't appeal to a lot of people, I think. But, I was riveted to my seat for nearly the entire three hour run time.Primarily, this is a philosophical treatise examining a moral choice we all face from time to time: to what extent should we, or must we, assume the role of Good Samaritan when a situation arises? Not content with analyzing and answering that issue, the writer/director (Lars von Trier) then continues to explore what happens when the situation is compromised to the extent that the fugitive becomes a threat to the town's assumed safety. What then? There are still moral choices and this director shows what can happen when some, or all of the people compromise their principles in the face of perceived or imagined danger. In doing so, the director touches on the will to power and how power corrupts all; and then toys with Nietzsche's ideas about beyond good and evil in the closing scenes which must be seen to be appreciated for the irony and fury portrayed. Those scenes will stay with you for a long, long time. I saw it coming and I wasn't disappointed.This is a director's film. The actors  an international cast, all of whom are excellent in their roles  are incidental to the crucial issues von Trier is expounding upon. There is not much of a musical soundtrack; the dialog is sparse, but incisive; the camera work favors many medium and close-up shots, showing emotion is great detail; and the muted colors and dark shading add to the overall melancholia and depression. In the final scenes, however, red predominates  horrifically and viscerally.Anybody who is seriously interested in cinema should  must  see this film. I cannot forget it. Highly recommended.",Dogville
52,JohnRayPeterson,Another Lars von Trier movie I don't like,4,3 March 2012,"Another Lars von Trier movie I don't like, for very similar reason as a recent review I wrote about Manderlay. This movie has an even more impressive cast than Manderlay and the story is less of an attempt at educating the audience to history, etc etc.. It is a pure drama that could have provided me and the general wider audience with an entertaining movie. It is another one of those stage play movies. If I want to see a stage play, I'll bloody pay for it and go see it. I did not stay in my chair in front of the screen to find out the end which I understand was brilliant. With that kind of a cast and story, I would pay to see the ensemble in a real theater.Don't get me wrong, not all stage play movies can work and work well but they have to fit the screen in a way where you believe you're seeing a movie about a great story and with good actors. Two such movies I reviewed this past year are in fact this sort of thing. But they were, essentially two actors, talented ones, in a single room and alike, delivering their lines. I was not frustrated by the stage sets. In Dogville, as in Manderlay, I was distracted by the stage sets and how actors moved about in such settings; I simply could not appreciate the fine work that appeared to be going on. The two stage plays on movie I did liked were: 'The Sunset Limited' and 'Interview'.",Dogville

The theatrical minimalist approach made the story even more compelling by attracting the spectator towards the story and not towards the setting or the cinematography.It is one of the best performances by Nicole Kidman, which I consider a merit mostly of the director, who forces her out of her comfort zone as an actress to portray a vulnerable not so innocent woman. All the actors are great in their roles, although is the script what mesmerizes the spectator.Von Trier took many risks here, those that will not satisfy lazy watchers or people who just want to watch a movie without any depth.",Dogville
54,WriterDave,An Essay on Arrogance,9,3 September 2004,"I had my reservations about ""Dogville."" I felt the audacious Von Trier had taken a step back with ""Dancer in the Dark""--essentially a pretentious overwrought musical retread of his masterpiece ""Breaking the Waves."" And when I heard about the familiar plot (heroine endures increasingly grim hardships and becomes a martyr) and the chalk outlined sets and ""minimalist"" aesthetic he would be applying to ""Dogville,"" I feared he might never again reach the earlier heights of his past films. He was retreading the same themes in new pretentious ways.But fear not, Von Trier delivered the goods in ways I had never suspected and for the first time in many moons showed some signs of growth thematically as a director (alas, the heroine does not become a martyr but instead gets her revenge). ""Dogville"" was unfairly dismissed by many as a filmed ""play"" because of the staged quality of its sets and cinematography. But for me, with its superb voice-overs that made the narrator seem as if he was reading excerpts from some lost classic of literature and its quaint chapter stops (this is a film told in nine chapters with a prologue as the sparse opening credit tells us) ""Dogville"" became a literary endeavor. And once you adapted to the strange visual style and the literary devices, you soon realized that Von Trier was here to provide us an ""illustration"" of a theme. Why are people afraid of accepting gifts? Why are people reluctant of outsiders? Why are people so arrogant in thinking that they can make the world a better place by some small or large deed, by some intervention or favor? These illustrations are brilliantly depicted in the anguish on the actors' faces as they play characters ravaged by arrogance and set on a path to impending doom because of their inability to see the error of their foolish, yet originally well intentioned, ways. Though it takes place in a small mountain town in Depression era America and the main character is a runaway mob moll (played devastatingly by Nicole Kidman) the illustration is both very timely and timeless. Is this film made by a notoriously arrogant European anti-American? You betcha! Will students of cinema debate its merits for decades to come? You bet your sweet bippy! Will I ever doubt Von Trier again? NEVER",Dogville
55,Antagonisten,A very recommended viewing,9,27 March 2005,"I'm no big fan of Lars Von Trier, i can admit that right away. That is also why it took me so long to decide i wanted to see this movie. The style used in the movie didn't seem appealing to me either so i remained skeptical. But at last i decided to give this a try. And i was, to put it frank, blown away.Dogville is the tale of the young Grace (Nicole Kidman) who arrives mysteriously at a small mountain town called Dogville. She seems to be hunted by someone and she is taken in by the friendly Tom (Paul Bettany). However, for her to stay in the little town she needs to consult also with the other towns-folk. They take two weeks to decide whether she can stay in town.Dogville is a rather bleak look at the aspects of humanity. It presents a rather grim view of human nature and what ordinary people might do when given power to use their fellow man. As Grace becomes more desperate to stay, and the people of the small town realize this the friendly folk suddenly change. It doesn't surprise me that director Lars Von Trier is the one to present the kind of view on humanity that is shown in this movie, as he has always seemed rather cynical to me. However i can't really say that i feel he's wrong.What is the most obvious thing about this movie is the method in which it is made. There is no scenery and hardly anything except the actors and the clothes they are wearing.. The small mountain town is drawn up in chalk in a studio, some furniture are put in the drawn rooms and people move inside and outside the lines in the ground. In this way it becomes more like watching a minimalist theater play than a movie. While this may sound awkward i found it to work very well. Which brings me to the second thing that was obvious right from the start.The acting. Amazing. Nicole Kidman does what i would term one of the best performances of her career. But she's not alone, all the other actors are also rock-solid. Paul Bettany is also worth a mention in my opinion, i have never seen him this good. And this amazing acting is also a huge contributing factor as to why the whole theater-setup with no scenery works so well. With less good actors this could have been catastrophic.I was, like i said in the beginning of this review, quite skeptical to watching this movie. But now that i have i'm happy i did. This absolutely stands as the best movie i have seen in quite a long time. It says something about peoples capacity for cruelty that really made me think. This one i feel will stay with me for a long time. A very recommended viewing and a triumph for Lars Von Trier. I rate it 9/10.",Dogville

I think one of Paul Bettany's greatest assets as an actor is his voice/British accent. Giving him an American drawl took that away.It would be nice if Von Trier could move on and be a little more diverse in his film making. Like ""Breaking the Waves"", ""Dogville"" shows you what happens when a tight, closed community turns on you. I appreciated ""Dancer in the Dark"", even though it's one of the most depressing films ever made. This film was a piece of pretentious crap that broke no new ground. The ""Young Americans"" ending brought home the distinct anti-American slant, but that was just the cherry on the whipped cream...I pretty much hated this film.As I said in my Title line, someone either needs to medicate Von Triers, or better yet, please stop funding his films.",Dogville
59,eagandersongil,A study of the human being,9,5 November 2016,"""Dogville"" is a cinematic experience, or should I say a social experience? Good, do not know. The fact is that Lars Von Trier tells a story about human nature in a city that is no more risk on the ground in a film that is 3 hours long, impossible? fulsome? silly? no, nothing like that, quite the contrary, the genius of ""Dogville"" is in its simplicity, everything is simple, but everything is extremely technical quality, let's talk about the best thing in the film, the script, which goes in the 30s and tells the story of Grace (Nicole Kidman) who is running away from gansgters and decides to take shelter in Dogville, a town with 15 inhabitants who decides to hide in exchange for favores.E is there that Lars Von Trier makes a study on human evil, showing the extent to which human being is able to act when it has power over the other, and how it takes situations of advantages when you can, benefits those who go this the rapes to simple favors, going to leave Grace chained as a dog, but Lars von Trier also tells us in the final scene that is intrinsic to the human being and to the fact that Grace did not kill the dog is a message for us, because the dog is not evil by nature as human beings. Technically, the file has a otina photograph, although the city does not really exist, all climate change are flagged with perfect care, she spends host and fear at the same time, the picture is good, sound mixing is amazing, because we have doors, windows, or anything, but we have the sounds, and it does that as long you just forget that this city simply does not exist, and the performances are very good, Nicole Kidman is great. I love Dogville, pos despite its three hours he has pace, and has something to say, and is a very intelligent comment, I love the fact that the city does not exist, it goes on the idea that can be any city, I love the story third-person and especially love the theatrical atmosphere of the film, ""Dogville"" is more than a movie, it's a lesson on the human being.",Dogville
60,OttoVonB,A cinematic implausibility!,10,14 January 2004,"If ever such a thing existed, Dogville would be it. A mix of Dogma 95 film-making and filmed stage play on the technical side, Dogville should not work as it does. Dogma 95 is a pretentious minimalist movement supposed to extract cinematic purity from its subject. Filmed plays with no sets are a bore. Yet Lars Von Trier's technique has never been more appropriate.Dogville happens in a desperately poor and quiet township  of feeble, simple, ordinary folk, among which philosopher Tom (Bettany), who wishes to elevate them beyond what they are. His ideal test would be a stranger to test their acceptance. His prayers are answered in the form of fugitive Grace. At first the darling infant like Grace (Kidman) is kindly accepted but as her hunters are more and more relentless in their efforts to seek her out, the town starts to demand more and more of her to ""compensate"" and, well, things get out of hand to put it lightly. This hardly sums up all the more subtle aspects (in fact this same synopsis is on the DVD's cover): Dogville - the very name being a metaphor for the film's great theme, how humans can range from God to Dog in such a small amount of time - has many things to say about small communities where no formal rules are established and reprises in a very efficient way all the themes of a story it resembles: Lord of the Flies. Dogville has no police, thus to draw the parallel with Lord of the Flies, no ""adult supervision"".The themes are universal and are treated in a very adult manner on many levels. The actors give stellar performances and Kidman is more a vehicle for the story than a true hero, though she serves it well. Kudos go to the many excellent supporting players: Bettany is fantastically nuanced and more than holds his own against the film's star, often overshadowing her. Otherwise, Skarsgard, Ivanek and Caan give memorable turns in a film littered with perfectly balanced and credible performances. The technical aspect serves the whole psychological aspect for, since their are no walls in Dogville, we see the houses in our mind, according to the level of moral corruption of the moment. First described by our narrator as miserable huts, during Grace's days of joy they become beautiful and warm. During the later moments of betrayal and suffering they become ugly and oppressive. Von Trier successfully invites us to fill the blanks in ourselves. This film also has its moments of visual beauty, unlike most of Von Trier's work: the elegant aerial mobile shots of the town make the town folk look like ants or pawns, digital fireflies floating through the air on the 4rth of July add a surprising touching poetry, A steady frame shot of Grace, lying among apples in the back of a truck, weeping... So many odd moments that come out as breathtaking because they form such a special mix of the unusual, appropriate and poetic.Again some will be put off at first and this is only natural. To some degree the whole experiment come can off as arrogant and overly pseudo-intellectual and those are flaws Von Trier definitely possesses as a director and as a person, yet intelligence and a bizarre kind of cinematic gift are qualities he certainly has as well. If one is to get anything out of Dogville, and their is a huge wealth to walk away with, one must be prepared to invest oneself. The first half hour might seem trying for newcomers, but once you've started playing along, the film engulfs you with a strength you would have never suspected...A cinematic implausibility. A testament to the moving image's power to awe and inspire.",Dogville
61,flingebunt,Pretentious and overrated,6,18 February 2005,"There is a rule I want people to remember, Art-house movies are art-house movies because they don't appeal to everyone. A movie that one person loves might be hated by someone else.Dogville is a movie that will appeal to a small group of people, but generally speaking it was a disappointed, overlong and too simple a movie to really be considered worth it.The great analysis of the American dream, a woman stumbles into a small town fleeing gangsters. She is taken in reluctantly and while the town initially warms to her they later exploit and reject her.It could have been interesting especially with the high standard of acting this movie contains, but for me it was a dreadful failure.The first problem was the use of stage type scenery in film. I have never scene a film that does this that works. I love the theater and I love to see this type of scenery and lighting in the cinema, but on screen it looks dull and cheap.But because the director never really believed in this technique he decided to spice up the shots by using the classic NYPD Blue jerky camera to give it a documentary look. Separate both techniques are bad, combined it is terrible.Most importantly it can either overwhelm or under support the great acting in this movie.These are only minor points. The characters are overly simplistic and most reflect a single shifting view point, rather than reflecting a diversity of responses. It is like the script writer only had one weak idea and decided to put it into several characters to try and convince people it was a strong idea.The story is too long and takes too long to get anywhere to make the half a point that is contained in this film.An interesting effort, worth checking out, and loved by some, but probably should be avoided by anyone with half a brain.",Dogville
62,mgd_m,Just like reading a good book,7,5 March 2019,"A few thoughts:1) I had a strange, good feeling watching Dogville: it's really like reading a book. Not cinema, not theatre: a book. It's the first time that happened to me. Infact, I was quite surprised afterwards in discovering that it's not based on a book.2) Dogville is too long, but I enjoyed almost every minute of it. Lots of scenes are not strictly necessary, but they serve well the story arc and carefully lead the audience through the changing situation. Also, many dialogues about the moral aspects of the plot (which lenghten the movie) are absolutely essential.3) I hate theatre. So, the choice of theatrical scenography and structure could have ruined it all for me. Instead, after 20 minutes I was good with that, because Von Trier does an outstanding job in making you feel involved, just like it happens with a regular movie. A great part of this involvement comes from a fantastic camera work: lots of times you will notice how perfect and how cinematographic the shots are. You could really imagine what the scenography is missing. This helps the feeling I wrote about, that it's like reading a book.4) I don't know exactly why he chose this kind of scenography, but personally I think it allows the viewer to distance a little bit from the story; so, you know you are watching some kind of allegory, a not-so-real story in which the philosophical themes are much more important than the actual events. In this way, you're able to enjoy many over-the-top dialogues and moments.5) The moral subtext is fantastic. Human beings, misery, evil, mercy, holiness. Dog, dogs, Dogville. The ending could have gone in many different directions, I don't mind, the good thing is giving a story such depth and tackling human behaviour.6) Also about the ending, it's the only moment in which I would have preferred an approach a bit more cinematographic. The movie remains consistent and it doesn't suddenly change the way it's shot, but maybe it's a moment (plot-wise) that could have been a bit more dramatic. Could have. I understand that Von Trier chose to keep a low profile, so that the whole weight of the act bears on the words spoken inside the car.7) Overall, Dogville is a very good, enjoyable piece of deeply thought cinema, where artistic license has a reason. Not an artsy movie just for the sake of being artsy.PS: I'd like to add, I don't understand why it was met with such mixed reactions. Critics usually rave about super-artsy things, often when such things are pretentious boring garbage (""The killing of a sacred deer""), so I don't get why Dogville received a different treatment, when it's obviously much more than that.",Dogville
63,jpintar,Boreville is more like it,3,1 September 2004,"Dogville is a very strange movie.  It is set like a theater production than a movie.  There are no sets to speak of where people pretend to open and close doors (this gets annoying after a while).  Nicole Kidman plays a woman who is hiding in a small town from mobsters.  There she is put to work for little pay by the town like an outsider (read: immigrant).  The biggest problem with this movie is that it is incredibly boring.  Whatever  point the director is making about America, he makes it early and often.  We know from our history books how Americans treat outsiders so we don't need to spend nearly three hours watching this movie to know that.  The fact that the director doesn't live or work in America shows great ignorance on his part.  There is prejudice all over the world, America should be the last place he targets.  Kidman and Paul Bettany try hard but the rest of the cast, particularly Lauren Bacall, play such unlikable characters that we don't care about them.  3/10",Dogville
64,noahgibbobaker,Mostly awesome.,7,16 March 2021,"I wish the story was more interesting cause the style is something I would love to see executed brilliantly, unfortunately this feels a little style-over-substancey. Don't get me wrong, I love the style, I love the idea it's completely unique to this film (and manderlay, the sequel to this) which is something I appreciate so much, but everything from the set-up to the climax feels less than defined, narrative wise.Most of the side characters are actually quite interesting, none of them are defined further than a simple trait or two, but they're interesting traits. One of them is blind and doesn't want the village to find out and one of them is embarrassed about using the brothel every month and doesn't want anyone to find out, these are just two of the 14 side characters who have a similar level of development each. Unfortunately only a few of these characters serve an interesting purpose and the rest sort of just there, working with such a huge cast this is expected but everything is so dragged out that I feel like the characters who don't serve a purpose should be given something substantial to do.Some of my favourite production design ever is exhibited, it's such a cool way to tell this story that is on the surface kind of uninteresting, even with the unique sets and incredible attention to detail the story was quite unengaging for the majority of the runtime. I really liked the score and main leitmotif, It always improved the scene when it was used, which is how a score should be used, not to manipulate the audience to get a response that they wouldn't experience otherwise. In classic Von Trier fashion the narration over explains everything which irritates me, this is a huge reason I found the story unengaging, I didn't even need to follow the events as they were explained to me on the chapter card and through the narration.None of the ideas explored are subtle, this is clear an immagration story with really on-the-nose anti-USA themes. Grace enters dogville where the citizens aren't certain about her presence until they are able to exploit her for manual labour and for their sexual gratification. There's more to themes of immigrants and immagration than just this but that would go into spoilers and I don't want to spoil this. Even more interesting is the nature v nurture idea explored nearing the end of the film, I am really interested in the nature versus nurture conversation and if you know me you know that I love hearing other perspectives on topics that I'm interested in so seeing a Trierian approach to the argument was awesome.""Dogville"" was great until I had to care about something other than the technical side of the film. Definitely worth a watch, you won't get the same visual experience with anything else.",Dogville
65,mardalsfossen01,Slow start but only gets better. An analysis of mankind and society,9,24 May 2019,"When you tune into 'Dogville', first thing you will notice: the setting. It looks very simplified and like on a theater stage with only some props and outlines on the ground for walls. Made me believe somebody wanted to save some money but it actually makes you focus more on the characters and story and is a welcomed change amongst all the movies which don't use this technique.
Nicole Kidman was the perfect cast and Paul Bettany suits very well to her.
The plot has lots of elements of Drama, small bits of Mystery, Crime.
Somewhat poetically written, focus on acting, plot and the psyche of human beings.",Dogville
66,Gresh854,Perfect Exploration of Human Society,10,6 February 2019,"Dogville is the circadian folktale story about a stranger being accepted and aided by the benevolence of a community except...with a twist: It's actually realistic. And by the predicaments of realism, it's only fair to make the assumption that there will be a backbone of darkness to the tale's across-the-board effects. Lars von Trier's chronicle of social assimilation and the approach to human limit is one that amplifies and enhances itself from elementary primitiveness to unanticipated immaculateness.Nicole Kidman portrays a mystifyingly optimistic, proper-mannered woman who after having everything stripped away from her, seeks out present-day redemption through a pocket-sized town called, Dogville-which might I mention, is scouted inventively through a one-of-a-kind, blueprint-esque aesthetic. There she explores the sanguine beauty of an American terrain that only soon, reveals and manifests it's true colors through abhorrently naturalistic human tendencies.But where the dirty subjection of pragmatism lies, another theme flourishes. Dogville's finale strikes its audience in the bowels with a excruciatingly awakening twist that sheds aggressive amounts of light relating to the sewage-pail of a world we live in. Trier has fabricated a 3-hour masterpiece that exploits the blackened shades of humanity that truly can't be explained any better then in this exhaustively, precise layout of the common anthropoid civilization.

67,Chaves7777,A town where the human being leaves his simplicity,10,20 December 2006,"I cant forget ""Dogville"". I cant forget the beautiful face of Nicole Kidman with the apples. I cant forget the arrogance of the film, the classic Lars Von Trier in a polemic movie. I cant forget that lonely night in my room at 2:00 am when i see ""Dogville"" for first time. Undoubtedly that will never forget itThe story talks about Grace. A woman that needs hide of her dad, a man from the mafia. She founds Dogville, a "" quiet little town no far from here"" and meet a man who help her. But the town don't think like him, so Grace decides win the love of the town doing favors and working for them. But the town began to take advantage of her in horrible ways. But... well, Grace...""Dogvile"" is an excellent catching film, the plot never let you go . I read a movie's magazine from Colombia called ""Kinetoscopio"" and there, i read little interesting thing about this movie. The movie was very rejected by many critics here in Colombia (and i think in the world too). After all, the critic matters? The critics matters? This critic matters?. You can read it, of course, but like the writer of the article in that magazine says, the objective of critic is not so it well understood. So, many movies can be rejected for many of famous critics, for example one critic says that ""Salò or the 120 days of Sodom"" of Pier Paolo Pasolini was a bad movie. But, just because a critic say the movie that i see is bad i too had to say is bad? You know that don't. But, many of us let us take by critics that say ""The Lemon Sisters"" stinks when i think that rules. But... be carefully, after all, the critic has a good function to prevent. Are films that i hate like ""Cannibal Holocaust"". You can read good reviews about this title and then see it... surprise! a disgusting surprise. For that reason we should not trust in the act of any critic that we see. When you see movie you take risks. I think that ""Cannibal Holocaust"" will be great... well, i was so wrong... that is the most disgusting and inhuman film of all. Only for sick people. And why happen to me? Because i read critics that say that is good and i don't read the other critics that say that title was bad. And now... how can you trust me than ""Dogville"" is a must see film. Well... for the message.The message of ""Dogville"" is about us. The human being. We are simple. We can live good and simple. But the ambition and hate can make that us make mistakes. I think that ""Dogville"" is a portrait of the daily life. We see people that they take advantage of us, or we take advantage of them. So, is ""Dogville"" the us that many times are and we don't accept. See this movie... then you find the answer... and believe me... you never going to forget it. *Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any",Dogville

69,blakiepeterson,A Difficult But Rewarding Experience,6,25 May 2015,"Called anti-American by some critics and tiresome in its simplicity by others, ""Dogville"" is not anti-American nor is it tiresome: it is, instead, a deceivingly bare-bones, bizarro masterstroke of a satirical small town America. Not echoing the satanic elements of ""Twin Peaks"" or the ugliness-under-the-beauty breadth of ""In the Heat of the Night""'s Sparta, ""Dogville"" would rather take on the old trait that the human race is inherently cruel and violent, despite an initially hospitable facsimile.Von Trier, the most controversial director of the 2000s (sorry Tom Six), doesn't make such a bold claim with outright magnification; he takes nearly three hours to build upon the suggestion, mounting and mounting until the thought becomes dreadfully exaggerated. And, in a polarizing method of story amplification, sets are not sets but chalky squares on a sound stage, given identity through minimalist props and map-like text designating the area (the main road is stamped ""Elm St.). For most, ""Dogville""'s austere texture will be off-putting. Its complete lack of a structural ""setting"" and its epic running-time are attributes easier to leave than to take.I, perhaps in the minority, don't just appreciate von Trier's daring filmmaking approach here; I applaud it. It works. It's thrilling. ""Dogville"" dawdles at times, and it is especially difficult to avoid clock-watching after the second hour, but impressive is the way that von Trier manages to pull off a film so stylistically eyebrow raising. We are only distracted by its design for the first few minutes; the screenplay, so strong in its ideas and dialogue, gives the environment a three-dimensional shape. Thought-provoking and thoroughly one-of-a-kind, this is a film you won't be forgetting any time soon.Set during The Great Depression, ""Dogville"" follows Grace (Nicole Kidman), a woman on the run from gangsters. Fleeing the law, she stumbles upon Dogville, a miniature Rocky Mountain town with a population so small it is nearly familial. Tight-knit and untrusting of outsiders, the citizens are unsure of whether to accept Grace into their community. It is eventually decided, through Tom (Paul Bettany), the self-appointed spokesman of the public, that Grace can stay as long as she makes herself useful, acting as a maid for anyone who asks. People are reluctant, but before long, she becomes a welcome addition to the normally close-minded Dogville.While most films would end happily, with Grace starting a new chapter in her life, ""Dogville"" continues on and descends into more malevolent territory. As one too many secrets come to light and more and more citizens begin to harbor hateful feelings toward Grace, it doesn't take long for the once pleasant town to transform into a poisonous brewing of malice. It took me three days to finish ""Dogville"", pacing myself at an hour every night -- not a response of boredom, but a response hoping to savor. With nine chapters and a prologue, the film is decidedly a magnum opus of ideas, most of them penetrative if you take the time to really think about what you're watching. By spacing viewing out as far as possible, I was then able to digest the film -- helpful considering its size -- and in return, I found myself riveted. Not riveted in the same way I was when watching Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton play verbal cat-and- house in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"": riveted by the performances, von Trier's unfolding of his conceptual idiosyncrasies.""Dogville""'s plunge into perniciousness does not come swiftly; it climbs slowly, arriving almost inevitably. ""Evil can arise anywhere,"" von Trier stated about the film upon release. ""As long as the situation is right."" With a relationship built on enigma and dead end, the town's disdain for Grace comes as no surprise, but the way they make it known is terrifying, affecting us enormously. Humans may be inherently cruel and violent, but von Trier's delivery of the sentiment is hardly contrived. If most were to philander around a hellhole like Dogville long enough, how long would it be before they spoke their minds instead of hiding their feelings for the sake of manners? How long would it be before confrontations became a norm? The shocking conclusion places morality itself in question. Heaven may be a place on earth if you find the right person, but if your life is sinful, crime-riddled, lonesome, does politeness, unfiltered kindness, matter?A film like ""Dogville"" requires performers unafraid of ambitious material, and the cast, large and monumental, transcends limitations. Kidman is fearless, by turns sympathetic and maddening, and her co-stars, particularly Bacall, Clarkson, and Bettany, startle us in their ability to convincingly walk around wearing two faces and really mean it when they rip off their inviting one.""Dogville"" is an extremely difficult film. It requires a viewer that regards patience as a virtue. But with its cerebral ideas and deceptively condensed setting, it offers filmmaking thrilling in its unwillingness to conform. Von Trier doesn't fear his audience and he doesn't fear his innermost beliefs. Call him controversial, call him xenophobic; he goes where other directors wouldn't dare.",Dogville
70,ozjeppe,Hypnotic and absorbing- if you're a theatre fan!,7,23 June 2006,"Von Trier proves again what a true auteur filmmaker he is. Few could pull this off... yet make it completely hypnotic and absorbing as the theatrical experimental exercise this movie primarily is. And it might take a theatre fan to enjoy it fully. Fantastic script on the double sides of human nature, with a colourful cast (Bettany shines!), effective narration and a climax of biblical proportions. However- I just can't help thinking what a truly great movie this could be, if it was made as a full outdoor production. I don't think it would take the edge off the story itself at all.

71,honorhorror,Are you shivering after seeing Dogville? I am.,9,30 November 2009,"This is probably the most shocking movie experience I've ever had, not only because of the emotional impact, but because this is truly a moral-horror movie that slapped me in the face.The film is probably one of the best moral tales ever told, in which Nicole Kidman and all the supporting cast shined. Why did the makers try to make it look incomplete? Why haven't they used more sophisticated production set rather than some made-believe structures directly exposing the film studio's interior environment to you? I didn't get it at first, thinking this might just be another pretending piece of crap that tried to be ""artistic"".However as the story proceeded, the whole thing started to make senses. Featuring some of the best character study I've ever seen, the story involved you into the adventure of Grace, the main protagonist who's supposed to be despised by us logically and naturally. Then, the audiences were forced into a game that the filmmakers keep you guessing what would happen the next, until the very end.The ending, in my opinion, is the most shocking and frightening ending ever seen in a film. Dogville is by no means marketed as a horror movie, but if one believes himself/herself to have the moral high ground, he or she should stand the test the movie has given us. For me, I chose to live with all the miseries happened to Grace and play along just like every other character in the story, ""sh!t happens"" as they say. This, has not only put me in shame but also freaked me out at the end. Considering the potential spoilers I would caused, I'd suggest you go see it for yourself.With superb acting, very well plotted story and a shocking message for senseless societies, Dogville is easily a masterpiece.",Dogville

The story is full of brutal, saddening, and heartwarming moments. The story is told in chapters, much like a book, with little scenery. The film elegantly puts forward some very deep questions about innocence, ignorance, and morality. The ending is brutal and left me stunned.The acting is amazing. Nicole Kidman performs flawlessly. She plays an innocence girl on the run who wants to begin a new life. Paul Bettany also performs very well. John Hurt narrates the story. His voice perfectly blends into the film as he describes the characters, their thoughts, and the story.The pacing is slow but I enjoyed how Trier takes his time in setting up the characters, the environment, and the story. The runtime can be overlong for nonmovie fans, but once you get into the film it goes by like the wind.Pros: An amazing experimental film, a powerful story, great characters, amazing acting, great questions asked by Trier, and slow pacing that develops the story and charactersCons: The pacing can seem slow to nonmovie goers and the runtime is a little long at almost three hoursOverall Rating: 9.2P.S.

74,Ronin47,Longest review I've ever written - must mean the movie did something right (***),7,8 June 2004,"I still have no idea how I really feel about this film. There are lots of parts that I definitely liked and lots of parts that I definitely didn't like. There were times when I was completely riveted to my seat and other times when I was bored and my mind wandered. Leaving the theater, I was in kind of a daze, with all kinds of conflicting emotions filling my head. Usually that means you've just seen a great movie, but this time I wasn't so sure. Maybe, maybe not. One thing's for sure, it's unlike any other movie ever made. I've only seen one other film from Danish director Lars Von Trier, ""Dancer In The Dark"", and it was incredible (I need to see ""Breaking The Waves"" really bad). He is definitely some some of bizarro genius who is not afraid to p*** people off, and ""Dogville"" is probably his strangest and most intentionally alienating film yet. It's about a desperate woman named Grace (Nicole Kidman) who, in fleeing the mob, arrives at a tiny town (only about 20 residents) in the mountains named Dogville. Arriving late at night, she meets Tom (Paul Bettany), who offers to let her stay and hide out there, if the other residents agree.They do, but reluctantly. Grace wins their respect for a short time by doing odd jobs for all the residents in exchange for their hiding her. Gradually, though, when the townsfolk begin to realize how desperate a situation Grace is in, and how much she depends on them not informing the mob where she is, they begin to take advantage of her. They increase her work, cut her pay, and she is raped several times by men in town. After she tries to escape, she is chained to a wheel and abused even more. Even Tom, who smugly fancies himself the town golden boy, is revealed to be completely spineless and of no help to her. This is already not sounding like a crowdpleaser, but strangest of all is the way the film is presented. It's set entirely on a large wooden stage and there are almost no props of any kind, not even walls. The ""houses"" are actually just chalk outlines on the floor and when characters enter buildings, they mime the act of opening and closing a ""door"", complete with sound effect. To depict things like dimension, time of day, and weather, interesting things are done with the lighting and scant props. Surprisingly, this surreal set-up is amazingly easy to get into after the disorienting first few minutes (when the ""door"" mime stuff is guaranteed to get some deserved chuckles from the audience). I never FORGOT that I was looking at a wooden stage with invisible houses, but I got used to it quickly and was frequently fascinated by it. Lots of people are saying that the film is anti-American, and I have to agree, not that that's always a bad thing (especially these days, with Georgie Jr. in the White House). The surreality of the film makes all sorts of symbolic interpretation possible, and you could definitely argue that the exploitation and torture of Grace at the hands of the ignorant townspeople is a definite criticism of American xenophobia and treatment of immigrants.Von Trier definitely has some valid points, but too often it feels like he's sermonizing, wagging his finger at us even though he admits he's never even been to America (he's afraid of flying). Still, pompousness aside, Von Trier has some good points and an extremely powerful way of dramatizing them. The film's very violent conclusion (the stage lights turn bright red) is one of the most disturbing I think I've ever seen, partly because of the surprising Christ-like symbolism that suddenly comes into play. So, as I was saying, I stumbled out of the theater, feeling all kinds of things at once. I was disturbed and saddened by the conclusion, I was in awe of the performances, I had admiration for Von Trier's vision at the same time that I was angry with him for the cruelty of his story and for some of its anti-American sentiments, which felt unfair to me.After sleeping on it, though, I've come to the conclusion that it IS a good movie. Not perfect, certainly not an ENJOYABLE movie, and I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone except the most adventurous filmgoers, but it's got ideas, powerful performances (the huge cast also includes Lauren Bacall, Ben Gazzara, Patricia Clarkson, Stellan Skarsgaard, Philip Baker Hall, Chloe Sevigney, Jeremy Davies, Zeljko Ivanek, and James Caan), and it's haunted my memories for the last 24 hours. That means that, at the very least, it'll get to you.",Dogville
75,danielll_rs,This quiet little town is much closer to us than we'd like to (**** out of ****),10,4 July 2004,"DOGVILLE (2003)**** out of ****There weren't many great film on the 2003 Cannes Film Festival, but at least three of them deserved to win an award. First, there was Gus Van Sant's ELEPHANT, with its daring and original approach to a real-life event. There was also Clint Eastwood's masterpiece MYSTIC RIVER, which went on to win two Academy Awards in 2004. But it was DOGVILLE the true star of that festival. Unfortunately, it didn't win anything- I suppose that was because its pessimistic, radical view of the human nature might not have pleased some members of the jury. That's a pity, because this is a film to enter the history of cinema.With its unusual set design (chalk drawings on the floor to represent houses, only a few objects) and its anti-Hollywood structure (a narrator who knows a lot, the division of the story in chapters), it might repel some viewers. But that all makes DOGVILLE unique. While Nicole Kidman's performance is the best of her career, the most discussed thing about the film will be its ending. Well, all I can say is that Lars Von Trier has guts- the finale tells more about ourselves than we'd like to.No doubt here's a new addition to my all-time top 100. It's the best film since David Lynch's MULHOLLAND DRIVE.",Dogville
76,kergillian,A BRILLIANT film!!,9,25 March 2005,"Lars Von Trier has finally hit the masterpiece. I have to admit that I had until now appreciated Von Trier's film philosophy, but never got into the films themselves. I admittedly haven't seen what is supposed to be his best (Breaking the Waves), but I thought Dancer in the Dark, for example, was a horrible film - overly long, poorly acted, and unnecessarily boring and dreary - and Italian For Beginners was amusing, but hardly an instant classic.That said, I went into Dogville with an open mind. The brilliant cast and fascinating subject matter (and the rumours I'd been hearing about the film) equaled the long screening time and Von Trier's history. I noticed a high number of walkouts during the premiere, but that didn't surprise me. Many people have a LOT of trouble watching a film that is highly intellectual and has little in the way of fast-paced action or high- drama. This film is not about America, it is about the world. It is about humanity, and the levels of degradation we can sink to. It's about the mistreatment of our neighbors and of strangers. it is about a decline in basic civility and social 'grace'.This film is anti-Dogme; instead of an all-natural film we have one that is purely artificial. Where everything is pared down and exposed. This is very significant considering the subject matter. The sets are refreshingly unique, the acting stellar, and even through a 3-hour sitting I barely noticed the time passing by. The end credits were just icing on a beautifully constructed cake.I recommend this film to EVERYONE. if you're uncomfortable or have trouble with this film, force yourself to watch it, to think critically about it and to discuss it. A solid 9/10.",Dogville
77,matija-trost,REVENGE IN DOG-HELL,5,10 February 2004,"Dogville. A small American city (well, the truth is, it could be anywhere in the world) in the late thirties of past century: population 15. 15 rednecks. With a friendly faces and evil character. And 1 fugitive. Nicole. And a genius director who provided us the show. Lars. And to tell you the truth, it was nothing I expected. Sure the cast and directing is so good, that you soon forgot that you're watching a theatre play. A play that is becoming a harder and harder to watch. A play that you wish you cold reach out and twist the necks of people that are torturing Grace. Or choose an easy way. To walk out of cinema. But hey, you wouldn't do that, because after all, the stories with such a narrators voice must have happy ending (just remember The Babe). And yet, a revenge is always sweet, here in particular. So, does this masterpiece deserves 10/10. From all point of views, yes, but since it was one of the movies i nearly suffered during the show (meaning 1/10) and promise not to see it again, the only fair rate would be5 out of 10 (plus a ""masterpiece"" mark)",Dogville
78,diand_,A tale of morality,8,17 August 2005,"Is this a tale about the loss of humanity as an individual suffers from the power of group behavior? Is it a about an idealist / philosopher unable to handle events and see the tragedy around him? Is this a scathing attack on the social conditions in the US? Or is it about the New World reversing power roles with the Old World? Is it a biblical allegory? Or an autobiographical description of Von Trier's life?Dogville, made as a staged play and inspired by the song Pirate Jenny by Bertolt Brecht, is all, making not the structure of the tale set in a Colorado mining town complex, but its interpretation. Like in Breaking the Waves, Von Trier uses the literature reference, dividing the movie in chapters to tell his tale of an individual becoming victim of group behavior, this time combined with the idealist / intellectual standing by and having no solutions on offer. It all watches like a Greek tragedy, the Greek names of the children of Vera and Chuck only confirming this.The biblical parts are thrown in with the dog Moses, as guardian of the Ten Commandments which are severely transgressed by the citizens of Dogville. The dog can only be seen at the end and is spared. We have the name of the main character Grace and her treatment comparable to that of Jesus; the blindness and the window; the seven figurines broken by Vera stand both for her seven children and the seven sins. Also the Old and New Testament (father and daughter in the car having different interpretations of morality) are touched upon, and Tom representing the betrayal of Judas.The concept of power plays an important part throughout the movie. The line of power starts with Tom, convincing the citizens of Dogville to give Grace a place to hide. As the philosopher, writer and spiritual leader of Dogville he is unable to cope with the basic problem of keeping mankind under control, he is shown as a theoretic, not someone who has practical solutions and fails as an authority (the practical engineer only adds to the misery here as he only makes instruments of oppression). Later the power is taken on by the group to commit the atrocities shown. Dogville is therefore also a warning about letting ignorant and simple minded people take on authority and decisions as there can be horrific consequences. At the end Grace's father comes in and Grace assumes the power from him. All misuse and are unable to handle the concept of power to proper use, the power of Grace and her father is mafia power after all (there is a hint the movie uses that the power of the US has grown out of criminal power, a common historical misunderstanding). The US State is unable to prevent anything of it happening here, it can only be heard in the distance or seen shortly when the police arrives (a prison and police force is the only thing the state offers in the movie). Dogville starts with a speech to be heard on the radio made by the President of the US; the radio is turned off before he starts talking. The end credits with the pictures give way to interpretations of the lack of a proper welfare state in the US, at least at the time of the Depression.Another moral issue arises in the most important dialog in the movie between Grace and her father. At first Grace is incapable to condemn the villagers. Her father calls that arrogance, because she should judge others by the same moral standards as she judges herself. She changes mind after thinking about this concept of morality, judgment and punishment. The whole view on mankind in Dogville is extremely dark: As you make yourself dependent of other people, they will always misuse that opportunity and take advantage of your weaknesses. Later Grace forgets all notions of forgiveness.Another interesting addition and layer comes when Tom suddenly takes on the role of Von Trier himself (the point where he talks about the trilogy). So in reality Von Trier sees himself in the role of Tom. And he makes a deliberate parody of himself, because the harsh and demanding way he treats actresses is in a way comparable to the treatment of Grace.Technically the movie is well shot with the camera-work of Anthony Dod Mantle. When Grace is raped for the first time, the camera retracts and it diminishes on purpose the impact of that scene. By showing inhuman acts without barriers like walls and doors they show how ignorant people usually are about them. But the best shot technically is from Grace under a blanket in the truck, it has surreal qualities.Two side notes: The beautiful music is by Vivaldi ('Cum dederit dilectus suis somnum' (IV) from 'Nisi dominus' RV 608).

80,frankgaipa,Slightly at Odds Idealisms,10,21 March 2005,"My initial slight objection to this brilliant effort by von Trier and, especially, Kidman was that the dark change in the middle chapters comes too easily or too abruptly. It feels ""written,"" rather than lived. So does the grand, brilliant change in Kidman in the final chapter feel ""written"" and ""acted."" But Dogville was, of course, both written and acted. None of the actors ever quite hides foreknowledge of the script's later turnings. I don't think von Trier wholeheartedly meant them to. Even if they'd been able to, the gaps between von Trier's ten chapters, smoothed by sardonic narration, absorb some of the jolt.All through, even at the very beginning, Grace's submission to Tom carries a hint of condescension. She is after all a city girl, a moll of some sort, so they think, their inferior perhaps but not exactly.In the end, but no less at that very beginning, Dogville is about, and Dogville's citizens witness, condone, and abhor the clash between Tom Edison's and Grace's at least slightly at odds idealisms.",Dogville
81,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,Enter The Void,8,23 December 2013,"Of the four Lars Von Trier films that I've watched to date this was the first, and on reflection, still the best, and easily surpasses the 'sequel' Manderlay (which I also liked), Antichrist and the divine Melancholia.It's a profound piece of work that will have you marvelling at the depravity of human beings by its end. We huddle together in our little groups in all classes of society, condemning outsiders. It's happened to and against me, but not to this extent. We're strong as a group but weak as individuals - that's the only excuse for the spineless actions of the Dogville community as a whole, besides fear.I was sceptical about Nicole Kidman at first. She's too well-known for such an intricate piece I thought, but I was wrong - she's clearly brilliant. The lack of props, even for a stage play, is something I've never experienced at this level before, but it's not an element that carries forward as it progresses or detrimental to overall enjoyment of the story. It's sparse and harsh, which is the desired effect, I guess.A very thought provoking piece of work that requires viewer commitment to get through the first half-an-hour due to its lack of pace and absence of visual stimuli.",Dogville

The strong survives, the faster comes first, more assertive one succeeds faster and so on. What else? These situations actually represent and answer to another question - why the good apples are eaten by pigs (this is the original poster of the film, showing the beautiful and seductive Nicole Kidman lying in a cart full of apples)? The entire film was shot on a set no larger than the size of a school football pitch. It presents a small district in the style of colonizing America, all lined with chalk in places where there are houses and streets.

83,jcanettis,"Minimalistic, Interesting, and Thought-Provoking",8,12 January 2004,"""Dogville"" is a movie quite different from what we are used to see. The atmosphere is utterly minimalistic and theater-like: For example, the ""buildings"" are actually areas demarcated by chalk-scribblings within which a couple of elementary pieces of furniture are located. The action takes place within this ""stage"" and there is nothing else to be seen.In this environment, the 16 main characters that constitute the movie (excluding some occasional outsiders such as policemen and gangsters), i.e. the fugitive Grace (Nicol Kidman) and the Dogville residents, are portrayed in an extremely powerful way; indeed, the absence of the usual constituents of a film (scenes, visual effects, etc.) magnifies each personality and his/her interactions with Grace. This a film about the human character, and actually for the dark side of the human character: The way the villagers gradually expose their nasty elements (greed, contempt, lust) towards their ""protege"" is telling. The characters are portrayed wonderfully, and Nicol Kidman again proves her undisputed talent.In the end, despite the long-awaited catharsis, the film leaves the viewer with a melancholic feeling: The movie loudly reminds us that despite appearances people ARE bad, and it just takes the right opportunity for them to show their true nature.A very good movie, yet one that might alienate several people due to its highly minimalistic scenery I explained above.

84,stevetseitz,"An interesting exercise or should I say ""illustration""",7,5 March 2005,"By making a fool of the character ""Tom"" in his film of ""Dogville"", Lars Von Triers also can't help but make a fool of himself with this exercise. By taking the same distanced approach to his study on human cruelty, the director ends up effectively holding a mirror to the artist rather than at society.His story is forced and artificial by any stretch even before the cinematic trickery of the huge sound stage taking the place of realistic locations. The tiny number of people in a cramped setting (to call it a town would be generous) Film is a medium of movement (as Kurosawa proved to great effect) and on this test Von Triers fails miserably.It's almost as if he was too lazy to craft a real film out of the bare bones of a story. My opinion is that if one wants to set out to capture the drama of the theater, one should write and direct a play.This is not to say that the actors don't do a terrific job in their respective roles. Kidman is amazing and proves how formidable an actress she is once again. Also excellent is Stellan Skarsgard as a gruff farmer.In many ways, watching these great performances without location shooting or even realistic sets made this film seem like a rehearsal instead of a finished product. Lars needs to quit trying to be so clever and start making films instead of pretentious nonsense. I am a huge fan and expected more. This is yet another case proving that film festival awards mean nothing.The dim view of human nature is certainly a pessimistic and narrow view with which to view our fellow man. It doesn't surprise me that someone with such a low opinion of his audience would fail to provide them with a finished product. As usual, I realize there will be countless ""film nerds"" out there just chomping at the proverbial bit to lavish praise on this film because it is, well, pretentious. How do I know? I used to BE ONE. These ""film nerds"" make themselves feel better about their lack of lives by enjoying films that the average audience disdains or ignores completely. Their argument is that because it is ""different"" it is somehow good. A feeble argument at best and certainly no reason to watch a film.",Dogville

Which fits perfectly, since he tries to show the naked truth of what people are.Now, it is a bit extreme. And I hope the film isn't saying this always is the truth. But to deny that people can be like this, completely selfish and purely hypocritical. Then you're one of those going trough life with your eyes firmly shut. Especially if you think that you yourself, never could be like this.Movies like this are some of the absolute best. It's not a movie aimed to entertain. It's art, trying to tell a deep truth of the human psyche and nature. Although, these attempts can be pretentious, boring and pointless. Because we watch movies to be entertained.

86,Det_McNulty,"A Film Far From Appealing To A Mass Audience, One Of The Strangest Film Structures Ever",7,19 July 2006,"Dogville is very different to most films you will see and the fact is it is not afraid to be that way. Dogville is intriguing, disturbing, depressing and hypnotic. This image of a town that resembles next to nothing and is left for the viewer to imagine is one that is original or as some might put it ""pretenious"". Of course on the outside Dogville seems a very nice place, full of kind people and that's all it is on the outside.You see the idea of the audience have to watch a half made set piece may be strange, but it shows the fact that in this tiny town nobody can hide away their secrets. Everybody has to be kind on the outside to hide their evil and sorrow that has been dwelling inside themselves. You see nothing is quite what it seems in this twisting story. Nothing happens until the very last minute, I found myself gripped with suspense from start to finish.Nicole Kidman manages to give a spellbinding performance as Grace the kind hearted lady who is running from the modern life. She wants to find something better for herself and ends up finding that really anywhere you go people are not as pure as they first seemed and rather fuelled by greed and corruption. Nicole Kidman gives a vivid and detailed performance, easily her best in years and she has been cast perfectly.You've also got the classic actors such as James Caan who believe it or not plays a gangster. You could say that was slightly ""type cast"", but he actually manages to pull off his performance with a great ease and you forget the fact he has played similar characters in the past. So once again James Caan proves a talent that reminisces the almighty performance of Sonny Corleone back in 1972. Paul Bettany also gives a career changing role as the town's ""leader"" and pulls it off with great attitude and intensity.Dogville is a lot of like a bitter poem or a fable showing the ills of society. Some have even said it's Lars von Trier's Anti-American movie, but that's up for the viewer to decide. I can be certain though that the film is brutally honest at depicting the downfalls of society and the dark side of human nature. Not only is Dogville a film that mystifies the viewer it manages to change from being a charming film to a dark tale of the ills of society.The film is separated into sections which perfectly underline the change from the problems facing this women. Dogville is a very brave piece of contemporary cinema because it is not afraid to be controversial. The film echoes revenge, lust, anger and sexual deprivation. There is a underlining sexual tension that weaves through the movie. Dogville is very slow paced, but perfectly fitting for a film of it's kind. The film is a work of art, I have never before seen a film where I felt as though I was sitting in a theatre (The film relies on a basic set-piece) and watching actors act. The illustration is one that is nothing like what I've seen on screen before and mixes so much emotional complexity that it makes room for repeat viewings.The film feels very un-edited through this style of direction and the beautiful imagery such as when Nicole Kidman lies in the truck by the apples is one of the few different styled scenes. The movie follows a pattern and sticks out, the narration that plays throughout the film adds a feeling as if you are listening to a story tape and comes to a very strange un-nerving kind of effect. The voice is very ""storylike"" and provides a detailed analysis of each character who are all really the same people on the inside. Dogville is a film that will make you think, it is intelligent and thoughtful and constructed in a way that demands the viewer to keep their eyes glued to the screen.I doubt you'll ever see a film that's quite the same and that is what makes it one of the most creative and original works of art in recent years.

I found it to be irritating and annoying film.I didn't like the narration. I didn't like the set and the(no)location.I didn't like the characters.The film is much too long and the length of the film doesn't help. The idea that human nature is bad from basic is an idea that has been explored in the past and has been done in a better and more interesting way. The only thing that save the film from being a total disaster is the acting and the chance to see some old faces(long not to be seen on the silver screen) among the actors.

Or convenient, given the gangster theme?However, one - and definitely not the only - reading of this though puts Kidman as Christ, and Caan as God, and the whole film as an allegory of his/her treatment at the hands of the human race, I think. It's very interestingly done, with a great voiceover from John Hurt, and a whole heap of good acting - not least from Kidman herself - although I still remain unconvinced by Paul Bettany.

He is one of the few interesting directors working in film today. He is unpredictable and always worth a watch. Still, Dogville fell short of my expectations...forced and not believable, not one of its characters rang true(perhaps they should have been props as well)... all is a slave to ideology.By the time James Caan appears in the back of the Cadillac all I could think was 'I guess Al Pacino said ""No"" '. I even had difficulty being offended by it although I did get a laugh out of the end credits...imagine, a story about a village (country) taking advantage of a vulnerable refugee, turning them over to the authorities after treating them in a sub-human way, only to have a firestorm come down upon them and destroy their village ( I think that actually happened somewhere in a big way last century) and it happens in ... America! of all places. Not that America is anything close to perfect...but I find being lectured to by an Aryan on the subject of intolerance the absolute height of arrogance (as long as we're playing the guilt-by-association game).Still and all a very admirable try, worth watching as I'm sure his next work will be.",Dogville
90,tjsdshpnd,Human behavior can be more frightening than horror movies,9,5 January 2014,"Director : Lars Von TrierI have not felt so many different emotions after watching a movie for a long long time. Dogville is brilliant not only because it's shows us the frailties of human nature, but also because it does not shy away from showing the methods to deal with them. The opening shot itself grips you and then you are hooked to this 3 hour movie, which is not in any way a deterrent, because of the way the movie is narrated and it's theater play like filming. The movie is narrated in 9 parts along with an prologue, in almost a novel like flow which encapsulates the mind of the viewer till the end. The parts are precisely named and described which helps to know exactly what to expect ahead, still it manages to shock you. The director decided to shoot the entire movie on the stage using stage props and lighting. It may seem weird and hard to accept initially, but the lack of a proper location, is advantageous for this kind of cinema where more focus is given to the human emotions.The variety of human emotions and the complexity of human relations is the most shocking and revelatory part of this movie. How do humans exploit other human's weakness and unleash the hidden vultures from inside them is shocking to say the least. There are so few characters in the movie which are confined in such a small place, that you cannot help but feel the hostility. How can anyone survive this place is the thought that lingers in the mind as new chapters keep unfolding. This is one of those movies where the human behavior is so scary that it will haunt me for some days even more than a ghost horror movie could. The ending is also such that will leave anyone short of words. On the acting front, Nicole Kidman may have played the greatest role of her life. The variety of emotions she portrays is applaudable. You sympathize with her but also hate her for bearing all this and being ""too"" good. In the climax, I felt like giving her a standing ovation and then felt bad about myself. It is that kind of a movie. The other cast has also played their parts to perfection and everyone will remain in your thoughts after the movie ended. Was good to see screen legends Lauren Bacall and James Caan after a long time even though in minuscule roles. In conclusion, I would want to ask one question, would the movie would have been any different if the fugitive seeking a refuge would not have been beautiful Nicole Kidman, but a middle aged man, or maybe a less attractive woman? Anyways, this movie will linger for some time at least in my mind.Rating : 9/10",Dogville
91,Teknofobe70,An incredibly important film.,9,24 February 2004,"If you don't already know, the interesting thing about Dogville is that there are no real sets. It all takes place in a theatre where the individual houses in the village of marked out with chalk and labelled, and there are even boxes with ""Dog"" or ""Gooseberry Bushes"" written on them -- the only things that appear are generally props which are actually used in the film. From a practical, film-making point of view this means that von Trier can show whats going on in all the houses at any time, and also he can show the whole town and all the people from overhead, as if some great god was looking down on them, which is a device he uses several times.Many people presume that Von Trier was attempting to make the film something like a play, but I definitely felt that he is more blurring the line between a film and a book. Tarantino attempted the same thing with ""Kill Bill"", but not to this visionary extent. This film is also divided into chapters, but he takes it further by including summaries of the events as a novelist might, and it also has a narrative throughout that sounds an awful lot like writing from a literary novel. The fact that there are no sets also makes it a lot like reading a book, in that you have to use your imagination. If a writer failed to describe the buildings of a town in a book, your imagination might conjure up something that looks like Dogville.What I'm trying to explain is that I feel this is something more than just a clever gimmick, it is a device of some importance and hopefully other artists will take inspiration from von Trier's vision. But this is not something inherent in the writing of the film -- it could just as easily have been filmed in a conventional way, with actual sets and all, and it still would have been worth watching.And so, onto the film itself. It is a heavily philosophical piece of work, and the writing and the dialogue is very strong throughout. I felt somewhat let down by the ending, but I won't give too much away there. This is not an easy film to watch, but hardly anything that is shown is gratituous -- von Trier doesn't linger on anything, in fact, for longer than is necessary. It also seems that the fact that the actors have to use their imagination more than usual has definitely brought out the best in them. The two leads, Kidman and Bettany, are both excellent in their roles, as is the entire supporting cast.It's a film you should see if you're interesting in it as a form of art, and I'm sure in time it'll be shown on pretty much any self-respecting film course. As far as people who watch films solely for entertainment go, I'm not sure how much you'll like it. Not because there are no sets, as you practically forget this after about an hour has gone in the same way you imagine what isn't there when watching a stageplay, but because of the harshness of the story itself. I only hope that it can be appreciated, and that a general audience of Nicole Kidman fans when it's released in US theatres doesn't reduce the film's rating too much.",Dogville

The only downside to this film is the length, but had someone told me it was 150% worth it, I would've watched it without multitasking during some parts. Pay attention, the narrative is witty and the script is amazing.Without spoiling the film, not much can be said about the plot, but enjoy it for what it is, and then some.Beautifully done, BEAUTIFUL.(Please be aware that you cannot compare the work of Lars von Trier with that of his other films due to the meaning behind each.

93,McBuff,Filmed theater to the nth degree.,4,9 September 2003,"The term photographed stageplay must have been invented for movies like this. For those who found the Dogme films too flashy and hi-tech, Von Trier has stripped his style down to the bare necessities. Filmed on one set in which an entire village is marked with chalked lines and only a minimal use of props. Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mysterious woman who flees to a small town in the Rockies, Dogville, during the Depression years. At first the villagers are kind and hospitable, but eventually they start taking advantage of her, because of her predicament. The tragedy is inevitable, and the finale violent and surprising. And that's the problem.The film didn't have the emotional impact on me that I was led to believe from the positive advance words Dogville received on the Cannes festival. The bizarrely constructed style and artificiality of the whole thing mute whatever true emotions might have emerged had the film been made ""traditionally"" (for lack of a better word). All the more so, when the end credits with authentic photographs of Depression-era America accompanied by David Bowie's THE YOUNG AMERICANS, has a far more powerful effect than anything preceding them. First in a trilogy (U, S and A), to be followed by Manderlay and Wasington (not a typo!) Widely praised, and if you buy into the conceit, your rating may be higher.

Guys, how can you give away so much in your comments? Routinely these days, I'll try to find a movie that is rumoured to be good, but about which I know nothing and go and watch it cold. I knew absolutely nothing about this movie other than a certain starry actress was in it (and she was definitely not my reason for seeing this, generally speaking, I find her mannerisms a tad annoying, and her acting a shade unorganic and plastic). Due to my fortunate lack of intelligence of what to expect, I had the pleasure of.. well find out for yourselves! One caveat, this is an intellectual movie, the Hollywood brat audience will be bored to tears as the movie is nearly 3 hours and demands a certain investment on the part of the viewer to accept an uneasy switch from certain movie conventions. The comments of people that disliked this movie seem to be rather lame, and scribed in the very style that Dogville might have a certain disagreement with :) If the movie is anti-this or anti-that, then so much the better! The gods save us if political correctness means all movies/art are supposed to be uncontroversial and ""fair"" as has happened to dreary Hollywood (Mind you, a very different, much more insidious propaganda is at work in the Hollywood products). Dogville is recommended! 9/10 for entertainment, 10/10 for that rare fizz: innovation. *Minor SPOILER* - the said protagonist actress's acting was the least convincing of the assembled thesps, though she was probably the most watchable, pleasant and charismatic creature most of the time. But another case of the star that spoiled the ointment? It's a very minor grumble, but she was the weakest link. I wish audiences and producers could resist stars. Anyway this is an exaltedly remarkable movie. Toodlepip! Eadon",Dogville

With no walls, no boundary, the viewers could see so many social environment at one time, provoking every wild perspective. Some scenes taken with presice set piece of camera works. Because in this kind of cinematography concept, camera positioning is a key, but it successfully made it.The lead actress is really flawless. Potraiting cold, calm, and mysterious character. The acting is really charming. Provoking human emotion such as sadness, lovable, lust, toughess, and anger. She has very broad skill of characterization of many human emotion.Overall, Dogville is a unique and well-made movie with flawless performance of it's lead actress.",Dogville
96,tbyrne4,"Fairly interesting movie, a little overrated",7,20 February 2006,"Typically interesting film from von Trier, who always takes big risks. No exception here. ""Dogville"" is basically a stageplay. Strange girl wanders into a small town, is the welcomed by the town, then exploited by the town. The ""town"", which we never leave the confines of, being nothing more than a bare soundstage with chalk marks for houses and streets. A brazen idea. Something only a European filmmaker would attempt. I could just see a Hollywood director trying to pitch the idea to the studio heads at Columbia Pictures (yea right). The miraculous part is that it never grows boring. It's a three hour movie, but it only sags at the very end (and then only slightly).Nice performances all around. Kidman is excellent. Unfortunately, there's not a whole to say otherwise about the movie. It's stating a ""truism"" about human nature (from a pessimistic viewpoint, remember), but big deal. I'm not saying I disagree with his viewpoint, I'm just not convinced von Trier knows exactly what it is he's trying to say. What are you left with? A number of striking images (not many though). von Trier is a wild stylist. A total risk-taker and this is just another one of his wild ideas. Not saying it doesn't work. It just doesn't work as well as ""Breaking the Waves"" or ""Zentropa"" or even the equally overrated ""Dancer in the Dark"".What the film reminded me of a little is some of Sam Shepard's writing. In particular, the novelty of Kidman chained to that wheel. In fact, her having the cowbell around her neck is kind of a rip-off of the story in ""Paris, Texas"" (written by Shepard) that Harry Dean Stanton tells about the guy who tied the cowbell around the girl's neck so she couldn't run away. Same mental image.Good movie, just not one of von Trier's best. Check out ""Breaking the Waves"" or ""Zentropa"".",Dogville

98,dav07dan02,gives us a grim outlook on humanity,9,9 November 2005,"Director/Script: Lars Von Trier, Cast: Nicole Kidman (Grace), Paul Bettany(Tom Edison), Lauren Bacall (Ma Ginger), Jeremy Davis (Bill Hensen), Chloe Sevigny (Liz Hensen), Ben Gazzara (Jack Mckay), Blair Brown (Mrs. Henson), Patricia Clarkson (Vera), Philip Baker Hall (Tom Edison Sr.), Harriet Andersson (Gloria), Siobhan Fallon (Martha), Zeljko Ivanek (Ben), Cleo King (Oliva), Bill Raymond (Mr. Henson), Stellan Skarsgard (Chuck), Shauna Shim (June), John Hurt (Narrator) This very unique and controversial film is a study of human characters. The main character in this film is Gloria. She runs away from her gangster lord father because she does not like the injustices she had seen him inflict on people. Finally free, she ends up at a small village in the Colorado Rockies called 'Dogville'. She is taken in by these seemly hospitable, friendly country folk. They agree to a trial stay of two weeks with the understanding that she will perform simple chores for the town folk in exchange for her stay. What we are shown as time goes on is that these people are no better than her father's gangsters. The injustice they inflict on her is just as bad as the injustices her father had inflicted on people. The townspeople do not know about her secret past. They are going to pay for their injustices.This film is not like any other I have seen. It is not a motion picture but a filmed stage play. As such, it is very plot driven. The powerful performances of the actors makes up for the lack of scenery. It is a film that forces you to use your imagination much like reading a novel. I was thinking about this film for a long time after I saw it. Many people perceive this as an Anti- American film. Lars Von Trier is a Danish film maker and I have heard that he holds anti-American views. The setting for this story is the depression era of the 1930's. As the credits roll at the film's end, actual depression era photographs are shown while the Bowie song 'Young Americans' plays. I actually think the setting of this film is irrelevant. What happened in this town could have happened anywhere in the world. I think what Von Trier was trying to show is that most people are s**t and not to be trusted. The fact that just about everyone in the town exploits her is evidence of this. He does not portray humanity in a very positive light.I thought the performances in this film was top rate. It took a little bit of watching to get used to this style of film making but after a while you get so into the acting that it doesn't matter that the movie is filmed on a stage with simple sets. I actually think it worked in the films favor. This was a very dark film with some shocking moments. It is amazing how Von Trier and all the performers where able to pull it off without all the fancy production. I think Nicole Kidman gives one of her best performances here. Lauren Bacall, a seasoned actress who was very striking in her time, plays Ma Ginger. Other notable actors in this film were Ben Gazzara and Chloe Sevigny. Every actor was outstanding.",Dogville
99,DAHLRUSSELL,"10 for artistry, 4 for story",7,25 October 2006,"Von Trier is definitely an artist who works on film and who appreciates theatre and theatre actors. Truly brilliant and great.Dogville is an unrelentingly depressing piece. Using a film studio like a black box stage, the production here is unique, fantastic, and eerily beautiful.Unfortunately, the story makes noir look bright by comparison; with a conclusion that all people are vile and selfish at heart. If you want to convince yourself that now is the night for suicide, here's your film. Any story elements are trumped by the production as a whole, but I get very tired of rape being used as a plot device and a stand in for the ills of society instead of really creating a more full story. Even though I did not like the dark vision, I do expect the author to be true to it, and the end of this film felt like a total sell out. Nicole Kidman, both highly regarded and yet still underrated actress of incredible gifts slinks through the abstract town in a long black cloak like Skeletor. The cast is peopled with big name stars and familiar faces who clearly wanted to do this ensemble piece as a rare chance to flex their legit acting chops, but this would have fared better with stage actors with ""unknown"" faces who don't carry the baggage of having been on the cover of ""Vanity Fair"" last month, especially the ubiquitous Clarkson and the always leaden Chloe Sevigny. One joy of watching film is being able to joyfully extol the film you've just seen. I can only recommend this film to two actor friends who like extreme work, and even so, I have to warn them it is a hateful story. It is a real disappointment that our most brilliant artists are focusing with such narrow vision on the worst the world has to offer. I understand this is a trilogy. I'll pass on the other parts.",Dogville
100,trescia-1,Evil Film,1,26 June 2009,"Dogville is a well made film, but that just makes it all the more vile because the sentiments expressed in it are evil. True, Dogville exercises Von Trier's freedom of expression and he may not intend that any of it should be taken seriously, but so what? Von Trier crosses a line in Dogville that should not be crossed. Claiming that his freedom and his sense of humor trump his indecency is a kind of thinking that is evil in essence. Like involuntary manslaughter, Von Trier's crime is still heinous even if it lacks premeditation.Von Trier has made a movie that invokes a feeling of cold, detached hatred for human beings. A feeling of being superior and ""above them."" A feeling of pitiless detachment from the ""insects"" (no longer human) squirming about on the screen. Those silly ""things"" squeaking and rolling in the dirt. Those ""sub-humans"" who hurt and rape and maim, and might even hurt or rape or maim you and I (!) if they aren't ""controlled"" by eugenic policy or some other final solution.It's a good feeling, isn't it? Hate, like a soft little worm coiled up in your heart, while you enjoy imagining how those ""Dogville"" inhabitants should be treated, and then watching them get just what they deserve!It's practically orgasmic.But it's hatred that you are feeling. In the 1930's, in Germany, The National Socialist Workers' Party used EXACTLY this kind of ""ironic"" hatred to take control. Most of their enemies were taken off-guard. Many said ""they can't be serious"" and the intellectuals (who would go to the concentration camps) laughed at Hitler. They thought it was all so amusing, at first.Don't believe me? Google it! Look up Joseph Goebbels' speeches on YouTube and watch him grinning while he uses the word ""propoganda"" and listen to the audience laugh! It was all so funny! At least it was for a while...This movie is full of Nazi ideas and, while I don't blame ignorant people for falling into his trap, you won't BE ignorant after you read this. You'll know. Nazi ideas can be expressed ""ironically"" and they have exactly the same effect. ""Irony"" is not a defense nor an explanation for promoting the savagery in this film. Von Trier has spent a great deal of time and money promoting these ideas. He may not even know that he's repeating the work of Goebbels and Adolf Hitler. But that's not an excuse.Nazi ideas work their evil even if they are not to be taken seriously. That means that some thoughts cannot be portrayed, even as abstract exercises in stagecraft. If that sounds like censorship, then you will be unhappy to know that much of world has outlawed the swastika, and hate speech, and holocaust denial. Yes, that is censorship. But the Nazi menace requires censorship. ""Free speech"" does not apply to Nazi ideas. I wish it weren't true--oh how I wish that Hitler and his creations never existed. But they did.And if you disagree, you'll probably find this entire little essay to be comical. So go ahead and laugh at how silly I am. Just like they did so many years ago, in Germany.SUPER SPOILER WARNING (This gives away the ""surprise ending"")Finally, for those who just don't get where I'm coming from, I'll spell it out. The citizens of Dogville seem like ""hillbillies"" but they represent ""The Jews."" They are exploiting a ""fair blonde maiden."" They are exterminated at the end of the film by machine guns. The town is burned like cities in Poland. The motive for this crime is not revenge, it is portrayed as the eradication of vermin. Deliberate cruelty is portrayed as a kind of catharsis. Get it?",Dogville
101,bastard_wisher,Von Trier's folly,5,19 December 2004,"i must say i found ""Dogville"" somewhat disappointing, especially considering that i've been championing Lars Von Trier for a while. I was totally aware beforehand of the whole sound-stage thing, in fact it's one of the things i was most interested in the film about, but i never once imagined how intrusive it would really be. I'd call it a gimmick except that i think highly enough of Von Trier to assume that he had a reason for doing it that way. But in any case it didn't help my enjoyment of the film any, that's for sure. Not that it's the only problem i had with the film. I also thought that the staginess of the whole thing seemed to somewhat affect the actor's performances as well, making them more theatrical than natural. Although i guess this could also be in part because most of the characters weren't actually three-dimensional people as much as symbols, which is true of all of Von Trier's more recent films, but in this case it was somewhat enhanced by the theatrical presentation and the overall lack of the high-intensity emotionalism of ""Breaking the Waves"" and ""Dancer in the Dark"", which is probably the thing that bothered me most about the film. Wereas those previous films were very intense, emotional character studies on top of being parables, ""Dogville"" lacked the dramatics and thus all the audience is left with is a rather heavy-handed sermon. Luckily, in this case Von Trier was preaching to the choir on my part, so this aspect of the film bothered me less than it might otherwise have, although i must admit the point he was trying to make was pretty much all there was to the film, and it was the same point being made over and over again throughout the film, and none-too-subtly either. In this sense the dramatics of ""Breaking the Waves"" and ""Dancer in the Dark"" resulted in a subtler approach, at least to some extent. Not to mention that the message of ""Dogville"" was basically the same as ""Dancer in the Dark"" to begin with. This was another problem i had with the film, that basically it seemed like recycled ideas from the ""Golden Hearts"" trilogy. Which, if it turns out is a continuing trend in ""Mandarlay"", will make me question the necessity of the ""America"" trilogy at all.",Dogville
102,meissotruey,Lars von Trier puts on a play,9,16 July 2020,"Solid direction, scene setting, high level acting, amazing booklike narration, unconventional script development and its quality. 9/10 as play, 8/10 as a movie. It is impossible to make instant judgement, because we can rate it either like script released on theater stage, or like an ordinary movie. It is definitely more relatable to plays, but most viewers expect and perceive something more movielike. I suppose, it could be hardly realized better, but the initial idea of the play and it's presentation still questions me. Feels like i missed some pitfalls. Every detail we see in this movie on paper seems kinda silly or simple, strange or too straightforward(for the great artist, which Mr. Trier undoubtedly is), but the hand of the master spreads all over it. Trier's extreme accuracy allowed him to create this chaining effect, when you can't stop watching. As i am not traditionalist in sense of genre(cause i used to give big rating to the games ""without gameplay"") i gonna rate it as 9, but if you're not ready for the other genre in a shell of a movie, you should know, that it's ""movie rating"" is 8(which is still high and rare to see, especially in my system of grades(for 150 series and movies only 17 products rated 8+, 11 of them rated 8).",Dogville

I didn't leave the room in the hope that as the film went on it would improve and take a fast pace, but man was I wrong.I'm not keen on Hollywood blockbusters (Most of which are lame) but neither am I on endless drags like Dogville. I may like independent stuff as long as it's visible, but this eternal piece should be recommended for people suffering from insomnia. If I had known this movie is totally filmed in what looks like a typical theater stage I would've saved four  or used them to see something better. I don't doubt the people involved in its filming and playing have done a good job, but the whole thing seems too weird - come on, a town in the middle of nowhere with no landscape in sight but darkness, etc...

Even though this film is original and unique and I can't believe it has not been tried before. The performances are great and I can not wait for the other two films in this trilogy.

105,vampiresan,Lars Von Trier the misogynist returns,3,14 January 2004,"With the possible exception of THE IDIOTS, every film I have seen by Trier has been pushing a really disturbing female stereotype.The women are universally portrayed as Martyrs whose self sacrifice is the only option available to them. But their martyrdom is never for themselves but always for a male who directly or indirectly benefits from their stupidity and self sacrifice. In Breaking the Waves and Dancer In The Dark both main female characters allow themselves to be tortured and killed in order to benefit the men in their lives (BTW her husband and DITD Selma's son.)The fact that both sacrifices are completely illogical is ignored. In fact in Breaking The Waves the rape and murder of the main female (Bess) is actually shown to have had the beneficial effect of letting her husband walk again after a terrible accident. in Dogville it seems like Trier has realized this and is willing to look at it. In Dogville he seriously questions these portrayals of self sacrifice, of forgiveness and looks to see where they come from. The final conversation between Grace and her father illustrates this idea beautifully and finally the female archetype, which is essentially what Trier is writing about rather than the female character, acknowledges that these tendencies which society has tried to push upon her and which has given her a false sense of place, security and most importantly superiority, is self deception and leads to her enslavement.But don't be fooled. Von Trier has not turned over a new leaf...Grace is ill used by the townspeople, made to be a sex as well as labour slave and yes Von Trier finally allows her to toss away her martyrdom and enact revenge on the townsfolk who have used her so badly... but.. why... is it for her own empowerment? No. In order to do this Grace becomes the one thing she was running from in the first place - the pawn of her father. She sacrifices herself to him as surely as Bess and Selma sacrificed themselves to their male family members. So the message has been refined not changes - women should find the power to fight against the slavery brought by society but not that by the men in their immediate lives.In BTW and DITD both Selma and Bess also stood up to the cruel bigoted and corrupt men in their society - Bess the church, Selma her landlord whom she killed. But like Grace, once placed in a position where they were asked to surrender to their family they did so willingly.Lars Von Trier is a good technical filmmaker, the form is always interesting, whether using ""dogma"" or Brechtian styles. But h e uses the form to gain comment and the appalling content and theme is often completely ignored. He's a master manipulator but probably not a very nice human being. she doesn't just offer herself up as a sacrifice.",Dogville
106,swillsqueal,Mondo Cane...,7,6 November 2005,"Dogville is Our Town. Time has passed. Our Town looks a bit shabby these days. The set is still sparse. We're more realistic. Maybe we were always more realistic.Our Town is covered in Blue Velvet nowadays. There are dirty little secrets inside. On the surface, we are nice. We will help a Jew, even an immigrant, if they are legal and they don't cost us much. They did no harm. They weren't criminals. We knew that. And so, we let them stay with us. We hid them from the authorities. All we asked was a little something in return. A little labor. They were glad to apply themselves, if we would save them and hide them and shelter them. After all, it wasn't much work and in the final analysis, work is a fair exchange for the wages of fear.Grace (Nicole Kidman) gets wages; well not much, but Dogville's citizens build her a house to live in. One couldn't ask for much more. And Grace is grateful and obedient to a fault. One feels free of the demands of the outside world when one is working. The people who run Dogville don't really need her labour or her skills. After all, they can do their work themselves. They have been doing it since before Grace arrived.Hidden Grace is discovered by the idealist of the town. He is the writer. He is the dreamer. He is pure. He is trying to shed light on goodness. He loves the poor, the unwashed, the hard working citizens of Dogville. God provides for those who take care of themselves. They are His obedient servants and He loves them. Not the writer. He is not God. He is also one of God's obedient servants. I mean, God loves the citizens of Dogville--even if they resemble ""frogs with dirty little lips"". They are good and generous and they help Grace.They have Grace. Grace is theirs to kill or love. Grace is their servant..well, of sorts. They love her. Well, at least, they like her a lot. They let Grace do some of their lighter chores. Grace is obedient. Grace does her chores well. The town seems pleased and begins to brighten as time goes on. From a winter of depression-era discontent, the town passes into a spring, then a summer of cautious, good humour. And Grace? She's grateful.But, the authorities press their case for finding Grace. The town's members begin to feel uneasy. They are, after all, law abiding citizens and they wouldn't want to do anything wrong. But they are also just and as just citizens, Dogville comes to terms with ignoring the policeman's public pleas to pass on any information on the missing Grace to the proper public authorities, by exacting greater toil from their servant. Justice, after all, has to be measured and meted out fairly and crime is in the air. Certainly the citizens of Dogville are not guilty of the crime and Grace is the focus of the missing person's posters and so crime must be followed by punishment. Everyone knows that. Even a child, like the one who pleads with Grace to spank him, knows that. The child has behaved badly and knows that for this crime, he must be punished. Grace reluctantly complies and spanks the child. Thus justice is meted out and the delicate, balance of power between dominance and submission is maintained.Submission is good. Any good ideologist will tell you that. The Good Idea should dominate the human being. Tom Edison (Paul Bettany ) will tell you that as he wanders the streets of Dogville or at the meetings he organizes or in the books he plans to write. And Grace is submissive. As pressure and the promise of reward from the authorities grow, the balance of power between Dogville and Grace has to be adjusted.Time passes.....It is winter. Grace has been obedient to every man in town. Power must be serviced. Dogville's bitches don't like her much for that and the temptation to use their knowledge to turn her out of their Eden grows with every day and night which passes, until finally the deed is agreed to.But not before Herr Edison declares his undying love and Grace consents to submit to him in more ideal circumstances. For now, the reality is her chains, complete with a cow bell around her neck for she has had the temerity to attempt an escape. Sure, Tom tried to help by stealing money from his father. Fortunately for Dogville's citizens, there is a Judas around and it is during and after his betraying kisses that she is raped, more or less at will. Sex will not come to the pure of heart though and Tom decides that Grace must go. It's either her or his ideals.Snow falls. Moonlight glows. The authorities arrive. Dogville's citizens have been obedient. Theirs is the power and the glory forever. Our Men....led by the father of Grace give them their just desserts. Even the one-time wage-slave Grace, relishes her new found political power as it comes out the barrel of gun and into her Idealist Lover's skull.""Take a day and walk around. Watch the Nazis run your town. Then, go home and check yourselves. You think we're talking about someone else.

108,thegodfathersaga,out of the norm in just about every way,9,27 November 2012,"this film is out of the norm in just about every way. the narrative work in Lars Von Trier's Dogville is unique and special; told in the form of a prologue and 9 chapters, each inter-title gives away the general idea, in turn showing creativity, versatility and great confidence in raw storytelling ability. provided the setting, which could be a little off- putting at first, this might work brilliantly as a play, but it has everything in it to make a great film of itself.the film is notable for the way it is told and portrayed. the plan to use a theatrical scenery and capture the whole story in one place, makes the film provoke in the viewer a very basic curious sense, and challenges his imaginative capacity and intrinsic perception. the excellent cast faces an unusual task to act naturally around invisible walls and manage to create an engaging environment. thematically, the minimal staging, only reinforces the discomfort and becomes a basis to communicate the film's thesis.Lars Von Trier is a director who's no stranger to controversy with his films and not all people like what he has to say. here, the story is slow paced and lengthy, but it's so compelling that it doesn't matter, because the viewer stays focused, though never trapped.. besides the narrative creativity, Von Trier seeks to meddle in human behavior and cruelty, ultimately bringing the worst out of him. it's a frightening and uncompromising demonstration of the human condition; charity is linked with greed, benevolence with suspicion.. the film argues that there's definitely a limit to selfless generosity.the script is extremely well developed and treats the characters carefully, especially the main character Grace. besides making me fall in love with her, Nicole Kidman is brilliant in her role as an introverted and submissive woman suffering numerous setbacks. pretty much all the rest of the cast is spot on.Dogville is very literal, which makes it seems as if one was reading a book, in terms of conscious involvement. layered and excellent script, with a disturbing ending that is thoughtful and consistent",Dogville

The idea of using a minimalistic setup is truly original, but it never gets catchy; It is a failed attempt to bring theater to the big screen. Actually it is just extremely irritating! The story is okay and is meant to show the true identities of the American people, though I doubt the real Americans act so cruel as the characters in the movie. Judge for yourself.Unless you are a 100% Lars Von Trier fan, I recommend you avoid this annoying movie.I therefore give DOGVILLE 2 out of 10, 1 for Nicole Kidman's great acting, and 1 for the just as great acting for Paul Bettany.",Dogville
110,HunterDK,A successful experiment,7,5 June 2003,"Today I watched Dogville in a Danish cinema, but I did not know what to expect before I went to the cinema.I was aware of the way the town was build with the chalk lines, and I was very sceptical. I am not a big Lars von Trier-fan, even though I have seen several of his works like Riget (The Kingdom) and Idioterne.The whole town was one big scene, where chalk lines marked the houses, and the furniture in the buildings is there for a reason. Things which are not important for the movie have been let out, so the audience do not get distracted and focus on the wrong things. It is a bit hard in the beginning to watch people opening doors which are not there, but you get used to it after about a half to one hour.When you only have one big scene, then the acting is very important to keep the movie going, and the acting is really superb. I cannot say anything bad about the acting, all the actors really did a great job. Most noticeable is of course the acting by Nicole Kidman, but there are also a lot of really experienced actors like James Caan, Philip Baker Hall and Lauren Bacall. The rest of the cast are also really good actors, I would like to give them all some credit.Visually it is also a successful movie, it is really a great view, when you are watching the town from the overview camera. There are also different times of the year, and you can see from the environment what time of the year it is, once more a point where the movie has been successful.Those were the positive things, there are also some negative things about this movie. I have to admit that the movie was maybe a bit too long, there were some periods where I felt that nothing really happened. The movie also failed to make me feel real bad or sad, I just sat and watched the cruelty without being touched that much, some more music might have helped the atmosphere.One of the things the movie has been criticized for is that it was an attack against USA. I am not anti-American, and I still did enjoy watching the lives of the people in the streets. Lars von Trier will surely try to send some messages with this movie, and I think it is healthy - you have the choice to agree or disagree.Dogville was an interesting intellectual movie, and it makes you think about several things. I would like to recommend it, but I do not see it as a master piece, so I will give it 7/10.",Dogville

Let me warn you about this movie: * It's about 3 hours long. * It builds up really slow. * It's disturbing from an emotional point of view. * It's unconventional. * It's not the ideal movie for your movie night.Now let me tell you what's good about this movie. It's like an exercise in psychology and human nature. The ending is THE BEST EVER I ever saw. The movie builds tension again and again and the last 30 minutes are a complete release to it. What's even better, you can't blame her. There is a sense of satisfaction for the dark ending. Watch this movie. Once. Twice. Three times. Or simply read the Wikipedia summary and then watch the ending. For me, the rest of the movie could have been summarized in 10 minutes. But the ending, the discussion, the fact that it actually made sense on a deep philosophical point of view, is perfect. I wonder why this movie never got an Oscar. It deserved it. It's one of the deepest movie about human nature I ever seen, far deeper than Fight Club or Good Will Hunting.Please keep in mind that there are mature themes in this movie. While there is nothing especially graphical, no implicit nudity or violence, there is enough of both of them in a stylized manner. Add it to your library near ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" and keep in mind that it's not an easy watch.",Dogville
112,AppleBlossom,Another winner for Lans Von Trier,9,25 March 2005,"This could be a very strange film to some, considering it is filmed on a stage set and is improvised in some scenes. Please don't be deterred though, this is an exceptional piece of acting and storytelling. The director Lars Von Trier has somehow captured the brutal and sometimes ugly nature of people in a township named 'Dogville'. It could be any town (in real life) for that matter, the truth unfolding as the story is being told of an outsider needing help. As we (the viewer) examine the extent of human nature and the injustice we can bestow on a person, we realize it's not very far from the truth to our own everyday lives. Who know, we could stumble upon a situation just like this in the future? The story is very simple, but the undertones and morality are not. There is a lesson to be learnt by this film, indeed a very soul searching one at that. The portrayal of a township being tested on a daily basis (from the instant a stranger presents herself (Kidman)) for self worthiness to exist. How and why do we judge others??? .I interpreted the story basically from a good v evil perspective. The final chapter will certainly leave you wondering. 8.5/10 .highly recommended.",Dogville
113,fabiogaucho,Deconstructing America?,9,22 June 2008,"""Deconstructing"" the allegedly idealized American life in the suburbs and small towns is an old and recurring Hollywood idea. Blue Velvet, American Beauty, and Desperate Housewives are just a few examples of a subgenre of the larger ""indicting America"" motif. It specifically targets the lifestyle of most Americans, one that is most far from Hollywood people and most ""intellectuals"". In that subgenre, suburbia and rural areas dwellers (presumably Republican-voting) are shown as twisted, sexually perverted, women-hating and cruel hypocrites. There is nothing so outrageous you portray that will not gain appraisal as ""making one think about who we really are"". It actually makes people who already think one certain way happier about themselves. Dogville, directed by a Danish US-hater is more of a European highly stylized version of that subgenre than a look at the US from the Old World. Even the idea of making rape as a secret central feature of American lives is reminiscing of No Down Payment, the grandfather of the above mentioned movies. Still, there is something incredibly deeper about Lars Von Triers's take that makes Dogville, as well as some of his previous works, such as Dancer in the Dark and Breaking the Waves, more than a failed indictment: religious symbolism. It is the recurring pattern of putting a scapegoat of the collective sins and evils at the center of the story: the conversion of each inhabitant's aggression, in the form of physical violence or spite, towards a Christ-like figure  inevitably a woman. The scapegoat has always something different that makes it stand from the other citizens. In his previous movies, it can be just some strangeness of behavior, like the Bjork character in Dancer in the Dark. The scapegoat is not only rejected, it is the object of something like a religious sacrifice  it is collectively massacred. In Dogville, however, the Director goes one step further: Kidman's character arrival from outside the town is shown as the arrival of a strangely sacred figure, utterly pure and mysterious, whose treatment must determine how everyone who encounters her will be judged. If that is not enough to make you understand that she comes from heaven, the woman is called ""Grace"". The treatment is predictably harsh and thus so is the punishment. Heaven is not only the source of graces, but also of judgment. For some time the town's fate hangs in the balance, because the massacre is not absolutely unanimous  there is one righteous who will stand for angelic being. Once he turns on her, and becomes the priest who will use the knife upon the sacrificial victim, hell breaks loose and Dogville receives the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah. They didn't understand who she was. The anthropologist Rene Girard, in his investigations on the origin of society, said that every religion begins in the first sacrifice, when men stop fighting against each other and converge their violence into a scapegoat  possibly a person. The process is then repeated, and thus ritual sacrifice is born. Western religions, however, condemn the sacrifice, specially human, strongly, and thus the operation must go wrong.The problem of showing a modern society in such a ""state of nature"" is that, well, they already have a religion. It is hard to imagine a community exercising such treatment without some restraint from their moral commitment. Von Trier's answer, - and I wonder how many people have noticed that -, is removing the Church from the small community's life. In Dogville, there is a church building, but no pastor. In the end, this movie, like some of LVT previous, proves the exact opposite of the indictment on America: what it would be without its beliefs, and not what it is because of them.",Dogville
114,statman122,"A must see film, even if it is a bit too long",8,18 January 2021,"I agree with most of the positive reviews here. A film well worth watching, although I do think it could have been done in less than 3 hours.As for the religious whack jobs that see Caan and Kidman's characters as God and Jesus, ok sure. So your god is a ganster? Sounds about right given the manifestations of your moral convictions.I watched this because of Kidman, of whom I am a big fan. This might be the best piece of acting she has ever done.",Dogville
115,AndrewPhillips,powerful,8,21 April 2006,"I can understand that many people might find this a difficult film to watch let alone enjoy. After all there is no set to speak of, all the action takes place on a sound stage with markings on the floor depicting walls etc. It was this idea that appealed to me and prompted the purchase of the DVD (I missed it at the cinema, which was a shame).The lack of set means you focus on what really matters, the acting. Nicole Kidman is superb as Grace entering a town in the grips of the depression, perhaps this is why they react to her in the way they do, or is it more fundamental of human nature. Anyway she acts her socks off. The support cast also do a fine job, dear old Lauren Bacall, Paul Bettany, Patrica Clarkson etc.There are times when you find the going tough, especially the rape scene where because of the lack of walls on set not only do you see this horrible act but life going on around it, children playing, people shopping. It heightens our feelings of revulsion. I have to admit to a feeling of satisfaction at the end when she fails to save the town, after all she had been through I didn't blame her.",Dogville
116,binaryg,Dogville is Great!,10,22 May 2004,"Movies like Dogville don't come along very often. Some will say `Amen' to that. For me, Dogville is the reason I love film, and go to the show. Dogville is a work of the highest imagination and art. I could say there is great risk taking here but von Triers knows exactly what he wants and it is here to see and experience, love it or hate it. Many reviewers point out, some gloat, that von Tiers has never been to America. How can he know enough without having been here to make a film about America? 'People are the same all over, greedy as dogs' a character states.  This is about the human condition so it could be set anywhere. But coming as it does, at this time in our national history, it is indeed a comment and judgment on America and Americans. Is there anywhere in the world where people are not exposed to the culture that is America? We need to see how we are seen and experienced around the world.
Dogville is a film about hope and dreams and about smashed hopes and dreams. The acting is incredible especially Nicole Kidman's work. She is not afraid of risk. She makes the scene at the end with her father and the transformation involved completely believable. The rapes scenes carry such impact because of her ability show us how crushing such acts are. Here we can witness, in some small way, what mass media is hiding from us on a daily basis. Paul Bettany's Tom, the town philosopher, is a rich, complex character not easily understood but the more fascinating for that.
The actors have to compete with the set which seems odd given there's almost no set there. But presented with the minimalism of the town of Dogville I felt empowered by the director. The set exists as a kind of opposition to The Matrixes, The Lords of the Ring, and other films where the special effects provide the imagination for us. Here we're allowed to create along with von Triers. And finally yes, this is a pessimistic story. But have you noticed what going on in the world today?",Dogville
117,carljessieson,An Overwhelmingly Poignant Portrait of Humanity,9,6 September 2010,"Oh man. Dogville.Initially, I was completely confused. I thought it was some weird introduction, establishing some kind of idea that I needed to reflect upon throughout the film, but then what confused me stayed, and stayed, and stayed...and as the movie commenced, it didn't confuse me anymore. I got that it was a statement on the nature of small towns. I thought it was a really profound idea, and it only made me love the movie more. It was a huge risk by director Lars von Trier, but it really worked. He has my respect, for sure.The only thing I wasn't too fond of was the narration. Nope. Some old guy that's not even a character in the film? Just a random person? Yeah, I could have gone without that. I mean, it kinda helped establish the tone, the simple country living setting, but I still didn't like it. I would have gotten that tone anyway.The story was brilliant, unlike anything I have ever seen before. The movie had some slow pieces, but I didn't mind. It established the characters and the situation, and then the second half of the movie really, really picked up. von Trier used some really great techniques in shooting this film. I was incessantly impressed. It is truly a beautiful portrait of human nature. It's sad, it's delightful, it breeds hope, it satisfies the need for vengeance, it provokes thought.Ahh, what a beautiful film. I own this and I'm really happy that I do. I definitely recommend it. But keep in mind, this can definitely be described as ""unique"" or ""experimental filmmaking"". It took a bit to get used to it, but it's possible. Enjoy.",Dogville

120,hprill,Von Trier goes Brecht,9,26 November 2003,"(This makes more sense if you read it after having seen the movie.)From the alienation effect created by the bare theatrical setting and the odd voice-over to the didactic message, this movie has Bertolt Brecht written all over it, and just as Brecht does, Von Trier explores human nature and human exploitation from an odd analytic distance: his Dogville is no more in the USA than Brecht's Good Person of Szechwan is set in the real China or Saint Joan of the Stockyards in the real Chicago. Rather they are all just examples of universal characters that can be found in any place.Von Trier's moral inquiry goes one step further than Brecht (whose protagonists typically fail), when he provides a cathartic ending that somehow feels good even though it is totally inappropriate in moral terms; immediately before, two characters discuss the concept of arrogance, in which they apply it to totally opposite characters, and yet both are right. And even if it's true that the villagers' best was not enough, who is Grace to decide this? Once she is in a position of power, is she not just as bad as the villagers - or perhaps even worse?What is the story about anyway? Is it about a poor fugitive who is taken advantage of in the worst possible ways and who then takes bitter revenge, or is is about a group of poor villagers who are taking revenge on a rich girl, only to be beaten back into submission?And the pictures of poor American farmers from the 1930s juxtaposed with American homeless of the 1990s during the end credits - are they meant as criticism or excuse?If anything, the point that the philosopher character, who claims he can see through everybody, is the most clueless person in the film, should give you a clue that there are no answers in this movie, only questions, and as soon as you think you have an answer, you notice that you have been deceived.So who is arrogant - Grace, the gangster boss, the villagers, or you, the viewer?",Dogville
121,januaryman-1,Complex,7,26 November 2004,"I saw Dogville as a complex political allegory. I'm just not sure of the details; I'm still thinking about it. I think Ayn Rand could have written a hell of a review. There is self-hatred evident in the characters as well as hatred of anyone seen as more successful or more desirable than the residents of Dogville. Dogville is very abstract. What it means will likely depend on what filter the view applies to it on a particular viewing.My working interpretation is that the Dogvillites (Dogs?) represent collectivism while the mobsters represented fascism. The open sets, to me, represented the lack of privacy that destroys individualism while aiding collectivism. Kidman's character represented a new generation being asked to choose between collectivism and fascism when the two really aren't that far apart in their mechanisms.",Dogville

At first i wondered why it was done this way... in a dark studio with no walls or roofs. Even the plants are drawn... but the longer the movie drags(which arguably is the worst thing about the movie), the more it becomes clearer why it was done so. An all around good movie with some great performances and unique directing.

123,polar24,Shattering perception of society and human nature,8,24 January 2007,"In the beginning, there was Dogville. A peaceful town in the U.S, somewhere in the Rockies; the inhabitants living calmly and without the bothers of the outside world. By the end, the town and the people are shattered, each person baring their teeth, exposing their mortal flaws and getting retribution.Lars Von Trier's work is a curious exercise in film. Having seen many of his and his compatriots' films, I was astounded by what can be achieved when human emotions are laid raw on the table and portrayed so honestly and explicitly.Every Dogme film i've seen has exceptional heartbreaking performances and everyone here manages some of their best work. For some reason, the directing and sparseness all contribute to intense and powerful portrayalsThis is Von Trier's first time working with an all American cast and his pulls bravura performances out of every one of them including Nicole Kidman. Out of the highly talented cast Bettany's Edison is tender, perceptive, and charming. Bacall's (at 79!) Ma Ginger is leery, judicious, and astute. Gazzara, Clarkson, Skarsgård and Sevigny are all benevolent, sensitive, ferocious and unrelenting.The film uses sparse and coarse sets set up like a game of Cluedo where we can see all that is happening to the people at once. This sets up some interesting ironies throughout the film. In society, norms exists so that people treat each other with respect and kindness. But ""behind closed doors"". What we choose to disclose to people and how much of our lives are secret, to protect others or protect ourselves. One of the big mysteries of the film concerns Grace and what she did in her past life. She is given a rebirth in this town and the opportunity to make them better people, but can people be improved?The lack of superfluous direction ""tricks"" and visual effects only intensifies the performances and gives the characters nowhere to hide. Furthermore, you pay attention to what is most important in the film - what they are feeling and what they do about it.The film has been explicitly made about America and the end credits confirm this, but as I see it the qualities that the people develop could be occurring anywhere and for any civilisation. Betrayal, treachery, blackmail, sorrow. It is shocking that everyone one of us can be pushed to these limits given the opportunity. Seeing the dynamics of the characters within the film how they have changed by the climax was truly terrifying. It think it exposes human nature and the cause of wars, violence, racism and segregation in our evolution as communities.I saw it again last night after first watching it in the cinemas on it's original release. Once again I was entranced by these characters, taken in by their hospitality and the mysteries that exists behind the walls. The acting by everyone floored me and I was shattered by the end. you can If you watch the film with an open mind, there is a lot to think about and a lot of beauty in the storytelling and design. Take whatever meaning you want from it; the emotions are all there on display. This is a powerful self-reflective experience on society and definitely makes you think about what we are today.",Dogville
124,msultan,Homo homini canis,10,12 May 2004,"spoilersI've briefly skimmed through other reviews and most of them arebrandishing the 'anti-American' sword.  I watched Dogville lastnight (and I'm going again tomorrow) and I have to say that treatingit as anti-American is one long stretch!  This seems to reflectsparanoia more than anything else.  Although set in Depression- era USA, I don't think it was supposed to portray a typical Americantown in any way; it was rather supposed to trace the twists andturns (and ugliness) of human nature.I haven't seen many of Lars Von Trier's movies, but I have seen""Breaking the Waves,"" and I think that the two are very similar in theway they present a situation that turns around itself at one point todepict the exact opposite of what it has hitherto represented andstood for.  It was somewhat also very reminiscent of ShirleyJackson's short story, ""The Lottery,"" where a town organizes alottery once a year, where the winner gets stoned by the rest of thetown.With this perverse mood lurking in the background, ""Dogville"" is adisturbing movie, yet incredibly amazing. It should not be takenliterally.  I missed the first ten minutes, so I don't know if there wasan explanation given as to why the town is called Dogville, but itdoesn't take long to find out why that would be.  As the sayinggoes, homo homini lupus, or ""man is wolf to man,"" and this isexactly what Dogville (the movie and the town) is about.  In theconversation Grace has with her father at the end, they talk aboutacting within one's nature and how condemnable that is.  Up untilthen Grace is too graceful, but she finally gets it, and although thelast ten minutes are violent, it really is the best thing she's done inthe movie.So instead of being anti-American, this movie is rather anti-blind- Christian-charity. Grace (what a name!) takes everything in andforgives everyone, until she realizes that it's ridiculous to put upwith what one does not have to put up with, and that there is noreason for some people to get away with things by depending onothers' good christian sense.The setting was surreal. Despite it one still falls for the story anddisregards the fact that it's a set, that ""Elm Street has no elms,""and that even at the end of the movie it still felt weird when peopleopened and closed doors. The acting was excellent, thephotography sublime. Without reservation, I give this movie 10/10.",Dogville
125,benedictmichael-03235,From Dogmé to Dogville and back again,9,20 October 2021,"Dogville is a great film, almost. It is conceptually courageous in its use of an empty and stark soundstage. The ensemble cast is outstanding and the story harrowing and gripping.Alas, the film goes on for a tad too long and the whole episode with James Caan, and the revelation that Grace (Nicole Kidman) is a powerful mobster's daughter, for the final 10 to 20 minutes, irreparably damages the film. This final chapter (the film is divided into a prologue and nine chapters) seems to have been sewn on with post-mortem baseball stitches.Attempts to summarize the film's meaning, even by Trier himself - he said something to the effect that evil is everywhere - have been somewhat asinine. Trier, as is well known, plays to the Woke gallery, and his work since 'Dogville' has shown a steep decline.Dogmé was the rather foolish filmmaking movement started in 1995 by Danish directors Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg. They produced a Manifesto (Dogmé 95 Manifesto), as if it were the 1930s. It was rather Brechtian in its anti-escapism, and aspirations to dramatic purity. This is to be applauded surely. Its principles were, arguably, however, much like the principals themselves, bourgeois-reactionary.A closing remark. The adjective 'asinine' reminds us of Equus Asinus, the humble donkey. For 'Mandalay' (2005), a Trier film after 'Dogville,' while shooting on a sound stage, Trier apparently had a donkey slaughtered. The film's producer, Peter Aalbæk Jensen, insisted that the donkey was old and sick. Make of that what you will, but cruelty to animals is morally depraved and vicious.Dogville is a great film, almost. Trier is not a good person, certainly.",Dogville

It must have been intentional to present this with an uninteresting script, childish dialog, and mostly flat performances (the empty sets was obviously intentional).

129,willwoodmill,"A beautiful, touching study of community and morals",10,8 February 2016,"Lars Von Trier is one of my favorite directors of all time, so I went into this film expecting to like it, but I was not expecting this film to be (arguably) his best. Like all of his other films, Dogville was very dividing among critics and audiences (even though it is one of his better received). Some praised it for being groundbreaking and innovative with its minimalist approach to set design, and deeply emotional and moving with its incredibly human characters, while others criticized it for being tedious, melodramatic, pessimistic, and of course the classic Von Trier criticism, pretentious. That word gets thrown around a lot, pretentious, and rarely do people even know what it means, it means adding greater meaning or importance to something then is actually possessed. And believe me Dogville never tries to be more important than it actually is. But what is Dogville about? Well if you somehow didn't already know and are reading this review I'll give a brief summary, Dogville is about a very small town up in the Rocky Mountains, that doesn't receive any visitors and is essentially shut off from the rest of the world (minus a radio and a telephone). In this small town a strange girl appears one night seeking shelter from some strange men that are after her, after the town reluctantly accepts her, she pays them back by doing small things around town that, as the film says, don't really need to be done. The film then explores the nature of how a community functions, moral convictions, Justice, and punishment. As the heroine tries to live her life in the small town of Dogville. Nicole Kidman plays the heroine, Grace Margaret Mulligan, with a performance that is able to rival björk in dancer in the dark, or Emily Watson in breaking the Waves. But she is not the only great performance in the film, all of the supporting roles, even minor characters are noteworthy, and it is basically impossible to talk about Dogville and not talk about the set design, I hinted at it earlier, but the really is nothing like it. There is only one set in the whole film and that is the town and that is just a big empty space with chalk borders drawn on the floor and a few props her and there, of course in the reality of the film it is a real town, but to us the audience we see everything wide open we are entering their small world, just like Nicole Kidman.9.3/10",Dogville
130,filmchasing,Viewer's Beware......,6,21 February 2010,"I loved the trailer, okay. So, anyone who appreciates that, along with a good story, will undoubtedly find *something* to like in Dogville... but for myself, and after a rather misleading idea of it actually being a 'typical' film, meaning good cinematography, locations, sets, etc. and not seeing that right off, without any type of warning... well, I lasted 3 minutes before I wanted to quit.However, I stuck with it after skimming the reviews, and I'm sort of glad I did.This is my tip to surviving this movie: fast-forward the heck out of it.Honestly, all the parts that looked boring or when I knew there was unnecessary narration or patterns that I didn't feel like watching in regards to character interactions, I just fast-forwarded it. Even if I might have missed some stuff, I inevitably saved an hour out of the 3, and I still got to enjoy the overall story. The performances at the end, after I had gotten the gist of the first half, were really moving, especially Nicole Kidman's. I really enjoyed the cyclical aspect of the narrative, and once I understood what was happening, the lack of set design didn't bother me too much (although I think it'd be that much better if it was on-location).Anyway, it's worth watching if you want to try something a little different. It certainly has a theater-feel to it, but the performances make the film, and the themes can be looked at on a deeper level, so to the skeptics: I wouldn't overlook it entirely. Not my favorite film in the world, but interesting nevertheless.6.5/10",Dogville
131,highkite,A great movie to watch just once in your life,8,23 July 2006,"""Dogville"" is a movie that some may call a play. It's set on a large production stage, the houses are marked with chalk, and there are close to no props. However, the movie works in a couple of ways. Director Lars von Trier prepares us for this theater-based movie by placing a heading before anything starts. It states that what we are about to see is a prologue and that we are about to get introduced to the characters. Then a narrator comes on and we are shown the whole 'city' of Dogville. This narration is simple yet highly descriptive, and helps the audience participate in much of the visual aspect of the movie.The setting seems isolated and withdrawn from any major city life. The townspeople all have different jobs and they all seem to participate and communicate only amongst each other. They are the only source of energy in the whole town. Nothing other than the characters is real, and nothing at first seems out of the ordinary. This is a very original idea in that movies like this only work if you have the right script. Luckily, Lars von Trier wrote the perfect script for a movie like this.We are first introduced to the key character, Tom Edison (Paul Bettany), a writer who's having trouble writing his latest novel. The rest of the cast is almost clueless to anything but their own, repetitive life. During one night, Tom sits outside as a beautiful woman wonders through their town. She hides behind a mountain and Tom offers to keep her safe, as she is followed by gangsters. She introduces herself as Grace (Nicole Kidman) and immediately there's a sense of chemistry between the two. The rest of the townspeople seem incredulous and oblivious to Grace's appearance, and all want her to prove herself trustworthy of staying in their town. To do so, Grace goes door to door asking everyone if they need help with their chores. At first they seem reluctant, but soon rely only on her to take care of their work for them.The movie runs for almost 3 hours and for a good reason. There is a definite establishment of character from each person in this movie, and a high drive for all of their actions. It's a way of presenting a society that's been isolated their whole life. We meet Chuck (Stellan Skarsgård) who also came to Dogville from a different town. At first he resents Grace but later uses her for more than just work. As each person in the town blames Grace for no reason other than that she hasn't lived there all her life, Grace falls victim to rape, imprisonment and slavery. All of this presents a very powerful idea about an isolated society during the great depression.The aspect that sticks out about the movie is definitely the acting. Nicole Kidman's risky performance is brilliant as she subtly yet flowingly portrays a confused young woman who's falling apart from her past and from her present. She beautifully steals the spotlight (no pun intended) as the gorgeous hard-working stranger that everyone uses for their own sick pleasure.Often portrayed as an anti-American with his false portrayal of the society, Lars von Trier creates something so original and unique, that it almost dares not enter mainstream.",Dogville

(Spoilers, maybe) Despite a deeply empathetic performance from Nicole Kidman, I had no idea what von Trier was after. He brutalizes an actress, exposes the duplicitous, greedy underbelly of a town of small-minded inbreds (that not-so-clearly symbolizes 'Capitalism Run Amok = Slavery!'), then condemns his entire universe of characters  those who survive, anyway  to a future of amoral hopelessness.His version of America? Who cares. All of this is surrounded by John Hurt's extraneous, should-have-been-deleted narration, which again and again tells us 'what's really happening' but never 'really' does. Other distancing (Brechtian) techniques abound: i.e., a marvelous town 'setting' which forces the audience to imagine time and space, yet the set is poorly, monotonously photographed, and ends up meaning nothing: we would have concentrated on these actors' faces regardless of the abstraction surrounding them. Re: the camera work: The famous 'Kubrick pullback' is used again and again, yet no von Trier pullback reveals any hidden truth or meaning at any given moment. So. von Trier is no Bertholt Brecht and certainly no Stanley Kubrick, but neither is he Friedrich Dürrenmat, whose plot of 'The Visit' Dogville is clearly lifted from. But there's no harm in derivation if cleverly done. Unfortunately, von Trier mires himself and us in murky political euro-symbolism that fails to illuminate his plot. There's a nifty revenge twist at the end, but it seems to have nothing to do with what's come before. Dogville may be disturbing and memorable, but it's a sophomoric effort at best. I'll watch von Trier in the future, but he's never been better than 'Zentropa (Europa)'  and that was a long time ago. 4/10",Dogville

Well, I don't normally like those talky films that get critical acclaim and offer agonizingly slow story development, but once this gets going, it's fascinating.Much has been said of the film's anti-Americanism, or more particularly, how this is an indictment of modern, fascist Amerika. I guess if you read Moby Dick and believed all the college professor's blather about how the St. Elmo's Fire was a homoerotic orgasm, you'll buy into that anti-American schtick for this movie. Personally, I don't see it. Dogville is some little, isolated Colorado town in the midst of the Depression; it could as easily have been any scared little town trying to maintain its existence in a harsh world doing existential battle against it. We've seen lots of scared little towns like this, with scared little people, on The Twilight Zone. It's a flaw of the human condition, not America.The film is somewhat derivative of some of the intellectual conceits in others, particularly ""Rashomon"", ""Woman in the Dunes"" and, explicitly at the end, ""The Visit.""

Good on her.Trouble is, when she says it about a movie like this (Dogville) you just realise how dumb she is. Dogville is tremendous. Powerful, clever and brutal. No doubt my check-out chick had never seen a play or heard of Albee, Pinter etc. Short story is that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Sure, it's slow, has no set to speak of and has far too much voice-over narrative (no doubt in a vain effort to entertain the poor Jane's of the world). It makes up for that in the raw emotion it shows.Don't be swayed. This is a story about one thing and one thing only. It's about how naive immigrants/visitors to a new country inevitably get screwed by their new community. It's a beautiful cometary on how new arrivals try hard only to get rammed by the society they arrive in. This ISN'T just anti American as many (too many) commentators have said. It's the same in Australia (where I live) and Britain, Spain, France - anywhere where refugees go.The point is, human nature is the same everywhere. Osama Bin Laden are you listening?

I don't know when I've seen a film that has 'wierded' me out as much as this one. It's absolutely tremendous.

The set is chalk lines drawn on the floor, and at first you may view this as the emperor clearly parading naked; that this is dogma inspired artistic film flam. But quickly the purpose is revealed; this is a town whose walls are self imposed, where the opaque is made transparent because of collective apathy.

But it was a good film despite my partner and I wishing to crush the life out of all the players... The ending as it was became an inevitability. Both to satisfy us as viewers that had suffered along with the girl and also to make the point - a point that might have arguably been made just as succinctly in a 60-80min movie...A bit less NYPD blue camera work would have been appreciated - shaking a camera doesn't fool the audience into thinking you had more than one rolling on any given take and can be REALLY annoying. But there was also some very nice camera work and a similar film done ina more conventional means on location would have been dazling.Great cast, I guess filming in a tight timeframe, in a studio and giving the cast one outfit to wear throughout you can splurge on casting. It paid off in my opinion... and what a treat to see who turns up! I couldn't help but liken my experience seeing this to sitting through Angelas' Ashes.

141,Arconada,"Good movie, choppy story line",7,17 October 2006,"I will not write a long review about the movie - a lengthy movie deserves a short review. I just watched Dogville on DVD with friends. The fact that we watched it from the beginning to the end without any 'witty' comments shows that we all appreciated the very good acting. It is really excellent. Other reviewers have written in detail about most of the aspects of this movie, so I will not repeat that. The only thing that I want to say here is that the story line shows some annoying breaches. To me it is clear that Grace offers to do odd jobs for the community. But it is not at all clear to me why the people of this town suddenly want her to do twice as much for half the money, after the ""Wanted"" poster was nailed to the wall. The story suddenly heads in a direction that can not be explained out of the previous behaviour of the people. The same thing happens again when Grace tries to escape. Why was she brought back, anyway? Why does everyone, and I mean everyone, start to take advantage of her? And why does nobody object to that? It's inexplicable. The third breach is in the finale. To prevent spoilers I will not go into detail, but everyone who saw the movie knows what I am talking about. Why does she do that? And why does she without any regret in the end take the side of the man who was the reason for her to flee to Dogville? The change of behaviour is too abrupt; the story did not convince me that these were inevitable, natural changes. It makes the flow of the story line choppy. To bad, because the actors deserved better.",Dogville
142,bjhadse,Proof That There is a Reason for Traditional Aesthetics.,4,2 October 2011,"Grace Mulligan (Nicole Kidman) is on the run from the mob in the Rocky Mountains. When she stumbles upon the tiny village of Dogville, a town of fifteen, she seeks refuge among its citizens. The town, however, is skeptical of harboring a stranger. In an attempt to win them over, she visits with each citizen every day and does whatever chores they have for her. This campaign succeeds and she is accepted by the people of Dogville. When the police start looking her, however, and wanted posters start showing up, the secret of Grace's presence weighs heavily on the townspeople, who begin to lash out at her.""Dogville"" is an obviously experimental film, radically abandoning tradition Western film aesthetics in favor of minimalistic, theatrical ones. The film is shot entirely on a bare sound stage. Instead of physical buildings or landscapes (trees, bushes, etc...), everything is chalked out and labelled on the ground like a to-scale architect's blueprint. The four walls of the sound stage are stark white during day scenes and muted black during night scenes. There is no non-diegetic sound (such as background music), save for the fact that the film is narrated by voice-over (John Hurt). Furthermore, the film features jarringly non-traditional editing, in which cuts are unexpectedly rapid and characters - without any indication - have changed location between shots (such as a sitting character unexpectedly moving to a standing position since the last shot they were in).I will admit that I am in the critical minority when it comes to ""Dogville."" Despite a solid story, capable acting (particularly from Nicole Kidman, Stellan Skarsgard and Paul Bettany) and a few brilliant moments (particularly when Grace is raped by Chuck behind closed doors, which in Dogville is in plain sight of the entire town), the film is ultimately a failure. The total abandonment of traditional, Western film aesthetics, while an interesting directorial decision, was ultimately damaging to the film's overall presentation. In fact, many of those consciously neglected aesthetics (realistic sets, realistic lighting, realistic landscape, non-diegetic music, smooth Hollywood-esque editing) would have greatly amplified the film's quality. The lighting, in particular, did little more than hurt my eyes from constant exposure to it over the course of the film.""Dogville"" is not nearly as interesting as the inevitable discussions that it will spawn. Fans of non-traditional cinema (which is to say non-mainstream cinema) will love this film. Film students should see this film for its radical departures from traditional aesthetics. Other than that, however, I fail to see this film garnering a large or even moderately-sized following.",Dogville
143,K-nightt,Lines in the sand,8,24 May 2011,"This film transposes the concept of ignored transparency beautifully. It is something we all engage in, rather egregiously, yet it is difficult to see if portrayed so vividly. There is indeed destruction behind beauty, and despite conscious efforts and wishes to see something modified into a supposedly ""better"" condition, it becomes clear that the unconscious desire will ultimately wreak havoc, especially when aided by a dysfunctional and envious mass mentality. Unintegration prevailed, and when a unifying force showed up in Dogville, one that could make the town actually unite in something positive (the admiration and appreciation of Grace's presence), the threat of disintegration ensued, and she needed to be destroyed and incorporated into the unintegrated structure. There truly are no walls to hold us in, we are all very knowing and aware of what goes on in the minds and bodies of our fellow man, and truly the structures we edify are illusory and used as defense mechanisms so as to not have to identify with the perverse nature of others we see in ourselves. This movie begets the question alluded to at the end, which I interpreted as ""is this town real?"" (reinforced by the drawing of the dog becoming real at that moment), and truly it is, real in every individual psychic microcosm as an intolerable reality; one may even sympathize with the murderous mobsters at the end wiping out the hapless people.

144,Latheman-9,Surprisingly good.,7,3 August 2004,"With ""Dogville,"" Lars von Trier treats viewers to yet another tale of an angelic innocent degraded, despoiled, and otherwise victimized by those around her and the circumstances in which she is placed, although in this case the innocent ends up having teeth.  With the earlier, similar works ""Breaking the Waves"" (1996) and ""Dancer in the Dark"" (2000), and to a lesser extent ""The Idiots"" (1998), one can only hope that this is the final chapter in this theme with which von Trier appears to be obsessed.  Frankly, it has become tiresome.Perhaps dissatisfied with the vagaries that can arise from his self-imposed Dogme 95 rules when shooting outdoors, von Trier enters a Brechtian phase with ""Dogville,"" choosing to shoot it as a play with minimalist sets.  To some extent, they remind me of the similarly simple yet evocative sets the Japanese/Irish-American artist Isamu Noguchi made for the dancer Martha Graham who was active during the time period of this film, the 1930s.  And I think this was a wise choice, certainly as it helps minimize the technical gaffs that are part and parcel of von Trier's Dogme years, although there are still more than a few here: the editing is sloppy (unless von Trier believes that jump-cutting is still artsy cool) and continuity errors abound.  However, these are small complaints about an otherwise well-crafted work.  The large ensemble cast performs well for the most part.  I found the performances of Ben Gazzara and Stellan Skarsgard particularly notable, and somehow von Trier was able to make the always-annoying Jeremy Davies refrain from his ubiquitous twitches and idiosyncratic hand movements.  Now _that's_ directorial genius.  John Hurt's voice-over narration was also spot on.  I did not find the length of the film burdensome; I never lost interest in the story as it progressed.  Most of all, I was surprised to find that I wasn't put off by the film as I have been with most of von Trier's works.From a political standpoint, I didn't find ""Dogville"" to be particularly anti-American as some have claimed, certainly no more so than Sam Peckinpah's ""Straw Dogs"" (1971) can be said to be anti-English, or Guy de Maupassant's depiction in some of his stories of some particularly loathsome rural villagers can be said to be anti-French.  I think the theme of small-minded cruelty arising from ignorant parochialism can be considered universal.  As for the sequence of still photographs of dire poverty flashed during the closing credits, with David Bowie singing ""Young Americans"" in the background, many of those shots (perhaps most of them) were taken during the Great Depression during which the film is set, and the Depression affected the entire world.  And if, for the sake of argument, it was von Trier's intention to be 'anti-American,' then he has impaled himself on his own sword.  At the end of the film, who sits in final judgment of the residents of Dogville?  Those with the guns; i.e., those with the military power.  If the USA is indeed the world's sole superpower, is von Trier then saying that it has the right to sit in judgment of the rest of the world?  I should hope not!  Nonetheless, I can see how America with its element of social Darwinism might seem a scary place to anyone born into, reared in, and (as far as I know) continues to live in a cradle-to-grave welfare state as is the case with von Trier, particularly since he has never lived in nor even visited the USA.  But consider the following thought experiment: if one were to visit the capital of each of the world's nations, which embassy would most likely have the greatest number of applicants for visas to move to that embassy's country?  Here's a hint -- it wouldn't be Denmark's. Rating: 7/10.",Dogville
145,ProfessorFate,"On the wrong side of the tracks from ""Our Town"" lies ""Dogville""",9,4 May 2014,"Lars von Trier takes the luscious fruit of ""the American Dream"", peels off the pretty facade, and reveals the ugliness, vanity, and judgment underneath. Yes, Dogville could be any town in the world, but it fits 21st century USA too well to ignore the connection.The early theme of the film is, ""You people need to be more accepting,"" which flies in the face of American self-sufficiency. We can make it alone through hard work and faith in God. We don't need anything from ""outsiders"".When Tom introduces Grace and tells the denizens of Dogville that she will provide them with a chance to display their generosity and compassion, they are extremely skeptical. One of the delights of this film is watching that seed of skepticism evolve, first into a small plant of teamwork and trust, then later into a huge, monstrous tree of hate and intolerance.There are many ways to analyze this film, but what first came to me was that it was an allegory of America's disdain for welfare. Grace must offer herself to the community and do little jobs for them in return for shelter. At first they must create work for her (she can do ""things you don't want done""), but slowly the citizens expectations and demands increase, and they lord their power over her with threats and insults, much the same way many Americans act towards poor people who are on welfare (""They're lazy, they should get a job, they're not one of us.""). Eventually Grace becomes literally ""chained"" to the community, a slave and criminal. Finally the citizens just want Tom to get rid of her, so similar to how much of America would like to have their poor and homeless problem just go away.Another theme constantly repeated throughout the film is the theme of ""arrogance"". Grace mentions more than once the sin of arrogance, and it is most certainly that which brings about the violent conclusion of Dogville. America and arrogance? I'll let the readers decide the legitimacy of that connection.""Dogville"" is also about the presence of evil in all human beings. People appear decent on the surface, but given the right mixture of circumstances and motivations we are all capable of terrible acts. Following said acts we are also capable of rationalizing our behavior and deluding ourselves into believing we acted morally, perhaps even heroically. Patriots commit atrocities for their flag. True believers do likewise for their God.Bravo to the brilliant Mr. von Trier for exposing the dark underbelly of the American Dream in such a pointed and creative way.",Dogville
146,vivesi-1,von Trier strikes again,10,31 August 2004,"There will probably be spoilers within. Whatever one can say about DOGVILLE, one can't say that's it's not provocative. People feel passionate about this film, one way or another, like most of von Trier's creations, and in this world of increasing apathy and passionless commercial art, that's no small feat. I happen to be an admirer of the von Trier's works and found DOGVILLE to be no exception. The 3 hours flew by for me as I was attempting to untangle his allegory and metaphors in every scene, and here's the most amazing part: I already knew the story, how it ended, and many of the details. I agree with a former film instructor, that viewers often get far too caught in what happens in a story-almost in a childlike way (imagine children telling a ghost story)-while ignoring altogether the most meaningful aspects of a film. In DOGVILLE, of course, those aspects are the allegory itself, the many references to Americana, and reflections on human nature itself.To all that vehemently argue that DOGVILLE is a critique of the US and to those who argue the opposite: I think you're both right. There are too many (wonderfully rendered) references to the myth of being American for it not to be, on one level, a scathing critique of both American culture and American cinema and TV: the obvious relationship to OUR TOWN, the American movie device of using the folksy narrator to tell a heartwarming story about how goshdarn good Americans really are, apples (Johnny Appleseed, American as apple pie), the Mafia running the show, the pointedly simplistic use of language and the initial representation of small town values found only in TV shows like ANDY GRIFFITH, LEAVE IT TO BEAVER, etc. If our TV shows and movies are us telling ourselves who we are, then I think von Trier has ample source material to attack with a vengeance. He also makes pointed references to America's Puritan past, and the inherent hypocrisy of taping on `Christian' intentions to purely self-serving motivations. Even though the town has lost its minister and doesn't go to church, Puritan ethics-be good to others, work hard, etc--still structure the town members' thinking. No ethics command their actions, however; hence the hypocrisy that always existed in a country established by Puritans--be good to others unless they're Native American, Chinese, black, anything other than Euro white. Work hard unless you can get someone else to do it, preferably slaves, but at least as cheaply as possible. Grace arrives; she is different, and she will be punished for being different and exploited because she's the minority. von Trier is making a big point here: her name is Grace-Tom prayed for a gift-there are several references to her beauty, both inner and outer. She is the best human being among them, a martyr for her belief that people deserve forgiveness. Providence provided Dogville `grace' and they spat in its face. All that said, of course one can easily extrapolate to include all human beings in this critique, but I believe von Trier's argument is that Americans are, thus far, the most willfully blind about our cruelties, and stupidly broadcast ourselves the most widely as saints. (Much of our TV and movie screen time is telling each other how great we are.) We are the best examples of some of the worst behaviors that human beings can exhibit. There are many, many examples of these behaviors in other societies but no one country regularly (perhaps daily) celebrates itself like the US does, to my knowledge. Now, name some recent movies written and directed by Americans that are this provocative (hell, just this creative). `Dearth' is the word you need. I also think it's interesting how many Americans posted on IMDB how much they admire this film. Maybe there's hope.",Dogville

Although I have to say that the story is all the more interesting given the revelation of the American treatment of Iraqi prisoners. Perhaps it's America's current state of fear, paranoia and isolation from the rest of the world that brings on the accusations of anti-Americanism but I don't buy it.

It brings the story to the bone, and bares the bones of the most human behaviors.  There are few props and less set pieces to assist the actors.

I personally didn't find it boring (quite the reverse) or pretentious. I was fascinated!Overall it can be seen to be a sad film. However, maybe it's all too realistic and therefore that feels uncomfortable. Would people really react like that-taking advantage of another human being knowing they could get away with anything? I don't think it takes much for people's shadow to emerge. After all look what happens when there's a riot? Aren't there looters? What is that but downright theft of others' property.This film has left a mark beyond its hours.

""Station Agent"", for example.  But ""Dogville"" is something peculiarly disconnected from the viewer.  Rather than wanting to win the viewer over, this film places you in ""Dogville"", a member of the community - for a time. Then suddenly, before you have time to ""figure it out"", you are ripped out of the community...you are part of the death of the community.  Are these the only choices we have?  Is all of life merely about the wielding of power?  Killer or victim? And how can such a bleak vision, so abstract, so god-awful, be so uplifting, so intoxicating?

Isn't it strange that this movie was rated highest in the demographics that are of most interest to people that fund these movies? However, I have yet to meet a SINGLE 'average' person who liked this movie. And I worked in a video store. In fact, the demographic I found most likely to dislike this movie...was 18-29 year-olds. And my 15-year-old son and his friends laughed when I tried to put this on. I did tell them that it was highly recommended by others in their age group. I believe the group consensus was 'No way.

I think the point of this movie was supposed to be to show off the acting talents of fairly big-name actors. What I don't get is...why would anyone except casting directors watch it? Its a 'movie pretending to be in a theatre', without anything but a blank warehouse for a set, and lines drawn with tape on the floor. I thought movies were supposed to be a visual medium? Heck, there is even written text telling you what is supposedly the point of the scene. So, the producer thinks the audience won't get it?

153,FilmLiquet,Film Liquet on Dogville,5,7 November 2018,"Much like ""The Lobster"", ""Dogville"" does not hide or cut away from anything, it shows it how it is. Revealing the true, dark nature of a seemingly innocent little town called Dogville, the film shows how Grace (Nicole Kidman), runs away from gangsters and seeks refuge in a town, which offers a safe place for Grace, as long as she works hard under the townspeople. The two-faced town is shown via a soundstage, almost like a theatre set with a minimalistic design, to show that it is not hiding anything, other than the wretched people that live there. The film feels as though it is a piece of English literature - narrated throughout and divided into chapters, which tell the audience what is going to happen subsequently.Shot on a soundstage and looking like a theatre set, the film captures the attention of the audience and keeps it on the characters, making us endure all the character changes and interactions throughout. Instead of being distracted by massive sets and gorgeous cinematography, the film makes us focus entirely on the performance, highlighting even the subtlest details in performance. Thus, the terrific performance from Kidman and Bettany is what captures the attention whilst watching the film, as the vulnerable woman is made to suffer.Dogville is not intended for everyone. Many critics acclaimed it to be pretentious, exasperating even. However, putting all the conflicting emotions aside and analysing it as a film piece it simply works. It tells a story through the picture and gets emotions out of the audience. It fully succeeds its duty to be a film, no matter the cost.",Dogville
154,cinemaofdreams,"An Audacious, Brilliant Work of Art",10,8 May 2004,"Dogville is one of the most satisfying pieces of cinema I have seen. It is not for all tastes, but a triumph for the more literate crowd. Some may see it as anti-American. In reality, it is an astonishing examination of human nature with all its fickleness and blemishes brilliantly (and unnervingly) exposed. It could be called the ""Anti-Our Town"". The length of the film was not an issue with such incredible story telling. The set's minimalism is perfect and enhances the acting. The film is always conscious of being a story, and the narration only adds to its literary dimensions. The cast is stellar and Nicole Kidman's performance is both subtle and devastating. What an experience! 10/10.",Dogville
155,kos-27,a groundbreaking truth,10,1 March 2009,"Since this movie is rated under 8 - which is a shame - I decided to write a comment and to rate it.  I would like to give it more than a 10 because it's a true work of art.   Outstanding art changes a viewers perception and leaves a lasting impression on him because it tells an absolute truth. This movie is such a truth.   It is a work without compromises and with a clear vision what it should look like. The stage-like  minimalism is a means of purifying our senses and getting the message across as clear and as strong as light.   It's a film about our society, be it America or any western civilization of today. Americans shouldn't be offended by it because it¹s the truth.   It's about the mechanism of power. The powerful exploit the weak. That¹s how society works: First it's nature, then it's the animals, then it's the slaves, then it's entire nations.   The easier it is to manipulate a person the more we take advantage of her ­because we can. The weak and the kind hearted are the first to go under -like Grace. There is no sense of justice or moderation in our behavior - as long as we can easily get what we want. It's a creeping process we're not even aware of.Primitive people do it with violence (wars are the most direct way of showing power). Clever people do it in a more subtle way. The most dangerous are the ones who manipulate you seemingly unintentional - like Tom. He seems likable at first but at the end he's the worst of all.This is a masterpiece in showing how we slip into bondage (either as the oppressor or the oppressed) without realizing it. In the end there is no easy way out other than destruction and death. I hope this movie didn't describe the end of our world!It¹s a movie with biblical proportions, it¹s a so called big, important movie, a true masterpiece.",Dogville
156,WilliamOTyler,Simple but Effective,8,6 January 2016,"Dogville depicts the happenings of a humble little American town, of the same name, when a troubled newcomer stumbles into town and begins to stir its residents out of their comfort zone. It is the first movie in director Lars Von Trier's USA: Land of Opportunities series that follows a woman named Grace, portrayed here by Nicole Kidman, as she moves through America experiencing its history and culture. Here, she has somewhat of a backwards Cinderella story as Von Trier strips the idea of a small American town down to its bare essentials.The entire film takes place in a black box on a sound stage where the buildings and locations of the town are outlined in chalk on the floor, like a life size map with minimal props around to sell the idea that this is where these citizens live. It's strange for a fully fledged film, but it doesn't take long to get used to, as the story and characters are enticing enough to fill in the gaps for a suspension of belief. Before long, you won't even notice that walls don't hide anything from anyone and the mine at the edge of town isn't just a series of wooden arches.With a background that is mostly black, the cinematography is pretty limited to a few interesting lighting effects and pulling focus to the actors at hand. It seems that it would be very fun and freeing for an actor to be able to work with an ensemble cast on a project like this. The ensemble is so filled with great actors that there are too many to name them all, but the chemistry among them is smooth, fitting them together like pieces of a complete puzzle. They all get their moments to shine within the stories that intertwine these households together.Dogville is somehow a convincing combination of several mediums, film, the stage and prose, that could have gone horribly wrong. All three of these mediums have different ways of telling the same story that need to be taken into account when adapting from one to the other, but here, they all work separately and simultaneously together without becoming a jumbled mess. This is like a filmed production of a stage show playing out the actions read from a novel, with John Hurts as the voice of God narrating the actions, thoughts, backgrounds and feelings of all of the characters, which sounds a bit much but actually ends up being simple and lovely.Though it does still tread that balance of realism and fantasy, this is very different for a film from Lars Von Trier. It is much less involved and simple, in a way, but that lends itself to how Von Trier may be perceiving America, a place the director hasn't really experienced first hand, and it's people who have long been critically harsh and at odds with him. Even still, Dogville manages to be yet another bitter and thought provoking look at life and the struggles we experience.",Dogville
157,Good-Evening-Clarice,Nicole Kidman is officially the next Meryl Streep,10,25 May 2003,"After her astonishing turns in EYES WIDE SHUT, MOULIN ROUGE, THE OTHERS, and THE HOURS, Nicole Kidman held promise as the next Meryl Streep. But following her unforgivable performance in DOGVILLE, she more than earns the title. One of the most striking and memorable films you will ever see (and the lack of sets actually helps), this violent, shocking film is a must for all film fans. I cannot wait to see Kidman in COLD MOUNTAIN!",Dogville
158,aaronclawrence,Nice stage show. Should make a movie,6,18 February 2006,"There's no doubt about it, Mr von Trier is clever, and can write a story. The story is quite interesting, although loses its way a little at some points, and at other points the trauma heaped on the protagonist is just too over the top.However, this movie smacks of clever dickiness; of being clever just for the sake of it. Realistically, this is not a movie; a rational description is a stage show that happens to have been filmed. That's fine; but mentally masturbating about this as some kind of inspiration is not necessary. It's simply a choice that most people wouldn't bother exploring, because it's fairly obvious that it's not going to be very useful. Interesting? Yes (somewhat). Clever? Yes. Great? Not especially.",Dogville

The story is straightforward to follow, quite gripping, and has a very satisfying twist at the end - which I don't think anyone on these pages has given away.The chalk-line set is not just a gimmick, but justified by the storyline, which is all about seeing people as they really are.  A kind of Lord of the Flies.Nicole Kidman is brilliant as usual - though looking painfully thin - and it was nice to see James Caan again.  John Hurt's voiceover is detailed and helpful. It's a shame that, at least in the UK, the film has been given such a limited release that few will make the effort to see it - an effort that would be well repaid.",Dogville
160,headtrauma420,Complete and utter TRASH!,2,19 November 2004,"I just don't understand how this movie got such good reviews. It's boring, pretentious, monotonous, and vomitous! The minimalist set didn't work for OUR TOWN, what made them think it would work for this movie. It seemed more like a cop-out than a brilliant idea.I understand that the characters are a commentary on the two-faced nature of people. Even though that is the purpose of the characters, they didn't stir up enough emotion in me for me to care about any of them...A poor attempt at nihilism, maybe?To top it all off, this movie is far too long and has a half-assed predictable ending. Ten minutes would have been too long for this movie, let alone three hours. While watching this film, I drank a lot of wine, in hopes that it would improve my interest in the film. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy!",Dogville
161,myungjahigh,sincere and honest toward mankind,9,20 March 2012,"Two years ago, after watching The Idiots of Lars Von Trier, I promised myself that I'm not going to watch his other movies ever again. I could hardly watch The Idiots because of its cruelty which is not simply from blood or slash stuff. I was distressed mentally over the film. However, two years later, I came to watch Dogville, (I broke my promise..) and became to love Lars Von Trier.Dogville is also very hard and harsh to watch as I imagined. very inhumane. At the very beginning of the movie, I thought it is silly of the movie due to its background settings. Everything is set up as if I am watching a play. Audiences can see everything obviously through the emptiness. There's no blocked, structured buildings, but only chalk lines explain here is a house. I felt like I am walking through a barren woods where twiggy trees have no leaves. I wondered what could happen at this place in which every single step and breath is shown transparently. The settings even seemed cute to me. However, after Dogville started, I mean, from the start to the end, I became speechless about the genius director and brilliant set which is highly important to carry out the movie's theme. Sound effects or realistic location is unnecessary when it comes to Dogville. What Dogville wants to show is 'human beings' themselves, not other things. It is hard to focus on people in the jungle with abundant leaves and trees. But, it would be much easier among naked trees. I got attracted to the director's brightness and originality even from a set.Dogville concentrated on human kinds, and reveals them. Grace sneak about Dogville with a secret, and Tom, who calls himself a philosopher but actually got only hypocrisy, decided to make Grace as a good illustration for his theory. From the first, Tom considered her as his 'tool' in order to realize his ideal and empty thought. He only thinks that Grace is a kind of material to make him different from others. Other villagers, at first, did not care much about her. Grace started to help them with thinking that they will open their mind to her someday. And bit by bit, the dwellers got to realize that she is helpful, and they let her live in the village. The people of Dogville did take her not because of humanity nor morality. Every person in the town saw a convenient tool in Grace. When the wanted paper of Grace was attached in Dogville, people found that they got higher positions and more powers than Grace. The village people became to treat her as if she is a slave, and they showed their ugly aspects as it is. Tom kept saying that he will save her from the village, but what he said was nothing but a wordy show. The only person called an intellectual in Dogville couldn't take an action, and he just put Grace into more terrible situations. For Tom, Grace was a practical example that he is actually a hypocrite same as others.Grace believed that forgiveness and goodness can change the world in a different way, not like a gangsters' society based on power and fights. Still, the harder she tried to help and forgive people, the more they showed their hideous desires and selfishness. She finally realized that it was very arrogant to say that she would be superior to others if she sacrifices. Therefore, she punished Dogville. killed everyone, burned it. She especially killed Tom by herself. He was too arrogant to let him killed by other hands. And, the dog Moses survived, who is the most superior creature in Dogville. (Isn't it very meaningful?)The movie Dogville describes ugly and passive nature of human so well. Human is not the one who 'thinks' and 'acts' by morality, but his only concern is life covered with desires. The reason why this movie is so persuasive is because the town Dogville could be found in everywhere surrounding us in real. It is easy to observe a number of inhumanity and evil deeds in this world. People do not hesitate to beat others if they have much power. The world is more like a movie than a movie is. Therefore, the empty set of Dogville is getting to be filled with this real society while the movie goes. I've been thinking why Dogville makes people including me uncomfortable and appalled. And I guess that's because the character Tom is quite similar to them. Seemingly, look moral and good, but inside, ugly and wicked. And all is killed in the film.It will be interesting to see this movie in terms of religion and Christianity. Is Grace depicted as Jesus here? What about mankind? Is the end of the movie parallel to the Last Judgement?Anyway, Dogville is an amazing movie for me. I might have to take a look on more works of Lars Von Trier.",Dogville

If you are there like me, stuck at the Prologue and surprised to see sets and no real exterior- DO finish it! All else will become secondary to powerful storytelling and the intense observation of human nature- well acted and well scripted.Like other posters here I am not sure why this film is so slated to be a comment on America- I can only see that as being plausible if only America is a country populated human beings and all others- by fancy robots (with European accents, hehe)If Lars Von Trier himself is making such a distinction, then he is belittling this film and I would be very disappointed at such a whiny and bitchy attitude from an intelligent (i'd think) director.",Dogville
164,fanni,Mise en scene d'un dramme,8,19 December 2003,"'Dogville'is a theatrical movie. The action takes place in a closed space and it is divided into chapters which are as a matter of fact scenes.
The drama starts slowly and with good premises: a stranger woman arrives at Dogville, a little town, on the run from a gang of gangsters. Her name is Grace. The little community of Dogville, city of dog, not of God, apparently accepts her and just asks her some work in exchange. And this seems to follow very strictly the protestant morality: you must deserve what you receive.But soon afterwards things change: it is clear that people search her very closely, the risk in harbouring her is increased and Dogville asks more and more. Eventually it becomes too much and there is a break. Grace will not accept their vexations anymore and will take her revenge.Unlike other Lars von Trier's heroines Grace will not submit to evil: she will act her revenge in the name of justice and of the rights of human beings.The drama, very well played indeed by any character, is well constructed: there is a quiet beginning, and abrupt increasing of violence and then the turning point. En excellent movie which demonstrates that it is possible to make movies even with small means.",Dogville
165,WriConsult,"Good, but not the best Dogme film I've seen",7,9 March 2005,"Before reviewing a truly ""theatrical"" film, let me say that I love the theater, but also that I expect a higher standard in plot and script from the theater that I do from film. If a film is going to deliberately evoke the theater like this, it's going to be held to a theatrical standard.As much as I like the idea of the super-simplistic sets and props used in this film -- at least as an intellectual exercise -- I found it to have been taken to such an extreme that it was distracting. Like most moviegoers I'm willing to suspend disbelief for a couple of hours, but this took it too far, much like some action movies that go beyond improbable stunts and effects to physically impossible stunts and effects. Even as I was engrossed in the plot and the predicament of Nicole Kidman's character I couldn't completely ignore all this.Another flaw in this film is the excessive use of voice-over. Voice-over is used to convey information that for one reason or another is not conveyed through set and dialogue. Some of the voice-over in this movie is justified by the lack of information conveyed by the sets, but too much voice-over means there's something wrong with the sets (already discussed) or the script. I wasn't aware that Dogme allows the use of voice-over (an inherently unnatural and often obtrusive technique), but this film illustrates why a revisited Dogme (05?) should probably disallow it.Having mentioned improbability, let's come back to that. I find it unlikely that an entire town of real people anywhere in America (or the world, for that matter) would behave in the coarse and cruel manner that these people did. I have no hesitation to criticize the coarseness, ignorance and insensitivity of American culture when I see it, but if this was indeed intended as a commentary specifically on America then it simply doesn't work. Does von Trier really think that people in Bangladesh or Slovenia -- or Denmark, for that matter -- are not equally capable of such cruel and insensitive behavior? I certainly hope that the hype about this movie's intent is wrong on this point.The level on which this movie does work, however, is as a morality play about human nature in general. Despite the above criticisms, I really wanted to like this film, and found the story and acting compelling. It could have worked spectacularly if the set issues hadn't been so intrusive. 7/10.So far I like the idea of Dogme, but this one's still too stagey and still too obviously an intellectual exercise. For a Dogme film in which the plot and characters are able to truly flourish within the confines of the genre (at least after the first 15 minutes) I heartily recommend ""Italian for Beginners.""",Dogville

168,mccarthystuart,Compelling portrait of human ugliness,7,7 October 2008,"There probably isn't a lot I can say about Dogville that hasn't already been said, but I'll give it a shot, anyway.To begin with, there's the plot; Dogville is set in depression-era America. The plot concerns a young woman, Grace Mulligan (Nicole Kidman) who is fleeing from gangsters, and arrives in a small Colorado backwater town. She asks to take refuge in the town, but the townsfolk are reluctant to take Grace in,but Grave eventually wins them over by offering to do chores for them. All is well until the local police start asking around about Grace. The inhabitants of Dogville demand more work as compensation from Grace, seeing as her continued presence in the town is putting them at risk. It is not long before the ""good"" people of Dogville begin to show their true colours to Grace and eventually enslave her completely. As well as being made to work like a slave, the menfolk have their wicked way with Grace. Grace is also made the town ""scapegoat"" Entually, the townsfolk decide that Grace is becoming too much of a liability to the town, so the local intellectual, Tom Edison Jr. (Paul Bettany) who brought Grace to Dogville in the first place, convinces them to turn Grace over to the gangsters who were looking for her.The stage is set for a shocking ending..............I was absolutely startled by the ""minimalist"" look of the Dogville set, but as the film progressed, I was so engrossed by the story and the acting, that it soon became irrelevant. In spite of the stagy aesthetics, I could still imagine the set looking like a typical small American town of the period-like the kind you'd most likely see in old black-and-white photographs. This is aided by the inclusion of certain visual cues, such as the bell-tower, various windows and furniture.The performances from the cast were great all round. They actually came across as real small-town residents. The only performance I had any problem with was that of Paul Bettany. His acting was good, but for some reason, I just can't get his character in ""Gangster No. 1"" (2000), his first major role out of my head. Kidman imbued her character with the right amount of vulnerability-right up until the end.Special mention should go to John Hurt, as the narrator, who was very articulate and well-spoken in his performance. He sounded like some superior deity looking down on humanity as though they were mere insects. The only outright despicable characters were Chuck (Stellan Skarsgaard) and Vera (Patricia Clarkson).I got so involved with this film, three three-hour duration absolutely sailed by for me. The director, Lars Von Trier, racks up the tension to screaming pitch, beautifully in the last 10 minutes, that I just knew something big is about to happen. The horrific ending is, ironically, quite satisfying. As much as I loved to hate her, I couldn't help but feel sorry for Vera when she was forced to watch her children being murdered by the gangsters. As satisfying as it was to see the people of Dogville get what was coming to them, I was forced to question whether Grace made the right decision in ordering the complete destruction of Dogville and its inhabitants, who were ""bad"" people, but were human like Grace.The song, ""Young Americans"" by David Bowie, which plays during the end credits, feels out of place. This, too, adds to the ""staginess"" of Dogville.Ignore the rants of ""anti-Americanism"". Dogville is a powerful, if unpleasant morality play. Definitely required viewing.",Dogville

In other words, i don't want to know what happens in the movie before I actually see it. That's the cool part about seeing older or foreign movies since many times I will know little about them aside from basic plot.Now, here, i kinda wish I had known how this movie would be filmed, since for the first 15 minutes of the movie, I kept wondering if i had stepped into auditions for the movie or had walked into the filmed play version of the movie. I can't recall seeing any other movie filmed like this. It really shows how important cinematography and sets are to a movie. Not much.Because this was an amazing story. This 3 hour movie felt like it was 80 minutes (As an aside, i just saw a 80 minute movie and it felt like 3 hours).

171,MadiZone,The Beast Within,10,28 May 2007,"This is the sad tale of the township of Dogville. Dogville was in the Rocky Mountains in the US of A, up where the road came to it's definitive end, near the entrance to the old abandoned silver mine. The residents of Dogville were good honest folks, and they liked their township. Or at least, that is what you are led to believe in the beginning of the movie. The residents of Dogville come across as congenial and likable, although slightly reserved.Starting here, the town's newcomer, Grace, initiates an exploration of the residents. Do they like their township? Are they good honest folks? Are they willing to shelter Grace, the fugitive? In order to convince the residents of Dogville to shelter her, she offers to work for them.Initially Grace has nothing to do, because every resident she offers help has nothing that needs to be done.Later on, one of the residents suggests that maybe there is some work that they do not need done, but would like done anyways. And Grace accepts. Suddenly, all the villagers realizes that they indeed do have work they do not need done, but would like done either way.This movie explores the possible outcome of a situation in which a group dominates an individual who is not in a position to say no, for Grace has nothing to barter with. Nothing at all. She is a fugitive on the run from gangsters. She depends on shelter in this distant little village. She has no option but to accept the conditions put forward by the villagers of Dogville.Do the good honest folks of Dogville have the moral standards to protect Grace in her moment of frailty? Does Grace exhibit sufficient respect for her hosts? Dogville runs at almost 3 hours. It is possibly the most powerful movie I have seen in years and it stays with me. It uninhibitedly explores the darker sides of human nature in it's purest form and arrives at a less desirable conclusion.Highly recommended.",Dogville

173,haasxaar,"Lavish in detail, original in theme, haunting in nature",9,9 January 2006,"Von Trier conjured up a real piece of mastery when he wrote and directed 'Dogville'. I am saying this not because of its sheer brilliance of dialogue, its strength of meaning and pure excellence of acting but due to its consummate originality. I, for one have really been screaming out for an end to mainstream cinema's absurd obsession with beautiful sets, gorgeous cinematography and awful lighting arrangements and the constant rehashing of worn-out themes and ideas. Too often directors neglect what the true fundamentals of a film; an intelligent script with discernible characters, an original, yet basic idea which does not need to be dressed up to convey any true power.Von Trier has funnelled his energies into a film that really astounds and disturbs. It does not, like many films, eschew genuine moral revelation. It stays dedicated to its aims, stubbornly refusing to deviate from its purpose.To be more specific; Dogville is a story focusing on the attractive and seemingly innocent fugitive, Grace. She is found one night by a young man who refuses a handsome reward in order to protect this intriguing woman. Consequentially, Grace undergoes various phases to integrate herself into the community of Dogville; and at first it seems that she has succeeded. However, appearances are not all what they seem in Dogville and Grace must find out the hard way how the moral systems and beliefs work in small town U.S.A.Von Trier poses many difficult and elaborate questions to first its characters, and then to his audience. Firstly the moral plethora of small town life would it be in America or in the world; would you be so impartial to actually admit that you would not act in the same manner as Dogville's denizens when they decide to revoke their earlier pledges? Would you be as vindictive and unforgiving had similar circumstances afflicted yourself? Would you not also consider the darkness in the recesses of your own soul and heart? Without impartiality you will never achieve any sort of edification from this film. It is not benign, or unrelenting in any form. Therefore be warned, its coda is not going to ascertain any form of comforting truths of human nature. Disturbing and morbid, yet truly classy and philosophical. Watch it now and learn something about yourself.",Dogville
174,Rash,"Well, its different I grant you!",7,24 August 2005,"*Possible spoiler in first paragraph but nothing to ruin the storyline*To start off with this film takes a bit of getting used to. You are introduced to the story on a stage! That's right, its all shot on one stage and houses, orchard, etc, are made out of chalk outlines - there are no walls or doors. You can see everyone in their houses at all times, though the film pretends there are walls and doors in the way.*End of possible spoiler* I found this bit hard to comprehend at first, plus reading negative opinions by half the people that hated the format, I was about to switch off. But the other half of the people that loved it mentioned the storyline was great as was the acting. Nicole Kidman was indeed brilliant and the rest of the cast did not disappoint either.There was a narrative throughout the film read by John Hurt, whose voice added to the polished finish of the movie. Some places in the movie were starting to get a little tough to digest but there was never a moment where you thought you had to just fast forward to get on with it.The ending was quite decent and the moral of the story stood firm. To be honest the film could have quite easily been shot in an actual depressing, remote shanty town rather than the format chosen by the director (I thought his chosen format was a bit arty farty and probably pretentious for my liking - yet I give him credit for his bravery to try it out).

175,Robbo-7,So sorry if you didn't get it!!!,10,17 May 2004,"My wife and I found the movie to be brilliant and engrossing -- mostly an examination and indictment of human nature, but with a definite critique of America's particular weaknesses. We were so glad to have seen it with no preconceived notions. If you've not seen it yet, I'd recommend avoiding the rest of this review -- some spoilers.I feel sorry for most of the negative reviewers here, who have expressed disappointment that the characters weren't realistic, that the plot needed help, etc. Do these folks get upset about ""unrealistic"" mythology or complain that Jesus couldn't really have turned water into wine?The characters could have been written to be more well-rounded and realistic. Some could have been admirable and others evil, allowing us to identify with the good guys and feel superior to the bad ones. That's the American way. But Von Trier decided to show each character's weak side; each character's propensity to rationalize bad behaviors; each character's willingness to degrade and destroy Grace out of fear that they could never live up to her beauty, empathy, and high ideals. And he decided to show these things in slow, measured detail, giving his audience ample time to marinate in our discomfort.This film raises myriad philosophical questions relevant to modern-day Americans, and others. How much human suffering do we rationalize away for selfish reasons? Is vulnerability inevitably exploited once it becomes exposed? Does capitalism in particular promote such exploitation? What is the essential difference between democracy and mob rule? At what point do our intensely self-interested attitudes and behaviors start to measurably degrade the quality of our society and its claims to moral superiority in the world community? Is cognitive dissonance emerging between our own idealistic vision of America and the world's perception that we've become a different sort of place?",Dogville

I must admit I doubted that this movie would work with the absence of the some of the more ""traditional"" aspects one expects from a movie such as sets , houses , location or even doors for that matter but this very things makes us focus even more so on the actors and they do not disappoint. The story is hypnotic and makes us question what we are as a society . It really angered me to see how poor Grace was abused and treated so horribly by the people of Dogville and I was completely satisfied by her decision at the end . and what can i say about the truly magnificent Nicole Kidman , suffice to say that she is one of the most rivetting , radiant and talented actresses in the world today and I wish her career the very best.",Dogville

Suddenly arrives Grace who is running from some gangsters, the town gives her shelter in return for favors and appear pleasance and then? You have to see it, the tension builds and builds and leads to the best ending I ever saw in a movie, just because the character development made me clench my fists..Lars Von Trier uses a lot of symbols and throws questions right at your face while keeping the story rolling at good pace.There are no ceilings, no walls, but the doors open, you have to see it to be fascinated by such a bold attempt, many people complain this movie to be anti-American but don't American make European satires, I request everyone to see the movie with an open mind..Regarding the acting, though from a movie which assembles Nicole Kidman, Stellan Skarsgard, Paul Bettany, Lauran Bacall, Patricia Clarkson, James Caan and many others would be thought as a typical emotional Drama, but von Trier doesn't demand much from his characters except from Nicole Kidman who was outstanding for her portrayal of Grace..If you have patience for movies with plot development but with rewarding outcome, no one should miss this Masterpiece..",Dogville

Nicole absolutely made this movie. The way she depicts Grace is just amazing.It's one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen. Afterwards, you soak it in. I found myself thinking ""I would never do that..."" This movie is the most surreal, accurate depiction of humanity and it's incredibly chilling.

Once again (especially, after starring in ""Birth""), Nicole Kidman proved to be a very talented actress.But the plot does not give her credit:in the end, when she claims she has forgiven those poor Dogville citizens, she - all of a sudden - approves of the annihilation of the place and its inhabitants.It seems a little illogical and not in the heroine's character.This film is a good mirror to watch ourselves critically.",Dogville

There is a clumsy statement, communicated as cleverly and subtly as a seventy-foot billy goat. Such flat characters are not vehicles for a statement. Every character is a device, a rusty farm implement. I found it impossible to care about any of them. Patricia Clarkson is almost always disappointing, and Chloe Sevigny is almost always in need of a bath. When combined, even in old-fashioned clothes, they are more than a person can be expected to handle. And the underdeveloped setting did not achieve the effect of making the town into any town. It became no town at all. Something so foreign quickly becomes irrelevant. And it was long, like ""Dances with Wolves."" But there was no dancing. There were no wolves. No Indians. Nothing.

183,ununchanged,sorry...,3,19 December 2011,"As well made as it may be, the message of this movie gets down right stupid if you break it down to its core... What have we got here? I sum up the story: A girl who ran away from ""some gangsters"" gets taken in by some mountain town folk. The townspeople are nice at first but after some time, they become more and more abusive until a ridiculously disgusting degree is reached. They end up calling the gangsters to get rid of the girl, but it turns out she is the daughter of some mafiaboss and the whole town gets machinegunned and burnt preferably in a horrible fashion.Besides the fact that this story is incredibly unrealistic altogether and she prolly could have left the village at any point, whats happening is displayed in a context of an extremely misunderstood Christian-moral of forgiveness and punishment... The whole town is incredibly judgemental from the start, and as friendly and understanding as the girl maybe her personality would shine in a very different light if the viewer knew her background story from the start...The point in Christian religion is less ""forgiveness"" and a lot more ""not judging"" people... There isn't anything arrogant about ""not judging people"" that because what it essentially means is: ""I wont judge other people, cause i know i will always be just biased as they are."" Aka: my opinion is NOT better than anybody elses. Which is the absolute opposite of arrogance. NOT imposing your judgement on anybody else is whats important, its the whole point. When Miss ""my dads a gangsterboss"" in the end ""morally"" decides to shoot everybody in the town she IS judging them by her VERY own standards and not a bit better then they were.Did the author really think the world we live in is so full of forgiveness that he needed to teach a lesson like that to the earth????? An eye for an eye? If we'd live by that standard nobody would be alive because the big problem in everybodys nature is, that we tend to be biased towards our own judgement which again and again results in situations where two partys are committing horrible crimes because they each are convinced of their ultimate rightfullness.",Dogville
184,oppaimauspad,About what I expected,6,12 April 2021,"Don't let people who are known criminals into your society :)Lars makes this such a brutally boring and simple movie as if to point out how painfully obvious this should be to people.Kid man is a miserable character and I detested her all the way through. Avoid people like her in life. Her life philosophy is evil and the world is filled with people like her.Make no mistake, she is a predator. She comes from a family of predators, snakes. And it is only in their nature to consume the town. The town was filled with idiots who have succumbed to sin. If you sin, you are more susceptible to predators.Lars von Trier understands morality but I'm not so sure which side of the coin he falls on. Does he see morality as a useful tool to manipulate people? Did he himself want to genocide the people of Dogville? The contempt with which he writes the citizens would indicate so.",Dogville
185,Neucosa,Obvious and Boring,2,22 December 2007,"Although I appreciated the highly staged and play-like nature of the film, it failed miserably. The film continued along, monotonously pounding the same uninspired thought again and again as the film progressed. It is possible that people who enjoy Lars van Trier's other films will find something more in this film, but there is no nuance for me. There is nothing but a sledgehammer. No interesting use of language. No use of the abilities of the actors. Wretched, honestly. It seemed as though a 13 year old wanted to tell a story and didn't have the tools in order to add complexity or honest human experience to the tale. van Trier continues his misogynism in this film as the female characters seem to act without any thought to their future, their surroundings or any possibilities. Very sad indeed.I'm also amazed by the pretentiousness of people who commented on liking the film. I totally don't understand it. Have they never seen a well-crafted film before? This film had no more than 20 minutes of interest before it dissolved into a class project. Uncreative. Boring. oh...and pretentious.Abusively uncrafted films such as these should not be even reviewed by more than the teacher of the class.",Dogville

187,eagle_owl,Challenges the boundaries of what we can expect from films.,7,19 April 2005,"Nicole Kidman stars in this extraordinary film as Grace, a woman on the run from mobsters, who is taken in by the residents of a small and isolated town called Dogville. Gradually the townsfolk turn against her, and blackmail her into accepting increasing levels of abuse, but there's a twist in the tale.The film's most startling feature is the fact that all the action takes place on a set, representing the town, with no buildings and no scenery. When viewed from above, the town has the appearance of a giant Cluedo board. This has the effect of making the town seem far smaller than it normally would.This is far more than just a stylistic flourish. As the audience is able to see through walls, they can view everything that goes on in the town, provided of course that the camera is pointing in the right direction. This emphasises the elusiveness of privacy in a small community where everyone knows everyone else's secrets.While the townspeople act as if the walls are solid, in fact they are only too aware of what goes on behind closed doors, but won't act to disturb the superficial calm. This makes a negative suggestion about human nature; that given the chance human beings will exploit vulnerable people rather than protecting them.Because there is no scenery to serve as a distraction, the viewer's attention is solely focused on the performances, which are uniformly superb. Kidman demonstrates that despite her star status she is not averse to taking risks, and Paul Bettany is excellent as the man who tries to defend her against the rest of the townsfolk.Dogville challenges the boundaries of what we can expect from films, and does so with considerable success. The only downside is the end credits, which unnecessarily court controversy, and spoil an otherwise subtle film, which deserved better.",Dogville
188,foxx_1,Self-indulgent turgid pseudo-art,1,14 February 2006,"First of all, I would not call this a film. It is an experiment gone bad and an insult to real cinematography. Actors walking around on a soundstage, houses marked only with white lines on the floor, and on top of that - a narrator explaining with a stern voice what is going on! What an original approach... Obviously only the sublime mind of self proclaimed connaisseurs is meant to truly appreciate this landmark in style and substance! I still wonder why Trier didn't go further and discard all the superfluous clichés the mediocre audience is used to e.g. why see the actors all the time while he could have shown only their shadows instead! This would have meant a new level of symbolism and caused all the jaw dropped admirers to tremble with pleasure.Some of you might think of Lars Trier as a genius and deem the so called Dogma 95 an ultimate achievement in creativity and imagination. I don't. I would rather consider the Dogma 95 and the above film snobbish pseudo-elitist mental onanism that serves mainly one purpose: giving a group of opinionated so called ""intellectuals"" a self-validation tool which has to prove their mental superiority ""You - unlike us - don't understand deep art..."" I don't mind the fact that he chose to focus on the dialog instead of the scenery - Sidney Lumet (""12 Angry Men"") has shown us that a film can be set in one single room and still be grasping and intriguing. Ettore Scola (""Le Bal"") proved that a film does not even need any dialog and still touch you. And Lars Trier amply demonstrates that he can have a great cast and storyline with a potential - and produce nothing but huge flatulence. By the way, I recommend re-reading ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" - ironically, written by another Dane...",Dogville
189,ChelseaGirl98,A powerful film,8,22 May 2006,"I disagree with many of the film critics' comments about this movie. I don't see it as anti-American at all; in fact, one of the characters (Chuck, I believe), says to Grace that people are the same everywhere you go. Presumably, this means it's not just Americans von Trier is condemning but people in general. I've heard he dislikes the U.S., but even if that's true, I don't really care. Everything that happens in this film is real. People can be petty, vindictive, suspicious, small-minded, and just plain mean. The ball-and-chain thing was exaggerated to make a point, but even that isn't so far-fetched--we've all read about parents who chained their kid to a radiator. Roger Ebert says in his review, ""I doubt that we have any villages where the helpless visitor would eventually be chained to a bed and raped by every man in town."" Well, Roger, the town had only around 15 or 16 people, not counting the young children. Are you so naive as to think that a group of 15 people isn't capable of doing this? I wonder what world you're living in.At first, I wasn't certain that the filming of the movie as a play, the chalk drawings, etc., added anything to the movie. But after thinking about it, I've changed my mind. The stage set made everything seem more closed and gave a very claustrophobic feeling, which has to be what the director intended.The acting was superb, and while I've never been a big Nicole Kidman fan, this is the best performance I've seen from her. Even though the movie was three hours, I wasn't bored. But if you like action-oriented films, don't bother with this one. This film is more about ideas.Dogville is the kind of movie that stays with you. The ending was extremely powerful. Just as I changed my mind about the stagey filming, I also changed my mind about the ending. I initially thought it was impossible that Grace could have reversed herself that quickly. One minute she was talking about the town's humanity, making excuses for their behavior by saying that she might have done the same things, and discussing forgiveness--and about two minutes later, she gave the order to destroy the town. But after thinking about it, I realized that Grace didn't change. She was that way all along. She said she was running away from someone, but that someone was herself.",Dogville
190,dr_salter,Misguided dull acting from Kidman,3,24 January 2007,"Kidman plays a gangster's (James Caan's) daughter, who is surrounded by criminals and so wants to escape the vicious side of life and live in peace and quiet in the country. But once she's gained 'refugee status' in Dogville by working hard each day for the townspeople, Grace is soon being taken advantage of by the poor country folks, who slowly become a replacement for the criminals. Grace's problem (and she gains a few dilemmas over the weeks) is that she does not set her boundaries or demand justice. Even refugees have rights. Her voice is very well modulated and the girl never raises her voice, except once when she yells at Vera's young son stating that she will not physically spank the boy (and then she does hit him!). Bad move Grace. This bad action is supposed to show the townspeople that Grace is immoral and not trustworthy and so this automatically opens her up for further exploitation and degradation, which includes being used for sexual relief by all the men in town. (Thankgoodness the women are not lesbians.)So, now we see who's trustworthy, truthful... and what's immoral. But Grace just lies back and takes it! WHY? I feel she should get a bit angry but doesn't seem to show any reactions till the end.Actually, I dreaded watching Dogville because I do not feel that Nichole Kidman has any right to be accredited as a leading actress, in the category of Liv Ulman. In Dogville, Kidman is a pale insipid disappointment and so was James Caan as her gangster Daddy. They are obviously only worried about showing their good side to the cameras (Kidman's wispy hair was a worry!) and they were not able to bring out the truth needed to portray the underlying faults in the characters.The script was ably supported by the other lesser known actors and even the great actress Lauren Bacall looked scruffy for the part.This movie was supposed to be a representation of a stage play on screen so what's with the user comments about ""where's the scenery?"" For goodness sakes- grow up people! Dogville should be watched as a film about justice, trust, trustworthiness, assertiveness, conscience and faith in humanity, which is what you see in any Shakespeare production so maybe HEY!... Dogville's script is up there with the best? And it's good because IT MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT HOW WE ATTAIN A Truly MORAL SOCIETY GUYS.I reckon they should make Dogville again without Kidman and Caan and see what happens. It'll open your eyes and your hearts for sure.",Dogville

I give it a few points for going out on a limb with the style, but again, it just feels like something a very high college student would come up with the day before the script was due. And it was a one-trick pony, the sense of style was never used effectively for anything else. It contributed absolutely nothing to the movie.The acting was fine, just terribly dull. Never felt the slightest connection to anyone, or felt that any situation was any more than a ridiculous farce; everything happened not because it naturally follows from the characters and events, but because it had to happen to move the plot forward. Everyone but Grace is basically a hive mind who feel everything in perfect lockstep with each other, like a good fable. The brutality followed the generic revenge flick arc trod by hundreds of other movies, even the narrator just felt utterly pointless and jarring, instead of quaint and unusual.Obviously, there are quite a few people who love it.

192,rsampron,One Word: Brilliant,9,29 March 2007,"Perhaps you're old enough to remember when NBC aired Thornton Wilder's ""Our Town"" as a teleplay back in the late 70s, featuring Robbie Benson and Glynnis O'Connor as George and Emily, and Hal Holbrook as the stage manager. It was an excellent production that featured minimalist sets which helped focus attention on the story and its message. Think of ""Dogville"" is ""Our Town's"" dark, brooding, tragic twin, with elements of a very dark Walton's episode thrown in for good measure. The same use of stark set decoration proves absolutely riveting. This film is an intense experience from beginning to end, even though we all know what happens to us mortals when we refuse a visit from Grace, ala the Biblical story of Sodom.The acting is a thing of wonder. It turns out Nicole Kidman isn't really a movie star. She's an independent film siren, and this is not her only indie. I dare go no further for fear of spoiling the film. It usually runs in America on cable/satellite on IFC: Independent Film Channel, and is well worth seeing.",Dogville
193,santiagonunez16,Stays with you,10,22 May 2014,"I had no desire to see this movie because I'm no fan of Nicole Kidman but a friend recommended I see this. This is probably one of the most original movies to come out in years and I'm sorry I missed it in 2003. Everything about this movie is terrific. The way it's filmed so simple, major Hollywood filmmakers should take notes that you don't need 100million in special effects to make a movie good. The movie's filmed from a state set, small prop pieces, few items here and there but it works. Good performances make this movie work and I must admit I was rooting for Nicole Kidman's character to come through. Be warned, this is a hard movie to watch. In fact, I still can't get it out of my head. Certain scenes will make you cringe and a shock of an ending will just sort of make you depressed. The story is very simple, so are the characters, and the setting. Kidman's character shows up one day in an ordinary town. She's running from something and so her whole reason for being is mysterious. Who is she and where did she come from? She meets one of the locals who allow her to stay in the town in exchange for doing chores for the people who live there. Eventually, they agree to vote on her staying but at the same time, take advantage of her. she is kind and well meaning, even trying to better the town's attitude toward one another. This is where the story gets complicated. Soon she is mistreated to the point of rape by the men of the town and is offered no help or support from the women. Each character of this town is revealed to be so vile, even the kids are heartless and cold. Over time, it becomes clear, there is no redemption in this town. The ending, not going to give it away but the payoff is shocking. In addition to the display of violence and sexual perversity displayed throughout the movie, it's like a hammer hitting the nail on it's head. Had this been an actual play and not a movie, this would have won every major award of the stage. I can't even begin to imagine the intensity of seeing something played out like this on a live stage. This would have become a global phenomenon and much like it is on film, talked about for years to come.",Dogville
194,hosolo,Stage play masquerading as movie but good ending,7,4 October 2006,"Before watching this film/theater experience, I read some reviews claiming it was anti-American or Americans hated it. But then why were so many American actors in it, including the legendary Bacall and James Caan. After finishing this 3 hour stage play, which concluded with some unflattering depression era photos to the tune of David Bowie's ""Young Americans"", I found the anti-American sentiment wasn't really justified. The first hour begins with a narrator introducing the town and townspeople of Dogville. Tom (Paul Bettany) is Dogville's spokesperson. Tom meets Grace (Kidman) and helps her escape from some gangsters. He introduces Grace to the townspeople and tells them Grace's predicament. The story then proceeds with overbearing narration, and is told through ""chapters"", almost like visualizing a book on tape.The movie set or lack thereof is that of a stage. Now, I've always liked theater actors, they're raw and inspired and that's what I liked about the bare scenery in this ""film"", the actors had to ""improvise"" their actions, of closing a door, of raking leaves and this is one of the positive things in the movie. But by the 2nd hour when after the ""townspeople"" show Grace their true colors and they treat her with indifference and humiliate her, including all the town's male population raping her, I started to feel a little bit of that ""hatred"". It seemed the harassment would never cease and Tom was just a wimp. The only reason for not stopping the film was ""Grace's surprise"". Indeed, when James Caan, finally appears, and an extremely engaging argument between Grace (Kidman) and The Big Man (Caan) about ""arrogance"" takes place, viewing Dogville in its entirety became worthwhile. If the United States can be criticized for one thing, it's ""arrogance"", though in this film the ""arrogance"" was about people in general.Dogville is a drama on a sound stage and has fine acting from Kidman. Caan was good too but Bacall was underused. The rest of the ensemble cast as standard theater actors, were methodical but effective. Anyone who wants to view a ""unique"" film, should give Dogville a chance, but be prepared, there is a lot of unpleasantness. 7.0/10",Dogville

Actors can be lured into anything -no matter how ridiculous or humiliating this anything might be- provided their agents tell this anything is ""artistic"".Since Europa (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101829/), a very interesting movie, Lars Von Triers started his steep decline, after Dogville he actually stopped it: he reached the very bottom.By the by, who this moralist wanna-be does he think he is to equal the anonymous people in the pictures on the ending titles with the bunch of slobbering mangy poachers inhabiting the Dogville in his head.One of the most important characteristics of America is her tolerance to criticism, as far as I know there is no other society willing to pay to be vilified and even to praise the vilifier.Just to conclude, this endeavor -the utterance of implacable moral criticism toward certain American issues- can be found in the fiction of Theodore Dreisser, John Steinbeck, William Faulkner, Tennessee Williams, Truman Capote, Carson Mc Cullers, H.L. Mencken who are all American writers by the way.The difference between them and Mr. Von Triers, is a crystal-clear one: they were not mere show-offs desperately trying to judge what they thoroughly ignored; quite on the contrary, they were poets (some better than others) trying to find a truth and express it as a thing of beauty.The idea of poor people portrayed as vile is thoroughly fascist.This movie reminds me the nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels who used to say: ""tell the biggest lie you can and repeat it often and eventually people will believe it""",Dogville

No doors.. it seemed like some sort of play/movie hybrid but after a shortwhile all those things faded away until I realized how much I would have missed if I had turned it off - it is now one of my favourite movies of all time.Why? It is so brave to criticse humanity like this and admit just how 'dark' a race we truly are - not matter how much each of us profess to being 'good', we all know that most of us are anything but. Through this movie you see a woman who learns the cold harsh truth in a place where she expected to find the goodness that her faith told her existed. And then on not finding it, discovered that even within her lay a wrath that echoed the darkness that she herself wished did not feature so dominant in our race. And the biggest test of this is to observe your own emotions throughout this movie until what you feel at the end as perfect evidence...I honestly believe those people that don't believe what this movie is expressing needs to take a cold hard look around them. And if they still don't believe, they are just like the people in this movie - unwilling to see the truth and coming up with excuses and reasons when nothing justifies the horrible world we live in.A true masterpiece - one of the few pure pieces of art in cinema with amazing acting from Nicole Kidman especially, and the lack of a set causes you to be immersed in the characters like no other movie. And its 'them' and human nature that is the focus. Will leave you thinking and astounded (unless you don't like to think and can't watch a movie that isn't afraid to do something unique, in which case there a countless movies for 'you').",Dogville
202,WheelerClown,I appear to be in the minority because I hated it.,2,2 January 2005,"Perhaps if the DVD box had warned me that I would be viewing a ""teleplay"" instead of an actual movie, I might have approached it differently. As it was, the bad cuts (for example, Kidman is lying down one second and suddenly sitting up the next) were very disruptive to me getting anything out of the movie, as was the lack of scenery and props. But most of all the movie was much too dark for my tastes. While the adult citizens of Dogville may have deserved their final fate, the children did not (with the possible exception of the one bratty boy who wanted a spanking). That part of the ending at least was not something one would have expected Nicole Kidman's character to do, even given what the adults had done to her.All of that said, I will admit that Nicole Kidman acting shone as brightly as ever, as did Lauren Bacall's and a few of the others. But I couldn't help wondering what in the world would have made them be a part of such a movie. Maybe Bacall's opportunities to act are fading with her advancing age. But Kidman owes it to herself and her public to hold out for roles and movies of a much higher standard than Dogville.",Dogville
203,arndt-pawelczik,Anti-film,1,8 August 2012,"If you don't like films, you'll probably love this one. Lars von Trier does everything in his power to deconstruct the medium. This would at least be an interesting approach, if only the story this film tells were not so predictable, banal and clichéd. Mr von Trier gives us the most basic of fairy tales, where the poor defenseless innocent (Kidman) is set upon by all the wicked witches and bad stepmothers the Grimm brothers have ever collated. All the characters are one-dimensional and clichéd, but supposedly this does not matter, because the director has chosen such a daring, neo-Brechtian/Piscatorian approach to the art direction. Let's not put up sets! Let's keep the sound stage bare and just draw on outlines of buildings. This is so radical, people will think I am a genius. Unfortunately this ploy has worked. People do think Mr von Trier is a genius. Well, I think the emperor is wearing no clothes! For me the word that summarizes DOGVILLE best is ""childish"". Although ""boring"" and ""interminable"" come a close second. I like films, so I'm afraid DOGVILLE is not for me.",Dogville
204,acandiani,"film, theatre, dogma, Lars is confused",6,19 July 2004,"I cannot truly say that I liked or disliked the film. Lars Von Trier surprises us once again. At least no one is singing or dancing this time. The fact is that I don't think this is a film. It's a theatre piece. It's like going to a theatre and recording the scenes one after the other. Everything is left to the imagination but is that a film? Nicole Kidman is as poor and vague and detached as usual and maybe she just went to Sweden on holidays to ski, who knows. On the contrary, Ben Gazzarra, Lauren Bacall, James Caan and rest of the crew seem to do the minimum but with such a strong charisma that one can endure the experience of watching the story as it unfolds. Actually, the story is pretty ordinary and very dry, almost an in-between 'early Lars' and 'Dogma Lars'. Not sure.... And also, why would anyone want to watch that again?

The whole film, shot in one studio with minimal props and set decoration, sounded like a fantastic, experimental idea, but turned out a great disappointment. All through the film (wich is way, way to long - and I love long films, if anyone...) there is an obviousness to everything, and a taste of nothingness (imagine eating chocolate with the taste of nothing). You can feel what direction the plot is going and nothing surprises you, even the least. A note on the style of shooting, the so called dogma-style, is in my opinion not suited for full-length-projects. It's visual style has a feeling of unprofessional-ism over it, especially when it's constantly shot with a vibrating camera. I have seen work done in the HDV-format and there is nothing wrong with that, but Von Trier f**ks it up. In my opinion, he is just lazy and cheap.In short, Von Trier is the arrogant one (and all his work has a grown more and more pretentious and uninteresting), and it shines through the entire project. Mostly i felt bored, and like I threw away almost 3 hours of my life on this dung.",Dogville
206,IHStudent,it's great,10,24 October 2003,"`Dogville' is the new film of Lars von Trier. It's one of the most interesting movie of this year. The story tells about small village in the USA and  it's set  at the beginning of the XX century. We can show the stars, like Nicole Kidman. The young woman arrives to Dogville. She escapes, because the dangerous gangsters want to catch her. Tom, a young man, who wants to be a writer, helps her. He is going to verify if the people of Dogville will accept unknown girl. At the beginning they are good for Grace, but than their way of thinking and behaviour changes completely.This movie is extraordinary: the scenography is like in the theatre and the camera is moving all the time. In our opinion this is very important film about human nature. You have to ask yourself, where is the line between  being victim and oppressor.",Dogville
207,stevendecastro,Dogville's a Dog!,2,5 September 2015,"It is a fascinating production premise of shooting on a presentational set design (that is, drawing chalk lines and bidding the audience to imagine that the walls are there). This is the stuff of theater, and Lars Von Trier forces the presentational method into that of movies, which are usually representational in design. But that's the only kudos I can give to this boring, badly written movie with overbearing on-the-nose narration, and awkward lines. Cinematography was distractingly bad as well. I believe that the idea was to simulate the feeling of seeing a stage play, so almost the entire movie is shot with extremely long lenses from 50 feet away, which feels, obviously, like you're watching a movie from fifty feet away.Now the Flannery O'Connor-like moral allegory in the story is what many people comment on, and regarding that, I would like to give Mr. Von Trier one, no two, very big middle fingers.The root of all evil is not found in poor and working class white people. I'm sure that there are bad people among regular rednecks. But why pick on them? Because they don't fit into some liberal category for pity?On the positive, I thought that Nicole Kidman was great.",Dogville
208,barleeku,"Riveting, brilliant cinema",10,7 July 2005,"When Dogville started I was skeptical since I was watching it on the treadmill where I prefer a good old-fashioned cinematic narrative. But the combination of a fantastic script, stunning acting, hypnotic pacing, great camera-work that makes the most out of a brilliantly designed set, and luscious layers of metaphor make this one of my favorite movies of the past 10 years. If nothing else, Dogville makes me realize that Tom Cruise is a bigger idiot than I thought he was, as Nicole Kidman is so luminous, intelligent, and downright gorgeous in this that it's amazing she hooked up with Planet Sci-Cruise in the first place. That aside, everyone is fantastic, including Gazzara, Bacall, Blair Brown, and James Caan. I saw the movie, on one level, as a metaphor for the worst of America, as well as a meditation on the way the movies have dealt with the Depression and our history in general. Kidman's name - Grace - of course, gives it all a nice theological touch - a sort of gnostic fantasy, and the dialectic debate towards the end of the movie (not a spoiler although it would be if one names the characters who conduct it) is powerful not just for the content and the acting, but the context and outcome. The consolation of philosophy! I'm not surprised it received so many 1's in the voting - if the movie doesn't grab you, it can really turn you off, but if it does grab you, you're in for a riveting experience.",Dogville

The normal guy who just likes watching movies loves it. Without saying much about the plot, the tale of Dogvilled does an amazing job of looking at the human soul and revealing soooo much about ourselves. The ""look"" of the film is original and yet, very effective. This movie chilled me to my soul. I recommend it because of it's powerful message (regardless of whether or not you like it).

210,rexbot,A masterpiece that is not for all.,10,18 April 2004,"About Me: Avid movie goer. See 2-3 films in theaters a week.This is a different sort of film which asks a lot of its audience.  Several of the people in the theater where I viewed the film walked out after the first 1/2 hour or so.The previews that I was exposed to for the film did a very poor job indeed of preparing me for what I was to see.  For you see the the things that one expects to see in a typical film remain unseen in this one. Usually the scenery and location of the film are used to help tell the story and to add context and meaning to the background of the story.Not here.Here there are just the very bare essentials of props and scenery used, less even than most live stage performances.  It is a bit shocking and mind-blowing to realize all at once that the entertainment is going to be constructed entirely of dialog and acting.  I'm sure it is something like what the first art-patrons went through when subjected to the first bits of minimalist art.  At first there is shock of what isn't there.  Then there is even grater shock at how it brings more clearly into focus that which is (if one can get over the initial shock that is).As we are drawn into the story however little by little we no longer care about the way in which the film is constructed as the story itself is compelling and interesting enough by far on its own merits.  I will not go into the story other than to say it is something of a tale of the human condition from all points of view  and a lesson in what morality really is. It has the ring of truth and is therefore compelling.In short I would recommend this film very highly but with a warning that one must go into the film with an open mind.  If you do so I believe you will be richly rewarded.Cast: OK.  No stunning performances but each cast member does their job well.Cinematography: Excellent.Story/Plot: Interesting, entertaining, and well thought out.Editing/Direction: Very very well done.  Always at a good pace which doesn't sprint or drag which is a good thing indeed for a 3 hour film!Overall Rating: 10/10",Dogville
211,Thomas_S,Pseudo-intellectual trash,3,8 November 2008,"Watching this movie is like eating a bread as its separate ingredients before they are mixed or baked. It's only because the director's name is Trier that he can get away with this. Making a movie in a studio without a set may be a different idea, but it's not a good one. Intellectually refreshing, perhaps, but very boring, and the whole thing drags out for too long time. The actors don't seem comfortable doing this either, and the dialogue and acting have an artificial 'feel' throughout. As for the plot, it's nothing special at all. Throughout the movie, I waited for something to make it a worthwhile exercise, and for a long time after having seen it, I continued searching for that 'yes, got the idea!' feeling, but it never came. To be fair, I avoided posting an opinion for several months. But it's the Emperor's New Clothes (which is written by a Dane, Hans Christian Andersen - Trier is Danish too). Trier is not stupid and he must have had a purpose making this. I can see two potential purposes: 1. The irony of the Emperor's New Clothes also being written by a Dane. 2. Trier being amused by pseudo-intellectuals praising this trash to the sky, well knowing that it really isn't good, and waiting to see if people can figure out the Emperor's New Clothes connection.",Dogville

LOL.A lot of praise has gone Von Trier's way in the past - this was the first movie I've seen from him and now I'm really interested in his previously over-hyped movies. Almost all the way through this was a very interesting one that kept my eyes peeled. The characters were ALIVE and the story was unpredictable, although simple. Might have been that I was so fascinated by the milieu and great acting that I was blinded by the obviousness of it all - now this is a feeling I haven't had in a long time watching a movie.Lars Von Trier and Nicole Kidman deserve Oscars for this, but then again I think all the actors and the whole damn crew deserve them.Brilliant.",Dogville
213,pfranklin,A Most Unique and Exceptional Stage Play on Film,9,14 April 2005,"This film is really much more of a stage play than what one would normally think of as a film. I simply couldn't imagine it having as much impact if it were a traditional movie. That being said it is very difficult to objectively review this film or stage play. Obviously the script, acting, and direction were excellent. But that falls short of any type of review.The storyline is what makes this work somewhat unique. It is something of a black philosophical look at human nature. And what makes it rather exceptional is the historical reality of the Great Depression era it so carefully depicts. It asked some tough questions of human nature in difficult times, and it does so eloquently with purpose and strength. Even though this is the equivalent of a nine-act stage play it does not drift or drag. It stays on point building up to a climax that the viewer does or does not necessarily expect.I simply liked this for all of the obvious reasons that anyone would enjoy a fine work of art, but I found exceptionally unique in its sense of purpose while being entertaining. In my opinion this is an exceptional and unique stage play produced on film. It's certainly worth the nearly three hours it takes to view it.",Dogville

Eject.It appears that a lot of people liked this film, but I can't understand how they sat through 3 hours of an unchanging set. It became distracting to the point where any merit the film may have had was masked by the fact that the visual elements were the equivalent of staring at a dot for three straight hours; it's like making a movie by filming pages of a book; why bother?Dogville should only exist as a play; it'd be much easier to avoid.2/10, because 1/10 is probably ignored.",Dogville
215,imdb-3362,Interesting solution,8,12 November 2004,"Quite an interesting solution to the troubles of small-town, rural America in the end there. It takes a bit of getting used to the stark set, but the minimalist approach to the lowest common denominator in human behavior does work after a while.Nicole Kidman executes her role with admirable precision, although the final scenes appear to hold the middle-ground between being contrived and looking for a quick and dramatic finish after two hours of walking pace. I don't think I was the only one who suspected that there was more to the gangster story that brought Nicole to town than 'just an occasion to get her there'. The movie managed to close the circle, but with a bit of a clank. Or with a bell, to remain in style.The display of basic human avarice, meanness and lack of self-restraint is presented in a convincing way by the rest of the cast.One thing that did bother me quite a bit was the uneven camera work. In a (somewhat overestimated and overused) attempt to pull the audience into the scenes by becoming 'their eyes', a lot of nervous and shaky images, especially present when performing fast 90-degree pans and when trying to keep up with a moving actor in close-up, presented at least me with a mild, but annoying headache after a while. I would have preferred a more smooth, 'steadicam' approach to this embellished (and slightly long) stage-play. After all, when I look at something up close, I don't usually shake my head all the time, nor do I rotate on my heels to look behind me. This is a dead and dull town; it doesn't need a speedy, giddy treatment.Anyway, interesting exercise, captivating set of circumstances, and fuel on the fire of the misanthropists, who know they're right in the end. And who would have loved to re-enact the last chapter for real, had they not been kind fools at heart, and hating themselves for it.8/10",Dogville
216,DocFilm,Pure Good draws the Shadow to it.,8,31 May 2004,"Grace does not exist in a state of grace, but rejects the evil which is her legacy (her right of inheritance of power from her gangster father).  She is the mythic transformational stranger who arrives on the scene -- we expect her to be a catalyst.  However she denies her Shadow (the evil in herself) and the Shadow of the townsfolk by being all good and all forgiving, respectively.  Thus she draws out the evil all too ready to emerge from the townsfolk.  With repression, without consciousness of their Shadows, their evils overwhelm them, transforming the townsfolk into arrogant evil doers. It is as though in the Christian story Christ's goodness and forgiveness transformed his opponents and attracted his persecution.  Her stance is an arrogant one, as explicated in the dialog between Grace and her father.  Likewise, the townsfolk are arrogant in their denial of their Shadows and the projection of their Shadows on to Grace. The final scene leaves the protagonists acting out their evil: the arrogance of pure evil (without mercy) is no better than the arrogance of pure good.  Only the audience has the consciousness which can contain the tragedy of both.This film has a mythological flavor, like a Greek tragedy, like von Trier's earlier Medea, hence the archetypal, non-complex nature of the characters and the directing, the minimalist staging, and the narration, which is comic in its fairy-tale   just-so style interspersed with choric comments on the tragedy, but in the same style.

I started watching it at 1am thinking I'd just watch a bit of it and finish it today. As it was, I ended up going to bed just before 4am and couldn't get to sleep for an hour because I couldn't stop thinking about this film.Someone I once loved very much told me a long time ago that Nicole Kidman's character in this film reminded him of me. People usually always tell me that I am Kate Winslet's character in Eternal Sunshine... so , since I knew absolutely nothing about Dogville, I was expecting Kidmans character to be something like that.Of course, Grace was very different and I can't work out if the comparison to myself was an insult? That is certainly not how I see myself, but then again, the version of the person you are is completely different to everyone who knows you. If that's who I was/am to my old friend, then so be it. But I really hope I'm not.Anyway - I really liked this film a lot in so many ways. There were things I didn't like as much, but then nothing is ever perfect. As von Trier is all too aware of, so many films are so utterly forgettable the minutes the credits roll which is certainly not something you can say about Dogville, whether you liked it or not.My personal measure of a films worth to me is whether or not I'd watch it again with my other half.

Unfortunately it is bogged down by a turgid and tedious script which tends to cause laughter at inappropriate times due to the appalling dialogue - at times I felt like I was watching outtakes from ""Waiting For Guffman"". The narration is probably the most ghastly aspect of it, as it fails to add anything apart from droll exposition. The voice-over during the 'porcelain-smashing' scene was simply an insult to all screenwriting.Added to this terrible script is abysmal direction - the jerky camera work and dreadful edits are useful in a tense psychological script, but using it during an inane ""I love you - well I love you too"" scene was just embarassing. The purpose of a cut mid-sentence during a Kidman monologue eludes me completely. I'm a big fan of technical devices, but only as long as they serve the story. Here it reeked of ""look at me - I'm being radical!""While I can see the parable aspect, the drastic transition from ""town full of lovely simple close-knit people"" to ""town full of lying, raping, sado-masochistic psychopaths"" was way too extreme and hence just rendered the whole scenario as absurd. This film could have been very good - it was a story worth telling and it featured a cast that were more than capable of telling it.

219,gouge_away,Reference to Edison a criticism of contemporary films?,9,29 November 2004,"***Spoilers***Let me start my review by saying that this film accomplishes what most filmmakers hope for when they begin the mountainous task of creating one: it provokes and engages the viewer's mind. I will not review the film's plot because prior posts have amply covered the many questions that are presented and only partly answered. This was an unforgettable film for me even though I do not accept its ideological foundations.One of the subtextual layers of the film involves what I see as a severe criticism of the film industry as a whole. I'm sure that most readers are aware of Lars von Trier's grievances. In many ways, the things he has said about modern cinema ring true. How many times have we viewers left the movie hall, after watching the latest blockbuster, shaking our heads? The special effects may have astounded us, but the characters seemed petty and one-dimensional, or even worse, a GLORIFICATION of all that is bad about our culture. I emphasized the word ""glorification"" in the previous sentence because I do not believe that a film should ignore the bad - just that it shouldn't make the antagonist the hero.The moving picture was invented by Thomas Edison. Because of him, we have the gift of film. Dogville begins with a father/son duo named after this famous inventor and it is here that I detect a critique of contemporary films. The younger Tom struggles to come up with a story; he wants to create something of value but he can only manage a meager three words. He walks around Dogville wanting to help its citizens, but he cannot relate to their situations. He, unlike them, does not have any financial worries because he lives with his father, Thomas Edison Sr., who brings in a comfortable pension.Tom the younger is living off of his father's success. (Edison Sr. represents old Hollywood and is presented in a kinder light than the other town residents - i.e., he does not molest Grace.) Ineffectual in influencing his culture, young Tom is the first to recognize that Grace, played by Kidman, is a gift. He introduces her to the townspeople.Grace is accepted by the townspeople and for a while all are content to share in her sunshine. But then, the benefactors begin to long for a greater exploitation of Grace. Through Tom the younger's mediation, they seek more ""balance"" from their relationship with Grace. No longer interested in her goodness and humanity, they want physical gratification at her expense (and ultimately Tom's). Tom eventually goes along with them and is corrupted himself. (Tom, representing modern cinema, panders to them by wooing Grace even as he furthers her captivity. He gives them the equivalent of the gratuitous sex scene, car chase, or mass explosion with resulting body count.)Grace leaves Dogville and, in the spirit of the Dogme manifesto, decides that the world would be better off if the current societal malaise were eradicated, along with all of the money and capital of the modern film industry. Hence, Grace provides the coup de grace to young Tom.",Dogville
220,wfrost,"This is a cautionary tale about human nature -- how a few ""good people"" turn from being a woman's protector into her tormentor.",7,1 January 2008,"Set in a small village in the Rockies in the 1920s or 30s this is not a typical western with spectacular scenery and exciting action. The silver mine at the edge of town is abandoned and all that is left are fifteen adults and a few children. Dogville is about them and Grace, the young woman who comes to their town seeking refuge from gangsters in a nearby town. It is a cautionary tale about human nature -- how these ""good people"" turn from being Grace's protector into her tormentor.Dogville opens with a high overhead shot. At first it seems you are looking at a board game then, as the camera zooms in, it becomes apparent that you are looking at a stage setting -- a minimalist set where the audience is forced to focus on the actors. Rather than acts, the work is divided into chapters like a novel; just short of three hours, it is a long novel. If one is able to enjoy this film, one must wait for human nature to change at its own slow pace.The stellar cast includes Nicole Kidman, Lauren Bacall, Paul Bettany, Blair Brown, Ben Gazzara, James Caan, Phillip Baker Hall, Stellan Skarsgård, Chloë Sevigny, and is narrated by John Hurt. All perform well. Young Miles Purinton also does an excellent job as a perverse preteen. Bettany plays Tom Edison in the pivotal role as town philosopher. It is Tom who discovers Grace and persuades the residents of Dogville to allow her to live amongst them to prove that they are able to accept her as a gift despite any obstacles that occur from themselves or outsiders.In the end fear prevents the people of Dogville from accepting the gift of Grace's love, good cheer, good sense, and willingness to perform hard labor to assist them -- fear of acceptance, commitment, and the fear of unknown consequences for aiding a woman wanted wrongly by the law. The film may be seen as an allegory for any type of discrimination and its consequences.",Dogville
221,KenToo,"Horrible, pointless, poorly conceived, gimmicky...",2,9 March 2018,"First off, let me say that the gimmick of having no set does NOT work. It is a major distraction for the audience. Some have suggested not having the setting somehow forces you to pay attention more to the characters. That is totally incorrect. Your eye and attention is naturally drawn to what you know should be there, but is not. It is only when you have a set that actually fits the story that it essentially becomes invisible to the mind, and your attention is fully on the characters. This is simply a gimmick. It in no way is intrinsic to the story, nor does it advance it in any manner. It is as if the creators wanted to scream as loud as possible, ""This is an artsy film!"" Yeah, I heard you, but it still sucks.Next, to the story. The underlying theme appears to be that people in the depression who were poor and struggling to get by were horrible, mean and untrustworthy, and all men are closet rapists, and all women are closet rape-accomplices. In fact, none of this is true. On the contrary, the poorest people are often the ones who help one another the most, because the notion ""there but for the grace of God"" is most true for them. I frankly do not believe a town like that portrayed in this movie ever existed. I do not for a second believe poverty leads to this level of inhumanity but, on the contrary, poor people generally display the highest levels of humanity, and it is the wealthy who are more likely to stray from humanistic behavior. I believe the characters are unrealistic, 2 dimensional and contrived.Ultimately, the movie gets by with big name actors, a lame set gimmick and shock value from contrived and unrealistic characters and behaviors. It evades the critical derision it deserves by hiding behind the label of an ""art"" film, so if you don't like it, you are too dumb to get it. I think I recall a story about that very phenomenon and, spoiler alert, in that story it turned out the Emperor had no clothes.",Dogville

The movie looks like it was filmed in a high-school gymnasium and indeed I have seen better performances in high school plays than in this film. All the actors stand around and stare at each other like deer in headlights waiting to deliver their next empty-headed lines at one another. There is also a ridiculous narration in this film that reminds me of something from an Ed Wood film. The movie drizzles on for almost three hours because the people who made this are so in love with the smell of their own crap that they can't bear to flush any of it down the toilet where it belongs.

I have been raised seeing a lot of plays, and my boyfriend has not been seeing them for that long. At first he wanted to change it, but he is just as much entranced by the movie. Another reviewer commented that they hardly noticed the staging after a bit and later realized that there would have been so much that they would have missed had it been presented any other way. I totally agree. It brought out the softness and tenderness, as well as emotions (or lack of emotions in some cases) in a more striking and memorable manner.It reminds me of watching Streetcar Named Desire by Tennessee Williams or Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman in that they both delved on the humanity within our souls. The narration in this helps to keep the viewer on track and guided with a great tone of voice.If someone doesn't put this on a list for classic movies/plays to see, it would be a travesty in itself. Anyone interested in staging, humanity, etc. would be in complete awe.Nicole Kidman was fantastic, as well as all the other cast members with a pleasant surprise to see Lauren Bacall in this too.",Dogville
226,Graybell,Intellectual Feast,8,3 June 2020,"This is an unusual and fascinating film, visually, plotwise, characters, and thematically. There are a couple of significant points of interest. On the one hand, this is a detailed, in-depth psychological study of how different individuals justify victimizing a person (or group of people) who happens to be vulnerable, i.e., weak and unable to protect themselves. People who object that the film is ""anti-American"" or ""misanthropic"" are missing the point. It's not trying to celebrate anyone or any group, just examine one particular aspect the human psyche. Of course there are other aspects of human psychology, but the director/writer is not trying to provide a comprehensive view, rather an in-depth study of one dimension of human behavior. The other point of interest, which is more debatable and ambiguous, is the character who is victimized. She is deliberately opaque in many respects, although there are some concrete facts given. Why does she react how she does, throughout the film and especially the ending? Her character, her choices and words, raise some interesting ethical and philosophical issues. The film is very well constructed in terms of visual style, characters, and plot, and it will keep you watching, although it is perhaps too long. Essential viewing for any fans of Lars Von Trier and his intriguing body of work.",Dogville
227,rafecomo,"A perfect, raw and detailed look at human nature",10,30 September 2014,"This movie is a masterpiece, since it really develops and studies the whole idea of the real human nature, how vulnerable he is to temptation and greed, and how easy is for him to fall into sin. As all deep and meaningful movies, it's not for everybody, since you really have to think for yourself, and it's not a movie that every 5 minutes has an action stunt, however if you are the kind of person that likes to think and reflect on humanity, you'll find this piece of art amazing.Also it questions the idea of forgiveness in a very eye opening way, I'm how should It work, and how it actually works on our society. So many subjects that this film studies, all about the humans and their spirit, and how they work with the society. It could be related to a book such as ""The Karamazov Brothers"" by Dostoievski in some way, since both of them tell a story in a daily basis sketch, with simple stories and constant characters, and yet they use this daily activities and situations to question the human kind.Apart from the deep meaning the film has, the photography of the film is great, also the fact that it is presented as a theater play, which probably has arranging for Von Tirer, and makes this film also different, to see how the characters work with the ambient and elements that are even there. As well as the acting, specially from Nicole Kidman, Paul Bettany and Patricia Clarckson is very powerful and even touching, makes your really forget for a moment that your watching a movie and gets you into this people's life's.Bottom line, if you like a film that leaves you with doubts and thoughts about deep matters, then this movie is the ideal; however if you don't like a deep script, and movies that could be seen as ""flat"" or not so ""action packed"" as others, then probably you won't find the movie as perfect as it is.",Dogville

229,jaijaijai73,"Overrated, painful, yet not totally without virtue. Good ending, at least.",5,27 November 2005,"This movie is way too long, cramped, visually unexciting, brutal, disgusting, and has some awful dialog. The filmed-play thing gets old real fast, and then you're stuck with it. The Dogme shaky-cam and lunging zoom is a very weird juxtaposition with the artificial set, and is eerily reminiscent of a bad videotaping of an amateur play. The dialog frequently sucks. Nicole Kidman stumbles through the entire movie in a drugged stupor, only apparently reviving somewhat ten minutes from the end. The whole plot, such as it is, is flatly unbelievable, as are the characters. Perhaps the single worst element is the wretched, bombastic voice-over. Why, in the name of all that is holy, is this movie presided over by a smirking English accent? I like experimental movies, I sometimes like Lars, I sometimes like Dogme 95, and I frequently enjoy cruelty, sadism and violence, but this film was just really difficult to watch. At almost three hours, it seemed a deliberate assault on every normal concept of pacing. All in all, a sadistic experience to inflict on moviegoers. But. The brief dialog at the end, along with the climactic conclusion, somehow made it almost worth it. I guess Lars felt that we needed to be physically uncomfortable and angry to really appreciate the genius that is Lars. Insufferably arrogant, indeed, like all of the main characters in the movie. I screamed ""about f$%*ing time!"" when the chapter 9 notice came on informing me that the movie was almost over (watching DVD at home, of course) but the ending was pretty satisfying, all in all. I could get into a metaphorical exposition of the ending, but I'll leave that to the adventurous viewer who actually dedicates three hours of his or her life to sitting through this thing. Suffice it to say that I found Messianic overtones.I can't say I'd recommend it, but it might be worth watching with some artsy friends in search of conversational fodder. If you're looking for something out of the ordinary, and you have a deeply masochistic streak, you might even enjoy this overblown, overrated morality play. If not, there's a peppy song and soulful photo montage at the end, perhaps inserted there at the behest of the executives, in order to keep angry patrons from torching the theater in tribute upon exiting.",Dogville
230,hedgepuppy,An amazing film that bucks convention and stabs you where it hurts,10,12 October 2005,"Lars Von Trier's film ""Dogville"" is longer than your usual fare. Yes.The situations in his films get worse two or three times when you think the film is supposed to end. Yes.The lack of sets and the allegorical Grover's Corners-like nature of the storytelling in ""Dogville"" require more suspension of disbelief than your usual movie. Yes.And all I have to say to these ""critiques"" is SO WHAT? It's a fantastic movie that has done nothing but stick with me since the last credits rolled and the DVD copyright warning label came up at the end of it. I didn't want to turn it off.**SPOILERS THROUGHOUT**What I find fascinating is that many people view the lack of sets and say to themselves ""How am I to SEE this film?"" From the people up, that's how. It's exactly what many modern movies lack, the trust that the viewer can use his/her imagination, and that the imagination can quite often be sharper than being shown everything on film. It's the cut-away of the camera when the cop's ear is sliced off in ""Reservior Dogs"" that resonates, isn't it? The viewer's ""job,"" much as he/she doesn't want to do it, is to see the choices a film-maker has made, and then try to understand WHY that choice might have been made. Several critiques listed here describe the lack of walls as a way to put everything that happens in this film, good or very bad, into the middle of the street, and see how everyone in town fails to react when it's right in front of them. My mother was abused by her mother and stepfather for many years, virtually until she married my father and got the hell out of the house, and the presence of walls did absolutely nothing to make anyone do something about it. The neighbors, the family friends, the townsfolk might as well have been in Dogville for all the good they did. That's allegory at its best. And Grace's lack of scars was all the more heart-rending, because the townspeople would never have to ""see"" the effects of the harm they caused, or have any proof that harm was done at all, which of course enabled them to continue doing it. The scars were all taken internally, bottling up until the film's conclusion.One of the things I found interesting is that Von Trier was successful in vilifying human nature in a very American setting yet making it universal in scope, removing cultural and racial circumstances from the picture. The black woman and her crippled daughter were just as callous, just as demanding, just as enslaving as their white neighbors. They live there by the good graces of the town elder, Dr. Thomas Edison, and the black mother is a cleaning lady herself, more apt than anyone to understand and empathize with the plight of the servant, and yet she's just as horrible to Kidman's character as everyone else in town. Add the time-frame of the Depression era to the picture, and you see an entire population of people in hard times, marginalized by ""society"" and a victim in one way or another, and yet so easily willing to take their hardship and thrust it at someone else: all the bile, all the hate, all the jealousy, all the violence, all the meanness.Then there's the absence of religion in the picture, which I find very interesting as well. The town preacher had left, and no one would be coming to take over the parish, leaving the townsfolk to ""moralize"" themselves. It was an excellent way to illustrate the short-comings of morality as a dogmatic instrument without putting it in the hands of Christianity alone, making the allegory, if you wish to call it that, more universal and cross-cultural.Then there's the return to focus on America's short-comings as a generous and moral nation during the closing credits, which evoke such anger and resentment from American viewers. As an American, it was hard to sit and watch the end of the film because I knew the finger of blame was shifted from a universal meditation on human nature and placed squarely in my face. But it's nonetheless fitting in its own way. America is the richest country in the world, the most powerful country in the world, and we talk about how oppressed we were by the British 200 years ago and how we somehow still represent the meek as a result. We haven't been the meek in quite some time, and it's time we admit it. We have more capability to combat poverty than any single nation, and we don't do it. Not REALLY. We are all Toms, including myself, black and white, immigrant and ""native"" (and there are statements about what has happened to the true Native Americans that can be put into this dilemma as well), seeing the problems and feeling awful about them, but not doing anything about them for fear that we will lose something, like Tom's allowance from his comparatively wealthy father. What better period to put at the end of Von Trier's sentence than that?",Dogville
231,erialc,Shedding light on the darkness of Humanity,9,9 August 2004,"A story told in nine chapters on a sound stage where chalk lines mark the buildings and streets, Lars Von Trier¡¯s ¡°Dogville¡± made up in substance for what was lacking in scenery. The unusual, minimalist set-up seemed outrageous at first, but appropriate as the narrative progresses. Don¡¯t be bugged down by the initial discomfort, your mind adjusts quicker than you think.As we first became acquainted with the heroine of the movie, a fragile and angelic woman named Grace (Nicole Kidman in her career best performance). Fleeing from a mob of killers, she enters the small town of Dogville searching for help. When the residents of Dogville agreed to look after Grace in exchange for her labor, Grace¡¯s eyes were filled with hope and her heart satiated by what she imaged to be the feeling and warmth of home. Grace was grateful, grateful to every tenant of Dogville.
Yet the joyous bliss was short-lived. Treading the steps of happy times was a looming darkness that Grace could never have foreseen. In lieu of respect and friendship, Grace¡¯s continuous residence at Dogville awarded her others¡¯ mistrusts and jealousy in return. Soon, her physical labor turned into the most demanding ones, as the town¡¯s people, one by one, turned against her in an esoteric compliance -- of the darkness of the human heart -- that her fragility and innocence could never comprehend. But for Grace, she knew now how Dogville was aptly named, as she became the subject of its exploitation. The town¡¯s people, one by one, in a web of conniving lies, took advantage of her and her body, stripping away her dignity and her pride.Now, Grace could see the unpleasant rays of the light that exposed Dogville¡¯s ugliness, that uncovered the dark secrets of the human heart, that exhumed the viciousness and cruelty buried deeply in the most innocent place of the conscious. Our humanity was explored and exposed while we witnessed Grace¡¯s discovery of the truth about Dogville. Are we all as brutal as dogs or animals? Or are we even worse than those animals in our malice and willingness to hurt one of our own? Is there no longer sympathy, gentility, or compassion? As seeds of disgust, hatred and vengeance began to flourish in Grace¡¯s heart, she gave the town the ultimate reprimand before leaving it with the thought of never returning to Dogville.",Dogville
232,hashmanis,Dogville - where humans ... and others...discover their inner beasts,9,24 October 2009,"This is one of the most interesting films I have seen in a long time. The director, Lars Von Trier, is a founding member of the DOGMA95 group, and although he breaks his rules in this film, he does manage to make a movie that is minimalistic, yet potent.Dogville is the story of Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her falling out with her father, The Big Man (James Caan) over the people of Dogville. We discover that Grace believes that the people of Dogville are inherently good. How wrong she is.The film starts out by exposing us to the inhabitants of Dogville. We are introduced to the town through the eyes and thoughts of Tom Edison (Paul Bettany), a man of ideas that does not have any. We meet the people in his town and are granted an insight into their fallibility's.Then we meet Grace. She tells us that she is running away from a very powerful man. Tom misinterprets this as to mean she is running away from a gangster. He offers to introduce Grace to the town as he believes that his town will accept her into their fold. Instead, the town concludes to give Grace a trial period and Tom induces Grace to attempt to spend time with all the inhabitants so they get to know her. She promptly agrees and sets about meeting the town folk. The town slowly come to accept Grace and at the next town meeting she is allowed to stay.Then a lawman arrives and posts a missing persons poster. The town now have their misgivings and again Tom induces Grace to help bypass this misgiving by doing work for all the inhabitants which she again does promptly. He calls it Quid Pro Quo. Again a gently peace comes over the town as they accept Grace.The lawman returns and this time posts a Wanted poster. This again disturbs the town people and Tom convinces Grace to provide more of her time and less of theirs. He tells her it is the only way the town will remain mum over her stay with them. Here the film takes a nasty turn with Grace being raped by one of the men in the town, Chuck (Stellan Skarsgard). Grace quickly becomes the doormat for the town where she works longer hours for less pay and getting abused by more and more of the men in town. Tom attempts to 'help' Grace escape but the attempt fails and he blames her for theft. The town responds by bounding Grace to a heavy weight and chain.At one point, Vera (Patrica Clarkson), the wife of Chuck, discovers that her husband has been raping Grace and takes out her rage on Grace. Grace had been saving her money buying overpriced trinkets from Ma Ginger (Lauren Bacall). She proceeds to destroy the 7 trinkets explaining that since she had taught her children about stoicism, if Grace does not cry, she will stop smashing her trinkets. But Grace can not stop and all 7 trinkets are destroyed.Finally, the Big Man comes to town. The inhabitants, including Tom are expecting a reward. But not quite the reward they get. Grace agrees with her father that she erred and the townspeople are not worthy of life. The town needs to be put out of its misery before it creates even more misery. Grace now becomes a vengeful angel. She gives the town her Quid Pro Quo. She orders Vera's seven children to be killed one by one and the killing would stop if she displays stoicism. She then personally shoots Tom Edison in the back of the head.The one living inhabitant of Dogville that survives is Moses, the dog.The film is a powerful fable about Gods, forgiveness and responsibilities. The ending is a photo montage with David Bowie's 'Young Americans' in the background.A tale about a town near you, and about people we all know.",Dogville

Most of the acting is very good, except for Cloe Sevingy who seems too modern for this part.  Unfortunately, good acting cannot save a boring story.  The story is told in chapters and when we read that the last chapter was beginning, the audience cheered that this torture would finally end.  I watched this film in a full theater and about 50 people walked out.

In some ways, this can be detrimental, and at times, I did indeed find myself disconnected from the movie.However, therein lies the redeeming value in ""Dogville."" Like a great novel, its nuances and details develop slowly and become intertwined with the underlying message within this film. This movie forces you to pay attention to the story at hand. It's sparse of scenery and locale, yet if you're willing enough, you can fill in the details if you want to. The lack of scenery forces you to focus on the characters and the slow deterioration of their human sensibilities.It's a movie that, like all brilliant movies, has themes that transcend into society as a whole.10/10",Dogville

I don't think it's a spoiler to say that most of the set pieces and buildings aren't actually present, but rather represented by chalk outlines. I felt like I was watching a Ionesco play at the Theatre de la Huchette in Paris, not a Nicole Kidman movie in America. Needless to say, I found it a bit grating. However, despite how much I disliked the ham-fisted devices (or lack thereof) in this movie, I still give it a 4 (as opposed to a 1) for the fact that it did indeed produce extremely memorable moments involving Apples, gangsters, farm trucks, and headlights.

And yes, I hated it.There's nothing wrong with the plot. Excellent actors, mind you. And the subliminal message is something to reflect upon too. The edit was fine. But the complements stop there.There's a huge lack of musics and soundtrack. And most importantly there's the lack of scenery. I had to try so hard to imagine the context of the story that I felt tired in the end, most of the time I felt disconnected and despite my effort I couldn't immerge into the story.This movie is lacking fundamental aspects that define the word movie. So in a sense it isn't a movie, it's only kind of a movie, but really, really? It's a filmed theater piece, but they forgot to format it using traditional mechanisms. If can't grasp that, try this: if this movie was a book, it would be a video with photographs of the pages, so you would have to read the book in your TV. Now imagine how fun would that be.This movie is incomplete, it's missing visual expression. In fact that is the exact reason it became famous, people say it is the result of an act of bravery that defies the standard. Well, I would agree, but that is a hoax, yes, a hoax. Whilst reading about it, I discovered it is actually a theater piece. So the poor ignorant souls who don't know this fact end up calling it a revolutionary cinema art. And right then I understood why I hated it. It's because it is not an act of bravery, but an act of deliberate laziness.It takes real talent to direct and transport a viewer using a screen to the other side of the screen. Everyone knows It is extremely hard to port stories into cinema, but this one fails miserably because it doesn't even try. This is literally, a theater peace filmed with fancy angles and it catches you with your pants down because this information is not disclosed nor advertised. Well, If I wanted to see a peace directly from the theater I would have gone to the theater, feel me? I tell you, I would have probably loved it. But on a screen it sucks!

Not because of possible spoiler (I'm doing my best not to write any), but because you should watch this movie before reading anything about it at ALL. Forget everything, and watch! My spoiler was as little as this: I read a line about this movie which contained the term ""anti-american"" in it before I saw it. That statement was already a spoiler for me, because I couldn't stop thinking about it while watching the movie and trying to figure what could be that actual a-a thing. I would rather have seen it without having known that, so I could figure it out myself. I wouldn't call it that anyway, I would rather call it an eye opener.Anyway, the movie it self is absolutely wonderful. I started the movie not knowing what I would get (except for the a-a part) and was surprised by the scene setup. Since I was expecting something really heavy and serious I didn't know what to think of it first. That just lasted a minute or so, and then the movie had already captured me... Really captured me... First it was the astonishing acting, the realness of it. Later on it was just the wonderfulness of that little world and the characteristics of the people and the community. After that it was the story which hit me hard. Sometimes I even had a hard time staying in my seat. It really got to me. The crazy part was. I haven't seen a movie in quite a while which felt so real; the stage didn't mean anything.And when it ends.. It leaves you with a lot to think about.. And I'm going to think about it, if I want it or not :) ..I just hope that no one will just draw a quick conclusion about the ending.. I don't think you can really conclude.. So many things seem right, so many things seem wrong.. from every side..I don't have to say more about it. My sincere compliments to everyone involved in creating this movie.

240,gedachtniskirche,A Nightmare On Elm Street,9,1 August 2013,"The master of deep symbolism, Lars Von Trier, never betrayed to his proprietary style. Every his work – is a thoughtful and subtle concentration of morality's ideas, principles, manifestations of human nature. Each movie of LVT can be cut out into many pieces and consider each separately, explore, analyze, discuss, learn. And you can just understand that fact, that Von Trier's movies – are grandiose cinematographic paintings, touching upon a range of philosophical questions and surveys, written in a unique style with the help of a profound acting.«Dogville» - is shockingly aesthetic product with deliberate asceticism in the narrative, with the multifaceted semantic loading and deep expressed symbolics. The Author, without false scruple, literally turns inside out the conceptions of morality, good and evil, justice and freedom. All these conceptions coexist in each of the Dogville's characters so distorted and bitty way, that those initial personality's manifestations of each not only aren't true, but, turns out, are its complete antithesis.«Dogville» makes you think about a lot of things: about the nature of good and evil, about the true purpose of sacrifice. This movie uncovers America: it's far from wonderful and carefree world, where all dreams come true, it's a world, absorbed by a Great Depression, where people have lost their ideals, and the reason for this – irrepressible lust for power. The temptation of power - is one of the leitmotifs of the film. The person, having felt even the slightest superiority over others, feeding his self-esteem, seeks to suppress all who even a little weaker than he. The director gives us food for thought every time, showing that there's a limit to everything.The ascetic minimalism in scenery is used by the director not as an original move. This is not a creative lugs. It's a deliberate art outline for this story. The absence of traditional decorations, half- empty hangar with layout on the floor instead of houses, atmosphere's theatricality only at first sight arise sensation of closed and artificial space. In fact, this is a very precise godsend, with the help of which, firstly, director presents the story as a parable, demonstrating the story as an example only one of the many abstract fantastic stories. Secondly, this method perfectly reveals structure of the city, where everyone's life passes in full view of others and, it would seem, it's impossible to hide anything. It just and awfully! Everyone knows the secrets of each of the neighbors, everybody see everything, that is happening in every family, and all they are strikingly similar to each other. And, thirdly, the absence of a familiar scenery does not distract the audience's attention from the main thing, and vice versa, concentrates it on every detail, that is a very important part of the whole plot twists.This movie is about the animal essence, that civilized man so thoroughly suppresses in himself. Dogvillers irradiate warmth and integrity. Their hospitality is towardly, because good will save the world. But the masks come off, and we see the true guise of these compassionate and friendly townsfolk. This is a bunch of hungry dogs, who are patiently waiting when somebody will throw a fresh bone to them. But the main question is put as the curtain fell of the picture. The owner showed up, and the victim, putting upon and tormented for months, finally found her freedom and unlimited power. This victim was full of nobility and forgiveness for a long time. She endured all the torments in the name of good, her ideals were unshakable. Her altruism bordered on egoism. And Grace understood that she was not all forgiving the savior, but the same person, thirsting for revenge, allowing to take shape of her desire to destroy all this miserable town of bottlers and nonentities. And she makes her revenge, reveling in the newly acquired power. She kept alive only a dog, being convinced, how mean and lightweight person in comparison with animals. But who is she now? The same animal. «Dogville» - it's not just a story, happening with a particular person, this is a movie of each of us, about behavior's psychology, about unfoldment of our true identity. This is a film about human cruelty and hatred. And how we can fight it, not to be tied to the chariot of our emotions and preserving human form, humbly accepting injustice and aggression from the side of others, no answer evil for evil. And the ending of the movie, just demonstrate to us the most primitive, almost animal way of resolving the problem. But, unfortunately, many of us elect it as an equitable and only right one. And each of us will independently choose the answer, of course, to very difficult question, which Lars Von Trier raise before us.",Dogville

This ""helping"" grows in intensity to the point of slavery as the town becomes increasingly dependent on her and she is scared to leave fearing what brought her to Dogville in the first place. Ultimately the situation is resolved. As for the film itself, one would have to believe that the director made this movie in order to cause a reaction. It's almost as if he is saying, ""I don't care if you love it or hate it, I just want you to feel something"". It this vein, I believe he accomplished his goal. There are aspects of this film that I loved and hated, sometimes simultaneously. For one, the movie is a full three hours long. That's a big commitment for one sitting. Secondly, the dialogue is choppy and sometimes confusing. It's as though it was written first in Danish and then translated into English. Sometimes this works, sometimes it falls flat.

243,CairaP,Theatre and cinema together to create an amazing movie,9,24 February 2009,"I haven't seen something so nice for long time, shame on me I just saw this movie. The story is divided in nine chapters and takes place on a stage with minimalist scenery, with chalk marks to indicate walls, streets and even a dog drawn on the floor. It seems to be at the theatre but sitting on the stage, you can feel the actors' breathes. The story narrated by Lars Von Trier is so terrible and so true about human behaviour, about our weakness and contradictions. He succeeded again. The main character is performed by Nicole Kidman and she is perfect for that role, cold but sweet, mysterious but deep at the same time. Grace comes to Dogville while running away from gangsters, the entire community of fifteen people is aware of it and decides to give her the chance to stay there if she proves to be a trustful person. Then starts the weakness of the human nature, power turns people into jackals. Each character, stereotype of a small town character, threaten her to exploit her more and more, worse and worse. The town turns into a prison and she tries to run away from it, being disappointed and humiliated again. A political-religious allegory remains under wraps for most of the film but it comes out in the closing credits in a juxtaposition of David Bowie's Young Americans accompanied by a montage of photographic images. By the end, the victim takes the power and use it against everyone, forgets her rules and ethic to punish. You feel it's right, you feel redeemed, relieved, you want to take the power and punish.

Which is pretty unusual for my standards because I walked out of dozens of films. I thought it was utter madness but on the other hand you have different fingers. that's how mad the movie was. In my opinion you're never to old to learn something stupid but for this I'm way to old. And I can't get the movie out of my mind. It's like eating old french cheese, the bad taste lasts for about a year. That's the sensation i get with this lousy excuse for a movie. If it was live theater I would have been trowing beer at the actors and if there was a farm nearby probably also a few rotten tomatoes or eggs. In my opinion 'dogville' deserves a place in the bottom 100 list, somewhere between disaster movie and Simon Sez. But that's just my opinion. And you know what they say about opinions, they're like cornholios...everybody's got one and they're often full of droppings.",Dogville
245,paberry-1,Everyone Loves a Trier,7,29 March 2004,"Sometimes you walk out of an epic thinking this film must be a work of genius or I have just wasted the last three hours. Breaking the Waves was a waste of three hours. Dancer in the dark was incredible. The jury is still out on Dogville. The film is in many ways ingenious and original but the plot, particularly the ending, seemed a little thin. The most ingenious part is the way you a worn down by the reasonableness of the townspeople.
Spoilers follow: the initial rape was shocking and horrific, the second was was sad and pathetic but the gradual degradation of Grace becomes almost as reasonable to the viewer as it does to the townspeople, even though you want to be repulsed. The ending was particularly perverse with the audience laughing despite having just witnessed a particularly gruesome twist in the plot.How could ""civilized"" Europeans and Americans justify slavery? How could ordinary Germans stand by and watch the degradation of their neighbors? How could some Serbs defend the actions of their ethnic cousins in Srebrenica? How could educated Romans defend the butchery of the Gladitorial games? Perhaps this film gives us a few clues.Kidman was brillant and it was great to see Gazzara and Bacall but the real star of the show was John Hurt. Only 7/10 for being an hour too long.",Dogville
246,gryspnik,A masterpiece,10,4 April 2004,"The word masterpiece is overused especially during the past 10 years. I personally rarely use it and this one definitely deserves it. I have read critics characterizing this movie as uncomprehensible, too long, anti-american, non realistic, hard to believe, nihilistic etc. Well, it seems that these people have never heard of the words allegoric, ironic, parable, theatrical, symbolic etc. Everything, from the symbolisms contained in every centimeter of the setting and the words of the characters, to the acting and camera motion are really splendid. The analysis of the ""human"" nature (or should I say the modern society's imposed nature?) is very deep and clear. Good people are despised for being better than others; people are prone to mob-like behaviour; ethics are irrelevant when you possess power over someone; power will always be abused if given the opportunity to excersise it; stoicism is a virtue unknown to modern humans; vengeance is way easier than forgiveness; human weakness is certainly an explanation but never an excuse for any pain the inflict upon others and so many other things. For those who find anti-american elements in the movie is clearly because they recognise that the behaviours stated above are met more in this country were individualism and masses-like behaviour as well as revenge is a way of life. That is what I saw in the movie and a lot more. I never thought that I would say this but things change: Dogville is the best movie I have ever seen. Enjoy..P.S. The Dictum ac Factum  inscribed in the entrance of the mine means ""no sooner said than done"" but I still haven't made any connection with the scenario presented.",Dogville
247,tkubas1,I thought it was original.,7,13 March 2014,"The calm before the storm is how I describe the first hour of Dogville. It's a steady build of unease and worry. At first it had me wondering why it was rated R, but not for long. A creeping dread overtakes you and won't let up until the intense final act.The first thing that needs to be mentioned when talking about this film is the play style format. At first I was very confused. The set is just a big stage with chalk lines on it. There are no locations. It's a small city condensed to an even smaller size. For the first hour it can be very distracting. The characters open invisible doors and talk about nonexistent objects. There are only props and partial pieces of things to give the audience something to imagine. The directorial style instantly made me think I was sitting an auditorium watching from the crowd. I had honestly never seen a movie like it. I over all had mixed feeling towards everything. On one hand I'm amazed by the overhead shots of the whole town. I can see everything everyone is doing all at the time, and it looks so good. On the other hand I'm kind of scoffing at how ridiculous some of the other things look. Someone got mad at someone else for not walking around a chalk drawing of a bush, and sound effects coming from nothing are just some of the weird things that happen. I think that once you get used to the style it can add something to the movie. For example, I like how you can see almost everything that is going on in the town at once. You can see people talking amongst themselves in their own homes as other characters talk outside. I think the viewer gets more information about the emotions and mood of the town this way. Without it, it would be a different movie. Would it have been better shot in a more traditional style? Possibly, but I think this style is something unique that no other movie has. I wouldn't want to watch this style all the time, but I think in this film it was a success.Part of the reason the stage play aspect works is because the acting is so good. I may not have believed they were in a town the whole time, but the characters did. Nicole Kidman gave the best performance from her I've seen. It was subtle and quiet. I was cheering for her character even in her most morally ambiguous moments. The supporting actors all did stellar work as well. They all were completely believable in their creepy small town ways. Even the child actors sent a chill down my spine! Over all I liked the movie. It was often hard for me to enjoy what was happening. I would say if you watch movies for the technical aspects, you care about acting, and you watch for filmmaking techniques you will love it. If you only watch to have some fun or to have a good time you will be somewhat confused and probably not like it. All in all I thought it was a good original movie and I'm glad I watched it.",Dogville
248,vincent-100,Can't get it out of my head,9,31 January 2005,"I knew not what to expect, and only knew that Kidman was in it. It even sounded a bit boring, but I was bored so I got it on video. Wow! I loved the idea of the set, and I recognised some other actors so I settled down to watch. Initially I thought Grace was dangerous and was going to hurt the people of Dogville. I actually felt protective over them at first. But when nothing happened, and she just wanted to fit in, I hoped they would just keep her. The acting was good, the story OK, and I was thinking of giving it a 7 just for style. Then I crossed the halfway mark.There were moments when I wanted to switch it off in disgust, but something kept me watching until the end. And I'm glad I did because this movie has one of the best endings I've ever seen. It's not an 'Others' or 'Sixth Sense' kind of ending that surprises you and gives you a fleeting moment of gratification. Rather, it's a slower satisfaction with deep roots in that conflict between a righteous yet immoral retribution.This is not a movie I will ever watch again. It's too disturbing, like Once Were Warriors, or Passion. But its brilliance cannot be denied. I can't get it out of my head.",Dogville

The stunning performance by Nicole Kidman is not the only reason to watch that movie.

The see - through scenery, the moral discussion, lusting human nature - everything finds it's right place in this top - of - the - art movie. Because watching the final forty - five minutes of film with my eyes, mouth and ear wide open is not something that would happen to me every day. And that's why there's no use writing a balanced critic of this movie - this is the movie you just gotta see!10 stars, no doubt.",Dogville
250,bazibazbaz,Welcome to America!,10,10 January 2005,"The race riots of the early 90's startled the majority of Americans. Why should citizens of such a great democracy want to destroy it? However, what I personally found surprising about the whole situation was the aftermath of the violence, and how nearly all the commentators failed to realize that implicit racism was at the heart of the problem, and while the American Dream may be open to some, to most it will remain just that, a dream. Put simply, if you marginalize and exploit a minority, should you be surprised if it begins to feel disenfranchised, and acts accordingly? The narrative style of Dogville is like a storybook, with dry observations from the commentator. It's very reminiscent of Animal Farm too. What Orwell did for the USSR, Von Trier does for the USA. But whereas Animal Farm is all about the exploitation of the worker, Dogville is about the exploitation of the minorities that make up the underclass in America. Which, of course, is what Grace (Nicole Kidman)and her increasing oppression at the hands of the Americans represents. As a political allegory, you can't pay Dogville any higher compliment than a comparison with Orwell. Although Orwell was primarily a political writer, you never feel you are being preached to in his novels. And you get the same feeling with Dogville too. It's only with the 'subtle change in light' when Grace finally sees what a rotten place Dogville is and allows her Godlike father(James Caan)to act accordingly.It's interesting that it takes a Scandinavian to see America for what it has been, and to some extent, still is. Perhaps this film is the powerful wake up call America needs. Perhaps the next time there's a 'subtle change in light' there will be a similar change in political thinking and institutions. And the use of Bowie's Young Americans in the closing titles, to pictures of the oppressed through America's recent history, clarifies the point that no matter how bad things are, even during the Great Depression, there is no excuse for exploitation. This film should be compulsory viewing for schoolchildren everywhere.",Dogville
251,mark-658-485258,Again Lars Von Trier rolls out a masterpiece...,10,14 April 2013,"Dogville was filmed in a studio with a set that most of the time looks like the players are standing on a school blackboard with definition lines in chalk. Although this film is set in a small town in America it could have been any town, anywhere in the world; as I believe that the emphasis is on the dark side of human nature and not any form of critique on the American 'way-of-life'.On the run from a group of gangsters, Grace (Nicole Kidman) arrives in the small mining town, the townsfolk take her in and make a deal with her; if she will work for them for nothing, they will offer her sanctuary. Grace agrees to the terms and meets the locals; however their demands are ever increasing...Lauren Bacall and the rest of the cast give good performances but Nicole Kidman excels herself, in this, what I believe to be one of her best. The narration by John Hurt is captivating.A must see for Art House and Lars Von Trier fans, or like me; just lecherously watching the svelte Nicole Kidman swan about the screen...",Dogville

After having watched the movie, especially the last scene, I was deeply impressed and it let me thinking for quite some time. Each scene fits to real life human relations, everything fits just perfectly. It is about dependence, about how it comes to exploitation. It fits to everything, it explains antisemitism etc. It reminds me on Berthold Brecht's works. I cannot understand why American wannabe patriots hated it, why it was called 'communist' or 'anti-american'. USA was taken only as an example. That is what real cinema is for, to affect thoughts, to explain human behavior, not only for cheap entertainment. I hope that there'll be more big parables or fables like this. Two thumbs up.",Dogville
254,drclark,"Technically Brilliant, but a morally repugnant and vicious story",1,13 September 2003,"Lars Von Trier has attempted to create an new version of Bertolt Brecht's DER GUTE MENSCH VON SEZUAN (Good person/woman of Szechwan) centered on a different moral compass.  While Brecht was focused on the corrupting nature of capitalism, von Trier focuses on the corrupting notion of being American.The is a lot to be honestly critical of in the United States, arrogance, ignorance and indifference among them.  Traditionally critical works have focused on the institutions - corporations, criminals, government etc.  This movie argues that the American people themselves are fundamentally rotten.Every character in this movie is a liar, rapist and/or thief.  The one pure character learns from her experiences with these people by closing off her humanity and becoming a mafia kingpin.On all accounts this should be a brilliant movie - technically inspiring, amazing performances from a compelling cast.  The writing is excellent. What undermines the film is this disgusting vile story that does not offer constructive criticism or moral parable, but only anger and disgust.  This film is a direct attack on the character at the centre of the American society - small town America.There is no good in von Trier's America.  There is no hope.  There is no joy.  Do not watch this film, there is nothing to be gained.",Dogville
255,Andrew499,The World Is A Stage,9,13 January 2004,"What Von Trier does better than anybody at the moment is to make you believe what you shouldn't believe in.  Be it a musical or a protagonist that looks right at the camera, he creates the truth within untrue circumstances. Here, he makes us believe in a community when all we see is a black stage and chalklines.  And the way he does all this is through his supremely structured narrative.  Ten minutes into the film, you forget there are no walls, no buildings, no horizons.  You believe in the people and you see what is not there.  Kidman delivers another flawless performance as the girl on the run.  But it is Von Trier who deserves the praise for taking Cinema into the 21st century like no other.",Dogville
256,J_7,exploration of character development and actor choices,9,31 August 2004,"It was a well done movie with every inclusive minute as important as the next. Each chapter displayed character breakdown and motivations so that each town member transfers from the two dimensional world of naivety and innocence to the three dimensional world of human dynamics which include greed, lust, anger, rape, and violence. These character developments work for and against Grace, the main character, for the absolutely surprising and phenomenal ending. Lars Von Trier instigates the idea in this movie that natural tendencies of human beings do not preclude forgiveness. I think that the set of this movie brings forth these character studies as it is so aesthetically limited. Of course, the story is as well acted as it is written. One might not suspect at first that Nicole Kidman is the best choice for this role but her subtlety and beautifully innocent face and form provide exactly what the character ""Grace"" implies. It proves, once again, that her more indie-type explorations in film are satisfying. Her beauty does not absolutely limit her acting capabilities. And for a first time ""American"" accent, Paul Bettany does very well. Throughout the entirety of this film, one could hardly suspect his European (or United Kingdom) background. This is not a movie for people who do not wish to spend time contemplating or analyzing a movie. This piece of film making would fall victim to severe criticism if it wasn't viewed in this fashion.",Dogville
257,domadilla,"The human soul bares its teeth and exclaims, ""woof woof""!",9,16 May 2005,"WOW what an amazing film...I've just finished watching Dogville for the first time. I have to say that is the most shocking film I have seen in my lifetime. Considering I watched 'Oldboy' merely a week ago that is saying A lot. This film wasn't graphically gut-wrenching, but it's the actions of the characters and the finale of the film that really made me think.The film is shot entirely on one 'stage' and has sporadic narration. Some people may find this theatre-like atmosphere off-putting, but I think this is an ingenious, not to mention unique, idea. The point of having the whole film shot on this one stage is that it helps to illustrate how close-knit a community Dogville is. There are no walls on the set only props, it's as if the film is baring its heart and soul (the characters) to the audience. All i can say is patience is a virtue, so if you can sit through the first few scenes and get used to this 'universal stage' idea the story will soon engulf you and compulsion to watch the whole 9 chapters is certain (not sure if there is a relevance in the number 9).The basic plot (no spoilers): Tom is an aspiring intellectual/philosopher, he daydreams about morales and the ideals of right and wrong one day hoping write a successful paper on this. He is fed up with the narrow-minded people of Dogville, accusing them of non-acceptance in regards to outsiders and the world in general. When Nicole Kidman's character Grace stumbles upon Dogville by chance, Tom sees this as an opportunity to test the town's people. Grace takes up residence in Dogville and the story takes flight....The cast is absolutely superb, Nicole Kidman puts in a first-rate performance. I think all the actors and actresses really got to grips with their roles and this makes the film all the more special. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a gripping, meaningful story as well as a shock or two. This film is simply enthralling. 9/10 from me.",Dogville

259,Pavel-8-2,I finally finished the movie!,7,23 January 2005,"Many months ago I told this forum that I had walked out of the theater 20 minutes into Dogville. I failed to be entertained by a filmed stage play that seemed to subject us to the same smug, dull, vague preaching given the townspeople by young Tom Edison. As I promised, I rented the DVD, given the opportunity to while away hours while my wife is studying in Thailand. I am happy to reassure angry Euros that this originally disappointed American enjoyed the way the film picked up once Grace began to interact with the townspeople. Although I anticipated displeasure at the advertised mistreatment of Nicole Kidman's character, the lingering photography of her in better moments made up for rage at Tom's impotent courtship and at the other townsmen's abuse. The moment that sticks with me is the climatic conversation in the car between Kidman and Caan regarding judgment and standards. Do I hold others to the standards of behavior to which I hold myself? If not, why not? What does it say about me if I don't? And what does it say that Von Trier's denouement is so satisfying to most of us?",Dogville
260,CPAScott,Sheer dogma,3,12 April 2004,"By dogmatic, I mean the second definition described in the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: ""Characterized by an authoritative, arrogant assertion of unproved or unprovable principles.""von Trier, might take no offense, asserting that this is his opinion, but given that Mr. von Trier has never set foot in the United States and yet so overt in his condemnation of it, I see no other characterization more appropriate to this film and its maker.David Edelstein's review on Slate.com perhaps summarizes my own feelings more that any other review.  I particularly like the last penultimate paragraph of his work:""Von Trier really gives us Yanks the big middle finger in the credit sequence, which presents photos of real American poverty, hopelessness, and desperation while David Bowie warbles the acidic ""Young Americans."" That was when I gave the movie the finger right back; I wanted to throw things at the screen. I'm sure Lars von Trier would regard me the way Col. Jessup regards the lieutenant in A Few Good Men-I can't handle the truth. But it's more like I can't handle selective half-truths by a preening, misanthropic bully who wouldn't recognize an act of decency if it bit him on the ass.""Admittedly, the film-making style of this film was fantastic, and I applaud Von Trier for it.  I also give him credit for having the willingness to put forth such a film despite any potential outcry or backlash that might occur. However, my praise of Dogville -- and of von Trier -- stops there.  The movie was overly long and would have been better presented were it 15-20 minutes shorter.Leaving us wondering if this was a statement about America, western values, or humanity in general would have invoke thoughtful discussion across the world, but VonTrier makes it quite clear in the end credits where his hositility is directed.That by itself does not bother me, but what does is the suggestion -- perhaps overtly -- in the film that the world would be a better place without Dogville (aka America).  Such direct hostility is nothing more than ignorant, bigoted, and counterproductive to human growth.  The only real statement VonTrier makes with Dogville is that VonTrier himself is a dogmatist.",Dogville
261,nienhuis,A Commentary on American Slavery?,10,12 March 2004,"You can add me to the list of people who find DOGVILLE an extremely powerful movie. I have just seen it at the Florida Film Festival in Orlando, Florida, where some people seem to have hated the film but where I found it to be one of the most important films I have ever seen. Why do I consider it important? Because I think it deals with very large and crucial ideas for our extremely troubled times. If it is true that von Trier is examining America in his latest films, I believe that he is serving a very important function in our country's awareness of itself. It seems to me that DANCER IN THE DARK finally metamorphoses into an indictment of capital punishment, an institution that some might say has no place in a highly civilized society. What does DOGVILLE seem to be about? I think it might be von Trier's attack on the history of American slavery. I don't know if what follows should be considered a spoiler, but, to be safe, I should warn that I am about to outline what I think the ending of the film is about. It is clear from the beginning of the film that von Trier has American issues in mind, not only because he sets the film in America but because he mimics Thornton Wilder's OUR TOWN, a classic text of literary Americana. Grace arrives in Dogville mysteriously and her father, at first, appears to be a villain, and the town, at first, appears to be her savior. But after Grace survives initially by giving the townspeople her labor, she becomes increasingly exploited until she is literally put in chains. The progression of Grace's exploitation in the town and the film's use of chain imagery is too striking to be an insignificant detail in the film. Grace's docility under this enslavement is only broken by her father, who turns out to be not a villain but a liberator, a brutally honest man who helps her see her captors more clearly. Grace comes finally to see herself not as a noble martyr but as a cleansing agent who will bring hard justice to an arrogant community. She spares the dog, who is not a rational animal, because it cannot be blamed for simply following its natural instincts. The townspeople have no such excuse. As creatures capable of rationality, the citizens of DOGVILLE have a responsibility to lead rational lives. Thus, DOGVILLE is a wake up call for a nation that often fails to see itself honestly. For hundreds of years, America violated its own Constitutional principles by refusing to recognize the humanity of its dark-skinned people. Now, in its continued arrogance, America  generally sees slavery as an irrelevant problem of the past and considers affirmative action a new kind of injustice. For centuries, America refused to recognize the equality of women and now blithely considers sexism a dead issue. But as we enter a new century, America is once again refusing to recognize the basic human rights of a large portion of its citizens, its gay people, and once again this blindness is perpetrated in the name of tortured logic and tawdry Christian principles. America needs effective gadflies, even if they turn out to be Danish.",Dogville

It also features a brilliant, thought-provoking storyline made possible through some of the finest performances from some of the premiere actors and actresses working. Set aside any controversy you may have heard about director Lars von Trier's alleged anti-American undertones. Also, be prepared for the long haul- the movie runs close to three hours.

Echoes of Brecht and his circle of chalk overshadow this black tale of exploitation, naivety and cold-hearted revenge. The most striking postmodernist film ever made, already famous for its sarcastic take on the american dream (which is not so accurate-the film had a much broader vision)has been deprived of its chances to artistic recognition, first at Cannes film festival and now by postponing its American release until next year.

265,adamcfreeman,Picture of a small North American town.,9,21 June 2010,"I have been trying for several years to find something that eclipses this film in honesty, wit, intelligence, drama, and tragedy. To date, nothing really quite achieves the kind of ethical brutality that Dogville does.Having spent much of my life in rural North Dakota, I feel that I'm qualified to state that this film accurately describes life in a small North American town. These are places where passive-aggression is a way of life. This community functions because everyone knows the weaknesses of everyone else, but no one says anything for fear of being damaged themselves. In a place like this, the only power one can have over another is information (read: dirt). This power can only be exercised through proverbial blackmail, something that passive-aggression thrives upon.When a stranger enters this community, they become the focal point of the entire community's passive-rage. In an attempt to appease this rage, the newcomer (Grace, an appropriate name) volunteers all of her weaknesses to the town in exchange for safety. Rightfully, the town asks for some sort of compensation, and Grace becomes a sort of public servant. At this point, everything appears to be going well. As the case with anything ""public"", everyone wants more than anyone else, and the tug of war begins.With the mention of ""each giving according to their ability"" regarding Grace's payment (does anyone remember Atlas Shrugged?), the story becomes the prelude to something very sinister. From there, it doesn't get better.It is not my intent offer a complete explication of this cinematic wonder, merely to give a gentle nudge in one of the directions that the story goes. If you like this film, a nice companion to follow it is Manderlay (which is somewhat close to a sequel).",Dogville

Although, this message is illustrated by a very well done, innovating piece of cinematography. I have a hard time understanding why is it such a fashion to make movies that only show the dark side of the human spirit, its general (if not universal) lack of morality, its bitterness? Confronting this so called reality - a dark, obscure, absurd, evil, cruel, meaningless, selfish, monstrous world - gets you closer to the truth?Maybe, for some people, getting in touch with the horrible aspects of the human kind, can provoke a reversed reaction, by making them feel more noble, or less repulsive.

It wants to make you believe that the voice-over's point of view (which I would assume is the director's) is an objective analysis what happens.The way it switches the characters from reasonable people to monsters is nothing short of ridiculous, especially the graceful Grace.All in all I really enjoyed the first half, the way the decor (or lack thereof) enhanced the storytelling, the way the movie was set up as a play. I wish I would have saved myself one and a half hour by not watching the second half.

268,gobbles_the_penguin,Is it a good movie?,10,28 October 2005,"Whenever i tell people about 'Dogville', they always ask me whether it is a good movie or not. That is a question that cannot be answered, and that is exactly what von Trier intended. You can't rate Dogville with an amount of stars and whatnot, Dogville just....'is'. I'm not going to tell you too much about the plot, but i will tell you some of the underlying things about the movie. von Trier uses a big black sound stage with chalk outlines for houses. This is not to save money, but it is a Brechtian technique of isolation. Accompanied by the seemingly 'shoddy' editing, von Trier doesn't want the viewer to be sucked into the filmic fantasy side of the movie, he wants you to understand the point he is making, and is almost slapping the viewer on the head every time they don't concentrate. This is effective, because Dogville is far more than a sad tale about Grace getting picked on, it's about how when people receive power and authority, how they take advantage of other people in a less fortunate position, therefore directly taking a stab at capitalism in general. There are also many religious parallels in Dogville, some may say that Grace is the parallel of the kind and merciful Jesus Christ. Finally, many people believe that Dogville is strongly anti-American, i can say that it is not, because von Trier seems to show a much deeper anger at the whole of mankind. How? You'll have to see for yourself! This is one of the bravest, and best movies i have ever seen, and i look forward to the rest of von Trier's movies!",Dogville
269,SyMaster20,30 Minutes into it: Possibly Worst Film Ever,1,22 November 2006,"Unless something drastic and miraculous happens this has to be a candidate for worst movie ever. I am essentially vaguely familiar with the Dogme 95 ""movement."" I have seen ""Julien Donkey Boy,"" that was by no means a good movie but it destroys this waste of film stock viciously. I read a spoiler saying Nicole Kidman gets spanked and raped which could dramatically help a truly hideous beginning. What the hell is the ""film?"" The town is a stage, the people live in chairs, and some gangsters just roll through looking to massacre Nicole. What the hell is she even doing in this film? And Paul Bettany, Ivanek from OZ, and other very good actors such as Lauren Bacall. In conclusion, Dogme is garbage and this is a perfect example of why that is the truth.",Dogville

She and I both wanted to walk out long before it ended but we thought the other was enjoying it.  Don't bother if you don't like movies without scenery.  It was a purely actors film, not aesthetically pleasing whatsoever, IMHO. There were some good actors in it, like Nicole Kidman, Paul Bettany and Patricia Clarkson but they could not redeem the movie in my opinion.  The only character I really enjoyed was James Caan as Kidman's mafia-like father.  A total waste of time and money!I certainly wouldn't rent this on DVD either unless again you are curious about this ""dog"" of a movie.",Dogville

I was excited when it began and I saw where he was going, but the heavy-handedness killed it for me. Everything was explained to death, in exact contrast to the minimalist approach, and the irony of the critique of arrogance through over-explanation of points that were clear...well maybe it's just the result of English as a second language.On the whole, I got it, but I could have gotten it with a far less heavy handed and clunky approach.

273,hareck,bloody well directed but utterly depressive and confusing,8,25 April 2004,"No doubt that L. v. Trier is a directing genius, he knows how to pull an audience into a movie, his way to set up the stage with only outlines of the buildings and streets of Dogville is highly innovative and effective. The performance of every one of the actors is top notch as well. BUT....I am really happy that I do not share Trier's philosophy, which seems to be: leave a group of pretty people somewhat isolated from society and justice and they will automatically turn into stupid beasts, every single one of them. Perfect direction and acting actually makes this message more intense and therefore even harder to bear.SPOILER ahead. At best this movie could have been a good tragedy, but it isn't, because it fails to offer a real catharsis, instead we get a fake one. The decision of Grace to kill all the villagers in the end is the weakest part of the plot and only adds to the impression that the director just wants to slam his negative outlook into the faces of the audience.10/10 for acting and sheer technical brilliance, 1/10 for poor, unreflected cynicism.",Dogville
274,swmayer,Dogville: A Different Sort of Hospitality,7,8 April 2007,"This movie starts slow and stays that way. It has a long run-time, limited musical accompaniments, a single, static set and a dark melancholy plot line. That said, if one is patient enough (or just interested enough in John Hurt's magnificent narration) there is a gem to be found here.Nicole Kidman plays the role of Grace, a young woman who wanders into the town of Dogville after a series of gunshots had echoed in the distance. There she encounters a different sort of small-town hospitality. After a two-week probationary period the town agrees to shelter her from the law and from the gangsters she had been running away from.The set for the film consists of very little. Many of the items are no more than labeled chalk outlines, described in greater detail by the story's narrator. No walls stand around the houses, allowing the viewer to see the entirety of the characters' lives much the way they would in a novel where the narrator is omniscient. The openness of the town aids in relating the progression of the view of the characters from merely suspicious small town folk, into truly despicable human beings who are more than willing to take advantage of a person to the point of blackmailing her into becoming a slave to be chained and raped. Perhaps the best example is provided in the foreshadowing statement made by the character of Chuck (Stellan Skarsgård ) who said: ""I've found out that people are the same all over. Greedy as animals. In a small town they're just a bit less successful. Feed 'em enough, they'll eat till their bellies burst."" Paul Bettany's character of Thomas Edison is only one who seems to be on the fence of love for Grace and his own self-perseveration. Ironically, and painfully for Tom, Grace is had by all the men of the community save he, who she assures she loves. This sexual frustration only adds to his already strong feelings of inadequacy that he has developed in his failings a writer. Eventually he calls the gangsters and has Grace locked in her room, hoping to profit from the endeavor and leave the painful problem of Grace in his past. When the gang arrives and it discovered that the leader (played by James Caan) is actually her father, Grace has a decision to make: Does she forgive the flaws of the people of Dogville, or does she punish them for the terrible crimes they have committed?The film masterfully builds tension ever so slowly, but its real strength is in the depth of the characters who the viewer can sympathize with in one moment and despise the next. These contradictions make the Grace's final decision all the more real.",Dogville
275,stratosl,Put off by the scenery...,8,12 December 2003,This movie is great and surely remarkable food for thought but I was put off by the theatrical scenery...I'm sure that it would have managed to cause a much greater effect in a realistic world rather than chalked walls and invisible doors...I would have graded it with a 9 or 10 but now I suppose it deserves an 8/10.,Dogville
276,OrrinBob,Very fine film with impact.,9,23 August 2013,"Well, 10 is merely excellent? If I ignore that anchor and say 10 is tiptop, I'd give this film about an 8.5. In terms of execution (no pun intended), the film is excellent throughout--the set, acting, shots, narration, etc. are obtrusively controlled and thought-provoking. I've read about 50 other reviews, and none yet has mentioned 'Our Town', which this film seems to aim to mock, or Durrenmatt's 'The Visit', which is about revenge from the very beginning, but still about the corrosive effect on every member of a community an outsider can have.Grace (Nicole Kidman), and the town's treatment of her, call to mind Christ for sure, but even moreso slavery as an institution, so that the black actress's complicity in Grace's abuse is strikingly ironic. A key message of the film, as I viewed it, is that Grace's very goodness, and early unopposed evil acts, partly the cause of the town's corruption. The townsfolk seem to get along OK before Grace arrives; the other attractive young woman in town does not get raped, etc. (as far as we know). But Grace is helpful, sympathetic, good-spirited, uncomplaining--and so she gets exploited and then brutalized. Chuck, the apple farmer, talks about how she empathically 'understands about the apples' and so is ripe (not intended) for his rape of her. And then, if one person exploits her, the others come to believe that they are justified in doing so, too. If this is von Trier's point, it would come through more clearly if a stranger who was NOT a dazzling beauty entered the town with the same results. She's also downright inhuman in never standing up for herself or effectively protecting herself. Is a reference to the Holocaust intended?--an interesting question in the light of von Trier's comments about Hitler.Although she is unfailingly good throughout, Grace's likeness to Christ is clearest at the end, when her Father explains that her mercy and forgiveness are arrogance--failure to use the same standards to judge others that she uses to judge herself. Jehovah and the Flood? Anyway, her reaction is very interesting, as she is first reluctant to have all the villagers killed, then reasons that if they were not punished/ massacred, they would treat the next stranger to visit the same way--a rationale that is unmasked by her decision to torment one woman especially nastily and vengefully and to kill her betraying 'boyfriend' Tom herself--""One simply must do some things oneself."" (That's the gist.) My reaction to the film's conclusion was high suspense about whether she would 'do the right thing' and kill them all off, and I cheered when she did (though she did not treat Chuck nearly harshly enough for my taste). But then: has power corrupted her, too, and is that what she was fleeing, and is von Trier's conclusion that no one--not Christ, not God--can be good in this world?",Dogville
277,PeterisKrisjanis,Honesty,10,4 January 2004,"I can agree with all positive comments here so I won't repeat what others have said. Personally me mostly what stroke was that this movie is very honest and objective - it doesn't judge, it doesn't justify. And oh, no, it's not about only Americans, most frightening thing that it's really about us - our society, about humans, about our nature and what we do and don't do to protect our small, tiny human being inside ourselves.I must agree it's frighteningly real - so real that in first minutes of last scene I wanted to run and hide.I can give my though on this - as society we aren't doomed, as only as we will continue question ourselves. As Grace said, 'There's no sin of doubting yourself'.This movie changed me already. Fon Treer is one of the directors and artists who simply will push you to think. Either or other way. And thinking people is what we desperately need today.",Dogville
278,gaiderdraco,"One of the worst films of all time, or just of 2003? (SPOILERS)",1,6 March 2005,"Lars Von Trier is ""known"" to be an anti-American. I am not judging the film by the personal likes and dislikes of the director but simply by what I saw, interpreted, and thought of, after seeing the film.Dogville is filmed with, what appears to be, a MiniDV camcorder (the worst in the market) and instantly flashes the idea that Lars Von Trier did not want to take the film seriously; professionally.Dogville stars Nicole Kidman, in a rather gutsy performance, and places her as a woman named Grace who is chased by gangsters into a small mining village. The village is called Dogville; no doubt named by a Native American. Dogville is quiet and contains average and everyday people who own separate businesses and have never in their lives seen action before. They all eventually decide to take Grace under their warm wing and to get her to become one of them, so that they could like her and want her to stay (indefinitely) beyond her 2-week probation period. Things eventually turn sour, due to a few male residents of Dogville and Grace is accused of everything: beating children (that asked and blackmailed her into beating them), and having infidelities with some of the husbands in Dogville. The village-folk fasten a chain around Grace's neck, rape her every day, break the porcelain figurines she worked months to be able to afford and purchase, and contemplate even worse prospects for her.I will leave the last half hour (of the three hour ""saga"") to your imaginations and curiosities.How can such lovely and quiet people actually think of such things? And if Grace is a gangster's woman/daughter, why does she not (simply) open her mouth and let everybody know of the truth?Human emotions are, apparently, present in this monstrosity of a film and not a single ""actual"" human thought is being presented.This movie is a mockery of film-making and an insult to others who attempt to reach originality, and to portray the truth behind human nature.D.",Dogville
279,misterpennycandy,Almost good on paper.,1,6 March 2004,"Breaking the Waves, Dancer in the Dark and Dogville are three Dogme films, directed by Lars Trier in the English language.  The lead roles in these films are doting, stereotypical female character.  Why is Dogville Trier's best film?  It isn't.  First of all, Trier's choice to film Dogville on a stage makes for a very Brechtian experience, sans the alienation. Dogville attempts to be as alienating as the aforementioned two, but rests on its laurels for a good portion of this overlong film.  Many interesting themes are explored throughout the films three hour duration:  Christian guilt, entitlement, dehumanization.  In the end, you feel, not unlike its protagonist, raped, taken advantage of and chained up like a dog.  The film is shot on a stage - sets are indicated by chalk markings.  It's also shot in HDTV.  In this sense the film feels like nothing we've seen before. Although Peter Greenaway (sort of) took a stab at the filmed-play format with Prospero's Books, Dogville being on a stage makes it all the more limited and claustrophobic.  The story doesn't have any comment on these themes I've mentioned.  It's just a neverending downer with no true purpose except an arena for Trier to punish his weak female characters.  The town slowly turns against Grace, and soon they are torturing and raping her. Confused, ignorant, immature, jerks who, we are supposed to believe in our heart of hearts, feel they are completely justified in their actions.  Men are portrayed as cruel polymorphously conniving cowardly crafty and evil subhuman.  Women are portrayed as stupid, confused, overly possessive, insecure, vacuous, equally cruel, bullying and matriarchal.  I try to avoid spoilers in my reviews, but I'm trying to prove a point here.  I might be mistaken, but I'll take my crack at it.  I think, at first we're supposed to believe that these people are good.  Grace enters their simple world and finds a safe haven, a pure simple kind of life - a departure from whatever horrible, living hell she emigrated from.  They show their teeth, and at the end, hell opens up and they are judged.  The ending is so a-bit-much, violent, disturbing, unsettling, gut-wrenching and just plain VILE, but is such a fitting conclusion for this film.  It's almost as if Trier creates these evil characters, and destroys them - but attempts to make this more than a revenge pic.  Sad but true, he does depict these evil characters as victims of their own nature.  We understand their behavior, but we cannot forgive them.  Trier is manipulative, but at least he's good at it.  At times he thinks he's channeling Felinni and Bergman with his unapologetic depictions of desolation, hopelessness, loneliness, emptiness and sadness through the ridicule of his characters, but he's too angry, he's too disturbed.  There is little grace (no pun intended)in the way he stresses these messages.  The problem is, he's overintellectualizing them.  He's attempting to show us that people really are treated this way.  I'm not sure if he's using this film as a One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nestesque metaphor for society (in keeping with ""USA"" trilogy) or creating an arena to showcase his internal anarchy or ferocity.  It isn't clear if he just wants to make us feel bad as him or as bad as we should.  Any way you look at it, this is the sort of film which can't be deemed good or bad.  Then again, in this case, textbook filmmaking techniques have been eschewed in favor of a minimalist, theatrical approach.  Without the frills of a major motion picture the focus is on the acting and story.  The acting is a mixed bag: Chloe [name I can't spell], Philip Baker Hall, Stellan Skarsgard and Lauren Bacall deliver lame performances, while Nicole Kidman, Paul Bettany, Patricia Clarkson and [the guy who played the mayor on Oz who, in Dogville, plays a miniature version of Lenny from Of Mice and Men] steal the show. The dialogue is very well-written.  The structure of the screenplay is difficult to judge because it is mostly a catalyst for Trier to play out his ugly fantasies.  This isn't a review, but if it was I would say see it, one thumb sideways, N/A+ and see it for free if you can.",Dogville

281,sfbearcop,Harsh truth about the human condition,9,24 March 2006,"It is interesting to me that it takes a foreigner like Von Trier or Ang Lee to cut through all the BS and make films that go to the heart of some portion of the American condition. While ""Dogville"" could have been made about any country in any period, setting it in Depression-era America made it more relevant to an American audience, whether they liked it or not. I liked it.When Grace's father talks about people accepting responsibility for their flaws instead of being given a free pass for them, I nearly cheered. Grace's willingness to forgive and excuse is at the heart of the liberal world view. Carried to extremes -- as Grace has done -- it is a sickness. I was pleased to see her cured. I might have spared the children -- I'm an American; children are held dear and often blameless. It's a flaw, I know, but Von Trier can move beyond it.I sat in my office at home and watched the film from midnight to three in the morning, unable to turn it off or to turn away from the harsh truths on stark display. Everyone in the cast gave praiseworthy performances and anyone who thinks Kidman is just a pretty face needs to see this performance and be proved dead wrong.I'd recommend this film to anyone with a willingness to face hard truths.",Dogville

Lars Von Trier, an interesting director without question with some very good films under his belt, decided to make a movie like a play, or something like that. So all the characters act out this movie pretending to open doors and walking around chalk outlines intended to be furniture or whatever. I have no idea what the point of this gimmick is. If you want to do a play, then go ahead and do a play. I have no clue what Von Trier was thinking with this abysmally boring movie. It is three hours of lifeless, self-indulgent nonsense.I've heard the movie is somehow supposed to be anti-American; I didn't get that. Perhaps I didn't notice that theme because I was too busy wondering aloud how a movie with such a good director and great cast could suck so remarkably. I'm American and I more or less detest the present course the United States is on as much as the next reasonable person, but if this movie is trying to say something about America or society or the state of nature or anything else remotely deep or interesting, then I'm afraid whatever theme it's going for is completely undercut by the fact that the movie is interminably boring.This is nothing more than a three-hour gimmick.

Painted outlines on the floor delineate the buildings and other props. To that weirdness, add the fact that it is a pretty scummy and unrealistic story. Finally, make it a loooong story. Artistic? Maybe. Cutting edge? Maybe. Bad? Well Many have said Dogville has a subtle plot that takes a while to develop. I can't argue. Watching it does feel like a lot longer than 3 hours. With no visuals, it is really just a dialog movie. Basically, it's a book on tape. If you want to watch a book on tape (rather than listen to it) here is your chance. In the realm of books on tape, this one is a milestone. But I for one want to watch a movie to enjoy the power that a movie can bring to a story, i.e. recreating the images I picture in my mind when I read it. If that is not done for me, what is the point of sitting down to the movie? I give film-makers a little leeway to get creative, but that ultimate task is paramount to my enjoyment.

This is the only one of Trier's films I have seen, but not for long. Of any of his movies can come close to this one, I'll be more than satisfied.In the movie we follow many different characters, but most of all the woman grace(kidman). She is on the run from the big city gangsters and seeks refuge in the small town of dogville, were she is very well received at the beginning, but dogville shows it's claws eventually and the towns behavior to grace gradually get's more and more ridiculous, all into it get's sad and criminal.The movie is so well written and directed that you don't pay any attention to the missing set. The fact that the ""set"" is only a floor with white paint on it is amazing. No American could ever have made such a movie. This is really Dogme film at it's finest.

All I knew was that ""Dogville"" had Nicole Kidman in it- an actress I have always liked- and Lars von Trier, a director I have always respected. I was quickly surprised by what the film was. Set entirely on a stage/sound stage I couldn't believe my eyes. As a theatre actor it was exciting to see how this all was going to work out. Dogville did not disappoint. Lars von Trier clearly creates a town that may seen ordinary and odd into masterful. Nicole Kidman was excellent and the supporting cast was flawless. It was great to see Lauren Bacall and I enjoyed her performance. When I first saw Paul Beattany in the film all I could think of was the awful film ""A Knight's Tale"" that he is also in. However he proved me wrong in his well developed character. Patricia Clarkson was great in her role as Vera, she is a stunning actress. If she keeps getting these great roles an Oscar is sure to be in her future. The film on the whole is wonderful. My only complaint was the length. Around the 2 hour mark I was getting kind of antsy, but the film brought me back to finish the roller coaster ride that the film gave. Truly an original. Go see it.",Dogville
286,mlopezib8,Dogville or the darkest side of human beings,9,2 August 2008,"Dogville is an experiment. Lars Von Trier didn't have the idea of setting the action on a stage from the beginning but did so due to budget reasons. We won't ever know how Dogville would have been in a realistic frame. But we do know how this Dogville penetrates slowly inside you and ends up as a devastating outbreak. At the beginning of the film, the viewer has some difficulties to get into the plot and forget the fact that this is not a conventional film. Past 20 minutes, if you have been patient enough, you'll probably have understood the game Von Trier is proposing to you. The plot seems harmless and kinda boring but little by little, the actions turn out to be hard, cruel and difficult to watch. Dogville is no land for heroes or good souls. Dogville is a place where people are ready to whatever to get what they want. And this reality is like a punch in your stomach. The cast is incredible in their far-from-hero roles. I admire Nicole Kidman for having led this weird project, very different from what the industry of Hollywood offers and something that could ruin the career of a famous actress. Some American critics and users have rejected this film as it's supposed to be Lars Von Trier's view of America. Let the political be the global and get ready to face the most disgusting side of human beings. If you know how to enter the game, you won't regret it. Or maybe you will.",Dogville
287,sangyounko,Great film!,10,24 May 2020,"I'm not really a fan of Lars von Trier but this is one of my favorite film. It had a deep observation of human. The people in Dogville were ordinary people and they accidently had a chance to get authority on Grace. They didn't have a choice on having this authority but they used it in a wrong way. In the last scene of the film, Grace tells her father that what these people has done is only a mistake. But this mistake made Grace suffer. Then, do they have to be punished? After some conversation, Grace and her father decides to punish them.
In the real life, leaders some times do huge mistakes. Some people say it was only a mistake and we have to forgive them because they had a lot of pressure on that position. This film gives a serious question on this situation.
The Lars von Trier style camera and the fresh background drawn with chalks was also great. I can't recommend this film to everyone due to it's sad and heavy tone, but I highly recommend this film to people who want to think about human morality deeply.",Dogville
288,bardgirll,What happens when there is power without forgiveness?,10,27 December 2004,"At times I thought this movie was long and that the main character (Grace) had an unrealistic lack of backbone but later I learned that it was all to set the stage for a beautiful work of film art that is most worthy of attention. The whole story centers around a misconception of the main character who is in every sense a Christ-like being. I believe that most people who have seen the film have taken it the wrong way. They see it as a slam on humanity. It's not. It's the negative of the picture of Christ's story.There is the myth among the townspeople that the one who is the weakest and most in need is the least powerful. They begin by treating her well. Later, familiarity breeds contempt and in the end they treat her very badly. It's hard to watch all the mistreatment inflicted on her. Still, just enough balance is applied that in the refreshingly unpredictable ending you can still feel sorry for the horrible townspeople. Grace decides that she will use her power to destroy. There is no last monologue where all is settled to the betterment of humanity. There is only brute force and destruction. She allows only a dog to live. What happens when there is power without forgiveness? This question can be applied in many places. If one takes the current situation in Iraq, if one looks at the retaliation that followed September 11, 2001. One can even look at their own life and remember the times when they have had the power to destroy within reach.I'm very glad to have seen this film.

289,jef-frisone-1,"Not good, a little (well not little) bitter film",1,16 November 2012,"I agree with those who say this film is a disappointment. Funny, I watched this the same day I watched ""Tree of Life."" Within 5 minutes of Tree I knew I would love it, and I did. Within 5 minutes I knew I would hate this film, and I did. But not for the story, since I hadn't seen much yet, but for the, as the French say, mise en scène. It was a theater piece, but if I want to see a theater piece, I can go to the theater. But, unfortunately, it got worse. The acting was too theatrical except perhaps from Kidman. The story was numbing in its non development. First the town people help her, then they demand more for some nonsensical reason (it costs double to protect her), then Tom's solution is absurd. Then they turn to sadistic tortures, physical and mental, but it's not really punishment. Unbelievable for a film that takes 3 hours to tell. And of course the cruel finale that shocked many. Some have said that this could be an anti-Jewish film. Could be, but I see it more as a modern version of Sodom and Gomorrah. Grace is Abraham and at first wants to save the town, before the revealing light of the moon convinces her to have it destroyed. Whatever, this film is not worth the trouble thinking over long. It is not, clearly, a brain teaser like Mulholland Dr or Tree of Life. It is pseudo intellectual at its finest, like other films by this director, like the equally mediocre Melancholia. Final note, while watching this I didn't think it was especially anti- American, but once the end credits started rolling, it was a shock to hear Young Americans and to see images of poor Americans. Then, and only then, I thought that this piece is anti-American, and I believe it is. The song itself is anti-Americana at its best. Then I thought that the cheap set might reflect the idea that American life is seen as cheap and artificial, compared to the real, authentic European life. In any case, I can't recommend this film.

290,joshkmapes,Not as wierd and Pretentious as one might expect,10,28 March 2004,"I'm not a fan of Von Tier, but the way in which this film conducts itself is truly interesting.  When i saw this film, many people left during the first hour due to boredom.  I'm usually not drawn into movies that try really hard to set themselves apart and behave strangely.  but the characters and the set up of this film make it unique and watchable.Mr. Von Tier has never been to America, which i think makes me able to appreciate this film more for what it's trying to do. It testament to the abstractness of our ideas about things about which we haven't the slightest clue.  He's never been to America, so he doesn't have a clue.  but yet, he has the right idea on some things, others he's way off.  And he's just a little bitter and close minded like the townspeople of dogville.  And maybe that's ok.  The film and it's set-up are stunning, and each scene is directed with a purpose.  He draws upon many techniques of theatre and Brechtian principles of drama.  The end credits did leave a bad taste in my mouth, though.The actors really come into their own.  IN each scene, i got a sense of their fear of screwing up or frustrations about conflicting with a difficult director.  I find nicole kidman too frail, raspy voiced, and whispery. She's like this all of the time, and acting isn't really pretending to be week.  but in this film, in the last hour, she's incredible.  I'm a negative person and usually don't like movies and rip everything to shreds  . . . but this is her best performance.  By far.  All the other actors are perfectly cast, and you can tell they fully embrace the set and the style of the film.
The set really is Beautiful, and it reinforoces the story.  Stunning all around, and worth seeing.  Even though its message is highly debatable, it's form is something new and fresh, while building upon the old and refusing to be another gimmicky art movie.  See this movie.  It actually dared to try something new.",Dogville

Because ""Dogville"" is not an entertaining movie by any stretch of the imagination. It's a disturbing, emotional masterpiece. I know this word is overused but I can not give another definition for this film but a masterpiece. As you probably have read in the other reviews it looks like a play, the houses don't even have walls and are just chalk lines on the ground. Strangely enough, that is actually a plus for the movie as it allows the viewer to concentrate his entire attention to the story and the actors' performances. And the lack of walls intensifies the feeling of community which the Dogville residents have (in a sense that everyone is aware what the others are up to) which is very important for the idea of the movie.And talking about acting, here is where ""Dogville"" really shines. We have Nicole Kidman who lives up to her great reputation and delivers an awesome performance as Grace, an innocent and naive woman who hides from some gangsters in the little town of Dogville. Never overacting or taking all the attention upon her, she totally nails the part. Her face and especially her eyes give a perfect representation of the pure and all-forgiving woman Grace is meant to be. She is supported by a group of some very talented actors like Paul Bettany who is nearly perfect as the all-knowing but doing nothing, philosopher Tom. Anyway, there are a lot of good movies who rely just on the actors brilliance to mask the poor plot. Not the case here. It's a very symbolic and engaging tale, the film is nearly three hours long but I hardly noticed that when I watched it for the first time as it never drags. The ending is very controversial and has kept me thinking about it in the few days since I watched the movie. But not with being unclear - it's very clear and seemingly easy to understand but it's really open for interpretations from a moral point of view and can inspire a lot of interesting discussions and thoughts. It has also one of the most unforgettable and thought provoking dialogs I have ever seen on screen followed by one of the best scenes I have ever watched. You need to see it to believe me. From a purely cinematographic perspective, there is the audacity of Lars von Trier to shoot the movie with a hand-held camera. But nevertheless it has some truly breathtakingly beautiful moments despite the lack of proper sets - Grace laying in the back of the truck comes to mind. The important thing is that it totally works unless you care for the perfection of the vision more than for the idea and message of the film.I was really amazed to see a lot of people who attack the movie as being ""anti-American"". That's not the case, it has clearly a lot more to do with the decline of the human society as a whole than with attacking the American way of life. What makes this movie special apart from the philosophical questions it boldly raises is the level of emotion. I can only speak for myself but I have never hated movie characters more than some of those in ""Dogville"". They develop all the time and the fast and easy way in which a human being can lose its whole humanity and turn into something deserving nothing but hatred, given the right circumstances and victims, is both very disturbing and realistic.Just see this movie with an open mind. You will probably either love it or hate and judging by the very high rating it has on IMDb, chances are it would be the former.:)",Dogville
292,scotti2hotti,Woof Woof!!,1,26 December 2003,"The title of this film is so ironically apt.  Dogville is exactly that, a dog of a film that should have been put out of it's misery long before it even made it to a cinema screen.  Not even Nicole Kidman immersed in a bottle of Meryl Streep Versatility can save this lazy, dull, ugly bore of a film.  This is one big Poochie.

293,Rowi111,"Who's the ""dog""?",9,10 November 2004,"This movie is a brilliant film which I can only imagine has come from an even more brilliant novel. Dogville shows a wide display of human emotions and capabilities. Moods change from fear to love, to contempt, to hatred, and finally into a state of incompassion which reaches beyond human nature. Or does it? What Dogville so accurately chronicles is the capability of mankind under certain situations to be cruel, without empathy. These same feelings of hatred, when combined with feelings of inferiority and superiority, create relationships like history has displayed through slavery and hate crimes, the side of human nature that we don't want to see.Dogville is told in a simplistic ""story book"" fashion which parallels a fable or more accurately....a parable. Countless morals are revealed, some open and easy to interpret, while others are harder to understand. But it is surprisingly difficult to view much of this film. It sickens me to my stomach to see humans act this way, but they are not beyond our capability. The thing to think about in the end is whether Grace gave into the hatred, reverted to her human nature, played God, or simply taught the world a lesson. A lesson that she had just, in fact, learned herself.",Dogville
294,jportwood3,Our town is not this town,7,15 November 2003,"I walked into the film not knowing anything other than a recommendation from a Catalan friend. Immediately I was shocked by the ""Our Town""-like set, no walls, chalked outlines of buildings, miming opening doors, etc.I heard a sigh from my friend and thought, we're not going to make it through this film are we?But as we progressed we were drawn in by Nicole Kidman's mesmerizing performance. I agree with other critics in the fact that if it weren't for her performance, we couldn't have handled this heavy monologue (and narrated) film.I felt at moments I was watching a Hawthorne morality story (a la ""The Scarlet Letter"") mixed with a Marquez magical realism short story (""A Very Old Man With Enormous Wings""). The camera work was inspiring, especially scenes when we were suddenly given true omniscient narrator viewpoint from above.By the time the end of the movie neared the end (which you are prepared for by the ""chapter"" titles) I was enthralled. But then Von Trier spoils his universal message about human frailty and wickedness with the closing credit still shots of Americans from the 1930s and Bowie's ""Young Americans.""His ""politics"" seem to be worn on his sleeve and taking a cheap shot at ""America"" when anti-American sentiments are running high seems a bit weak. I rather liked the idea that the romanticizing of ""poor"" people and ""simple,"" ""salt of the earth"" folk is a fallacy instead of learning that he just had it in for a country on whose soil he's never even ventured to step.",Dogville
295,ghosh77,A Classical Tale Told with Modernity,10,29 June 2014,"""Dogville"" is a new kind of film to me. The film is presented like a play in the theater. The benefits of film techniques are forsaken. But that helps the film. It becomes classical. You are free to fill the detail yourself. It becomes timeless and surreal. The story is simple. A beautiful girl takes shelter in a town named Dogville. Some people and police are looking for her. Tom, a young idealist helps her to settle there. Initially it goes o.k. But problems seem to intensify. The real drama begins. Things begin to change rapidly.I feel spellbound after watching the film. The film attracts my attention with its very different story telling technique, as if I am watching a novel written by Thomas Hardy on the stage. As the story progresses, I doubt, if I am witnessing an old Christian play, or if it is an Italian mafia story. There is so much left to the viewer to interpret and imagine.Dogville is a film to be remembered.",Dogville
296,lasker_98,A combination of genius and obvious mistakes,9,19 April 2004,"Nicole Kidman gives the best performance of her life and one of the best performances ever given.  She has this consistent warmness and a use of her eyes that is astounding.  She really kept the film together, and she really gave an extraordinary performance.The set was very creative, and I believe that it added to the film.My problems with the movie were with the direction.  I do believe that human beings are in general immoral, although not cruel, and never all-good or all-bad.  It was almost as if Lars Von Trier was borderline and splitting the townspeople.It would've worked better if the town had not entirely died and there had been a few righteous people.Ben Gazzara's character was probably the only decent character in the entire movie, and he wasn't saved.  Anyway, I would've liked to have more righteous characters to make it realistic, and I would've liked for the ending to be more in tune with the rest.Basically, I see academy award nominations for Kidman (who should win), Gazzara, Hurt, Bettany, and art direction.  I think that overall, it's good enough to see the great performances, and a great conversation piece.I just would've done things differently.",Dogville
297,lasker_98,The film,9,15 May 2004,"Spoilers, somewhat implied, not majorDogville- Deserving of praise, and criticism Reviewer: Palme from San Diego, CA USA Dogville is a masterful, intuitive, and original concept brought to life in a master diagram of symbols that ask you to interpret their analogies and interactions in certain ways. It demands that you compare it from the tale of Christ, to the tale of the immigrant. For many, Christ is the path they have chosen, as Grace, the main character, sacrifices her being to please a small town's inhabitants. The beautiful set too, must have a purpose. The chalk drawn lines, and the bare sets must represent an allusion to ancient times and the lack of substance representing oldness and lack of substance in people's characters, as the viewer soon finds out, as Grace becomes haunted by continual abuse after the people have the slightest reason to abuse and torture her. I see it differently, it is the tale of a woman that wants to stand above the all-too-apparent animal nature of the world by continual forgiveness and continual humility in all regards. By letting herself get tortured, and forgiving, she is making herself divine. She plays the divinity willingly and arrogantly. She resorts to what she does later because she realizes that she cannot be divine without taking things into her own hands, for being divine also means power. The arrogance in perfection is never enough.The faults of the movie, really only lie in the end credits, which were offensive, and the sheer length of the project, which made it somewhat arduous. However, if the ending song had not been used, I would've given it five stars.The thing I though was most amazing about this movie was Nicole Kidman. This strong actress is used to playing people with a love of breaking down as dramatically as is possible. In this movie, she transforms herself so completely by creating the world that the director planned for herself, and becoming Grace. She looks as if she has lost a will long ago to cry, she's lost the will to emote, but there are feelings and vulnerability that come to her amazing eyes, and she strikes fear in the hearts of viewers. She gives a performance like none other that I have seen, and carries it through dignity, presence, vulnerability, understated elegance, and the ability to seem full of pride that she gives tiny nuances for and a clinging arrogance that can make her seem full of importance and and silent dignity even when put into the most compromising of conditions. She transmits pain flawlessly and elegantly, and the performance was mindblowing. She deserves an oscar for it, she made such an incredible use of her eyes. It's perhaps the best performance by an actress ever put on the screen. The challenge of the role was unthinkable, and she met it, surpassed it, and she melted so flawlessly into a wounded woman's soul and bared it. WOW!!!The rest of the cast was very good as well, but Nicole Kidman gave the most thrilling. Paul Bettany should get some recognition for his intellectual run as Tom, the suitor and protector of Grace. Ben Gazzara gave a highly stylized performance as well and I was taken away with his intitial scene with Nicole Kidman. There styles so different, it made for a terrorizing experience.This is a good movie, with an incredible performance by Kidman and a great supporting cast that is a must see for any Kidman fan, or independent film lover.",Dogville
298,acticom,Masterpiece!,10,27 February 2012,"I remember reading Roger Ebert's review on this film. The guy freaked out. Ebert always freaks out when he does not understand something. And, I think, his misunderstanding is shared among many Americans on this forum and elsewhere, who think this film is anti-American. In fact, this film is as much just about Americans as Crime and Punishment is just about Russians and Notre-Dame de Paris is just about French. If they were, there would not be generations of people all over the world reading and analyzing these masterpieces.This film is simply set in America, but it is about any humans regardless of their ethnicity. It's such a deep and compelling study of human character - I haven't seen a comparable film for a long-long time. No, this film is not for everyone - one needs to be used to watching art house films. Yes, the setting is theatre-like, so trust me, this will be the best theatrical performance you've ever seen. And yes, it *is* Nicole Kidman's best role!

At first I was curious, but not too enthused about what was going on. But as the film progressed I became more and more interested and involved in it's story and characters. But I have to say, that it was the ending and the lessons as a whole that really blew me away.Having said that, don't let anyone tell you anything about the film, especially the ending. It will most likely ruin it for you.I think this film does a lot more than say human nature is one way or the other, it shows us a plausible situation and then asks us what we would do in that situation, and why. I think it teaches many lessons, especially since one may start out in the beginning agreeing with certain elements, and by the end be on the opposite side.If you want a movie that will make you think and question some of your very basic moral beliefs, this one is for you.",Dogville

302,howToDie,Dark social parody by the contemporary Voltaire,10,29 August 2007,"Lars van Trier attempts to remind us that the moral rules which we think govern our daily lives are very fragile and could be easily altered to justify even the gravest of crimes.One aspect of this fragility is what is known as in-group/out-group problem which might explain why social groups have different sets of moral rules when it comes to treating outsiders. This dichotomy can explain why the value ascribed to the live can be so different. The distinction allows otherwise 'good people' suspend their ordinary moral rules when it comes to outsiders. In extreme cases, this resulted in persecution of Jews by the 'good Germans', torture of terrorists by the 'good Americans', or bombing hundreds of thousands of German civilians to death during WWII by the 'good British'. And in this respect, Grace's social status allows for this selective morality to take place. She has never been accepted by the villagers and hence ordinary moral rules did not have to apply to her.Another aspect is that morality often gives in to other more pragmatic considerations including those of economic benefit. Again, one of the contemporary examples could be the oil grab by the US branded as 'energy independence' policies which has the popular support across the entire country. And in the movie, as villagers start to realize clear economic benefits associated with Grace's presence their conflicting economic interests escalate the situation to her downright exploitation. Since ordinary in-group morality does not apply in her case, there is no limit to how sinister this exploitation can develop. As long as she remains excluded from their tight social group, it is not immoral even to slave her sexually.Finally, van Trier clearly believes that moral rules can be equally suspended by anyone in the society. So, in this respect there is no difference between evil gangsters and righteous villagers, rationalizing philosophers and primitive philistines, spiritual church-goers and pragmatic atheists, or even corrupted adults and innocent children. All members of these usually contrasted social groups manage to participate in tormenting Grace due to psychopathic, economic or political reasons.Perhaps this startling uniform complicity of entire society is the focal point of van Trier's work. This irresolvable problem in which every individual and society at large is responsible for horrendous crimes committed throughout the history of humankind is so grandeur it begs for some sort of solution. And although the director's solution might seem containing a self-referential problem which might require extermination of entire humanity, nevertheless under this vision it is clear why even a baby was killed in the aftermath: to save the world from the 'human plague' before it has the potential to harm anyone.The story is thus a startling critique of both society for being a cruel divisive exploitative authority, and the concept of 'morality' for being fragile and essentially meaningless. It is an excellent dark social parody from the contemporary Voltaire.",Dogville

305,arjohnson-1,An Obvious Allegory,8,4 March 2010,"Dogville is a minimalist, and somewhat critical and pessemistic, allegory of America from its inception to relatively modern times (and by extension, if loosely, of the Western world). If that first sentence makes you think ""wtf?!"" then this isn't a film for you; you're probably one of the residents of Dogville without actually realising...maybe I am too. Like a theatre production which makes good use of the audience's imagination, this film is intentinally sparse, set in a studio with painted outlines of buildings, streets, plants and even dogs. I read that as an intention for the story and characters to be the most, and only, thing that should be on the minds of the viewer; it works.Whether that allegory is based in the time the film is set in 1930's (post-) depression America or modern-day America is a finesse that a non-American would never understand: it seems equally valid today.The story centres around the arrival of Grace (Kidman) to a small mining town known as Dogville, which has seen better times but is now secluded, isolationist and introverted. Grace arrives as a refugee from oppression, and meets the beautifully-acted Tom (Bettany) who hides her in the abandoned mine. If you want a dry synopsis of each chapter of the film, Wikipedia does it well.In my view, Grace represents the ideal of America (not necessarily the American Dream). Her journey throughout the film begins with hard work to become accepted, her gradual, graceful and brutal exploitation and eventual submission to the very thing she fled from in the first place.The various supporting characters are relatively easy to define as aspects of American society - Tom represents the well-meaning liberalism that seeks acknowledgement and approval for good deeds whilst exploiting that which he seeks to protect, The Big Man (James Caan) represents imperialism (in the guise of organised crime) from which Grace sought to escape, but to which she ultimately returns after the abuses she suffers at the hands of those who don't understand her and seek to use her for their own ends, etc.This is a movie that is as entertaining as it is hard to watch at times. If you're prepared to think about what you're watching and accept the director's criticism about the way we live, it's very thought-provoking. If you watch it literally, there's not much here for you and maybe a Steven Segal or Jean-Claude Van Damme movie is more your speed.I personally thought the credit music of David Bowie's ""Young America"" was a bit heavy-handed, and purely there as a ""this is what the movie's about, stupid!"" comment, simply because you either understand this movie or you don't; if you haven't got it by the end credits, then a song isn't going to illuminate you.Overall, it's a sublimely-acted film, perfectly cast and very engaging if you appreciate theatre and can look beyond the obvious.",Dogville

I just knew that everyone seemed to adore it. When the picture first came on, and the caption read prologue, and the scene looked like rehearsals for a major motion picture, I thought, What the hell is this? Did I press a ""behind-the-scenes featurette"" instead? I just hated it, the whole way through. I give credit to the director for being innovative, but it's not my cup of tea. I'm the only kid on the block who despised ""Crouching Tiger"" too. Give me a real movie with superb acting and a runaway script any day; I'll fall hook, line, and sinker every time.

But Dogville was the proof of my false assumption.However, emotional release is probably the last thing that speaks the greatness of this movie. How Von Trier deceives and plays his audience like puppets through Dogville are things that make me consider putting this movie side to side with Synecdoche, New York.Through this movie, Von Tier invites you to a seemingly sophisticated discussion on human nature and morality. He treats you like an equal colleague and nods in an agreement on whatever ideas you proposed while gently directs you to ideas and point of views that will be employed to make his point. He will provoke you a little and then discuss your reaction to the provocation before supporting your rationalization with an inaudible patronizing tone.In the end, he will hand you a gun and tell you that you have made a perceptive point. You'll start blazing that gun to all directions. And you know that it's already too late when you hear a tiny giggle coming from behind. You maybe dismiss that victorious giggle altogether and delude yourself into believing that you only do what you're doing for humanity. Or, you can laugh in a horrible excitement without noticing Von Trier's giggle and accept his view on humanity. Either way, you lose.10/10",Dogville
308,pieintheface,Decent and Thought-Provoking although slightly Irritating,7,11 April 2004,"One has to admire Lars Von Trier for taking risks with his work. Anyone can make a crowd pleaser like Jerry Bruckheimer, but that wasn't even von Trier's intention with Dogville. One can tell that this movie was made more as a statement than as entertainment. It falls into a genre all its own.
People have said that the movie is insulting, minimalistic, and anti-American. They would be correct on all accounts. Von Trier takes no pains to hide his disdain for America, a country he has never visited. However, let's not dwell on this peculiarity, because Dogville is not about America alone, but rather about all of humanity, with a special emphasis on America. Really, the anti-Americanism did not affect me in the least. It is an art form and his freedom as an artist should let him say whatever he would like. Thus, I will not comment on the political statements of the movie, but rather von Trier's general style of movie-making in general. There was one very very big problem I had with this film and that was the screenplay. It was overt, lacking subtlety, and one hour too long. Von Trier takes us all to be idiots and feels that he needs to point out every single symbol, every single nuance he places into the movie. It is as if he feels that he needs to point out exactly how clever he is, because we as an audience are too stupid to recognize it on our own. For example, the symbolism with the apples in the truck and the apple orcards... anyone with higher than high-school English could figure out what those apples represented but von Trier decided to have his third part omniscient narrator blatantly spoon-feed it to us. I like movies that make you think, that are left open to debate. Dogville, instead is a movie, where there is no room for interpretation because everything has been spelled out for you. For lack of better words, it is an intellectual movie for non-intellectuals.
The script was wooden in that he chose dialogue that no one in real life would ever say. It was completely unrealistic. But then again, the movie is supposed to be a parable. Are parables supposed to convey any form of realism or can they be tongue-firmly-planted-in-cheek? I don't understand why everyone is doting on the outstanding acting in this movie when all the principal actors (Kidman, Bettany, Bacall, Skarsgard, and Sevigny) have all been better in other movies. The problem is that all these actors had very wooden dialogue to work with and thus, came off being really wooden.
With all that said, I must point out that the minimalist set was genius. I loved it. After the first half hour, you totally forgot that you were watching everything on a sound stage. The no walls choice was particularly effective in the first rape scene as everyone watched and continued their daily chores. Secondly, the lighting was amazing since you could barely tell that everything was inside given the realism of daylight and nighttime. And finally, the ending scene is mind-blowingly fantastic. That scene alone makes me give this movie a 7/10. Trust me, it would have been a lot lower had it not been for the superb conclusion.",Dogville
309,haselant,Lars van Trier had had better moments before.,4,3 November 2003,"Perhaps you won't do justice to a film by comparing it with earlier works of the director. Perhaps it is sign of your growing older that you do compare. Be that as it may, I could not but compare, and ""Dogville"" comes off badly. In many details, it does not reach the qualities of its predecessors.
The acting of Nicole Kidman, albeit far from bad, is never as convincing as the acting of the heroine in Trier's ""Breaking the Waves"", Emily Watson. There are none of the touching moments that Watson could produce; she played her character convincingly as a victim of her nature, a nature that is partly just a gift of nature, but evidently also partly forced upon her by the influence and educational means of her environment. We do not get to know much about the nature of Kidman's Grace, unfortunately.Most of the characters remain stereotypes throughout the film - which seems to be intended to a certain extend, due to the many allusions to Brecht. But still I cannot regard this as a virtue of the movie.The worst thing about it is the end (this is NOT a spoiler) - the very end, I mean. After the plot is over, we are shown sad pictures of poor people living and dying in the States' thirties as well as the contemporary USA. The pictures are accompanied with David Bowie's ""Young Americans"" - here van Trier manages to give his movie a last and wholly unconvincing twist. With this scene he risks to turn the film into a clumsy and shallow expression of anti-American resentments.

Nicole Kidman who gives a strikingly reserved performance is Grace, a girl with a secret on the run from gangsters. She seeks refuge in a small Colorado town called ""Dogville."" Many of the townspeople fail to welcome her with open arms. For her to stay, she had to work tirelessly for most of the townspeople. Grace's one protagonist is Thomas Edison Jr, (played with sensitivity by the talented Paul Bettany). Thomas serves as an solid bridge between Grace and the rest of ""Dogville,"" as he looks out for her and the needs of town simultaneously. This union proves to be unstable, resulting in an emergence of harsh situations. ""Dogville"" is an overlong film that may not be for all tastes. Running at an exhausting 2 hrs 57 min, which includes a snail's pace prologue, this story could have been told in no more than 2 hrs 15 min. However, the film's goal was to give a detailed analysis on every facet of the story. It did achieve this on occasion, however during other times the flow of the story became muddled. There were however some good points. Lars Von Trier's direction was very organized, considering the amount of characters. The cinematography is striking. And the sets or lack there of establishes the town setting very well as a well-adapted stage play.

It will leave you reeling with questions not only about humanity as a whole, but about your own ineffable, unacknowledged desires for justice and vindication, even at the expense of your own morality.Not to be missed, Dogville is a journey to hell, and maybe just some of the way back.",Dogville
314,R-Grant,"A uniquely layered, intricate film",10,18 May 2005,"A gradually but inevitably onrushing tidal wave of emotional content, this film is far more of an emotional ride than any number of so-called thrillers or romantic comedies.There has been some excellent analysis in previous comments - and some fairly shallow criticism, some of which comes from people who didn't even watch the whole film - so I won't try and dig deep. I also won't retell the plot or comment on the (excellent) presentation of the plot.However in the few pages of comments I read, I didn't see one specific point mentioned fully, so let me make it here. If you subscribe passionately to the worldview that humans are basically good, then you will not like what this film will show you. It portrays humans as essentially bad; people only do ""good"" things to keep up appearances, and either turn swiftly to evil when they can get away with it, or at least do not have the courage of their convictions (e.g. the Tom character).The one potential exception is the girl Grace. She is tirelessly, self-sacrificially good, even when the entire village turns on her.What I see here is a surprisingly clear Gospel parallel. In a place where people seem to be quite nice, a perfect (supposedly) person is placed. Measured up against her - even though she does not come and judge them - suddenly the badness inherent in those around her is revealed. They eventually revolt against her completely, and utterly humiliate her.The part where the parallel ends is of course the end of the film. Grace is, after it all, only human. Christ, at the point of utmost humiliation, under the most pressure imaginable, where stress and irritability in anyone else would have reached titanic proportions, simply cries out in love, ""Father forgive them, for they know not what they do."" Grace cannot do this, and although the sudden, avenging end of the film violently and wonderfully opposes the gradual pathos of all of the previous events, I am left with the sense that even Grace, for all of her goodness, is still not able to match what Christianity claims Christ did.von Trier has certainly constructed a complex, layered masterpiece, of which I think this is a significant facet.Oh, and go watch it!",Dogville
315,Mark_Beronte,"Simplistic, contrived, self indulgent and long winded",1,17 May 2011,"Simplistic, contrived, self indulgent and takes much to long to make it's point.Whatever that point happens to be? Is it that only in America, do small town ignorant people sometimes treat others in the same way they are treated by those more powerful than themselves? Well where on Earth is this not the case? Power can corrupt, and those without any can be overzealous when they taste some for themselves.It should not be a surprise to anyone that, yes, this is a part of our shared human nature, but it has been more cleverly and convincingly and more evenhandedly demonstrated in any number of 1/2 hour twilight zone episodes, than it was in this 3 hour stage play, so disconnected from the reality it is trying to portray.Is it that all people are bad? This is certainly true, but this is only like describing the taste of a grape in terms of it's skin, while completely ignoring its more appealing parts, Humanity is much more complex than this film seems to understand, and the film is an insult to the intelligence to anyone who has given real thought to the good and bad of human nature, where it comes from, and how and when it's complexity is expressed.And what is the point of having it staged? Any message can be more effectively communicated using the full weight of the medium involved. Would it ever truly make sense to make a film using no sound at all, or using only a series of snap shots? Apparently there are many here who might be fooled into applauding such a film for it's originality, when the only real effect such limitations have, is to simplify and limit any originality that could have been possible given no such constraints..In closing this was a long slog through the mud that will only serve to further confuse people who have never had the time to think very deeply on human nature. It is very much like the blind trying to lead the blind, and so perhaps it is fitting that the experience of the average viewer of this film would not be much different from the blind man, who could only listen to it. Not only a waste of bandwidth and creative potential, but of your time as well.",Dogville
316,jordi_smilo,This could have been so much better,9,31 August 2005,"Yesterday evening, I saw ""DogVille"" for the first time. People around me were very enthusiastic about it, and so was IMDb. That's why I had great expectations of it.But after three hours, I was totally disappointed. And though the plot outline was interesting to me, I couldn't deny having the feeling of wasting three hours of my life. And I tell you why.First, the cinematography was completely annoying. Useless camera moves, almost amateur use of zooming and twisting, and, most of all, distant and cold. The editing was painful for my eyes; fast, uncompleted - sometimes I thought the editor did never finish his work! The end was suddenly awful, and it didn't seem to fit with the rest of the movie. The music of the credits showed me a lack of taste; how can someone play such happy music after an awful scene?! And I didn't like Kidman's role; it simply lacked some credibility. Why did she stay in such a horrible place? And why didn't she tell the people of Dogville that she was the victim? That's why my mouth fell open when I discovered by who she was being chased...Though, I really liked the idea and the production design (beautiful minimalistic). But it isn't enough to save this movie. Simply a waste of a fine cast.Mister Von Trier, this could have been so much better.",Dogville
317,gnoxyz,Such an amazing movie,10,11 April 2005,"When I saw Dancer in the Dark, I saw it just because Björk appeared there. However, the movie turned out to be one of the greatest I had ever seen; so when I heard about this new movie from Lars Von Trier, I thought that I just had to watch it. Specially after seeing the trailer because it seemed really clever and original to use that scenery.At that time I had heard some comments about the movie telling that it was ""slow"", ""boring"", but when I saw it, I didn't find it boring at all. As a matter of fact, it's one of the best movies that my eyes have seen (it is even better than Dancer in the Dark) and I think that everybody (mature enough, of course) should see it. It gives you a lot to think about, and the end it's the most surprising thing ever. I'm not going to ruin the end for those who haven't seen it, but I can tell it's going to shock you. Besides, the movie is filled with different emotions and even thought its duration is longer than two hours, the way that the movie is told makes it so impressive.So this is a 10.BTW: Nicole Kidman is an awesome actress",Dogville
318,thomengel-1,There is more to Dogville than meets the eye.,8,24 April 2005,"The film, Dogville, contains more than what the basic plot reveals. While it is true that a beautiful young woman named Grace comes to town fleeing danger, and the town unwillingly accepts her, it is also true that she is not simply Grace the woman, and the town is not simply ""any"" American town. Viewing the film on face value can work, but it doesn't reveal the film writer's intent. If one ""views between the scenes,"" it is obvious that Dogville is an allegory which uses Grace to possibly symbolize God, or perhaps all that is good in the world. Grace enters Dogville seeking refuge and is given it. But when the townspeople turn on her, they will ultimately face her wrath. Grace is good in everything that she does, and she tries so hard to do what is asked of her. Even when she is abused, mistreated, and used, she accepts her punishment and abuse and continues to struggle on. While that may not seem realistic from a simplistic vantage, it is what happens when people struggle to survive. We adapt, give in, try to please, do what is necessary to survive. When given the chance, we would try to escape, when given the opportunity to elicit revenge, we would destroy.",Dogville
319,catharton,"Interesting themes, terrible film",3,30 December 2005,"SPOILER WARNING: Contains a couple of references to the ending of the film.It's often said by many fans of cinema, rather casually, that most people never go and see genuinely interesting films, they only like to watch trash. With Dogville I can see why this might be the case, as it conforms to almost every cliché of ""art"" films without actually providing anything that someone new might be able to grab hold of. It's not a problem when a film is difficult, it's a problem when a film is unnecessarily difficult, which is what Dogville makes itself.Dogville takes a very interesting topic, the right of a person to make a moral judgement about others, and raises some very interesting points about this topic. This lofty aim is what is good about the film, and it succeeds well if you just watch the last ten minutes.But what's bad about the film is the way these important questions are buried so deeply, and so obscurely, that very few people will have the time or inclination to get far enough through the film to encounter them. At film festivals, maybe, but the vast majority of people nowadays see films at home, usually on television.The 3 hour running time, often justified in films and plays, isn't justified here. It makes very little difference to the final outcome whether you've seen all the details of the townspeople's life or not, and as films like this are usually shown very late anyway you'd have to either be unemployed or extremely willing to go without sleep to struggle through to the end. There's very little to help you along the way, and its apparent message that all humanity is animal-like scum doesn't exactly help matters.""You're evil deep down, go on, admit it or you're deluding yourself!"" is hardly the way to get people to think about life, and it's not a million miles away from priests bellowing ""You're sinners ye all!"" at schoolchildren. The mistake made by Grace that the film highlights is similar to the mistake the film itself makes, it assumes an arrogant aloofness from other mass media, and unnecessarily shuts itself off from anyone except dedicated film goers.I've heard this is supposedly an attack on certain political viewpoints, but to be honest how effective is an attack if the only people who are going to watch it all the way through are likely to be the kind of people who already disagree with that viewpoint? If it is a political attack, it's preaching to the converted, a pointless exercise which only seems to entrench views instead of shaking them up.It's also inaccurate in the way that so many academic and media reports on life are: it assumes what's true of many is true of all. Most of us will never invent anything, so there will be no inventions, is the kind of logic they employ. The flaw in it is that there WILL be inventions, with total regularity throughout history, even in the least enlightened corners of the world, bright sparks have risen which manage to spread influence far beyond their numbers. Interesting ideas, interesting philosophies, interesting inventions can all pass into popular use as long as we don't deny their existence or usefulness. Yes, most people never come up with them, but who cares? Most people will never write a song but most people want to listen to music. That's not parasitic or hierarchical or anything negative like that, it's purely a reflection of the rarity of good ideas and talent.In the film, most of the town is animal-like, so the entire town is animal-like. Most of the outsiders are violent gangsters, so all outsiders are violent gangsters. But that's never ever true in real life, there are always exceptions, always freaks, and it's often these freaks who see their society's problems and ways to deal with them.Slavery was once proclaimed a completely indestructible evil, but it was (mostly) abolished, because certain people dared to take a more optimistic approach to life and follow it through.The characters in Dogville are clearly symbols of various groups or philosophies, but nowhere is there a symbol of moderation, nowhere is there a character who does not harm anyone. Go anywhere in real life and you'll see these people exist, but because they're not killing or raping anyone, because they're not interesting dramatically, they never get mentioned in Dogville. The two characters even vaguely near the centre ground, Tom and Grace, both end up doing something very nasty to each other and reveal their true mercenary characters when they feel threatened. Not only does Lars Von Trier inevitably kill off almost all the main characters (this is an art film after all, can't have optimism here), he also thoroughly assassinates their characters.Are absolutely all people like this? No. Does Lars Von Trier care? No.He wants to paint a picture easily, he wants us to believe the majority represents the entirety. Figureheads become a substitute for populations, individuals simply become part of a greater whole with no value in themselves. The fact that nations and movements can wink into and out of existence, or merge and split, seems ignored in this kind of world view. One exceptional person is always insignificant, essentially, because they're in such a small minority.But this can never be the case because it is often from some unnoticed minority or unlikely individual that real advancement (moral, political and technical) comes. As long as an individual can make a difference, it's factually incorrect to say they're insignificant. Ignore them at your intellectual (and physical) peril.",Dogville

321,komsomol,Mixed emotions,5,27 October 2003,"There are two major advantages of theatre performances as opposed to movies: the physical presence of the actors and a certain unpredictability and irreproducibility of each and every performance.  For these two advantages the audience readily accepts the obvious drawbacks: the imperfect illusion caused by the rudimentary set, and a possibly imperfect play.
Having seen Dogville, the question does not seem to be skippable, why the director has imitated a theatre performance and restraining his means to its limited boundaries, instead of sticking to whatever methods film making commonly has to offer.  The theatrical advantages don't apply: Dogville IS still a movie, so there might be no physical presence of the actors when watching it, as there is no fascinating irreproducibility of the performance.  Still the major drawback remains, the limited and primitive set.  Given the thesis, ""less is more"", does a primitive set necessarily lead to salvation?  I bet it does not.  I don't get the point, why I had to suffer for hours and watch a pseudo-theatre performance, having no plus of any kind.  As it seems to me, this chosen method was merely a pseudo-intellectual preliminary strike against all audiences, a vain and doubtful show of an assumed artistic potency, or spasmodic efforts to be and create something... different.Apart from that, the movie is still interesting.For most parts, I really liked Kidman.  Unfortunately the story is unbearable, unless you are a Bertolt Brecht fan.  As always in his case, the underlying piece (""Der gute Mensch von Szechuan"") is a propagandistic story with a moral - for the masses.  The moral in this story is, that there are good people and there are evil people, and well, things mix up sometimes a bit.  Whack, this is the same conclusion you can easily gain by watching any James Bond movie.  The characters are flat; the story is flat and predictable.  Just the acting saves the show.As to the accusations of this movie being a deliberately anti-American one: I disagree with that.  The story is universal(ly flat).I have found the cinematography concept very unpleasant and disturbing. The excessive and arty use of tele lens close-ups is difficult to watch, and limits the actual playing to [parts of] the faces, for no apparent reason.(Just as a footnote: anyone who has seen a dog in his life from less than a mile knows, that no one can ever steal a dog's bone [with some meat on it], especially if it happens to be a Staffordshire Terrier, unless that dog is very, very dead.  In which case it is no stealing.)Casting James Caan as the mafia boss just like in similar roles in ""Godfather"" or ""Mickey Blue Eyes"" etc. is not only an idealess cliché; it is an unjustifiable mortal sin, for which Lars von Trier is likely to burn in hell for the eternity, except if he is to be reborn as a house dust mite and find his miserable death within my computer on the surface of an overheated chip.As a vote, I've given it a seven (out of ten), but I'm likely to revise it in favour of something lower, like, say... five.  Or three.",Dogville

324,hitch39,What a town without pity can do.,7,7 September 2004,"No one taps into pain the way Lars von Trier does. Whether showing the perverse needs of a quadriplegic husband or giving us Bjork's piercing shriek as she's forced to commit a murder, von Trier is somewhat of a film sadist, creating astonishing works that dare to be watched twice. No one else blends these moral fables into bendy genre pieces like him either. He's encompassed the Dogme 95 movement, tackled the musical form and in Dogville, his most daring, experimental piece, he creates a world on the open stage.Dogville is introduced in map form on a stage floor. It's an insolvent, Depression-era town where bold white lettering identifies the different homes and landmarks. John Hurt openly narrates and introduces us to the typical small town folk. The scenery is sparse, a shrub here, a roof there, a bell tower. Nothing is hidden in von Trier's intimate, see-through town. At least until Grace (Nicole Kidman) runs through the town one night, carrying a gun and trying to make her way through the mountains. She's on the run from gangsters and possibly the law. Tom (Paul Bettany), a writer who fancies himself Dogville's moral compass persuades the town to let her stay for a two week trial in exchange for manual labor. It's amazing that Dogville works with this strategy of minimalism. The film separates itself from its theatrical roots with some stunning overhead shots and smart, effective lighting from Anthony Dod Mantle, a DP to watch for.Nicole Kidman infuses Grace with such earnestness and compassion that only the town's crabbiest resident Chuck (Stellan Skarsgard) remains unimpressed. Skarsgard gives Chuck palpable self-loathing and a hatred for Dogville that is evident in every poison-tipped word. The rest of the town seems to enjoy Grace and learns to benefit from her honesty and her unconditional acceptance of them, despite their flaws. That is until 'Wanted' signs get posted in their town and the threat of the law entering Dogville becomes real. From here, we're escorted right back into von Trier's standard chess board of cruelty as Grace walks the tightrope between two evils, the men she's hiding from and a town without pity. Forced to work long hours for little or no pay, Grace soon finds herself struggling against the advances of all the townsmen, much to the dismay of the jealous women. Weeks turn into months and during this time Grace doesn't merely traverse the downward spiral, she's kicked down it. By the time she's fitted with a crude device designed to keep her from escaping, just about everyone has turned against her, even the town's children. The ensemble cast of well-renowned actors do a fantastic job of becoming deplorable in a socially acceptable manner. Through it all, Grace remains Jesus-nice, turning the other cheek, making excuses for the town's poor behavior. Kidman does a wonderful job selling her character's altruism. Her seemingly bottomless fountain of innocence makes one want to beat bloody fists against the screen in revenge and curse von Trier for showing us the darkest part of ourselves.And Von Trier doesn't hold back as he builds to a climax that challenges our own moral compass by forcing us to contemplate what we would do in similar situations and examine the limits of forgiveness.",Dogville

I mean you have to watch it very carefully, but it's very hard to do it (at least for me) the decor was not present, there wasn't any (I mean it ANY!!) action, Nicole Kidman was perfect, others are well as needed. Final was blood-freezing hard and full with all sensations with a human can feel, you can be angry, sad, happy etc about last scenes.Of course this is the opinion of the director, but (I think) movie business is about entertaining the people.

I can say that Dogville has everything an Oscar-Worthy film needs. Great performances, writing and unique direction from Vars Lon Trier. Can any other independent feature be anymore rich in stunning actors?

328,sublemon,Ambiguous and challenging,7,3 February 2005,"Well, this film certainly presents a lot of moral dilemmas and paradoxes. Is it anti-American? No doubt. Does it also, as many people have argued, say something about human nature in general? Possibly. But it is ambiguous in this respect. If it is a comment on all mankind, then why the ending montage and the desire to make the setting so unambiguously American? You could argue that the townspeople behave like the Germans during Nazism, etc., and thus the theme is more universal, but the specifically American imagery undermines this.Also, the justification of mass murder is similarly problematic. Is it revenge, divine retribution, or something more insidious? I mean, it would not be hard to read the film as: Grace--the beautiful, blonde, pure heroine corrupted and debased by the town of vile, lying, less -than-human (dogs in fact) scum, who are then exterminated. I'm not saying that this is what Von Trier necessarily intends, but it did cross my mind while watching the film. I was also reminded of the German Baader-Meinhof/RAF gang who tried to justify their antisemitism as a sort of exorcism of Germany's Nazi past (i.e. they could attack Jews and deny the holocaust because in their words they were trying ""...to get rid of this thing about Jews we've all had to have since the Nazi time."") Again, I'm not saying that this is what Von Trier intends, but the ambiguities of the film do make interpretation open. If the film is implicit that the dogville-ians (i.e. Americans) must be exterminated to make the world better, what about the long history of similar problems in Europe? Are those being denied? Why go to lengths to make the film seem explicitly anti-American, if it isn't? Anyway, this ambiguity does make the film more interesting. At first I had the feeling that the Dogville was very heavy handed and obvious. But in the end it turns out to be complex and challenging. OK, maybe a bit heavy handed at times but heavy handed saying what? Go figure it out...",Dogville

I had saved for my solemn because i found it pathetic to share with that, weird, isn't it? But today i'm not in that mood but i'm bored so i watched ""Dogville"". It's totally wonderful, although it's more a play than a movie but that aspect shows up all the things in Dogville barely, And that's just what we have to see in this one. Nicole Kidman did a terrific job! I was bursting into tears when i saw the parts the Dogville residents treated her, the parts that she was raped, the parts she was chained but the scene makes me weep and also be shocked is the last one, when Grace and her father were watching the whole town in fire, deaths... That proves me something... This girl, Grace... She is too merciful but not routine-mind, but the choice she chose was against all. And that's rational... I think i have to re-watch this movie (or play) more to understand the ending. It's a pretty long one but it worths my re-watch forever! If u haven't seen this, just go rent or buy the DVD now.

331,AndreaBeaumont,"good story, bad ending",7,13 February 2016,"It's pretty obvious that Grace's name represents something more than just a random name. In whole of the film her behavior, actions, reactions are not something that would be considered as ""normal"" human behavior in such circumstances.She truly was the personified ideal, everything good that we all promote and imagine to accomplish in ourselves and in society. Her ""arrogance"" as her father defined it, is exactly it if viewed from humans' flawed perspective. But it is not arrogance! It is an ideal, and by calling it - no, by choosing to call it arrogance - we try to excuse our dishonorable behavior. That's why the ending is not logical nor justified. With choosing to step down on humans' level, get her revenge and condemn the people of Dogville to death, Grace actually negated herself and everything she was the whole time. Now, I would go even further and say, her gangster-family background is not relevant. It is shown throughout the story with her actions, and with her own saying ""I've never stolen anything before. So now, now I have to punish myself. I was raised to be arrogant. So, I...I had to teach myself these things."" It is clear here that no matter where she comes from, she is her own person, creates herself, is responsible to self only. There is one other sentence: ""If she had acted like them she could not have defended a single one of her actions and could not have condemned them harshly enough"". But it is only at the ending that Grace finds herself for the first time, at position of power - and she chooses to behave just like the flawed ones. By judging them to their own standards she actually goes against her own nature.If the acting is right (and I don't doubt that) she watches the executions and cries, but as there is horror there is also some satisfaction in her - seems like a transformation of personality is taking place. This is interesting also from the gnosticism's point of view. If Grace is grace (Sophia), would the ending symbolize a gnostic phenomenon of ""Sophia's fall from grace""?Should they all be punished? Yes, definitely. By their own standards? Of course. But is it up to her to get down on their level as soon as she got the power and do the executioner work? In the ending, what becomes of Grace? And what is done to grace? Was there ever any, or is it the same as the writer who never wrote any.",Dogville

That being said, she was magnificent in this movie playing a frail, idealistic and stoically beautiful fugitive. Yes, there is a touch of anti-Americanism in this movie, but it doesn't detract from its poetic portrayal of small town human weakness at its worst. The lack of traditional sceneries is initially unsettling, but ultimately adds to the narration throughout. It's a very differently made film, and every line, every scene, every expression, and every character is carefully, beautifully crafted throughout the film.

I didn't sleep well after i watched this movie; it hit me like a blow to the stomach.Sure, it's long, boring, and depicts humanity in an excessively dark light.But frankly, I think it's a good counterbalance to all the crap films full of one-dimensional characters who are either good, bad, or fashionably flawed. The fact is each of us is equally capable of both kindness and cruelty, and the line between the two rapidly disintegrates when self-interest is involved. The ultra-minimal setting made this film a serious chore to watch, but it put the focus on the characters; I'm not sure it would have worked so well with a more ""realistic"" backdrop.

I confess I couldn't stand to watch everything, because the violence and abuse are sometimes too disgusting.However, in the end we have a real twist. We get to understand the whole story and suddenly we get in touch with the revengeful core we have inside ourselves.I think it's a film that shows how much evil can be found inside people. Jealousy, envy, hypocrisy and the desire to take advantage of someone who needs help. The main character is nothing but nice and sweet, yet she's seen as dangerous to everyone. The only reason is everyone kept abusing her, what brought light to their unseen failures.It reminded me of Allegory of the Cave in a few moments.",Dogville

If you've already seen the 50 best films of 2003,then dogville might be worth a watch. If you're a snobby critic, or reviewer, this is probably right up your alley.
That being said, the ending was rather satisfying, unlike a lot of other pieces of ""cinematic art"" with some odd gimmick.",Dogville
336,dudesweethej,A piece of art,10,6 August 2011,"Lars Von Trier has a tendency of showing critics at their most embarrassing. His films retrieve mixed opinions, shamed by some, adored by few. This says more about critics than the quality of Von Trier's works, because what film critics apparently don't understand is that Von Trier's films must be seen as works of art, more so than classic storytelling. Dogville tells a fascinating (and terrifying) plot, centred on the ancient Greek philosophical question: ""Is man capable of being good?"" To illustrate and investigate this banal, skinless question, Von Trier creates a banal, skinless scene. No walls to fog the people of the landscape, only what's relevant is shown: The people. Throughout it's 178 minutes playtime, Dogville takes the viewer through disappointments, agony, greed and grief, only to erupt in the most beautifully satisfying ending a movie has ever shown. I'm not implying that that ""other films"" aren't art. I'm not implying that all critics are incompetent. I'm encouraging sceptics of Von Trier, and this film in particular, to try and watch this as art with a shining moral, more so than just a story. There are a couple of contenders, but i wouldn't feel bad calling this the best film i've ever seen. Now, this is of course the tip of subjective but if anyone denied the films genius, i wouldn't hesitate calling them ignorant. Anyone may dislike it, but denying its genius is ignorant. asked me to suggest a film, whether good, great or astonishing, i would probably pick this one.In short, hopefully you'll enjoy this film. Even if not, at least it may spawn some debate in the living room...",Dogville
337,hyperdirector,"Dogville, A New Medium for Film...",9,26 January 2005,"Given my theatre background, Dogville is extremely appealing to me. The Film completely changes the way Film medium is usually represented on the big screen. Not many filmmaker is willing to risk there creativity in other medium like live theatre.I think it was at the turn of the century, there were something called televised theatre, which is the broadcast of live theatre performances. As the development of many new media technology and the ""impossibility of nothing"", live theatre is dying.Seeing a film like Dogville for me, as a theatre goer, is quite exciting. Dogville doesn't belong to any film genre that's already existed, but the film itself is a new form of contemporary cinema. and I hope I can see more film work like it.",Dogville

And the story is beautiful, (POSSIBLE SPOILER) the way that shows the human nature; And the way that Grace(Nicole Kidman) shows all that infinite patience, almost a divine grace. And in the end is like  a divine justice, almost like all that was a kind of a test on human nature, and they failed completely. And when she lets the dog live, because is the only one that had a reason to harm her (but didn't) because she stole is bone in the beginning. Im writing all this, but to tell you the truth, i dont have the words to express the way  i loved this movie.

339,GregDexter,Who's Behind The Door? And Just Where *Is* The Door?,9,9 December 2004,"I'm writing this review to make amends for the merciless trashing I gave elsewhere on the ""Internets"" to Lars von Trier's ""Dancer In The Dark"", which I still consider perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. Needless to say, I was reluctant to watch another of his movies. However, I like a bit of everything and had to try ""Dogville"" based largely on its high IMDb rating. When it was over I walked around the house for several minutes trying to deal with the fact that I had just witnessed a fantastic (9/10) Lars von Trier movie!Unlike some others who have reviewed this movie, I apparently became absorbed in the writing and performance of this film and was not taken aback by the purposely awkward setting and editing. If you haven't read it yet elsewhere, ""Dogville"" is set entirely on a stage--though the stage would probably be a bit too large for most ""live"" performance venues. (I spent some time thinking about things that would have to be changed in this film in order for it to be performed live. Although I watch about 150 movies a year on DVD, I go to live theatre performances several times more often than I go to a movie theater.)If you watch this movie to the end, you will undoubtedly find parts of it a bit ""over the top"". However, as any intelligent kid who grew up in a small town (writer included) can tell you, it isn't as far over the top as some might claim. If you appreciate live performances of edgy stories, I believe you'll like this film and be thinking about it long after it's over.

And boy am I happy that I finally sat down and indulged.To be able to sympathize with every character along this twisted, dark path and become emotionless with Grace as she searches her soul for the strength to forgive and understand how these people are the way they are was very appealing. I was completely encapsulated in Grace and felt every emotion she did at exactly the same time she did. I felt remorse, hatred, sadness and compassion hoping that she would eventually teach them to become what she envisioned.Really I am just rambling words of nonsense hoping to be able to recommend this wonderful film to all. Please see it and you will also become speechless but feel that you are articulating it properly and with purpose. Everyone should see this and push themselves to live life and trust in the goodness of people like Grace.",Dogville
341,algis-4,"Gripping, powerful and moving. Don't walk out early on.",9,17 July 2004,"Every now and then you watch a film that really holds you in it's grip. It leads you in, gets you to follow along with the plot to the point where you feel that you're controlling the film's course yourself. You feel that every event is, of course, what would happen next at that point.Dogville was such a film for me. Once I'd got used to the bizarre, minimalist set - which was like going to the theatre - the brilliant acting of the characters (especially Nicole Kidman) had me hooked.I think this is a very powerful and moving film - certainly a 'must see' for anyone who appreciates a good movie. My advice is to not be put off by the initial scenes, the apparent early slow pace and odd book-like narration and chapter headings. Chapter 9 is definitely worth waiting for.9Algis Kuliukas",Dogville
342,pisanond,A brilliant film,9,26 December 2004,"I watched this film after much of the controversy about it at Cannes had passed. The buzz in the U.S. press was that the film was slanted and reflected Lars Von Trier's ignorance of American society. Such arguments are specious on their face--there are examples of great literature and film making where the creator never set foot in the setting, as any reader of Shakespeare well knows. So discounting the self-appointed guardians of America, what exactly is this film about, what are the film's merits and why does it evoke such strong feelings from its audience, especially American ones? What Von Trier has done is take several American icons: the gangster, the small town, the woman in distress, the ideal of the common person, the local sage and the wise elder gentleman doctor, and has turned them on their head to create a timeless play about human motivation, greed and the corrupting influence of power. The people of Dogville are on the surface simple and decent people. Grace's arrival and her helplessness is the catalyst that, step by step, tempts the people of Dogville to inflict upon her greater and greater humiliations to feed their now unrestrained desires. So complete is her humiliation that the twist at the end leaves the viewer very little sympathy for the fate of Dogville's citizens. It is a powerful message and the judgment of the characters is one that takes no prisoners. That there are more than a few examples of this behavior in contemporary American society (and in the American past) and that it confronts these issues directly is the reason for the controversy surrounding it and--apart from the brilliant acting, especially by Ms. Kidman and Paul Bettany--what makes it great art. Von Trier has made a movie that is part of the quintessential American proletarian artistic tradition and its setting in 1930s America is part of the film's genius. That he is not an American and that this movie did not originate in Hollywood should give us all pause. There is a scene in which Grace confronts the people of Dogville with a critique of their bad behavior. Their response is to either deny the truth of what she has said or to blame Grace herself for tempting them. This movie, without being preachy or dogmatic, attempts to provide its own critique and received much the same reaction as the movie's protagonist. I would not be surprised if this was Von Trier's original intent. Dogville is a disturbing and powerful film.",Dogville
343,sleazEmike,Be careful- you may waste three hours of your life,1,25 March 2005,"I rented this movie last night, expecting a masterpiece. It had very high ratings, (currently is the 218th highest rated movie of all time on IMDb), an interesting plot, and not to mention one of my favorite actresses, Nicole Kidman. It also got rave reviews at the Sundance film festival, and usually they are dead on. Let me tell you this. The ""setting"" of this movie is something that may turn off a few watchers right from the beginning. I almost dismissed it, but decided to give it a chance. The story became slightly enchanting, and about an hour into the film, I decided that the movie was worth my time. But then something shocking happened, and it left a bad taste in my mouth. I then knew what this movie was ultimately going to be about, and I was right. The movie endlessly went on for another 2 hours. The depiction of the average, common man (Americans)in this movie is far from accurate, and is despicable. It even had a surprise ending, but it left absolutely no satisfaction. The acting is average at best. I believe the high ratings are due to the films originality and ""hidden meanings"". I picked up on these, but in no way did I find it entertaining, or mind-enriching. This film just simply should not have been made. I hope my vote of 1 takes this movie down a notch, and hopefully this movie will eventually find its way off of the Top 250 list.",Dogville
344,Hippychik8,Excellent study of humanity,8,12 June 2005,"This was an excellent study of man's inhumanity to man. At first, the movie moved sluggishly and I was hard-pressed to gain an interest in the characters, but as time went on, I began to see the true nature of each of the individuals in the story. I think writer/director Von Trier was trying to make a commentary on life in America, but I feel it was unfair of him to choose the setting during the Great Depression. Those were troubling times, and who knows what lies hidden in the depths of each of our souls during those kinds of times. I think if this story was set in any other country, it would work just as well, but only if the story took place during a specific time of tribulation in that particular country, such as our Great Depression. The story itself was riveting and Nicole Kidman was unsurpassed in her scope and depth of the character she plays. It was fun seeing old familiar faces pop up in one role or another, like Ben Gazzara and Lauren Bacall. Although the movie was quite long (three hours), I think it was necessary to complete the entire feeling for what came after. One thing I enjoy after seeing a movie is imagining alternate endings (which some DVDs add these days), and I let my imagination run loose with this one. I was not especially happy with this ending, because I did not feel it reflected the mind-set of its main character, Grace. However, I found the movie as a whole very thought-provoking and worth watching.",Dogville

347,Bri-10,Left me just short of satiated,10,8 October 2003,"I must say, I was waiting to see this film more than any other for the past year. I saw it Saturday night, and I can't say yet that I've totally formed my reaction to it. To a certain extent, like McBuff said, it lacked an emotional impact, such as Dancer in the Dark, which leaves you sobbing no matter how many times you've seen it. I've nothing against so-called cold movies, like Kubrick's were often described, but they never sear into your memory as much as the more emotional ones. Also, I agree that the credits sequence, with the Bowie song and the images - those left more of an emotional impact than anything before it. Had the whole film felt like that, well, I'm sure von Trier is capable of doing such a thing. But I also wonder, and maybe he's explained this, why he tacked on these photos and song? I was never bored, and the lack of a traditional set/props while the film still holds your attention is testament to von Trier's story and the amazing performances of the actors. I think it's the most stripped-down performance one could see, in terms of how exposed a story and an actor are. At a play, the fact you are seeing real live people is itself a distraction. In this situation, you are more removed and more able to make a judgment based on ""just the facts,"" if you will. That being said, I thought the movie was hysterical, acting amazing, I loved the set experimentation - it all worked for me. The narration thing was worn well too, helping to create a fairy tale feeling. Hurt's dialogue was funny, it wasn't intrusive or cheap like it would be used in a Hollywood movie. But I was left feeling slightly disappointed. The ending didn't leave me all that surprised, and seeing an ending coming is always a letdown.

349,RayRoko,Exploration of the darkness of the human soul,10,23 December 2003,"If one is looking for a starter to this heart-tearing masterpiece, I suggest My Dinner With Andre from 1981. Another movie from which you get a feeling of having read a good book. Very few films render that feeling, but these two do.Where to start describing the bouquet of feelings this masterpiece has caused in me? A good point is admiration for Nicole Kidman's mix of wit, grace, innocence scented with beauty that, as the film evolves, turns into a thick film, a pellicle of suffering and enduring, glued together with forgiveness. I do not wish to believe that those qualities can be displayed credibly without the actress actually possessing them ( :) ? ) From the point Chuck takes advantage of Grace the first time, I couldn't stop occasional shivers the just-observed caused me, so much it touched. The conclusion can be drawn after watching the film: one cannot know his/her true nature unless given a real ungoverned power over another living being. They all seem nice in the beginning. The power and a sense of opportunity of free use only amplify themselves in Dogvillians. The evil seed in Chuck spreads among all the dogs, or were they all evil a priori?Artificial settings? One stage? Please! They are forgotten in 10 minutes. As all true works of art, this thing glows from the inside, it doesn't need a vivid facade. Long movie? I would have liked to see maybe an even longer one, but it would have probably put me into even sadder mood watching the ugliness killing the grace.Indeed, Tom, a great illustration of the fact that humans haven't changed from the medieval or perhaps even more primitive times - still dismissing the truth about themselves as lies, the truth that only very few of them are unselfish, decent in terms of morale and even 1 cm away from the animal desires for flesh.Grace concludes that she wouldn't have been much better had she been born in Dogville. I disagree - one can be no matter how poor but still cultured, at list on a microlevel of one person, on a macroscale culture of course doesn't develop without having material funds at its foundation. Then a human raises his head from a plug and looks up in the sky, and connects with Love, and then the decency is born in him/her as a little fire that can't be put out by any amount of torture inflicted upon her/him. The decency can also be transferred from a parent to a child.Dogville got what it deserved, in the end, justice comes in and flushes the inner hollowness created by co-suffering with Grace, heals the pain.

The inhabitants of the town Dogville doesn't develop to real characters which is quite necessary to make it interesting, to bother what's going on. Nicole Kidman does a good job, but it isn't sensational. The setup is somewhat interesting at first, but the pace is too slow and after awhile I was hoping for something to happen, a new scenery, something.

I seriously think  that it adds nothing new to cinematographic vision (See Straub-Huillet's America adapted from Kafka), it is presumptuous in its rendering of the so-called American society in the 30s, it reduced filmmaking to a cheap theatrical version of a play (If anyone wants to see real film/theater, should see some of the far superior French nouvelle vague films).

353,hans-c,A work of art,10,12 August 2003,"I was greatly impressed by Dogville, which I consider as a work of art - in the best sense of the word, but also with my eyes wide open to the likelyhood of dissent. Because... as one Danish movie reviewer beautifully put it: ""It is a movie that speaks to your mind, not your heart"".
That, in my view, sums it up. In stripping the set down to a barren ""Mutter Courage"" meets ""Waiting for Godot"" setting, and shaving the action to a 2 1/2 hour-long americanised pastiche on ""Der Besuch der alten Dame"", von Trier has definitely shown us something NEW.Has he also shown us something GOOD? My personal view is that he has: Having used the Dogma concept to strip directors naked - left as they are with only their directing skills to rely on - he now does the same to the actors. How could a mediocre or unconcentrated actor hide on a barren stage where no one ever shouts ""cut""? In Dogville we have a movie that for a change puts acting back at the forefront. And the actors rise to the challenge - notably Kidman, who is magnificent.Does that mean, we should LIKE it? Well, we are in the same situation as the art gallery goers were back at the time of the Great War when the abstract artists introduced the non-figurative arts. In truth, only the art pros at first marvelled over the works of Klee and Kandinsky. The rest of the crowd quietly growled ""...OK, maybe it's art, but who cares if one cannot even see what it's supposed to depict?"".I guess for the years to come Dogville will be loved by those who have seen enough Turners (metaphorically speaking) for a lifetime and who want something radically new. And it will be shrugged off by those who go to the cinema purely to be amused, entertained and feel good.",Dogville
354,Satine_25,A Different But Entirely Wonderful Film,8,2 August 2007,"I'm going to begin this review by pointing out that this movie has some very, very, very slow points in it. So slow that I would occasionally flip through a book I was reading at the time until something of interest caught my attention and I was watching again. But the parts that got my attention were well worth the dragging moments in-between. This may contain spoilers, so you are warned again. Nicole Kidman's character, Grace, is running from the mafia (for currently unknown reasons) and seeks shelter in a small little town out in the middle of nowhere. The town actually reminds me of what the original American colonies might have looked like or an Amish town, but with technology. The townspeople reluctantly agree to hide her but they ask that in return she work for them just like everyone else in the town. Of course, the grateful Grace agrees willingly and eagerly sets to work to help the community that had accepted her despite the obvious dangers. But gradually, Grace's jobs become more demanding the play less and less. One of the happy things in the town though is that she finds love in a man named Tom (who is a soft spoken gentle man who likes to ponder things). Unfortunately, the other men also take notice of Grace's outstanding beauty and begin to threaten her with her safety if she refuses to sleep with them. In turn, the women blame this fact on Grace herself and punish her by breaking some of her most prized possessions. Grace finds she cannot escape from the demented town and is forced to put up with their cruelties, despite whatever small help she gets from her lover Tom. Again, one thing that I LOVED is the filming and set design of this film. It's almost as if you're watching a play. Everything is labeled in chalk (the streets, the graveled path, the bushes, snow, etc.), the houses are represented by tall wooden flat pieces of... wood, there's an actual truck though and tables and other such things. I loved this concept... it's like seeing a play but paying the price for a movie. Now to talk about the things that horrified me the most. And this is where the SPOILERS come in. * When Grace tries to escape in the truck only to be returned to the town (why they were so hellbent on keeping her I have no idea... it seemed rather silly but it made them all seem the more crazy) and forced to wear a chain around her neck that was attached to a large metal wheel that she was forced to drag around. This was complete with a metal collar with a bell attached to it so that they all knew where she was. * When Vera forced Grace to watch her shatter the beautiful ceramic figures that she and Tom had been saving for months to buy when she found out that Grace had slept with her husband (though this was more of a rape as Grace tried to tell the upset Vera who would not listen). This made me sob, to put it mildly. * Tom's betrayal. It broke my heart that he should defend Grace this entire time only to realize that he had never really truly loved her and had only been afraid and had been using her. He then calls up the mafia to come and get Grace, hoping that it would be the end of it. Which brings us to the ending (MAJOR SPOILERS!!). I LOVED the ending more than words can say. I was hardly surprised when it turned out that the mafia man who had been hunting her had really been her father the entire time and that he really had no intent of killing her but instead to make her a partner (something she wanted nothing of). He also offers to take her away from the town, for somehow he knew all the cruelties she had been put through here, and that his men would kill them all if she so wished. She replies that she would rather live with them than with him and that none of them were cruel at heart. Her father then asks her to step outside and take a walk to think it over, which she gladly does. I love what happens next. She sits on a bench, looking down at the town, and thinks about how the townspeople were really just scared. She thinks about how she would have done the same if she were them and that she never really thought them wicked at all. And then, the light changes and in classic literary style she sees the townspeople's true natures in this new light. She then calmly gets back into her father's car, says that she wishes them dead, and tells him about a mother with children. When the killing is done and all of Dogvilleis dead, Grace sees Tom whom she asks the men not to shoot. She then takes a gun herself, listens to his pleas for forgiveness, and kills him herself. Like I said, I love this ending more than words can describe. At first I was really REALLY upset that she would just forgive them. I was outraged that she might let them live. Then I breathed a sigh of relief. It was truly a very moving, beautiful moment. One of the most moving that I've seen in a movie in a long time and in a way it was almost poetic. This movie could not have ended any other way. Bravo!",Dogville
355,jjtanner,Intriguing but deeply flawed,6,14 May 2007,"The setting of the movie was refreshing and simple. It allowed the audience to use their imaginations. The movie started out well but by the end of its 3 hours became quite tedious. The acting was good but the style of the film was disjointed, which hurt the overall flow of the film.The film is a thinly-veiled pessimistic, cynical, and depressing commentary on humanity and specifically the U.S. What is almost laughable, however (if it wasn't so sad) is that the writer and director of the film so completely misunderstands the U.S. as well as the rest of humanity. The sociopolitical commentary is as one-sided and flat as the stage the film is acted upon. In the end, the film turned into a preachy lauding of the supposed virtues of moral relativism.Early in the film I thought how wonderful and refreshing it was; however, those thoughts quickly faded away as the message of the film was bludgeoned over and over while the film turned more cynical and depressing (I don't mind a good depressing movie - this movie just wasn't that good). So, no matter how much I really want to have liked this movie, I can't bring myself to like it very much.

I didn't know anything about the movie besides the basic plotline: a fugitive from justice seeks refugee in a small town that takes advantage of her. I knew that it was shot in a stage and that it was being criticized for being anti american. To my surprise and being a big admirer of both, Von Trier and Kidman, Dogville exceeded all my expectations. The movie is about major issues and throughout its exciting imagery, raw performances and sharp script, Dogville digs deeper than what its detractors are saying about it. It is not, in no way, an anti american film. ***WARNING. POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD*** My interpretation is that it is metaphor on Jesus, as a female character, an arrogant rebel that denies her own father (because she doesn't understand his and thus, her power) and doesn't want to be her daughter.She's kind, noble, and teaches everyone how to be a better person and how to be useful, but in the end they turn against her, condemning her and -metaphorically speaking- crucifying her. Then, in a surprise ending that is literally taken from the Bible, she decides to do God's will in Dogville. It is a really brave decision from Nicole Kidman to do this character that may cause some heavy conflict in some viewers, and its is a triumph for Von Trier to choose such an exciting way to shoot the film, after all, if God is everywhere and see us from the top, he should see trough walls and ceilings.

SCREENIT, my all-time favorite movie review site, rated it a 6/10. And, as I recall, Rottentomatoes also praised this movie, giving it very high ratings. I don't know. I'm a curmudgeonly movie-goer, perhaps. But that doesn't mean I'm closed to the abstract. My point: ""Dogville"" did not appear abstract. It came off like a behind the scenes view of a play rehearsal. I want cinema, not theater. Can any of you IMDBers out there convince me to believe this movie deserves a second chance?",Dogville
359,ednoisin@hotmail.com,Synopsis of the American tragedy,10,7 November 2006,"Dogville is perhaps the greatest movie I've seen in many years. The director seems to have a profound understanding of the American culture which, I thought, I was the only one to share. Here is a town which people live in peace but in a very boring way. The young intellectual of the town realizes that Dogville needs a gift to give it a soul. Nicole Kidman shows up on the scene as the personage of ""Grace."" Grace is pursued by the mob and finds safe haven in Dogville. In return, she offers her devoted services to the town. The town now seems to have a soul; ""complete power"" over an outsider in which no accountability is required. Little by little, they take full advantage of Grace, simply because they can. Even the black maid and her crippled daughter cannot resist the temptation of hurting and exploiting Grace. This is a picture of America who has been tremendously blessed to be a beacon of light to the rest of the world. The more America becomes powerful without no other nation to oppose her, the more arrogant, selfish and cynical she gets by ""drunkenning"" herself with that power. America exploits without mercy and does it covertly. The end of the movie in Dogville was so needed and so imperative; would America meet the same end after fattening herself with its avarice toward wealth, materialism, selfishness and complex of superiority? I prayerfully hope so.",Dogville

Which I must say I don´t care in movies like `The green mile' or `Magnolia', but I swear I never felt so bored in my life. I just could laugh out loud at some parts, it was unavoidable not to do it. My favourite scene was when the gangsters arrive to Dogville looking for Grace and she hides in that kind of `mine'... what can I say???

If I was Grace I would have started given serious thought to haulin' tail over that mountain-----she did have a map after all----around the time she was told try harder so the townspeople would get over the Wanted Poster. That whole bit with the blind man who refuses to admit he is blind?  Takes some deep thinkin' to get that meaning of his character. The only thing that I really enjoyed was the set.

Yes, it does take courage to punish someone even if you have the position and power to do so, and to forgive is nothing but a cowardly human act.A million times in a life time one is betrayed and cheated and insulted and raped. Each time the only thought that comes to our mind is that I shall show no respite when the tables turn. In about a Thousand times, the tables do turn and you have every opportunity to throw yourself and inflict upon your victim with total rage. But, how many times do you actually go for vengeance. Compare the times when you actually did take revenge to when you forgave. How does it feel after you are content with the tit-for-tat?

Dogville is one of the few films around that grabs hold of you within the first few minutes and doesn't let go until the end.Nicole Kidman gives an astonishing performance just like Bjork and Emily Watson did in 'Dancer in the Dark' and 'Breaking the Waves'.Personally I feel that Von Trier is making fun of films like Pirates of the Caribbean and Matrix, which both cost 100's of millions of dollars to make. Instead of focusing purely on the aesthetics of the film he concentrates on the characters and their emotions. I agree that for some people who don't like to have to think during films (and I'm not saying that as a negative thing) will find Dogville a terribly boring film, but for any film buff, you will find that Dogville is a masterpiece.",Dogville

368,lee1999,Pious Moralism with Arty Pretensions,3,1 February 2006,"Dogville is a pseudo-Brechtian film that gives itself a lot of formal airs (although mostly of the familiar ""filmed play"" sort rather than anything cinematic, despite the de rigueur jittery camera-work) but then boils down to a theological commentary on good and evil, on ""grace"" and retribution, that only gives people the ""moral"" satisfaction of walking away thinking, ""Yes, it's so true that there are simply good and bad people in the world--and I want to see the bad ones pay!!"" No complexity there.As for the anti-Americanism, von Trier can't really redeem this kind of simple-minded moralizing just by running damning photographs behind the end credits, when nothing in the film has established any political relevance beforehand. (And given the racism condemned in many of the photographs why on earth does he have to turn the black mother into a parody of Mammy in ""Gone with the Wind,"" right down to the ""jis' ain't fittin'"" dialogue?) None of this succeeds in disguising the fact that, like Hitchcock, von Trier is basically just filming a beautiful blonde being abused, without even the self-deprecating wit that makes Hitchcock's films readable as commentaries on blondes being abused, not sneaking celebrations of it. Letting the blonde take bloody revenge at the end (with her daddy's power) hardly turns this into a feminist fable.So you'll spend a lot of time watching compelling acting (though the heavy-handed ""irony"" of the voice-over gets tired very quickly) that adds up to very little.",Dogville

Nicole Kidman is compelling as a mysterious woman named Grace, who stirs up a small down with he abrasive ideology and homespun views on their western customs. The small town is really one huge sound stage that has chalk outlining as its boarders, and the way Lars puts these to used is a good way to comment on how close we are together as people. Paul Bettany is good as Tom, the man who helps Grace in this little town and Lauren Bacall is stunning as Ma Ginger.

Little did I know (nor was it mentioned anywhere in the promotional literature) that the director's vision was to produce a play and then bring his hand-held camera onto the stage to film it. Why bother with shooting on location when you can simply create streets out of chalk, mountains out of cardboard and buildings out of papier mache? In fact, why bother splurging for actors at all -- they might just as well have used puppets. Apparently, the Blair Witch Project had a bigger budget than Dogville.This atrocious, overly hyped, self-indulgent waste of celluloid lumbers along for THREE hours, purportedly with some vague social message about Americans and Americana. Fortunately, I realized where things were heading in the first fifteen minutes and fast-forwarded through the rest to save myself any more tedium and frustration.What was the director thinking?

My friend told me that he wasn't able to finish the movie. At many point of time I contemplated the same thought only to give in to the curiosity that how mature the movie is going to develop from that point of time. But I'm sure the way everything developed is a pure candid representation of the thought process of humans and though the dark nature of us is always apparent to us in many forms, nothing can make you prepared for when you confront it at that moment. More than Grace's character, Whom I loved the most of is Tom who reminds of myself and many others more than other characters that no matter how much intellectually inclined you think you are, we are all the same because the nature called pride which everyone holds it close to their heart in one way or other and when that is threatened we panic.Even though i was taken along the mood swings of Grace when she confronts her father and herself, I felt the actions weren't justified initially. But I do realize that we act at some point of time during our confrontation and in this case I'm confronting even after Grace has acted upon it.This is my first viewing and sure my views are gonna change after the second because it will reduce a great percentage of the shock.

The sparse scenery of the studio where it was filmed not only fill you with wonder and awe originally but also emphasise the latent talent of the acting on display. Having not been a huge Nicole Kidman fan before the movie, I no longer need any convincing that she knows how to act.The film has so many allegorical references and such a tight, succinct script that on each viewing you can discover new possible meanings or discover a new telling facial expression on one of the characters.The beginning of the film is, admittedly, fairly slow moving, but the way the film is shot to near perfection creates the perfect rose-tinted view of life in a rural mountain village before the picture is gradually distorted and ultimately ruined.Although the movie is set in America and plays with some American values the messages within the movie definitely have universal rather than specific meaning. The power politics within relationships and the temptation of abusing accepted human ethics when the chance arises, especially when living in a despairing town without hope could strike a chord with any country.After seeing the movie for the first time everyone in the cinema looked stunned. And so was I. I couldn't sleep for about a week or so because the issues and questions it raised about the human condition were so poignant and probing.Without question you must watch this movie.

And the rest is a social degeneration of human trash parade. And if you're looking for this subject, just turn on the television at Chechenia or Bagdad or Palestine news.

382,fritzoid,A Magnificent Edifice Housing a Big Lie,8,12 April 2004,"Lars von Trier has never been to the USA, and I've never left it; who's to say which of us is in a better position to judge?I think ""Dogville"" is masterful movie-making: the stripped-down set is a marvelous concept, giving as it does a God's-eye view of the proceedings, especially when seen from above.  But von Trier is conflating his own point of view with God's.Make no mistake about it, this movie is not meant to be about Human Nature in general; it is a statement about America and Americans, and it is insulting, slanderous, and false.I grew up surrounded by small-town America, and granted it ain't always Mayberry.  Outsiders can find it very unwelcoming at times.  But once they're accepted, the mentality of ""protecting our own"" comes to embrace them as well.  There's no way that what Grace went through could be considered representative of ANYTHING, let alone our national character. It is purely and simply a false picture.  There's more truth in five minutes of ""News from Lake Wobegon"" than in the three hours of ""Dogville"".Now, I'm no Rah-Rah cheerleader for the USA; American capitalism definitely has its victims, and we leave an over-large footprint on the world politically, culturally, ecologically...  But on the whole I think Randy Newman's satire is on point: ""No one likes us, I don't know why / We may not be perfect, but Heaven knows we try.""  To paint the USA as a second Sodom, where not a single righteous individual can be found in order to save us from destruction, is the action of an Ass.By the way, von Trier does like to put his heroines through Hell, doesn't he?

There are some good performances here, especially Bettany, and I suppose the lack of sets is novel (though I thought it got old, and worse, distracting)... but ultimately, do you have to sacrifice any and all entertainment value to make your bombastic point? And someone should tell Mr. Von Trier that the first time you see the main character get raped onscreen it's disturbing and upsetting, but by the fourth time, it's just bleakly repetitive. The ending was waaaay too long in coming. I didn't think this movie was especially anti-American - and hey, I dislike humanity as much as the next person.

384,DrunkenHaydn,"An immensely profound, unobtrusively unsettling masterpiece",10,30 August 2019,"Like many, during the opening of the movie, I too thought ""wait, am I going to spend 3 hours watching a movie that takes place on a bland stage in its entirety?'
And then, I gradually melted into the world, with my emotions and imagination crescendoing in unison. I became a part of the small town and added mindly embellishments in accordance with the way the people spoke of the environment, I started seeing the mountains around, the splendorous views, the apple trees and it was bland no more. So much can be achieved with minimalism, if used properly.This movie is terrifyingly deep on many levels. It does indeed bear the not-so-subtle suggestions of capitalism but there is so much more to it, the entirety of human psychology's been crammed into this 3-hour audiovisual venture through the whole spectrum of human behaviors, constantly imposing the famous question ""why?"", thus provoking the viewer, with each next possible answer, to track those behaviors down to their very roots.
This is a movie that very successfully illustrates (as Tom would say) the diverse manifestation of frustrations that share the same source: unsatisfied psychological needs. It shows what humans can become when they live a life of habit, monotony and loneliness, ever suppressing the desires of the soul, either consciously or, more often unconsciously, only to submit themselves to a system of living that is expected of them, that the environment had established and continues to practice.
It represents the contrast between the two paths in life, the first being the easier and more common one (the majority of the world), that is, gradually creating an alter ego where you're right about everything and whenever something happens you just point the finger at the world, only to avoid confronting your personal flaws and the bitter truths that come with them and invest conscious effort to become a better and stronger person, and the second path (Nicole Kidman) being that of purity of the soul and everything that comes with it-honesty, humility, gratitude, selflessness, empathy, understanding.
Know how a nervous breakdown occurs? By submitting oneself to what the world expects and casting aside everything one really wants to do, forgetting about dreams, adventures, love, diversity, the childlike curiosity that doesn't simply evaporate over time but that we rather bury because it becomes a luxury in the world. And every time one does so, more and more is added to the sediment in the bottom of the soul, until it is overwhelmed and bursts suddenly, leaving the witnesses-even the close family-shocked and puzzled. This, if not genetics, is also the birth of personality disorders (narcissistic personality disorder for example).Every member of the town needs something. It would be easy to say that they are simply ""inherently evil, greedy, manipulative"" and so on, but that's a rather shallow diagnosis. The source of every negative behavior is in the lack of something positive. The absence of love can only be healed by the presence of love. Here, the lack of good things that every human being needs is displayed as an alternative alleviation of the frustration by means of negative energy emission, as most of humans do, not knowing where the real problem lies.Chuck has been lonely his whole life. He lives with a facade of a marriage where love vaporized long ago, if there was ever any at all. He has many children that he probably considers to be more of a curse than a blessing, and has to work the whole day to feed them, in a sempiternal cycle of habits. Since his fixed frowns are not enough to express the misery inside, he points a finger at Grace, making it look as if she is the one to blame for his misery, and proceeds to rape her.
And similar things happen with the rest of the residents. Nothing here is personal, it never is. When people want to release their burdens, they act like parasites. They attach to the most adequate host they can find (in this case the innocent, angelic Grace) and they gnaw at them. Grace is only a vent, she is neither a reason nor a trigger. The silent and innocent kind of people always end up swallowing the garbage of the world, right? They are always the best targets, because the most effective way to alleviate an inner suffering is uninterrupted anger and violence.We don't only see the contrast between those two paths, but also within the people treading the first path. They treat Grace with a posture of superiority and yet they're weak. They blame her and throw their anger at her out of fear. Ultimately, they chain her. And, as Tom suggests, nobody wants to admit that they are camouflaging their personal defects with their behaviors.
An unpleasantly realistic picture of how the primitive, survival instinct overshadows the ""goodness for the sake of goodness"" and mutates what we would call ""a universal system of values"" into utilitarianism, in the fragile psyches of the simple folk who lack a conscious approach to their emotions and self-analysis and therefore rely on instincts to do the ""thinking"".
Even Tom, the bright philosopher who seemed to be helping Grace, succumbed to his fear and the natural instinct to defend what is his. He fought with himself throughout the movie, being ever indecisive about whether he should confront himself and therefore the residents, in the name of justice, or adopt a quiet and more pragmatic approach. Perhaps the best manifestation of his own personal war was near the end of the movie, on the bed with a chained Grace: controlling his inner anger, he speaks to Grace about how he turned down the whole town for her and how he deserves praise for that and his ""pain and suffering"". While being a seemingly gentle scene, the psychological gravity here is aching.
The irony in watching a person who allegedly ""sacrificed"" himself for the greater good play a victim and cry for acknowledgement while talking to, at this point, a SLAVE, was nothing but painful. Once more it depicts how, when we are too busy being obsessed with our own burdens, we forget to empathize with people and we place our suffering above theirs, even if theirs is far more severe.
On the other hand, Grace manages to absorb everyone's misery and perfectly understand why she's being misunderstood.Ultimately, it exhibits the limited capacities of understanding and tolerance due to the simple fact that we are human, posing the question ""for how long can a person act as a vent for the world, absorbing everything and expecting nothing for oneself, before erupting in the form of a complete antipode?"" This is the eternal war of the pure, humble, empathetic people, the war between the desire to understand the world perfectly because one cognizes the source of all that vanity, and the natural, personal need in life, the need to receive something for all that has been given, which, if completely neglected, can shatter into what we saw at the very end.The camera work, the powerful allegory behind scenes such as ""Chuck rapes Grace and the view recedes to display and emphasize the absence of walls"", the usage of light and the usage of Vivaldi's music is all but spectacular.",Dogville
385,agabuga,"Read what you want into it, just don't expect any coherence.",3,29 July 2008,"*****SPOILER WARNING, THIS REVIEW CONTAINS THE ENTIRE PLOT OF THE MOVIE, BUT IMO IT'S NOT A PARTICULARLY GOOD ONE ANYWAY***** I have to start by saying don't let my rather damning review of this film discourage you from seeing it. I know people who love it. I, however, did not. If you're curious then just watch it.It's about a small town in Colorado that receives an unexpected visitor, on the run from gangsters. After some discussion this quiet, small, conservative town collectively decides to harbour the fugitive. Their initial insistence that she is welcome to stay without any form of repayment is gradually eroded until she is reduced to the status of a slave/beast, and eventually is turned over to the gangsters by the one resident she had come to trust the most. The gangsters arrive, their boss is her father, and after a discussion with him about the inherent difficulty of ethical behaviour in humans (and a brief moment of clarity on the part of the fugitive) she swears allegiance to the father she was running away from and orders the gangsters to massacre everyone in the town and raze it to the ground.The plot's reasonably interesting, but my problems with the film are mainly the thematic jumble and confused message of the piece. The film is about trust, betrayal, tolerance, loyalty, friendship, love, sex, abuse, isolation, revenge, compassion, the baseness of human nature under certain circumstances and...oh god, just too many other things.It feels to me as if so much has been crammed into one film in an attempt to make it interesting to everyone, completely missing the point that if a universal theme is well explored then it WILL be interesting to everyone. We don't need a dozen themes thrown at us all at once.This is reflected in the acting, which, despite being top-notch from all concerned, is distracting. The film doesn't work as an ensemble piece. Perhaps if the focus had been more heavily on Kidman's fugitive it might have held my attention a little more, but as it is I didn't know which characters were protagonists and which were antagonists, at any point. This might work in a murder mystery, but this film is resolutely anti-genre.In a way it is also rather anti-film, being filmed as it is on a blandly furnished sound stage, with chalk marks on the floor delineating buildings, plants, street edges etc. If this neutrality had been carried out throughout the rest of the piece, then the device might have worked, but it's (quite emphatically) set in Colorado. After 90 minutes (another thing, 150+ mins is just too long) I was yearning for some cinema, to see those mountains the characters keep on talking about.There is so much potential squandered in this film that I resolutely watched the conclusion, hoping for some redeeming features, but to no avail. But as I always say, just watch it and make up your own mind.",Dogville

I found this movie to be interesting, but not captivating. The mythology was founded on an interesting intellectual principle (that humans are above animals, that they can distinguish right and wrong, and should be judged as such), yet I found this piece to be an academic essay rather than a great work of art.I agree intellectually with many of the points in this movie, and was looking forward to the unique Black-Box-Movie approach. However, if that is your gimmick, you must make sure your characters are damn good. I was not sutured into the characters. Their respective plights did not stir my emotions, nor did their interactions seem particularly realistic or compelling. The narrator told us every conclusion (purposefully? pretentiously? comically?) we should make. Additionally, the story arc after a brief uplifting beginning, was entirely downhill for too large a portion of the movie (much like Requiem for a Dream). I feel that when Lars is at his best is when he makes an uplifting comment in the midst of the harsh reality of the world (such as Bjork in Dancer in the Dark).Overall, a good movie, 7/10.

Difficult to follow by the viewer used to constant leading, explicit reference and the persistent presence of the unnecessary. The first transformation turns a difficult film into a heavy weight: suffering and un-reasoning are explained first hand to whoever witnesses such humiliation and is left without comfort. We will alternatively identify ourselves with the victim or the villagers, or just leave the game. There will be, nevertheless, no place of comfort. The second transformation turns a heavy weight into raw liberation. Witnesses will find reparation. It is not the return to a balance previous to the conflict, but awaited reward.If you have plenty of motives to explain your behaviors, if you are in peace with yourself and you wouldn't change that, if you choose films that give you just what you wanted, then do not see this one.",Dogville

The thought that anyone can take this tripe so seriously as to believe that it conveys some deep message is almost frightening. As for the pictures that accompany the end titles, several of them could have been photos from my childhood, so perhaps that is why my shock and horror was less than complete. If someone actually thought that this movie could enlighten people and change the world, may I suggest that a better idea would have been to have taken the money it cost to produce this movie and spent it feeding hungry people or paying the college tuition for many young people who will not have that opportunity. If you want to change the world, go meet people who need help and then help them. Don't think that watching a movie pays any debt to society. Especially this one.",Dogville

The reduction of the set and surrounding elements (as weird as I found it as first) centers the focus of the viewer on the cast and story - and it works!

Starting out, I even felt that what I had was a certain version of the original film and had to check on the internet to see whether that was the case. Initially I couldn't see the point in choosing to make a movie like that. But I was sure Von Trier had a point. And he did have one!The bare minimal setting allows us to focus on the more important things. IMO the setting signifies how the townspeople always considered themselves right but at the same time were always exposed in their heinous acts. The character development is excellent specially for ""Dogville"" is full of shallow and narrow minded people.I saw the end coming though I am not sure I just wanted it or expected it. As Grace suffers through the film so do we. Throughout the film Grace tries to uphold her beliefs and seeks validation from the people of Dogsville. In the end, she lashes out with vengeance realizing how wrong the townspeople were. Kidman's work is commendable. The movie's a bit long but quite gripping.

I had only seen one Von Trier film previously, ""The Idiots"", which I thought was interesting and original. However this is a big step up from that film and contains superlative performances from all the main actors. Its real triumph, however, is that it forces the viewer to explore many different viewpoints of both situation and character simultaneously throughout the film. There is no absolute moral standpoint in this film. It allows the viewer to judge each character and event for themselves and attempt to come to some sort of conclusion at the end. This is a difficult thing to achieve given the complexities that are dealt with over the film's 3 hour running time. But it will leave you considering the meanings of words like moral, ethical and what it is to be human in the world today. IMO those who see it merely as an attack on the USA are being wilfully short sighted. It has a universal theme and is not confined to a criticism of modern day capitalism. Overall, I would recommend this film to all lovers of intelligent cinema. A major triumph.",Dogville

Some acting is technically very well, but never it succeeds in sucking me in the story. This movie was certainly a very big disappointment to me !!

Set in theatrical environment, the same during all the film, we can feel oppressed, almost suffocating in this small, closed space. Sad and pessimistic colors, no view, no sun. The actors are only a few, there is one plot, not complicated. But still the image is engrossing and kept me seated for 3 hours.

399,scottackerlund,"""Curtains""",10,27 August 2012,"Dogville is a truly unique presentation that can hardly be called a film but rather a representation of the human condition. The film starts with Nicole Kidman's character, Grace, stumbling into a small mountain town in Colorado in efforts to escape her gangster family. Tom Edison, played by Paul Bettany, finds her and offers her shelter and safety in the town of Dogville. After convincing the rest of the townsfolk to let her stay, the citizens begins making Grace perform tasks around the town in exchange for harboring her. But after a series of extremely odd events, personal sexual attacks, and a general mistrust among the people, Grace decides to try and run away with the help of Tom. Unfortunately her plan is foiled by the freighter, Ben, and she is sent back to Dogville to be chained in order to prevent another escape. Ultimately, Tom calls the gangsters who are looking for her to the town to take Grace away but she convinces her gangster father to burn the village and gun them all down.The underlying theme of the piece is quite evident in the title, Dogville. As humans we are nothing more than dogs ""obeying our nature"" as Grace says. We can only go so far with out eventually reverting to our primal nature in means to survive. This characteristic is hidden to us on an everyday basis, shielded behind large curtains, but when we pull back the curtain the ugliness and true nature of humanity is exposed. We can not truly see our world until we choose to push the curtains away. This aspect of the human condition is perfectly exemplified in the way Von trier decided to present the story by planting the actors in a world without walls. The entire film takes place on a sound stage with only chalk lines drawn on the floor to separate the different areas. This helps to unify the human condition by not setting the story in a specific place but rather a more general experience that would cross borders, both physical and social. Essentially, we are mere dogs that will be put down in order to propagate the survival of the rest of the planet.Along with the philosophically important themes, Dogville comes to life with extraordinary performances from the cast, most notably, Nicole Kidman and Stellan Skarsgård. I've never been a huge fan of Kidman but this film changed all of that. After every crippling defeat in the story she remains a quiet and controlled woman living among animals. Her low and soft voice really connected me to her and I felt that I needed to mentally support her throughout the film. I thought a film on a sound stage with no walls would take me out of the story but the opposite happened. It allowed the actors to explore their space and that let their performances really shine through without muddying it up with outside distractions. To contradict Kidman, Stellan Skarsgård plays the true ""human"" in the film. A real dog with survival ultimately guiding his way. He is a cold, almost emotionless animal that perfectly exemplifies the film's themes. He is the first of the town to obey his primal nature which begins a tailspin of incredibly deplorable acts from the rest of the townsfolk. Of course Kidman and Skarsgård are supported by the rest of the ensemble but their two performances really stood out for me.The only true gripe I had with Dogville was it's lack of Dogma 95-ness. It took place on a sound stage, with artificial lighting, and professional camera moves involving jibs and cranes. Now I don't believe taking away those elements would help the story, in fact it would do the opposite, but coming from Lars Von Trier I wanted to see a true Dogma 95 film. The film wouldn't have had the same effect of course but I just wanted to point out the fact that it broke many of the rules Von Trier helped establish. But what the film lacks in some areas of the Dogma, it makes up in a huge way. The bareness of the set is the real star of the film and in my opinion is the overwhelming factor in it's uniqueness of how to tell a story. So in that respect, Dogville aligns with the Dogma rules and uses them in such an eloquent way that it amazed me throughout the entire length of the film. The themes presented, along with the stunning performances and use of the Dogma 95 rules, Lars Von Trier's beautifully scripted and performed journey into what makes us human changed my entire perception of what a film could be and do and showed me the importance of pulling back the curtain.",Dogville
400,engin43,Extraordinary,8,30 August 2013,"Filmed in a theater set, no real objects except the characters but very successful however. The movie is very surprising by the keen changes of the all characters' attitudes against and thoughts about the strange visitor came to their little town in need. İn time, they show every malicious behaviors and thoughts which they had repressed for a long time. Shortly, it can be said that the movie has a pessimistic look on the human nature. May be it's also the reality on earth. İn fact, we all acting in our lives and not genuine to each other, only waiting the right time to show our real faces.

The underlying story is packed with drama but the movie itself lacks impact until the very end. The dialogue is often insipid, the narration didactic and hectoring as though the the writer/director wanted to be the star of the show as well as its creator. Only Nicole Kidman's outstanding performance kept me awake for the entire (nearly) three hours.Anti-American? Had Dogville been set in (say)a Turkish village (or had all the characters been Jewish) the director would have been run out town by the same people who heaped praise on him. I'm not an American, nor have I ever been, but there seems to have been no reason to set this story explicitly in America (especially since Lars von Trier has never been there and has no special knowledge of the place) other than to imply that American people are intrinsically more corrupt than the rest of us.

403,levgan,Overrated,3,30 July 2003,"First of all, I like Lars Von Trier and I'm a big fan of almost all his films I've seen. Even ""Dancer In The Dark"", being more the Bjork's showcase than Trier's masterpiece, still bears a stamp of genius.However, here's an absolutely different story. While ""Dancer..."" has been a wonderful and pretty controversial attempt of making people seeing the film look as the Pavlov's dogs (can one keep from weeping watching Selma's death I wonder?), ""Dogville"" tries to elicit the same hysterical reaction from the average beholder, but fails to do so. Perceiving this movie as a simple debunking of rotten American life would be too narrow and stupid, but as a global philosophical issue about putrescense of human civilization it also looks rather trite and undeveloped (Ulrich Seidl's ""Hundstage"" is the best example of this kind of social pamphlet). So where's the idea? I'm afraid that nowhere at all. I'm not insisting that any film must have a philosophical point in it, but since the director conciously gives up any special effects or decorative grandeur (narrowing the scene to a rather schematic little city), he must offer something instead. In this particular case Trier's formal minimalism gives no dividends on a compositional level. And the final realistic close-ups with bleeding children and screaming women look like a part of another movie. Not only ""Dogville"" lacks integrity and sense of proportion, it most of all lacks creativity and thus turns out a strong disappointment.",Dogville

What worked for me is the voice of the narrator which is still stuck in my head. Also the themes are wonderful--understanding our humanity, inhumanity and our limits. The execution of the concept works too. However the movie is too long. It belabors the idea of human nature being a little more complicated then we'd like to admit. There is something about it that makes me feel as if everyone involved in the production is trying too hard.

407,andrewdunn,The great dane left us a pile of dogCRAPville,1,10 April 2004,"I have seen `Dogville,' I have thought about `Dogville,' and now I am ready to comment on `Dogville.'But first, let's go back three years ago when I saw `Dancer in the Dark.' This was my first Lars Von Trier film and I loved it. I loved the way he merged a dogma film with a Technicolor musical and surprisingly, made it work. I loved Bjork. Her performance as Selma was brilliant and her haunting musical numbers embedded themselves in my mind forever.The fact that Lars set that film in the U.S. didn't bother me. After all, the scenes of the American judicial system were so fictitious; it was impossible to take them seriously. Also, `Dancer in the Dark' was part of a trilogy that also included films set in Scotland (`Breaking the Waves') and Denmark (`The Idiots'). But Lars apparently did have a problem when some U.S. critics questioned why he set the movie in the U.S. - a country he's never been to and says he's afraid to visit. Lars, in response, decided to make a new trilogy called `U.S.A.: Land of Opportunities' and `Dogville' is the first in this trilogy. I remember him saying that the Americans made `Casablanca' and never went there. I don't know how true that is but `Casablanca' wasn't a movie about Morocco and its people whereas `Dogville' is about America according to Lars Von Trier's imagination.Like `Dancer in the Dark' and `Breaking the Waves,' `Dogville' has an innocent female (Nicole Kidman) persecuted by the people around her. But, the comparisons stop there. Unlike the previous films, `Dogville' is pretentious, overlong and just plain unlikable.The story concerns a beautiful fugitive (Grace) who seeks refuge in a small American hamlet called Dogville. A no-talent philosopher/writer named Tom Edison convinces the close minded, dumb townspeople to let Grace stay and in exchange, she'll help everyone out with various chores. When wanted posters go up, the townspeople decide to up their demands on Grace and soon she is turned into a slave. The townspeople later proceed to rape, scapegoat and degrade her. Grace is a good person and continues to forgive their brutality until the end when judgment day arrives. This narrated fable stretches out for three edious hours on a nearly bare soundstage.On the positive side, the soundstage is a nice technique. Having a small town represented by chalk lines and minimal props is an interesting way to show the claustrophobic nature of hamlets where everyone knows everyone and everyone's business. Also, sacrificing sets and locations did allow Von Trier to afford an impressive cast including Nicole Kidman, Lauren Bacall, Stellan Skaarsgard, James Caan, Patricia Clarkson and more.On the downside, the actors' time is wasted on long-winded, pretentious dialog. Surprisingly, other than Stellan, the rest of the acting isn't very good. Scenes that should be emotional or passionate are just monotone. Even Nicole seems bored with her role. The camera work is lame and irritating. Worst of all, the length of the movie is inexcusable; there is no reason why this movie needed to be three hours!As an American, I have to speak up and say that I took offense to this film. I've read in several publications where Lars is now saying this film takes place in America but could easily take place in any small town, anywhere in the world. This is a contradictory and a cowardly thing for him to say; Von Trier took every step to make sure this town was American. This movie is nothing more than a mean-spirited attempt to paint the United States and its people as hypocrites.",Dogville

410,cagaj,Food for thought,9,13 November 2003,"Make no mistake:this is not just another movie, where you can sit down in the theater and switch your brain to stand-by mode. You should come prepared, as if you were going to see a theater play. Because that`s what it really is:a stage with hardly any props or background, no neat visual effects, and tons of dialogue to develop the story. 3 hours of constant attention are required. This sure sounds like it`s a good piece of work to watch this movie, so you may ask yourself:why do it then? The answer is simple:it`s one of the best stories you will find this year outside of a book.... The story of Grace (Nicole Kidman) who is a mob refugee and ends up in the probably most remote town on this planet, Dogville, solely lives on the slow and frighteningly real change the people of Dogville and Grace go thru. From the earnest, hard-working rural folk that are won over by Grace`s earnest attempts to be worthy of their hospitality, they step by step are corrupted by the most vicious of all feelings-the feeling of having power over someone. Soon all their dark desires and surpressed feelings of inferiority surface, and they start abusing poor Grace physically and emotionally, simply because finally they can. It`s a comment on human nature, and the result isn`t very pretty. Lars von Trier cleverly decided to have no walls on the stage, so while Grace is violated by an honorary member of the village, the audience at the same time watches the others doing their everyday business-but they should know? Yes, they DO know-but they don`t mind...Especially the role of the self-proclaimed local artist is a rather nasty comment on the way artists` neglect the individual`s horror during horrible times in their self-absorbed search for the big picture of human nature and psychology....But in the end a huge surprise is waiting for the ""good"" people of Dogville, when they decide to finally get rid off Grace, this subversive element endangering their small society`s peace, things don`t go exactly the way they planned... and now it`s for Grace to decide what to do when you have the power and consequently the responsibility to make changes for the better..... It`s not an easy movie to watch, being familiar with the working ethics of von Trier sure helps-and then you will be surprised that he actually decided to alter some of his Dogma rules to make this the best possible movie, and not let them become obstacles by blindly clinging to them. Probably Dogville is his most easily accessible movie yet, though it`s visualization may seem awkward to the occasional moviegoer, this time he has a strictly sequenced story to tell and a message to bring across (though it`s an arguable one).... Dogville is a most interestingly filmed and fascinating study of human nature and what horrors lurk behind the clean surface, waiting to be unleashed...... Without having to rely on blood,explosions or fancy bullet-time effects, von Trier created images that will stick with you-because he has done what all good moviemakers should do-aim for your head, not just for your eyes.",Dogville
411,ad_nauseum81,an allegory of staggering proportions,9,23 March 2004,"Many critics in the United States have pilloried this movie, accusing its creator of anti-Americanism. But such paranoid jibes completely miss the point: although Dogville is set in Depression-era Colorado, it really could be any place, any time. The tagline reads ""A quiet little town not far from here"", and the sparse stage set reinforces that point. The viewer's imagination is meant to fill in the gaps, making Dogville their home town for nearly three hours.Dogville is a troubled place where damaged folks nurse their own private woes. So when Grace (Nicole Kidman) arrives, seeking shelter from pursuing gangsters, the natives are reluctant to help. With the assistance of local 'philosopher' Tom Edison (Paul Bettany), she eventually persuades the inhabitants to relent, and they grant her a two week trial period. During the fortnight, she manages to win the villagers over by performing good deeds, but gradually they begin to take advantage of her kindness and the rot sets in.This is an extremely long film, but it is definitely worth the effort. An allegory of staggering proportions, it deals with virtually every aspect of humanity and some of the most fundamental questions people can face, whilst maintaining a lightness of touch that makes the mental workout more than bearable. If that's not enough, Dogville is also home to some great supporting characters, played by the likes of Lauren Bacall and Chloë Sevigny, whilst John Hurt's narration is simultaneously whimsical and profoundly moving.So empty the tank, keep a drink in reserve, and settle down for 178 minutes of cinematic genius.",Dogville

Acting is superb, and the dialogue in the car between Grace and her father is for me one of the most striking scenes in the film history.

I'm a young man in college that doesnt get himself wrapped up in these politics so my word is totally unbias. But honestly, it's boring. I watched it with a couple friends and if it wasnt for the 24 pack in fridge everyone would have fell asleep. Besides the constant rapings and the end Dogville well is Dog****. Do yourself a favor and dl or rent, hell even buy something like Lost in Translation, or Monster, or 21 grams as they will provide a way more entertain experience then Dogville 1 out of four stars",Dogville
414,Introspective,A disturbing but profoundly intriguing film,8,20 March 2004,"A disturbing but profoundly intriguing film of both great excellence and intense discomfort. In an examination of small town mentality and the affect forgiveness and ignorance can have on the frailty of human nature, Nicole Kidman plays her part with great proficiency and power. With a remarkable ensemble cast, all of which use there immense talent to portray difficult roles, of which require great skill, a feeling of unease creeps throughout the three hour duration of this film. The closing chapter does to seem to ease this somewhat with a powerful act of revenge by Grace (Kidman), but still a bitter taste is left when the film closes. Not the contrived and conceitedness found in other works by von Trier, but the final upbeat irony of the closing credits does echoes his deliberate audacity. A fine piece of filmed theatre, made greater by the talents of Nicole Kidman.",Dogville
415,coyote-43,( Quality movie : subpar storytelling ),5,3 April 2004,"Ah, Dogville. What can I say about Dogville?THE GOOD: Dogville was very well made.  Lars von Trier is a magnificent director. The movie sort of had the feel of a stage play.  This was due largely, though not entirely, to the experimental set design, which was very simple, yet elegant.  In short, I loved the directing, acting, set design, costumes, special effects, and editing.THE BAD: I did not like the incredibly pretentious story. Yes, I like movies that make me cry.  However, this movie's attempt at manipulating my feelings was way too blatant for my taste.  Dogville was a formulaic ""show the good and happy exterior and then show the dark and ugly underbelly"" movie, where the main character's suffering was not to make the story interesting as much as to make the story ""art"".  The message was not only a cynical outlook on human nature, but on any attempts to deny the dark side of human nature.  I loved the ending, which was also cynical.  Dogville had a great ending.  The ending did not make up for the rest of the movie.THE UGLY: The hardships of the main character start out reasonable, but become more and more ridiculous as the movie progresses until they no longer even seem plausible. I mean, our hero is raped by everyone in the movie at least twice.RATING: 3 out of 5",Dogville
416,ancharwashere,"Great play, not so great movie",6,2 May 2004,"Normally, I thoroughly dislike plays, I hate the artificial feel of it, but this movie has to be the best play I have ever seen. That is not so much criticism as observation. Every scene takes place on one indoor set, the size of a stage. This set houses the complete village of Dogville. The set is like a blackboard with the set pieces, from a dog to whole houses, chalked on the floor as if it were a map. There is only the occasional real set piece like a chair or a piece of wall. This makes the little village transparent. The black background makes the village look like it is alone in the cosmos. If all of this is meant to convey that this is a small, cramped, isolated village where little goes unseen: then it works. The price might be too high, though, for it feels very artificial and you are aware of it much to often. One, especially annoying, example of this is when actors have to open and close non-existent doors. Where I questioned the need for this mime, I hated the sound effects that went with it. The story is about a young, beautiful woman named Grace (Nicole Kidman) seeking refuge in an isolated and small village (about six houses and a church) during the depression. She claims to be sought by dangerous men but refuses to say anymore. ***POSSIBLE SPOILERS The town reluctantly adopts her as she turns out to be charming and willing to work for all of them. It is only when the village finds out that Grace is wanted by the police that they realise exactly how weak her position is. The people from the village start to exploit her, Grace has to endure this because she has no where else to go. END OF SPOILERS*** This movie is about power and the corruption that it brings. Just about all the individuals in this movie get, at some point, tested with an unhealthy amount of power over another individual. The question is how these individuals will hold. One gets the sense that the writer could have named this movie Ratville, as well. Indeed, he or she might have even called it Humanville thinking that would say more than enough, because this movie does paint a bleak picture of humanity. At this point I would like to say that before watching this movie I had heard that the director (Lars von Trier) had said that this movie was some comment on the US. The story is situated in a village in the US and that is how specifically American it got; the village, the people and their behaviour could have been anywhere. Von Trier obviously just yanked the chain of the Americans. If he had said this movie was about human nature nobody would have taken notice, by saying this was a comment on the US he made a big market curious. Because of the time and the country we can think von Trier hinted at the foreign policy of the US, in particular the invasion of  Iraq, which for some made little sense if exploitation of its vast oil riches was not taken in account. Fact is: he could have said this movie was a comment on any country at any given year and we would have found a reason why that would work at some level. To think that this movie is about the US is to be ignorant of other cultures, countries or just humanity as a whole. In the end, and I mean after you have seen the whole movie, it is not without satisfaction. The actors are great and so is the story. Extreme and even shocking things occur but you as a viewer get the chilling idea this is exactly how things could have gone. On the other hand, you have to wait almost three hours for this story to unfold and you could be excused for giving up on it half way through. The form in which the story is told is very daring (to have the magic of cinema at your fingertips and then to just chuck away half of its function is either brave or stupid). I can respect the experiment but I can not escape the feeling that it could also be a gratuitous show of rebellion by the director. As an experiment I can not say it was a success for I felt the form was too dominant, it is up to the individual viewer to look beyond that and some people might be better at it than others. I must come to the rather peculiar conclusion that, in the end, it is quite a good movie but I could not really recommend seeing it: 6 out of 10.",Dogville
417,ItsNotJust-a-flick,Brilliant study of human psychology,5,8 April 2015,"This film is completely packed with symbols and it should be perceived in that way. Those who are insulted with its content on the surface have apparently missed all the depth of this work of art.People are just imperfect, that is the point the film is trying to make. We can even poetically say that evil lays in every person, and when circumstances allow us, we will sometimes react as animals led by our passions. What happened in numerous wars especially during the 20th century is the best illustration of this thesis. Even the character of a young philosopher and writer on human morality, Tom Edison, who is not like others in the beginning, gave up and started to manifest his own bad manners. It is an interesting fact that the more people are doing immoral deeds, the more they are acceptable for them.So we are all gray, nothing is black and white – and terrible crimes can happen literary everywhere. It contradicts common good guys/bad guys Hollywood philosophy, and good nations/bad nations politicians' doctrine, which is often an excuse for killing people and starting a war.From the beginning of the film, Grace refuses to accept the truth about human imperfection and, instead of that, escapes in her fictional heaven and collects figurines as a proof that she really found one. But, that idea, colliding with reality, is as fragile as the ceramic figurines when they are smashed into the ground. Grace acts childishly until the very end, when she realizes there is the dark side of the town and decides to behave in accordance with it.",Dogville
418,Iwouldtakethebullet,Beautiful!,10,24 January 2005,"***Possible Spoilers*** A lot of critics loved this movie, just as a lot of critics hated it. I was drawn to this movie because I had heard that it was Nicole Kidman's greatest performance. I heard this not from a movie critic, but from a Nicole hater. The Nicole hater was right; Nicole Kidman delivers what, I believe, to be one of the greatest performances by an actress, ever. She is close to tears throughout most of the movie, just as her character, Grace, would be.The movie is about Grace, who flees gangsters and ends up in a small town, Dogville. At first she is greeted with kindness-townsfolk refuse to allow her to help them work, they give her gifts upon her supposed departure, etc. It is, however, only a short time until the townsfolk bare their teeth. They exploit her, abuse her, even force her to walk around with an iron chain attached to her neck!The movie is beautiful, perfectly acted, and wonderfully written. John Hurt's narration is not obnoxious as in other movies, but quite endearing. You may not like this movie, but it is worth seeing.",Dogville

I found nothing inspiring. The dialog was boring. The choices given the characters were inconsequential.The movie continued to undrammatically plod along. Without dialog. Without change. Continuing a misogynistic sense of unforgiving single-mindedness.Truly this film represents nothing about reality. There are not choices. There is no drama. There is simple dullness, like a winter as viewed from another land. No investigation. No observation.Dullness ending in dullness.Don't bother unless you have the time to investigate dullness.There are so many better and more intriguing films made by people who truly want to interrogate and observe the human experience rather than trudge through a path so heavily travelled that tracks and soil have becoming inhuman and unrecognizable as those from our planet.",Dogville
421,Jofo1185,Beautiful writing and directing,9,18 July 2006,"I came across this movie a while back, but I wasn't able to acquire it for some time due to its limited distribution. Finally I bought the movie on DVD, without any thought at all, and I have to say that it was amazing. The writing and the style that was used ie. play like features, had me going throughout the entire almost 3 hour long film.The story of a woman running from her trouble to a small town in rural-town, USA is not new to many of us. But the look upon the effect in which Grace has on the town folk is very interesting.I myself am American and took no offense to the ideas of greed, hate, and downright self loathing of each other. This in a sense is us. America was created by violence and most likely will be destroyed by the same thing. I'm quite interested in seeing a documentary on what Americans believe what the ""American Life"" is truly about and in turn seeing what non-Americans think as well. This movie is coming from a non-American and its quite obvious how he feels about us.Even then though, the acting is wonderful. The concept is something I haven't seen before. And the writing is as I said before wonderful. See this movie you won't regret it.",Dogville
422,skjeldal,"A statement on morality, or our lack of it",10,15 May 2005,"Once again, Lars Von Trier, has presented us with a thought-provoking and disturbingly honest account of the human condition. To my mind, the main message related to the incredible amount of cognitive energy we humans will expend in attempting to prove to ourselves that we are not subject to the 'hard wired' behaviours that make us human. Some will go to great lengths to avoid seeing this in themselves and in others, and will justify behaviours that they believe are immoral and unethical on the basis of causal life events.At times, it is necessary to state that something is just not acceptable, and to hold others accountable to the same standards to which we attempt to strive. This involves making a personal decision regarding what will be tolerated, an action that requires courage and honesty. Although we differ with regard to how much of our 'true selves' we are prepared to display, and some will require extreme provocation before they will 'revert to type' (Grace, for example), in the end we will behave in a self-centred and ultimately self-sustaining manner.It seems that we just can't accept that we, in the same manner as all other species, will ensure that we always have our needs met. Morality may simply be an acceptable word for the attempts we make to have others conform in a manner that meets our needs. Who can say? Each time I watch one of his movies, I think that he will never be able to make a better movie next time. And he always proves me wrong.",Dogville
423,zhengtonglu,I can ensure you that it never occurred to me once that this is a film about America.,10,24 July 2015,"I've seen so many review said that this film is sarcastic about American and that they felt hurt and shameful. But as a Chinese, I can ensure you that it never occurred to me once that this is a film about America.And I feel shameful too, not because it is American, but rather the film talks about the feature of all human being. If the setting is a Chinese town, I wouldn't be surprised.Just see Dogville as a lab for experiments.However,it seems that a lot people agree with the ending of the film where Grace killed them all and felt that the elimination of Gogville will make the world a better place. But this is where I disagree. See, anger and shame will do no good. Revenge and killing will only lead to war and make it all worse. We must see what happened in Dogville in a relative perspective, find a pattern in similar problems, and work out a device to prevent them from happening again. But first thing first, we should admit that it is highly possible for every one of us to behave exactly like the residents in Dogville. People are born sinful, with flaws in nature, and I admit it myself. There is a saying by Confucius :Inequality rather than want is the cause of trouble. I think it renders the problem here perfectly. Before Grace's presence there was a balance in the town and every one was OK with what they got, despise poverty. But after Grace showed up, the balance was broken. The residents needed to scarify a sense of security to shelter Grace. In return Grace offered her labour. For a moment the balance resumed, but precariously. Can you see a change of state of mind when the residents accept her offer? At that moment their mercy and Crace's gratefulness turned into a bare transaction.Ever since none of the two parties was grateful to each other's help, but rather taking it for granted. So when the cops showed up, which implied that the residents need to scarify more to shelter Grace, the balance was broken again. No one ever hesitated to ask for more from Grace, and as a result, Grace didn't have the time and energy to fulfill her work, which arose their anger and sense of inequality even more. The situation went to a extreme ever since. The incentive mechanism was wrong in the first place.Was there pure evil in Dogville? Well maybe, but it was reasonably triggered. We can also detect a loss of law and authority to prevent crime. Because Grace was chased after law and authority in the first place,law did't apply to her. Here we can also draw a conclusion that pure democracy can sometimes lead to pure evil when not properly restricted by law. At the end Grace shot them all to death. And I am surprised to find so many in favor of her. Isn't this the biggest sarcasm in this film? Grace is so arrogant that she started a experiment only to prove she was right. However the experiment proves that she was totally wrong about human being and people everywhere were exactly the same.However she refused to admit her failure, but found a excuse that the people in Dogville were simply not good enough, so she killed them all to make the world a better place. Or rather she actually admitted her failure and found out that human beings are evil in nature, so she decided to let go of herself and become a spokewoman of evil. Either is hardly a good way to solve problem and make the world better, aren't they? If Grace goes to a Catville to do this again. My advice is: never dream of paying them back by your honest labour. When people decided to help you, they would like to see your venerability, so that they can feel good and accomplished. Show your capability when you are in a safer position.",Dogville
424,locustsday,Somebody needs to give Lars a cupcake,2,13 August 2005,"This is a truly nihilistic and pretentious film. The minimalist approach is taken to the extreme with disastrous results.The film is preachy, ugly and worst of all dull as a doorknob. While a bit of a knucklehead, Von Trier can usually pull out some interesting performances. The abundant narration found here poorly compensates for an underdeveloped cast. What's even more baffling is the film's length, clocking in a hair under 3 hours. This film, so dedicated to breaking down the proverbial 3rd wall, offers characters all following the logic of slasher film and looney Tune fodder. In my opinion this overinflated gasbag of a film is coasting on the Fumes of a once compelling director, turned moralist dullard.",Dogville

I have no qualms about the artsy theatrical sets.However, the story is either totally illogical or massively biased allegory.The main protagonist is charming, beautiful, sweet, and is used and abused by literally everyone she meets. There is not one positive character other than Kidman's in this movie. Is that the film makers view of how America treats the immigrant, the poor and weak? Maybe, there may even be an element of truth to that, but there are no moral people in America? If that is the films message then I feel that the movie signifies a risible level of self-indulgent on the part of the film maker.Finally, I could not help but feel that the abuses suffered by Kidman's character and her eventual 'revenge' looked like little more than an arted up 'I Spit On Your Grave'.",Dogville
426,ffc_home,"Hard to digest, but great.",9,28 August 2005,"Tough. Once again Lars von Trier tortures the audience (as he did previously on Dancer in the Dark) by upraising the darkest side of the human being. From the beginning you know that things can only get worse, but I doubt that one can figure out neither what's to come nor the powerful conclusion. Nicole Kidman's interpretation is perfect - intense, poignant, passionate, you name it. She is fantastic and so is the small cast locked inside Dogville's scenario (a wonderful creation - I wonder how something so simple can bring such a strong effect). Again, the entire cast is fantastic and for that goes an extra credit for Lars von Trier. His capability of pushing actors to the limit and extracting painful emotions from them creates a heavy atmosphere, full of tension and, at the same time, so familiar. It is not that Dogville represents the essence of our communities, but it exposes some aspects of our lives that we prefer to hide under the carpet.",Dogville

Hopefully without spoolers: fantastic acting by all, not only Kidman (the lack of decors makes that only more noticeable), but what really makes it outstanding is the build-up to a very strong - but painful - conclusion. It is impossible not to relate with our antagonist and it will keep you thinking about questions like: ""Does it pay off to be good?"", ""How do we define good"", ""can one sparrow bring the spring""? This topic comes back in the related title Manderlay as well, but especially strong in this unforgettable movie.",Dogville
428,mimiandme,A must for film fans,7,29 March 2007,"When you first begin to watch Dogville it does take you back, it is shocking that the whole film will take place on this sound stage where the buildings are made up of white lines on the black stage floor. The first shot of Dogville the town in like a map, we look down on it from a birds eye view where we clearly see the road running up the middle (clearly named as Elm Street with the letters painted directly onto the floor) and the houses that surround it. There are no doors except one, very few walls except the one on the church hall which is still only 2 metres wide and even a dog is portrayed by an outline on the floor.This type of staging is interesting at it is visible Trier has been highly influence by the playwright and theatre director Bertolt Brecht. Brecht's techniques were to alienate the audience and it is clear that this is Trier's intention in Dogville. Even though the acting in extremely natural and even the sound effects of doors opening and closing can bring a fresh look at film making today.Trier is very daring and i believe that the film is stunning and the set designer (even if it is Trier)should have received more recognition. It is unlike any other film you will see (other than Manderlay) and a must for all film fans.Myself being a film and theatre student, i found this film extremely helpful in understanding Brecht.

Not so, i was hooked within the first 10 minutes. The story is set in a small Depression era town. Grace, played by Nicole Kidman, enters Dogville to escape gangsters. The town, led by Tom agree to let her stay. Grace earns her keep by doing chores for the townsfolk and for a while this is agreeable to all. This changes with the arrival of police looking for Grace and a few incidents between Grace and the townsfolk. As a result, Tom decides Grace needs to perform more chores in less time to repay the community's 'kindness'. The darker side of the town emerges as Grace is treated as a physical and sexual slave, her voice and her autonomy is removed. Retribution becomes inevitable. This film is an acutely observed insight into the darker side of human nature. It isn't an easy film to watch for this reason. How can an act of charity lead to such depraved behaviour? The key ingredients of vulnerability and lack of self awareness enable the downward spiral into extreme forms of cruelty. A very powerful film.",Dogville

My growing love for this directors work is much like discovering that you've fallen in love with the girl you keep running into at the grocer's. ""Breaking the waves"" left me with the feeling of having been beat up emotionally, and every Trier movie I've seen have moments when it feels like a hand tears open my chest and pull my still beating heart out. The snapshot ""Dogville"" offers of human frailty and cruelty fueled by fear resolved heaps of unsolved questions left by four years of studies in the time it takes to get through three lectures of philosophy, psychology and sociology. It's good to see the betrayal intellectuals are committing every day towards the oppressed that trust them exposed in a movie for once, although Von Trier hints at the dubious connection between himself and himself just to prove how hard it is to tell. It's been said that the trilogy by Von Trier is an exploration of the Christ-figure in a near-contemporary setting, and I'd dare say there's a better introduction to religion in this movie than in the bible itself.

I will remember it like I remember the worst of bad dreams. The grandeur of this movie which I rated 10 of 10 lies within the outrageous rate of horror it slowly creates within while the story develops. To me it's the best horror movie of all times. Unlike the cheap masquerades with vampires it really scares. It scares deep because it's real. The worst horror lies within people.Praise for movie crew had been written here already. The moral lessons of the story observed. I would not put it any better.I would only comment on anti-USA topic. I had not the slightest clue who was the director until afterwards. I did not like his previous movies (I saw Dancer and few episodes of The Kingdom). I had no idea of his political agenda until I read reviews.IMHO this movie is about USA as much as The Caucasian Chalk Circle by Bertolt Brecht is about the countries located in Caucasian mountains. Many years ago I saw this drama (which is widely referenced in the movie btw) performed by artists from Georgia (incidentally it's really Caucasian country). I didn't get a single word as it was performed in their language and the only translation available was in brochure, however it was one of the most memorable shows I ever saw. Apparently these people had not got is as major offence that the dramatists selected their country for his story.
And now remove the USA from Dogville and place the action somewhere else; say unidentified European country (like the one I am from). What would change in the movie then? Nothing, absolutely nothing. Regardless of creator's intentions this movie has no `geography'. It's about dogvilles in my country and in all neighboring countries.This movie will be remembered for very long time. As long as human nature remains as it is. Not many people like when they are reminded of their own sins that's why this movie won't be loved by crowds.I recommend this movie for open minded folks only.

Her final enslavement and abuse is much like the treatment of the poor- illegal immigrants, 'po' white trash', ghetto dwellers etc of any place- and time.

Three hours is too little time for the magnitude of the subject, and the result only shows the efficiency of Lars Von Trier as Director. LVT illustrates the main male character, Tom, illustrating ourselves through life, the motivations we have for choosing to do one thing or the other, the justification for our acts that we give to others and to ourselves.The imagery (light, darkness, changing seasons) and the use of sounds (bell, barking, gun shots, unidentified sounds) are very Chekhovian. With, of course, the necessary addition of a more active plot in concordance with our times and the cinematic medium. The acting is superb, spontaneous and precise (and masterfully edited). Nicole Kidman as Grace is a gem. I must say I did not realize that Lauren Bacall (Ma Ginger) and James Caan (The Big Man) were in the film until the credits at the end! There is a rape scene, performed within the transparent walls of a house, which is a stroke of grace (no punch line intended) and most illustrative, to say the least. I also enjoyed the whole business of Grace's frustration at not having anything to do in exchange for the hospitality and the solution found to overcome this by doing things that people didn't do because they found unnecessary! My two reservations are the photo montage at the end, and the vengeance/punishment scene firstly performed by Vera, one of Dogville's townsfolk, and then mirrored most violently by Grace at the very end.On the whole, a memorable and provocative film.",Dogville

And it is dark, but also very involving. You can't help but put yourself in Graces shoes, and suffer the indignities with her. This is Triers genius; he makes you welcome what happens at the end although it is very shocking.I thought Dogville was very good indeed, it makes you FEEL something, which is the ultimate test for a film. However the sound stage style seemed to get in the way of the story rather than intensifying it, the Peter Greenaway inspired narrative was pretentious and the occasional hand-held video camera sequences don't have that documentary/reality show feel that Trier was obviously after...",Dogville
441,longloft,One of my favorites,10,18 October 2006,"Nobody exposes the infinite permutations of the human con better than Von Trier. The hypocritical subtext of human life is made main text in this work. Everything is in relief, stark, relentless. Casual cruelty and duplicity are the norm. It's how people ""get by"" and ""entertain themselves."" Nearly everyone in the story is a cunning animal squirreling away nuggets and crumbs of whatever they think is valuable and exclusively theirs. Everyone hoards. Everyone is looking for a ""favor"" but when they get it they are always disappointed. It really is dog eat dog in Dogville. I was completely captivated by this little nightmare and think that time will ultimately be very kind to it. It is a masterpiece. E.M. Long",Dogville

At first I was a little skeptical of her, but then I saw she was both sweet and sensible for helping the other villagers for their risk of hiding her. As the villagers took advantage of her more and more (raping her, accusing and framing her, alienating her, abusing her), I wasn't only becoming disgusted at the villagers, but I was becoming frustrated and incredulous of how forgiving and ""nice"" she was. I know she had faith and forgiveness for people, but honestly, what was her limit? Did she even have one? Or would she just stand by until someone got so jealous or angry that they killed her as easily as they raped her? I kept thinking she should just defend herself, for Tom or anyone else wasn't going to.When the cars came, I wanted the villagers to get some sort of punishment and retribution. I wanted Grace to stand up for herself. I know other people watching wanted that as well. The ending, however, which consisted of everything burning and everyone being shot, was definitely not the type of punishment I had wanted for the villagers. I was shocked at how suddenly she changed and let power consume her and how quickly her whole personality and philosophy of faith and forgiveness just snapped. In the end I guess it made sense. She realized her limit when her dad talked with her, and she just snapped. I was proud and appalled at her by the end of the movie.",Dogville

I mean, after 10 minutes you got used to it and then you only wait 163 minutes for Jimmy Caan.Lars von Trier made wonderful movies. This is not one of them.

450,oncomms,Wonderful film... don't really think there is spoiler material here but am being cautious,10,21 June 2007,"I came by this film a bit late; my reluctance to see this stemmed from the discomfort I felt when watching both 'Breaking the waves' and 'Dancer in the dark' by the same director. In each case, I questioned the necessity of the suffering the women protagonists were subjected to. I am prepared to consider I might be wrong but it was a gut reaction.Dogville is a movie that that I consider to be masterpiece standing but I can also appreciate the comments of those who found it inaccessible. For me it was engaging,thought provoking and emotive, touching on some uncomfortable truths about human nature, the behaviour of groups and how we sometimes justify our exploitation of others.The device of using a theatre format rather than a 'realistic' set is no gimmick. It adds so much, showing us the ugliness of a scene in parallel with the everyday life continuing its course. It is symbolic of not only what we do not see but also of what we choose not to see.Possibly the finest performance I have seen from Nicole Kidman who plays the enigmatic Grace. She stumbles into town on the run and has a secret that makes her vulnerable. Grace's would be saviour and 'champion' Tom, is a writer-in-waiting, a dreamer and the self-proclaimed philosopher of the little town of Dogsville. Mired by his own self-obsession he sees the town and their visitor as something for him to manipulate for the greater good. It is his own cowardice that gives him the most problem; he cannot face the human in himself or bear to consider that he is flawed. When he is forced to question his motivations, carnal desire and integrity, it seems to him that he has to cleanse himself and the town of the problem.Grace does not question the mistreatment she has experienced at the hands of the people of Dogsville; she is empathic, understanding and clings to her 'new' life despite hardship. However, Grace's past is in hot pursuit, forcing her to wrestle with her own nature and the balance between justice and forgiveness.",Dogville

Not so with ""Dogville"". It IS an experiment, it IS highly stylized, but it is also a disturbing and unique dive into the darkest sides of human nature - be it American or not!",Dogville
452,guykamen,Dogville or Springfield? Swings Either Way.,1,12 April 2004,"I had a couple of drinks, and so was able to sit through Dogville. In my semi-addled state I thought I was watching a rejected episode of The Simpsons. But a half hour into the show, something told me I wasn't watching any crackpot NBC cartoon at all. Why? Because I was hard pressed to identify any Marge Simpson character. Well one can argue that the Paul Bettany character is somewhat similar to an unconscientious Marge, but I digress, because: WHERE THE &#%$ THEN IS BART AND LISA SIMPSON, HUH?Well I still enjoyed the show, if only for the performance of the actors all across the board. The camerawork however, put me in a virtual shitstorm. I thought I was reliving Die Hard III, which to me was nigh impossible for anyone to sit through. That is, unless motion sickness makes you go ""wheeee"" or ""yee-haw"".
These days, any two-bit hack television writer can work out character development. That's only primetime drama. But this is the big screen. It takes a writer with real cajones to come up with characters you can simply switch off your EQ for. But for whatever the middle portion lacks, it's more than made up for towards the end of the show, when--like a sendup to Star Wars Episode 1's ""Wipe them out, all of them,"" down comes an Armageddon, the likes of which can only be found in the Persian Gulf. Blowing things up makes people happy. So that's a no-brainer.No doubt the effect is supposed to shock, abhor, or for the deadened or hardened, vaguely titillate. But to me, it's good enough to be another filler episode of The Simpsons.No stars. I don't believe in rating shows in reviews.",Dogville

On the contrary, they will rather surprisingly maximise the effect...A fence, a car, a white chalk line, all of a sudden they can become extremely threatening.

I wish that film makers would make more movies like that. Dogville explores the human soul at length, for better or worse. It was a beautiful portrayal of a girl growing into a woman and leaving her naiveté behind. Yes, there are people like Tom and Chuck and Vera in the world. Quite a few.

457,s-heisel-hv,Truth of Humanity,5,7 October 2009,"Directed and written by Lars Von Trier, the movie ""Dogville"" is based a small, pleasant, rural community in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. During the Great Depression, a girl named Grace, played by Nicole Kidman, flees from a neighboring city that is full of gangsters and violence. Met by Tom Edison, Jr., played by Paul Bettney, he devises a plan to help her get accepted among the heartfelt citizens of Dogville. She is considered a missing person and a criminal, and the people of this small town will not harbor her without a price. They say they have nothing to do, but work her hard to hide her among their tight knit community. With the police constantly coming into their town tensions rise to an all time high. They blackmail Grace and get everything they want out of her and keep her prisoner before turning her into the gangsters she had originally ran from. The ending unexpectedly gives Grace the power again, ending in a violent explosion of emotions.Lars Von Trier played on the fear of Americans during the Great Depression. He was either trying to expose the truth of humanity in a sense that we let authority control us; we are easily manipulated. The fact that we are suspicious of people we do not know even if they are from the same country or area. We are all capable to be selfish and violent people. For example the characters in this movie are more worried about money and revenge to such an extent as to torture, forgetting their moral and ethical values completely. The way that this movie was made was very low budget and filmed on a single stage. I love the way that he depicts the simple town in such a simple manor. I do not agree that the American population would go to such extremes with the hatred displayed in this movie. I also do not believe that we are inherently violent people, but being human we are easily corrupted by authority.",Dogville
458,tuktuk222,A masterpiece of social behavior and human psychology,10,27 October 2003,"Warning : SPOILERS AHEAD !!I found 'Dogville' very interesting. It is one of the few long gloomy movies I have liked so much. The most interesting part is the turn of events. How a small town in equilibrium gradually reaches catastrophe is shown marvellously, with everything happening very much according to human needs and psychology. An immigrant into a small town slowly finds her way into the people's hearts. But, in such a situation, everyone could not be satisfied for long. Things begin to worsen, which has been shown really well, starting from a child to an adult to an old man. Conditions are put forward for the safety of the immigrant, which brings us to the another very interesting part of the movie. How an immigrant who shall emotionally feel more secure at a new place as time passes is demanded of more, has been shown in a way, which looks very natural and thus appealing. One of the best scenes of the movie is towards the end, when Tom is shot by Grace herself. Tom was subtly responsible for all the miseries Grace had to face at Dogville, though he was the one to save her. One can argue on this matter, whether he was a criminal or not. I would term Tom as a criminal for being so nonchalant to the exploitation of Grace by the people. This is a powerful movie which shall definitely leave an impact on the world, before it is, if ever forgotten. I give it a full score for the direction, acting and the story which are all equally wonderful.",Dogville
459,mikestrman,A Masterpiece that should and will go down in history,10,2 February 2004,"Leading a strong year of films about to be released, Dogville was one feature I saw at the New York Film Festival in October of 2003, it was the most incredible film I have ever seen, it is a masterpiece in every aspect of film, and an accomplishment that no one except Von Trier and his brilliance could achieve, this man not only knows how to change every rule in film, and succeed at creating his own medium, but he is able to touch the soul of everyone human who lets this film sink into them.  Not only has he shown his strength as a director but also he has brought out the best in every cast member, and goes far beyond making his actors become the characters.  Nicole Kidman reaches a level performance that is unparalleled by any other performance ever put on screen.  She will be remembered for the rest of her life and after she dies, for this performance which defines her not only as an actor, but as a human.  Her performance in this film is the best ever put on screen by any actor, and it is with the help of Mr. Von Trier that she is able to create this story.  The rest of the cast is superb, and these are career performances for the likes of Paul Bentenny, and Patricia Clarkson, who makes your bones chill several times during this film.  The soundstage, which creates the intimacy between the characters and the audience, could not work any other way, and Mr. Von Trier has succeeded beyond the expectations of any film ever made.  This is truly The Masterpiece! *I cannot even rate this film for it is on a level without numbers",Dogville

I have seen all of Von Trier's other films, and loved them -particularly Breaking the Waves. This film is different again in its use of elements of theatre. Set on a stage, there is little to distract the audience from becoming deeply involved with the narrative, characters and dialog. I found it extremely compelling in the same way that a great book is hard to put down. I have watched this film 4 times in 24 hours and I almost can't bear to leave the emotional space in which it has put me. Many film makers have attempted to put forward similar viewpoints of America, but few have achieved it with such simplicity and clarity. It is a perfect 'illustration' .",Dogville

464,AcademyAwardWinningMe,Fantastic and Thought Provoking Film,10,11 April 2004,"Contains Spoiler My journey to Dogville proved to be a fulfilling one! I've seen a few films this year that constitute as `Oscar worthy'. Most notably Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Passion of the Christ (my least favorite of the Oscar Contenders).This film is most definitely not for anyone. People who enjoy the physical aspects of film more than the emotional will not find it as entertaining. While it is stunning, if not odd to look at, Dogville is rather devoid of sets. I actually found that rather beneficial to the film, though. The film's center was a town and it's people. And while it focused on Grace (brilliantly portrayed by Nicole Kidman), it was interesting to see the goings on of the town while influential situations took place around them-- mostly unbeknownst to them.The plot is surprisingly easy to follow, with dashes of humor and large doses of morality and drama. A beautiful young woman ventures into the town of Dogville, where the people mercifully take her in despite the fact that she is running from the mob. In return for their kindness, Grace begins performing odd jobs and the like for each of the few residents. She soon forms a romantic attachment to Paul Bettany's character, Tom Edison who is the chief moral character of the town. However, Grace's life in Dogville begins to crumble. The police often venture into Dogville looking for Grace; at first labeling her as missing and then as wanted for bank robberies that she did not commit. She is also raped by one member of the town. He continues to molest her and his wife, Vera, soon discovers this. She confronts Grace with other female citizens of the town and they seek punishment, not acknowledging that she is being raped. Her situation grows worse in Dogville and she attempts to escape with the help of Tom, however their co-conspirator in the escape betrays them both and simply returns Grace to Dogville. Also, Tom seems to be doubting Grace and in a way betrays her, as well. She continues to be abused while performing her forced labor until the dramatic and shocking conclusion.Sorry if my synopsis is less than informative, I've always been horrid at those!I would now like to focus on the performances. Paul Bettany was surprisingly good as Tom Edison. He portrayed his lustful respect and adoration for Grace beautifully and portrayed his inner conflicts well. I especially enjoyed Lauren Bacall's performance as a bitchy shop owner who's imperious ways divulged much of the entire town's persona. As usual, Patricia Clarkson delivered a fabulous performance though she had little time to do it. I loved how her character first appeared as kind and forgiving, but slowly manifested into a vindictive and jealous woman. And much to my relief, Kidman lives up to her fantastic reviews. She is able to display Grace's deep emotions without being too overly dramatic. In that sense, Grace seemed very real to me because she was devoid of dramatic and filled with truth. She also underwent a change, from being a virtuous and forgiving woman who did not realize her plight or the fact that she had been wronged to the woman who sought revenge. She delivers a beautiful, Oscar worthy performance. However, I could care less if she wins or is even nominated. In my opinion, her performance is so good that it doesn't need an Oscar to validate it. Of course, I'm sure a nomination or win is welcomed.
As for being Anti-America, it depends how you look at it. For some, such as Ebert and Roeper, it is anti-American but I ask why? I think that some people only need a shred of doubt toward America to make it snowball into something it is not, and Dogville has that shred. While it may not portray America in a glamorous light, it's still true to life. There are bad people everywhere, not just in America. I know I'm making no sense, but I can't quite describe how I feel on that subject. Perhaps I should put it this way. Dogville is every and any town in every and any country, and it shows that each place in the world deserved that shred of doubt.All in all, I highly recommend the film! Mostly because it needn't focus on the special effects or elaborate costumes because it has such glorious performances. It is a character study, and a fascinating one at that!",Dogville
465,stadi2003,A mind-boggling experience,10,11 October 2003,"Before watching this movie, I've heard of the anti-american words the director Lars van Trier and worried it might spoil the fun of it. This is because I wouldn't consider myself anti-american and don't like generalizations in general.You need not to worry. Once the play (which it is) began, I immediately became sucked into the story. To be able to see through a little town like this at any given time, the walls only markings on the stage, was really something.It's a overwhelming movie because this intensity of the story can only be achieved by a play, but you'll never be able to see a play in this detail and intimacy.",Dogville
466,tafroydis,This movie is SO overrated! (SOME SPOILERS!!),1,2 September 2003,"I really did not like this movie. I have followed Lars von Triers career for a long time, and have seen all his movies, and the only one i really enjoyed was RIKET (The Kingdom) and Breaking the Waves. What annoyed me about Dogville was a lot of things: The main thing is that it never really gets to me, i don`t feel anything while I see it. And Von Trier himself once said: ""Film er følelser"" or ""Films are feelings."" Dogville is surprisingly cold and it leaves a great distance between me and the characters. Another thing is the experiment in form. For those who havent seen it: It all takes place in the studio. The actors are in costume, but instead of streets, houses and trees and bushes there are markings on the floor that the actors were forced to relate to. The move through invisible doors, and you hear an invisible dog barking. Far away form his DOGME film THE IDIOT. It`s all very neat, but it all becomes very artificial. Which off course is why he did it. It all looks like a theatrical play that is being filmed, which is a thing i really hate. The story is ok, I was never really bored during this 3-hour movie, and the main reason for that is the wonderful actors. But if you come from Scandinavia you will find the story no more advanced than a Finnish tv-drama, filled with really evil people pretending to be nice, and the problems in small towns. Finnish tv-drama is an expression in these countries, and a genre Von Triers knows a lot about. But this kind of story demands an intimacy with the characters that you don`t get in Dogville. The theatrical appearance of the film creates a huge distance to the whole story, and the film falls between two chairs. It never moves or inspires. It just tells a long, long story, that frankly is not very believable, specially the ending, when we find out who Nicole Kidmans characters is, and she orders the whole village to be executed. A scene that never would have worked if Von Trier had uses film effects in stead of theatrical effects. It would have been to violent, and the N. Kidman character would have been even more difficult to swallow. The last thing that annoyed me during the entire film is John Hurts voice-over. He has a fantastic voice and presence in the film, but I hate it when a voice-over is telling me what I`m looking at. ""Now you`re seeing this, and now you`re seeing that!"" It is overstated the whole way through and it creates even more distance. All in all, a HUGE disappointment. Lars Von Triers experiment with the form of cinema fails big time. And I really feel a lot of people like this film just because it is weird and strange, and experimental. And I really feel sorry for the actors, see DOGVILLE CONFESSIONS and find out why. That doesn`t really matter, Hitchcock was terrible to his actors too. But go see it if you get the chance, find out what you think, I would love to discuss it, and as I said; the actors really save this movie from total failure.",Dogville

Mr. Ebert, I am a huge fan of yours and enjoy reading your reviews, after I have seen a movie. I just happened to pick up ""Dogville"" at my local library.

The film was superbly acted and shot and evokes the anger and discomfort typically associated with Lars' work. I don't think it's going to be too popular with Hollywood though the Dogvilles of all Dogvilles. Very interesting commentary on North American values.

470,bonashoon,"I was a ""love it"" person",10,18 April 2004,"Before I went to see this movie, I read that it is either a ""love it"" or ""hate it"" movie. I like all kinds of movies, from popcorn flicks to art house, from mindless to thoughtful. I was curious as to which side I fell into. I LOVED it. I don't know what more to say about the movie that others who loved it didn't already say. The only practical advice I have to give is this: please stay and watch the whole movie, no matter how difficult it gets. The hand-held camera made me nauseous, but after a while I got used to it. von Trier's intelligent camera work makes up for the sparse setting and it surprised me to note that though the movie was on a sound stage, with the mere help of light and sounds, there were so many beautifully ""scenic"" scenes. I realized also that though the setting was so basic, I believed that a town existed and could think of several towns that I have been in that ""looked"" like Dogville. No review would be complete without mention of the awesome cast and acting. You would have to have AMAZING acting for such an experiment to work, and it was the acting that brought it all together for me. I have always been a fan of Kidman, but she amazed me even more here. There was one scene in particular in which her acting convinced me that she is indeed one of the most talented actresses of our time. I knew a lot about this movie before I went to see it and was afraid that my knowledge would ruin it for me...make it boring. But I was so absorbed that the three hours went by surprisingly fast for me. I am aware that there are some people (and critics) who don't like this movie... in fact, hated it...and it's hard to know on which side you are going to fall. The only thing I can say is: go see this movie for yourself, you'd be surprised where you land.",Dogville
471,bestis,Very good movie,10,15 October 2003,"I think this is the best movie I have seen ever. It is very similar to ""Lilja 4-ever"". I didn't understand why some calls this film anti-America because it is universal this can happen anywhere anytime. For me, this film tells about person who has to live in new place, have to make all people love her. She is the best, but mission is impossible, even for her. For us this can be even harder. Actually it is. For foreigners who come to new country it's like this.",Dogville

473,Anas_Platyrhynchos,Is this a movie or what?,1,30 November 2007,"Think about it: Harold Lloyd, Chaplin and many others made great movies in twenties, despite of technological limitations of those days. Nevertheless they knew what a movie is or should be. They had a clear idea of a movie in their minds. That was the main thing: To understand what a movie is. Many other producers, directors etc. understood the concept as well. Akira Kurosawa got excellent shots with very minimal equipment. And so on. They understood movie and their audience understood them.Then I bought a ticket and went watching this Dogville thing. I went to a movie theater and paid a decent price because I expected to see a movie. Instead of a decent movie I saw lines painted on the floor, also a dog that was not actually a dog but just lines on the floor. Have you ever seen or heard about dog actors? I have. I suppose that shaky picture was intended to make audience seasick, and it almost did that. What about the sound space then? Narrator's voice tried to patch with words this unimpressive, boring, shaky and overpriced film. It also lasted too long. It could have been compressed into 15 minutes without losing anything essential.One star is quite enough for Dogville.",Dogville

475,skalle_per,Similar painfull watching as Lord of the Flies,9,11 November 2003,"With a similar emotional impact as Lord of the Flies, von Trier takes it a step further. He does not attribute his metaphoric story to children, but lets it play among adults, adults in a society. He applies the societal problem on an already existing society and makes it impossible for the viewer not to cast at least some form of reflection on their own surrounding.From time to time, the movie was predictable and somewhat over-obvious in the onstage plot. Never the less, an important movie. It does not moralize, it does not provide a solution. Hence the beauty of the story. The final chapter gives the plot it's true twist, and here the viewer is forced to confront the dilemma of the characters. Forced. The viewer will pass judgement. Not von Trier. (And despite previous partial predictabilities in the movie the development was the contrary).",Dogville
476,ashleylocke10,An annoying woman moves to an annoying town.,1,4 October 2011,"This movie was the most torturous 3 hours of my existence. The idea of having no set could work, if the movie had a plot that was actually interesting. Instead, we are forced to indulge in a set-less, plot less waste of time. It was so terrifyingly awful that I managed to take a nap during the movie. And, after napping, I didn't feel as if I'd missed anything of importance. Spend your 3 hours on something worth seeing, not this piece of garbage by a French director who had never even been to the United States. If you are going to make a film about a country, it would be a good idea to visit it. It was nothing like depression era U.S. It was not even like a movie. It was absolutely atrocious.",Dogville

I like Von Trier and i knew i would see a good movie when i gave my 7 euros, i just didn't know it would be this good! Comparable to the classical plays of ancient Greece! It gives us the spark to discover our nature and accept it, get to know ourselves so as to understand the others! So true that comes near to perfection!",Dogville
478,prophecyboy,"Emotional, though provoking and GOOD",10,22 October 2004,"*******SPOILERS*****First time I saw this movie I had no idea what it was about. I had not seen the trailer or read any reviews or even knew about the 'location'. I had seen the DVD for sale online and liked the blurb and heard the name 'Trier' a few times and loved Kidman so I decided to rent this. I loved it.First of, the first thing you'll notice is the setting. With the DVD menu and opening few seconds I thought it was a CGI gimmick to introduce us to the town so I skipped a head a few chapters. After the initial shock I got used to it and fell totally in love with the way this movie was shot. It is so perfect, even now I can't believe that they actually made this move and they made it like they did. It is perfect in that way.The story is very very good, always affecting and sometimes disturbing and 99.9% well acted. Often during the movie I thought that the character changes were radical and too quick but looking back they seem just right, normally in a movie when a character changes you think, what a bad script. But in this movie it seemed to me that Grace (and Kidman) seemed to change back and forth with ease. The abuse of Grace is very emotional and very frightening (it makes you want to question yourself). The first rape scene and how she 'takes'(sorry) all the other rapes and abuse just makes you so angry at her and to sympathetic to her.Edison on the other hand.... I hated him with a fiery passion from the start and especially nearing the end, how can he say that he loved Grace when he let all the men of the town (including his father) rape her on a daily basis, how could he let the abuse happen at all. He is ineffectual and annoying but he has to be for the film and plot to work right.The message of the film is about good and bad people most agree and depending on who you are what you get from it differs but what I thought was that people are at nature bad and as much as they cover it up, given the chance they will exploit and abuse when they no there will be no blame.Overall: 10/10 - the set is AMAZING and worth the 3 hours just for that.",Dogville
479,NovocaineOfArabia,what a senseless waste of time,1,14 May 2005,"I found it so amazingly awful I don't know where to start. It's a very bad movie, meaningless, quite ridiculous now and then, empty, but what irritates me so is that it is disguised as an ""intellectual"" European movie. Von Trier obviously thinks good European movies have/are expected to be static (incredibly long and boring *150min.), essential, betting all on dialogs. if only dialogs made sense! He wants to make us believe he's actually saying something but he's NOT. It's the worst screenplay I've ever seen. He shouldn't write his own movies, actually he shouldn't direct them neither. What are Lauren Bacall, John Hurt, Nicole Kidman, James Caan doing there??? I don't understand how he manged to fool so many people (and many critics, especially at Cannes) pretending to make art. This is a masquerade, a pure imitation of good cinema (and not even a good one I can tell you), a empty box. Don't waste time on this ...., watch a good, healthy, poetic Ingmar Bergman movie. Or Bresson. That is art.",Dogville

481,lukaso,The journey isn't worth the destination,5,4 October 2004,"While watching the second half of Dogville, I glanced at my watch at 5 minutes intervals, or so it felt. The story dragged on, and having reached its conclusion, left me displeased. The subject matter is heavy-handed, using the proverbial hammer to push in a thumbtack. On the positive side, the film has bold artistic style, striking cinematography, and a cadre of well known actors that makes the most of the script. If your tastes go toward independent movies with weighty themes and meaningful pauses, this is your movie. If, on the other hand, you seek an escape from your regular life, and a plot that quickly moves you through, try something else.",Dogville

483,mowglibaghira,A Path-breaking classic,9,9 September 2012,"As the movie starts and the peculiar set without any prop or scenery or construction is projected, one tends to get uneasy. Such stuffs are only seen in classic dramas nowadays. However it also tends to promise a great act ahead.and a great act it turns out to be.Movie progresses with a slow pace, with the director giving sufficient time to the characters and events,managing a firm hold on the plot which itself is the USP of this very different movie.Acting is commendable and transition through chapters smooth with the idea in the mind of filmmaker clearly conveyed.If any one of these elements had gone wrong it may have been another mediocre experiment, however I am glad it turned out to be very interesting. I would count it as a path-breaking classic and a must watch for movie buffs.Have patience, you wont be disappointed. Enjoy!!",Dogville

This is a film I wouldn't even wish for my greatest enemy to suffer watching.To make matters worse, the film is divided into 9 chapters- each one mentioned just to remind you how much more you have to suffer if you are to watch the rest of the film. If I had wanted to see a play, I would have gone to the theatre!!I cannot express enough how appallingly boring this film was, during the hour I was unfortunate enough to be in the cinema, a constant flow of people left the film at different intervals.

How can you delve into the social significance of a film when you're fighting off the urge to fall to sleep? They paid the entire budget to getting Nicole Kidman to star in it and obviously couldn't afford to pay for a proper set.  I cannot discourage you enough from seeing this banal detritus.  I get a student discount so it only cost me £3.70 to get in, I still feel ripped off.  My friend received too much change from the cashier in the cinema so he was effectively paid to go and watch this and he still feels it was a waste of time.  The makers of this film have their heads so far up their own backsides it's unbelieveable. Avoid at all costs unless you've got your head up your own backside as well!!!",Dogville
486,flipjoint,An amazing bare-bones character study.,10,16 March 2004,"Dogville is an astonishing piece of work.  Essentially a stage play with no sets and very few props, the film demonstrates that with a good story, interesting characters, and great performances you don't need anything else to be wholly satisfying.  I found myself reflecting on the film a lot after viewing it.  Specifically comparing the actions and attitudes of the characters in the film to the reactions of the audience with whom I view it. I couldn't help but be disturbed by the bloodthirsty audience relishing in the revenge tale set before us.  While it's not a film I could watch over and over again, I still plan on adding it to my DVD collection the second it becomes available.  I think it's that extra-ordinary.",Dogville
487,aardewerk,This is your darkside too !,10,16 March 2004,"Lars von Trier shows us the dark side of humanity, it's not just about Americans, it's about people in general. Just like the people in Breaking the waves and Dancer in the dark, main characters in Dogville are normal people as you can find them everywhere, but under curtain circumstances they change, the nice neighbour becomes a murderer, a thief or a rapist. You and I might react the same way, in the same situation. And to be honest, wouldn't you take your change, when you are the master in a master/slave - relationship, wouldn't you abuse a beautiful woman if you're almost curtain that no one will ever punish you for your crime. Then there is a young woman, almost a saint, she forgives, she carries her cross without hesitating, until the moment when she breaks. The good Grace dies, and she is reborn a disappointed woman (she lost her belief in all that's good, in humanity in general), full of hate and wishing for revenge. No mercy for the people of Dogville, only for Mozes - the dog , cause he is the only innocent being in Dogville. The world sure is better place without Dogville. The world would surely a better place without humanity.",Dogville
488,paradox2,are you ready for this?,10,29 March 2004,"I guess the beauty of being free-thinking creatures in the universe is that we are allowed to interpret anything we saw in our own way. Film is a very private journey for me, it reflects and reveals your inner self like no other medium. We walked out of the theater with our own impression of what the movie is all about. We live in the world we created which is composed of nothing more than our perception of reality. What kind of world you rather live in? One with hatred, doubt, anger or one with acceptance and love? (This is not a rhetorical question when you come to think about it.)I love Dogville. This film is daring and challenging to watch. Not because its length, but its rawness that breaks the traditional perception of movies and therefore cross the safety line that protected us audience from reality complication. Maybe that is why Lars made film in this format, after stripping off all the distraction and glamour of movies, what is left is just bare human emotion and a question - how you are going to deal with this?In this film, there are many close-up with no dialog, you are forced to watched the emotional transition without the assistance of words, again I think is another reason this movie is powerful, while Lars explored his actors emotion, he did it to us as well.The acting is unbelievable, what a difficult piece to perform. The set is so simple, camera is right in front of you, there is simply no place to hide. Nicole Kidman has grown into an outstanding actor. This is one of her most challenging roles, both technically and emotionally, and she handled it with grace and honesty. Lars had an interesting idea and a very creative way of presenting it, but it¡¯s the acting in this film that delivered the explosion to our hearts.The ending, hmmm¡­ the ending is very interesting. (if you haven't seen the movie, stop reading here) Lars being Lars, had to throw this curve ball at the end, just when you think you got it. When Grace watching ,in tears, the massacre she ordered, you wonder if she is killing her dreams or she is ever determined to up-hold the dreams ¡­  I guess Lars is not done telling his story yet¡­",Dogville

Highly controversial and therefore worth seeing-a bit like ""Leaving Las Vegas"" in that way. Outstanding acting, meaning that it was well directed, with an interesting storyline. One of Nicole Kidman's best performances. That the movie was completely overlooked at Oscar time was no surprise, due, no doubt, to its supposed controversial anti-American topic. Frankly, this movie has no such bias and I wonder who decided that it did, spreading that opinion-perhaps maliciously. Considering the tripe that usually wins in the best picture category, it is really no surprise that such original films are ignored.",Dogville

You leave feeling you have watched a very detailed story when, in fact, it is more nearly a stage play.  It is almost too dangerous to say too much as it will spoil the event for others, but I would highly recommend this movie to any serious moviegoer.  The basic assumption that we all have some ""inner goodness"" takes a serious blow, and creates some real soul-searching in the process.  In trying to do good for someone, I think we often do them an injustice, which is just what the director has shown here.  Where do I sign up for the Nicole Kidman fan club?  This is one of the few movies I have seen lately that I really feel I got my money's worth!",Dogville

Kidman has an excellent acting way and after Cruise's divorce  Isuppose she has made a great step in her career. In the relevant film site in Greece,Dogville is the first film of all.I believe it's very unfair of such movie to be ostracised in a 102 position,although in the same time worse films possess high positions,even in the first decade.

It doesn't take three hours to tell me how bad human beings can be to each other. I know that from first hand experience. If it wasn't for the kindness of strangers I would have put a bullet in my head years ago. Second, this is just a poorly put together group of unfocused, badly edited clips. It took way to long for each scene to be completed. The actors delivered ""robotic"" performances. Toward the end that narrator just kept going on and on.

The direction and writing was pretensious and childish. How did this director assemble such a talented cast with such bull***t posing as a script.2/3rds of the audience walked out or fell asleep.I was nice to see Nichole Kidman play herself.The film could have been cut in half and provided the audience with a story that was held their attention.Please stop this director before he writes and directs again!,Dogville
495,kub2001,How many times can a person be raped in a film?,1,11 May 2004,"According to Lars Von Trier you cant have too many.I think Von Trier is very talented with artistic ideas,but he messes them up with constant catastrophic events to his leading ladies.These ""victims"" atrocities get worse and worse as the film goes on,and half the time all they have to do is speak up.For example,Nicole Kidman shows up and they put her to work,the work gets harder and harder. The town starts to be rude to her,and some strange psycho kid wants to be spanked by her.Next every man in town rapes her,even the old blind man.And to cap it off they chain her to a tire with a bell and break all of her belongings.All she had to do was speak out or go back down the hill,because the problems with her father were nothing compared to being raped multible times and physically abused.Its just stupid,he should have called it ""Jewish Women Goes to Naziville"" Watch Dancer In The Dark same movie except with Bjork.",Dogville
496,ronin7,A new technical production for a new morality?,10,13 June 2004,"The staging with marked lines and a few significant props focused the whole attention on the script and its interpretation. The plot moved with the perfection and inevitability of a classic Greek tragedy to its conclusion. After the shock of the massacre at the end, with the clearing of the fog of violence, the necessity of the destruction of the town became evident. The father's use of the word ""arrogance"" to his daughter in her apparent forgiveness of faults in others that she would not tolerate in herself cut through the hypocrisy that decades of ""political correctness"" have used to blur morality in our society. The 'dogme' ideal of filming from beginning to end, of no special effects blended beautifully with the sound track, use of voice-over and mounted cameras to give a new standard to film. Since seeing Dogville I have found everything else contrived, artificial and forced. I feel I am doomed to watch Dogville over and over for the rest of my life, faintly hoping that there are other film-makers who have been inspired by Lars Von Trier. And how much of the film's brilliance came from one mind being writer director and cameraman, I wonder?",Dogville

499,ekkelund,"Dogville, the most stirring movie I have ever seen",10,11 July 2004,"I once saw Trier being interviewed by one of the most lovable and humoristic journalists in Denmark. Trier, however, appeared very hostile and unsympathetic, but at the same time brutally honest. He seems to be a person who don't try to please you, and he always has this kind of devilish smile on his face, which indicates, that you're in for some more teasing and provocation.To me Dogville reflects Triers opinion on human nature. There is no difference to the human being whether you're living in America or any other country in the world. Under the same circumstances people react in the same way, and history repeats itself. It's a shame, that so many people, only see this movie as a plot against the USA. However, I do acknowledge the fact, that a genius film director from a country that is so overwhelmed by the American culture and who has no power in worldwide politics, sees a chance to knock off America from it's pedestal. And in my opinion he is entitled to, because at the same time he has made a movie that disturbed and questioned my view on myself as a member of the human race. I was both horrified and amazed to discover that even though you feel for the character Grace, you know, that had you lived among those people, you would have been just as cruel and evil to this vulnerable person.It's not that I haven't thought about this before, but Trier truly made me realize, so deep that I felt it in my gut for days: We all have it in us. Perhaps Trier want to make us aware of the fact that we all hold evil as well as goodness, and maybe this will be the first step to control it......",Dogville

501,jon-519,Cynical yet very sincere story.,10,28 August 2004,"First of all, this is an analysis I wrote right after watching the movie, so it might sound a bit raw, since I felt hysterical and numb because Mr. Von Trier really knows how to push my buttons. After ""Dancer In The Dark"" I vowed to myself that I will never be the same again. I also vowed that to myself after ""Dogville"" and ""Breaking The Waves"". Go figure. Anyway, maybe the following has been brought up before, but this is my perspective.totally felt some Bible allegory going through the movie. Grace (thus the name) resembles Christ, tempted and thrown out of Paradise for arrogance. From now on I'll simply refer to Christ as Her, to solve misunderstanding between sexes. Grace ended up in Dogville, a quiet little town which describes the Earth best. It features every single aspect of humankind with its flaws and virtues through each and every person. Grace came as a gift from up above, she ""gave"" the blinded man his eyes, talked to people in need of communication and helped folks with their chores. As time moved on, people discovered that Grace's obligingness is easily abused, so they took advantage of her and how much didn't they make her work or used her, Grace never got upset. She even repeated, that nobody's doing anything wrong, even after she got her ""cross to bear"" - the chain around her neck.It appeared that James Caan's character a.k.a Lord had put Grace in Dogville for certain reasons, for her to understand the malignity of humankind. Notice the way Grace talks to him, simply referring to him as ""father"", not using his real name, which God doesn't have as we know. Also notice the submissive tone in her voice. When her father explains her the reasons she got thrown out, he demands not to open the curtains of the vehicle. This could be translated as ""one cannot see the face of God"". The point is, the curtains could be opened only after the townspeople were killed one by one and the city was in flames. A little bit of Judgment Day there. God was intimidated by the malice of people and sent his son on earth to explore the ""real"" life. Son in the form of Grace continuously tried to understand what people did to her, but at one point she also realized that world has turned into a place, where morality remains nothing but a word. She decided to destroy everything. In the end, notice that the only survivor is Moses. Open the Holy Book and draw your own conclusions.10/10P.S.

So there is a great amount of attention placed on the actors and it is mostly up to them to bring a sense of place to the movie. The cast is Phenomenal and do an excellent job creating the characters and the sense of place and time. There is message about kindness and one's sense of boundaries; where is the line drawn on ""turning the other cheek"" when others inflict harm on a person? This movie is as emotionally painful as ""Breaking the Waves"" and as poignant. May it touch you.",Dogville
505,dmcintosh-1,Brilliant,10,15 November 2004,"Only a handful of movies are capable of evoking any sort of response without the use of elaborate sets and special effects. Dogville, although it almost lost my (MTV/ADD) interest in the very beginning due to the lack of anything, focuses less on aesthetic externalities and keys in on using the true batter that any good movie is made from and that is equal parts great story, superb acting, and an ending that summons the audience to take a moment and absorb. I certainly absorbed as much as I could the first time through and like other classics will be able to pick up nuances each time here after. I can go on, but why? You know you should see it and if you have seen it you know what all the gibberish is about.",Dogville
506,badhairwemberly-1,That was the worst movie I have ever seen. ever.,1,17 December 2004,"My one word review:Dogs**tTo elaborate:You know that ""state of suspended belief"" that Grace was in when things started going South in Dogville? That's how I feel after having watched it. No, it's worse than that. I feel like she must have after the trucker raped her in the back of the Model A. What a pretentious, empty, monotonous, poorly lit, ugly, overlong waste of time. I have never hated a movie so much, so much so that I had to join this forum just to vent. I want to find the guy who directed it and kick his ass. It can't be that bad, can it? OK, let's review:1) The ""stage"". Cute device, for about 5 minutes. Does it advance the story? No. Does it make the movie's 2+ hours any less painful? No. It is distracting. It is repetitive. It is depressing. 2) No character has a single redeeming quality. Every character is so flat, so obviously allegorical, that I could never ascribe human emotion or motivation to any of them. It wasn't the actors' fault, they just had nothing to work with. They look as bored and as uninspired as a dentist's waiting room. 3) Better motifs in a Jerry Bruckheimer film. Only the cars were real. Oooh, what a scathing comment on American society. The thorns and the flowers on the imaginary bush. The shifting light on the characters and the town. All of the dog allegories; Grace's collar, the name of the town, the discussion of human behavior at the end of the movie, the dog surviving at the end. The figurines. And playing ""Young Americans"" at the end with the pictures of the underside of American society? Sorry man, I wasn't paying attention for the last 2 hours because you bored me to sleep. What were you trying to say again? 4) Tom is a bad writer and an insufferable moralist that bores his audience at the meetings? Unfortunately, that was the only metaphor that worked in the entire movie. If you are going to depress the hell out of the kids in the movie house, it doesn't hurt to have something original, interesting, or even coherent to say. Here are a few good movies about the dark side of human nature that aren't exactly brass bands either:Das Boot, Dog Day Afternoon, Carnal Knowledge, Blood Simple, Cool Hand Luke (better use of Christ imagery by the way) Miller's Crossing, Blue Velvet, The Last Picture Show, Crimes and Misdemeanors,It's not that depressing movies are bad. The problem is that bad movies are depressing.",Dogville
507,HippieKid31,A brilliant film! Not to be missed!!,10,26 March 2005,"I cannot even describe how brilliant this film is. I was so moved and disturbed by the film. It is a gripping portrayal of how humans take advantage of one another, and how greed and selfishness can affect people. The acting in the film was absolutely BRILLIANT. Nicole Kidman's beautiful and nuanced performance is NOT TO BE MISSED.It is the best one of her career (followed closely by THE HOURS and TO DIE FOR). Kudos also go to Paul Bettany, Ben Gazzara, Stellan Sarsgard and Chloe Sevigny for absolutely pitch perfect performances. The concept of the film was also brilliant. The use of minimal set and putting the whole thing in the chalk outline of a small town gave it such an alienating quality that was absolutely gripping. It is a cinematic Our Town, only darker (if possible).Something must also be said for Patricia Clarkson's performance. I cannot believe I forgot about her earlier. WOAH!!! Amazing. The Best Thing I've ever seen her do.I cannot tell you how wonderful and brilliant this movie is. It's three hour running time was the best Three hours of my week. I cannot believe that this film was not recognized by more of the mainstream awards in the US. Especially the Best Acting Ensemble award at the SAG's. The ensemble of this movie was STELLAR. Absolutely AMAZING!!! I cannot say enough about this film. IT IS NOT TO BE MISSED!!!! ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!!!!",Dogville
508,jessiedu03,a terrible movie,1,3 January 2005,This movie is total crap- hands down the worst movie I've ever seen. Terribly boring and the plot is nonsensical. Don't waste the rental fee; Gigli would be a better choice than this stinker. I have absolutely nothing else to say about this terrible movie but for some inexplicable reason I can't submit my comment unless I have 10 lines of text. Maybe this was von Trier's problem- he thought he had to pad the movie with hours of useless and painfully boring dialogue culminating in a stupid ending that made absolutely no sense whatsoever in order to reach some sort of three hour minimum length. What a waste of a movie and of the talent of some usually decent actors.,Dogville
509,can-atakan-ugur123,Best movie ever!,10,15 July 2015,"Dogville is a disturbing movie. After I watched it, I couldn't sleep for 3 days. It makes you to think about mercy, crime and punishment. Dialogues were really good. Every minute of this movie was great. Dogville's directing was godlike, too. Camera angels were best. Trier filmed Dogville like a theater. Dogville's scenes were natural. Lars Von Trier's best movie for me. Nicole Kidman's act was really charming, too. All of actors were very good but as I said, Kidman got over herself. Dogville is just like Bible. It tells about everything we,humanity,need. Arrogance, mercy, punishment, love, crime, kill, death. When you watch it,you feel everything.",Dogville
510,Mary_X,It's clear to see why the American critics denied this film the credit it deserves.,9,14 January 2005,"Dogme initiator Von Trier has produced a film that manages to contrast visual flamboyancy with visual bleakness in combining impressive costume design and props without any 'actual' set. Grace (Kidman) embarks on small suburban town Dogville and although seemingly normal to the town's residents, the viewer is watching these people subsist in houses not too dissimilarly at all, to that of a Cluedo board in that their foundations are chalked out like corpses at crime scenes yet lacking the customary four walls. It looks theatrical, like a Peter Greenaway production with (dare I say) lower standards and on a tight budget. Though initially hard for the eyes to get used to, after watching the film for its three hour duration you'll think all towns look like this. As for the plot itself, it's pretty classic. This town is close, dependent solely on itself and strongly set in its self proclaimed flawless, traditional American standards. Naturally Grace is from somewhere else, somewhere that isn't Dogville and her job as an outsider is to integrate herself into this town; this family. Her 'helper' in all this is resident Tom (Bettany) who tries his damnedest to have his people accept her as one of them. To go any further would be truly spoiling as from here the script gets intrinsically clever making the viewer feel endearance in areas and ultimately discomfort and upset in others. At the heart of this film is the effect that instinctively follows a cause in social interaction. This is an illustration of the downfall of an American dream.",Dogville

Prestigeous director and good cast, but horrible picture. In Kidman's words... ""this was a strange experience""... infinitely much more for the sacrificated audience that they can't stand it and its 142 minutes (aprox.)... a waste of time... It's difficult to say something positive about the movie. I think the performances are really up but they are a little bit confused by the poor set. And the last scene with crude images of murders committed by the gangsters are unnecessary. And what about the dog? It doesn't exist more than in a ridiculous picture on the floor.",Dogville
513,vpd9563,#1 WORST movie of all time,1,11 February 2005,"Look, everyone is entitled to their own opinion of whether or not this is a good movie......but anyone who doesn't realize that LARS VON TRIER is an anti-American, American bashing jerk is simply uninformed. Of course, some of you defend him because you are also anti-American. But since you seem so uninformed let me inform you....these are direct quotes from the jerk himself. #1, for those who think the movie wasn't targeted at America, jerkboy says this about the movie ""Two things inspired me to write ""Dogville"". First of all, I went to Cannes with ""Dancer in the Dark"" and I was criticized by some American journalists for making a film about the USA without ever having been there. This provoked me because, as far as I can recall, they never went to Casablanca when they made ""Casablanca"". I thought that was unfair so I decided then and there that I would make more films that take place in America. "" #2 ""Dogville"" takes place in America but it's only America as seen from my point of view"" Now, I ask you, how informed is his point of view when he has never even BEEN here? Anyone who would even have this type of point of view while having no first hand knowledge is simply a bigot, and it's as simple as that. #3 , the jerk continues with his America bashing... ""In addition to the countless American programmes on Danish television, there is also a lot of news because America is the biggest power in the world. There's a lot of criticism, too. In my youth, we had some big demonstrations against the World Bank and the Vietnam War and we all turned out to throw rocks at embassies. Well, at one embassy But I don't throw rocks anymore. Now I just tease. I learned when I was very small that if you are strong, you also have to be just and good, and that's not something you see in America at all"" Get it??? He threw rocks at ONE embassy. And, of course using his workds, being just and good is not something he sees in America. And finally, "" What can I say about America? Power corrupts. And that's a fact. Then again,since they are so powerful, it's okay to tease because I can't harm America, right? So there you have Lars, in all of his small minded glory. So those of you who care if this jerk is a bigot or not, there you have it.....And those of you who don't care, well you are entitled to your own opinions....",Dogville
514,drjamesr,a film makes that you think,9,19 February 2005,"A film that leaves one wondering the next day about the thoughts and questions it raises. The obvious dominant theme is that power corrupts and the more power the greater the corruption. But as the cast make a thing of it, is 'arrogance' a stronger theme and if so just exactly in what way? And who is the most despicable character - might it in the end be the heroine. Is escape from our background in life ever possible and can we ever find freedom? Is the violation of trust worse than the violation of the female body? Would we, as allegedly civilised compassionate people in the audience in fact be there doing the same in the same circumstances? Is there a religious parallel as Grace endures the agonies the town folk dispense - but if so Grace's 'resurrection' seated literally at the right hand of the Father at the of the film is hardly heaven on earth. Do we see what went on objectively or do we see what the narrator of the film interprets and thinks we should see? All these questions will make sense once the film has been watched. I have no idea what the answers are and that's a big part of the attraction of this film.",Dogville
515,CR010997,Something Rotten......???,4,2 March 2005,"It just gets more complicated the more I think about it. And, I have thought about it almost constantly!! I agree the film is mostly about power and corruption and corruptibility. BUT, I do not agree with the idea that had we been in any of these characters' places we would have behaved in the same way. Not one of them had a redeeming feature... conscience..compassionshame! And that includes Grace, who, despite her meek almost saintly exterior, turns out to be the most corruptible of them all.The townspeople of Dogville misuse power as only those who are already corrupt can. They were already in need of moral correction in one way or another, as the narrator tells us in the prologue. Almost every one of them is hiding some moral flaw, or practising some deception, whether it be on their neighbours or on the outside world. In fact, as Chuck says, the town is ""rotten from the inside out"" when Grace sees it as a pretty place.Later, she finds he has been right and that this idyllic exterior hides a totally evil reality. Not one inhabitant shows pity for her in her predicament, but instead, each of them in one way or another uses her situation to demonstrate their increasing power over her, until ultimately she is reduced to a thing, to be used indiscriminately, according to the individual's whim. All the basest features of humanity emerge: greed and lust in the nightly rapes by the male population, and bullying and petty vengeance from the females. And there is no exception. Not one person displays even a hint of shame or remorse at their behaviour.I am offended at the idea that given the opportunity all males would behave as they did in Dogville. I am offended at the portrayal of women as being victims of society, and shallow, petty and vengeful towards one of their sisters. Most of all, I am offended that Lars Von Trier expects us to accept his bleak and warped view of human nature, which to him is completely and irredeemably immoral. If there is any mistaking this, the end of the film will ensure we are in no doubt of his message. Even the long-suffering and angelic Grace, when given the promise of power, swiftly forgets any thought of forgiveness and exacts the most terrible and vicious vengeance for all acts against her.Thus, Von Trier is saying to us that under a thin veneer of civilisation, mankind is essentially corrupt, and power in our hands will reveal this. Yes! In some peoples' hands! If Dogville is to be seen as a microcosm of humanity, then every one of us, without exception, is susceptible to the corruption that power over our fellow man brings. According to LVT there is not a good apple in the crate! (I believe apples and crates were symbolic of this among other concepts)Sorry, Mr Von Trier, here's one apple that believes there are certainly many bruised apples and several rotten ones in our crate, but who won't take your desperately pessimistic view of wholesale rottenness seriously. What was that quote from Hamlet??",Dogville
516,o-tikhomirov,"Very interesting movie, especially for those loving theater",8,2 June 2014,"I have tried not to spoiler anything, but I think I pretty much gave away the mood of the film. As I am an acting student, for me this movie was especially interesting to see: the mix of camera acting and acting on a stage must be very challenging for the actors, yet they manage to give a very good performance. The story itself is quite depressing, it shows how even the most regular people can turn to evil actions when they are put in a position of power. The evolution of the village Dogville and its inhabitants goes ahead in an achingly slow pace. The more so the movie is an uneasy experience and you are constantly hoping the events will make a turn for the better, as you are struggling and suffering with the main character. I liked that picture very much and I can recommend it to everyone. That said, I think that everyone who is in any way interested in film should give it a try, as the concept of filming it differs so much from the common movies we see.",Dogville
517,mwmfornow,Lars Von Trier Should Seek Medical Attention Immediately,1,3 April 2005,"Seriously, I'm worried about that dude. Something must have happened to him. Maybe he burst a blood vessel in his brain. Maybe he has developed a hormonal imbalance. But after proving his abilities with the remarkable and heart-rending ""Dancer in the Dark"", it's hard to take ""Dogville"" as anything less than a cry for help. This movie is flat out awful. The plot could kindly be called ""allegorical"" by people who don't want to say ""implausible"" or, more honestly, ""shitty"". The characters might be called one-dimensional, if they even had reliable, static traits, which they don't. The story is a sensationalistic, over-the-top account of rape, slavery and murder, and yet it manages to be crushingly, ploddingly, maddeningly SLOW (nearly 3 hours). The cameras were in focus, and Nicole Kidman was attractive, but other than that it is hard to think of a single thing that went right. Now, I understand that a lot of people love this movie because they think it exposes the seedy underbelly of human nature in general, and of the American national character in specific. (I certainly won't question Von Trier's credentials as a commentator on American culture, having lived all his life in Copenhagen, a city with several American fast food restaurants.) And I imagine you really could make a great movie about a woman who is initially welcomed and eventually enslaved and violated by a small American town. However, this ain't that movie. In order to understand the depths of awfulness that this film achieves, maybe it would be helpful to enumerate some of the things that would be different in this highly theoretical 'good' version of 'Dogville' relative to the all-too-actual 'Mongolian clusterfuck' version I review here.1) It would have very little voice-over. Voiceovers are to movies what bandages are to people: both indicate that that something has gone wrong. Voiceovers usually mean that a director made a major change to the movie after principle photography, generally because he (Von Trier being a he) has realized in editing that the movie he shot sucks dick. Our theoretical 'good' Dogville would have no need of repeated voice-over, because the story would actually tell itself.2) Grace (Kidman) would be a rational human being. She would do things that would help her avoid suffering, like resisting at least one of her many rapists, or telling someone that Tom had stolen the $10, or pressuring Tom to get her out of town early on, or saving up her money for a damn bicycle instead of those cheap figurines, or trying to make friends with someone in the town in order to solidify her precarious position. Something like that. She definitely wouldn't spend the first 2.5 hours suffering silently like some martyred saint, and then last 20 minutes burning the place down like Attila the Hun. 3) Tom would be a rational human being. He would be bookish, but not completely insane. He would fall in love with Grace, and then show some actual concern for her safety, instead of wandering around for two hours spouting nonsense. And most importantly, when he found out about the rape it would have some kind of emotional effect on him (any normal person would FLIP OUT). He certainly wouldn't go to this woman that he apparently loves and gently bitch to her about how unfair it is that he is the only person who doesn't get to rape her. And even if he DID do that, Grace would respond with something a little more salty than a lecture from a graduate level philosophy seminar on the nature of love in a slave society. 4) The other townspeople would be rational human beings. There would be less of them, say 9 instead of 15, which would allow each one to appear on screen more than once every 30 minutes. There would be a good reason why, say, the church organist who befriends Grace doesn't protest when Grace is literally placed in shackles, a reason better than, ""Boy it would be inconvenient if I had to start sweeping the stairs again."" Even if there was a reason, some of the townsfolk would at least be SOMEWHAT conflicted about the whole idea. Oh, and there would be a good reason why the first person to take a disliking to Grace wouldn't immediately drop a dime in order to get the $5000 reward.5) The movie would be about 75 minutes shorter. The extra time would come from all the time the characters spend milling about, doing chores, talking about nothing. Grace would show up in the first five minutes, she would be raped within the first 60 minutes, and the town would be burning by the 100 minute mark. Tom wouldn't get more than a minute to yammer on about moral rearmament, nor would anyone get to spend 10 minutes shouting the word ""arrogant"" repeatedly. These are just some of the things that would happen in a good version of ""Dogville"". Two thing you wouldn't need to change is the excellent ensemble cast and a director who, when properly medicated, is quite talented. But then, as flawed as ""Dogville"" is, this amounts to no more than installing expensive toilets on the Titanic. IN CONCLUSION: Do not see Dogville. It isn't worth your time, even in a so-bad-it's-good sort of way. If you like America-bashing, rent a Michael Moore film. Moore is at least funny and concise. ""Dogville"" is a muddled, frustrating, ridiculous mess. None of the characters ring true, and as a result, the horror and shock that should accompany this story never materialize. If you just have to know what you are missing, go see ""Dancer in the Dark"" and try to imagine a horribly botched sequel. But again, do not see ""Dogville"" under any circumstances.",Dogville
518,sonoranproduct,Wonderful Film,10,9 April 2005,"After watching this film for about five minutes, I was a bit disturbed by the fact that I felt like I was watching a cheap play, turned video. I'm glad I stuck with it. I don't think that it received all the festival acclaim just because of Lars but because it was one of the most original, brilliantly constructed and acted film that I've seen in years. Nicole Kidman was, as usual, at the top of her game. This is a piece of fiction and as much as anyone in the US would hate to admit, could or has happened. It captures the essence of American greed and self absorbance. Although a bit too long at around 3 hours, it's never dull and with each chapter, it leaves the viewer wanting more. This is one I would recommend to anyone and will make sure to add to my collection.",Dogville

She was absolutely brilliant. Everybody knows the synopsis, so I would rather not dwell too much on that. The movie was at first very disconcerting when it comes to the set, and it took me quite a while to get adjusted to that. But as the movie goes on, as grace is subjected to more and more humiliation, it just makes you cringe and want to get away from it. But then, I could never leave a movie in between, ( I actually sat through all of little nicky, yet another teen movie etc)and surely not this one. By the end you get to hate the people of dogville so much, and the climax is the only possible thing that could have made a person survive this.

There's not even any real doors or walls, it seemed like nothing but a cheap movie someone had thrown together quickly. Yet, from the moment I pressed play; I was stuck!It's such an odd, beautiful movie, almost haunting in a way. The shocking truth about the people of dogville wasn't what I was expecting, and the situation Grace is in left me frustrated and angry at the villagers. Until, the ending. The ending was one of those final scenes that you have been waiting to see for the last, half of the movie. The satisfaction of the final scene was worth all of the frustration through the 'struggles' Grace has to suffer through.It's a very different, but great movie.

My mind just kind of filled in the blanks and I barely even noticed their absence. The acting is absolutely brilliant, Nicole Kidman in particular. I thought that the running time was a bit long, but that the ending was absolutely superb.

522,rayjiangsjunk,The dogs of Dogville (Reflecting on Dogville),10,26 June 2005,"I can't remember the last time I watched a film as provocative as Dogville. It had a good premise, out standing acting and an extremely satisfying twist. A cross between theater and reading a novel, Dogville traces the tragic experiences of the fugitive, Grace and the events that take place when the town of Dogville takes her in. Moments of the film were devastating, not surprising from Lars von Trier but unlike Dancer in the Dark, the film was not only shocking but oddly satisfying. I couldn't help but smile as I watched revenge at its best. However, more profounding were the messages the film sought to raise. First of all, Dogville completely blew the phrase ""oh its only human"" out of the water. Being human is not an excuse for behavioural flaws, injustice and negligence. In fact, by being human, one should have the will and conscience to mend their personal flaws as opposed to just sit on them. Further more, the film raises the idea that we are utterly, obliviously immersed in our own ego. Grace felt that her own ethical standards were higher than that of others and in her arrogance, she was willing to forgive people for actions she would not forgive herself. The inhabitants of Dogville represented every thing that wasn't human which resulted in bloodshed as Grace came to terms with her arrogance. She swallowed her petty pride and unleashed revenge as opposed to the unconditional and undeserving forgiveness we are all so accustomed to. Grace realized that ""being human"" was no justification for the inhumanity and degradation of Dogville. The truth was, the people of Dogville deserved very bit of punishment Grace was willing to inflict. It is not human to succumb to temptation, it is not human to have no self control and it is not human to betray trust. The so called humble town which represented every thing our twisted morals saw as human and good turned out be the greatest tragedy of them all. And the bitter irony echoes through the final scene with a bark from the last inhabitant of Dogville. The only person who remained true as a human, the dog of Dogville. We would force a dog to be human so that we our selves can be dogs.",Dogville

Oh it's just the DVD player trying to kill itself!,1,19 November 2006,"When this movie was over I thought to myself ""The clock says three hours has passed, but in my mind it feels like it has been 3 years."" Dogville was a horrible movie and there is no question about it, nothing will EVER make me want to see this movie again or think about changing my mind. Here is the plot, Nicole Kidman enters this town of Dogville or as I like to call it: A stage with chalk all over it, that has sound effects for doors and dogs. Anyway, Nicole Kidman (who cares about her name in the movie) enters the town of Dogville for protection and as a hiding place all with the help of her new friend Paul Bettany (once again who cares what his name is). There is only one problem, everyone in the town except Paul either hates her or doesn't want her there, but they do let her stay if she completes chores for the town. Nicole never reveals her secret to the town, all they know is that she is wanted by the police. Finally, when she begins reading to the blind man of the town, you think she has someone on her side. But if you thought this you would be wrong because eventually he RAPES her. And if that wasn't enough the whole male side of the town has a go with her as well. So now, all the males are raping her through black mail (the classic: I'll give you too the police, if you won't let me rape you!) and all the females are destroying her beloved little figurines (that serve no purpose) because they think if my husband raped you well then it is your fault and you are a hussy! So that goes on for about an hour, until she thinks she is escaping out of the town by one of the townsfolk, but as her luck would have it they were really just turning her over to what she was running from in the first place! But wait it gets even more ridiculous, what she was running from and why the cops wanted to find her is (drumroll)..........................Her DAD IS A GANGSTER AND SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE APART OF IT ANYMORE!!! When you hear this a lot of questions come into your mind like: Why was she letting herself get raped if it was just her dad? Is this the dumbest movie ever made? The answer to your first question is because she is an idiot and the second answer is ""you betcha ya!"" Oh and if you want to know how it ends, Nicole makes her gangster dad (James Caan) light the entire town of Dogville on fire and kill everyone in it. Now I am not kidding when I tell you that Dogville is the worst movie I have ever seen so far in my life. Was it worse than Valley of the Dolls? Oh yeah! Howard the Duck? You can bet your life on it! It was worse than...dare I say it? Yes, I dare. It was worse than Ishtar! To sum everything I just said up: The acting was lackluster and tired; The directing was really simplistic because it was on a stage; The writing was over-the-top and terrible and finally lets not forget the stage and the chalk. The stage with the chalk is like a 3-hour movie where Nicole Kidman lets herself get raped and harassed for no reason.",Dogville
524,iamdafuriousofall,"**Spoiler ahead guys, not much of it but yeah***",9,27 September 2015,"My review for dog ville : Dogville is a movie made by Lars Von trier, hes a Danish filmmaker. This movie is about an American town, the movie revolves completely around Americans, albeit the meaning or the moral of the story could be applied to any country of the world but he (Lars Von trier) used America as an example because in my opinion, America is a country which carries more power with its people. Having the power and freedom, it is easy for people to abuse something so easily, (also it can bring good deeds to society but I'm talking about the DE- merit) So I can guess why he chose America as a setting for his plot. America is indeed a great country, but we also have to see the negative side of this great nation. The movie tells us to understand it and confront ourselves to become more of a human being. Coming to talk about this movie, this movie has a greater meaning to it. About everything, its pure art. Looking every side of the movie, it shines art and implies meaning. When I played this movie, I was looking for something typical European like movie with sex and love, but this movie blew my mind. I showed a slight dislike to the movie because of its appeal of how boring it looks, with a stage like features, and drawn out paths and symbols, I thought they are doing another boring weird art like thing, but that feeling is just for 5 minutes to the intro, after that i felt the movie. It really took me with it. I loved how the narration went and how it brought a meaning to its people and how easily I could compare with people in my real life. The movie. It dwells on people's greed and a need of starvation to exploit something to satisfy themselves, they took Grace, a pale beautiful young girl who escaped gun fires from a gangster, (Nicole kid man) for granted. Used her in all means. The people took complete use of her and exploited her kindness. The movie simply conveys how humans have become like dogs, where they have showed their nature and never got any punishment for their ill behavior. The men squeezed her for their sexual satisfaction, and women abused her for being lewd towards the men. The movie also tells that human kindness is all a shade. It doesn't exist much. People have become disguised so much, that finding the lost kindness is pretty hard. Grace thought she would find, but she didn't, in this town, dog ville. People were first, kind to her, like how they seem but as to the conclusion, they belittle her, using dominance over her kindness, commanding her to work physical labor. She was unable to find the love she received formerly. Just like how humans have turned into now. Grace finally brings justice to the humans as well as to the earth by deleting this town from the face of earth and it also creates a great sense and interpretation on how she avoided killing of the dog as she knew the dog was angry at her because of what she had done at the preface(stealing its bone) and not for anything else, like Which the villagers did with no cause or explanation (not gonna say the entire story here)The movie has used the audience's imagination to the fullest, using a set and transparent homes and building to highlight the characters and showcase them, i appreciate what this movie has granted or contributed much to the cinema arts and how many aspiring filmmakers can learn from this simple yet imaginative technique. The actors and actresses were amazing. Nicole kid man is BEAUTIFUL and AMAZING, it really brought a fury in me after seeing how the villagers extracted every faith in her. And the payback really made it much more awesome (And satisfying). Correct use of violence and correct use of casting I would say.I have to conclude saying that this movie is amazing, slightly slow paced and fabricates tautness, when people are eager to know quick results. This movie is a must watch for every Nicole Kidman movie fan, every artist, every sad disturbing movie lovers. This movie is art. 9/10.",Dogville
525,DaltaV,Fall from Grace: Lars Von Trier and the method of poetry through cheap imagery,7,20 April 2015,"I heard before-hand that I was supposed to either love this film or hate it. I also heard that this was one of the best stories ever put on screen. That this movie is a take on human nature and its immanent cruelty, of its inherited perversion. Boy was I taken for a fool... This was one of the few movies I watched without before having a look at the users reviews on this website, and I'm actually glad I didn't because it would probably have made me even more disappointed by the end of it. Now, I'm not disappointed for the fact that this movie is not good (as my grade shows) but I'm disappointed, and frankly a little upset, at both extremes this movie seems to divide: I'm utterly ashamed for the people who despise it, as well as embarrassed for the ones who find it a MASTERPIECE. This movie possesses great assets. As a matter of fact, I shall say that this movie barely has any flaws, but I think it hardly that either its die-hard fans or virtually blind detractors have any true grasp of what this movie means to achieve. Either viewers hold it in a not so deserving lofty regard or they plain give it no regard at all. And that is, perhaps (to no fault of Von Trier as far as I'm concerned), the ultimate responsible for the movie's fall from Grace (no pun intended).CHAPTER 1: In which the author finds something strikingly odd and is later pleased by itThe first thing to take note whether you like(d) it or not is the scenery. Dogville's scenery consists of what it doesn't consist, which is actually a lot. The movie is entirely set in a studio with black walls and dark floor. The streets and houses delimited by chalk- drawn lines on the pavement. They have no walls, no doors and no other props except for the household items inside them. What this setting proportionates is the sense that you're watching the tape of a recorded play. A sense further increased by the hand- held camera filming, fading lights at the end of scenes and chapter division with the use of epigraphs describing the scene about to take place. Now, as with any sort of recycling of one media into another, this feels weird and misplaced at first but, once delved into it, the feeling takes a turn into fascination. Von Trier helps on that with an admirable good taste in his cinematography, especially the lighting, as he does a great job of using it in benefit of the script and dramatization.CHAPTER 2: In which there was a tap on my imaginary doorThe sound in the movie is limited to sound-effects: doors being knocked, doors being opened, dogs barking, etc. Since there's not much use of it, there's not much use in talking about it.CHAPTER 3: In which merits are given where merits are dueNow let's talk a little about acting. More precisely, I would like to talk about the difference between an uninspired performance and a solid one. Among many misconceptions this movie seems to create, acting is surely one of them. People always seem to get easily driven to either laud or depreciate the actor who receives the most screen time in a movie. That is a mistake in itself, but it is also usually coupled with a bias in direct proportion to the film's quality. You rarely see someone praising an actor for his work in a bad movie. That rareness intensifies itself when said actor is the movie's protagonist (poor Hayden Christensen). That being said, you have probably read on reviews of people who found Dogville to be a masterpiece that Nicole Kidman gave the performance of her career in this movie. It probably didn't stop there and was followed by the case that she displays the best acting overall. That, my friends, is just criminal. While Kidman does give a good performance, she is far from being the best person on screen. Her performance is at best solid, and in that regard alone, her supporting actors did a far greater job. James Caan (whose position as a character I saw coming from a mile away) received very little screen time but presented a vaster variety of nuances in its character in minutes than Kidman did in hours. Considering Grace's experiences and transformation, Kidman could and should have externalized both in a more proper manner. Instead, Grace is left speaking with the same soft whispering voice whether she is the naive woman of the beginning of the story or the one she becomes by the end of it. Her character is numb most ways. Some might interpret this as a trait of the character itself, but to me, it shows as a trait of an uninspired performance. If you watch the scene where Grace is first introduced in the story and then skipped the whole movie all the way to her last appearance, you wouldn't wonder what happened for her to act in such a way, you would simply think that she was like this all along. On the other hand, Paul Bettany, Zeljko Ivanek and Stellan Skarsgård not only give solid performances, but like Caan, deliver on the nuances aspect as well. Bettany essentially carries the movie forward whilst in the shadow of Kidman while Zeljko Ivanek and Stellan Skarsgård give portrayals that show a terrifyingly deep character study.

526,allenstanfield,Von Trier's Allegory,8,1 June 2005,"Anyone who watches this movie and thinks that it's about a naive and vulnerable woman who gets horribly exploited by petty, evil small-town hayseeds is not seeing the movie that was made for you to see.The deliciously wonderful truth about this movie is that there is another movie underneath it.And all you have to do is look to figure it out.When I first started watching Dogville, I began to wonder what the hell was going on. There was a stage with chalk lines for houses - no walls, no doors, and one window (which revealed a character's blindness).There was a dog named Moses whose bark you could hear, but was invisible until the end.There was the character of Grace, who worked magic in people's lives selflessly and without judgement, until the end.And there was a vain blind man.There was also so much more.Lauren Bacall... Ben Gazara.... and many other brilliant actors.It wasn't until the end that I began to realize what I had been watching, and that the rich symbolism that was placed before me had zoomed right over my head.I have since watched it 4 or 5 times to get all of the underlying messages of this wonderful movie.I loved it! The key is the conversation Grace has with the ""Boss"" at the end of the movie.I'm not a Christian, but this movie makes a powerful statement that most non-Christians can understand, and see the Christian Message in a whole new way.Brilliant. Lars Von Trier is one of the most courageous and original movie makers working today.See if you can make out the symbolism yourself.I'll give you the first hint: Nicole Kidman's character is named ""Grace"", and she has a father....",Dogville
527,liselotje__,Comment on a comment.,10,20 October 2005,"I would just like to comment on the comment of the guy from New York City. He is saying that the satire on America is hardly to notice. He's is right about that, but when you know what Lars von Trier stands for: Dogme 95, you know how is making a satire of America. He is doing that through the mise-en-scene, the cinematography, the sound etc etc. Dogme 95 stands for making a film in its purest form. So the film can only be made within a natural environment with natural lights. No props may be used unless they are on location. No artificial sounds and lights may be used. That means no voice-over, no music that has been added. Dogme 95 also stands for not using weapons and not committing murder (in the narrative of the film that is). Also the film must take place where the camera is standing and it has to take place in the here and now. Looking at those rules that have been set up by Lars von Trier and Tomas Vinterbergen and putting those next to the way Dogville has been made, then you see in which way von Trier made a mockery out of America. The entire film takes place in some sort of hall. It is not a natural environment. Also the lights are artificial. There is no mise-en-scene which means there are no real houses and furniture: they are painted on the ground. It is as artificial as it can be. That is also the deal for the sound: there is a voice-over in the film and music has been added. There are also superficial actions taking place. That means murder and weapons. The narrative of the film does not take place in the here and now and sometimes you hear the story taking place without seeing the people that play out the story. So the film doesn't always take place where the camera is standing. Personally I think that von Trier made the film in anti-Dogme way to point out that America's way of making film and therefor way of life is anti his way of life.",Dogville
528,pasternak,"Art or not, this movie is like watching a slow moving play.",1,19 July 2005,"This movie is more like watching a play that has been filmed. To call this a motion picture, or movie, is a misnomer. The camera work is horrible. Like a 90 year old man with Alzheimers trying to hold the lens still after downing four cups of coffee.Ultimately boring and extremely frustrating to watch. Imagine sitting through a 3 hour long play that never changes the set. Staring at a black stage with chalkboard outlines of houses all throughout. This is like the plays you used to put on with your siblings when you were 8 years old. In fact, 8 year olds could probably have made the set more interesting and watchable if not more colorful. The mind-numbing experience of having to 'imagine' doors and walls. This is supposed to be a FILM?! More like a game of CHERADES! I really thought it was a joke in the first 10 minutes or so ... sort of a ""practice run"" if you will, of actors on an empty Hollywood stage.Terrible movie. It should never have made it to DVD. Maybe it would work on the Broadway stage, IF it had any music. Also the voice over was annoying ... that guy's accent is untolerable.",Dogville
529,cyberskate,"Novel, captivating, and compelling",8,23 August 2015,"This is a differently stylized cautionary tale. It is a morality play done in the format of a staged play. Using a minimalist set design, the film allows each actor to showcase their skills. Examining the symbiotic interplay of community personas and their more benevolent. characteristics, they are soon to give way to the darker, secret agendas of each. Motives, so it would seem, have sub-motives.Redemption finally comes in the end, which the viewer finds after nearly three hours in this lengthy film. Perhaps it could have been made much shorter, but the movie never lagged, and was engaging to the finish.The worthwhile message is that progressive liberalism is but a illusion of altruism meant to protect and benefit others, while, in truth, is but a self serving vehicle for protecting oneself...from facing the truth about oneself.",Dogville

A political analysis of the film would have bad results for its lack of objective thoughtfulness, BUT, like a fairytale or a (good) horrorfilm (if that word exists in English :)), Dogville is able to create powerful and very childish (which is positive!) emotions, provided you stop thinking rational and just imaginize the story with full intent. That ability do not many filmmakers have - so it must be an eight - but for the likes of Julius Caesar with Marlon Brando as Mark Antony, it cannot be nine or ten.",Dogville

532,horibraun,It is by far the richest movie I have ever seen.,10,16 August 2005,"It is by far the richest movie I have ever seen. It never stops to puzzle me how many angles you can attach to it. This is a tale about human weakness in face of temptation (mostly of doing evil when you are given the opportunity to), about human society and the morality of its collective judgment, about idealism vs. practicality (see the struggle in Tom Edison's mind), about the birth of America or of any good society as always regenerating from the ashes of a society which was a bit worse (see the ending and the song that runs as backdrop to the credits). It is also a tale of human destiny ruled by chance (see the ending when Grace's change of heart is spurred by a ""sudden change of light"" as the moon emerges to the sky). A tale about arrogance, about the contrast between appearance and essence and I could go on. Besides being rich in meanings - without actually leaving the viewer in a deep ambiguity, which is quite an achievement I believe - this movie is also very meticulously done. Almost nothing is left unused: the light, the set, the characters' names, their speed of movement on the set as well as their casual ideologue are all there to support the main story or to tell a smaller story of their own. Just to give an example, Grace's little ""adventure"" in Dogville runs along with the change of seasons. She appears in town in early spring, gains acceptance from the towns' people in full spring and lives her happiest times in summer. The downside of her experience, or the decline of Dogville starts at summer-end and continues degrading throughout the autumn and early winter. The ending comes as a circle that closes, with the judgment night that is performed in a full winter night.",Dogville

The comments on human nature, stated within the film, as well as implicity by Von Trier are provocative. Unless there is something I missed then I'm curious as to what it is that Grace has done, or what it is that we can be lead to assume? We find out her relation the Boss, but I don't see exactly what it is that she is running from, at least in terms of her own culpability. I would contend that she is guilty of the arrogance that her dad avows is her weakness (ironically, it is the same arrogance that offends him as she accuses him of the same possession). Someone please expound on this. I also have not done the research to figure out a further importance of Thomas Edison Jr. Besides a particular similarity to Alva Edison in terms of ""arrogance"", I wonder if Edison Jr.'s character was created for a greater, almost literary function.",Dogville

The drear stark set was insulting to the senses. It was painfully, painfully slow. But I stuck with it. As the whole town became corrupted (absurdly so) by the power they have over the woman they chose to protect, the story becomes just more and more absurd. The viewer is asked to go beyond reasonable suspension of disbelief as the film maker tries to prove a point, but it doesn't work. As the townies begin to institutionalize their brutality and cruelty (supposedly symbolizing the US, or the US citizens), and the victim (symbolizing other countries or people over which/whom the US and US citizens would supposedly have power) allows herself to be humiliated constantly, with no end in sight, the viewer is struck by this point -if the film is making a statement about the heavy hand of the US, it has to be equally about the complicity of the 'victim'.The best part was the end when she allowed her father's thugs to kill every last horrible stereotypical inhabitant of this ridiculous town.",Dogville
536,Ethigirl777,Amazing,10,7 December 2005,This movie took me by surprise because I didn't expect it to be so amazing. When the film first started I was kind of disappointed because the set was comprised of chalk drawings and few walls so you could see through every thing. But this worked to the film's advantage because I had to imagine those things and it helps you concentrate on the characters actions. This film felt so raw and honest but it was also disturbing because of it's portrayal of human nature. When Chuck is talking to Grace about the Town fooling her with it's exterior goodness he is foreshadowing the evil that will eventually reveal itself from each town member. Tom who appeared to be her only friend in the town of Dogville is the worst offender of them all because his deception is sneaky. He pretended to be her friend even when he was plotting behind her back. He couldn't even betray her her face to face like all the others until the very end. In the end of the film when Grace decides to kill everyone in the town I rejoiced because I felt they deserved it. Even when Grace says she wants Vera to watch as her children get shot I still didn't have any qualms with her actions. In fact I think that Grace let them off easy by shooting them. They deserved as much pain as they have inflicted on her. I am a person that does not agree with revenge or the death penalty because I don't think humans have the right to play God. And I know this is just a fictional movie but nonetheless it does address the reality of human nature and against my beliefs I could not help but to side with Grace at the end. This film will be one that resonates with me because of the powerful acting and unconventional set!,Dogville
537,LibraryBitch,"A Message That Is Difficult To See, But There If You Look For It",10,5 December 2005,"Dogville is certainly a different film when compared to most we see, but it is the eccentricities of this film which make it work. The set design is phenomenal, with the town essentially a large theatre stage where the power of imagination is required to envision pretty much everything. However, the minimalistic design is done with purpose, to highlight one of many themes running throughout the film; that of a small-town mentality, where everyone knows (and can see) everyone else's business, where it is all transparent, or ""see-through"" (to quote the film), yet a blind eye is turned in favor of harmony amongst the neighbors.Speaking of themes, many of the comments regarding Dogville speak of an anti-American sentiment, as well as a message supporting the justification of revenge. It is understandable how one can make such an assumption, yet when looked at more deeply, the film offers far more overarching messages than simply America=bad and revenge=good.As far as the anti-American sentiment is concerned, it is entirely possible that America was what the director had in mind. Every storyteller does have an inspiration point, after all, and certainly the end credits, as well as the town being set in Colorado, suggest that the director was perhaps commenting on something he felt he saw within American culture, or at least a particular segment of it. However, the message that is sent about culture, that being that human beings are inherently selfish and greedy, focused on their own desires ahead of everyone else's, can be applied in virtually every society, and thus the message of the film spreads far beyond simply a statement about America to a larger, more general statement about humanity and the darkness that resides within. We are all guilty of pursuing our own desires at the expense of others from time to time, and the indictment of that part of humanity, played out by the townsfolk in their exploitation of the character of Grace, their own search for a sense of power, is a piece of the message of this film.Grace represents the other side of humanity, the side that has hope, the side that is beautiful and idealistic and believes in the good of all, the side of humanity that will sympathize with the wrongdoers and absolve them of their actions, finding reason where there is little, no matter how horrendous their deeds. Is it no coincidence that the character is named Grace, the very act of compassion and mercy? But what happens? If you've seen the film, you know the ending, which I won't give completely away other than to say a certain revenge is enacted. Is it a justification of revenge itself, to say people deserve what they get, and thank you and goodnight? No.The message given by the ending of the film is one of forewarning. Not the forewarning that revenge will come to the horrible people. Because Grace herself is not an innocent in the end, returning to the life from which she had run, which pretty much blows that message out of the water.Rather than a justification, the message is an indictment. The message is, simply, ""look what someone can become"". Grace's idealism, her hope, her mercy, are all destroyed by the time the film reaches its climax, replaced by cynicism, anger, and her own quest for power. The film drives home the point that the exploitation of the goodness of others for one's own selfish gains only serves to destroy that goodness, and potentially replace it with something far more menacing: hatred.Grace's revenge is not justified; were it, her character would have escaped to the idyllic life she desired, and not returned to the life she had longed to escape. Her own punishment is the loss of her idealism, and her goodness, along with her resignation to a life she had so desperately tried to leave behind.Frankenstein created a monster, and paid for it with an unjust punishment, reaping the very seeds he had sown. So too did the town of Dogville, in this exceptionally well-crafted, and well-acted, film about the dark side of the human mind.",Dogville

It didn't feel like it offered a message, other than that strangers do strange things. And I suppose the other lesson is that people are mean.

Unfortunately that is as good as it gets as the story is trite and its narrative curve wholly predictable. The performances are wooden in the extreme - possibly deliberately so as a (pointless) stylistic device. The voice over narration gets increasingly irritating and self-satisfied. The dialogue is hopelessly intellectual. The characters are completely detached from their reality. Even the predictable ending which should come as a relief and catharsis is shot in a distant way to ensure the viewer has no emotional contact with the film at any point throughout the whole dreary overlong movie.

The writer/director of this movie should face a similar punishment to that befallen to the characters at the end of the movie for forcing me to sit through such a wretched piece of garbage. This movie attempts to convey a certain evil in all mankind, a lack of justice in all mankind, and a certain understanding of a culture this writer obviously knows nothing about. The only thing men can do is Rape. The only thing women can do is scream about their men sleeping with other women. The only thing society wants is its own slaves. In this movie's world, no one stands up for justice, or liberty. No one takes to heart the suffering of the innocent, or does anything to stop it. I find it I ironic that the writer meant to criticize American society in this movie. America, where the first notions of free, democratic society took place. America, which exported its ideals of justice throughout the world. America, whose founding fathers were able to stand up for justice and liberty. And yes, I know of all the bad things this country has done to, but America is no Dogville, and the writer of this movie should wake up and realize how much worse life could be if the British, Romans, Greeks, Mongols, Nazis, or any of the other previous world hegemonies influenced the world today.
