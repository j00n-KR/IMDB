0,Leofwine_draca,Well-directed actioner,7,3 March 2019,"PEPPERMINT is another superior Hollywood action thriller, heavily influenced by the likes of JOHN WICK and all the better for it. Jennifer Garner - experienced in the genre with the likes of ALIAS and ELECTRA - plays an ordinary housewife and mother whose life is transformed after a family tragedy. After a five-year gap, she returns gunning for revenge to become one of cinema's better heroines in recent years. Although PEPPERMINT doesn't have a wealth of action scenes, the characters and storyline are interesting enough for this to work. There's a level of stark brutality to the movie that gives it a layer of gritty realism, and thankfully Pierre Morel retains the crisp roving cinematography he brought to the likes of TAKEN and THE GUNMAN.",Peppermint
1,SnoopyStyle,Mrs. Deathwish,3,12 December 2018,"Riley North (Jennifer Garner) and her husband Chris are struggling working class suburban parents. Chris turns down a robbery scheme against ruthless drug lord Diego Garcia. He and his daughter are shot down in a drive by as the drug lord uncovers the failed plan. The three thugs escape justice in a corrupt trial. Five years later, Riley returns to L.A. to set up base on skid row. She's on a mission to kill all who wronged her family and take down Diego Garcia.When the judge dismissed the case, I had to clap in ridicule. It's staged like the criminals had bought out the entire courtroom. There is no reality and no subtlety. Along with Riley becoming Rambo, those are the most problematic aspects of this movie. Riley should have been a retired assassin or a former soldier instead of simply a harried suburban mom. As for her kills, it would be so much more compelling for her to kill each one of the thugs in succession. The movie spends time showing off these thugs but they mostly get killed off screen. The kill sequencing should be the thugs, the judge, and the defense lawyer. She recovers the lawyer's files and a detailed map of the criminal organization. At which point, she can go after Diego Garcia. As a basic Deathwish idea, there is nothing wrong with a vigilante B-action thriller. It's the execution that is the problem.",Peppermint
2,boblipton,And Puff It In Your Face,5,15 July 2020,"Because I am very fond of Jennifer Garner, I easily agreed when my cousin suggested we see this movie It was directed by Pierre Morel, who also directed The Transporter and Taken, so I went in expecting to see a lot of mindless ass-whupping done in a cinematically interesting although barely believable style, and that's what I got.The story, for those of you who think that still matters, is that back when, Miss Garner was married to Chris Noth with a cute daughter. Money was tight, and he phoned his friend saying No,I'm not going to help you steal from the drug kingpin"" to his answering machine. Apparently, even thinking about such things can get you killed, which happens to Noth and the little girl.Miss Garner identifies the killers, but the judge dismisses, so she goes away and come back, looking for vengeance or, as she puts it, ""justice."" This, of course, involves much blood and many things that go boom.Miss Garner actually limps after being shot, and in the alternate universe in which she lives, Internet comments use the word ""alleged"" when talking about gang bangers.It's certainly not a great movie, but Miss Garner, despite her talent, has placed herself on the movie actress' equivalent of ""midlist author."" I expect she will continue to star in this sort of movie, support in others, and have a very satisfactory career.",Peppermint
3,claudio_carvalho,The Vigilante,7,18 May 2020,"In Los Angeles, Riley North (Jennifer Garner) and her husband Chris North (Jeff Hephner) go to a carnival to celebrate the birthday of their ten years old daughter Carly North (Cailey Fleming). However, a friend of Chris had invited him to rob the powerful drug lord Diego Garcia (Juan Pablo Raba) and although Chris did not accept the offer, Diego discovers his involvement and orders his men to kill the North family. Chris and Carly are murdered and Riley survives, and Detective Stan Carmichael (John Gallagher Jr.) and Detective Moises Beltran (John Ortiz) arrest the criminals. Riley identifies them but a corrupt judge releases the criminals claiming lack of evidences. Riley vanishes and five years later, the criminals are found dead in the Carnival where Chris and Carly were killed. FBI Agent Lisa Inman (Annie Ilonzeh) goes to Los Angeles and explains that Riley robbed the bank where she worked and moved to Asia, where she became a fighter. Now she has returned to Los Angeles and robbed a gun store and is beginning her vengeance seeking out justice to her family. The police with the support of the FBI and Diego's gang are hunting her down.""Peppermint"" is a highly entertaining action film of revenge. The plot is the traditional story of injustice and vengeance, and Jennifer Garner performs a great vigilante. When a viewer watches a film with this storyline, he or she expect to see exactly what ""Peppermint"" offers. For fans of series, Annie ""Emily Foster"" Ilonzeh from ""Chicago Fire"" and Cailey ""Judith Grimes"" Fleming from ""The Walking Dead"" are wonderful surprises in a feature. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Justiceira"" (""The Vigilante"")",Peppermint
4,nogodnomasters,What's in your AK-47?,9,29 September 2018,"Riley North (Jennifer Garner) loses her family in a drive-by. The crooked judge, police, and DA let the criminals go as they are part of Diego Garcia's drug mob. Five years later Riley shows back up in LA a lean mean fighting machine without a music montage showing her training. Just snippets. As you can guess, she becomes a vengeful vigilante. I liked the film. Jennifer Garner is not whom I would expect for such a role and they could have elaborated on her five years in exile more than what they did. Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Peppermint
5,classicsoncall,"""Everywhere she goes, people get dead.""",6,11 November 2020,"The headliner in this story could have been Keanu Reeves, Liam Neeson or Jason Statham, but the film makers decided to put Jennifer Garner in the top spot to take a break from the world of elite male assassins. As a stand alone picture, and if you've never seen another one similar to it, it's entertaining enough, but if you try to assign any credibility to the story, forget about it. Even given Riley North's (Jennifer Garner ) five year globe hopping seminar in extreme martial arts, it wouldn't have been enough to take on an entire Mexican cartel gang. Ask yourself, how did she manage to hang the three thugs who killed her husband and daughter in a targeted drive by killing to open the story? On top of a ferris wheel, no less! Or how in the world could she have possibly known who the two Mexicans were who blew up Diego Garcia's (Juan Pablo Raba) warehouse, much less been able to locate them making a getaway on a deserted road? Nothing here passes the sniff test, but if you're a Jennifer Garner fan, it might suggest a look see if you like action pics. But don't expect much in the way of an original story, it follows along at a pretty recognizable pace to it's final destination. And if you're wondering how the title fits into the movie, think a holiday flavored ice cream. Makes perfect sense.",Peppermint
6,michaelRokeefe,A young mother transforms,8,7 September 2020,"Riley North (Jennifer Garner) awakens from a coma after losing her husband and young daughter in a brutal attack on her family. The murderers are shielded from justice and Riley takes it on herself to channel her frustration and motivation into and unstoppable badass fighting machine. She methodically spreads her personal brand of revenge. This movie confirmed my thinking that Garner is HOT! She carries the lead with no problem. Also featured are John Gallagher Jr., John Ortiz, Eddie Shin, Cliff ""Method Man' Smith, Annie Ilonzeh and Juan Pablo Raba.",Peppermint
7,CinemaSerf,Dreadful stuff...,5,8 November 2019,"Preposterous, derivative nonsense with barely an original idea in either the script or in the mind's eye of the director. One minute she's a quiet suburban mother, the next a lethal killer who makes Lara Croft look like Mother Theresa. Straight to video as they used to say....",Peppermint
8,zardoz-13,Good Vigilante Thriller With A Woman Pulling The Trigger,8,15 September 2018,"Imagine what the Liam Neeson abduction thriller ""Taken"" (2008) might have been had a woman wreaked havoc galore, and you'll have a fair idea what director Pierre Morel's ""Peppermint"" sets out to accomplish, casting ""Alias"" actress Jennifer Garner as a vengeful mom. Incidentally, Pierre Morel knows something about violent vigilante thrillers since he helmed ""Taken."" Moreover, Morel is no stranger to actioneers, with films such as ""District B-13,"" ""From Paris With Love,"" and ""The Gunman"" on his resume. At 102 minutes, this exciting but predictable revenge epic adheres to the sure-fire formula with one surprise and stacks of villains riddled with lead. Jennifer Garner is a revelation as the vengeance-fueled wife/mom who devastates a Mexican cartel venture. She looks believable, and she could probably pen a book about the regimen she endured to acquire her slim but muscular physique. Unfortunately, our heroine's transition from a happily married bank manager to a pistol-packing Dirty Harriett occurs off-screen, so ""Peppermint"" leaves us with ambiguous feelings about her familiarity with firearms. Unless you catch yourself thinking about this missing episode during the movie, then it doesn't pose a problem. Garner qualifies as a sympathetic heroine not without some flaws, and audiences are supposed to applaud for her just as we did Bruce Willis in the latest ""Death Wish"" movie. The unpardonable flaw is her cartel adversaries. In a movie like ""Peppermint"" half of the fun is watching the bad guys get their just comeuppance in the most excruciating way. Sadly, the Hispanic henchmen with facial tattoos galore flourish their submachine guns with the same abandon as Tinker Bell waved her wand. Stone-cold killers without qualm, they display no sympathy for anyone, and they pull their triggers without blinking. These are the rudimentary elements in ""London Has Fallen"" scenarist Chad St. John's exciting, but by-the-numbers screenplay. The villains rank as impersonal plug-uglies, with little that makes them memorable. Actor Juan Pablo Raba doesn't make much of a one-dimensional impression as the narcotics chieftain. He has a sadistic gleam in his eyes, but he behaves without exception like every stereotypical cartel honcho. The set-up in ""Peppermint"" is the best part. The premise has Riley North's straight-arrow husband Chris (Steve Carrell look-alike Jeff Hephner of ""Interstellar""), who owns an auto-repair garage, refusing to drive the getaway car for a friend who wants to rob the mob. The mob in this instance is one of the many cartel clans in Los Angeles. Although Chris backed out of the deal, this doesn't absolve him of the crime he had pondered, and cartel crime boss Diego Garcia (Juan Pablo Raba of ""Shot Caller"") decides to make an example of him to others. Meantime, Firefly den mother Riley (Jennifer Garner of ""The Kingdom"") and her nine-year girl, Carly (Cailey Fleming of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens""), are leaving a Firefly cookie sale when another Firefly mom, Peg (Pell James of ""Zodiac""), with her own daughter, denounces Riley for invading their territory for the cookie sales. As it turns out, Carly's birthday was supposed to take place later that evening, but Riley missed it because her boss made her close the suburban bank where she works as a part-time manager. The spat with spiteful Peg destroys the prospect of Carly's party, because Peg invited all of Carly's friends to her own daughter's festivity. Meantime, Chris and Riley celebrate Carly's birthday with ice cream and a whirl on a Ferris wheel. Three Hispanics with machine guns ambush Chris and Riley as they are leaving. Chris dies in a fusillade of gunfire along with his daughter Carly, but Riley miraculously survives with a head wound. LAPD Detective Stan Carmichael (John Gallagher Jr. of ""Jonah Hex"") and his partner, Detective Moises Beltran (John Ortiz of ""Public Enemies"") convince Riley after she recovers from her gunshot wound to testify against the three Hispanics. Alas, the cartel has already gotten into gear for the trial. The cartel's defense attorney tries to bribe Riley, but she refuses to take a gaping envelope stuffed with $100 bills. This attorney spots her medication and uses it to undermine her credibility as a witness. A corrupt judge, Stevens (Jeff Harlan of ""Auto Focus""), dismisses the case, and he orders a disruptive Riley sent to a sanitarium. The bailiffs taze when she tries to attack the three suspects. Afterward, as the paramedics are loading a distraught Riley into an ambulance, she surprises not only them, but also Detective Carmichael and clobbers him with an oxygen bottle. This gives Riley ample time to escape and vanish into thin air. About five years later, Riley returns to L.A. with lethal skills which enable her to give the cartel a taste of its own medicine. Now, not only must Diego contend with a rabid lone wolf assassin, but also his own cartel bosses are scrutinizing him with suspicions eyes because he cannot account for some missing narcotics.Efficiently helmed from start to finish, director Pierre Morel never lets the momentum slacken in ""Peppermint."" Five years later, our heroine returns, she carries out several strikes against the cartel that leaves them hurting. Soon enough, the FBI launches an investigation, too. Now, Riley has to deal with not only the cartel, but also corrupt as well as honest lawmen. Morel orchestrates the noisy shootouts and the close-quarters combat encounters with high-octane explosions and white-knuckled suspense. Occasionally, our heroine behaves like a rank amateur, such as when she steals assault weapons from a gun dealer's inventory without wearing anything to conceal her identity. Under fire, however, she performs like a trooper, blasting away with extreme prejudice at the murderous brutes that obliterated her family. Happily, Morel doesn't take a chronological approach to the storytelling. He opens up the movie with our tempered-like-steel heroine killing a cartel gunmen in his car at a secluded rendezvous. While the violence is largely standard-issue, and the filmmakers shun sexual violence in any form, ""Peppermint"" doesn't always hold up under the burden of its implausibility.",Peppermint
9,Calicodreamin,Kick ass,7,3 December 2020,Has the suburban parent turned revenge killer plot been done before? Yes. But It's still awesome. Gardner had the perfect mix of bad ass gun skills and a stone cold killer face. Storyline was well developed and decent acting. A nice loose ending to keep us guessing.,Peppermint
10,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Go for the Garner, stay for the satisfaction",7,1 October 2018,"Jennifer truly delivers, as she always does when playing badasses. From what I've seen she does when playing family friendly roles, as well. But I'm not that interested in those. Anyway. Given the reception this has gotten, which it somewhat deserves, perhaps this won't mark a return to this genre of film for her. That is really too bad as her performance is the best thing about this. She portrays Riley North, who, after tragically losing her family, finds the legal system refusing to help her. In fact, it goes so far as to punish her. One of the few places that the supposed ""feminist girl-power"" overtones of this are actually present. A man showing passion is seen as strong whilst a woman doing the same is considered hysterical.Despite being a half-hearted effort pretty much across the board, other than stuff like the bewildering decision to have 2 of the 3 drive-by-shooters die offscreen, this does mostly give you what you came for. Dozens are killed before our eyes, in cool and occasionally memorable ways. It's sufficiently entertaining, though it doesn't go above and beyond. It's not going to surprise you. Not everything needs to.Throughout this, there is strong language, as well as bloody, brutal, sometimes gory, violence. I recommend it to anyone who every so often indulges in the guilty pleasure of the Conservative fantasy of ""cleaning up the streets"" by covering it with the bodies of evildoers. 7/10",Peppermint
11,phd_travel,Extremely satisfying vigilante movie - Jennifer Garner rocks!,10,6 September 2018,"If you think you have seen enough of these family wiped out vigilante movies with JCVD or whoever well think again. This movie is very exciting and enjoyable, with everything fun to watch in this kind of movie. The bad guys from hit-men to bad judges, to evil soccer moms get their comeupance, there is just enough of a small twist, Jennifer is the super vigilante without being too unrealistic. She is really good at this kind of role - better than in rom-coms and weepies that she has been in recently. It is delightful to anticipate and then witness her meet out punishment and accomplish what the DEA can't. Don't let the slightly frothy title put you off. A must watch.",Peppermint
12,gradyharp,Strange applause....,8,21 June 2020,"An odd feeling of support for criminal acts emerges from this tense drama written by Chad St. John and directed by Pierre Morel. The story of the unmitigated revenge of a woman who is denied legal support from a corrupt system when her family is killed is at once terrifying and an act worthy of applause as she gradually destroys all the participants in the evil inflicted upon her.The lead in to the story is solid - the violent loss of Riley North's (Jennifer Garner) family and the ill-fated trial of the perpetrators by a corrupt system - but the action truly begins when Riley steps out of five years' exile and gradually murders all the people responsible, from the presiding judge at the trial, to the various 'bad cops' and the drug cartel. Despite the constant barrage of realistic violence, the audience becomes supportive of Riley's mission - largely due in part to Jennifer Garner's fine acting and the supporting cast who make the incidents credible - John Gallagher Jr., Moises Beltran, Juan Pablo Raba, Ian Casselberry, et al.When a film of such violent content can instill a sense of support for the lead character, the question arises - why do we tolerate injustice? This is a challenging film that places such questions before us.",Peppermint
13,trashgang,Jennifer Garner is back,7,17 August 2019,"Exactly what I said in my summary, Jennifer is back. After the much acclaimed Alias series Jennifer left the action to move forward to more comedy or romantic flicks so I lost track of her due that reason. Let Daredevil (2003) be an exception.Completely forgotten a friend of mine mentioned that Jennifer was back in an action. And here it is, a pure revenge flick in the style Death Wish or Taken, you know what I mean.Worth seeing if you like it rough because it's all done on-camera with all the blood included. Story ofcourse is predictable and does match so many revenge flicks. I was surprised that Jennifer still has the skills to fight like in Daredevil or Alias.If you're in rough action flicks this is for you, if you want romantic flicks, skipp this one because it's not your usual Jennifer. Hope she moves back to this genre.

14,deloudelouvain,Jennifer Garner as a vigilante? Yeah right...,4,17 December 2018,"If there is one genre of movies I normally do enjoy all the time it's revenge movies. Maybe it's because of my no high opinion about the law, police forces, lawyers and judges. That whole world is corrupt to the bone, with favoritism for those who have money. So the story of Peppermint totally fits in a movie that I might like. And the beginning was promising, but the more the movie advanced the lesser I liked it. Let's face it, Jennifer Garner as the vigilante, is absolutely ludicrous. That she could kill a couple guys is already hard to believe, but her killing a whole hardcore drug gang and others, and this of course in commando style, is just laughable and at one point just painful to watch. If you want to watch a better pretty woman vigilante movie just watch I Spit On Your Grave instead, as that one is at least a bit convincing. Peppermint didn't give me any revenge satisfaction at all.",Peppermint
15,siderite,A by the numbers revenge flick with nothing new to bring to the table,6,5 October 2020,"The only good thing about this film was the soundtrack, really. The villains were ridiculous, the protagonist forgot she is not Electra sometime during the filming and the police/FBI were clowns. Not one character was sympathetic, and that includes the grieving mother who wants revenge from a Latino mob boss. Even the fight scenes were tired cliches.And the funny thing is that the beginning of the film showed promise, when she started making the gangs fight each other. Something like this had a lot more sense plus bring a feel of real retribution than a diminutive house wife learning to fight and shoot.Pointless movie. When it wasn't bad it was unrealistic.",Peppermint
16,blanbrn,"A nice action and drama revenge flick, a kick butt kind of chick!",7,9 September 2018,"""Peppermint"" is one film that as you watch you enjoy the action and fighting scenes of punches, fights, and blood drama. Plus it's nice to see the lead character being a female who dishes out the punishment. Jennifer Garner is Riley North a mother and wife living in L.A. and all of a sudden her world is turned upside down when thugs and Mexican drug cartels take the life of her husband and daughter.And of course the liberal justice system lets Riley down as their is no justice only years later a transformation takes place as Riley decides to destroy the enemies all along while dealing with corruption and going against the system. This is one bad mom a female superhero who kicks criminal butt! Overall good action film that's go against the grain still, do it your own way produces justice.",Peppermint

18,Lejink,Peppermint no twist,4,25 December 2018,"Strange to find myself watching this shoot 'em up fest on Christmas Eve but oddly enough the film does start and end at Christmas time although whether it will ever jostle with ""Die Hard"" for a disputed inclusion in lists of classic Christmas movies I would somehow doubt.The plot of the film is like that of a female Batman as Jennifer Garner sees her husband and kid daughter ruthlessly shot down by the hired henchmen of a drug overlord, just after they've attended the Christmas Carnival, coincidentally falling on the little girl's birthday. When the trial of the three gunmen, who must be the easiest picks ever in an identikit parade, gets thrown out due to a combination of corrupted counsel, police and judiciary, Garner takes off for five years, presumably in the process honing her fighting and weaponry skills until she's ready to come back for vengeance although unlike Bruce Wayne, she has no intention of bringing her gangster quarry to stand trial, no, she will be judge jury and executioner in time honoured Hollywood vigilante process.It's all too ridiculous for words as she mows down felon after felon, escaping death each time by seconds in the process as she works her way up to the drugs kingpin himself and the crooked cop acting as an inside man for the big boss. Surprisingly, little fuss is made about the prosecuting counsel in the villain's pocket who firstly threatens her and then rips her legal testimony apart in court to get the murderers off (although just to make sure, the presiding judge is bought too), I really thought she'd do a number on him.Anyway, by the end she's the last woman standing amongst a body count of dispatched hoodlums which must run to dozens. It's all very violent with ninja-type fight scenes and computer-games action with almost no leavening humour apart from a karma moment she later achieves with an uppity neighbour who originally tried to spoil her little girl's party on the fateful night.This type of graphic action feature isn't really my thing unless there are super heroes running or flying around but for what it was, it was okay.",Peppermint
19,ThomasDrufke,Unfortunately Forgettable,4,14 September 2018,"I wish this film turned out better, but watching Jennifer Garner return to action in a bland and at times uncomfortably violent thriller, was less than rewarding. When I say uncomfortable, what I really mean is that the film produced senseless violence that served more to rid Garner's character of humanity than it was to excite the audience. Instead of gaining our sympathy and cheers as she goes on her revenge tour to kill the people who wronged her family, I found myself asking ""was this the best route to take this story?"". Not that I don't find some of it thrilling, but it just ended up being more style over substance. Actually, there wasn't much style either. Sigh...4.5/10",Peppermint
20,cricketbat,Peppermint is only average and easily forgotten,6,31 December 2018,"Much like those little red & white striped candies, Peppermint is only average and easily forgotten. It's a paint-by-numbers revenge story, with the only real difference being that Jennifer Garner is in the lead role. And while Garner is completely believable as she doles out vigilante justice, the story glosses over some key plot points that would have made the movie stronger.",Peppermint
21,A_Different_Drummer,action film and sci fi both,7,2 November 2019,"Again the critics missed the point. Great production values, cinematography. It is of course revenge porn - duh! -- and also sci fi. The 47 year old Garner uses the latest medical technology to play a 30 year old soccer mom -- and pretty much pulls it off.",Peppermint
22,CuriosityKilledShawn,Butterscotch,4,25 January 2020,"Is there anything more formulaic than a revenge thriller? Perhaps a romantic comedy? Jennifer Garner can now call herself a veteran of both, but the romantic comedy has thankfully disappeared over the last decade while trashy action movies still find their way to cinema screens. In the 1980s Peppermint would be a shameless Cannon Films vehicle and star either Cynthia Rothrock or Chelsea Field. In 2017 it's a starring role for the underused Garner who seems to have let her career take a backseat while she raises her ungrateful husband's children.Still trying to sell herself as 35, the 45-year-old Garner is Riley North, a working class mother doing her best to raise her daughter and keep her household afloat. When her husband and child are killed in a senseless drive-by she wakes from a coma weeks later to find them already dead and buried while the killers are set free on a ludicrous technicality. Riley then disappears off the face of the Earth for five years only to suddenly show up once more leaving a trail of dead bodies behind her.As purile and tawdry as it is, Peppermint could have been a lot better. Taken director Pierre Morel appeals to our primal desire for bloodlust and payback but damn is this film U-G-L-Y. The setting of modern-day Los Angeles captures the grottiness often unseen in movies that still portray it as a sunny paradise and not the homeless hellhole it has become but there's no need for such dour, static, empty, drab cinematography and epileptic editing. The production values of this movie could have been found in the discount bin at the 99-cent store. Cheap, quick, and nasty, and with noticeably obvious deleted scenes that were likely cut for pacing but leaves a lot unexplained.This is a lazy, by-the-numbers dumpster fire and it probably would have been better if it were made in 1985 for a quarter of the budget.The title is also meaningless, btw.",Peppermint
23,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews....,6,13 December 2018,"PeppermintThe best way to get drug dealers out of your neighbourhood is to open a methadone clinic.Mind you, the mom in this action movie is more interested in dismantling the cartel.When her husband gets mixed up with a kingpin, mild-mannered mom Riley (Jennifer Garner) loses both him and their daughter in a drive-by shooting. Frustrated over the lack of police involvement in the case, Riley takes matters in to her own hands. After months of combat training and target practice, she returns to the streets looking for payback.While Garner does a serviceable job of working with the hackneyed material, this derivative tale of retribution is par for the course, save for the female lead. However, the melodramatic nature and improbability of the whole affair is pure cult movie material.And now that the drug dealers are off the streets, it's finally safe to open recreational cannabis stores.

Only, in this case, the novelty is that it's the female who suddenly becomes a killing ninja. Unfortunately the suddenness of this transformation from housewife to mob & police fearing assassin wasn't even closely reasonably shown/explained.

25,tabuno,"Roaring back with emotional sensitivity, touches of humor, and hard-hitting action",9,28 January 2019,"Jennifer Garner of television's kick-ass Alias (2001-2006) fame and the highly under-rated and overlooked superhero in Elektra (2005) has come roaring back with a surprisingly emotional sensitive, at times touched with delicate humor, and hard-hitting action that thrills with its raw power and energy. The background story flashback is given a decent amount of screen time to develop a personal, bonding, and critical familial attachment with the audience. Even the inevitable soft-twist avoids having the audience to bring to bear any tremendous amount of mental gyrations to understand what happened in regards to suspenseful surprises. The script and Jennifer Garner's performance resembles a more rough hewn Jason Bourne from The Bourne Identity (2002). There are echoes of the male-driven assassin genre movies Taken (2008), John Wick (2014), and Jack Reacher (2012).

27,UniqueParticle,Jennifer Garner is so awesome!,8,5 February 2020,I wish I saw this way sooner either way I love it and the way it was filmed! Grotesque action fun experience with stylish camera shots among other really cool stuff. I'm glad Peppermint has fairly decent ratings damn well deserves it; I like the way it was written as well. Garner should do more action roles I don't think she's hasn't done enough good ones plus John Gallagher Jr is great in several movies.,Peppermint
28,paulclaassen,Way too many flaws...,5,5 December 2019,"I generally enjoy revenge movies (just not John Wick, please!!), but they have to be done right. 'Peppermint' started off with the right recipe, but as it progressed they added way too many ingredients, stirring it much too vigorously.Jennifer Garner is excellent in a very demanding role. She was equally good at portraying affection and hatred. Her role was also very physical, and she excelled every step of the way. Sadly, though, the script isn't that great, with too many flaws. There's eventually also way too much killing - similar to the John Wick films. This makes me beg the question: is she really a heroin or did she become a ruthless mass murderer? All the killings goes beyond vengeance.There's a scene where she goes after the guys who blew up the lab, but she never saw them, so how did she know it was them? The audience knows it, but how did she? When she takes their car, she casually goes to the boss (Diego)'s residence. How did she know where he stays and that everyone there were indeed bad guys who deserved to die - since she randomly kills everyone at the house. It would have made sense if she's been watching him, but this should have been shown if it was the case. Much of this, I believe, was for effect only, but in the process disregarded credibility and made me question her actions.Also, when she was injured, why did she go to Peg's house? To her about a childish quarrel from five years ago? This served no purpose whatsoever and was ridiculous, to say the least. It made absolutely no sense.I enjoyed the film's first half, and the final act, which dished up some twists and surprises. Why is the film called 'Peppermint', though? It has no significance and the only relevance to the film, is that it was the last thing Riley's daughter had before she was killed (peppermint flavored ice cream). It is never mentioned, so it doesn't make sense calling the film 'Peppermint'.",Peppermint
29,cruise01,Jennifer Garner brings her A game in an action role in a revenge movie that is lacking story and development.,6,8 September 2018,"Peppermint (3 out of 5 stars).Peppermint is an okay vigilante film. Which is everything you can expect for a revenge story type of movie. Some decent action sequences, Jennifer Garner being a bada** and taking on an action role, and a straightforward revenge plot involving a cartel, corrupt police, and judges. Definitely, one of those flicks were you just go to the theatre to escape and watch Jennifer Garner beat down the bad guys. The plot follows Riley (Jennifer Garner) who survives a drive by shooting which her husband and daughter were not so lucky. After finding out from detective Carmichael (John Gallagher Jr.) that the suspects are members of a cartel. And after the judges let the bad guys go. Riley takes justice to her own hands. She comes back, tracking down, and hunting every bad guy, corrupt police, and judges that are linked to the cartel. Director Pierre Morel (who also did the first Taken movie) did deliver a simple basic revenge plot. Sure, it may not be anything new that we have seen differently with revenge movies. A woman loses her family. And she just goes after every bad guy there is. Not really much you can say about the plot. Morel did deliver some entertaining action. Garner taking up arms and shooting up bad guys was entertaining. She takes a beating, gets injured, and gets back up to fight again. Jennifer Garner was great in delivering an action role. It is nice to see her back in the action genre ever since Daredevil. John Ortiz was okay playing a detective that is hot on Riley's trail. John Gallagher Jr. was decent playing the detective as well. Juan Pablo Raba playing the villain was good. But these actors do not really have much to work with. Peppermint may not be a great worth talking about action film. It is better than Bruce Willis Death Wish film. There are better revenge type movies like 2004 Man on Fire, The Punisher, or even Death Sentence. This film barely had much of a story, just setting up Jennifer Garner going to one bad guys safe house to another. With a set piece of shoot outs and her escaping to another. Plus the action does get a little repetitive and not worth talking about. Especially, when the director uses some close up camera shots were you do not care much about what is going on. Overall, Peppermint is a fair vigilante film. It could be worse. The action shoot up sequences are decent. Jennifer Garner is at her finest with the role while the rest of the cast are playing undeveloped characters. And a thin story which makes this film forgettable.",Peppermint
30,Tweetienator,Just Another Amazon's Fail,4,23 November 2018,"I like Jennifer Garner (Elektra, Daredevil, Operation.

""Peppermint"" is a solid entry in that genre. Jennifer Garner gives a very nice performance. The rest of the cast is also very good. The movie looks good and moves well with very little downtime. The story may be a little farfetched at times but that's okay. A good cast goes a long way and usually outweighs any weakness in a script.

37,jtindahouse,A good film that had the potential to be a great film,7,30 January 2019,"I liked 'Peppermint' a lot, but I know I could have liked it a lot more had it made some tweaks to the way things were done in certain aspects. The following review may come across as slightly negative, but these are more just things that could have made a good film a great one. Firstly, the film did a great job in making all the villains in this movie absolutely despicable scum who you desperately wanted to see get their karma. It was a little disappointing then that a lot of the revenge murders, especially early on, were off-camera and the audience only got to see the aftermath. I would've loved for this film to get really gritty and go to almost 'I Spit on Your Grave' levels with things.The film also sometimes feels like it can't decide what it wants to be. The tone is very unlevelled. At times it feels like it wants to be a very heavy cop drama. Then the next it wants to be a light cop drama. Then a very heavy vigilante story, followed by a very light vigilante story (after the final moment of the movie I don't know what to think). It never fully commits in any direction.Jennifer Garner is good, again without being great. She put a lot of work into the role in terms of the physical side of things and it certainly shows. Just her line delivery and overall acting ability can be a little lacking at times which is often a distraction in the film. As with most cop movies there is some sloppy writing in places too, just to make certain scenes more cinematic and drama-filled. I did like the twist in the film. I didn't see it coming and I thought it fit in nicely and made me rethink a lot of things. 'Peppermint' is a film that I would recommend, but I still feel it could have been even better than it ultimately turned out.",Peppermint
38,stevendbeard,Female Punisher,8,9 September 2018,"I saw ""Peppermint"", starring Jennifer Garner-Miracles From Heaven, Alias_tv; John Gallagher Jr.-10 Cloverfield Lane, Jonah Hex; John Ortiz-Kong:Skull Island, Fast & Furious 6 and Juan Pablo Raba-Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._tv, The 33.
This is an action movie that is directed by Pierre Morel-he directed the first Taken-and the storyline sort of reminds me of a female Punisher. You know, the family of the hero is killed and all out war is declared on the perpetrators. Jennifer is the lone survivor of a drive by shooting that kills her husband and daughter. John G & John O are the detectives that are assigned her case. Juan plays the local drug lord that ordered the shooting. When Jennifer gets out of the hospital-she was wounded-she identifies the shooters but looses in court, due to Juan's influence. Dirty lawyers, cops and even judges are all on his parole so Jennifer goes off the grid for about 5 years. What does she do during that time? Snippets are shown but basically, she trains to get those responsible and make them pay and by the looks of her, she must have trained with John Wick's guys-you know, how to fight and use all kinds of weapons. The fights are brutal and the ending is just crying out for a sequel. FYI: Peppermint was Jennifer's daughters' favorite flavor.
It's rated ""R"" for strong violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 42 minutes.
I loved this movie and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Peppermint

42,kirbylee70-599-526179,SWEET REVENGE,9,4 January 2019,"Where the full throttle action film was once the province of men only that's changed in recent years. Consider the films of Sigourney Weaver, Angelina Jolie and Charlize Theron and you'll see what I mean. Among those women in action films who hasn't taken on that sort of role in a while is Jennifer Garner. Having established herself as an action star in the series ALIAS and the film ELEKTRA she concentrated more on dramatic and comedic roles. It's nice to see her return to the action fold and in a movie that is non-stop action at that.In PEPPERMINT Garner stars as Riley North, an average housewife and bank employee whose husband and young daughter are gunned down by a drug running gang in a drive by. It seems her husband was approached to drive a getaway car for a friend intending on stealing from Diego Garcia (Juan Pablo Raba), the head of the gang, but turned it down. As far as the leader is concerned just being asked is enough.The justice system fails Riley as crooked judges and district attorneys paid off by Diego let his men walk free. When she explodes in the courtroom the judge has her sent to a mental institution. Before she can be taken there she escapes from the ambulance and disappears.Five years later and Riley is back on the scene in Los Angles. She working her way through the Diego's men beginning with the three that killed her family. She sends a clear message by stringing all three up by their heels from the Ferris wheel at the park she and her family were at those five years ago. War has been declared.This time around Riley has caught not only the interest of the police officers she escaped from in the past but the FBI as well. A file has already been begun on her and seen what she's done over those five years. Before she left she stole $50,000 from the bank she worked at. She then roamed the world training herself in everything from weapons usage to hand to hand combat. She's now using that knowledge to take down Diego. Having recently stolen a load of military grade weapons from a local gun store she intends to do some damage.But Riley doesn't take her revenge on just Diego. She also goes after the judge, DA and defense attorney who allowed the corrupt money grubbing ways from getting her the justice she deserved. With the full might of the police and FBI capturing her should be easy. But she's developed new allies as well. The homeless people of the streets have found a champion in her, a protector that they call an angel. When push comes to shove they increase the odds in her favor.Eventually a show down is bound to happen and of course it does. Both good guys gone bad and bad guys who were always that way are taken out one by one. Riley is wounded more than once but does the best battle field triage that she can and soldiers on. She is determined to have her revenge and no one will stand in her way.I could help but think of the character of Paul Kersey in DEATH WISH as played by Charles Bronson while watching this film. He too was driven by revenge to protect the innocent and find the guilty, taking them off the street with instant justice. Both were vigilantes who found support from a public tired of watching bad guys released due to technical issues. Both became legends and heroes of the people.While it's been 12 years since Garner starred in ALIAS she's stayed in shape and ready to show her skills as an action performer on screen. While the odds are plenty of stunt performers were on hand to take care of many of the action scenes Garner was an actress ready to step in when she could. It shows and she brings the character to life not just with those scenes but displaying the anguish of a mother and wife whose life has been turned upside down as well. She's believable and that is what it takes to make the movie work.Director Pierre Morel continues to display his ability to handle action better than most. Responsible for films like DISTRICT B 13, TAKEN and FROM PARIS WITH LOVE he has a knack for capturing the actions sequences with ease and takes an old school approach rather than the new hand-held style that far too many directors use these days. The action here is captured in non-nauseating style and offers truly armrest grabbing scenes.The film is rated R for the violence and blood in the film but the movie would be short changed without it. The story is violent, from the inspiration for Riley's revenge through the revenge she extracts itself. Fans of action films expect that. Here's hoping that the movie generates enough interest that a sequel is in order. I for one would be there ticket in hand.",Peppermint

44,kluseba,A feminist take on John Wick,9,24 September 2018,"Peppermint is at heart a feminist version of John Wick and shows how a mother who lost her family to a drug cartel goes into hiding and comes back five years later to take her pitiless revenge. The story might be simplistic at some points and quite predictable but that is the movie's only minor flaw.Jennifer Garner's performance is stunning as you really root for the hurt family mother who disciplines herself to become a resilient killing machine. The fight scenes are spectacular, involving martial arts elements and well as gun fights. The numerous settings are also used during the movie's numerous ferocious combats. The intense action sequences are interrupted by entertaining scenes showing how police, media and civilians react to the lead character's revenge.If you like spectacular action movies with a dramatic background story and some tension leading to a climatic showdown, you will enjoy every minute of the very compact Peppermint. Despite the predictable story, it's one of the best contemporary action movies I have seen. You will only find better films of that kind in Asia these days. Overrated action actors like the dull Dwayne Johnson should take some notes from a spectacular Jennifer Garner.",Peppermint
45,Pairic,Enjoyable Revenge Thriller,7,4 October 2020,"Peppermint: For some bizarre reason Netflix have tagged this film as Teen. It's actually a violent Revenge/Vigilante movie.

Five years later the trio involved are found hanging by their heels from an LA bridge, Garner is back. She's not satisfied with this though, she wants to wipe out the cartel's operations and kill it's leader. Scenes of extreme violence predominate but as it's mostly the gang members who are shot. stabbed etc this shouldn't be too upsetting, still this is not a film for the squeamish or faint of heart.

47,I_Ailurophile,Absolutely not what I expected,8,28 February 2021,"What do you get when you give a B-movie screenplay a blockbuster production?Riley North watches her husband and daughter get gunned down outside a carnival by the underlings of a violent drug dealer. When the corrupt, broken criminal justice system allows the three shooters to go free, she vanishes and remakes herself. She steals from the bank where she was employed, travels abroad to train in martial arts and other very non-""soccer mom"" subjects, and upon return to the United States 5 years later, embarks on a campaign of revenge against all those responsible.None of these things are actually spoilers, because the trailers all told us as much about the plot. And when I saw the trailer in theaters 3 or so years ago, I laughed out loud. The premise is wondrously absurd: a perfect suburban mom suddenly attracting the attention of city police and federal authorities as she becomes a ruthless vigilante? I was bewildered by the idea, and when the title flashed on screen, I couldn't contain myself any longer.Here's the thing: The overwrought sentimentality of the flashback to her family life contrasts very sharply with the trail of blood and the frequent bursts of rock music that accompany hard-charging action scenes. 'Peppermint' doesn't work if you try to take it seriously.But if you step back and just let the movie be, without any preconceptions, a different picture emerges. Watch Riley fly through the air during a gunfight in a pinata factory. Watch her sip on a fountain drink in the car she just stole as she chases down two gangsters. There's so many more fantastic small moments I don't want to list because doing so would cut down on the fun of the first time watching.'Peppermint' isn't just an action movie. It's a B-movie. Jennifer Garner is here to kick butt and have a great time doing it, but without betraying that she's having fun.The movie moves fast, the intense action almost never stopping. The performances are fine, but with everything happening as quickly as it does, there's not a lot of room for subtlety. Only Garner is allowed a few sparing moments of nuance in between long runs of deadpan delivery, and John Gallagher, Jr. has a few cards up his sleeve, too. Simon Franglen's score keeps the adrenaline pumping when the rock music takes a break, and the entire film is crisp and clear so we don't miss a thing.I expected the quieter moments of emotional heft to bring the movie grinding to a halt, but instead they simply allow a few gasps of the breath we've been holding. Riley's reflections on her family are the prologue and the epilogue, and offer a pause during a scene change. They don't stop the action, they help to ensure it moves forward.When I first saw the trailer I laughed because 'Peppermint' looked utterly outrageous. I was right, of course. But it's outrageous not because of how overbearing it is, but because of the reckless abandon with which the filmmakers allowed this story to tell itself.What do you get when you give a B-movie screenplay a blockbuster production?An absolute delight, that's what.",Peppermint

The feel of this film is reminiscent of 80's and 90's action flicks and took me back to the days of Charles Bronson, the stone faced, avenging angel, of Death Wish fame.The pacing is good and the action plentiful, the only proviso being you can suspend disbelief and accept a women could take on and defeat multiple male opponents some twice her size, in hand to hand combat.If you can look past the implausible story this is an entertaining flick that's well done, if predictable fare.7/10 from me.",Peppermint
49,questl-18592,Peppermeh,4,8 July 2020,"What a wildly unremarkable movie. Yet another in a seemingly ever-growing list of John Wick inspired wannabes, this time we have Jennifer Garner as the lead character, a woman who lost everything and will do anything to get her revenge. Sound generic? Don't worry, IT IS!The biggest disappointment here is that, unlike the venerable Mr. Wick, the action in Peppermint is stunted, hidden away or just generally underwhelming. This was really disappointing to me, given Garner's history I would have hoped to see her flexing some of her experience and doing some more of the action herself rather than what we get here. Throw in the generic and predictable story and the complete and utter lack of of suitable explanation for why she is suddenly able to do the things that she does after spending her life as a domestic mother.It's not all bad, there is some fun to have here and there are moments of legitimate emotion. Perhaps it's because she was a mother, but 'Peppermint' does develop human connections with people, something we don't get much of in John Wick. It fits Mr. Wick just fine, but in this case it does wonders to help humanize Garner's character in a way that separates her from her female peers, looking at you Anna and Atomic Blonde.Unfortunately, that emotion doesn't quite hit hard enough to make up for the shortcomings and really distance Peppermint from the others. By the time the film was done I could already feel it fading and now, a week or so later, it's all but gone from my mind, a muddled cloud of... Meh. I do recall there being a fairly significant and pivotal scene early on that seriously annoyed me, but I honestly can't remember why at this point, that's how nonexistent this movie is in my mind.As for recommendations, if it's free to stream somewhere? Sure, go for it. It's not good but it makes for decent background noise. I wouldn't suggest buying this one though, it's just not worth it, there's not enough here, nothing of significance, no exceptional performance, scene or moment that justifies the overwhelming mediocrity.",Peppermint
50,robertemerald,Great revenge movie,9,14 June 2019,"The great wonder of this action thriller is the timeline, because at first you think it's all going to be over early on, then you realise the magnitude of the revenge intended. It's a far less slow burn than other revenge movies, being full of righteous heart and story surprises. The script is way above average and there are some classic lines. All hinges on Jennifer Garner's character role. It's an unforgettable performance, and great credit as well to the writers and Director. You have to be patient with the beginning of this movie as the set up is important. The premise at first seems a little far-fetched, but as the story unfolds you realise that most things are not as they seem. That has some ramifications later on, and it's well worth the wait. As a revenge movie this has come along with quite a bit of originality, as our heroine has a clear idea of what messages she wishes to impart. The full import of the dvd cover/movie poster becomes evident much later on, and if I have a criticism it is that this aspect could have been given a couple more scenes earlier on. It would have added credence to the character transformation and greatly helped if there is to be a sequel, of which I fervently hope there is. Peppermint has all you could want from an action thriller, big guns, perfectly choreographed shoot outs, magnificent explosions, tense successes and near-misses, and a gritty no-nonsense heroine you can't help but admire.",Peppermint
51,rgkarim,Is this a Sweet Action Film? Read This Review To find out,7,8 September 2018,"The action genre has many tools to its arsenal, primarily as to who will be driving the bus on the violence mobile. Directors of action movies have to have unique visions to bring excitement to their work, making sure to fit the stunts with the theme of the movie. A balance must be stricken though, because too much becomes over the top eye rolling issues, and too little it disappoints. So, today's review is to analyze and see if the latest action movie strikes that balance, or merely falls into the sea of the mundane that many films are. Let's get started, as Robbie K reviews: Movie: Peppermint (2018)Director:
 Pierre Morel
Writer:
 Chad St. John
Stars:
 Jennifer Garner, John Gallagher Jr., John Ortiz 
LIKES: Jennifer Garner: While not the best track record, the young Ms. Garner continues to impress me with her ability to play a lot of diverse roles. Finally getting back to her edgier roots, her step back into the action genre works for someone with a grudge, a focus, and a sense of justice. Throw in some pretty nifty moves with the prop guns, and you've got a decent hunter of justice to get shine, as she leads the way for feminism idols. The Special Effects: The ability to turn fake carnage into realistic sequences continues to be Hollywood's forte. Peppermint's scenes involve a number of well executed sound effects meeting well shot stunts to drop you into the chaos unfolding. As the bullets fly, the effects group manage to unleash the fury of the moment, bringing flash, bangs, and plenty of flying debris to further add edge to the scene. Not the most spectacular or original work, but give them props for their tricks of the trade. The Pace: Peppermint's pace is not bad at all, not so fast to miss stuff, but also not slow to make you slink in your seat and nod off. Like a balance between Equalizer and Taken, the movie manages to establish equilibrium between set up and fighting, giving us time to appreciate the planning, before getting lost in the action craziness. It's this balance that keeps things moving and out of the desert of boring, dry scenes that sometimes are designed for fluff. Throw in a decent run time and you've got a solid piece of entertainment. The Story: It's straight forward, it's simplistic, and it is fitting of what was presented in the trailer. Peppermint's tale is all about seeking justice for a group that did things wrong and got away with it. Along the way, we get a little character development in the group, but the story fits well in the thriller/action universe that this series brings. It will speak true to those with families, and like those famous episodes from NCIS or Taken the series, the movie will speak to those drama lovers who love the sense of justice delivered aggressively. The Action: Peppermint's action is pretty decent. It's tailored to show off the lethality of Garner's character as she brings pain and suffering through a variety of combat styles. Gunplay, close quarters combat, and a little strategic maneuvering will show the brawn and brains of the leading lady. It takes a little bit for the scenes to catch their stride, much like the Equalizer, but once the adrenaline gets infused the combat ramps up and starts to approach the speed and intensity of Taken. The part must people will enjoy, is some sweet, epic finishers that scream the justice you want for this woman, primarily in the satisfying camera work getting the full effect. Even better, they do a nice job of keeping things realistic and spreading it out through the movie. 
Dislikes: The Character Development: The story may not be the most complex, and that is okay, but something that gets me a little burned up is the potential introduction of character backstories and development and not following through. Taken and Equalizer have obtained the balance of transforming their characters as the situations change, but Peppermint's protagonist stays pretty consistent with less room to grow. Most likely due to the set up for a series, this film needed a little more time and divergence from the mission to give her a new outlook and potentially begin evolving her characters to new realms. Perhaps in the next movie if this goes well. The Other Characters: Like Taken, Peppermint lacks a serious integration of the other characters. It is an improvement, but the movie does a poor job integrating the other members involved in this sting operation, merely reducing most of them to nameless extras who do little but pout. Such potential to really design some players in the game of corrupt justice, Peppermint's group unfortunately cannot escape the anonymity of not being the protagonist. The Acting: Garner does a nice job, but I didn't like that her character could not show past one emotion post her training. The other heroes of these types of movies can adapt their personality to start showing the multiple sides to their character, but in this one... the internalization is not the most dynamic character to come into play. There are again hints, but they should have expanded more instead of focusing on the action and the series to come. The Action: I did enjoy the action, but for this guy, I like the faster, adrenaline focus that Taken brings instead of just the edged victory that this movie brought. Some of the scenes were a little stiff, or over too quickly, snuffing out just as the momentum finally built. So, while it struck a nice balance, the junkie of thrills in me was hoping for a little more intensity and speed when it came to combatting the Cartel. This is especially true when it comes to the finale, starting to meet its stride, but then drops the action with the snap of a finger and goes back to the drama. Emotionally charged and gripped with character? Yep! Exciting for me? Nope! It just needed a little more spunk to really be equivalent to the other movies in this series. 
The VERDiCT:  Overall, Peppermint meets its goal of an action drama movie with a stunning lead to take point for not only women, but justice itself. It's a straightforward movie, and it will get the action stirring for most of the audiences that go to see this show. Special effects with an edge, a fast pace, and some action in just about every scene, you'll certainly find some excitement in this 90-minute gun fest. Still, it doesn't quite reach the levels of Taken or Equalizer, rather somewhere in between in terms of action, characters, and edge. It's potentially going to be a series itself, where they will expand more on the character, but otherwise this movie is an entertaining venue worthy of the theater. However, this one can probably also be watched at home as well. Action/Drama/Thriller: 7.0
Movie Overall: 6.0",Peppermint

Garner tries her best, but her character is untethered from reality; within a few years, the suburban mom transforms into Lady Frank Castle, a supremely-skilled and armed-to-the-teeth avenging angel that only seems to slip up when humanity breaks through her steely shell; emotional vulnerability has no place in the pursuit of cold, hard justice, it seems. It's tough to tell what's riddled with more bullets over the course of the movie: criminal scum or credibility. Too dreary and rote to qualify as gruesome escapism (if you want that, watch ""Punisher: War Zone"") and too silly and disinterested in the moral conundrums to rate as sensationalist drama (if you want that, watch ""The Brave One"").30/100",Peppermint
54,nancyldraper,"Garner 8 (Great), Writing/Directing - 5 (Meh)",6,7 September 2018,"Jennifer Garner brought everything you could want from her role, unfortunately the writer and director didn't give her much of a movie. Garner 8 (Great), Writing/Directing - 5 (Meh). Garner gave us a depth between sensitivity and cold justice, proving to us once again that she is worthy of demanding action roles. The production, unfortunately, was flat and monotone, with lots of over the top situations but no substance, which lead to inevitable outcomes without any texture or meaning. It ended up with hype but no WOW. I give this film a 6 (fair) out of 10. One critic mused that it would have benefited from more women behind the camera to give it a more nuanced tone. I tend to think that a correct assessment, substituting a talented female lead for a male action hero does not make a convincing female action story. {Action}",Peppermint
55,OJT,Awful script ruins what could have been,3,28 September 2018,"A lot of good reviews here, but the trailer sells a bad script. the plot is OK, but nothing in the script holds water.
It's simply awful, and I left the theater 15 minutes before the end. Then I had fallen asleep, bored with the killing.
Garner does great with an awful script, and is the only one saving this from a 1/10.
Not a thing here is believable, and there are so many stupid shortcuts that is both laughable and annoying.
It's a C-thriller, quite similar to the worst of Charles Bronson's vigilante films, and far, far away from his best.",Peppermint
56,Terryfan,The most dangerous people are the ones with nothing to lose,8,25 December 2020,"Peppermint follows the story of Riley North (played by Jennifer Garner) whom five years ago her family was brutally murdered by a drug kingpin and after the corrupted justice system allows the killers to go free Riley begins to transform herself from a citizen To a warrior whom will stop at nothing to avenge her family.This movie shows that Jennifer Garner still got it when it comes to make action movies it proves that she was made to play Riley North as a character whom is so dangerous no one would dare pick a fight with her. Age ain't nothing but a number.The movie is full of blood and gore in this adrenaline pump action movie and the fight scenes are some of the wildest in any movie.Jennifer's performance is where the movie shines as we saw a slow transformation of her character hints to why I called my review the most dangerous people are the ones with nothing to lose.The score matches the movie along with the song ""Push Me"" by Geno Lenardo and Ash Costello which serves as the theme song for Riley North.While the movie isn't original and most of the characters do feel out of wax it does make up for it with Jennifer's performance and the action scenesOverall I give Peppermint an 8 out of 10",Peppermint
57,MR_Heraclius,I loved it,8,20 February 2020,"Not a new formula, but made with love, passion and emotion. Jennifer Garner plays wonderful and you feel the pain of her character in every scene she is in, but at the same time marvel at her badass fighting skills (that she adapted offscreen, which I like by the way... not everything has to be spelled out, spin your own story). The movie is tight, suspenseful and extremely entertaining, especially since it has a shorter running time than most movies nowadays, which is welcome and takes you back to the 80s and 90s where a movie didn't have to be 150 minutes long.",Peppermint

Harmed by criminals, system fails, system failed due to corruption, and then justice is served. Jennifer Garner is a great actress who doesn't do enough projects, but she did well with this one.

61,saptesh786,Interesting & watchable !,9,24 December 2018,"'Peppermint' is a surprisingly good movie. It is good to see 'Jennifer Garner' in action again. I saw her in action flicks like 'Daredevil' and 'Elektra'. Here she is doing two roles. Firstly caring & working woman who tells his daughter not to use obsessive word and not reply with a punch even other is irritating you. Secondly she appears like a hitman or assassin with no mercy. Many situations are become unrealistic like she hanging 3 men over a 'Giant Wheel', she escapes many times in even lot of gun fires, she has wounded by cuts in many incidents, recovering from gun shots etc. Even those weak points the movie is very interesting. One main reason is that story is going straight. There is only one flash back. Not a single moment is boring till the end. At the end there are few twists which will shock you. I like so much this movie that I saw it in a single sitting from start to finish. If you are action lovers then it is perfect for you. Must watchable.",Peppermint
62,Richie-67-485852,WHATS YOUR FLAVOR don't mess with me I can do that too,6,2 December 2020,"I heard the hoopla and decided to see for myself. The premise: I am coming to get you drives this movie and it is not a new concept. How they pull it off is what we all come to see. From Godzilla to Tarzan, Rambo to the Terminator, Cujo to killer Aliens anyone can star in a movie like this. So who gets a turn? A scorned woman and who better than to own those feelings? Do not try to make sense of someone who wakes up one day, trains in the use of hand to hand and weapons warfare and decides to get even of over a tragedy or injustice and excels in it? In real life, the killer gets killed or captured but in the movies the box office calls the shots (pun). I always wondered what it would be like to go into a gang held territory and open up with sophisticated guns and such and end all crime. My next thought sobered me up i.e. the same people you want to ""smoke"" smoke pretty well themselves and this movie doesn't give them justice but instead assigns them a clown role. In real life and in certain neighborhoods, you don't get a second chance but oh well this is a movie after all. Look for your inner ""getting even"" genes to be well fed and corruption turned on its head. Rude customer service, kept waiting on purpose, treated like a second class citizen?.... well you don't have to put up with it any longer is the fantasy: while we all suffer indignities none of us go ""off"" so this movie will do it for you. Look, I get it. Every once in a while we need a good shoot em up to let ourselves get it out already and then we go back to our rat races to run a good productive race until its time to dump again. This movie serves that purpose. BTW...firing a gun is a frightening experience even for trained combat people (cops too) and who also suffer from being on the edge constantly not to get shot themselves. It makes you wreck. In this movie, it makes you a star with a sequel. Its a chick flick don't mess with me I can do that too movie for girls. Being bad is not a means to an end but an end to be mean....Are you mean? If so, grab some popcorn & watch",Peppermint

65,rockman182,Peppermint (2018),6,14 September 2018,"Awful film title aside, I was having doubts on Jennifer Garner being an action hero. Don't even bother bring up Elektra. The film felt like it was capitalizing on these revenge sort of films that we have seen a trend of recently. I was expecting a dumb, turn off your brain film with good action. In parts, the film delivers in that aspect. As a matter of fact, this film was much better than I initially expected. Its not anything amazing, and the second half drags but it was a decent time at the cinema.The film is about a woman whose husband and daughter are tragically killed one night. The husband was minimally linked to a drug theft that was supposed to happen so a hit was put out on him. After being distraught by the fact that the justice system let the murders go (also through corruption), the women goes on a revenge spree against the gang that were responsible for her tragedy. She becomes a vigilante of sorts on the run from the cops, a very violent one at that.I was proved wrong about Jennifer Garner. This was a rather uncharacteristic type of film role than we are used to seeing her in. She definitely embodies the character and is a badass. The fight scenes and blood and gore are all very fun to watch. Which is great, because that's the bare minimum you want. I do think the film tends to drag, especially when it focuses too much on the cops and the gang members. Its not a wholly consistent film but was better than I expected.Its not going to be something that you'll remember much in years or give much after thought to in a weeks time, but its good popcorn filler entertainment and that's what it needed to be. It needed a more clear and focused plot and more focus on the action set pieces but for what you get its not bad at all. Garner is good in it and this could be the re-invigoration that her career needed.6.5/10",Peppermint
66,phanthinga,What your favorite ice cream flavor ?,8,25 November 2018,Peppermint is one of the better vigilante flick I've seen in 2018 next to the Death Wish remake from Eli Roth and although it directed by Pierre Morel it still very formulaic with no replay value whatsoever but even so with a short runtime and nothing hold back the action you can sit back and watch Peppermint with a bag of popcorn and not feel guilty about it the next day.For me the movie need a training montage and some alone execution for some certain character tho,Peppermint
67,jon.h.ochiai,"Revenge is Meaningless in ""Peppermint""",7,11 September 2018,"In ""Peppermint' convincingly sinuous and sullen Jennifer Garner as vengeful Mother Riley North exacts vengeance upon the corrupt Judge, who freed her family's murders. Although justified, Riley callously tortures Judge Stevens, played by sniveling Jeff Harlan, in unspeakable ways. The Hero becomes what she despises most: cruel and merciless. However, that tragic irony seems lost on Riley along with Director Pierre Morel (""Taken"") and Writer Chad St. John. Jennifer is amazing as the hero nihilist Riley, enrolling our compassion. Yet, when she's stripped of her humanity immersed in rage murdering money launderers and evil drug cartel members, she transforms as the cold-blooded murder she so vehemently despises. Being on the lighter side of justice alone, doesn't make her the force for good. She has no forgiveness, no compassion. That's the big missing in Pierre and Chad's often formulaic and predictable ""Peppermint"". Jennifer Garner is the movie's lone saving grace. Jennifer is heartbreaking horror as she witnesses the murder of her daughter Carly, played by innocent cute Cailey Flemming, and husband Chris, played by troubled Jeff Hephner. Drug dealer Diego Garcia orders the hit on Chris in retribution for his plotted conspiracy. Also injured in this gang style hit, Riley is hospitalized. Detectives Carmichael and Beltran, played by John Gallagher Jr. and John Ortiz, are assigned to her case. Riley soon realizes that the judge, prosecutors, and some of the police are beholding to Diego. She chooses to flee, in hopes of bringing those responsible to justice.""Peppermint"" open 5 years later after Riley's return to Los Angeles. She kills one her family's murderers with effective skills. In Chad's narrative, Riley mastered muay thai kickboxing and other martial arts over the last 5 years. She's also the expert in automatic weaponry. She's back to make those responsible pay with their lives. Jennifer's Riley is tragically strong and broken. She lives out of a van in LA's Skid row while she wages her war of vengeance. Riley is so very sad, having nothing to live for. She's consumed with rage, no love within. At the narrative arc, Riley tells Diego, ""I want justice."" She demands her revenge. Even if she has her revenge, then what? There is no peace in her chosen path. In Riley's suffering, Jennifer salvages ""Peppermint"". We get that Riley never healed herself. Near the end she says, ""I want it all to end."" That is so authentically sad. Riley would rather die; than live than live without those she loved. Jennifer humanizes Riley in spite of its predictable storyline. We know her pain. We pull for her to heal and find a new life. The martial arts and automatic gunfire are orchestrated with style and visual effectiveness. We get some satisfaction in seeing Riley take out her evil adversaries. Yet, that won't bring her family back. Pierre and Chad could have created a greater sense of redemption and forgiveness in the narrative resolution. What they resolve occurs as convenient throw away. I think Riley deserved better. In a sense so did we.",Peppermint

69,AngelHonesty,Defiantly not Alias,5,16 January 2021,"I am a big fan of Jennifer Garner's acting, she has tremendous talent and she does not fail to deliver in the film. Unfortunately the movie itself is poorly written giving a movie that is missing key aliments. It felt like they were trying to do a mix between Rambo and John Wick. Unfortunately with how the script was written you get a choppy story. You have sweet motherly Jennifer, then suddenly well trained Jennifer, then hardcore killer Rambo Jennifer. They left out the transitioning aliments of the movie. Or more so they should have just started with Rambo Jennifer and had her explain her past or something. They did no explain how she became this hardcore killer or have the abilities that she possess. Further more there are very few talking scenes in the movie, you don't get to know any of the character's very well which leaves you not really rooting for anyone. At least with Rambo you felt bad for how poorly they treated him for being a vet in the war. You didn't need to know all of Rambo's back story and yet you still felt for the guy and cheered him on to kill everyone. The movie Peppermint felt really off balance with having Jennifer be this sweet kind mother to suddenly being this crazy high skilled cold blooded killer in the span of five minutes. It would have made somewhat sense if she would have been ex military or CIA or something. If you want to watch Peppermint, take it for face value, an action film, nothing else. Woman Rambo killing bad people.",Peppermint
70,pietclausen,So So,6,21 November 2018,"Vigilante movies are usually entertaining and this one just makes it. The story was nice but the acting was mostly below par.

72,lojitsu,"We know everything, but we can't prove anything.",7,15 October 2018,"Here's The Lowedown on ""Peppermint"" (R - Theatrical - US)
Genre: Action/OMA (One woMan Army)Or: ""Jennifer Garner's back in the action genre? giggle""
When I heard that Jennifer Garner was doing another action movie, I was really excited. I just couldn't bear watching her in those foo foo movies. It's like watching Shaq do an insurance commercial...oh wait. The trailers looked straight forward and I got what I wanted out of the film. So while I wait and hope let's break this movie up like Elektra and get the Lowedown on this film.
Cast=6
Aside from Jennifer Garner and John Ortiz, I did not really recognize anyone else by name. There were a couple I have seen before, but did not remember their names. I cannot go higher than six points because of this. I know it's not a good way to start off, but maybe it'll make up for it in violence
Acting=7
I think Jen is a solid actress...she can ugly cry with the best of them. Her eyes can always show fear and anger unlike other actresses (yes I'm thinking about the glazed look of Kristen Stewart). There were some performances that were meh, but all in all a solid effort. Seven points for Hufflepuff!
Plot=8
Five years after her husband and daughter are killed in a senseless act of violence, a woman comes back from self-imposed exile to seek revenge against those responsible and the system that let them go free. It's a simple and seemingly overused plot...only I don't see this very often with a female lead. It could be this was not written for Jen but I'm glad she was in it...eight points!
Ending=7
This is where everything comes to a head...the huge battle and the twist...The lead gets the job done and closure is achieved. Well you get that, but no fringe benefits...it was like expecting your burger to be stuffed with cheese but it was just a burger. It still tasted good, so I'll throw them a seven.
Story=6
The story was rushed a bit...a little too much character development and not enough transformation. It was like she went from ""oh phooey, I burned the darn muffins"" to one scene with the sailors running out...what up with that? Oh well...six points for the holes in the story.Favorite Quote: ""We know everything, but we cannot prove anything.""
Genre: Action
Violent=9
Jen has not lost her touch in the violence department. I believed it and it was well done...except for a small hitch in the gunplay. I consider these as comic book movies as a 'four color universe' (meaning the Hollywood guns and the violation of the laws of physics need not apply to the score), so I did not ding them too much. Nine points for this action movie.
Pace=7
I have said this a hundred times...pace is really important with an action movie. There were some minor pace issues in the beginning due to the overused character development. I therefore score this movie with a good but not great seven points. It's respectable, but could have been better.
F/X=8
Yes, with an action movie I want good F/X...who wouldn't. Unlike Sci-Fi or Fantasy, I do not want a whole lot of CGI. I understand it in some cases, but you shouldn't need it too much in a straight up action flick. The stunts were well done but not perfect...so Peppermint gets eight points.Sub-Genre: OMA (One Man Army)
The sub-genre of the OMA or One Man Army is a new one to review. After movies like John Wick, The Equalizer, and Jack Reacher there has been a need for a new type of action movie. With that, there are some new aspects to score...things that I want out of a one man, or in this case one woman army.
Villain=7
When watching a one man army movie...I want a crapload of minion that are no threat. However, the main villain must be a danger to the protagonist...like I would be worried about the OMA having to face that guy after going through all the grunts. 
Buildup=8
Another thing I want in an OMA movie is the buildup. Start off small and make me worry about the lead...then get to where I think there is nothing she can't do...culminating with a big action scene at the end that again makes me worry again that she might not win. I got want I wanted out of it, so I'll add eight points to the score.
Total Score: 7.3
If you are looking for an Oscar winning performance, then you really have no business going to see this movie. If you are looking for a straight up no frills action flick...this is a good watch. Could you wait for the video release? Sure you can...I think it would play fine on the small screen. It's no John Wick after all...but a solid effort to bring Jen back into the genre.",Peppermint
73,bshaef,"An Excellent, Though Unbeliveable, Story, Great Acting",8,7 December 2020,And well paced action. What more could I ask for. Jennifer has some great guns and is entertaining to watch.

74,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,14 January 2019,"The stage curtains open ...At 46 years of age, Jennifer Garner still has it. As the vigilante, Riley North, she takes on a crooked cop, a crooked justice system, and a powerful drug lord when her family is gunned down right before her eyes. Riley disappears for five years, but reappears with a deadly vengeance, systematically eliminating everyone who was involved. She shows no mercy and no quarter. She wants justice and is willing to do whatever it takes to get it.In the FAQ's for this movie, someone asked if this was like ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" with Geena Davis. I will repeat my answer here. On the surface, I can see where someone might think so. But to me, this movie was more of ""Death Wish"" meets ""The Punisher"" with a little ""Alias"" thrown in. It was a vigilante film. There are no secret agents, no special training, no government operations. Just plain old fashioned revenge. And on this count, ""Peppermint"" delivers.It felt like I was viewing an action film straight out of the 90's when Seagal and Van Damme were at the height of their careers. In fact, even the film's villain, Diego Garcia (played by Juan Pablo Raba) reminded me so much of the bad guy in Steven Seagal's ""Out For Justice"", Richie Madano (played by William Forsythe). He had the same mustache, the same hair, the same sneer, the same nasty disposition. It screamed early 90's action fare.I really had a fun time watching this movie and would recommend it for action fans without any hesitation. ""Peppermint"" packs a hard punch.",Peppermint

I have no idea what film they were watching, but Peppermint deserves so much more than that.Ok so it doesn't redefine the genre and is a tad derivative in a few aspects, but it's a very fun film to watch. It is well paced, has lots of great action, and then there's the central performance from Garner which is fantastic.She is a veritable badass in this film! She was fully believable as the loving mother, then the grieving mother, and then the kickass vigilante. I completely bought into her transformation and the emotional journey that she took us on. She fully sold the role and was a great protagonist to root for.All of the action was pretty nifty and always fun to watch. I would have liked to have seen a little more hand to hand combat. When we did get some it was gritty, gory, brutal and great to watch, so more of that would have been nice. But on the whole the action elements were brilliant.The plot in these sorts of movies is always kicked to the kerb a little, and this is no exception with Peppermint, but what we did get was good. There's a good emotional set up and a few side plots and twists which were a nice addition.Sure this movie may not live up to others in the 'one person crusade' genre, films like John Wick, Taken, or Nobody, but it's by no means a dud. A very worthwhile watch which deserves a lot more praise!",Peppermint

The detectives handling the case are hesitant to pursue charges against the three, as they are members of Garcia's drug cartel, which wields considerable influence. then judge didn't put those drug cartel's in prison at all justice didn't work you know what happened after that she becomes a vigilante like punisher after five years she kills every single criminal's in town and cartels like she hanged them upside down like if it's Predator did that. this is full on action she goes around killing gangs like punisher short of thing a lot of brutal violence and action in it she goes after one by one killing that's what action films are made if it's no story, nothing like that it's called film this is no gone girl or girl in the train short of thing with story goes for 2 hours long it's called ACTION film people are just getting it wrong. If you think you love of these family wiped out vigilante movies with JCVD or seagal whoever well think again. a story of revenge that carries the same energy as John Wick and Punisher Like most movies centered around the premise of revenge, the set up is important. this is mixed style of Punisher more then Death Wish, Taken. ending leaves it like there's sequel but maybe it won't because budget didn't do much or because of bad, bad flophouse movie. i thought this movie would have been a direct to DVD film but it's not a direct to DVD film at all massive budget film Never listen to critics judge for yourself you will not be disappointed. running hours is 1h 41minutes and it's hard R RATED KICKING ASS MOVIE..",Peppermint

86,stevenrotherforth,Young mum becomes John Wick in five years?!,6,5 March 2019,"PeppermintJennifer Garner's performance is completely convincing in this neatly paced action thriller.
What isn't so convincing is the films premise.
An everyday mother loses her husband and child in a drive by shooting.
After five years living off the grid Garner's character returns as a expertly trained super assassin dispatching her wrong doers left right and centre in the style of John Wick.
Five years?
Come on script writers!
Give us something to believe in.
Maybe if Riley North (Garner) had disappeared for ten to fifteen years and we could have seen her being trained then her level of expertise in the art of violence would have been more easy to digest.
How? How did North become the bad ass she is in such a short length of time?
These questions are never answered or even addressed.
The audience are just supposed to accept that she has become a female version of John Rambo in the space of sixty months.Peppermint is entertaining and if we put the movies major flaw to one side it's a film that can be enjoyed.
Sure there's more holes in the plot than those found in a packet of a certain brand of mints.
However you can't deny that Garner is more proficient than many of her male peers when it comes down to the arse kickery.This isn't a badly directed movie either. Shaky cam and low lighting are used to disguise the physical limitations of the cast when it comes to the hand to hand combat stuff but it isn't nearly as bad as movies such as Mile 22 or any of the Taken films.
Violence is displayed unashamedly too.
Limbs are shot off and blood spurts in many a scene.
Peppermint looks and sounds as a action movie should.
With a run time of 1hr 41 mins Pierre Morel's film moves along at a exciting pace and never allows the audience to become bored.
A film that doesn't fatigue the audience by being overly long.
It's just a shame that our heroine wasn't more convincingly developed so we could actually believe in her.
Peppermint may have a throw away title.
One that has no real relevance to the actual movies plot but that's just it. Peppermint is a throwaway movie.
One that I enjoyed but probably won't remember in a weeks time.",Peppermint
87,Mike_Devine,Garner goes gangbusters,4,4 March 2019,"It seems like the shoot 'em up assassin genre has more of less hit a dry spell, even when factoring in those strong female leads who have stepped into the role over the years (Jolie, Beckinsale, Thurman, Theron and more). Jennifer Garner tries her hand in 'Peppermint,' but it's a performance most will forget (or never know in the first place).The problems with 'Peppermint' don't begin or end with Garner, though. Everything about the film feels like an early Netflix original movie (underscore ""early""). From the tragic events of the first few minutes to the choppy transitions between scenes and the comical dialogue. Sure, there is plenty of pain to go around (most of which is inflicted on the dozens of cartel members who cross paths), but it's really a stretch to see how far Garner's Riley North evolves during the course of the film. There's also a good deal of predictability to go around, as well, including the supposed twist. Despite some occasional laughs thrown in, they seem almost jarring in the context of the gruesomeness that's going on around her.If you're in the mood to see Garner bust up some baddies, 'Peppermint' is definitely worth a watch. If not, don't bother.",Peppermint

89,thebricks,Critics absolutely wrong about this movie,10,22 September 2018,"Eleven percent on Rotten Tomatoes? That's baloney. This was an excellent movie. Yes, it was kind of a ripoff of the Punisher, and the beginning is a bit silly, but after Riley North loses her mind, the movie comes into its own. Where other movies like Atomic Blonde totally fail in convincing the audience that the lead can take on armies of men, Peppermint does it in such a way that is believable and unpretentious.I can only conclude there was some sort of political hit job against this movie. Unfortunately, it's impossible to deny who is in charge of the drug gangs. Riley North was not fighting Mexicans in general, she was going after the people responsible for killing her husband and child. And the movie does go out of its way to show white people who are corrupt and evil, so it's not a racist movie.I would love to see a franchise of this series, but it will probably end up the way of Dredd looking at the box office. Hopefully, Peppermint gets a chance at a sequel if more people give it a chance on home video.",Peppermint

93,kaptenvideo-89875,Jennifer Garner comes to hurt the bad boys,6,14 October 2018,"In action cinema, there's something immensely satisfying about revenge stories (which we have seen a lot recently).Revenge makes watching killing more meaningful. Every faceless evil henchman, every crunched bone, and bullet-scattered body is suddenly just a bit more personal, because we all know what it feels to have been done wrong and scream for justice.Jennifer Garner must seem like an unexpected choice for tough action star ready to kick ass and shoot people in the face, for she's been mostly known for good looks, (co-)starring in mainstream comedies and dramas, and being married to Ben Affleck, of course.But once upon a time, she starred in hit action series ""Alias"" (2001-2006), so it would make total sense to try and recapture some of that glory.After all, revenge thrillers are a thing now, female action stars too, and Garner still in need of a that one hit that would make her a household name in Hollywood.I am not sure that ""Peppermint"" turns out to be her saving grace - critics' reactions have been rather scathing - but the movie's alright.She still looks good, all this rampage suitably adrenaline-filled, and at 102 minutes it's mercifully short so you will probably not get bored.Why even think of getting bored? The story is weak, not to mention that we've seen this kind of thing many times before anyway.Some of the key plot points are never given a half-solid explanation, such as how did the woman turn into such an effective killing-machine, and how no form of punishment is able to physically stop her. Even getting knifed in the ribs...Of course, one should probably not expect much realism from Pierre Morel, the director of ""Taken"" - the 2008 hit that helped kickstart the current trend of bloody revenge movies.Still, more fleshed-out story would add some cinematic meat to the bone, and make us relate more to characters and their world.Maybe I am too choosy but in current form, the quality of content reminds of something straight outta (surprisingly bloody) teen TV series, not a hopeful start to the new action franchise.There are action-filled revenge movies flourishing despite being made mostly of cliches, 2016's ""In a Valley of Violence"" springing to mind, but ""Peppermint"" is not among the lucky few.Shallowness aside, the result looks awesome in general. Everything looks super film-y and, in this context, just right - from the dark atmosphere to countless badasses ready to take their well-earned bullet.It's an action lovers' delight, just like your grandmother used to make - supposing she was known for modern action movies, of course.Despite the lightweight approach to storytelling, it feels like a pretty solid addition to ever-growing revenge action genre.It's not original but satisfies where it counts - always looks cool and knows how to party (i.e, showing bloodletting in visually exciting ways).",Peppermint

99,itsbobr,Good Revenge Movie,7,13 December 2018,"Five years after her husband and daughter were killed by drug dealers, Riley North (Jennifer Garner) a former bank employee seeks revenge. When a drive-by killed her husband and daughter at that amusement park to celebrate her daughter's birthday, she gave good descriptions of the killers, but a corrupt judicial system set them free. Then Riley disappeared for 5-years.What caused all this? Chris North (Jeff Hephner), Riley's husband, turned down a job on Diego Garcia's (Juan Pablo Raba) crew as a driver and Diego decides to kill him to set an example to others who turn him down.Where was Riley for those 5-years? A lot of places all over the world and in one place she engages in Fight Club Events. Now she is ready to take care of business. The FBI know what she has become and they try to pinpoint where she is now that she is back. They want to lock her up.This may remind you of Death Wish, but in here Riley is focused on just getting rid of a corrupt judge, and all drug dealers and especially the head guy, Diego Garcia. When captured near the end of the movie, she tells Diego Garcia that she will shoot him in his face.Notables: John Gallagher Jr as Det Carmichael, who tries to help Riley adjust to her new life after the deaths of her husband and daughter; Annie Ilonzeh as FBI Agent Lisa Inman, who figures out where Riley is living; Cailey Fleming as Carly, Riley's daughter; John Ortiz as Det Moises Beltran, who near the end, gives Riley a helping hand; Pell James as Peg, rich neighbor that Riley doesn't like and tells Peg that she will burn her house down with her in it.The police, FBI and Diego Garcia and his henchmen are all after Riley, but the local people all love this Vigilante and do all they can to protect her.We get to see Riley work often and the shootings and fighting stunts are very well done. Riley is as good as the characters played by Liam Neeson, Matt Damon, Denzel Washington, Mel Gibson to name a few.There is a twist in here and it surprised me. Oh, the title: Peppermint. That was the flavor of ice-cream Carly wanted on her birthday at the amusement park.One more thing: Riley made good on that threat to Diego Garcia. And another thing: Sequels wanted.

107,blrnani,Sydney Bristow is back!,8,13 January 2019,"Or at least Jennifer Garner's mojo :o)
This is a perfect role for her, as it starts off by showing the family side, a good mother and wife, with a well-meaning husband and delightful daughter.
However, we're already starting to wonder where this fits in with her life and death struggle in a car during the opening credits and suspect it might have something to do with the get rich quick scheme proposed by a friend of the husband - which he rejected because his family were too important to risk.
It didn't make any difference though, because the 'friend' had already been found out and tortured by the local cartel leader, who ordered Chris' family to be eliminated 'as a lesson to others'.
The father tries to protect his daughter, but they are both raked by a hail of fire. Riley had gone back to get napkins, as daughter Carly was eating peppermint icecream, so she is hit from further away, and survives. And she was close enough to remember the killers' faces.
Up to now this is just another moving human tragedy. What turns it into something more is what happens next. The police find the killers and she identifies them. The mobster tries to pay her off, but she refuses and it goes to trial. But the judge and lawyers on both sides of the aisle are in the pay of the cartel and the case is dropped. Worse, when Riley erupts at the injustice of it all, she is tazered and sent for internment in a mental institution. She escapes from the ambulance and disappears.
Only to reappear years later looking for vengeance. And the audience are surely with her. The timing of this film is perfect, which is presumably why the critics are so scared of it. Of course taking the law into your own hands is fraught with moral hazard, but what do you do when you've given the system the chance to correct the error and it comes out looking decidedly broken. What we are belatedly realising today is that society is a very fragile thing that depends on the parts all working properly. Damaged parts jeopardise the workings of the entire system and need to be removed (and fixed if possible, but with some parts there doesn't seem to be any chance of fixing, or not the time and effort available to invest in that endeavour).
So this is the discussion that the film provokes. And it is most convincing because although Riley has turned herself into an efficient killing machine she has not lost her humanity in the process. The police trace her because of the plummeting crime level in that neighbourhood, since the people there - most of them homeless - have a new 'guardian angel'. And on two occasions she risks her own life because of other people's children.
It is a discussion we must have in the western world, because moral relativism is undermining our sense of right and wrong, which has been buried under piles of superfluous dogma accumulated over the decades.
On the one hand, it's a very good action movie (far superior imho to the John Wick and Jack Reacher franchises), but there's also a lot to think about in relation to this timely issue.",Peppermint

I'm overwhelmed why she did not complained about so many plot holes during production, because I'm sure they would be there in the screenplay the same way they are in the movie.The plot is not original, and we have been there with Jodie Foster and her vigilante role in a near past with The Brave (2007). Uma Thurman also came back from a coma and got justice by her own ways in Kill Bill (2003), and The Punisher did lost his entire family the same way Riley did.There's no problem about recurring plots, but there's no forgiveness for bad developed ones. And Peppermint is just a bunch of bad developed recurring plots and old ideas that never means anything in a whole.From start to finish, nothing in the movie is convincing despite Garner's acting. How did the character disappeared like magic for 5 years? How did she got trained? Who helped her? Did she learn everything by herself just watching YouTube tutorials? And, really... the ""plot twist"" (if I might call it that way), is one of the lamest things I've ever seen in recent years. I think that I was so disappointed by that ""plot twist"" as I was when I watched Along Came A Spider (2001). If in 2001 that kind of plot twist wasn't surprising anymore, what about 2018/19?I feel sorry and sad for Jennifer Garner, because she put so much energy to the character the same way she did for Elektra (2003), but again, nothing here helps her to succeed. The plot, as stated, is a mess. The direction has so many problems that words aren't enough to describe. Edition is efficient as TV movies from the 90's. The soundtrack is the worst thing I've ever heard in a movie.Feels like everything was made on purpose to be a faillure.

118,gcsman,I hope Jennifer Garner got a decent payday for this one,5,15 November 2020,"Jennifer Garner, Charlize Theron, and Milla Jovovich seem to be the flag-bearers for early-middle-age actresses doing tough action films (I'd include Angelina Jolie and Kate Beckinsale too, except that they seem to have moved on from these). Anybody can envy the shape they're in and their ability to carry movies like these. Nevertheless, they deserve better scripts and better production values than 'Peppermint' gives Garner. It's all pretty watchable, but it's just a standard revenge-killing plot carried out in a fairly standard way. Riley North (Garner) witnesses her husband and small daughter shot down on the street. She disappears for 5 years to train herself into a stone-cold killer and martial-arts expert (how exactly?? that gap is not really filled in.) Then in a sequence of a few days she launches her revenge against the drug-dealer mob who did it. She deals out a lot of violent death, getting extremely covered with bruises, dirt, and blood along the way. And with a tiny bit of help from one police officer, she succeeds in doing a fade at the end. That's it.Aside from Garner, I didn't recognize any of the other cast and probably wouldn't if I saw them again. Workmanlike acting but nothing exceptional. The bad guys including the ultimate murdering drug-lord kingpin are cardboard-cutout characters. What's a little offputting is how *dirty* everything is -- action taking place in dirty warehouses, dirty streets, grundgy police stations, homeless skid-row camps. Goes with the violent theme of the story, but I tend to like my film action a little more elegant and sunlit.",Peppermint
119,OneAnjel,The Hannie Caulder of the 21st century,10,10 January 2021,"I would definitely call myself an Action buff, so I've seen a few revenge films. There's a long list -- Straw Dogs, V for Vendetta, Count of Monte Cristo, Sleeper, Taxi Driver, Desperado, True Grit, Falling Down & Commando... Of those that deal directly with revenge over brutality or death of loved ones, the list is a bit shorter but we immediately think of Death Wish (be sure to see the original with Charles Bronson), Death Sentence (Kevin Bacon), Django Unchained, Seeking Justice, and Edge of Darkness. Still concentrating on the Action genre but looking at women in the lead role, the choices narrow -- Kill Bill (based on a little known 1973 film They Call Her One Eye), Hard Candy, The Brave One (interestingly there are more if we include foreign films), but the list is pathetically short. But there is one that really blew people away when it hit theaters in 1971 called Hannie Caulder (Raquel Welch). Despite some misguided direction and crude humor surrounding the sex-symbol star aimed at trying not to make men feel to emasculated, Hannie Caulder was the only other film that I found in my grey-matter rolodex that follows this theme: mild mannered beautiful woman with everything going for her sees her loved ones murdered, turns bababababad af and slaughters the murderes others have been unable to capture. So there you have it. An old film but worth a gander.
I loved Peppermint, and we learn at a carnival just before the killing what the title is referring to. Jennifer Garner has changed my mind about her (previously I looked at her face and thought ""geez, is Julia Roberts ever going to retire! Sorry to Garner fans!) I'm glad I didn't let that turn me off to this film. It is everything your favorite bad af male actor leaves on the floor. I thought everyone involved in the film did a great job. I found them all to be believable considering the short intro to each and their parts. This film was a ride and it has zero rest stops.
And if I can let you in on one more thing: For me, having watched it on Jan 9, 2021, this film symbolizes the fight and perseverance we'll all need after the toughest and greatest POTUS conceded to the dirty dems. We're looking at the new holocaust; the NWO has overthrown the last of the American constitution. We need to believe in ourselves now. That's how it made me feel. Thanks for reading.",Peppermint

123,perica-43151,Karma served to the filthy elite,8,17 November 2021,"This movie was panned by critics and cen nsors hate it, and the sheer quality of the film is in stark contrast to that. As always, when elite critics and not so elite cen nsors take issue with a movie, there is something going on. The movie is very well done, a revenge story about a mother going after corrupt system and some bad hombres that killed her family. It is very watchable, especially efficient is the first part, not every kill is shown. But the judge, the DA, the privileged all get their well deserved karma. The second part of the movie is more run of the mill action, but the point of fighting the corrupt system is powerfully laid out, and that was a thorn that doomed privileged elite critic fakke reviews. In the end, in the corrupt system, even the good cops, like the Latino police chief, have to go beyond system to help the likable heroine. Privileged annoying rich mother of daughter school-friend was especially cruelly portrayed, she survives but has to live with herself, a punishment worse than death, and obviously too many a cens sor/elite crittic identified with the wrong gal. This is a movie pins the ""depl lorable"" majority of the good people who are dealt rough cards in life, against the privilleged elite and cruel thuggies who, together with the corrupt critics, own the once free country, and the thing they are mostly afraid of are the people taking justice into their own hands, including some high powered guns, being necessary to the security of a free State, and a well trained one woman militia squad takes care of that. Very enjoyable movie inspiring true justice and rising of the underdog against the bloodsucker criminals of white collar, cartel and all other sorts. The country that is run by cartel of fakkers can be overtaken by the justice of the oppressed, just like the homeless can unite under the leadership of the just one.",Peppermint

It does leave a few unanswered questions though:
There was, for instance, a moment where Riley does a Batman disappear somehow.
At the time. about twelve guys and a helicopter are facing her, then the head guy looks away, and then looks back and she's gone!
Where did she go?! Is she magic? Is she a ninja? Why didn't the other 11 guys and a helicopter see her, while facing her, wander off?Why did the guy, who I think she met once for 5 minutes, if she met him at all, know her so well that he knew exactly what she'd do next?Why was the film called Peppermint? Was it because her daughter once had a peppermint ice cream? Is peppermint an ice cream flavour? Why would any kid want an ice cream that tastes the same as the toothpaste used to brush after the ice cream?Where on Earth did Riley learn to be Jason Bourne?Why did all the guys who we see kill her family end up being killed off screen, while some other people we have no connection to get action/revenge scenes dedicated to them.

The writers made you care about Garner's family and hence when they are killed and the system lets her down, you feel her anger and frustration.But then what could have been a really meaty episode of her turning herself from a cookie baking mum into a John Wick style character was completely ignored and she then returns 5 years later kicking untold ass.But the thing is, her transition to Joanne Wick hadn't been earned. As the audience, you didn't see her training, funding her way through different methods of learning and fighting all driven by an unshakeable anger. The writers could have shown us some of that or the fear/trepidation as her first kill but we got none of that.Hence when the action does start it feels a little silly before descending into full stupidity. I mean come on, Garner is like a size 8 or 10 and she's punching out the lead bad guy with no fist support or anything.It started well but completely wasted an emotional set up with cheesy action, overladen sentiment that she was some kind of modern day Robin Hood and just flat out cliched nonsense.

There's a few issues with editing, which rob the viewer of some satisfaction, but overall, it's quite a fun ride. The supporting cast is good, too, and there's an awesome twist toward the end which should surprise you-for several reasons. Is it realistic? Probably not, but it's not like other films with men in the same role(s) are realistic, either. Garner does a good job carrying the plot: You will laugh and cry and cheer her on in this one.

I get that it's a movie and so most the laws of reality don't apply, but this one just threw the entire book out of the window. I feel like I could have ignored a 45yr old 125lb woman beating down gangsters and surviving bomb blasts unharmed, but the authorities bird-dogging this lady at some NSA level is just too much to ignore.
Maybe at least she could have worn a pony tail when she was going all ninja mom?
The acting wasn't all bad. Say for the police captain who continually made sarcastic remarks I would have expected from a 12yr old.

Great storyline with superb acting from Jennifer Garner not to mention very well direct. Me and mother really enjoyed it. If you like John wicks then you will like this.

I honestly expected to hate this movie, I thought it was going to be just another Punisher rip-off, and to some degree, it may well be, but it stood as a fresh take to me.I felt like Jennifer Garner played the part really well and has a knack for being both pissed and calm at the same time. The film was shot pretty decently, there were scenes where they really thought outside the box and did things that really stood out, but then there were other times where the movie felt all too familiar.I was also pleased with some of the decisions they made with characters and how everything turned out. The film really steers the viewer into thinking something is going to happen and then flips it, was pleased to see that. Ultimately for me, I think if you would have had her die at the end it would have been a better ending, sad? Yes. However, it would have made her a martyr for the common good and you could have really played it up, but I know that that wouldn't leave it open for a sequel.I actually enjoyed the movie, but I also REALLY loved The Punisher, and will more than likely watch it again someday.",Peppermint

The main story is simple, is about how mother take revenge to kill the murderers of her family, that coming from super dangerous mafia cartel, but here the Director has living up the complex plots. The scenes are seen so real, with the good shooting locations, dramatic moments, hard languages, that all is needed to lead the continuity of each scene. Here the Editor has limited some plots, but it still looks good and audience still understands the whole point. Perhaps some movie reviews had criticized about this fiction weak part of this movie, whether this movie can happen or not in our real life, for example there are such a corrupt judge, bad police, mafia gangster, victims of injustice system, poverty, daily needs of people, and everything that perhaps seems too much, but it could happen in United States of America. Then perhaps this movie has been inspired by several movies about gangster or revenge, such as Taken, but here still as movie audience, I could get the point of critic, that people from superpower country still experience the feeling of being guilty to not take part to end the injustice. If they take part, somehow they will loose some things in their life. Jennifer Garner's acting must be appreciated here that has mother power in action. Thank you for this lovely idea to always protect our family, no matter what and how far law and order can be limited by the need of being secured.

The 'Alias' actress Garner portrays Riley North, a strong headed woman who takes revenge against a drug cartel who murdered her family. Suspenseful, it left you guessing the outcome, however there was excessive violence and most of it was unnecessary, but Peppermint did follow through with its promises as keeping you on the edge of your seat as she believed that right-overcomes-wrong.

A banker won't be able to put up with people that lived their entire life in violence after only 5 years of practice. And I think maybe the first couple of kills should have shown how hard it is to kill for a person that never was violent.
I had one idea during that movie: What if that was a ""sequel"" to Alias, Jennifer Garners badass show, and it was the same main character that aged and has a family now?Other than that, I enjoyed the movie.

husband and daughter, gunned down by a drug cartel.It's not John Wick or Bryan Mills from Taken, every thing she lived for is gone, so she doesn't care about life of criminals, only those who feel down trodden.There is that Rambo style, bold use of weapons and the self repair of open wounds which we see in all its goriness. Jennifer Garner has done a excellent job, better than some male action actors in similar situations. She brings vigour, emotion and sly humour to the character.If there was ever a follow up to this movie, it will now get noticed. The title ""Peppermint"" seems rather unfitting for a movie like this.

The female 'John Wick' as many have said.
I think it's different too, very un-womanly which sounds a bit sexist, but yes she can give as good as any male assassin.It's roller-coster action all the way!
The critics are digging far too deep when it's a simple movie achieving quick results.Corruption within the law enforcement system and the legal justice system. People wouldn't expect a normal so callled 'soccer mom' to take on broken justice! Well she did.Question did she rob the bank that she was employed at? That's what they were not sure of.
She took somebody's car at gun point but paid for it? ""Consider it a rental"" Riley said.You just got to give it to Jennifer it was a tough role and she gave it her all both action and emotional.It's one of those films that gets the public vote, it will be a movie in the ranks of Atomic Blonde, Mad Max-Fury Road, Monster and the up and coming Black Widow with Scarlett Johansson, which is thought to be R rated.
What they have in common is they're all gritty rolls, BlackWidow could be too.But again a great movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat.",Peppermint
167,ingra88,Read these reviews before placing judgement!,10,30 April 2019,"Peppermint is one hell of s good movie.
If you believe the film critics, what are they try to do to you.
Critics create a so called professional opinion, but that does not make them really professionals.
We as the public watch as many movies as they do so we can pass professions opinion, is that right?
That because the movies were made for all us 'the public' to see not just them. That's theitr self centred opinion.
Now if you read the publics critical reviews, you will
notice it is completely opposite to what the Pro crust have said, the larger majority of people have given it a 7-10 rating, only a very, very small minority have given it a 3 and below. Please see for your self also watch the public reaction to this movie on YouTube it's crazy in favour of this movie.",Peppermint

Go forward January 2020, saw Rambo Last Blood.
It felt like a similar story, person looses everyone they love. Rambo has his usual revenge.Now going back to Peppermint after a few years and still it's brilliant.
They got to get Riley North in a film with Rambo and John Wick, it will be utter carnage with a body count so high, everybody would want to watch it.",Peppermint

It, too, dramatizes the same ideas with revenge and seeking justice. The same supernatural ability in law enforcement exists, but in scenes closer to reality, e.d. widowed mother who's gained viral popularity via social media. The end is a cliff hanger, so it promises the sequel.",Peppermint

180,mxsuba26,John Wick's Sister with Tude?,1,7 December 2020,"In a nutshell: Violent and psychotic middle aged woman avenges the death of her husband and daughter by going on a massive killing spree.An absurd film with Jennifer Garner playing the nice wife whose hubby and kiddo were just gunned down by a Mexican drug lord. After the murders, Garner goes off grid for five years and transforms herself into John Wick with a vagina. She becomes a skilled MMA fighter, carjacker, knife fighter, burglar, a master of small arms and an expert with explosives. She uses these skills to waste every single bandito plus one alcoholic cop that was involved in her family's deaths. Even when shot, stabbed multiple times and slashed, old Jenny keeps on killing the baddies and punching out guys twice her weight. That is believable. If you like pure violence you will like this film.",Peppermint

At one point, when JG's ""dead daughter"" was standing by her sleeping/unconsciousness mom, I thought please don't ""ask your mom"" to wake up/get up. Well, guess what happened? That was one of many eye rolling moments during this movie.I would have liked Peppermint more if the script wasn't a carbon copy of so many movies like it before.",Peppermint

184,verminhater,Very good action / revenge thriller. Great performance from Jennifer Garner.,8,21 April 2019,"Jennifer Garner provides a very credible performance as an ex-housewife on a revenge mission. The effort Garner has put in in learning how to fight and handle guns obviously paid off as she certainly looks the part during the action sequences, of which there are many.The story itself is nothing special being a run of the mill revenge plot but it's well made and well acted and it's the believability that hauls it up to a 8/10 for me.There is the odd small plot failure - I won't go as far as plot hole as I didn't spot them on watching the film and am only aware of them via other reviews. The film was easily enough to gloss over any such small issues.All, in an excellent piece of entertainment and a credit to those who made it.",Peppermint

This movie is amazing !
Don't listen to bad reviews unless you don't like action !
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie loving every well performed brutal action sequence and yes the acting to was formidable!
The acting was so powerful in some parts of the movie I even tested up or ended up yelling even screaming at the tv ""come on Riley "" . This should have won far more awards and far more affection from critics !",Peppermint
188,Chiller7,"Garner was good, but average-quality action scenes keep Peppermint from being truly great",7,2 November 2018,"The most important part of an action movie is, of course, the action, so I'll be mainly discussing the action. Garner clearly trained for this role. She has the physicality to be believable enough as a competent vigilante. And she handles herself well enough with guns and in fight scenes. Garner herself was good, but there's just something lacking in the way the action scenes were choreographed, like they lacked style or spark, so that Peppermint's action scenes are, at best, only average in quality overall, not outstanding, which is a shame because the ingredients for a spectacular action movie like John Wick are here, but this movie just didn't quite achieve it. I'd rank Peppermint's action below the superb quality of great recent action movies like John Wick or Atomic Blonde. That's not to say the action was all bad though. An example of bad action in a recent movie I saw would be Mile 22, where the camera shakes so much and the editing is so choppy that we can barely see anything. Thankfully, Peppermint doesn't resort to that style of choppy shaky-cam action, so at least Peppermint can be praised for holding the camera relatively steady during its action. The highlight of Peppermint's action, I'd say, would be a scene where Jennifer Garner infiltrates the bad guys' heavily guarded base by creatively using an SUV for cover. That scene was pretty good.And I watched this whole movie and never learned what the title means. What does ""Peppermint"" have to do with anything in this movie?",Peppermint
189,coastdaze,Jennifer Garner is BACK!,10,11 September 2018,"Now this is the Jennifer I've been missing since her TV series, Alias. Hard hitting, take no prisoners (literally, you'll get it when you see the movie) kind of storyline. I had hoped this movie, despite it's fluffy title, would be entertaining...it was. Had me from the first scene. Don't get too down on the title, you'll get it when you see the movie.What I like about JG is that she is lanky and some might say skinny, but she can pull off a role like this easily. Her expressions are real and draw you into her character. The casting is good, too. So surrounded by a solid cast, JG and company make this a 10 for me. The theater audience clapped at the end indicating our enjoyment of a blazing guns movie. I hope to see Jennifer coming back and taking on more roles like this and the sweet girl roles, too. She's a favorite of mine.LOL, just thought of this...Jennifer Garner is so much better at playing a hard-hitting role like this than her husband(?) Ben.",Peppermint
190,Ioreka,Not good,3,13 May 2020,"This is a poor film. The action sequences mostly involve Riley shooting people in the face. The plot sees her taking on ever bigger groups of enemies.

191,jon_anderson77,Solid revenge movie,7,22 January 2020,"The revenge genre is arguably my favourite of all genres and I can safely say I've seen everything worth seeing and this sits nicely in the mid range of all those. Decent plot, brilliant performance from an under rated Garner who still seems to suffer from affleckitis all these years later. My only criticism is that the revenge elements could have been more satisfying. I was hoping for more man on fire justice but things were slightly watered down which was a shame. What was particularly good in this case is that she went after everyone involved in the crime including the failings of the court. This film needed more eyes on it on release and sadly a short time at the theatres meant it has to gain popularity thru word of mouth. For me its a 7 out of 10 using a 5 - 10 rating for movies i consider worth watching",Peppermint

A 29/100 average is just a joke.Yes this is not an original story, no it isn't realistic in any way, but that isn't really what it is about and what people want from a movie like this.It is a classic revenge story, where both her daughter and husband murdered. Giving her every incetament to go all in and not give a f..k.The movie actually delivers when it comes to feeling the right things at the right moment and Garner does a great job as the lead.

200,nightwishouge,Abandons no cliche,4,13 September 2018,"I'm guessing Peppermint was pitched as ""a female Punisher"". On paper, that's intriguing. Unfortunately the project never really developed beyond that.I think director Pierre Morel thought he was making a legitimately important film rather than a mindless potboiler. The movie wastes too much time on by-the-numbers formula, as though it has pretensions of being a gritty character piece. This isn't inherently a bad thing--Tarantino, for example, is a master of fleshing out familiar story lines and making them dynamic and exciting. Peppermint, however, brings nothing new to the table. The screenplay is so derivative you'll be calling out certain lines of dialogue before the characters even say them. Peppermint has potential, but it should have been more streamlined and stylized, a la John Wick.Jennifer Garner is also miscast. She's a good action heroine, but the story calls for her to be haunted and tormented--a woman with nothing left to lose. Garner can get a sad look on her face, but the darkness never seems to shade her soul. She's just too adorable for such a part, maybe.There are a few good action sequences that make Peppermint a worthwhile theatrical experience if you have Moviepass, which is the only reason I saw it. Otherwise, wait for it to show up on streaming outlets.",Peppermint

208,MackMonMay87,Garner is good. The rest....?,6,8 December 2020,"Peppermint is a female-led version of The Punisher, or really any generic revenge flick out there. I'm fine with this, because really, there's only so many revenge plots you can make a movie of that can appeal to a wide audience, s far as I know at least. John Wick uses a basic and plain plot also, so did Taken, from the same director as this movie, and both of those were executed with style and an identity of their own.I saw Peppermint on streaming, and it feels made for streaming. The budget and over all quality is better than Bruce Willis' recent direct to streaming garbage, sure, but the movie overall feels fairly plain and relatively small in comparison to other action genre hits.Easily the best part about this movie is Jennifer Garner. Who still looks amazing, kicks ass, and delivers what she can with the script she's given. Her and the one good cop in the movie are the film's best actors.Everything else in this movie is fairly standard, but not great. The cartel gangsters in the movie are written to be incompetent pushovers who make dumb choices that make them easy targets. Jennifer Garner' s character never has help from any other character; John Wick gets his life saved multiple times in his franchise.
When will filmmakers learn that while having a female action lead is compelling due to her disadvantage strength-wise, that doesn't mean you should never show them being vulnerable or needing help? Iron Man, Spider-Man, Batman, John Wick, Rambo, and more, have gotten plenty of help from other characters. It's not as obnoxious and on-the-nose as other female led action films, but the former Soccer Mom Garner plays here is more or less a one woman army who only gets superficial wounds and never has even one moment where she needs back up. Charlize Theron was fairly invincible in Atomic Blonde, but that movie was dripping with style, identity, and intriguing visuals and a heightened, almost comic book take on its world that made it stand out.Peppermint looks more down to Earth visually, which gets jarring when its characters act in silly, over the top ways, or a woman Garner's size can string up 3 grown men on a ferris wheel single handedly.
The action and choreography is pretty well-handled for the most part, if a little straightforward and simple at times, but Garner's weapon handling looks convincing. I was also a huge fan of the fact that while her character is trained in some hand to hand, there were no scenes of her using her legs to toss a 250lb man head over heels. Man, that's gotten worn out. Her only hand to hand moves stun the badguys until she can finish them off more plausibly with a weapon.The major gripe I have is that The Punisher, John Wick, and Liam Neeson in Taken are all killers before the events of the story. It's hard to believe soccer mom Riley North becoming a killing machine in her late 30s, even with $50,000 in stolen cash and all the time she needs. It's more in the psychological aspect and the lack of formal training you would get doing everything ""off the grid"" (because it's just that easy to avoid the LAPD and FBI). She moves in the gunfights like a trained special forces operator who's seen numerous tours of duty. It would make more sense if she just became an actual mercenary as a career, and then did this revenge quest as a side job. You wouldn't get the skills she has underground style.Anyways, if you're bored during lockdown like I was and need a time killer and like these sort of movies, like Garner, and have already seen the better renditions of this sort of thing, Peppermint is relatively fresh.",Peppermint

Jennifer Gardener going around with automatic weapons killing the bad guys who are responsible for killing her family has great entertainment value imho.

212,jaapeelman,Reasonable revenge-movie,7,23 September 2018,"Not a bad movie and you can feel the pain of the mother, played by J. Garner, and feel her frustration as the justice-system does not help her.
There are some flaws in this movie as f.i. that she can identify all three gunmen, sitting in a moving dark car from a not so small distance. And when she faces the drugslord he is able to stab her three times with a knife but than he runs away instead of stabbing her in the head (and than end of story). Also she is some kind of Rambo and it is unclear how she can achieve evrything she does.
But if you put this all aside it is an entertaining but violent movie which is not bad and not good and therefore I rate it as a seven. If you are going to watch it: it is just a violent movie about revenge with some (big) flaws.",Peppermint

Peppermint starts out good, but when the tragedy happens, it doesn't take long until we fast forward to the present and Garner is this super vigilante able to take on any criminal. And that would have been great... if we actually got to see how she got like that? They play around with the thought that it's unlikely that she would go from soccer mom to this crime fighting anti-hero, but it doesn't go any further. Somehow she got that way and we just have to accept it. No real storytelling, and it leaves me dissatisfied as I feel I dont know her at all, and we never really got to see her really emotionally suffer from the incident.It's packed with great action, but the villains are sadly too stereotypical that it gets boring and predictable, and the connection they have to the incident is not strongly written either.All in all - an ok action thriller, but hoped for, and expected a better film.",Peppermint

219,ryanbartlett-870-746486,A movie just as predictable as any summary you can find,4,15 September 2018,"You can even lengthen it to add some motivations to Jennifer Garner, but at the end this movie should be title ""Jennifer Garner kills people."" That is really all that happens in the movie and if you are into that then you will have a good time. If not, this is not the movie for you.
 Garner's acting career can be summarized as the nice, perfect mom. I don't know if it was her idea or the director of the movie, but it was way out of character. And I think in the future she is going to stay in her bubble. Peppermint has as much depth as the title has relating to the movie. Being the only time peppermint is mentioned in the movie is its the ice cream flavor that her daughter got for the first time ever the day she was killed. Never mentioned again. This is how the plot also goes, they talk here and there but there is nothing that you could miss or hear that really means anything. All you need to know is Jennifer is going to kill people.
 To one degree you could say it was for revenge or justice, but when she kills her killers right off the back, you know she just wants to kill everyone. To the average eye this movie could be very entertaining. But look past the murderous façade and you will see that there is almost nothing. Garner needs to stay in her lane, and if she strays from it, at least get a good writer to make a movie she can actually thrive in.

The ""Trust No one"" twist with good acting, photography, script and directing, this thriller holds you to the end in order to find out what happens to our hero.

225,ActionFan-Reviews,Peppermint: Revenge Tastes Sweet,7,25 September 2018,"Peppermint is definitely one of the better action movies I've seen in 2018. It was a solid action packed, tale of revenge that was pretty entertaining and thrilling. Jennifer Garner was great, she was a perfect fit for the role. I couldn't see too many actresses do a movie like this, but she is great emotionally portraying a mother who has just lost her family and physically in the action heavy scenes as she performed most of her own stunts and kicks plenty of ass. 
The story may not be the most original, but anyone can relate to a movie about revenge as the theme is universal. It is fast paced, action packed, violent and worth a watch if you enjoyed movies like John Wick, Equalizer and other similar R-rated action titles. Overall, better than the similar plotted Death Wish remake that came out in early 2018. Ignore the mainstream critics, they generally hate these kinds of movies anyway. It is much better than what Rotten Tomatoes says.7/10",Peppermint
226,pckq,Cringy PUNISHER rip-off....,2,7 January 2019,"Peppermint is a blatant rip-off of Marvel Comics 'The Punisher'. Vigilante, this time a Mrs. Punisher goes on a rampage and takes out the mexican mob solo style.While the actions scenes were mostly ok, the acting at times is so bad it will make you laugh. The script seems to have been put together by a ten year old, and the direction is typical B-Movie/TV stuff. Not worth the 100+ Minutes this lame flick runs for.",Peppermint
227,LordofArt,A magnificent cinematic rollercoaster,8,6 February 2019,"Peppermint, an action movie that doesnt disappoint. At some point I felt she was the female version of Denzel Washington's character in ""The Equalizer"". I loved the fact that the revenge was served cold. For Chrissakes, the husband didn't even steal from the drug lord. What he would have done was beat him and let him go at least but he decided to take everything that could ever make her (Riley North) happy. The drug Lord broke the 19th law of the 48 Laws of power.",Peppermint
228,zterrell,Sharpshooter would be better,4,12 December 2018,"Much like her tv series 'Alias', Jen takes a beating and goes on ticking... and ticking... and ticking. Hollywood has been trying to make women into men for the last 30 years, but even men don't handle a beating like her -- with the exception of Tom Cruise.
Why not make a movie like Shooter, when your lead is a woman? Why can't she use her brain instead of her brawn?
I wanted to like this Death Wish remake, but you didn't see Charles Bronson going fisticuffs every two or three minutes.
Maybe it's just me and my wife, but it would be nice to see a smart woman using her brain to outwit the dimwitted bad guys.

238,paintedlaughter-56290,Garner made this movie a 7.,7,17 March 2019,"I expected to love this movie after reading some reviews. And Garner was impressive overall. I haven't seen her choose anything worthy of her talents over the last 12 years until now. But the storyline and script left something to be desired. It would have been beneficial if the film had delved further into character development and explained how a sweet, young, grieving mom became a vicious, well-trained vigilante. And the cop dialogue was not just clichéd, but terribly acted at times (truly cringe worthy).Some of the moments that would have been the most meaningful (or personal) to the audience to watch in terms of retribution were denied anything more than a brief summary. The screenwriter made an error by not capitalizing on the empathetic pain the audience experiences in the beginning, and instead disconnected from that and created a cold, emotionless kill-fest flick. Certain things didn't make sense in the storyline too (I won't go into detail) which is always frustrating because it seems to insult the audience's intelligence.Overall, super violent, tons of action, but still not up to my standards for Garner after getting hooked on Alias all those years ago. That said, I think this was a step in the right direction for her.",Peppermint
239,ddrddr,overly long 1hour and 41 minutes of nonsense,2,7 March 2019,"This is a strictly by the numbers seen it all before action movie
All they have done here is substitute Steven Segal for Jennifer Garner.
This is a slick move for the producers as all of a sudden people are giving this rubbish high praise.
To be fair Jennifer Garner is very good and works her little cotton socks off.
Its just a pity that an actor with her skills is relegated to making garbage like Peppermint, sadly at her age she is no longer the hot young leading lady, it is a shame that anti ageism is not as popular as alleged sexism.
Anyway, apart from Miss Garner this film sucks.
We have seen it all before, it is a revenge movie where all of a sudden without any real explanation our lead character becomes a super assassin who is virtually indestructible, no matter how many times they get stabbed beaten or shot.
This movie is a very poor copy of the vastly superior ""the Long Kiss Goodnight"" and that came out in 1996!
The script is a complete farce, nothing is ever explained and the whole film is one big plot hole.
I guess a lot of people like action movies, they like to put their brains into neutral and sit back and watch gratuitous violence I suppose it is slightly more entertaining than watching paint dry, but only just.
It is an overly long 1hour and 41 minutes of nonsense",Peppermint
240,mingsphinx,You root for her,7,3 March 2019,"Vigilante kills bad guys with a girly mothering twist. Slathering the estrogen thickly throughout the film actually helped it along and made it work. Unlike other female action movies, Peppermint does not try to 'make a man' out of the protagonist. She remains a woman throughout the show and feminine references like using a sanitary pad as a bandage is depicted coolly as unsentimental pragmatism.Despite the many times over the top action sequences where the hero has an inhuman ability to withstand pain and still be a functional killer even though she has leaked buckets of blood, this revenge flick works because the motive for the violence that follows is properly explained and we can understand where she is coming from.",Peppermint
241,TYContact1,"Gritty shoot-them-up without the iconic lines in John Wick and Taken, slick characters in District B13, and remarkable scenes in Atomic Blonde",7,7 September 2018,"The latest entry from Pierre Morel is a serviceable late summer actioner. At 1:45 running time, the simple story could have saved 10-15 minutes by cutting down the convoluted conspiracies and corrupt systems that Garner's character struggled with. Working with a modest budget, it should just aim to be a satisfying vengeance movie.The formula in Taken worked, because there is time pressure on Mills to find his kidnapped daughter within 48 hours. In Peppermint, there isn't really a sense of urgency nor crisis for North. As a revenge flick, John Wick exacts his vengeance against a relentless horde of gangsters convincingly, and with dark humour, thanks to stylish pulp-fiction like dialogues, Chad Stahelski's exquisite fight choreography and Elisabet Ronaldsdottir's crisp editing that keeps audience focused and intrigued. Action scenes are pointless if audience does not feel invested and can follow the camera (for example, the hecticly filmed Mile 22).The political conspiracies were convincing in Atomic Blonde, because the actors and writers successfully kept tension and suspense.I hope (if there is) Peppermint Part 2 will invest more into dialogues and memorable set pieces, because this (possible) franchise needs to impress movie-goers and TV-viewers who have seen too much in the vigilante genre (besides novel / comic based) in recent years.",Peppermint

253,pinemaples,"Come for the action, stay for the revenge.",7,16 September 2018,"In much the same way as the revenge thriller John Wick celebrates Keanu Reeves's return to the action genre, Peppermint marks Jennifer Garner's first time behind the barrel of a gun in almost exactly 11 years. Unfortunately, unlike John Wick, Peppermint just seems to be missing something. Revenge movies aren't exactly a new concept; we've seen this a million times in media, as with Max Payne, Payback, and The Punisher.
Peppermint is about a woman, Riley North, who sees her family gunned down by gang members on her daughter's birthday just a few days before Christmas. She picks the thugs out of a line-up and testifies against them in court, but the DA and the judge let them walk free. Riley proceeds to take a page out of Bruce Wayne's playbook and spend the next few years traveling the world and learning the tricks of the vigilante trade before returning home and exacting her own brand of justice on the people who wronged her. Sadly, the movie kinda fast-forwards through the bit where she takes out the people who actually pulled the trigger, which I would have liked to see a lot more of, and instead focuses on the boss who gave the order. The writers also tried to throw in a bit of a twist near the end that I couldn't help but feel was a little out of left field and didn't make a whole lot of sense.
Still, the action is the main reason for the film's existence, and it certainly doesn't disappoint on that front. It's been a long time since Alias happened, but even after a decade of family friendly movies, Jennifer Garner is still as deadly as ever. The plot doesn't have a whole lot going on, but it doesn't really need to when the gunplay is strong enough, and in that, Peppermint mostly delivers. A scene near the halfway mark even hints at the possibility of a sequel. If they can learn from their mistakes in this one, I'd love to see Riley work her way further up the gangsters' ladder.
Don't expect a deep storyline if you go to see Peppermint. Just enjoy the satisfaction of watching a lot of homeless bullets find a warm place to stay.",Peppermint

If She and Ben had stayed together we might have seen another Branjolina type pairing as in Mr and Mrs Smith.If you read the reviews on Rotten Tomato's I think we were watching 2 different movies.

We all love to see the bad guys get what they deserve, and it's enjoyable to see someone we like play it out believably for us. But to see a woman do it is more than a little improbable. It's hard to see a woman as remorseless and cold-blooded. And physically, most women are just too limp and loose to act quickly and decisively.I've seen some of Jennifer Garner's movies and she's never seemed capable of pulling off an action movie. I remember her as Elektra, for example, and she wasn't very convincing. But here, thanks to some clever direction and editing and a full commitment from Garner, she pulls it off every bit as well as any of the guys.OK, the story itself is pretty pedestrian, a retread in its umpteenth reincarnation. Still, such stories work time and again, for no doubt animalistic reasons, that women can appreciate, too.

While a good movie and a welcome addition to the canon of revenge flicks, it really does nothing to elevate it.

279,hugosoup,Peppermint is a very bad movie,2,14 October 2020,"This is a terrible action movie, the reviews defending this film and saying ""it's not as bad as the critics make it out to be"" are wrong. The audiences are way too generous to this miserable, inept excuse of a movie and the critics were spot on. It's badly acted, horribly written, poorly directed, and very generic by the numbers action film that is a poor imitation of actually okay movies like Taken and The Equalizer. I can't believe people give trash films like this a pass because you're supposed to turn your brain off. I like Jennifer Garner and entertaining action films, but this movie is poorly made garbage that is really badly written and annoyingly cliched. The similarly awful Death Wish remake with Bruce Willis came out the same year, do folks actually care if movies are good or not anymore? Well, it matters to people like me who expect films to have decent acting, writing, direction, pacing, or story. For people who actually want to think about what they watch and enjoy good, well-made, unique movies, don't bother with this one. It's really bad. Final Rating: 2/10",Peppermint

Almost every Mexican is a drug dealing gangbanger. It's a ridiculous revenge movie. There's a flashback to five years earlier where her family is wiped out (completely irrationally). The gangbangers who did it of course get away with it - or there is no movie - but in this magical tale she is able to hunt them all down five years later. Sure, the odds of three low level hit men all surviving the five years - and staying together - are quite slim, but that's one of the more realistic parts of the movie.She steals cars, she outfights every man, she closes a knife wound with a sanitary napkin, she kills and kills and kills (I would estimate 50, almost all at close range)... without ever once asking them what was in their wallet.Fantastic.",Peppermint

291,rowpotdroid,I'm giving up hope for Hollywood,2,26 November 2018,"These days movies have developed to the point of atrocious, they really are not worth reviewing. Seems I'm only coming here to write bad reviews but these movie maker who just want to score a few hundred million at the box office are bad actors looking for a payday.They say movie making is an art form, the art of ripping the public off. But here we have an action flick not unlike many others. A seemly 30 something suburban housewife and family get mowed down by a gang of drug dealers. The fast forward plot I'm sure gave the audiences whiplash. For this movie plot to have any credibility you'd need to Title the movie Wonder Women 3. Instead they go with a slender model like female where her most aggressive pass was fighting with her morning makeup. She transforms without the help of some superpower into this cyborg killing machine that disposes every gang banger no matter if she's outnumbered 50 to 1. I mean how many bullets can one carry. Learned all about weapons explosives, tactics and evasion techniques emerging from her supposed 5 year sabbatical in Europe. Something I might add is the total inept, incompetent police department inability to locate and capture a women who's pictures is on billboards. I mean my local parking ticket attendant would have done a better job. With no attempt on Garner's part to conceal her appearance other than a hoodie.They should have spoken to Stan Lee (RIP) the action comic book writer. He could have at least provided her with some believable super powers. Because without them it's an absurd story. Even the cheesiest action flicks from the eighties with all the same bad acting were a cut above. I suggest that Jennifer Garner stick to moves more suited to 100 lbs female leads in Romantic Comedies or Family Drama's or even Sci-Fi. But if she is set on being a kick ass action hero. Maybe she could reinvent Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I gave it a 2 star since for the reindeer bit part, it didn't have a choice to be in this movie and did a better job of acting.",Peppermint

And as for the violence, you are becoming sympathetic to the notion that guns are tools that can be used to solve some problems that are otherwise unsolvable such as getting rid of dirty cops and nasty criminals. The movie is quite raw with little misplaced sentiments and there are some funny moments too if you can appreciate them. You will get lost on the body count but there is no smoking, so we are saved. Considering it is a dark movie with lots of night shots you got to admire the lighting, cut well, never a dull moment.

Because all of them work for a major drug dealer named Garcia who is basically untouchable. Spoilers ahead: Does she get Garcia and the bad guys? Of course.

This is a solid revenge flick, good action, good cast and great pace. It is a movie made in the same spirit as John Wick; cold hard revenge action. John Wick also didn't have the best written script, it is awesome because of the focus on a bad ass out for revenge. What this movie lacks opposed to Wick is the cinematography, Peppermint isn't as stylish and well directed, but it gets the job done properly.tl;dr: solid revenge action flick for a movie night.

If there's a sequel to Peppermint, I hope they keep Jennifer Garner and perhaps take a few more notes from Charles Bronson's work in Death Wish because Death Wish was definitely smarter and stylish than this modern day. Most of Garner's acting was superb. She was real, some of the other actors were one dimensional though. They didn't have to and didn't try to work too hard in their roles which made flat. I consider the movie and the title of Peppermint and what it means as the sweetness of revenge. Well revenge we have.

They are blind to strong female protagonists who don't openly brag about being a woman while fighting the patriarchy. Hell they gave Captain Marvel like an 80,% and I've seen 2"" x 4""s emote more than Brie.Rather than having a rail thin 90lbs physique (Cough...Kristen Stewart in CA) and beating 200+lbs men in hand to hand combat, Garner feels believable, gets wounded often, and doesn't have endless mags.The plot is nothing new but well handled and directed. Not a John Wick level but far better than many other femme fatale flashy action flicks, or even most revenge movies. Sure there are plot holes, some unrealistic parts, but overall not to the point I really cared.For me, I was entertained the whole time.

Here we have the female Punisher if you will and though plenty of female vigilantes such as the Bride in Kill Bill or Jodie Foster's The Brave One came before I found Garner's role in this film to be memorable and well acted. The problem I had with this film was the lack of scenes depicting her ""training"". I would love to have seen some flashbacks of who trained her, how she found the trainer and how she became so knowledgeable about guns. Unlike other vigilantes such as Gerard Butler in Law Abiding Citizen she was not in any type of military or CIA. She was a regular civilian who worked at a bank so I think a litte glance into that would've been nice.

She plays a gun-toting killer after her daughter and husband are gunned down by members of an L.A. drug cartel. No new ground is covered in this story as she depopulates the drug underworld taking along a corrupt cop and a judge on the take along the way. She does a superb job in her role as a ""nothing to live for"" woman preferring to speak with her military style weapons instead of small talk. Sure, the plot gets out of whack in places and the acting chops of the others could've been improved but if you're into high body counts and wall-to-wall action, Peppermint won't leave a bad taste in your mouth.",Peppermint

A flash back of her time MIA shows her taking a beating, shows she learned to take blows and get back up. Adrenaline is fuel and most of us barely experience it to this extent to know our capabilities. What I found unbelievable was she survived the first shooting and came out of the coma with full knowledge and her capabilities. Good watch.

But they did show her violently murdering people barely shown or not seen at all doing her wrong (so there's no reason we should hate them other than they look like gangster).

The ridiculously negative reviews have me shaking my head, and make me feel like this review is necessary.
(disclaimer - I am by no-means a movie-critic-proreviewer-guy)
40+yr Male (w/ 40+yr old wife) watched this movie, and once the first 20-30 minutes, of an adequate amount of back story are complete, the pace hits 100mph.Jennifer Garner absolutely slays the role. She emotes the exact amount of crushed-sadden Mom to be believable; which serves as her fuel for the focus and passion a person would need to take on the 'Bad guys'. She isn't 'stiff' and she doesn't portray herself as being a cyborg/martial arts expert with super-human skills (though she is definitely bad-a**).It is (somewhat formulaic) within the Revenge-flick genre, but with a slight twist to ""make it their own"". And it does that without the Director/Writer coming across as desperate to do so.
If you enjoyed Taken, John Wick, Equalizer or are generally a fan of intense-action pack glory, I would predict you will enjoy this (very much).The trailers, interviews and promo's have portrayed this movie exactly as it is. It will not make you ""question existence"" or ""the meaning of life"" but the action, dialogue and acting should keep you engaged for the whole time.
My Wife immediately wanted to watch it again, and I was more than willing to hit restart. (even at 11:30pm)",Peppermint
321,maximize22,One of the worst I've seen in a long time,2,2 January 2019,"Ignore that the plot is a ripoff of The Punisher with some gender bending...
Ignore that any time Garner speaks it sounds like an extension of the Capitol One commercials where she talks to the audience like they're 3...
Ignore the tired, predictable tropes ('dirty police office is not who you suspect')...
Ignore that in *most* of these kinds of movies, the protagonist has prior military/police training, but that it's not impossible for a low income housewife to both disappear off the grid for an extended period of time while becoming a special ops quality combat/weapons expert in 4-5 years...
Ignore the unbelievable bits of combat, jumping off of buildings onto already injured limbs...
Ignore that the crime boss is so hell bent on revenge that he lets himself be drawn into a fight while at the same time exposing himself to the police...I'm not sure there's anything left in this movie after ignoring all of the bad acting and ridiculousness. I watched this after the remake of Death Wish - which wasn't the best, but at least had SOME believable aspects. Just awful, would not recommend to anyone (especially Alias fans, keep those memories golden).",Peppermint
322,bwc-maneke,Decent but poorly writen sends the wrong message,4,28 December 2020,"-Warning contains spoilers-Its hard to review this title without spoiling it. So lets dive into this trash.While I love Garner I dont think this is on her, but the opening scene alone doesn't make sense as does much of this movie. We open up with three gang bangers tatted up like its 1980 Santa Monica who open fire on a Family on a fair ground while driving a crown vic in a parking lot. That alone isn't whats screwy whats off is Apparently the Husband is or rather was involved with this gang somehow and the wifey somehow already knows about this. The amount of cringe taboo is just putting my eyes in the back of my skull. Queue sappy heart felt dramatic music with a silent scream and action. There was no attempt by the gang banger father after hearing the first shot to even seek cover or shield the child. Has my eyes roll further into the back of my head shaking in dumbfounded to this bs. So its already a story of a weak cowardly guy type with the ""strong female"" wow ground breaking work here. Its John Wick without the dog. Its Diehard 2 and not 1. If you want to make a movie like this it has to be believable and this hot trash isn't; Thats just the first 25minutes it gets worse, as a Wife and mother who just got home from the hospital after receiving a gun shot to the Head! by the way there's no exposition there at all was it a grazing shot? Next thing we know shes got short hair for no apparent reason other then to signify a mental decline. With no other friends or family at the house shes just putting things into boxes like la-de-da and in walks some unknown man doors not even locked lets himself right in. Again this is 30minutes in and im not sure If I can stomach this hot trash any further.

Any other movie with a similar plot, and there are a few of them with even bigger named stars not that she isn't a big name star, get far higher praise and aren't nearly as good or the main character not nearly as thought out. This is a revenge flick at it's finest. All the why's of the movie are laid out clearly, the characters motivation spelled out, and the acting based on the script is phenomenal. The only reason I could say this film isn't more highly regarded is because the vengeful character is not some brawny male actor because Jennifer kicked ass (acting and physically) in this movie and made the character far more believable than most other revenge based movies.",Peppermint

A basic suburban housewife doesn't just patiently take 5 years off, after her family is murdered, and become a superhuman killing machine, that takes out a hundred career gangsters alone.

326,TheSmallDeth,John Wick has a wife?,5,9 September 2018,"Today I went to see Peppermint,I have to admit it's a decent movie, the 29 metacritic score scared me at first but due to the interesting trailer i decided to go.The movie starts off pretty intense and you get introduced to the characters (which lack A LOT of backstory in my opinion) and then the 1,5 hour long shooting fest will begin. the movie felt like a replica of john wick, you get the dramatic start and after that it's some sort of shooting tutorial for a longgggg time which ends with a little bit of story again. It's all about action and almost zero about story or character development. This is why i can imagine why this movie got such a low score, but:Jennifer Garner does a decent job keeping the movie flowing due to limited lines and character background she has. Also some of the action scenes had some pretty interesting elements to it which was actually nice. The story feels a bit rushed and sometimes has a lot of holes in it. There was a lot of space to explain (A LOT seemed very unrealistic due to no explanation) more and dig deeper in specific events and characters but obviously there was no time left and the makers perfered trigger happy gangsters above storytelling. In the end it felt like another john wick movie with absolutely no satisfaction.. all by all it's neither a good or bad movie, it's amusing sometimes and that's all you're gonna get from it.",Peppermint

331,lathamv,the stars are for garner...,2,21 November 2019,"The rest is a predictable, over used storyline that is a huge waste of time. they spent way too much time on her vigilantism and not enough on character development. because of this, there is not nearly enough time to connect to her family or her situation. there isnt nearly enough information given to show what she did durning those 5 yrs. the relationship between the detectives is annoying. the ""gang bangers"" and ""drug lords"" are stereotypical. the homeless children and street people are placed in the storyline for the sole purpose of gaining sympathy. the court room situation and garners one-woman rampage taking out so many people but yet saving the homeless is completely unrealistic and unbelievable. adding in social media was only to appeal to a younger audience.normally, i enjoy ms garners movies. while her acting was typical of someone of her calibre, nothing else about this movie was entertaining, dramatic, enjoyable, or believable.",Peppermint
332,Ben-Brayev,What did i just watch?,1,14 September 2018,"What did i just watch? this is absolutely hilarious!!.
Lets go through the movie just as it was shown..She and her family get assassinated, but she survives.. then she recognizes the ciminals and there's a preliminary hearing, which then the judge decides there arent enough evidence to put the criminals in jail.. she goes crazy, and the police tries to get her admitted in a psychiatric hospital.. she escapes...
The next scene is the 3 criminals hanging from a Ferris wheel in the park the woman got assassinated in.. and then for the rest of the movie she kills an entire mafia.. How did this happen? how did a regular mom turned into the terminator? the only hint is the daughter at the start of the movie when she said to her mom ""you should've punched her lights out"" when the other mom from the school was kind of a brat.. thats the only hint.Anyway, it was really a waste of time.. i really love Jennifer garner though..",Peppermint

336,polarity_pictures,"meh, could be better.",3,5 December 2018,"So I saw this three times to get a good perspective on this movie. The plot is unbelievable. Cops are worthless. You can see the obvious traiing points form the training she got, seems like too strict and robotic. The editing is off. and the huge issue is Jennifer herself, can't get past her nice self. It's always in front, seems like she's gonna smile at ya. She needs grit and anger and it doesn't show. Sure there's violence, but is there enough to show how pissed off the character is? the story is supposed to be somewhat of a female punisher and it's not going that way. I want her cursing showing more vengeful acts, be mad! get out of LA, I know you live down the street, but still chose another city to put the story in. Just can't get past the ""Awe Shucks"" and waiting to see a ""FU"" instead.",Peppermint

339,t-ktinney,Great popcorn movie,8,15 May 2021,"I've watched Peppermint several times and never get bored. It's not academy award winning (although most Oscar winning movies suck), but it's entertaining from start to finish. Jennifer Garner is an underrated actress and she does a great job in this movie playing both the victim and the revenge seeking mother & wife. She has always had the ""girl next door"" look & reputation so seeing her in a bad ass role like this is highly entertaining. The movie starts slow but it's still not boring, and after about 30 minutes in it kicks into overdrive and the action is non stop. There were a few very sad scenes and a few sarcastic one-liners. Jennifer Garner owns the role. The only negative is she's the only well known actor in the movie and I think if the movie were given a better title it would've done better at the box office when it was released. I know several people that think this is a kids or family movie and that's why they've passed on it. Get yourself some snacks and sit back and watch the movie and enjoy the ride.",Peppermint

343,inquiringminds,"Badassery at its finest, Jennifer Garner is back!!!",9,11 September 2018,"This right here is the Jennifer Garner I love! I know the fanboys didn't care for her Elektra, but I loved her, & I loved her as Sydney Bristow in Alias way back during its original 5 season run. I do like her in other genres like 13 Going on 30, Dallas Buyers Club, Juno, & The Kingdom, but IMO she needs to do more action thrillers, she has that rare ability to show so much badassery without feeling contrived. She was almost like a female Punisher in this, she even portrayed her character as good as Keanu portrayed John Wick. I know a lot of guys will not agree with me at all about that as I've seen a lot of low ratings & most of the critics were not impressed, so maybe you just gotta be a mom to relate to her character of Riley North & feel her pain & angst, & wanting justice so badly she will go through sheer hell to make it happen. I would love to see a series developed from her character for future stories, I don't think a franchise or sequels would ever happen, but if this little film can make enough at the box office, it should be considered as a 10 episode season for Netflix or Amazon Prime following her character as she continues on her path of saving the helpless from the villains of the big city. With the right writer, it would make a really good series.",Peppermint

But I still think Jennifer Garner is capable of much better films.",Peppermint
348,wingzero203,Honestly Good & Not Hollywood Ridiculous,9,10 December 2020,"Imagine the Punisher's back story but gender swapped and you get Peppermint. But what I really enjoyed about this movie is that Hollywood doesn't turn Jennifer Garner's character into an invulnerable, superhuman revenge machine that cannot be stopped. She's clearly had weapons & martial arts training but isn't infallible as a character.The whole ""female badass heroine"" idea didn't really strike me as revolutionary. I've been enjoying female heroines since Alien (1979), Aliens (1986), and the Terminator movies as a kid so I perceived Garner's character as a vigilante who happened to be female. Her tactics, ingenuity, and quick-thinking are what impressed me and what allowed her to do the extensive damage she does in the movie.There's no over-the-top action, plot, or crazy CGI & camera shake/angles. However unlike other vigilante movies like Deathwish (both the OG and the remake), Garner's character purposely went and got herself trained and doesn't rely on sheer luck and opportunity to get things done. Other movies like The Punisher, Taken, and the Equalizer involve protagonists who have had military and/or espionage/tradecraft training which they conveniently utilized to dispense justice and thus give them an advantage.Bottom line, Peppermint is a solid revenge action flick that's great to watch and tells you just how much a mother will do for her family.",Peppermint

I tend to predict the outcome of situations, and a was wrong much of the time. Which to me, is always my favorite experience while watching a movie.
I hate to say this, but the only reason I can see why the critic gave it such poor review is because it has a woman lead. I could be wrong about that, but I really can't find an issue with the story or quality. The storyline is great, the acting is outstanding, and I got emotionally invested. Having the review critics gave doesn't make sense to me. I could say it may be about the combat quality, but with my knowledge of other movies, the fighting in this movie is the same (wonderful) quality as other popular action movies.
I HIGHLY recommend!",Peppermint
353,ssheikh_11,Jennifer Garner is Back :),8,10 September 2018,Finally! A role Jennifer Garner excels in. I miss Sydney Bristow dearly so this was a welcome sight.

354,squodge,"This film is basically John Wick, but with a woman instead.",8,26 April 2020,"It's funny how John Wick is considered an amazing film (plus its sequels), yet the critics pan this film. Peppermint has a high death count in it, just like John Wick - both feature a protagonist who've lost two loved ones (in Wick's case, his wife and his dog).The main difference that I can tell between the two films is that John Wick is a pretentious film, whereas Peppermint just gets on with it. Perhaps that's why the critics hate Peppermint... because it feels too 'raw', whereas John Wick is all ""nice and shiny"". John Wick is praised for having OTT killing; Peppermint is criticised for it.Okay, so Peppermint is never going to win 'best film' award or anything like that, but I get the impression the writers and director just wanted to create an action film that didn't require too much cranium activity. In other words, John Wick but with a woman instead. Both films are forgettable for the same reasons, but they are also both enjoyable rollercoaster rides. Bring out the popcorn, bring out the booze, switch off your brain (because this film isn't about Stephen Hawking's theory on the universe), and enjoy!My score 7.5 out of 10 (rounded up to 8). The score is based on enjoyment, not on cerebral activity requirements.",Peppermint

356,anagent,Good action movie showing that revenge can be satisfying,10,28 November 2018,"This movie will appeal greatly to those who have lost loved ones and have been let down by our bleeding heart justice systems. We all need to take some revenge from time to time, it helps us deal with those ugly episodes in our lives that are inflicted upon us by others.
It is a great idea to let the criminal justice system work, when it does work but even then it robs us of our basic need to personally let those who set out to do us wrong know that we are not going to let them get away with it.This movie provides justification for revenge and in most ways it is relatable.
It has some far fetched traits as well, of the kind that reside in the minds of the deluded unrealists of our time who want to make us believe that its possible that a 90lb woman can throw 200lb men around like rag dolls.
Leaving that aside it has some superb action sequences and a reasonable unexpected twist.
Jennifer Garner plays the part extremely well and she is very convincing in her strength and determination. The bad guys who always seem to be drug dealers are really bad.If you are looking for a movie that agrees with your idea that the law does not always work then this one is for you and the same can be said for anyone looking for a good action flick.",Peppermint

You watch a woman driven by revenge become an unstoppable force of the universe who somehow managed to kill everyone and beat an entire drug cartel, while avoiding the police that wants her as well. Clichés, some humor and some suspense moments, but nothing out of the box.The acting was actually good, the action scenes are aesthetically well done not considering the little credibility they have. It was kind of an entertaining flick to watch for the most part. So it has its favorable points.On the other hand, for some reason this type of -unconventional superhero- movies it's really popular, and it's okay. But this was a reminder for myself about why I'm not into them.
Not the type of person who demands ""super realism"" in movies, but I can't enjoy randomness or situations that get silly out of the little credibility they evoke.4/10",Peppermint

363,nemesis222,Enjoyable if slightly rushed revenge flick,7,30 November 2018,"I was surprised by this film. It is a usual leave brain at door revenge flick with more than a touch of John Wick influence.
Jennifer Garner does a great job though and as proven before she can deliver action in a believable way (and her stunt double of course.)
I did think that I felt a little rushed and an extra 15 minutes added to help explain what she had been up to in the 5 years away to prepare herself would have really helped and perfectly set up the ""oh you guys are in trouble now"" moment when she finally returns.......but, instead it just jumps in and the importance killings ....the ones who should family aren't even shown, so I all felt a bit rushed and muddled in the first part of the film.

You can be a large population of lifetime street hardened criminals, but you have no chance against a scorned woman, even if she looks like a model. At lease pick a female lead that looks the part.

None of the characters seem to have any blood inside them either. Literally shoots a guy point blank in the head and barely a drop of ketchup. Also this lady has mutant powers the likes of which wolverine can only dream of. Case in point she gets shot and is on her feet in hours. She gets tasered and smashes her head against metal bars but two minutes later she's escaping from the feds on foot. Literally every scene is riddled with holes in continuity and the storyline is non existent. She goes to europe and returns later as an invincible mutant combat specialist with no explanation as to the what's, why's or how's and she then takes revenge on the guys who killed her family which tbh there was virtually no explanation or justification for. None of the characters are likeable and the lead is highly annoying. Not much more I can say on this film other than it must have been penned by a 12 year old because I am genuinely struggling to believe an adult mind couldn't come up with something better than this even if by accident and the worst part is it didn't even feature a cook.",Peppermint

403,tjroll5,Great storyline not enough detail,9,10 March 2020,"This story reflects the deathwish
Vigilante theme with a female lead.
The movie starts out with a happy family of 3 starting out
With various small problems . the husband has a floundering garage mechanic shop and is desperate in need of money ad even briefly entertains an idea of his friends plan to rob a drug dealer.His daughter is having peer troubles not really fitting in with the snobbish social order of the classmates and neighboring children as well as their parents.After a failed birthday party which was upstaged by a sudden children's event involving the daughter and mother of snobby parent .
They decide to take their daughter out to the amusement park instead.
After a fun time of togetherness. Her husband and daughter are brutally gunned down by the drug cartel gang who mistakenly saw him as the thieving accomplice of his friend who planned to rob them.After catching and brutally murdering the friend of her husband who sought his help in the robbery of which he refused. They put a hit out on him anyway to set an example.She is also shot in the driveby but survives.Seeking justice after identifying the three suspects she realizes the corruptive power of the drug cartel in the judicial system as she watches the three go free and herself remanded a phsyciatric hospital when she freaks out in the courtroom hearing their dismissal.She escapes from custody the ambulance transporting her to the hospital. steals 50000 from her former place of business and vanishes abroad.Flash forward we see a wave of vigilante justice occurring where the 3 bodies of the killers are hung like Christmas ornaments from the ferris wheel at the amusement park where her family was killed.The gang and her clash throughout the movie as their numbers dwindle along with the bodies of the corrupt officials.
The good part is that its not like wonder super woman doing amazing supernatural stunts in her quest. But just a seemingly normal woman very pissed off exacting her vengeful justice.I would have liked to see more detail of how she first reappeared after five years. Instead of just seeing the 3 criminals hanging there then the investigators piecing it together.Also how she killed the prosecutor attorney and the defense attorney instead of just hearing they were found floating in the pool.
Overall it was a good movie just would've liked to see more details

All government bureaucracies have powerful incentives to grow, regardless of whether or not such growth actually serves the public.

414,jendett,A semi could fall through the plot holes,5,7 September 2018,"This film gets 5 stars because it is full of action, and I love Jennifer Garner, and on the negative side, it is full of plot holes, implausibilities, and despite being career criminals, the bad guys can't hit anything when they shoot.First, the movie name. The only reference to Peppermint in the whole movie was when her daughter ordered that flavor of ice cream right before she dies. Why does that mean the whole movie is named Peppermint? The lawyer comes to bribe her. A cartel doesn't have anyone else to do that? It has to be the someone who will be in court? I though that was the purpose of underlings? The cop turns out to be dirty. Then why did he pull her out of the hospital to identify the suspects, against medical advice? Why not just let it go down to ""the suspects couldn't be identified"". That made no sense at all.The villain in the movie was inconsistent. He guns down a little girl (in public in front of witnesses) for someone considering robbing him, but he hesitates to kill the homeless kids? Jennifer Garner goes from incompetent person to ninja in just 5 years? With no formal training? She just gets it from surviving on the streets? Those kind of skills take a lot longer than 5 years to accomplish, and I bet they cost more than $10K/year to acquire.If you go, have low expectations, and then you will not be disappointed.

Pros:
-great concept.Cons:
-The watcher was never able to identify with out heroine. She basically was a charactercher and it made it hard to root for her.-Unfortunately, this movie jumped ahead and we weren't able to take the ride with her. We saw the aftermath.
All the people the viewer would want dead were already dead by the time the film jumped ahead five years. The lawyer who tried to bribe her, the three gangsters who killed her family...all dead.
-the only thing we got a front row seat to her trying to take down the guy who ordered the hit.

You probably know Jennifer Garner from her Capital One commercials or her overly publicized three-year divorce proceedings from rehabbed Ben Affleck. Yet, not too long ago she was Sidney Bristow, a sexy undercover spy, in J.J. Abrams' Alias. Or you might remember her as the beautiful sword swinging ninja assassin-for-hire in Marvel's Elecktra? In Peppermint, Jennifer Garner returns with a vengeance.
 
Riley's super cute 9-year-old daughter (Cailey Fleming - Star Wars: The Force Awakens) and handsome husband (Jeff Hephner - Interstellar) are in the movie just long enough to for you to fall in love with them and becomes outraged when they are machine gunned down by the L.A. Mexican drug cartel while innocently eating peppermint ice cream cones at the Carnival. Despite Riley identification of the face tattooed killers in a line up, the corrupt judge lets them go. Enraged, Riley goes off the grid for five years hiding in L.A.'s Skid Row, training and preparing to exact her revenge. Director Pierre Morel (Taken) knows action movies, and like Taken this one is no exception. Sometimes when a movie is firing on all cylinders it is criticized for being too formulaic.

Just like Garner's price for staring in this tripe!I'm sure she didn't get 1 million for this trash....Truth be told, the female FBI agent's acting was better than garner's!!!This is the exact reason why Hollywood doesn't care to bring us quality scripts, screen plays, actors that can act and good scripts for them to act from.So Hollywood keeps churning out garbage like this, because simple minded people in America are so dumb, that they like the dumbest, simplest, nonsensical movies that are made today.I happen to be one of those individuals that can't turn off my brain, when watching a movie.I feel sorry for this country, its filled with a bunch of morons.America is going to hell in a hand basket.....",Peppermint

The movie had good pacing and it didn't waste time to get Jennifer into her killing spree, she carried the whole movie, set on her mission.
Her body language was well directed as not to be a martial art expert but more of an emotional wreck that has a great punch & reflex in her,
I wished the baddies was a bit more of a challenge to her but we never get interested in their strengths. And that moustache of the boss , you knew he had it coming.

The only thing was I did not feel the emotional pull from this movie like I did with Rambo. There is quite a bit of killing and blood but it is an action film--it is to be expected. Not a bunch of talking. Husband also liked it---said it wasn't too bad (he is mostly only into action movies). There did not seem to be a lot of cursing (which a lot of action movies have way to much of) so that was nice.,Peppermint

467,littlebrownclown,Ashes to Phoenix,7,10 September 2018,"I am a fan of Alias, so I love Jennifer Garner in these roles. The plot sounded exciting and the previews were good, so I was ready to roll tonight at the theater. The movie was promising from the opening scene, so my hopes were high. As it unfolded, though, I felt slightly more disconnected from her character when the opposite should be true. Maybe it's my fault for absolutely expecting to see some of the journey from ashes to phoenix, but I love back stories on why and HOW victims/survivors become vigilantes and avengers. Unfortunately, the best HOW I got was a YouTube video the cops found of her cage fighting during her years in hiding. Had the HOW she became such a ferocious, unstoppable force been included in the movie, I would have given it a 10. (Also, if the inhabitants of skid row worshipped her as their Angel of Justice, why didn't any of them TRY to stop the drug kingpin and his crew from killing her?)Peppermint had unrealized potential that was probably filmed and later edited out in favor of more violent assassination scenes, but maybe not. Either way, being able to watch her development pre-emergence and put myself in her place as the avenger-in-training would have given me more value. Having said all of this, I would certainly be open to a Peppermint 2: Angel of Justice.",Peppermint

But it is also as enjoyable as Taken, Die Hard, and any Bruce Willis or Keanu Reeves action flick. No real spoilers, just hints...The movie is about a mother taking her pain and turning it into justice for her family. Jennifer Garner is great in this role and is able to carry the pain of losing a child with a hard core unempathetic killing spree.Where I felt this movie could have been better was in the backstory. She went from mother to bad ass in 5 years. How? You see a small minor clip but it leaves a lot to the imagination. You also get foreshadowing in a drug cartel conversation but it goes nowhere. The ending leaves it open for a 2nd film, but if so, I wish they set it up a little better. I completely enjoyed this movie. It will be definitely added to my re-watch line-up.The critics want there to be more plot development but do they want those things for any male led action roles? Not particularly.

471,stvstt,Haven't I seen this one about a Hundred times before...?,5,21 September 2019,"A wholly derivative story played limply. The plot is a well-worn premise: Garner's family is mowed down by a vengeful crime boss; The justice system lets her down, so she seeks a deadly revenge herself. Initially disappearing after the murders, only to re-emerge gun totting Nemesis.I was promised an 'action thriller' by the trailers. Well, there was plenty of action, but no thriller content. You could skip the middle hour of this movie and not miss a thing -apart from the kill rate, but who's counting if this is what you want?The acting was perfunctory, with Garner's one-dimensional Medea looking mean and handing out pithy one-liners. There was no depth to either the criminals or the police. They pretty much played cartoonish cut outs and more wooden than Noah's Ark. The movie allowed for competant acting, but 'good acting' is debatableAt every opportunity you are obliged to suspend belief. Apparently, Garner develops ruthless assassin skills before returning to act out her revenge. There are no details of this. Apparently, she has been surveilling the Crime bosses operations, yet there is no evidence of this. Perhaps more worrying is the fact that local police, with a flick of a mouse, can trace the whereabouts of citizens anywhere in the world. Fortunately, implausible.If you want a non-demanding shoot fest, conveyer belt type movie, then this ones for you. The only benefit this movie could have is to provide a Christmas list of 'must have' military assault rifles for inchy-fingered NRA members.A movie worth avoiding, but watch it if you really feel you have to!",Peppermint

It is very very well done and I don't think they could have cast a better lead than Jennifer Garner (I'm no fan of Jennifer Garner either). This is a great revenge film and even my husband had to comment that it's up there with some of his favorite revenge flicks (Taken, Law Abiding Citizen, John Wick, Gladiator, et al).

As a mother loving deeply her husband and daughter, plus the fact that the system was corrupted and against her, it's not hard to understand with all the pain she went through, to become an assassin.

In movies, typically this is a male actor but it is refreshing to have a female lead playing this part.The movie did not grab me in the first five minutes but slowly built. The last half of the movie was nonstop action with plot twists here and there.Jennifer Garner is an excellent actress but was not given much great material to work with, in my opinion. The screenwriters baked in very little character development and that always results in shallow, cardboard characters.The ending had a nice little plot development, which is discussable.All in all, an OK movie to watch at home but don't expect the wow factor to be there.",Peppermint

492,natebarbone,"Don't believe all of the fake IMDB reviews, this movie makes no sense and is cliches-by-numbers",3,25 September 2018,"I never write reviews, but I was compelled to after seeing all of the fake reviews here. I just saw this movie and it made absolutely no sense and was just cliche after cliche with no depth or logic. I mean really, IMDB, a 10/10??? For starters, the title has nothing to do with anything. It is completely pointless, they never revisit any association with peppermint beyond her daughter at the beginning. The crux of this movie with her family being killed is based on a random plot point that is not developed at all, and we see no reason why it should even be there in the first place. Mr. Whitebread Guy wants to make a better life for his family even though they appear to live well and have no problems. Why did any of this need to happen?? Some rando at his job gives him the idea to rob a Mexican drug dealer, which makes all the sense in the world. Why didn't he just start selling drugs instead? And why isn't Jennifer Garner mad at her husband for bringing this on himself?? He is the reason for all of the trouble. Much of the dialogue is cliched and forced exposition, and the delivery is so apathetic that you wonder if they knew the camera was rolling. Jennifer Garner holds people at gunpoint and then talks like a regular conversation. Also she manages to look fabulous for 90% of her rampage. I know you're supposed to suspend disbelief for movies, but this movie is just completely unreal. The court scene is an absolute joke. The defense uses ""evidence"" that is never admitted in court which apparently is strong enough to end the whole case right there. Her lawyer doesn't even say anything (which I guess is supposed to be part of the whole ""crooked system"" trope). We are supposed to believe that the criminal justice system would side with three Mexican gang members over a white lady whose family had been murdered, no questions asked. Then we don't even see her take revenge on the people who are directly responsible for her misery! And how did she tie them up on a ferris wheel? The whole premise relies on the idea that a suburban white lady is entirely more competent than the FBI and Mexican mafia. She outwits and outguns everybody and somehow manages to stay off the map even when they are following her every move. It's not all bad, there are some good action sequences and a lot of the kills are satisfying. The action scenes were the best part of the movie, everything else was nonsense. It's getting late so I'll wrap things up. The other part that made absolutely no sense was the fact that she didn't kill Garcia because he had a daughter, but then she kills him anyway. What is the reasoning for this?? She misses her chance to kill him because she doesn't want to orphan his daughter, then she kills him and miraculously escapes being shot by the police (they showed her getting shot but then she doesn't have any bullet wounds?). What happens to Garcia's daughter?? I guess she's just chopped liver now, who cares. Why couldn't the FBI bring this guy down on their own time? There are so many unanswered questions that I came here to write about how nonsensical it was. The real world does not apply here in any way. Also, Method Man doesn't do anything!! He's completely underutilized, and it would have been nice to see him actually have a role. Come to think of it. most of the characters don't do anything, they are merely there as placeholders. Most of them aren't even given names and they just say cliched dialogue to tell you what is happening.",Peppermint

These creatures are so far up their own buttholes, that their favorite pastime is to contort their bodies until it reaches their assess, then they push their noses up their buttholes so they can take a full blown hit of their most deadly smelling farts, which they inhale until their brains rot! 
One of the criticism of this movie is that is racist because it portrays the drug cartel exactly as it is. These cartels inflict horrible violence throughout Mexico and Central America that often washes over our shores. The reason why so many refugees are seeking asylum at our border is to flee the types of violent, cruel men portrayed in the movie. Those refugees stand testament to how ruthless the Mexican/Central American drug cartel is. But of course, somehow portraying this reality is racist. No one is saying all latinos are violent drug dealers, stupids. SMH! As a matter of fact, it is a latino who helps Riley get her freedom back at the end. The dirty cops and judges are white men, so NO, it's not just latinos who are portrayed bad, dumbfuqs!
DO NOT LISTEN TO THESE ROTTEN CRITICS! They have nothing better to do than shit on great movies. They get their ""let's shit on this movie"" orders, and execute.

The FBI decide to go public and the media are told about Riley, social media goes wild, discussing the rights and wrongs of vigilante Riley.Riley goes on to find the Cartel's money laundering warehouse and kills everyone, then burns the millions of dollars there. The Cartel boss, guesses that Riley will next head to their drug lab, so set her up, planting explosives there. Riley spots the explosives and manages to escape as the lab is blown up.Riley finds the two Cartel guys who blew up the lab and kills them, not before finding out where the Cartel boss lives, she drives their car back to the house, with the dead guys still in the front. They are let inside and Riley goes about killing all the henchmen before seeking out the Cartel boss, who she is about to kill, then his daughter comes out looking for her father, which distracts Riley, the boss stabs her and escapes.Police gather at the boss's house and Carmichael's partner argues with another police office, accusing him of not providing Carmichael with vital info, regarding the Cartel's activity. The police officer tells him, he had been trying to contact Carmichael for days. At that point, the partner realises Carmichael's a dirty cop.Meanwhile Carmichael meets with the female FBI agent at a down and out tent ""city"", where she has discovered, Riley hides out and it transpires, helps and protects the homeless people who live there. Corrupt Carmichael kills the FBI agent and then phones the cartel boss to tell him where Riley is. The boss and his henchmen all arrive at tent city in search of Riley, who has sent footage to a news station of the cartel and of dirty cop Carmichael. She tells everyone to come to Tent City, news crews, police etc.The boss then grabs one of the tent city kids and threatens to kill her if Riley doesn't come out of her hiding place. Riley concedes and the boss releases the girl and proceeds to beat up Riley, who mocks him as he hits her. The police arrive along with helicopters and presumably the henchmen are arrested. The boss shoots Carmichael, assuming he's double crossed them. Riley finds the boss, who has run away and attacks him. Carmichael's partner implores her not to kill him, but she does and is shot by other officers, but somehow escapes.Carmichael's partner finds Riley, lying injured at the grave of her husband and daughter. Riley is rushed to hospital and lies handcuffed to a bed. The partner visits her and it would seem has slipped her the key to the cuffs. The film ends with an empty bed and the open cuff, still attached to the bed. Riley has escaped.I really enjoyed this film, love a film where the baddies get what they deserve.

As some have said, the plot has been done many times before, however, not typically with a female vigilante.

I think I've seen everything she's done and enjoyed them all. I even enjoyed this one, but..This film is essentially Charles Bronson's Death Wish with boobs. That's OK. I can get into a bad-ass female lead (which is where Hollywood is taking us now, over and over). But the writer took a mental vacation in the third act.Spoilers next:So the bad guys blow up the drug lab and she makes her escape just fine. She's dazed on the street, still carrying her M16 when a passerby stops to see if this filthy woman with a machine gun is ""OK"". She steals his car. No problem. And then she goes in pursuit of two bad guys in a black SUV. A car and occupants that she's never seen before and who have a nice lead while she's carjacking the innocent bystander. Not OK. How did she know to follow them and overcome the three-five minute lead? No way.She catches them on Mulholland drive, passes them, blocks the road and kills them. OK. She takes the SUV and continues on Muholland. How does she know where to go? How does she know when she gets there? Nope.And then she rigs the car somehow (off camera) to slow roll along the circular driveway. Tiny brick on the accelerator? She follows along on foot executing bad guys by the numbers until the SUV mysteriously speeds up to 40MPH or so and crashes into the house. Everything after that was semi-plausible as shoot-em-ups go, but come on! Give me a thread of logic and reason to hold onto, please? Oh, I still love Jen!",Peppermint

Family gets killed, spouse somehow turns into a complete assassin, goes on a killing spree taking down everyone involved. I don't understand why Hollywood doesn't even try anymore. There isn't any story, plot, or emotion to pull you into the movie. It was boring and very poorly written. A seven year old could write a more interesting and creative script.

546,cawlztothewall-76125,No more or less than what one would expect,5,23 September 2018,"Jennifer Garner is back; I'll leave the quality of her return performance up for debate. ""Peppermint"" is little more than ""Death Wish"" with a female protagonist (?). Every move is predictable. The storyline is a little ridiculous, and every character but Garner's is utterly useless in the plot. If this is NOT the kind of movie you're into, end your reading here and skip this movie.If this is what you're into, continue reading: you won't be disappointed. The action is done well, although difficult to take seriously. There are no slow moments or gaps in the storyline. While I did state above that characters outside of Garner's new basically unnecessary, their acting is convincing and skilled; acting quality can make or break a movie. You'll find plenty of chaos and carnage in this new revenge action thriller that portrays the lengths to which a normal, middle-class mom will go to seek justice. There's something to be learned here!",Peppermint

550,bowerjulie,"Decent acting, but horrible storyline",2,6 February 2021,"Jennifer Gardner makes both a believable badass, as well a believable suburban mom. The storyline in this movie...not so much. It was so predictable & while the action was continuous, it would've made a much better movie if they actually told the story of how she turned from an ordinary housewife/mom into a fully trained, combat ready, fighting machine...enough to singlehandedly take down a Mexican drug cartel, as well as corrupt officials of the law.",Peppermint

It is hands down better than John Wick, Deathwish or The Punisher, and on a par with The Equalizer. The reason it scores low from a lot of people is, I think, because Jennifer Garner is a woman, which doesn't sit comfortably with the kind of meathead that makes up a significant proportion of the target audience for a revenge flick.",Peppermint
553,rekless83,Great action movie,9,10 September 2018,It was nice seeming Jennifer garner step back into the action role. The story has been done similarly in death wish and death sentence. Though it was a nice spin making the main star a female lead. Even though the bare bones of the story has been done before this movie didn't feel predictable or stale. It even had a nice twist I'm the third act.,Peppermint

She goes after cops, court officials, gangsters, and even girl scout leaders. Poorly written, and loses itself in a psychotic twisting of story line. Hey, if you just like to see stuff blown up and little girls with outrageously large guns...knock yourself out. Garner's performance wasn't as good or believable as her commercials. Watch it to see the stupidity. Hollywood has lost it's way. I use Hollywood in the loosest terms. This is a joint Chinese/French submission. What do they know about good, believable, entertaining violence?",Peppermint

559,groopz,Expectations unfulfilled,6,21 November 2018,"I am a big fan of action movies and I waited a lot for this flick to come, specially after I watched the trailer. Honestly speaking, the trailer was better than the movie.For the first 45 minutes through the movie, I was worrying probably I will end up moving away from watching till the end. The first half had nothing of ""Action"" and it seemed like a pure Drama, and a good Drama. I do not like Dramas personally, but for it's goodness I rated it 5 stars. the additional one star is for the final action scene that was somewhat good, predictable but okay, no harm watching something I've seen several times in many movies before.I still wonder how she killed the the real killers of her family, no one knows how, we find them dead real soon. And in the opening scene of the movie, I do not know why she killed that man, what he did, no backdrop on that. She managed to find out all hideouts and whereabouts of all her enemies, nobody knows how without having an ally.It was a charm watching the Feds working happily with the local PD. The police looked more active than the Feds. Wow. The filmmakers did a great job glorifying the bad cop and maligning the good one to build up the climax. They actually tried too hard just to manage making the story more predictable and ruin the suspense.Jennifer Garner did a good job as we can expect from her. The rest of them are like passersby. The main villain seemed like a street thug, who added the genre ""Tragedy"" to the movie.Finally, my suggestion to all movie lovers is to watch this movie, cause its entertaining. But, to typical action movie lovers, I must say no, don't watch, cause there is neither pepper nor mint for you.",Peppermint
560,deviah-248-74953,Kick-ass action movie,8,7 September 2018,"No going to dwell on the action too much. It starts with the Jennifer Garner's character losing her husband and young daughter to a drug cartel hit, for something her husband didn't do.Although she IDs the killers, turns out that everyone from the judge down is corrupt and the killers walk free. Instead, the judge pronounces her a nutcase orders that she be taken into custody. She escapes and disappear for five years and then comes back to wreak retribution on all those responsible.The action sequences are really good. Every now and then, a dramatic actor turns into an action hero. Some (most famously, like Liam Neeson) succeed, some don't. Jennifer Garner is one of those who does succeed.The action scenes are really kick-ass and we the audience are there to cheer her own as she dispatches one low-life after another. The movie is open-ended, but that's because they must already be planning a sequel. Hope it does well and there is one.So what can you crib about? There's some choppy cutting involved. Some of the killing takes place off-screen, I suspect the scenes are shot and were left out for whatever reason. Logic is never something you look for in movies like this, but I'd like to know what chain-an-pulley system she used to string three huge dead men from the top of a Ferris wheel.Bugger all that.

566,janssen86,Jenniffer Garner back as Action Hero in Movie Directed by Pierre Morel,8,11 September 2018,"I hesitated to watch this movie after the critics' damning reviews. However after a few minutes I was pleasantly surprised indeed. Jenniffer Garner stars in a very satisfying action/revenge flick, which offers all the drama, plot twists, anger, action, grit and realease you expect from a good movie of this genre.The main (but not only!) twist is Garner herself, who starts off apparently as in some of her previous roles (I thought of in ""Butter"" and ""Alexander""), but turns into the opposite (e.g. as in ""Elektra"" or ""Alias""). In fact, the movie occasionally pokes fun at itself through this contrast.Technically, the action and fight scenes were well done indeed. No, the scenes weren't realistic, but so isn't John Wick and we don't go into action movies for a glimpse of the real world. Pierre Morel had also directed e.g. ""From Paris with Love"" and ""96 Hours"" and his craft shows.The only beef I have is her fuzzy path from ordinary mum to female Jack Reacher. I feel like this phase could have been fleshed out with a bit more conflict and decisions.All in all, a great movie for an evening out with lots of popcorn! I am looking forward to see more of Garner in such movies under the direction of Morel.",Peppermint

It has nothing to do with social politics. Just a strong storyline with a strong lead like Jennifer combined with solid film making.
Plotline is simple yet intreaging and the dark athmosferic mood created throughout the film is really fitting to the main charecter.
Riley played by Jennifer Garner is a ruthless and skilled killer with one mission in mind. The film was a joy to watch and I wish it would have been just a tad longer for some even deeper charecters to evolve.",Peppermint

This time, though, our hero is a woman. She spends the needed time to prepare, then deals with the villains appropriately.As with all good revenge films, evil is seen as it is: evil, and good, while seen as weaker, triumphs.I find no major faults in this movie. The acting is convincing, the storyline is good and reflects some of the challenges we see to our justice system every day, the character development is sufficient yet brief enough that they get to the action quickly.

I have watched some bad movies and I have been known to love some ""bad"" ones , actually I like a lot of bad movies . I have yet to venture into reviewing films and I do not intend on deaply reviewing this one. That all said , this one is horrible. If you saw the trailer you saw the movie , or better yet the better version of it. Every scene is predictable as is the dialog . Not only is the movie horribly written and predictable it is sterotypical and in my opinion aimed at the middle American trump supporters. Half of the Mexican gang are ridiculously stereo typed and cast by non Mexicans. The police are dumb downed as if this was written by a 12 year old . To sum it up this is somewhat of a cheesy Steven sagal movie from the 80's except there's no Steven segal and honestly me even comparing it to one of his films is an insult. I have been to the theaters 18 times this year and all where good even the two that where sub par are dominate over this film . I rank it a three out of ten stars only because the picture quality and a few of the action scenes. And any less then 3 is almost unbelievable to accomplish.",Peppermint

Boy though, is she ever still a thing. She absolutely kills it in this film.The story is good enough to keep you invested, and that's all it takes, because the action is not only good, but also an almost constant ride. The choreography is brutal, the gunfire is on point, and all the bad ends are satisfying to watch. They don't pull any punches and the cuts emphasize the execution of the fights rather than try to cover it up. The movie delivers on all the fronts where an a revenge-themed action movie could possibly deliver.I want to see more of pretty much everything in the movie.

609,jmccarthy56,Only good to Garner fanboys,2,3 December 2020,"I typically don't leave reviews, but this cult of J. Garner is pitiful. How this movie was rated this high is beyond me. Then again we do have a culture of rewarding mediocrity.Right off the bat let's start with acting. She has literally 3 facial expressions with little deviation. There was a scene where an antagonist (neighbor) called and invited her to a party after a previous snappy encounter earlier. She leaned on the counter, and I had no idea what emotion she was trying to convey. Maybe it didn't come through the botox or something, but I leaned to my wife like, ""I don't understand her reaction? What are we supposed to take from that?""And yes it sounds like I'm hard on her, but acting across the board was bad. The cartel head would stalk with a stereotypical chicano dialect in some scenes, and absolutely no accent at all in other scenes. My wife and I constantly shook our heads at how pitiful this was.Everyone gives Jen this badass moniker from Alias I suppose, but this was bad. And I get this is just entertainment, but geesh we had to completely suspend belief in some areas like physics & health. For example, she's roughly 140lbs soaking wet. You're trying to tell me that she was able to not only kill, but string up THREE grown men upside down from 40ft up in the air? Really? So she got her femoral artery sliced, which she fixed with vodka & staples. Then she got shanked in her side numerous times, and she was shot 5 times. Yet she was still going? Not only going, but could disappear. I guess she acquired that skill while UFC training underground overseas.I guess. This flick was ridiculous, so please don't use words like strong, good, believable, brilliant, etc. You need to expand your palate. Call it for what it is.

Its essentially a story of revenge that carries the same energy as John Wick. Like most movies centered around the premise of revenge, the set up is important. This movie did that excellently. At some points the movie slowed down (queue a scene of Jennifer thinking about her family). However I didn't go see Peppermint for the emotional backstory. I saw it for the action so that is what I'm gauging much of my review on. And it was great. A lot grittier than I was expecting. The fight scenes were also very well choreographed and a lot of fun.

621,JonVanderHorn,"Setting the Standard, for an Action Film.",10,8 October 2018,"Before even viewing the film, it seemed that it would be yet another reproduction of a Man on Fire, Taken and so on. This was by far, not the case. Peppermint gives us a similar take on a parent overcoming great odds to either save their child, or seek revenge. However, at every corner, we are kept guessing about what her next move will be, where she will go, who she will or will not kill. Jennifer Garner's character, ""Riley North"" progressively becomes a badass ""Super Mom"" more and more throughout the entire film. When one's family is taken from them, either by death or kidnapping, they are left completely lost, horrified, and have to make a choice, do they take legal action, or take matters into their own hands?Riley North tried the route of going to the authorities, but when most of the law enforcement, lawyers, and judges are funded by the same criminal organization that you are trying to incriminate, things don't always go so well. Naturally this causes her to take matters into her own hands. After years of studying martial arts and studying the organization's tactics, Riley decided to take them out one by one, until she can eliminate the leader and get justice for her family.The film is both breathtaking and heartening. It is just about impossible not to sympathize, or at least empathize, with Riley. We have all either lost someone to relocation, to death, kidnapping, etc. Given this fact, almost anyone would be brought to tears at several points in the film, but hope and justice are also around every turn.Its originality and excitingly aggressive story, is what separates this film from others of the similar type. Peppermint surely changes the way we think about action movies. Many action films within the last 10 years, aside from possibly the last couple of years, have been a lot of shooting, blowing stuff up and saving a damsel in distress. Peppermint slashes those stereotypes, gives an original new tale, keeps you on the edge of your seat, and brings a tear to your eye, while also pumping you up! Many Hollywood films have attempted in recent years to bring about women empowerment and in some cases, have done an acceptable job. However, in many cases, these films simply take an original concept and just slap on a female lead instead of a male, or make a new concept that feels as though the only reason there is a female lead, is to empower women, while the plot is utterly lacking. Now, we have a new story, with something we can all relate to, similar qualities without being too much like a previous film to further relatability, a story that makes a lot of sense to include a female lead, a wonderful actress, and brings woman
empowerment to the viewers in a magnificent fashion. The empowerment aspect doesn't feel forced, but it is oh so powerful, and feels very real. It is great to see such a strong woman and a female empowered role, but it is even better to see it done right and to have an influential effect.Jon Vander Horn

How did she buy these weapons if in real-life they are illegal in California, they wouldn't be in the gun-store anyway. The craziest part of the movie is this idea that the cartel has these operations that somehow have their USA distributors becoming untouchable real life narcos .

It's an absolute travesty that the critics slammed this which I believe Weinstein and co had something to do with, due to Garner requesting a changing area to change without anyone present due to the #Metoo movement.She didn't do this because she's a diva, I believe she is humble and has class and is not like Gwyneth Paltrow at all, she did this for the men around hers benefit.So they wouldn't be paranoid she would make an allegation against her true or not. This film is better than the Accountant, I don't think the fact Jen's Character worked in a bank is a coincidence. I think this movie is a personal F you to Ben. I hope they get back together,you can tell she still loves him. Watch the film, its better than John Wick, Shooter, Bournes, It's slicker than any male led movie. I'm giving it a ten, if you've already voted lower consider your decision, look into your heart 🖤 and vote ten. You can tell Jen worked hard and really got hit and hurt making this movie. She trained for months,although she didn't need to due to the Kingdom and Electra a decade earlier and she hasn't aged at all and she has kids. F Weinstien, Cosby, the whole corrupt industry. In the sequel she should go after movie producers and tv hosts, maybe Ben could be in it with his accountant character and she gets with him after a Mr and Mrs Smith fight. Press play, Kiss your partner, share the popcorn!",Peppermint

665,fgumar,The writers and the director got wrong,7,11 June 2019,"The film went very well until the 85 minutes when the main character decides to lose focus and surrender to the drug traffickers. Her determination would prevent her from lowering her guard, even if it meant the life of an innocent child. From then on, only contradictions occurred: when the boss, who wanted to solve everything quickly, saw her walking towards him, decided to enter into a physical confrontation with the avenger. Never! A trafficker of that level would never have risked against such a well-trained assassin and worst, with that luck, but he would have shot himself in the head and ending the story. The writers and the director got wrong.",Peppermint
666,lisa66519,pretty unrealistic and kinda racist,3,13 September 2018,"Jennifer garner kills SO many people in this movie... she never wears gloves. most of the hispanics in the movie are criminals, gang members, or they break some sort of law. the movie fearmongers by making people think the courts are letting hispanic criminals run rampant and kill white families, and then getting off scott free. all this AND a ""white savior"" thrown in. this movie simultaneously did not meet my expectations and was a bit much.",Peppermint
667,dacicconi,Peppermint Rocks,9,28 December 2018,"I loved this movie staring Jennifer Garner. This is basically a superhero movie, except the anti-hero takes out the bad guys with ""extreme prejudice."" The professional reviewers or ""critics"" have their panties in a wad because the superhero is a woman. They have resorted to such phrases as cliched plot, lacks credibility, etc., but these same misogynistic dolts loved Batman, The Punisher, and the Die-hard series, movies where the suspension of belief is a Herculean effort.

It's an action, revenge, shoot 'em up film that is better than 90% of these types of movies. I loved the Schwarzenegger and Stallone films back in their hayday, but the storylines and plot holes are as big or bigger in those movies. Either the people rating this very low are planted reviews, or they are dudes who can't deal with a female lead in this kind of role.

I'm not a mom, but I sure would have only 2 options after that tradegy : either take a wrong path, take my own life (or the gangsters would have facilitate my end) or take revenge and possibly end up in jail. That mom had nothing more to lose. I think she chose well. That movie was a real pleasure to watch, it tickles my cells to the deepest. And the acting was good, too bad it wasn't long enough to know how she used that 5 year long span, who she met or what she learnt besides that boxing in Hong Kong. I don't think she learnt all those killing techniques by herself. Sequel maybe? . Also, good use of the SNS. I too would cheer her up because the corrupt justice system failed her.

The main caracter was chosen wisely! Right actors for the role. Stealing a car, braking woman's nose and few other things really take away a feeling of an angel from Jennifer. Reminds me a lot of Law Abidding citizen which is (my favorite movie of all). It is so hard to impress people with a good story these days.

715,katehirs,The worst movie of all time,1,25 September 2018,"Wow. ""Peppermint"" was so bad that I was in too much disbelief to even leave the movie theater. Did a 5th grader write this? 
Two different characters said: ""You're going to get dead."" 
All the Hispanics were drug-smuggling murderous gang members who were counting their blood money and praying to Santa Muerte in a downtown Piñata store. Suffering from various gun and knife wounds from mowing down hundreds of brown dudes in retaliation for killing your daughter on her birthday in slow motion? No problem. A brief rest, your ghastly daughter's encouragement, a staple gun and duct tape - and you're as good as new. After the defense lawyer tried to pay her off and the judge let the killers go and got her tased in the court room, she trained for 5 years ninja-style, learned cage fighting, and educated herself on American military grade weapons, then robbed the store that sold the said military grade weapons, and stored them in her van that she didn't even lock. Why didn't she lock the van? Because she had single-handedly scrubbed that neighborhood of crime so well that she didn't HAVE to keep the weapons behind locked doors. The sexy high-heeled FBI agent was able to just open the van door and see it chock full of weapons. The movie is named ""Peppermint"" because that was the flavor of the ice cream her daughter was eating when she was murdered. The husband had chocolate, but never mind. The title for the movie never came up again before or after this. The sassiest insult from our female lead character to the final boss is ""You hit like a girl."" The movie also attempted instilling some family values and comic relief when the main character mocked another rival mom for having gotten divorced, held a gun to her face, and she soiled herself. I could go on and on and on.
I can't even.",Peppermint
716,jrflair,Finally an action movie that isn't totally predictable.,9,27 September 2018,Jennifer Garner was excellent as the vigilante getting revenge for the slaughter of her husband and daughter. The story line is different from other vigilante movies in it doesn't spend a lot of time on the transition from wife/mother to incredible assassin.

723,butterflymom-74213,A vengful bloodbath,1,20 August 2019,"As enjoyable to many as this movie may be, It certainly does not represent reality, but fantasy. Jennifer Garners' character has a body double who does most of the work. Therefore her fans should know that she is used for her face and person. Otherwise this is just a movie extension of ALIAS. Justice in America does not always equal a death sentence and it certainly does not support vigilante action. If anyone could rip off firearms and go anywhere and shoot people, no one would be able to survive. In this story a Mother who lost her child and husband to a drive by drug vengeance shooting stays out of sight for 5 years then starts killing the 3 men and any other person involved, who shot her and her family. It is not realistic that she would be able to physically string up 3 men to a Farris Wheel. It is not realistic that she would still be alive after all of the wounds she incurred. She is not a professional killer either. Neither the DEA or Law Enforcement, nor the FBI could take these people out. Why would the viewer believe she could? Fantasy revenge is not mentally or emotionally healthy. Shame on whomever wrote this story as we really do not need to see more violence or bloodshed at the hands of the mentally ill. As our society grieves more and more over the loses of family, co-workers and friends, this is what we have being downloaded into our minds? Shame on Jennifer too. If I were her kid and saw Mom in this part I would be mortified. She looks like Jennifer Lopez playing a cop most of the time too. Still there was something about this movie that drew me. Maybe to give a more honest review and not suspend reality just to view a movie that was critically reviewed. I wanted to see what the fuss was about. It is not a movie I recommend or advise to show to people with emotional and mental issues or the immature minded. We simply can not return to a time of individual judgment. How this movie could be considered entertainment is beyond me.",Peppermint
724,laurawhitehouse-82445,Kick arse,9,23 March 2019,"I think this film was pretty good. No it won't win awards for I depth feeling; but for an entertaining action, kill everyone in sight sort of film it was pretty darn good. The story line is quite interesting (Law abiding citizen meets Narcos) easy to follow and keeps you watching.One of the main reason I enjoyed this film was the fact that they didn't focus to much on the fact that she was a women- yes the police said it was unlikely at the start because of her character, but that was realistic. Also I enjoyed the fact that she did all of this without having to use her sexuality to do it, which is normally a common theme in action film with women. Put on a tight dress and pretends to be a hooker to get into a bar sort of thing.
None of that- Mother/wife getting what she believes is justice for her family.I enjoyed it and would certainly watch it again.",Peppermint
725,sabreflier,Not bad - Critics always get it wrong,8,3 August 2019,"Was this as good as John Wick? Of course not. But for a short escape it's not bad. Jennifer Garner's acting was good as always. For all the morons saying the suburban mom turned vigilant wasn't logical - of course it wasn't. This is a vigilante escape-from-reality film. Enjoy it for what it was.I wanted to give a 7, but rated it at an 8 to bring up the average. The critic score is stupid - as they almost always are.For those of you rating this as a 1 or 2 - get a grip. You can't honestly have thought it was that bad. Think critically about what a 1 star film should look like! Worst of all time - hardly.

Many moments where both me and my partner said ""god what is going on now"" it just seems like a very rushed plot, like how many plot twists can they fit in the space of 10 minutes and it just seems a little all over the place.

Also Jennifer Garner fits perfectly. Cannot imagine anyone else doing this role now. This is now one of my favorite movies. The editing, soundtrack, the misplaced kind of humor in the dialogues, the leaving out the 'transformation' phase and some murders.. it makes a different movie from most. I watched it a second time and found out I missed some things. Also I like the side story that she keeps the place safe. She also doesn't hesitate ever to kill or hurt anyone, which isn't very feminine, so it was shocking in a fun way. Couldn't care less about John wick but this, this is something different. It's also rare that it gets so many positive comments on the youtube-trailers whereas I think a female lead would get bashed a lot more. I hope there will be a sequel but I'm afraid it cannot have the same effect. Why did this get a bad review by critics ? These people should be fired.",Peppermint

Love a movie when the good guy (ok, girl) turns bad to takeout the bad guys (but is still a good person inside, well, mostly). Some really great fight sequences that are actually more believable than some critics here think-always think a weaker looking person can take advantage of being underestimated by using quick aggressive action on a stronger opponent with too much machismo. This is a great flick for the action, but also for the human story (The Brave One stronger on the latter).",Peppermint

I also liked that the film didn't get bogged down in explaining the 5 years that she went missing. A lesser film would have spent 20-30 minutes going over her travels and training during those years.

I can't remember one original idea in the whole movie. The writer actually wrote a short movie about The Punisher, so you can't even say he didn't know what he was doing.There wasn't much to it other than scenes of the main character killing people and the police or the news reacting to it.

807,econ201mark,Routine vigilante thriller with a solid lead performance,4,11 September 2018,"I can sum up the positive aspect of this film with two words: Jennifer Garner. In what I am pretty sure is her first major action role since 2007's The Kingdom, Garner shows she is still a convincing action heroine. Within the rather narrow limits of the script, she gives a very solid performance. Anyone who is a fan of hers will not be disappointed with her work here.The film as a whole, however, is very disappointing, primarily because of the lack of intelligence or plausibility to the script. To take one of many, many examples, consider the courtroom scene which supplies the supposed necessity for Riley North (Garner) to become a vigilante in order to get vengeance for the murders of her husband and daughter. We are shown only a fragment of the scene, where the attorney for the killers ambushes Riley, during cross-examination, with the fact that she allegedly is taking medication that could interfere with her memory. Without allowing Riley to give a genuine response, the judge then immediately rules her identification of the murders inadmissible, and dismisses the charges against them. Meanwhile, the prosecutor sits silently.Supposedly, this scene shows that ""everyone was in on it,"" forcing Riley to take matters into her own hands. The problem is that the script doesn't even make the tiniest effort to show that this is the case. How does Riley know that the judge or the prosecutor were in on it? We are never shown. For that matter, how would even a drug dealer with a fair amount of cash sitting around arrange that any case involving his underlings would be dealt with this way? Did Garcia (Juan Pablo Raba) bribe every judge and prosecutor who might conceivably handle cases involving his people. The LA County DA's office alone has about 1000 attorneys. Then there are all of the city attorneys, not to mention prosecuutors in adjacent counties. That's a lot of bribes to spread around. Did they somehow arrange to have every case involving Garcia's organization handled by ""their"" prosecutors and judges? How?A further implausibility is the end of the courtroom scene, where after Riley's outburst, the judge immediately orders her confined to a mental hospital. To put it simply, the judge at a preliminary hearing does not have the authority to confine a witness, even an angry one, to a mental institution against her will. Even the most ridiculously bent judge would surely have the common sense not to blatantly exceed his authority like this, if for no other reason than that doing so would call unnecessary attention to him.This is all just in a single scene, about 2-3 minutes out of the movie's over 100 minute running time. I could go on and on, identifying implausibilities that riddle the script from beginning to end.The fact that this is a crime thriller does not require it to lack intelligence or plausibility. Plenty of filmmakers make intelligent crime thrillers; Michael Mann, David Ayers and Taylor Sheridan come to mind instantly. You can even have intelligent, believable vigilante thrillers, like The Brave One with Jodie Foster. But Pierre Morel and the rest of the filmmakers behind Peppermint apparently just didn't care.",Peppermint

This crazyness to put a woman in these type of roles its just a disaster. Griselda Blanco was a queen for the cartels but she used her brain and killed some very bad guys and husbands along the way, but not by pretending to be supergirl, she instead used her brain, lots of drug money to pay for the dirty work and just an evil mind , but Jennifer Garner doing the Van Damme thing, come on.",Peppermint

821,james_burnside_jr,The director should be black barred...,6,17 December 2018,"I have only gotten a quarter way into movie and I have to wonder who this director is? When you do this, it takes you out of the movie for obviously bad reasons. Jennifer Garner is doing a great job and she's the only one! But how it is shot, the side actors, everything else sucks. Let me explain, when you feel like you're watching a made for TV movie (the visuals, the lighting, the camera angles, the way you can see every bad angle of a person's face, the acting of everyone ok involved except Jennifer) you might as well turn on Netflix and veg out, hell Netflix is much better with this for most of it's productions. Would go with a lifetime made movie for this production. Visual producer and director need to find another line of work.",Peppermint
822,joanofarcxxi,Outstanding action film with a female lead that really delivers,8,20 November 2018,All I can say is: wow. Jennifer Garner deserves my absolute respect. Perhaps she needs a nomination. She was incredible in this film. A truly authentic portrait of a desperate and grieving mother with nothing else to loose. It's also nice to see a variety of ethnicities with relevant supporting roles in this flick. I am not a pro and I am not here to win any writing award. English is not even my native language. I am just an average female viewer like many others. The best critique I can offer: see this film for yourself. It is truly satisfying.,Peppermint
823,toninio_g,Better than John Wick,7,28 December 2018,"I just don't get it. John Wick has 68 Metascore and this movie - only 28?! It's a good thing I don't believe critics. Of course we can't talk about much realism in movies, where the protagonist alone eliminates dozens of people, but it was still more believable than John Wick.I liked the fact that they kept an eye for things like taking the gun when you kill somebody and use it, not having endless cartridges in the clips and other stuff like that. And yes, she killed a bunch of criminals, but at least she did it thanks to the element of surprise and stealth, not like most action movies - just going in and becoming immortal.I had low expectations but the movie surprised me pleasantly!",Peppermint

838,pj-82796,Garner was spectacular with a familiar storyline,7,5 December 2020,"Jennifer Garner did a phenomenal job acting with a common, rehash of a familiar script. There are many movies like this, but what made it better than most was her acting and much of the choreography. Not only did I like it, I will watch it again. Critics killed it for the most part, but I have learned over the years that sometimes it's just an viewpoint based less on knowledge and more on their opinion. That opinion doesn't always speak for most of us.",Peppermint

Gardner really fitted the part, it's as if she's being doing these type of movies for years. Move over Liam Neeson. I have give an 8 rating as it's worth one, would have got a 9 if it was on longer.

A woman who witness de dead of her husband and daughter seeks revenge. It reminds me of The Punisher (except the Punisher has more story, action
etcetera behind)Never the less it is a simple entertaining action movie.I hope there will be a sequel, because the question i have is, how en where did she learn in those 5 years of absence hand to hand combat? (there is a clip you see here fight in a cage match) but still and how did she know so much about weapons en tactical in that short time? Does she have a teacher? or does she just learn it from books or video?.
So that would be for me clearly about her 5 years absence before she came back to take down the criminals.",Peppermint

And have awaited her return to a action movies since Elektra. Unlike other reviewers, I do love her other movies, I don't think any actress could have played a more believeable character than she did in 13 Going on 30!!!! But Action is where I fell in love with her. This movie was amazing, I loved every second of it, I almost though at one point in the FBI office they were going to say they found out who she was, Sydney Bristow a former CIA Operative. This movie would have made such an amazing ""Left the agency to make a family and but now that you killed them, im using everything I learned to hunt you down"" movie. Would have been such an awesome twist. But still absolutely love the story of the movie. Most action movies fail to hold up and support an believeable story line and this one did, which made every minute even better.

Small people must unite against corrupt officials, corrupt police, corrupt judges, don't be afraid to unite to uphold justice.

It's just another generic revenge movie trying to be like Law abiding citizen, Punisher and John Wick but doesn't come close to any of these.

Is like the saw an entire different movie.Peppermint is one of those.I start watching it without much expectations however after the plot developed my mind changed. I feel like watching a Liam Neeson's at his best just in woman version. Hope that is not the reason for the poor ratings. It have been long time since I saw Jennifer Garner in a action movie. She play her character awesomely. The plot was good, couple of point left uncleared though like what specific trainings she got to turn a common mom in to a killing machine in 5 years but well which movie does. The fact of getting your entire family killed may be enough to get to it.As all movies this one is don't lack of flops but in general it worth watching it. Note, it is not a family or PG13 movie is a violent as any Taken trilogy movies.I see, unfortunately and sadly, it not perform extremely well in the box office, I guess because a woman action movies, so not sure we will see a sequel.

903,knowledgedealer,I feel ogligated as a functional member of society to write this,1,17 February 2019,"To be honest this is the most unenticing movie I have viewed in a long while. There is absolutely no pertinent plot or characther development at any point in the film. Also, the dialogue is lackluster and underlying theme of the film is the forgetable nature of the film.People have been saying that the critics reviews (which turn out to be lackluster for good reason) are not justified and the film is actually a diamond in the rough. Also, people say that these critical reviews are due to a female playing a ""strong lead role"", this is total misunderstanding by the untrained observer. What is going on is the confusion of the attribute of vengence and doing what you deem is just with essence of a strong lead role.My intial reaction to this film is the traditional idea, of nothing new under the sun. Female protagonist, men are wimps, the system failed so the omnipotent mind of a single female will take it upon herself to reconstruct the nature of what justice is then to singlehandedly take on a bloodthristy criminal organization (which I mind you is filled with supposedly tough men or atleast the idea of it) and comes out on top.This is another vapid attempt at reconstructing the dynamic of what a film about what justice should be and how it should be carried out (this is no different from mad max, expect one is more honest in the delivery than the other), that once again during its last dying breath fails to acheive anything credible, expires and then falls victim to irrelevency.",Peppermint

Sad part about it is most of it could and probably is true with crooked money hungry cops and crooked judges. We absolutely loved it from beginning to end. We were surprised throughout the whole movie.",Peppermint
