0,MartinHafer,Vague and without clear answers....just like real life.,8,15 February 2010,"I am giving this movie an 8 because it is so well made, however, it is also a rather unpleasant film at times and will probably leave many quite cold. After all, if you need to have a film with certainty, a clear ending or a story that is formulaic, this film is NOT for you. In fact, there are some in particular who would enjoy the film most. Jews or Christians familiar with the story of Job would definitely have a huge advantage. Likewise, someone who likes films that are NOT Hollywood-like will also like the film. You don't exactly have to love the films Ingmar Bergman...but it sure would help! The film is about the life of a rather bland but decent Jewish man, Larry, who is living in the late 1960s. One by one, things in his life begin to fall apart--his wife is leaving him, his children are alienated, he is worried about losing his job, etc. and for the first time, Larry has no answers and begins to look for some explanation about life. However, throughout the film, he keeps finding that there are NO ANSWERS!! Again and again, Larry tries, in vain, to get a handle on his life...and then abruptly it all ends...much like real life.The film is expertly crafted and acted. It's all about the meaningless of life or at least the fact that while you are living you cannot make sense of it. Not something many would like to think about, but an interesting religious and philosophical film--and makes you ask yourself a lot of questions.By the way, if you aren't familiar with Judaism or Yiddish, try watching the special feature ""Hebrew and Yiddish for Goys""--a pop-up video-like short which explains what words throughout the film actually mean to a Gentile.",A Serious Man
1,SnoopyStyle,Very tiring to watch as he gets pushed around,6,6 January 2014,"It's 1967 Bloomington, Minnesota. Larry Gopnik is a meek physics professor. His kids are annoying brats. His brother Arthur (Richard Kind) is an unwelcome house guest. His wife Judith wants a divorce. His student is constantly pestering him.The Coen brothers are skilled filmmakers. But not everything they do is always to my taste. And this movie doesn't speak to me. I'm not Jewish. I don't understand this character. I wonder if we're suppose to laugh at the guy. I'm certain not going to laugh with him. His patheticness is incredibly tiring. It's a dark comedy with few laughs. Mostly it left me scratching my head. I found watching this a rather frustrating experience as he is assailed on all sides. Everybody has a sad sheen of annoyed anger. It is beautifully shot, and expertly filmed. I just don't get this guy.",A Serious Man
2,Hitchcoc,Excellent but Not for Everyone,9,26 May 2010,"I really became involved in this film. Like so many Coen characters, the ones in this film are outrageous. The ""Serious"" man is caught in the middle of all of them. However, they live according to the prelates of Judaism (an almost comedic form) and it lashes out at every aspect of the man's life. He is a nice man (boring though he may be) and he really does nothing wrong. it is this lack of true passion that pulls him down, time after time. He seeks out help, but everyone talks in monologues. There is no connecting with his problems. He is suffering from some malady. His children are awful. His wife is a mindless creep. But he keeps on being the nice guy, catering to their every whim. I guess the cliché that best fits is ""No good act goes unpunished."" Everyman has the crap kicked out of him.",A Serious Man
3,Horst_In_Translation,Goys and monsters - a (dark) comedy masterpiece,10,7 October 2019,"""A Serious Man"" is an American 105-minute movie that premiered back in 2009, so this one has its 10th anniversary this year actually. I think I watched it three times so far, once right after its initial release, then again at some point later on and now on the occasion of a celebration of Jewish cinema for a third time. And it got better for me with each watch. First time I did not like it much, second time I enjoyed it and now in 2019 I really loved it. Maybe this is a film that you will appreciate more when getting older and not in your early/mid20s I don't know. However, I am really glad it grew on me this much. This is already the third film by the Coen Brothers that I give a perfect 10 of 10. The other two would be True Grit and Inside Llewyn Davis. These are probably not the films that you immediately associate with the Oscar-winning filmmaking duo in the face of The Big Lebowski, No Country for Old Men and Fargo, but you should check them out if you haven't already. With the Coen Brothers, you really always get high quality, especially if they are directing too, not just in charge of the script. So with these high ratings, it is probably fair to say that they are my number 1 filmmaking favorites now.Okay lets go a bit into detail now about this movie in particular. The cast really does not include many famous actors, actually some of them have never been in a film before or after that again. But this does not go against the movie at all quality-wise. It is a huge success. The exception is maybe Michael Stuhlbarg, who plays the central character, but even he is not a superstar or so and was even less famous before this film. With his portrayal here, he also reached his biggest career milestone so far, a Golden Globe nomination. Very deserving. He is really good in here and even if this is like most Coens' stuff a film that is more about the script, action and characters than about individual performances, he surely gives a strong portrayal and there are some moments he has that are difficult to forget. A great example for that is when he moves his head from the side into the room and how there is clear panic on his face. I think it was after his car accident. But it is these individual shots and moments and characters too that are so memorable in this Coen film, just like they are in other Coen films. As for the characters, just take the one who has no idea how the earphones are working. Or the woman who enters his room making the weirdest noises. Or the two other rabbis (one of them played by Big Bang Theory's Simon Helberg). And I could probably list at least five other characters who fit such a description. Not portrayed by a big-name actors, no impact on the story really, just one scene, but still incredibly memorable and had my eyes glued to the screen. Nobody does that as good as the Coens. Oh yeah, another I have to mention is the (racist?) neighbor who is ready to beat up the Asian father immediately if asked for it. I laughed a lot more in that scene than I should have.Now I mentioned the Jewery aspect earlier already, but let's get back to this again here. I am not sure if non-Jewish filmmakers would have gotten away with all that, but how can Jewish viewers say they are offended if this work comes from a duo of Jews. Major focus on the religion on many occasions, also minor focus on other occasions. For example when Stuhlbarg's character says he only cares for the neighbors on one side and the ""hot"" neighbor asks if he is talking about the goys on the other side. Or of course the Bar Mitzvah part. Or the rabbis. And so on. This has to be the best funniest Jewish comedy film ever made. I am glad it got the Coens a screenplay nomination and also even a Best Picture nomination at the Oscars. I laughed so hard in these between 1.5 and 2 hours and it's been a while since I laughed so hard at a film. I mentioned some reasons already, the characters are all so funny, also in their over-the-topness and the Coens are still getting away with it because they are such excellent writers. Same for the dream sequences. There are several. This has been done really so often in the past and sometimes it just feels like filler material, but not so here. These add a lot. Aside from that, I also liked the music. I am not particularly speaking about the soundtrack, but about the two songs used here, one very old traditional Jewish tune and Jefferson Airplane's ""Somebody to Love"". Now Tarantino is always referenced as the master when it comes to music choices and soundtracks, but with that (and Inside Llewyn Davis), the Coens prove that they are not far behind. Also these two songs make a lot of sense in the context of the film, when on one occasion even the names of the Jefferson Airplane band members are mentioned. And the Jewish song's inclusion is self-explanatory of course.Okay what else can I say about this marvellous movie? Let me think. It's already been a week and I didn't find the time so far to review this film, but I definitely wanted to go for it, so here goes. Next time I try to be quicker. I was also happy to see how full the theater was for this showing really. The movie totally deserves it and I can see that it does not really have a lot of mass appeal, so the quantity of viewers there makes me even happier. Oh yeah, as for all the characters, maybe one reason why we like the film is because also a bit the factor that even if the characters are super colorful and interesting and we wonder what happens next to them, we sure don't want to be them. Everybody is in a mess at some point. If we are talking about gambling issues, failed tests that are crucial for the future, people dying in car accidents, people dying out of nowhere at a lawyer's office, children running from violent bullies, female characters losing their loved ones, major health issues and so on. And these factors do not even include all the ghastly stuff that happens to Stuhlbarg's central character, which is a lot too. Nobody gets away unharmed. Well almost nobody, maybe the woman who likes naked sunbathing, if we really need to name somebody. Still, she is (just like the protagonist) not in a happy marriage, maybe a drug addict, so yeah no she does not fit the description either, perhaps the lawyer played by Adam Arkin. Or really the rabbis. It is very tough for me to find something I did not like about this film. There really isn't anything. If there are scenes that did not do too much for me, they are still okay, just not as good as everything else. I also loved for example how the Coens do not take themselves seriously at all despite somehow tricking everybody into thinking they do when there is this scene with the strange signs on the teeth and in the end, it just means nothing. At least to Stuhlbarg's character.Maybe another scene that did not do too much for me is the lengthy introduction taking places millennia earlier. Is he a dybbuk or not? Can you really stab him, maybe kill him if you have the suspicion he is a demon? I must say I could have done without this sequence, but it still makes total sense and you can connect many metaphors, symbolisms and parallels from it to what happens later on. Is anybody really doomed? I mean the moment the central character (the serious man) gives in to a morally (more than) questionable act and is about to accept the money to pay for his brother's legal fees, that is the moment when real tragedy is about to ensue, when he gets the call from his doctor. And at the same time we see the man's son in the face of the storm where it really does not matter anymore to whom he owes money or not. The storm is the bad news come to life. So he will probably get a cancer diagnosis, but it is not necessarily a negative ending because the storm will be over at some point and so perhaps the cancer will also be cured and vanish. Okay, I don't wanna go into detail about this much more because it is not even officially stated he has cancer, even if it is something grave obviously. Still, it was a truly interesting way to end the film, very creative too and not many filmmakers these days can come up with endings like these. It is so nice to have filmmakers who do not feel the need to have the audience leave the theater in the happiest manner and sacrifice all authenticity and realism for that. No, the Coens do their own thing (No Country for Old Men is another prime example) and that is exactly how it should be. I could write another 10,000 words about this wonderful movie and I certainly want to watch it again at some point and that statement alone is already a sign of quality coming from me because I don't do that often at all, even with films I like. I am sure no matter how many times you watch this one, you will always discover something new again. Finally, I would also like to mention Fred Melamed who was just outstanding and such a hilarious character and wow the revelation about the letters, you will also get surprised here many times. And think again when you hear about the subject of demons, punishment and (religious) karma. This film is a lot deeper than it may seem at first sight. Do not mistake it for meaningless fun, only because comedy here is the dominating genre. Or one individual shot that was also magnificent is the gigantic green board at the university with all the stuff written on there. How can this be funny? Well, with the right approach and camera work, it is totally hilarious. Exaggerations can make for the greatest comedy when done right. Okay, I think that will be really all then. Even if I wrote another five paragraphs, you could not grasp the greatness of this film the way you would when you are watching it yourself. So do it! What are you waiting for? One of 2009's very finest, not just from America, but in general. Highly, highly recommended.",A Serious Man
4,Prismark10,But seriously,5,15 April 2016,"After the dark intensity of No Country for Old Men, the Coen Brothers decide to make a loosely structured, black comedy that hark back to their Jewish roots.The film opens in Yiddish about a man who returns home and tells his wife a story of how a old man helped him out. When his wife hears the name of the old man she gasps and tells her husband that the man died several years earlier and they have been cursed.We then move to 1967, Larry Gopnik, a physics professor at a Midwestern university has failed a Korean student who in turn has left an envelope with money behind for the professor as a bribe. Larry is also hoping to get tenure but has recently been subjected to a letter writing campaign spelling out his unsuitability for the job.At home his wife Judith tells him that she is leaving him and fallen in love with the pompous and older Sy Ableman (who is actually the serious man described in the movie.) Before long Larry is living at a cheap motel with his feckless brother Arthur who previously slept on the couch at the family home as Sy Ableman moves into his home.Larry's son Danny who is a few weeks away from his Bar Mitzvah is interested only in getting a good TV reception, dope and listening to music. He is racking up bills by ordering records through mail order schemes. His daughter Sarah is taking money from his wallet in order to save up for a nose job.Before long Larry needs to see a divorce lawyer which is also costing him money and takes advice from various Rabbis who are well meaning but are of little help.Larry is wondering why he is being tasked? Larry is trapped as his life is collapsing around him and getting jiggy with a foxy neighbour does not help.This is a quirky film. I did not completely understand it. Critics have compared Larry's fate to that of Job. However I presume this is the Job of the Talmud and not the Old Testament.I just found it a nice film but insubstantial and unfocused. Larry should had exposed Sy as a pompous, bitter, hypercritical sleaze bag along with his wife and he would had been in a better state.The film ends rather suddenly as a storm approaches and Larry gets an urgent phone call from his doctor.",A Serious Man
5,claudio_carvalho,"Boring, Annoying and Overrated Flick without Conclusion",3,5 June 2010,"The suburban Jewish Professor Lawrence 'Larry' Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) is facing problems is his life: his wife has just asked the divorce; one Korean student has tried to bribe him to improve his grade; he crashed his car on the road; his next door neighbor has trespassed his lawn; his sick brother moved to his house disturbing his family. Larry unsuccessfully seeks the rabbis of his community to get answers to his problems.First of all, I am not a fan of the work of the pretentious Ethan and Joel Coen. I am not religious but the comparison with the ""Book of Job"" is absurd. ""A Serious Man"" is a boring, annoying and overrated flick without conclusion and one if their worst movies. They should watch European films to learn how to make an intelligent end open to interpretations since this movie has actually lack of end. The Prologue is totally disconnected from the plot. The lead character is a complete douche bag cuckold and not a serious man as proposed in the title; the supposed black humor is not funny and never works; and most of the dialogs inserts Jewish words that can not be understood by those like me that are not familiarized with the Jewish culture and religion. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Um Homem Sério"" (""A Serious Man"")",A Serious Man
6,kosmasp,A serious Review,7,24 August 2010,"And no I'm not saying that this is serious as opposed to ... No this is meant as a joke/reference to the title. But as with the movie, any review of this will divide people. You'll either be put in the fan corner or in the ""not get it"" corner, depending on your likes and of course what the reader likes.While this intro might seem to have nothing to do with the movie, the same could be said about the intro to the movie. It took me a while to deal with that. It seems so completely different, that I was worried I was in the wrong cinema, watching a different movie, than I thought I would. But since I didn't know the movie that was playing, I relaxed after a couple of minutes.And while this intro (to the movie), would work greatly as a standalone short (it really is freaky) it seems to be as far removed from the rest of it, as is possible. That and the fact, that our ""hero"" is rather passive were a bit of a drag, while watching. But in hindsight, I have to admit, that the movie started to grow on me. Something Fargo never achieved (with me), this movie could. And I haven't even mentioned the great cinematography or the very good music (until now that is)",A Serious Man
7,gavin6942,Where the Point of the Film is Not the Plot,7,21 February 2010,"Professor Larry Gopnik's marriage is falling apart, and his family in general seems to be crumbling. Beyond that, his job is uncertain and he receives a very odd bribe from a student... what does it all mean? With a cast of characters not taken from the Coens' regular playbook, this and more is examined.I found this film to be not very satisfying, at least not on the first viewing -- it has an uninteresting plot and no characters to care about. Everyone is either bland or malicious. But the secret to appreciating this movie is not to follow the plot, as it won't take you anywhere, but to open yourself up to wonder. One character sums up the film best when he says, ""accept the mystery"".The opening scene with the dybbuk sets the stage for the entire film's premise, that uncertainty is part of life. If you're expecting to see these characters again, you're wasting your time. The reason question is: is the man really a dybbuk? The husband and wife argue and there is no firm conclusion... even in the credits, he is listed as ""dybbuk?""Uncertainty comes into play again and again with questions being raised but not answered, or left vague enough that they could be taken multiple ways. The professor teaches a class on Schroedinger's cat, who is simultaneously alive and dead... it makes no sense, but the math confirms it as true. Even the professor says he doesn't really get it, which sums up his life: situations that are complicated and hard to fathom. We are shown how God can be mysterious with the ""goy's teeth"" story... and again and again and again.This is actually at least the second Coen Brothers film that mentions the ""uncertainty principle"". In ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" the lawyer wants to make it part of his defense strategy, because ""Sometimes, the more you look, the less you really know."" (Others have tied ""Barton Fink"" into this category, too.) I do recommend you see this film, but if you do, either keep your mind open to a non-linear way of watching a film, or watch it a second time, where it should fit together more. And, pay attention to detail. From the very beginning, you'll be fed clues, such as the quotation from French Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaki, better known as Rashi, at the film's opening: ""Accept with simplicity everything that happens to you""",A Serious Man
8,jboothmillard,A Serious Man,5,27 January 2014,"I saw the poster and DVD cover for this film, I perhaps got confused with the Colin Firth film A Single Man a couple of times because of the lead character having glasses and a similar title, but once I distinguished which was which I was interested in seeing this one as well, from writer/director brothers Joel and Ethan Coen (Fargo, No Country for Old Men, True Grit). Basically, set in 1967, in Bloomington, Minnesota, Larry Gopnik (Golden Globe nominated Michael Stuhlbarg) is a serious man, he is a Jewish physics lecturer, but he is finding his life falling apart, his daughter Sarah (Jessica McManus) is saving up for a nose job and stealing from him to pay for it, his son Danny (Aaron Wolff) is a pothead who only wants him round to fix the TV aerial, the son gets stoned at his own bar-mitzvah, and Uncle Arthur (Richard Kind) is unwelcome house guest. Larry's wife Judith 'Judy' (Sari Lennick) wants a divorce, so he and Arthur end up in a motel, and she has her lover Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed) move in, but he dies and the brothers remain where they are, and of course all the lawyers' bills mount for Arthur for the divorce. With other depressing things going on, such as court appearances, problems with students and exam marking and of course his mental state reaching breaking point he consults Rabbi Scott (Simon Helberg) and Rabbi Nachtner (George Wyner), and after many events, by the end of the film everything goes back to at least some form of normality. Also starring Adam Arkin as Divorce Lawyer, Amy Landecker as Mrs. Samsky, Alan Mandell as Rabbi Marshak, Fyvush Finkel as Dybbuk and Allen Lewis Rickman as Shtetl Husband. To be absolutely honest, I couldn't follow everything that was going on during this film, I understood the concept and premise behind it, and I did laugh at the right moments, including the dark humoured moments, and of course the performances, direction and writing are all good, but I don't think it's the sort of film I would see more than once, or maybe I would need to again, but it was an alright black comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Writing, Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay. Worth watching!",A Serious Man
9,moonspinner55,Expressions of life,6,11 September 2016,"Misfortunes befall a Jewish physics professor in 1967 Minnesota: his wife is dating a family friend and wants a divorce, his two teenage children are self-centered and unsympathetic, his brother (living with the family) is a nuisance and an embarrassment, one of his students has attempted to bribe him for a better grade...even his neighbors--animal-killing Goyum!--are giving him a rough time. Richly-textured dark comedy by the sometimes-inscrutable Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan, who teamed on the writing, producing and directing, begins with a strange, amusing Yiddish prologue in pre-WWII Eastern Europe that sets the tone for the quizzical, deadpan-eccentric situations that follow. In the lead, Michael Stuhlbarg initially projects a wonderful, grounded screen presence, a combination of a logical perspective and a dryly incredulous resolve; however, the Coens come to rely too much on Stuhlbarg's nebbish qualities, such as his unwavering patience in the midst of outlandish circumstances. Stuhlbarg's crinkled, happy/sad eyes and his nervous, tightly-stretched little smiles also remind one too much of a younger Robin Williams, and the performance begins to look like an impersonation. The art direction and set design is a dream, showcasing the Coens penchant for brilliant scene-composition and execution, but their tale--an ironic tragicomedy about morals and fate and the ""expressions of life""--won't be to everyone's taste. Ultimately, the film offers a handful of audacious moments in search of a masterwork. **1/2 from ****",A Serious Man
10,blanche-2,Another wonderful Coen film,8,2 April 2016,"""A Serious Man"" from 2009 is another example of the Coen Brothers' art, humor, and unique perception of the world. I imagine if I were Jewish, I would have loved it even more, but you don't have to be to enjoy the film. If you're a Coen Brothers fan, this is for you.The film starts back in the old country, when a man tells his wife that he ran into someone while outside, and she says, ""we're cursed."" Why? Because the man is dead and has been for three years. Then he (Fyvush Finkel) appears at the door. She refers to him as a dybbuk, a malicious spirit, and stabs him. He's bleeding, but he leaves, still speaking Yiddish.I guess they were ancestors of the main character, the beleaguered Larry Gopnik (Michael Stulbarg), a mathematics teacher in the midwest in the '60s. Larry is the modern version of Job. He's up for tenure, but someone is writing anonymous letters - negative ones -- about him to the board, though he's assured ""we're not basing our decision on them."" In the meantime, he receives numerous calls from Dick Dutton of the Columbia Record Club dunning him for money. Except he never joined.A Korean student Larry flunked may or may not have bribed him - there is money in an envelope in the desk. Later the boy's father comes to threaten to sue him for defamation if he flunks his son. ""So are you saying he did bribe me?"" Larry asks. ""That's defamation,"" the boy's father says.Then his wife Judith (Sari Lennick) tells him she wants a divorce to marry Sy Abelman (Fred Melamed). Sy is a warm man, who embraces Larry, takes his hand, and speaks to him sincerely. Except it seems that all Sy and everybody else want to do is screw him. When Sy, Larry, and Judith meet to discuss the situation, they suggest he move out and stay at the Jolly Roger motel. It's assumed his brother Arthur (Richard Kind) who sleeps on their couch will go with him. Arthur's in trouble for gambling and later, something else.Larry's pot-smoking son (Aaron Wolff) is preparing for his bar mitzvah. While Larry is meeting with his attorney (Adam Arkin), his son calls to say F-Troop is fuzzy on the TV.It's suggested that Larry see a rabbi - he sees two out of the three he's supposed to see. One compares life to the parking lot and the other tells him the story of the goy's teeth. The third one - well, you'll see. Through the film, the question is, why do bad things happen in the world when God, the Great Controller, is good? It makes us put everything in perspective, particularly when Arthur has a nervous breakdown by the motel's empty pool, asking why God has given him nothing and Larry has kids and a job. Is God being unjust? Is suffering a punishment or does it ""rescue the afflicted from their affliction"" and make them more amenable to revelation - ""open their ears?"" The thing is, as demonstrated here, life is uncertain - and as we see at the end, we just never really know minute to minute what's going to happen next.Michael Stuhlbarg is fantastic as poor Larry, at first accepting calamities rather passively and staying calm, and then giving in to flipping out and shedding tears. The casting is pretty much perfect all the way through.I love the Coen Brothers. For dark comedy, I love Fargo, and for their serious side, I love No Country for Old Men. Any theme they take on, they run with it in their own way. How many people can find comedy in the story of Job, and ask a philosophical question at the same time?",A Serious Man
11,Quinoa1984,"""I didn't do... anything!"" exactly",10,3 October 2009,"The Coen Brothers give to its frazzled protagonist Larry Gopnick a line a few times during the course of A Serious Man, ""I didn't do anything!"" that is more than just an homage to Franz Kafka - it's ripping him off basically. This is not to say Larry is quite in the same predicament of Joseph K. Then again, I wonder if Larry would prefer no explanation to the if-it-wasn't-for-bad-luck-I-would-have-no-luck status over the kinds he gets to his troubles. He has a divorce pending and his wife leaving with Sy Ableman (seriously, Sy Ableman!), he has a South Korean student who may be simultaneously bribing him and suing him for defamation, he has a brother who has a cyst/no job/gambling troubles, two kids who more or less are just typically dysfunctional teens (the boy on his way to be Bar Mitzvah and smoking enough dope to acknowledge more than once that it's 1967), and his sexual repression is practically taunted by the foxy Jewish woman next door who sunbathes nude. And what does God have to say about this? Oh, don't get him started on trips to the Rabbi - frankly, he'd have better luck with Anton Chigurh.A Serious Man is a movie to take seriously as art, but at the same time the Coens aren't above pulling out their usual all-stops to make this a hilariously weird and awkward movie. Perhaps a better way to compare is that it's like if Curb Your Enthusiasm starred an average shmo who doesn't have quite the sense of humor of Larry David (and, perhaps, is even cursed by his bloodline via the opening scene in the movie... or maybe not, I'll get to that in a moment), and who keeps getting s*** on from all directions (not coincidentally perhaps Richard Kind appears in both show and movie). It's such a funny movie that I have to think back to Big Lebowski and O'Brother Where Art Thou to remember when I laughed so hard. Maybe its the predilection for Jewish jokes that sting so, or maybe its the originality with the storytelling. As far as a black-as-Jewish-death comedy, it works completely.As for being a masterpiece of a film... I'm still not completely sure. Sometimes the Coens' movies are instant classics (No Country for Old Men, Blood Simple), and others take a little while to grow on a viewer (i.e. Miller's Crossing, even Big Lebowski was a grower and not a shower for me). A Serious Man may fall in the latter category; it's such a personal film, maybe more than anyone done before if only for the time and place and particulars of the characters in a Jewish-suburb of Minnesota, and its such an oddity in their catalog of work. Watching Larry on this existential odyssey of ""WTF"" nears Bergman proportions - there's even a scene where a character's death affects a woman in much the same way as the father Ekdahl's death in Fanny & Alexander - where religion is tested to the fullest and most harrowing of emotional schemes. Where is God when Larry needs him? Everywhere? Nowhere? Screw Larry, he didn't pay his (son's) Columbia Records account! But for all that succeeds in A Serious Man, such as a completely masterful sequence (a contender for my single favorite sequence of any movie this year) where a Rabbi describes a harrowing and pointless and uproarious story of a dentist and a Goy's teeth, or when Larry's son is stoned out of his mind when reading the Torah at his Bar Mitzvah (a first in cinema history, combining marijuana, Roger Deakins' use of a lens-baby, and Hebrew), and its creative characterizations and shocking nightmare scenes, it's an unsettling film, and not always in the best ways. It's a film that, as one could argue in their past films, is at war with if not the audience directly then with audience expectations. We might expect A Serious Man to just be about this man's downward spiral in his life, but what then to make of that (cool) opening scene all in Yiddish and (admitted by Joel Coen) to not really have a whole lot to do directly with the rest of the movie, or, for that matter, the end of the movie which just... ends.As far as 'f***-you's' to audiences go, it certainly is funny and startling in comparison with No Country for Old Men (almost like the Coens are saying 'yeah, knock this one this time, we *dare* you!), and if I get an f-you from filmmakers I'm glad it comes from them. But... you will either need more than a viewing for it to sink in, or you'll curse the day you decided to walk in the theater or rent it. Not much of a middle ground. Then again, I wouldn't want it any other way in this case. And hey, it's got Jefferson Airplane quoted by a Yoda-Rabbi, that scores points right there! 9.5/10",A Serious Man

I have a love hate relationship with the Cohens with my take on their films being I like every other one. The ones I don't like I find odd for no good reason except contrariness. I think this is one of the odd ones. I think it fits perfectly into the stage work they have been doing here in New York which make me go WTF.Not my cup of tea.,A Serious Man

To require a familiarity with Schroedinger's Cat, or the Book of Job, or Jewish culture may be too much for the average viewer.But, this is the movie you get to make after you have won an Oscar (No Country For Old Men); a labor of love, not something you make to fill the seat, although that can be good, too. But, refer back to the knowledge you need to bring with you to see it is not likely.All that being said, you cannot dismiss this film, if for no other reason that it was a contender for two Oscars.Michael Stuhlbarg is outstanding as Larry, who world is turned upside down, and things happening all around him that cannot be explained. You don't know at times what is real and what is dreams, but it doesn't really matter as it all has a meaning.Don't ask God why this is happening to you, just deal with it.There are some really hilarious scenes in the movie.

Depressing, irritating, tedious, boring. Started off interestingly enough, but then the misery started to get piled on. Pretty soon it became evident that there was no upside to the story. You end up hating every single character in the movie, especially the lead character who is the ultimate pushover. I kept hoping that he would suddenly snap and either start telling all the people that were pushing him around to f*k off, or go postal and turn into an action movie. Sadly, no such luck.No Country for Old Men is one of my favourite movies, and that didn't have a typically happy ending, so it wasn't the lack of a happy ending that put me off this. Must have been the tedium in getting to the ending, and all the loathsome characters involved.Having won the Oscar for No Country for Old Men I guess the Coens are allowed to experiment and release any kind of crap they like.

A mathematics professor who's made a living from finding meaning in formulas, he's not equipped to deal with the sh*tstorm of random bad luck the universe seems intent on heaping on him all at once. He tries to turn to his religion, which proves to be no help at all, and ultimately finds things sorting themselves out until a last-minute phone call delivers the the ultimate morbid punch line to both him and the audience.Set in the 1960s, ""A Serious Man"" looks fantastic in its period detail, and it avoids the grotesque caricature that harpoons so many of the Coens' other films. Yet it doesn't entirely escape the cold formality that also can make their films hard to warm to. It's formally nearly flawless, but also rather bloodless.Still, it's certainly worth a view, and I would put it in the same league as other Coen films like ""No Country...."", ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" and ""Fargo"" rather than their dismal ones like ""Burn After Reading"" and ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""

18,ferguson-6,I Didn't Do Anything!,8,11 October 2009,"Greetings again from the darkness. For me, any new Coen Brothers film is like the biggest Christmas present ... the fun is in the unwrapping. And WOW, does this one have many layers of wrapping paper! Seemingly based on the Book of Job, this is by far the most personal and intimate film in the Coen catalog. Probably has a good deal of autobiographical details from their childhood, though of course, there is much much more. First warning - there is massive Jewish stuff in this one. Not the overwhelming religious part and not the punchline part ... it is the real life details.Can't give much away on this one but there are no shortage of fascinating scenes and images to dissect and discuss. Can our actions bring the wrath of God or as the quote suggests, should we just accept with simplicity the happenings in our life? Ethan and Joel do a superb job of casting fine actors that we recognize, yet lack stardom. There is no Javier Bardem here. Instead Michael Stuhlburg is spot on as the everyman trying to do the right things in life, yet carries a huge burden when things begin to go wrong ... and it just won't stop.One of my favorite characters in the film is Sy Abelman, played with the warmest panache by Fred Melamed. The way he ""comforts"" Gropnik (Stuhlberg) is sincere, yet creepy and annoying. Richard Kind is quite different as the Uncle who is always in the bathroom and George Wyner is the absolute worst story telling Rabbi in history.While the beginning/prologue is like a short film until itself, the dots are pretty easy to connect. And the best part is seeing the great Fyvush Finkel on screen again. He was a can't miss on the series Boston Public - and is even better here.This one combines religion, family life, relationships, lust, teenage rebellion, grown-up responsibility and just about any other topic you'd like to throw in. In the hands of lesser filmmakers, this one would be a disaster. In the able hands of the Coen Brothers and cinematographer Roger Deakins, it is a near masterpiece.",A Serious Man
19,Wuchakk,When a group of drug-addled hippies are closer to the truth than quantum electrodynamics or ancient Hebraic scholarship,6,30 April 2017,"Released in 2009 and written & directed by the Coen brothers, ""A Serious Man"" is a black comedy/drama/satire about a passive Minneapolis physics professor (Michael Stuhlbarg) in 1967 who faces a series of tragedies and desperately seeks the answers 'Why?' Sari Lennick plays his unfaithful wife and Fred Melamed (who looks like Francis Ford Coppola) her lover. Richard Kind appears as the eccentric (maybe genius) uncle while Aaron Wolff & Jessica McManus play the kids. Amy Landecker is on hand as a sexpot neighbor. Simon Helberg (from The Big Bang Theory) has a small role as an assistant rabbi. There's a prologue that was shot in the Czech Republic which the Coens say has no link to the rest of the movie. Really? It struck me as rather tedious and, if it has no connection to the story, why is it there? Actually, I didn't find the entire first half of the film very entertaining and the protagonist's ultra-passivism started to become exasperating, but around the halfway point things began to click and I found myself consistently amused till the end.Freely borrowing from the awesome book of Job, this movie will obviously play better to Jewish and Christian audiences; perhaps also other spiritual seekers. It addresses the deep questions of life and the inherent challenges of the human condition (trapped in a physical shell in a fallen world while yearning for the perfect and divine) with a good sense of satirical humor. The song ""Somebody to Love"" by Jefferson Airplane is a focal point and supposedly holds the non-answers:""When the truth is found to be lies; And all the joy within you dies. Don't you want somebody to love? Don't you need somebody to love? Wouldn't you love somebody to love? You better find somebody to love."" There are anachronistic references to two albums: Santana's Abraxas and Creedence Clearwater Revival's Cosmo's Factory, which weren't released until 1970, three years after the events in the film. The movie runs 106 minutes and was shot in the Minneapolis, Minnesota, area (e.g. the suburban scenes were filmed in Bloomington), including St. Louis Park, where I spent my childhood.

20,gradyharp,You gotta love the Coen Brothers...,7,12 February 2010,"Ethan and Joel Coen continue to make films that make the audience scratch their heads even while they are laughing in response to situations and dialogue they don't clearly understand. That is part of the beauty of the Coen brothers' films. They are conundrums, perhaps, but highly skilled and polished ones. They are an acquired taste. A SERIOUS MAN has a fascinating overture - a dark drama in Yiddish about a curse, a dybbuk ('In Jewish folklore, a disembodied human spirit that must wander restlessly, burdened by former sins, until it inhabits the body of a living person') and then plops us down in Minneapolis in a Jewish neighborhood inhabited by a strange group of folk - Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) who copes with the inanities of teaching Physics while coping with a venomous Korean student unhappy with his failing grade, an inane tenure committee, a son readying himself for Bar MItzvah while running from his dope dealer, a redneck neighbor on one side and a vamp on the other side of his home that is being torn apart by a wife wanting a Jewish style divorce to marry Larry's best friend and a brother who is a live-in raunch, among other distractions. Somehow winding through these 'curses' we get to know the real serious man and all the foibles that mark life among these weird characters. It is very funny at times, goes on a bit long at others, but the film is echt-Coen, and for most that is probably enough. They do have their style! Grady Harp",A Serious Man
21,zetes,"Something to laugh at while you're watching, and something to ponder when you're done",9,18 October 2009,"A strange comedy from the Coen Brothers - of course that's the kind of comedy they make. This one, though, seems like their least commercially viable film to date, steeped in Jewish traditions that are definitely going to be off-putting for a lot of the audience. It's the most religious movie of the year. Michael Stuhlbarg plays a college professor living in the suburbs of the Twin Cities in the 1960s. He has a pretty normal life - two kids and a wife. His annoying brother has hit hard times and lives with them, though he doesn't find him as annoying as his kids do. Stuhlbarg's life begins to fall apart when his wife announces that she wants to leave him for a family friend (Fred Melamed) and that it is his responsibility to get a lawyer and a rabbi to perform the official ceremony. He never knew there was anything wrong, and he's stuck wondering why things have gone this way and where they will go - which leads him to his rabbis. The two he sees don't really help him much, or at least he doesn't think they do at first. The plot is pretty simple, really, but a lot of the film seems like a puzzle right now - the message at first seems like you have to take whatever comes. Life doesn't always have a specific meaning. But then the film's final moments seem to suggest a very basic morality, that when you do good things, good things will happen, and, much more likely, vice versa. And then you have to fit in the prologue of the film, a Jewish fairytale that doesn't initially seem to have anything to do with the rest of the movie. Much like the Coens' previous film, Burn After Reading, A Serious Man feels like the sort of movie that leaves you a tad disappointed at first, but which could really benefit from a second viewing. Not sure I'll ever consider it one of their better films, but, yeah, it's definitely something to think about.",A Serious Man

The rest of the cast seem unfamiliar to me but that's a plus. They do an excellent job in their roles. They're believable and realistic in portrayal of Jewish American life in the Midwest. The story is about Larry Gopnik, a physics professor on tenure track. All is going well until his wife, Judith, announces that she's in love with his friend Sy Ableman and wants a Getta to get remarried in a religious ceremony. He and his brother have to move to the Jolly Roger Motel while he's getting divorced. His son, Danny, is being bar Mitzvah and goes to Hebrew School. His daughter Sarah spends time cleaning her hair or trying to get use of the bathroom when her uncle isn't in there doing something.

23,blanbrn,A film that blends comedy and drama. It proves that life is uncertain and meant for some to be ordinary and deal with the hand given to them.,8,5 November 2009,"The Coen brothers as always make films that speak to audiences at the same time they entertain in interesting ways and they end up leaving a viewer to think ex:(""No Country for Old Men"", and ""Fargo""). As in this film ""A Serious Man"" it's blended with humor and drama to keep a viewer with a steady mixed diet of fun and it leaves them thinking at the end and it proves just how life rolls for some.Michael Stuhlbarg is Larry Gopnik an ordinary man who's extremely intelligent living in middle America in 1967 and he earns a living as a physics professor. Yet all of a sudden his life will start to come apart when he learns that his wife Judith is leaving him as she's fallen in love with another man one who's more outgoing. To complicate matters Larry's unemployed brother Arthur(veteran Richard Kind) who has a knack for trouble is sleeping on his couch add to the fact that Larry's kids trouble him in ways of money and discipline.Larry's biggest dream of moving up for promotion at the university is sabotaged by a crude anonymous letter campaign that is destroying him. Perhaps it stems from a graduate student trying to bribe him for a passing grade. Searching for answers Larry seeks advice from rabbis, he wonders can anyone help him is he righteous or too serious? This is a film that questions faith, and responsibility it ask were some meant to be subjected for pain and a life of uncertain dramas. As it goes some guys have all the luck and some don't get any breaks as the film ends with some bad news for Larry too.

24,lasttimeisaw,A Serious Man,7,24 September 2010,"Firstly, I guess one thing Coen brothers want to tell us from A SERIOUS MAN is that science and religious are both sides of a coin, the notorious cat proves the uncertainty of the universe meanwhile the Jewish rabbi advises our protagonist to accepting the uncertainty without questioning God as he is not responsible for giving us all the answers.A SERIOUS MAN shows that Coen brothers have perfected their masterly skill in black comedy with more ruthless ambitions, from the hideous prologue, the Jewish vignette successfully gave me a creepily chilling feeling which I took as a portentous signal that maybe the film would never be as funny as I had thought (the fact is that it is categorized in COMEDY genre). I must admit that for me this film creates many barricades in front as I know nothing about Jewish religion, which undermined the certain pleasure and transformed it into an unsatisfied feeling as that I was intermitted by confusion and even boredom frequently, maybe I shall not blame it on Coen brothers, as this mini-budget indie feature is merely a retrospective personal work (after NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN and BURN AFTER READING's success and all-star cast). The cast consists of mainly unheard actors (as least for me), Michael Stuhlbarg embraces his first (but also his last) straw as a leading role in an important film with a vivid devotion, although almost of the time he looks like a funny version of Joaquin Phoenix. Surprised to see Simon Helberg (the Jewish nerd Howard in THE BIG BANG THEORY series) has a small cameo here, ironically he could be the biggest star among the cast. I have to mention the ending, has the same effect as the frog rain in MAGNOLIA (1999) or the earthquake in SHORT CUTS (1993), the upcoming tornado is truly making its finishing point potently and meaningfully, which makes me have to give a 7/10 instead of 6/10. This film was nominated as BEST PICTURE in Oscar this year, thanks for the double-sized quota and a further testimony of Steve Martin telling Christopher Waltz in the Oscar award ceremony this year earlier that authentically there are many Jews in Hollywood, even more than we thought. P.S. as A SERIOUS MAN could easily manage inside the top 10 list last year, there is no reason their more ambitious new version of TRUE GRIT (1969), will miss its spot inside this year's for Oscar next year.

25,KineticSeoul,Seriously intriguing,7,19 February 2010,"When watching this film I thought the build up would lead to something, but nothing. And while watching it you will start to wonder what it's trying to say. However the movie is bewitching, while somewhat portraying the life of Job from the Bible. The story is about a nice and honest guy named Larry Gopnik(Michael Stuhlbarg) a jew who is a Midwestern Professor of mathematics and bad stuff happens to him to the point he loses it. So basically it's about bad things happening to good people or person and it's also somewhat of a midlife cisis movie as well. The mystery behind the film is intriguing, but it's also confusing and not confusing at it's too complex to follow but you just don't know where everything is leading up to. But after viewing the film the second time and seeing every detail in it I sort of got some aspect of the film. The end may confuse some, but the story in this revolves around the story of Job in a bit of a modern time with a different outcome and felt the uncertainty was a nice touch. It's a good movie but the self-indulgent road the directors took sort of hurt the film.7.6/10",A Serious Man
26,Buddy-51,more comic darkness from the masters of the genre,8,14 February 2010,"""A Serious Man"" provides us with a view of 1960s middle class suburbia as only the Coen Brothers, in all their warped glory, could conceive of it.Larry Gopnik is a mild-mannered college professor who lives with his wife and two teenaged children in a spare, homogeneous housing tract, where every home comes replete with its own perfectly manicured lawn and gnarled antennae. Larry may be leading a life of soul-sucking banality, but it isn't until he discovers that his wife is planning to leave him for a mutual friend of theirs that he begins to question God's purpose for his life. The Coens deftly satirize the age-old Jewish propensity to heap scorn and guilt upon oneself when things aren't going well in life, and to seek out divine explanations for all one's problems, even with the awareness that such a search will likely lead to more questions than answers in the final analysis. Larry even has his own King David moment when he espies a neighborhood Bathsheba sunning herself in a nearby yard. But he's a David who, for all intents and purposes, has no real kingdom to rule over - his wife and kids being, at best, indifferent to his needs and dismissive of his authority - and no special connection to a God who remains stubbornly silent to all Larry's pleadings for help and understanding. In fact, the Biblical character he comes most to resemble is Job, as the afflicted man begins to question why, after a lifetime of trying to do the righteous thing, God has suddenly seen fit to rain down all sorts of trials and tribulations onto his increasingly balding head.It makes perfect sense for ""A Serious Man"" to be set in the 1960s, a time when traditionalism and modernity were duking it out for supremacy, even in the drab placidity of a sterile suburb, the last spot on earth one would expect to find such upheaval taking place. Yet, unlike in urban centers or on college campuses where it was taking place out in the open and in full view of the public, the cultural revolution in suburbia was occurring largely within the nuclear family unit and behind closed doors. Thus, in ""A Serious Man,"" we have youngsters who study Torah in between smoking pot, listening to Jefferson Airplane on cheap transistor radios, and watching ""F Troop"" reruns on TV, and adults who plan their child's bar mitzvah while partaking in the ""new freedoms"" of divorce, marijuana and extramarital hanky-panky.With its relatively low-wattage drama, austere visuals and trademark inconclusive ending, ""A Serious Man"" is not a sure-fire crowd-pleaser on the order of a ""No Country for Old Men"" or ""Burn Before Reading"" (as much of a crowd-pleaser as any Coen Brothers movie can be, that is), but those with a taste for understated quirkiness should derive a great deal of pleasure from this movie. Jewish viewers, in particular, may find much to identify with in the knowing satire put forth by the authors.As Larry, Michael Stuhlbarg turns the ultimate nebbish into a perfectly recognizable everyman character. He receives fine support from the likes of Richard Kind as his troublesome older brother, Sari Lennick as his unfulfilled wife, Aaron Wolff as his socially awkward son, and a whole host of other superb secondary players too numerous to mention.",A Serious Man
27,cherold,"Unsatisfying, unamusing dark ""comedy""",3,27 October 2012,"The phrase ""dark comedy,"" which turns up in most descriptions of this movie, is an interesting one. It is technically accurate - the movie is deeply pessimistic and told in an exaggerated way through situations and characters that are exaggerated to the point of caricature. So you have to call it a black comedy, even though it's not actually funny.Instead of being funny, the movie is mainly just depressing. The main character is a Jewish milquetoast who is battered by life on all sides and seems incapable of fighting back, responding to clear injustices not with outrage but with stammering confusion. You just want to yell, ""man up!"" But instead of manning up, he seeks help from a series of unhelpful rabbis.The Coen Bros. clearly mean to say something with this movie, but I don't know what, and the non-ending leaves no clues behind. It is a movie that seems to consider all of life futile. I have mixed feelings about that message, but I would find it more tolerable in a comedy that was funny ha-ha rather than funny weird.",A Serious Man
28,ElMaruecan82,Larry Gopnik: Life's Weeping Man and God's Whipping Boy...,10,10 September 2016,"Whether the goofy hillbillies in ""Raising Arizona"", the Irish mob in ""Miller's Crossing"" or the nice people of Minnesotta in ""Fargo"", the characters who populate the Coen brothers' movies are such a world within the world they live in, that there's always a double promise of escapism with the two Coens, through the worlds each of their ingenuous movies create and through the characters' attempts to escape from it, or find a better way to fit in their eccentrically realistic environment. ""A Serious Man"" is no exception, but is still exceptional in its own way.And when you line up all the films the siblings made before, especially ""No Country for Old Men"", the highlight of their career, crowned with a Best Picture Oscar, you realize that a more personal film, one revisiting the Coen brothers' Jewish roots, was overdue. And ""A Serious Man"" centers on the Midwest Jewish community in 1967, and is so centered I thought the opening was set in a kibbutz, but it's very much in the Midwest, an interesting contrast that doesn't confine to 'clash of cultures' for all that, because, the real clash is actually an internal one, which makes the 'escape' even more problematic.The poster shows the main protagonist Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) standing alone on his roof. He lives in one of these vast suburban areas with identical houses, without any fences to separate between the lawns, a depressingly geometrical and empty landscape where Larry wanders... and wonders: maybe there's more to fix in his life than this goddamn antenna. This is a brilliant mind, a math professor capable of filling a giant blackboard with the most complex equations, but can't solve the equation of his own life. Indeed, he's a faithful husband, a good father yet his wife, Judith (Sari Lennick), wants a divorce and his son and daughter steal his money, respectively for marijuana and a nose-job. Something must be wrong, and the enigma of the poster is whether he contemplates his failure out there or thinks of questioning 'God' up there.And God, though it's not the proper appellation in the film's context, is so many times evoked that you can almost count him as a protagonist, because when He doesn't act, people behave according to Him. The kid (Aaron Wolff) is preparing his Bar Mitzvah and Judith asks for a ritual divorce so she can religiously marry her lover. The lover, who happens to be Larry's best friend, has quite a fitting name: he's Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed) and he's got the nerve to tell Larry that for 'moral' reasons, he's got to sleep in the next motel and he's so calm, so naturally authoritarian that his smile and tone and his patronizing way to tower over Larry, put the 'suave' in persuasive. I used to say that happiness is measured on three levels: professional, personal and sentimental, if we get two out of three right, there's no need to complain. Well, Larry has all the reasons to complain. Even professionally, there's an impending vote over his tenure compromised by a series of anonymous letters defaming him, there's also a South Koran student bribing him first for a good mark in the Math exam, and threatening to reveal the bribe if it's fruitless. This is just too much for a man, and as a devoted Jew, he's driven into the corner where he must consult the rabbis, the Great Rabbi Marshak isn't available but the other Rabbis' answers reminded me of that old joke: someone tells a Jew why they always answer a question by another question, to which the Jew replies ""what makes you think so?"". This sums up the existential block of poor Larry.I also thought of that wonderful episode of South Park when Kyle's parents read him the story of Job, and when he asked them: why would God punish a devoted man just to make point? The blank look on the parents was the perfect punch line for the joke of life. Humor is sometimes the best answer to the absence of answer. God might move in mysterious ways but as far as Larry's concerned, he's not in his good papers. He might try as hard to be a 'serious' man, he'll never be like the serious men in the general perception, which means men whose actions have a weight on their community, whose aura and moral magnitude inspires respect. He's a man of dysfunctional seriousness, with an unfaithful wife, a pot-smoking teenage kid, a superficial daughter and a mentally-advanced yet socially-awkward brother (Richard Kind) And we're left in mystical puzzlement: if God exists then He simply doesn't like Larry, maybe this is the curse inherited from the Jewish fable that opens the movie, suggesting a curse that might have struck his ancestors. Or maybe God doesn't exist and it's all random, but the randomness is so insistent that even the most blatantly skeptic can't help but see a strange malevolent pattern. The film doesn't even question the non-existence of God, He's here as a character and from Larry's perspective, acts like an antagonist whose actions must be accepted. The film doesn't necessarily target the Jewish but the religious people who wonder why life is so tough as if God owed them something. Maybe the randomness is part of a greater scheme, or maybe there's a divine pattern or... it's just that some people are screwed whatever they do.After a recent streak of bad luck, I used to think that ""someone up there didn't like me"" and then I got ""everything will be all right"". Well, I wonder why God would allow kids to die from war and hunger and give ME a special treatment. I guess it all comes down to one wish, if not God's darling, better not to be His whipping boy.",A Serious Man
29,paul2001sw-1,Before the storm,6,18 June 2013,"The Coen brothers' movie 'A Serious Man' tells a highly watchable story of 1960s Minnesota; and of a Jewish community who, to this secular European, are both remarkably Americanised (assuming they are mostly the product of recent settlement) yet also defined by their religion. The tale begins with a typical Coen brothers non-sequiteur, a brief, comic tale from 19th century Europe that has no direct bearing on the story that follows. That story is itself somewhat strange, the tale of a man whose life falls apart but also a tale that doesn't appear to go anywhere: there are some fine black comic moments, but it's hard to detect the purpose of the tale, which (as is usual for Coen brothers films) is relatively light on emotion.

One of my favorites was how his wife's lover talks to him so condescendingly, with the appearance of great kindness and wisdom. It works on its own as a comedy, but has other dimensions. Another great scene is the rabbi telling the story about the goy's teeth with Jimi Hendrix's 'Machine Gun' playing in the background, and in the way he does so, perhaps conveying the frustrating part about the human condition, our limitations and yet somehow our rather smug belief in ourselves. The Coen brothers mix in surreal elements and provide a window into being a Jew in suburban America, all while playing with notions of faith and our smallness. Standing in front of a giant set of chalkboards with an extensive mathematical theorem worked out, the professor says ""The Uncertainty Principle proves we can't ever really know what's going on."" The film honors faith and Jewish culture preserved over millennia, but at the same time, its skepticism is subversive, the combination of which may mirror the paradox of Schrodinger's cat.

Very Coen Brothers--moving, sometimes disturbing, and sometimes very hilarious.For insiders--American Jews--the references and send-ups will be moving and funny and familiar. For outsiders--goys--A Serious Man is an indoctrination, a can opener to an ethnic world with deep roots (Eastern European in this case), great integrity, and many internal (modern) conflicts.

Some of the acting is amazing, Michael Stuhlbarg playing the line between tragedy and farce in every scene, and the filming is expert without ever drawing attention to itself. The ending will leave many people talking and it isn't appropriate to do that here, except to say that in some ways it leaves you thinking so hard you may read more into the events than is really there.Or not. Certainly the first scene, if it is some metaphor for all the follows, is both trenchant and disturbing, more Babel than Singer, but perhaps (perhaps) frightening in its misogyny. In fact, the whole movie has men who are wise, who laugh at their fate, who do good things, and women who, one way or another, stick the knife in you.And who (or what) is the dybbuk here? Is this about the survival of some kind of Judaic history in contemporary America? Or is it larger, about the meaning of Judaism period, on a worldly level? Or larger still, is it simply a movie, like Do the Right Thing or My Big Fat Greek Wedding or any of thousands of others, about life, and love, and the struggling of one person against the woes of the world as he or she faces them, in their own context?Or is it a comedy, a really funny comedy, making fun, having fun, and rising above the tawdry enough to remind everyone, Jewish or not, of the need we all have for community and connection and continuity.",A Serious Man

I expected some Coens stuff, but overall it was all over the map, and i didn't made me feel or thing anything, and thats so disappointing because the opening of the movie, first 10 minutes left me speechless, i watched it for 2 times, it's one of the best, most hilarious and surprising openings in the movie history, really, it's that good. So believe me how surprised i was, that later this film didn't deliver at all, it has nice acting, but so what? After they winning performances with ""No Country For Old Men"", Coens must have took holidays with ""A Serious Man"". You can safely skip this one.",A Serious Man
34,ironhorse_iv,"I accept the mystery. Still, this movie is too depressing.",7,30 June 2014,"For a movie directed by Joel & Ethen Coen, this movie is seriously a let-down. Don't get me, wrong. It's a very well-made intelligent movie, but there is little to no reason why to watch a movie about a Minnesota Jewish man; life crumbles around him. Audience would only go see a movie like this, if the protagonist somewhat triumph in the end, because it gives them, a reason to be encouraging about their own lives, when showcasing somebody fixing their own. Sadly, the movie doesn't provide this. Real life is already too depressing; why go see a movie to watch the same thing that you hear all the time. It really fails to be entertaining. If the movie wasn't so much a thinker man movie about questioning faith, it would be a waste of time. Michael Stuhlbarg is brilliant as Larry Gopnik. He is nothing less than genius in this movie. I can find him, teaching Schroedinger's Cat physics to everybody in real life. I also believe in him as a moral man whose actions are justifiable. Everything he does, his motives, and actions altogether desires for goodness. He follows what he thinks is right from his reasoning and conscience. You see it, through Stuhlbarg use the tone of his voice and his facial features. You can really see his disappointment in life, when other get away with cheating on their way to greater success than him. He seems to suffer, trying to live a righteous life. The movie is almost a modern telling of the book of Job with the concept. There are also hints to other stories like David & Bathsheba or the story of Uxbal. While the movie is indeed, about keeping your values no matter what. That message kinda get lost in the movie full of Jewish culture references like Mentaculus, Behar, and the Yiddish translations. The movie even opens up with what seem like a historical folktale of a Jewish couple and a rabbi that has to deal with a dybbuk, a reanimated spirit in Judaism. I supposed, it's to give a demonstration of the film's conflicts like faith vs. reason, with Gopnik's ancestors, making the same mistakes as Larry does in the film, but it's seem out of the blue, and never mention again. It doesn't really affect the rest of the film. The only thing I can possibly interpret about this movie is that either the Coens are saying that it's the lone and rare individual who might be honorable, but that the outside world typically isn't, even where it's bound up in religion or whatever, and that the central professor character was actually the only one ""favored by God"" in this situation, but that he ultimately failed God's test of integrity. Accepting the mystery clearly a reference/parallel to the Schroedinger's Cat paradox explained throughout the movie. Now that Larry has made a choice, is he dead or not dead. We can't ever really know what's going on. Sometimes, the verbal symbolism is clear, and in others, it's not. A good example of this, is the odd scene with the Jewish dentist seeing Hebrew writing on a non-Hebrew man's mouth. The movie never explains it well, and by the end, it's never resolved. Yes, the movie was willing to show depth, and yes, not every question, need to be answer, but come on, what was the point of that Hebrew teeth scene if you're never going to bring it up, again. It felt like a shameful tease. I shouldn't be surprised as characters in the film, love leaving their stories on an inconclusive note. It's seem like the movie was indeed, based on the Coen's life 1960s Minnesota, growing up. It really does show with Larry Gopnik being very close to their own father. One thing that bugs me about some critics, is how they think the movie is anti-Semite. It's far from that. The movie is written by Jewish writers, for a mostly Jewish cast. It's not like all the Jews in the film, are playing up to their stereotypes. Even, the implied anti-semitism of the Gopnik neighbors kinda dies down when the Koreans come into the picture. I do have to think the portrayal of Asian-American is a bit odd. Clive Park (David Kang) and his father both speaks broken English, lives in Minnesota, in 1960s and can't do math. They seem out of place. I know a lot of Koreans that live in Minnesota, but in the 1960s? Yes, it's estimated 10,000 Korean children have been adopted by Minnesota families alone, but this doesn't make any sense. At less, Clive Park could had speak better English. No wonder, why he's failing in school. I guess, the movie was trying to say something about being branded, but once again, it's lost its meaning when the movie end, the way, it did. This Black Comedy is mostly a miss than a hit in the funny bone. The way, the movie was shot is beautiful. There is some harsh language, some sexuality/nudity and brief violence, but nothing too extreme. The music score is pretty good. Great use of establish songs like 'Somebody to Love"" by Jefferson Airplane. Overall: Any attempt to analyze the film will reveal a tangle of mixed messages, incongruous scenes, and a generally incomprehensible mess of unresolved sub-plots. Given the subject matter of the film and the style of the creators, this is almost certainly intentional. The movie is really hard to understand and you'll find yourself with a headache. With that, the mood of the film just continue to sink lower and lower that it just soul-crushing. It's just a brimstone sermon, made for a film. It's a hard watch. Still, it was a bit interesting.",A Serious Man
35,kenjha,An Inside Joke,7,28 September 2010,"A Jewish professor's life is turned upside down through a series of events in this bizarre comedy. The film starts with an extended prologue, a Yiddish skit that has no bearing on the film proper. The Coens make no attempt to explain the significance of this prologue. This exclusionary attitude is prevalent throughout the film, which seems to be a series of inside jokes that don't add up to a satisfactory whole. However, the Coens are always interesting to watch, even when they are at their most indulgent. It is well acted, particularly by Stuhlbarg as the hapless hero. While rewarding at times, this film ultimately feels like a shaggy dog story.",A Serious Man
36,Rodrigo_Amaro,Simplicity is the key in another memorable film directed by the Coen's,10,6 February 2011,"You are warned at the very first scene about how you must react to ""A Serious Man"" in a positive but arguable quote delivered by Rashi: ""Receive with simplicity everything that happens to you"". That's why you're gonna see everything falling apart on teacher Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) because he wants answers to all his problems and solutions to everything, after all he teaches physics and it is the only place where some things are impossible.Coen's brothers presents a black humor comedy that goes in a nihilistic and pessimistic way, a karma where the main character will not get out, will not solve his problems with his family, students, neighbors and others surround him, even trying to meet a Rabbi who can give answers to him of why all bad things happen to him. Larry's life is a real nightmare with a wife cheating on him with his serious friend Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed), two sons, a problematic boy in his way to his Bar Mitzvah a and a girl who actually we don't have time to know more about her; his brother (Richard Kind) lives with him, trying to develop a project and keeping most of his time in the bathroom (reasons unknown); and many problems teaching a complex subject to uninterested students. His life is a nightmare and when he sleeps here comes more nightmares that involves bizarre dreams with Sy attacking him and things like that. Over and over again, more and more things are added to a chaotic situation.The fact that the main characters are Jewish doesn't mean that only them has problems, it was just a original and clever aspect used in the film to present a culture like any other who also has its difficulties; but the film could have been portray any other and would be as much as interesting than this film. Almost coincidental was the fact that during the same week I watched ""A Serious Man"" I was reading Philip Roth's ""Portnoy's Complaint"" who had a similar theme but with more funny presentation and controversial subject and comparing both works seems to be a positive thing, it opens your eye to a different view of the world. If you look to a certain perspective seeing it as a simple story you're gonna find something funny in the story of Gropnick, but looking at another angle it's a whole drama that never answer what you want but only what you need to know: that life is more simple than we know, bad things happen in the speed of the light, increasing stress and another diseases and being serious persons as we are we must accept that just like Larry Gopnik who doesn't know how to fight back with his life situations. And perhaps the secret of life is not be taken so seriously, life and ourselves shouldn't be so serious about anything. Have some faith and things might work.But ""A Serious Man"" is a funny and hilarious film once you get the joke, once you see that things are not so common in Gopnik's family (his wife wants him out of his own house because her lover needs to live there; the Asian student that failed in his exam because hi didn't know Mathematics will be required in a Physical test; Gopnik's son running away of a bully kid who wants his money back and for some strange reason we never see this kid's face until the very last shot; Gopnik's nightmares that really knows how to shaken us until we realize it was only a dream, we burst in laughter with all that and more). But the most memorable moment comes when the old Rabbi gives to Larry's son the secret of life, an answer to everything in something that is very appreciated by him and is presented throughout the film. I loved the scene and laughed a lot too.Everything works perfectly in ""A Serious Man"" from writing and direction to performances and a soundtrack with Jefferson Airplane's 'Somebody to Love' being played very significantly, it stays with you for a long after you see it. It has one of the most inconclusive endings of all time, it disappoints many viewers (who like Gropnic wants a meaning to things) but it didn't disappointed me at all; I can accept that some movies are like life, it is journeys and not destinations and the best we can do is watch it and live it to the fullest. And enjoy it! 10/10",A Serious Man
37,merklekranz,Depressing with unlikable characters .......,3,8 December 2020,"Probably one of the most depressing movies ever made, ""A Serious Man"", is relentless in its ""downer"" storyline. Watching the trauma inflicted is worse than a trip to the Dentist. Speaking of the Dentist, the sequence about the inscribed teeth is a perfect example of the numerous dead ends without meaning that the audience is subjected to. Michael Lerner even makes an appearance, without dialog, that seems gratuitous at best, and totally unnecessary at worst. There is basically no storyline, the film is merely a series of skits, strung together, and leading nowhere. If you are looking for entertainment, look elsewhere. If you are looking to be depressed, this is your movie. Not recommended, and probably one to avoid. MERK",A Serious Man
38,johnnyboyz,"Stiff, involving and often blackly amusing Coen brother's comedy displaying the best of their often underexposed talents within this domain.",7,12 September 2011,"Poor Larry, the lead character in the Coen brothers' film A Simple Man; he looks a little like Barton Fink, he of the film of the same title a whole eighteen years prior to this one – even suffers through similar levels of anguish to that of Fink; a man whose life was seemingly sauntering on swimmingly before a shift in gears precedes a whole load of colourful characters infiltrating his existence and generally contributing to a downfall in normality. The crises of confidence and depiction of things mounting up against unprecedented odds is similarly what's depicted here; a patient comedy never at once exploiting nor heaping misery upon that of set-social groups for cheap, mean spirited laughs and in the process doing well to deftly involve a number of other supporting characters within Larry's family to the central tract.The film opens with an amusing skit, of sorts, prior to the main body of the film, of which is a 1960's set tale of the lives of the Gopnik family in suburban Minnesota America out there in the Mid-West. Like a short cartoon before a feature in days of old, the Coen's ease us into the overriding experience with an amusing dialogue driven short that's funny; blackly humorous; contains a splash of death; its own amusing twist and generally maintains a sense of the nasty or of the sordid unfolding in that distinctly underplayed manner – the entire first segment, in all of its five minutes, more involving than practically the whole of the brothers' last film, 2008's Burn After Reading, in spite of containing most, if not all, of the same characteristics. Enter Michael Stuhlbarg's Larry Gopnik, a lecturer in mathematics at a local university in good health, established via an early scene at a nearby surgery, and maintaining life as a husband and father to the homestead.Where Larry goes from there conforms to the body of the film's content, the pristine nature of his life, what with decent home locale; good health; career organised and large family to keep him company, eventually disintegrating into a series of comedic set pieces in which the man tries to make sense of what happens to him. At work, Larry must reject the advances, in the form of a bribe, from a Korean student due to fail one unit that will mangle his entire course result. On another pathway, and despite the continuous reassurances from supervisors and other members of staff, we are not convinced of Larry's job security; a number of anonymous complaints from students and such acting as a proverbial cloud looming over Larry's already gradually rocky proceedings. At home, his wife Judith (Lennick) reveals that an extra marital affair with a certain Sy Ableman (Melamed) has been transpiring; a long time friend turned love rival with a warm voice carrying with it a sorrowful tone. Meanwhile, a hard-nosed neighbour preoccupied with ideas of masculinity, whilst seemingly carrying with him degrees of xenophobia, appears to be encroaching onto the Gopnik's land via their lawn, with brother Arthur (Kind) loitering in the background appearing to struggle with his own issues of mental illness.Intermingling with Larry's descent is the tale of his son Danny (Wolff), whose inability to comprehend a school-set lesson in Hebrew scripture he sits through in his opening scene mirrors that of our initial struggles with an awful lot of what transpires within this Jewish community. He ignores most of what transpires in the class, choosing instead to listen to a pocket radio through an earpiece and yet comes across as the most intent pupil in the room at that time going on general body language, inferring a general sense of the character on a cusp of something and perhaps vulnerable to swaying either way in regards to adhering to an honest, orthodox Jewish living and a more rebellious stretch away from such things. Such an item does indeed rear up when it is revealed his Bar Mitzvah is approaching.His behaviour confuses the principal when he is caught, the man staring blankly at the confiscated item as orthodox tradition clashes with fresher technology and the more contemporary ways of the youth. Danny owes money to another student; a harder, meaner student whose ability and presence is established on a busy bus journey home from school whilst the person in question is still off screen, and whose cash Danny has, but was hidden in the now confiscated wireless causing problems of its own. Observing Danny's strand is a playful excursion from the central tract, Danny's apparent rise to a significant checkpoint in his life standing in stern conjunction to his father's proverbial 'falling' from heady heights, and it is blended in neatly on top of Arthur's own realisations. A Serious Man is a comedy from the Coen brothers that is not loud, nor obtrusive; it is a comedy from the Coen brothers coming at us in that fashion that doesn't draw attention to itself, and is much better as a result - the sort of comedic film they're capable of making away from the likes of O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Intolerable Cruelty. It is the sort of comedic film better played and infinitely more rewarding.",A Serious Man
39,filipemanuelneto,Reflecting on the meaning of life,6,29 June 2017,"Although they sometimes provide us with almost incomprehensible films and this is quite unpleasant, the Coen Brothers deserve my respect for the very skillful way they usually balanced themselves, with one foot in intellectual cinema (which spends more time in festivals than in theaters) and another foot in the common commercial cinema. In this case, I confess that I was expecting something different, although I do not know exactly what I was expecting.The film has a very simple yet effective structure, clearly inspired by the biblical story of Job: Larry is a respected Jewish teacher who teaches at a Jewish college, is married, and has a couple of children. But his life quickly turns into an ordeal: his wife has a lover and asks for a divorce; His children only think of them and the younger one uses drugs; His job at school is put at the stake after a dissatisfied student causes him some problems... this dilemma makes Larry turn to his faith and seek an answer to the simpler question: ""Why"". The Jewish rabbis are unanimous: this is an answer we almost never get. The audience understands the story but the subliminal message is so subtle that it can pass alongside. The ending, open and sudden, displeased me because I was waiting for a conclusion. Only later I understand that the end of the movie comes when we least expect it, just like the end of our life.Religion and philosophy are always present. However, it's not one of those films that you need to have a PhD to understand, although it's complex and tries to provoke some reflection. It's also far from being preachy because, as I easily realized, religion is almost an element of humor and parody. Nor could the irony of the Coen Brothers be absent. In addition to all the jokes around religion, there is also harsh criticism of our society. All the people in the film appear to be honest, serious and reliable but this, as the film subtly reveals, is an illusion. Each one has its sins and things that they want to hide, but they are ""serious men"".",A Serious Man

41,howard.schumann,Mostly a demeaning exercise,7,23 November 2009,"A while ago I asked a wise man what the meaning of life was and he said, ""Life's a joke and the joke's on us"". Well, the joke is on us if we can derive any serious philosophical insights from The Coen Brothers' black comedy A Serious Man, a catalog of the bad things that happen and then happen again to ""good"" people. Though the film is willing to question what it all means from the Jewish perspective and can be very funny, it is mostly a demeaning exercise that is lacking a profound respect for the power of human beings, Jew or Gentile, to create satisfying and fully productive lives.The film opens in a Jewish shtetl in Poland at an unnamed time, telling the story in the best Yiddish tradition of a good natured couple (Allen Lewis Rickman and Yelena Shmulenson) who may or may not have invited a dybbuk (the soul of a dead person) into their home. Moving ahead to a suburban Jewish community in Minnesota in the late 1960's that reflects the environment of the Coens' childhood, if there is a logical connection to the Prologue, Physics professor Larry Gopnick (Michael Stuhlbarg) may be paying for the curse of his ancestors or a mistake in a previous life. His wife (Sari Lennick) tells him that things have not been going well and that she wants to obtain a ""Get"", a religious divorce so that she can remarry the recently widowed Sy Abelman (Fred Melamed) in a Jewish ceremony.Before Larry can say Jolly Roger Motel, a Korean student (David Kang) tries to bribe him to change his grade so he can keep his scholarship, his department head tells him there have been anonymous complaints about him that may interfere with his application for tenure, and his dumpy unemployed brother Arthur (Richard Kind) who lives with them is talked to by the police for his gambling and other strange habits. There is also his daughter Sarah (Jessica McManus) who is saving money for a nose job and Larry's young son Danny (Aaron Wolff) who is having trouble concentrating on his studies for a Bar Mitzvah but not having trouble smoking pot, listening to Jefferson Airplane, or eluding the bully who wants him to return the radio he lent Danny that was confiscated in Hebrew class.As if these troubles weren't enough, Larry gets repeated calls at work telling him he owes four months of payments for the Columbia Record Club, which he does not remember joining. Though the opening quote from the Jewish philosopher Rashi tells us to ""receive with simplicity everything that happens to you,"" and a junior rabbi wisely tells Larry to change the perspective in which he views events, this wisdom is largely ignored. Rather than turn inward to see why things are unfolding the way they are, Larry plays the ""why me?"" game, asking friends, lawyers, a sultry neighbor, and various rabbis, themselves all Jewish caricatures who lack any inner life, why God has turned against him. Rabbi Nachter (George Wyner) tells him about a local Jewish dentist who found Hebrew letters spelling ""help me, save me"" engraved on the inside of a patient's teeth. The dentist searched for answers but just decided to go on living his life and helping others along the way.Larry is baffled by this story and conversation. ""Why does Hashem make us feel the questions if the answers aren't going to be given?"" Once again, the rabbi replies, ""I don't know."" The Coen Brothers confront the questions but throw up their hands and fall back on the tired advice that ours is not to reason why – that we must just ""accept the mystery"". For the fresh perspective that Larry is seeking, he might have been better advised that the God he is seeking is inside rather than outside and that to turn his life around requires accepting responsibility for what has ""gone wrong"", communicating it and expanding his power to give and receive love. Unfortunately, the Coen Brothers do not appear to be in a space in which opening one's eyes is a consideration.",A Serious Man
42,TheMovieDiorama,"A Serious Man, in typical Coen fashion, chronicles a troubled man questioning his own faith.",7,16 June 2018,"Admittedly I am not the biggest fan of the Coen brothers. I find their films slightly derivative, particularly their black comedies, that rely too heavily on religious subtext to convey a modern character. This time, they tackle Judaism. A religion more personal to the directors, where their heritage bursts through the screen. But it is too overpowering? A family man has his life crumble within days after his wife files for divorce, his career takes a stumble and his family remain mysterious to him. With both his personal and professional life in turmoil, this leads him to question his own faith. Challenging themes of mortality, misfortunate and Jewish traditions, the Coens have crafted an intimate character study that utilises dark humour for dramatic intentions. The eccentric comedy surprisingly flows well, whether it be self-referencing specific Jewish routines (specifically a ""Get"") or an older teacher experiencing earphones for the first time. It adds light buoyancy to the subtext heavy screenplay, resulting in a more entertaining film than the title suggests. Stuhlbarg gives a nuanced central performance which is certainly one of his career bests. Quirky yet commanding. Clean direction from the Coens and consistently wonderful cinematography from Deakins. Yet, again, I find myself grasping for more. Maybe I'm too oblivious to some of the more subtle themes, but I find some of the execution rather pretentious and unnecessary. The five minute prologue illustrating a Dybbuk felt out of place, and I'm sure you will all tell me ""you're wrong"". Aside from Stuhlbarg, no one else stood out which consequently left many other characters distant and cold. Even as a non-fanatical critic, this is not the Coens best. Although, it is undeniably intelligent, aesthetically pleasing and unsurprisingly witty. Stuhlbarg saves this from a complete serious bland bore. Maybe, just maybe, I've come to the realisation that I'm not ever going to truly appreciate the ingenuity of the Coens...",A Serious Man
43,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Natural and excellent next step for the Coens' cerebral probing of life's toughest questions,10,21 October 2009,"The Coen brothers have developed critical acclaim for making black comedies/awkward tragedies that depict small-time people getting in way over their heads, who for one reason or another are motivated to do things out of the ordinary because the natural order of the world and society has wronged them in some way. ""A Serious Man,"" however, is about a man who doesn't do anything, to whom bad/annoying things happen. This story of a confused suburban Jewish man in the '60s wrestling with life's meaning is therefore an important step in the evolution of the Coens' theme-driven film-making. Borrowing on an autobiographical context (Minnesota, Judaism, etc.) for the brothers, it moves on to greater cosmic questions but with the same quirky and ironic spirit that have garnered the Coens all their deserved attention over the last 20 years.Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) is that one Coen brothers character in every movie -- you know, the innocent one who manages to suffer a seemingly unfair fate (think Steve Buscemi in ""The Big Lebowski"" or most recently Richard Jenkins' character in ""Burn After Reading"") -- only he gets to pilot this film. In that spirit, an unknown Stuhlbarg is cast in the lead (although he was clearly up for the challenge). Larry is a mild-mannered math professor with a family in an ideal suburban home only his wife wants a divorce and his kids are nightmarish. Little by little the annoyances of his life pile up from the foreign student trying to bribe him for a passing grade while simultaneously suing him for defamation to his socially immature brother (Richard Kind) who won't leave his house.Larry seeks answers from the rabbis in his community to understand the mess his life has suddenly become. One rabbi tells him he needs a change of perspective, another tells him the story of ""The Goy's Teeth,"" a hilarious bit about a dentist who tries desperately to make meaning of a Hebrew message engraved in a patient's teeth only to find he was better off not worrying about it. None of their advice seems to help at the time -- but it's dead on. The Goy's Teeth scene in particular is one of the brilliant moments where the Coen brothers let you know pretty clearly what their intentions are with the film while giving you something to laugh about. That's their strength and it's all over ""Serious Man.""Much like ""Burn After Reading,"" this film is one that makes a thematic point out of the audience's attempt to squeeze meaning out of everything. By turning Larry into a Job-like figure to whom inexplicable misfortune happens, we're forced to put everything into perspective. When Kind's character, Arthur, has a tantrum in the middle of the night wondering why God has given him nothing and he points out that Larry has kids and a job, suddenly our perspective changes. Suddenly everything we thought mattered in this film and was of critical importance is really not such a big deal. Our desperate search for answers in both our lives and in this film, our tendency to over-analyze and derive reason from everything comes to a halt; the Coen bros. have worked their magic again.""Serious Man"" is one of their best in recent memory because it not only feels rooted and personal for them, but it moves toward a greater discussion of previously treaded upon themes and plots from their previous work. It is a challenging film and those who have struggled with the Coen brothers before will struggle again, but for the cerebral and intellectual moviegoer it's outstanding. The truth is, we don't have all the answers to make sense of life's events (or a story's plot points) and neither do the Coen brothers. One insignificant character in the film who appears to have an answer to just one of Larry's myriad of minor problems dies instantly with hysterical irony. Don't go into ""A Serious Man"" looking for answers, go into it looking for a change of perspective. ~Steven C Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",A Serious Man

45,jzappa,"""I'm a Serious Man, Larry.""",10,4 May 2010,"It's been said already, but a truth must be made pervasive: This is the kind of movie you get to make after you've won an Oscar. The Coen brothers' unabashedly unique 14th film conveys all traces of a pet project, an act of grace and self-reflexive delight, and like a true Coen film, the viewer's contract with it is constantly shifting and under negotiation.It takes place in what I take for granted to be a Minneapolis suburb of their childhood, a flatland comprised of split-level homes with ample garages but not enough trees around them. In this realm, Larry Gopnik sincerely longs to be taken seriously and live by an ideal code of ethics, but does God take him seriously? He lectures on physics in front of a blackboard overwhelmed by baffling formulas that are mathematical cases for certitude, and in his own life, of what can he be certain? Zero. His wife is leaving him for his best friend. His son is listening to Jefferson Airplane in Hebrew school. His daughter is stealing money for a nose job. His brother-in-law is sleeping on the sofa and mingling in disreputable bars. His gun-nut neighbor scares him. The wife of his other neighbor is some kind of nymphomanic. A student attempts to bribe him and blackmail him simultaneously, a student who claims he'll lose his stipend if he fails Larry's exam, when obviously he does not need the stipend as he has enough money to bribe him. The tenure committee is getting anonymous defamatory notes about him.Opening with a gloomily absurd prelude in Yiddish, which offers us no clue as to whether or not we're watching the movie we expect, this atmospheric Job-like story occupies a Jewish society where the logical is made pointless by the cryptic. Gopnik can jam-pack all the blackboards he wants, and it won't make any difference. Perhaps since an ancestor invited the stray soul of a dead man to cross his threshold, Larry has been cursed.As well as the painstakingly alert cinematography, editing and overall baroque visual design, a good deal of the effect of A Serious Man comes from the manner in which Michael Stuhlbarg plays the role. He doesn't play Gopnik as a bungling idiot or a loser or a wuss, but as a buoyant enough man who can't process what is happening to him. What else can be ruined? Where can he get some satisfaction? Who can he make happy? In the sex arena, why are even his wet dreams, starring his cheeky neighbor, scary? Why does Sy Ableman, supposedly his best friend who is stealing his wife, talk with him with words of such anguish, compassion and appreciation? Does Ableman know Larry is cursed? Why do his kids ignore him? Why can no rabbi accommodate him with support or valuable guidance? As per the Coens' usual, the use of incongruity is the main source of the film's ironic humor, but also they have cast predominantly unknown actors, or those like Stuhlbarg, Fred Melamed and Richard Kind you've seen before, but you can't really place where. (Kind is actually fairly memorable as Larry David's imposing cousin on Curb Your Enthusiasm.) It feels like Joel and Ethan have been entertaining this piece for years, cooling their heels by ruminating on potential characters, seeing an actor and saying, ""Perfect Sy Ableman."" Because no one is a star or a name actor, none of them seem cast, but rather governed by fate.To some degree the most prominent standout might be Melamed as Sy Ableman. It's not a lead but he substantiates an overflowing aura in his first scene, when he's just a voice on the phone. This is the back-stabber who is absconding with Gopnik's wife, and he maintains it will be beneficial if they have a drawn out, friendly discussion. Such presumption, you almost have to take pleasure in it. Amy Landecker, also, is faultless as Mrs. Samsky. She makes the character alluring in a purely scientific way, however any cautious man would sense to keep the thinking above the torso. Sari Lennick, as Larry's wife, is effective at signifying in just a few scenes that she's leaving him not as much for infatuation or out of bitterness as that she feels the walls caving in on him and Sy Ableman is a ray of sunlight.There is an anecdote recounted in this haunting black comedy that I think functions as a fable echoing Gopnik's life and the film overall. It's a fable in the sense that it holds its moral point in its closing words. In one of the rare and precious films that reflects life as random and mystifying, possibly meaningless, a movie full of mystery and ending on a tight little cryptic note, it patches this creative little chestnut into the heart of the ever graceful framework. The key to the Coens' quality is their subversion, and inversion, of expected order and structure, which is in sync with their love of irony. Rather than the usual turning of a genre on its head, that key works to fit their deeply personal intentions like a glove.",A Serious Man
46,Turfseer,Coen Brothers' contempt for the Conservative Jewish Community of their youth proves unwarranted,4,19 February 2010,"'A Serious Man' begins with a short 'film-within-a-film"" illustrating an old Jewish folktale (spoken in Yiddish) about a Dybbuk--a malicious possessing spirit, believed to be the dislocated soul of a dead person. A man comes home and informs his wife that he met an old man in the street who the wife insists died three years ago. Suddenly, there's a knock on the door and the old man is welcomed in by the husband. The wife, however, is convinced that the man is an evil spirit and plunges a knife into his chest. The old man gets up and states he realizes he's not welcome in the home and walks out the door. The folktale serves as an introduction to both the internal and external arc of the story. In both cases, 'tsuris' (a Yiddish word which means troubles) comes to the film's main character, Larry Gopnik, and members of the conservative Jewish community he's part of.Larry is a physics professor at a local college in the Midwest circa 1967. He lives with his wife, son and daughter and an oddball uncle who at first seems a bit eccentric but later turns out to be completely dysfunctional. We soon realize that Larry is the embodiment of a modern-day 'Job', illustrating the old adage, 'sometimes bad things happen to good people'. The 'bad things' include one of Larry's Korean students who tries to bribe him with a large amount of cash, hoping that he'll change his grade. The student's father later threatens Larry with a lawsuit for defamation.Things begin falling apart completely for Larry when his wife announces that she's leaving him for the vapid Sy Ableman, an aging widower who hugs everybody who he comes in contact with. Since Larry is such a pushover, he agrees to Sy and his wife's demand that he move out of the family house and into a local motel. Things get worse when Uncle Arthur is arrested for gambling and later for sodomy. Larry ends up compromising his principles by pocketing the Korean student's bribe money and changing his grade in order to pay a rich lawyer to defend his dysfunctional uncle. Larry is also up for tenure at the college but one of his colleagues on the tenure committee tells him that someone has been sending letters to the committee, impugning his character. After Sy is killed in a car crash, Larry finds out (inadvertently through his wife) that it was Sy who bad-mouthed him to the committee.Things seem as though they're about to turn for the good for our modern day Job: Son Danny manages to do well at his Bar Mitzvah and Larry finds out that he's on track to get tenure. But at the last minute, Larry gets a call from his physician who wants him to come in immediately and discuss test results—although we don't see the scene with Larry meeting his doctor, the implication is that Larry is about to receive a cancer diagnosis.The Coen Brothers know how to tell a good story but they have created a group of caricatures, sort of a 'hate letter' to the conservative Jewish community they grew up in. The passive schlep Larry is the only sympathetic character in their entire narrative. Otherwise, every other character (and most of them are Jewish) are either nasty or ineffectual. It's one thing to ridicule a group of people, pointing out their shortcomings—but it must be done with affection and not contempt. Here, the Coen Brothers are always looking at their fellow Jews as if the glass was half empty and never half full.As Larry's life spirals out of control, his quest for guidance from members of his community falls on deaf ears. The Coens ridicule the community by showing how Larry receives useless advice from a succession of two Rabbis he visits. The first one is a Junior Rabbi who ultimately suggests that Larry passively accept whatever happens to him since we can never know what God has planned for us. The second, Nachtner, an older Rabbi, provides even more useless advice in the form of a parable about an orthodontist who discovers cryptic letters on a Goy's (non-Jew's) teeth. Larry is exasperated when there is no moral to the story and the Rabbi seems to enjoy reciting the tale simply for its own sake.Finally, there's a third Rabbi, Marshak, who appears extremely old and feeble. He declines to see Larry but later his son Danny has an obligatory meeting with him after his Bar Mitzvah. Rabbi Marshak had pocketed the transistor radio given to him by a Hebrew School teacher who earlier had confiscated it from Danny who was listening to the radio and not paying attention to anything said in class. The senile Marshak obviously had been listening to the radio earlier and recites a list of popular rock groups (including Jefferson Airplane) before handing the radio back to Danny.Whereas the member of the community are ineffectual, Larry's family members are a nasty bunch. In addition to his adulterous wife Judith, Larry's daughter Sarah filches money from him to pay for a nose job. Then there's Danny who's addicted to watching 'F Troop' on TV and who must always avoid the neighbor down the street, a youth who he's taken money from. The aforementioned Uncle Arthur won't get a job and ends up in handcuffs for molestation.As someone who was Bar Mitzvahed in 1966, a year before this story takes place, I well remember my own contempt for some of the rituals and convictions of my co-religionists. But as I grew older, I realized that everyone has their good points and bad. Unfortunately, the Coen Brothers smugly stand above the fray and delude themselves into believing that they're enlightening their audience. In actuality, the Coens remain in an earlier arrested period of development and provide an inaccurate view of the conservative Jewish community they're commenting on.",A Serious Man
47,Chris Knipp,The Coens get down and Jewish on man's predicament,9,5 October 2009,"Jefferson Airplane's ""Somebody to Love"" hovers over the scenes of the Coen brothers' A Serous Man, the story of a Sixties Minnesota Jewish college professor with a small family whose life starts to fall apart. One of the Coens' strangest and most thought-provoking films, this one is a black comedy, a meditation on Jewishness, and a modern rethinking of the Book of Job in a world where ""Hashem"" (God) isn't just incomprehensible but largely imperceptible. The movie has been seen as a mean-spirited product of self-hating Jews, but that's not right at all. Returning to their roots and their tribe, the Coens have never been more serious or, in their sardonic way, more kind. To see life as a cosmic joke is really quite orthodox. It just doesn't lend itself to easy answers. And the rabbis the professor consults haven't got any. They've got, basically, nothing.The time and place echo the Coens' own youth. One of them might have been preparing for his Bar Mitzvah like Danny Gopnik (Aaron Wolff), the son of the film's nerdy but utterly decent physics teacher hero, Larry Gopnik (the excellent Michael Stuhlbarg).'A Serious Man' begins with a little Yiddish prologue set in long-ago shtetl Poland when a wife stabs an old man who's done a good deed for her husband because she thinks he's a dybbuk, a dead person possessed by an evil spirit. (The sequence is serious and gentle, in the manner of the Yiddish theater, and not a joke.) When the old man starts to bleed and wanders out into the snow, the couple realizes they've brought on terrible luck.Terrible luck: that's what is visited upon Larry Gopnik. But first we see Danny listening to Sixties rock with an earpiece hooked to his transistor, in Hebrew class. The old teacher confiscates the little radio, and tucked into its case $20 the boy owes somebody.All the scenes are marked by the Coens' usual precision and elegance but the movie is tricky to watch because it changes focus so rapidly. It alternates between offhand polyphonic passages in which four things are going on at once to super-focused ones where only one very intense thing is happening; it asks us to laugh and be cynical but demands metaphysical speculation.The point is Larry has all this stuff going on at once: his wife (the implacable Sari Lennick) is leaving him, inexplicably, for the titular ""serious man,"" the unctuous, self-satisfied Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed), a widower who's wife died only three years ago. His hugs and reassurances of the value of communication show the feel-good clichés of the period used as a cynical ruse. At work, there's a Korean student Clive Park (David Kang) who tries to bribe Larry to change his F to a passing grade, and when Larry refuses, Clive's father threatens a lawsuit. The goy neighbors are vaguely menacing: they're infringing on Larry's property line. He's up for tenure, and somebody's sent the tenure committee letters impugning his morals. His useless brother Arthur, jobless and with a gambling problem, has come for refuge, and is sleeping in the living room. Larry's wife exiles them both to the Jolly Roger Motel. A ""sophisticated"" woman neighbor (Jewish, Amy Landecker) who sunbathes in the nude, tempts Larry to ""take advantage of the new freedoms."" Meanwhile there's a daily pinprick that may morph into a serious threat: calls keep coming to the department office to say Larry owes money to a record club he never joined.The children are simply not there. Danny is only interested in marijuana -- he goes through his Bar Mitzvah (almost as memorable a one as in Schlesinger's 'Sunday Bloody Sunday') entirely stoned -- along with getting better reception to watch a certain TV show, and rock music. (He learns his Torah passage nonetheless.) Danny's older sister goes to a club every day and is only interested in washing her hair.But all this is incidental, because as the formal inter-titles indicate, the central moments are Larry's attempts to consult with rabbis who will help him. But they're no help. ""I, too, have forgotten how to see him in the world,"" says one (Simon Helberg), with a non-Jewish name, who cites the parking lot as a vision of the wonders of creation. A higher-level rabbi(George Wyner), sipping tea, says, ""Something like this, it's never a good time."" The oldest, putatively wisest rabbi, Rabbi Marshak (Alan Mandell), won't see him at all. He sees Danny after his Bar Mitzvah, returns his transistor radio to him, and quotes Jefferson Airplane.Central to 'A Serious Man' is Jewishness -- true to the Coens' own origins: they grew up in a heavily Jewish neighborhood, where you went to the synagogue and got Bar Mitzvahed. You became a doctor, a dentist, a lawyer: and each of these professions comes in for an appearance, and Larry's various troubles leads him to more than one lawyer, with threatening bills -- it's a nightmare! -- but it's also steeped in mundane quotidian Jewish experience. The Coens' irony has applied to being Minnesotan in 'Fargo,' to being laid back in 'Big Lebowski.' But being Jewish is a good sight more central to their comic world-view. What are the Jews? The Chosen People. Chosen for what? The Holocaust? Every memory of Jewish pride is matched by a twin memory of humiliation and rejection. None of the people around Larry closest to him are any real help. But he remains a good man. He remains nerdy, but he's still admirable.In making Larry Gopnik, the humble schlep (a smart mathematician but a dumkopf when it comes to people) into a Job, they redeem him, and they take the torments of man in a world where God can't be located accessible to us and to their humor. Does Jewish experience make the torments of the modern secular world any more comprehensible? Maybe not; but it's what they've got to work with.",A Serious Man
48,Polaris_DiB,Another win about losers,9,27 October 2009,"Many people draw a pattern out of the Coen bros. rather unpredictable pastiche of genre-bending, twisted films, claiming that they make a drama and then a comedy. That explanation is sort of limited being that everything they make is both disturbing AND hilarious, and this would be two ""comedies"" after one ""drama"", but indeed A Serious Man is much closer to a comedic counter-point to No Country for Old Men than Burn after Reading was. Thematically and structurally, No Country for Old Men and A Serious Man are quite similar. In both, a moment occurs in which the main protagonist states, aloud, the solution, but misses it himself because he's not thinking. In No Country for Old Men, it's when Tommy Lee Jones' character describes cattle getting killed. Here, it's when the professor tries to help his brother but doesn't listen to the advice himself. Either way, they both have very similar endings as a result.Now, this movie is completely unpredictable in terms of where it's going, but like all Coen bros. movies, it makes perfect sense considering the characters and the situations. The parallels, however, to Job are heavy and by the ending the whole of the movie is very clear, resulting in possibly one of the most satisfying moments of reveal I've seen in cinema in a really long time. Plus, the idea of these two dark-humored and unique individuals taking on faith is just too much of a good thing to state simply in a review. In this case, seeing actually is believing, and one almost wonders why it took them so long to get around to doing it. But now that it's here, it fills a previously unrecognized gap in their ouevre.That said, I wasn't a fan of the dream sequences. I'm not sure they really served a lot of help to the plot line except the usual ""show the inner turmoil of the character"" which is well enough shone by his acting and dialog--Oh GOD the dialog, this movie was another win in that regard! Fans of the Coens may note the sort of Big-Lebowski-in-junior-high aspect of the kids while the dry understatement and talking-over-each-other popularized in Fargo describes the adults. Nevertheless, the Coens have turned to an interesting form of pastiche that is certainly noteworthy, but does sort of make one miss the more dynamic movements of their previous works. Still, after No Country for Old Men they've certainly strove fearlessly off into new territory, and it's compulsively watchable and ALWAYS surprising territory. I don't know how they'll keep it up, but somehow even the moments that are so obviously what would happen in these situations still catch you completely off guard, to hilarious, and horrifying, effect.--PolarisDiB",A Serious Man
49,meeza,Why so serious?,8,14 November 2009,"Filmmakers Joel & Ethan Coen have had a long history of being very serious men on their craft. These Coenheads have always contributed revolutionary mechanisms in their writing & direction on the eccentricities of social, domestic, and professional themes and how it mentally corrupts the human psyche. The Coens show some serious fine work again with their latest movie offering ""A Serious Man"". The film stars stage actor Michael Stuhlbarg as Larry Gopnik, a Jewish Physics Professor residing in a northern Minneapolis town during the 60's. Larry is a father of two disruptive tweens and a husband to a whimpering wife. Larry's suburban life turns upside down when his wife asks him for a divorce on grounds of her adulterous relationship, his teaching tenure is in jeopardy because of anonymous notes sent to his college's tenure committee, he is a victim of a defamation suit from one of his students, his Jewish faith goes into self-doubt status because of the insignificant advice he gets from several Rabbis, and a few more headaches along the way. All of this while preparing for his son's upcoming bar mitzvah. There are numerous zany characters that inhabit Larryworld including: his unemployed leeching brother Arthur, a sexy middle-aged female neighbor, a naïve divorce lawyer, and a gun-loving mad neighbor who loves to hunt with his young son, just to name a few. But this is primarily Larry's story and he is a Coen archetype protagonist- a relatively simple person caught up with outlandish dilemmas happening consecutively. There are many Judaic themes incorporated into ""A Serious Man"" that are important to insert on the telling of the downfall of a simple Jewish man, but could be a bit byzantine for viewers unfamiliar with Jewish customs. And that is my only serious nitpick on The Coens' film-making effort of ""A Serious Man"". One can see that the Coens' Jewish upbringing was a serious inspiration to the creation of a ""A Serious Man"". But they laid it a little Jew thick with all the Hebrew verbose & references; please don't add me to the Mel Gibson disciple list for that comment. It was just an objective observation. Stuhlbarg's calculated thespian work as Larry is one that could equate to a Best Actor Oscar Nomination. Even though my favorite acting performance of the film was Fred Melamed's work as Sy Ableman, the lanky talkie Jew who Larry's wife flings for. Melamed is an acting able man who should be considered for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nom. The scenes between Larry and Sy were a sigh of comic relief to many of the ""just subpar"" other scenes of the film. But seriously, ""A Serious Man"" should be taken a serious look at. **** Good",A Serious Man
50,st-shot,Serious is darkly hilarious.,9,9 November 2009,"The Coens are clicking on all cylinders in A Serious Man, their most perfectly realized film since Fargo a dozen years back. Minus big name stars, excessive violence and slam bang action they have crafted a breezy black comedy referenced with biblical and Yiddish folklore amid the drab lifeless 'burbs of 1967 Minneapolis.Math professor Larry Gopnik's American dream is playing out ( he's up for tenure) in steady if unspectacular fashion when a series of calamities befall him. A student attempts to bribe him for a passing grade, his neighbor is trying to claim some of his property, his disruptive brother who has moved in is arrested on a morals charge his daughter is stealing money for a nose job, his soon to be bar mitzvahed son spends more time getting high and listening to the Jefferson Airplane and watching F Troop than studying and his wife wants a divorce to marry a family friend. And the worst is yet to come. You think you've got problems. Leave it to the Coens though to mine comedy out of the chaos and inject suspense into the hum drum.Serious Man is filled with rich quirky characters and mundane actions of consequence. In the wake of the pestilence that's been brought down about his house Gopnik seeks advice from clueless rabbis and attorneys but gains more insight from a nude sunbathing neighbor he discovers while on the roof fixing the TV antennae. Brief innocuous conversations with neighbors, co-workers and students take on a subtle nebulous menace while comic coincidence results in tragedy. It's a Kafkaesque fun house with Larry as our guide. As faith challenged Larry, Michael Stuhlbarg gives a fine emotionally understated performance as he searches for rationale behind the calamities, saving his rages for Columbia Record Club debt collectors and isolated rant about the bribing student. The supporting cast ( especially Fred Melamed, Richard Kind and George Wyner) as assorted hurdles and bete noires work in perfect compliment to Gopnik and his dilemma.Visually Serious Man hammers home the barren prosperity to be found in the treeless suburban Midwestern platte and the lifeless interior of the Gopnik home, decorated with the mass produced grotesque big eyed art of the day that seemed to find its way on to every kitchen wall and behind every living room sofa in 1967. There are also some bravura visuals provided by way of Larry's nightmares and some compositions filled with provocative incidentals and distractions that evoke tension from benign situations. With its fresh, novel and unpredictable storyline A Serious Man once again has the brothers Coen at the top of their game as American Film's finest practitioners of the craft.",A Serious Man
51,CubsandCulture,Cheekily Agnostic,10,14 June 2021,"This is a loose adaptation the Book of Job-it deals pretty clearly with the problem of evil as well as trying to derive meaning from suffering. The Coen brothers' spin on the material through is the film is delightfully ambiguous in the final meaning of its plot elements. The script repeatedly invokes things like Schrodinger's Cat in which the two states of being can be both true until you look. But then the film doesn't look. The easiest example to see this is disconnected fable at the start of the film might or might not have a Dybbuk (Jewish folklore evil spirit) in it. The final script is extremely philosophical around these points. The film ends up being utterly agnostic and humanist in theme; to paraphrase the film ""we don't know, we don't know and it is a good idea to help others.""But best of all because of the acting, direction the film plays out like a comedy of errors. None of the deeper themes occur to you on the first viewing because you are having too much fun with the characters, dialog and gags. The film is clearly informed by the Coens' childhood and those personal themes also comes through. This is a really good film. I even find it a little hopeful regardless of the the punitive resolution for the main character.",A Serious Man
52,MaxBorg89,Seriously funny,10,19 January 2010,"It's a Coen brothers tradition: every time they make a movie (or two) that appeals a little bit more than usual to the masses, their next project is something a little more bizarre and hard to decipher - you know, for fans. Gangster pastiche Miller's Crossing was followed by the inscrutable Hollywood satire Barton Fink, the grotesque, ""cold"" atmosphere of Fargo by the hallucinations of The Big Lebowski, the Odyssey-riffing, Clooney-starring O Brother by the black-and-white ""noir"" The Man Who Wasn't There. Therefore, what better way to follow the hilarious, star-filled Burn After Reading than with a name-empty, ""smaller"", almost autobiographical feature? That's one of the best way to describe their fourteenth film, A Serious Man.Why ""almost"" autobiographical? Because although it takes place in the 1960s Midwest environment where the Coens grew up and features several names that are directly taken from their childhood (or at least that's what they have said), A Serious Man is not about two brothers with an odd sense of humor and good ear for dialogue named Joel and Ethan. Instead, it's the story of a Jewish Physics teacher, Larry Gopnik (stage actor Michael Stuhlbarg), who all of a sudden finds himself in all kinds of trouble: a student tries to bribe him, his wife wants a ritual divorce so she can marry another man, his son is preparing for the Bar Mitzvah (using marijuana) and his brother Arthur (Richard Kind) spends most of the time in the bathroom. As he lusts for a neighbor and ends up in a motel, Larry, who hasn't done anything at all to deserve so many misfortunes, tries to understand just what the hell went wrong. You know, strictly existentially speaking.A Serious Man is filled with obscure references, difficult vocabulary (most of the Jewish terminology remains unexplained) and even begins with an absurd prologue, all in Yiddish, seemingly unrelated to what comes next. It's also completely devoid of famous actors (Kind and Adam Arkin are only a minor exception since they regularly play supporting parts in American TV shows) and Coen regulars (minus an almost gratuitous cameo by Michael Lerner, the profane studio executive from Barton Fink), and leaves many plot threads dangling. And that's exactly why it ranks as one of the brothers' best films: even when they're making a mainstream picture about stupid people (Intolerable Cruelty or Burn After Reading), they always assume the audience is smart enough to draw their own conclusions. If not, well, there's always a new Michael Bay flick to watch.Additionally, the absence of Hollywood stars serves the picture's point to perfection: if Larry were played by, say, George Clooney or Brad Pitt, it would be a case of big celebrity messing with his own image in a quirky role (complete with weird haircut). By casting the excellent Stuhlbarg and all the other relatively unknown thespians, the Coens make sure we can relate to the various characters as people, not cinematic caricatures. It also gives more realism to the predictably exquisite way they speak (and traditionally silly names like Meshbesher) and to the movie's numerous forays into purely absurd humor, complete with a deliberately puzzling final shot that can be seen as utter genius or mere provocation (both points are valid).A Serious Man is by no means an easy picture, especially if one never really cared about the Coens' bewildering universe in the first place. Those who do care, on the other hand, will be able to experience one of the richest, most satisfying films of 2009, even if they don't immediately get the story of the dybbuk or the whole deal with the Goy's teeth.",A Serious Man
53,rooprect,Magnificent. The Coen Brothers take a detour.,8,8 January 2011,"Let me say up front that most fans of the Coen brothers' early films might be disappointed if they're expecting ""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowski"" or even ""O Brother"". Unlike those movies, here we don't have a lot of plot, comedy or action. The message of the film is very challenging, and it requires a lot of thought to figure out what they're saying.I'd say this movie is for fans of the recent American films ""Synecdoche NY"", ""Doubt"", and the recent Japanese films ""Departures"", ""Yureru"" and of course the classics by Kurosawa like ""Rashomon"". What I'm saying is that this is a film that tackles philosophical questions of perception, faith, and in particular, uncertainty.If you've had some physics, you're in for a real treat because much of the theme centers around Schrödinger's ""Uncertainty Principle"", briefly touched upon in the Coens' excellent 2001 film ""The Man Who Wasn't There"". Here they give us a more powerful dose. If you've never heard of this principle, don't worry, you can look it up on Wikipedia or you can accept my synopsis of it, which I'll warn you might be flawed because I ain't no physicist:The Uncertainty Principle (or ""Schrödinger's Cat"") proves mathematically that certain events are unknowable. It proposes the idea of a cat that might be alive or dead, but we cannot know without looking inside the cage. At the same time, the minute we look inside the cage, the cat will be killed by a toxic gas. The bottom line: we can't know the answer. Ever.From there, the movie explores how different people react when confronted with the unknown. Some form prejudices. Some fall back on faith. Some become faithLESS. And some just don't care.This is a beautifully crafted film that shows us the nature of human beings in that respect. No, there's not really a story. But it does even better than that: it challenges our minds to see elements of our own lives within the life of this ordinary schmuck. I am truly amazed at the Coens' accomplishment, and I hope they continue in this direction in the future, though I'm sure it may hurt their mainstream appeal.If you see this film & like it, I think you'll really enjoy the other films I've listed as well as the Hungarian masterpiece ""Werckmeister Harmonies"", anything by Wim Wenders (""The End of Violence"" touches on the same Uncertainty Principle) and Orson Welles' ""The Trial"".",A Serious Man
54,3xHCCH,Like a Strange Nightmarish Dream,6,17 January 2010,"""A Serious Man"" is yes, a serious film. The Coen Brothers have come up with another dark comedy that is definitely going to split the audience.The film is set in suburban Minnesota in 1967. It follows a typical upright everyman, physics professor Larry Gopnik, as he suddenly experiences one misfortune after another, about his unsatisfied wife, disrespectful children, a useless brother, tenure problems, a student who wants to bribe himself out of a failing grade, strange neighbors, etc... Through all of this, Larry sought the advice of rabbis (he is a traditional Jew), but to no avail. To the end, he does not really know nor understand what is happening to his life and why. And nor do we, as the audience.There isn't much of a story arc. It is merely a retelling of unfortunate events, and endless philosophizing about them. For the majority of the world audience unfamiliar with with Judaism, the dialog steeped in Jewish culture and idiom does not make the viewing experience any easier. We can follow what is happening, but nothing is clear when the film ends. The whole two hours is like one of those unusual trippy dreams that Larry experiences. Not everybody could patiently sit through the whole thing.For the positives: The performance of the unknown lead actor Michael Stuhlbarg as Larry is very sympathetic. The technical aspects, especially the camera work, is very good to convey the nightmarish dream-like quality of the film. The exposure to the Jewish culture is interesting, especially the scene of the son's Bar Mitzvah. I definitely like this film more than ""No Country For Old Men,"" but my favorite Coen Brothers film remains to be ""Fargo.""",A Serious Man

56,EUyeshima,The Idiosyncratic Coens Deliver a Most Personal Comedy,8,13 February 2010,"As if they represent two halves of one soul, the Coen brothers definitely have a singular perspective on their films, and this richly idiosyncratic 2009 comedy feels like the most complete manifestation of their conjoined personas. An appreciation for Jewish culture would probably help in watching this film, but as someone who is only familiar with those traditions from late-night viewings of ""Fiddler on the Roof"" and ""Yentl"" on TV, I think the Coens manage to transcend the story's ethnic elements into an entertaining fable about fate and karma in suburban Minneapolis circa 1967, the same place and time when older brother Joel Coen would have been preparing for his bar mitzvah. That rite of passage is meticulously detailed with humor in this tale through bored adolescent Danny Gopnik, who would rather listen to the Jefferson Airplane through his transistor radio earplug.The movie starts unexpectedly in a shtetl somewhere in Eastern Europe back a century or so, when a poor man and his stoic wife are visited on a wintry night by a scholarly rabbi she knows had already died. When the mysterious man appears at their door, she stabs him to prove she's right, that he is a dybbuk, an undead spirit inhabiting the man's body. Flash forward to 1967 and we meet Larry Gopnik, a put-upon Jewish professor of physics surrounded by marijuana-smoking son Danny, constantly agitated daughter Sarah, thoroughly resigned wife Judith, and slovenly brother Arthur who refuses to leave the house as he works on some unwieldy numerological treatise. As Larry awaits approval of his tenure at the university, his life starts to fall apart piece by piece. Judith announces her intention to divorce him to marry their smarmy neighbor Sy Ableman, and he is forced to move to a nearby motel when she empties out their joint bank accounts.A Korean student named Clive insists the failing grade he received from Larry was unfair, and Larry then discovers an envelope with thousands of dollars inside. Pride overcomes temptation initially, but a series of unexpected events make the money more appear more desirable. To stave off his guilt and attempt to understand the root of his difficulties, Larry meets three distinctly different rabbis sequentially to sort out his troubles, but nothing seems to help. Once he makes up his mind about the money, fate seems to intervene again with even more dire consequences. There are no major stars in the cast, and stage actor Michael Stuhlbarg makes an auspicious starring debut effectively showing how Larry's soul slowly unravels despite his Newhart-like, button-down appearance. Perhaps intentionally with his glasses, he looks a lot like silent-screen comedian Harold Lloyd.A sturdy supporting cast complements the execution of the film - sitcom actor Richard Kind (""Mad About You"") as Arthur, sketch performer Sari Lennick as Judith, Aaron Wolff amusingly off-kilter as Danny, an avuncular Adam Arkin (Alan's son) as Larry's attorney, and George Wyner as the rabbi who shares the story of a dentist who notices a Hebrew message inscribed on the back of the teeth of an oblivious customer, a completely Coen-esquire example of how the Hashem works in the most unusual ways. The story's period detail is presented immaculately between Roger Deakins' cinematography, Jess Gonchor's production design, and Mary Zophres' costume design. The 2010 DVD offers a sparse set of extras. There are two featurettes, a twenty-minute making-of short about the production and the Coens' childhood basis for their movie, and a ten-minute tour of the film's locations. There is also a tiny Hebrew/Yiddish glossary to help you through some of the terms used.",A Serious Man

I really can understand why many viewers might seriously not get the humor here. But as an Anglo Catholic bought up on a diet of Woody Allen, Billy Crystal and the Coen comedies...well, I thought this was hilarious. In 1977 I clearly remember mainstream audiences not appreciating ANNIE HALL especially when it drew them in via the Oscar wins and I am revisiting that feeling with A SERIOUS MAN. Maybe if you appreciated NEIGHBOURS from 1982 (Belushi) or THE ICE STORM you might connect with the vicious suburban lives explored here. A SERIOUS MAN has a Danny Thomas Show bent to it... it looks like a 50s/60s sitcom like FATHER KNOWS BEST and then tosses a cyclone of family disasters and misunderstandings and confusions at this hapless every-Jew. If you are not up on your circumcised life lesson comedy, A SERIOUS MAN might have serious misgivings for you. If like me you can deal with Jewish angst and family disasters, then you will enjoy.

This is the same feelings we have with many people we meet & know.

59,Enchorde,A non-movie,5,10 January 2011,"Recap: Larry Gopnik is a physics professor at the local college, and a father of two. He also one that absolutely everyone steps on. His wife wants a divorce, to go live with an old friend of his, Sy. Sy wants Larry to arrange the divorce, and pay for it. His neighbor is building a boat house on his property. The rabbis at the synagogue won't bother and his brother Arthur, well he has some serious problems of his own. Someone is slandering about him at work. And his son is complaining that the television reception is bad. Poor Larry just struggles to get by Comment: The Coen brothers are talented writers and directors, especially the kind low key comedies that turn on the absurd. But usually they are much more successful than this. A Serious Man is not much of a comedy, it's just a drama about a man that draws the short straw on every possible deal. It's almost kind of sad.I expected a lot more of a Coen movie, this lacks the ingenuity their movies usually has. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good either. It didn't say very much, nor add anything. It was not very entertaining, so for a lack of better description, it just was.5/10",A Serious Man
60,dierregi,The Coen brothers hate humankind,1,30 January 2010,"In a nutshell, the movie takes place in the 60's, in a very American/Jewish neighborhood. If I was Jewish I probably would take offense, because almost all the characters in the movie are unbearable for one reason or another. However, the Coen brothers are equal opportunities offenders and even if this movie concentrates on a Jewish environment, their other movies are generously filled with deepest contempt for all humankind, regardless of race, sex, nationality or religion.The main character is a physician named Larry who is passive, meek and spineless beyond credibility. Or maybe that was supposed to be funny. Anyway, lots of bad things happen to Larry, but I found it difficult to sympathize with him. Besides being unaware of his surroundings and the people around him to the point of autism, Larry is also seeking answers to the wrong questions in places where he cannot find any.Bad things happen to good people for no reason whatsoever. We should all be acquainted with this disagreeable truth. However, humankind struggles hard to find a meaning in life. Unfortunately, searching for meaning to understand tragic events usually leads to absurd explanations and an even heavier burden of frustration.This is what happens to Larry, but who cares? Certainly not me. As mentioned, he is almost completely detached from reality, so obviously he does not have a clue. But not only we have to follow Larry stumbling around like a blind man. To increase the indignity of the show, we are presented with a gallery of supporting characters, one more grotesque, ugly and disgusting than the other.Actually, I can't think of a single character in this movie without an emotional or physical problem (or both). The full range of indignities includes an obese woman mercilessly shown shuffling her feet and struggling to move her heavy body; a string of the senior citizens chewing on their teeth less mouths and loosing track of what they are saying; a bunch of foul-mouthed teenagers, selfishly self-absorbed and focused only in bullying each other; a couple of sluttish housewives; a stupid red-neck neighbor; a bald, fat guy suffering from some sort of embarrassing skin disease; etc. I am sure Diane Arbus would have been impressed with this gallery of monsters. Me, not so much.And here is where I find the deal breaker with the Coen brother's filmography. There is not a single one of their movies that does not present a gallery of every-day freaks. People with grotesque physical and mental imperfections do exist, but they seem to inhabit the Coen universe in an exceeding large number, and I find the display of so much freakishness rather disturbing. Besides, I might agree about the fact that there is no meaning in life, but when I go to the cinema I want to see a good movie, I do not want to be patronized or to follow a philosophy lesson.",A Serious Man

I saw this movie three times in theaters (it was free due to my employment at the theater, but still, that's a lot of time to spend with Larry Gopnik), and every time I was amazed by the new details I picked up... I also came to thoroughly enjoy watching the audience's reactions as the film came to a close, when, almost invariably, someone in the crowd would mutter disappointedly, ""That was it?"" while I sat there grinning ear to ear.",A Serious Man

It's an engaging character study, great script, some impressive story ideas, true to the period, brilliant casting and terrific performances. It captures an important historical moment, and although its ultimate message is more one of something like 'alas that's life', it does seek to higher its moral ground as a work of art and a look at society norms, not that much different from today, if at all.

A Serious Man, however, is the Coens at their (in my opinion) best. It mixes dark and often cruel humour, with a realistic, if exaggerated, look at humanity. A Serious Man is a film that takes on difficult themes, as they are hard to display satisfactorily. ""Shit happens"" and ""Does it matter?"" seem to be the main points the film wishes to express. If there is a God or higher power, why does he do/allow bad things to happen? Just because. He doesn't have to answer to you. A cast of mostly unrecognizables, help create a fantastic and witty view of late 60's Jewish life. The Coens also give us stories with no real conclusion, as the story of the dentist represents an interesting and engaging tale, without a dramatic climax. Sometimes the journey is more satisfactory than the finale. Such is life, which can end at any moment. Bad things are going to happen, and sometimes there's no reason, or way to stop them.",A Serious Man

65,Galina_movie_fan,"""Uncertainty Principle proves we can't ever really know... what's going on. So it shouldn't bother you.""",10,25 July 2015,"It's been mentioned many times that A Serious Man (2009) is a retelling of the Book of Job. It very well could be - as only Coen Brothers could adapt the Biblical story to the screen. They placed Job, the Schlimazel of the Old Testament in Minnesota suburbia of their own adolescent. They named him Larry Gopnik, made him a physics professor in a local college, a nice, loving, and pious man, and let him watch hopelessly how his life was collapsing around him while he tried to make sense of what and why was happening to him and desperately sought after a spiritual help from his religious advisers, three rabbis - in vain. A Serious Man is not an autobiographical movie but it is set in the very atmosphere and spirit where two Coen boys grew up in the year 1967, the exact year Joel Coen turned 13 and was preparing for his own bar mitzvah - just like Danny Gopnik, 13 years old pot smoking Jefferson Airplane fan Larry's son whose Bar Mitzvah in the movie is a truly unforgettable event for many reasons. Now, as the experienced celebrated filmmakers who have proved (at least for this viewer) to be among THE best modern filmmakers, Coens look back at the place and time that shaped them as individuals, men, and creative personalities, and they ask eternal and often impossible to answer questions. Does life have meaning? What is the point of it? Or is there point at all? Why do bad things happen to a decent person who ""did not do anything""? Is there any certainty in life or all we can do just accept the fact there is no explanation, no certainty, and no fairness, and the best is - ""to receive with simplicity everything that happens to you."" I can understand how this film may be puzzling and even disappointing for many viewers even among the fans. A Serious Man is different and original even for Coens, always innovative and creative artists, but it is undeniably and unmistakably, their film, with their finger prints all over. Take for example the opening scene, the black/white prologue spoken in Yiddish and set somewhere in Eastern Europe back in the 19th or 18th century, in a small Shtetl. It involves a married couple and their mysterious visitor who could be a dybbuck, an evil spirit, believed to be the dislocated soul of a dead person. The scene certainly would stay with a viewer and make them try to understand its meaning. As one explanation, the husband and wife could be the ancestors of Larry Gopnik before his family immigrated to the USA and ended up in Minnesota. The encounter with the dybbuk could bring the curse to the future generations, and that may explain all assortment of ""tsuris"" that poor Larry tries to deal with. Coen's explained that they wanted to include a folk tale to set the tone in the film that explores among many things Jewish traditions, religion, faith, and character. They could not find a tale they'd like, so they wrote one and made a very stylish, ominously dark yet funny and mysterious opening to their film. As a perfect balance to the fairytale/ghost story opening, the final scene comes that literally can blow you away. As it has happened before in a Coens 'movie , the open ending has as many admirers as haters but I believe it was no other way to finish the film, and I found the ending perfect in the universe that Coens create. The brothers' decision to cast mostly unknown stage actors in the main roles, proved to be successful one, and everyone was up to their job. Michael Stuhlbarg positively shines as Larry and he makes one of the most sympathetic characters in Coens' movie. Sari Lennick, Richard Kind, Fred Melamed as a seriously creepy man whom Larry's wife Judith wanted to leave Larry for as well as the rest of the cast are all memorable. The camera work by Roger Deakins', the longtime collaborator of Coens in recreating the long gone era of the late 60s in the Middle of America is above any praise. A Serious Man is beautiful, profound, and perfectly well made. It is funny, too. Seriously.",A Serious Man
66,framptonhollis,a masterpiece of black humor,10,21 January 2017,"The Coen Brothers are masters of their craft. Few filmmakers today can combine genres, produce stunningly original stories, and master every aspect of cinematic technique like they can. ""A Serious Man"" is among their most recent efforts, and it is also among their greatest.It's a black comedy that relies more on character and situation than actual plot (somewhat like another darkly humorous Coens masterpiece, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"") that focuses around a middle aged Jewish father and husband whose life transforms into a storm of chaos and really, REALLY bad luck. Here, the Coens wonderfully weave elements of hilarious humor and gut wrenching tragedy all at once. Some scenes are both sad and funny, and the Coens are such masters that these two genres to not clash together in a chaotic way, but, instead, a very natural, effective way. The Coens realize that even when life is at its absolute worse, it can still be hilarious-which is really the essence of dark humor within itself. It makes the worst, most miserable aspects of being funny.There is no real happy ending here, much is left unresolved. It is a mysterious ending, the type that audiences like to groan at. However, for a film as unique and dark as this it works quite well. There is no need for a resolution, the ending itself is powerful enough to conclude the fascinating fable. The final shot of this film is so beautiful, haunting, and indescribably sad it packs a punch for the ages.",A Serious Man
67,p-stepien,Obscurily lost in the point,5,3 February 2011,"""A Serious Man"", an awkward ode to Jewishness in all its simplicity of wackiness, must probably be Coen's closest dash into obscurity epitomised by a very wacky opening scene. Focused on the life and times of Jewish mathematician prof. Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) it tells a simple tale in a very convoluted package. Flirting with madness Gopnik must cope with a plethora of troubles of varying scale focusing within a time-span of two weeks. Amongst them his wife has decided to leave him for a goodie-two-shoes old friend, his brother has issues with gambling and sodomy, whilst a Korean college student tries to persuade the professor to grant him a passing grade using any means necessary. Meanwhile his son is preparing for Bar Mitzvah.As in most Coen movies the simple and seemingly insignificant character choices cause a cascade chain reaction, which can either save or damn the given person. In this movie however the key choice is prolonged up until the very end, whilst in between we see the whole process, where a seemingly happy married man discovers his detachment from family, friends and realises the detachment and inability of his faith to assist him in his dire straits. All mixed in with multiple more or less pointless scenes, characters and situations. Some of them do add pizazz to the story, others just manage to distract and fuzzy up the message. And herein lies the essential problem: Is there a point to all this? As in most Coen movies this question lingers, but overall morality and wit of the story lets you gloss over any doubts and just gobble up the whole package with love and admiration. In ""A Serious Man"" the ultimate duo do seem to present some point, but it all gets so bungled up in the multitude of insignificant occurrences, that by the time the end credits roll you aren't really sure and you don't really care. But than again the point of this movie was that there is no point to anything... As Gopnik strives for answers he manages to find none, hence he bounces from situation to situation, until an abrupt and pointless end. All this sandwiched in elaborations on the uncertainty principle. Nonetheless I fathom to ask whether it was impossible to present the above within a story populated with more worthwhile characters and interesting occurrences?The movie is undoubtedly a decent watch and even though it dabbles into obscure Jewish rituals, which mean nothing for the average viewer, it managed to keep you entertained with several characters and scenes really turning up the laughter volume. Unfortunately the movie's most interesting character, who manages to garner several laughs during his scenes, doesn't last for very long and even he was unsympathetic. And that is another issue. There is something about Jewish self-portrayal, which sometimes makes me think, that they don't seem to like themselves. Although you never expect a Manichean cast in a Coen movie it does seem awkward and becomes essentially irritating when every single character in the movie is a version of Woody Allen (albeit no-one is so neurotic). In the end I failed to care for either the dish-dashing story or any of the myriad of characters presented. Apart from maybe the inarticulate Korean student, who was just so sweet in his audaciousness. All in all my least enjoyable Coen movie, which I personally believe deserves none of the accolades of their general genius of work.",A Serious Man
68,Matt_Layden,Horribly Boring Effort From The Coens,5,11 February 2010,"Larry's life seems to be falling a part. His wife wants a divorce, his kids don't pay any attention to him or respect him, his brother is always in trouble with the law, he is having nightmares and medical tests and finally a student has bribed him for a passing grade. An avid Coen fan, I looked forward to this one. Wanting something a bit more to chew into than the soft effort that was Burn After Reading. Unfortunately I got a boring story that drags every chance it gets. Add to the fact that the Coen's have their own weird spin on things and like to play with the audiences perceptions, I knew I was going to be left unsatisfied by the films ending. Of course it turns out that way too.A Serious Man has some great performances, specifically from the lead Michael Stuhlbarg. If it weren't for his unique pathetic charm, I might have disliked this film more than I did. My main problem is that is full of nothingness. I get that there will be fans who love it because of this, but since loving or hating a film is all based on opinion, I happy to say that this film does nothing for me.Coen's don't fall under any specific thumb. It's hard to pin point them, especially after they give us this weird film. I guess this is black comedy in it's true form. Are the Coen's too good to give us another Big Lebowski? Are they on auto pilot now after winning their Best Picture Oscar? Am I suppose to laugh at how this guy's life is falling apart before him? Am I suppose to laugh at the punch line ending to the film that feels like one long joke?Connecting the ending of the film to the story that the one rabbi gave Larry is not hard, but does it make it smart? Not in my opinion. It gets me angry. The film solves nothing and gives us nothing. It feels like a waste of time. I can't hate the film too much though, it's well directed and well written. I just wish that it had more for me to get into, more for me to want to get into. It felt like it was just there with no substance.

From the (brilliant) stand-alone folktale at the beginning, to the vague and terrifying final shot, A Serious Man forces Larry's experiences into the life of the viewer, and vice-versa.

71,bandw,Searching for answers,8,5 October 2010,"Larry Gopnik is a physics professor at a mid-western university, it is 1967. Poor Larry seems to be a modern stand-in for the Biblical Job. He is a good person who tries to do the right things, but events conspire against him. Part of Larry's problem is that he is the type of person that people don't take seriously--he is just there. For example, when he goes up on his roof to adjust the TV antenna in response to his teenage son's complaint that he can't receive a desired channel, Larry gets no thanks.Among Larry's problems: his wife announces she wants a divorce so she can marry one of his friends, Sy Ableman; he has an anti-semitic neighbor who is planning to violate set-back requirements in placing an out building near his property; his useless brother-in-law (whose main activities seem to be occupying the bathroom and draining a cyst on his neck) is living with his family; he has a student who tries to bribe him for a passing grade and later threatens to sue if Larry refuses this and alerts the authorities; he is up for tenure in front of a committee that informs him ""not to worry,"" but they have been getting anonymous letters of denigration; the results of a medical exam are in question. And so forth.In the face of such adversity Larry seeks help from his Rabbis and his lawyer. If you have ever sought help from such people you will appreciate the dark satirization here of the anemic advice often dispensed. These scenes are exaggerated for effect, but they capture the exasperated despair one feels when his concerns are not being taken seriously by moral leaders, or when he is charged large sums for worthless legal advice. To Larry's credit he never abandons hope, but persists in trying to resolve life's problems as a serious, rational man.I loved the scenes with Sy Ableman. Most of us have known such a person--one who sticks it to you in the guise of cheerful camaraderie. Fred Melamed plays Sy so perfectly that you wonder what he is like in real life.This film starts with a short segment, filmed in a 4:3 aspect ratio, that appears to take place in 19th century Russia. I will leave it to more sophisticated viewers to figure out why this is in there, but the main effect it had on me was to wonder if I had received the wrong DVD.One of the DVD extras gives definitions for some Jewish terms used in the movie.

Yes I get that the brothers are totally enthralled by their mid-western Jewish upbringing and wanted to bring it to the big screen. And the cinematography and effects of 1967 are superbly captured. All that was needed was a script. And characters for the viewer to care about.This viewer never got emotionally involved with any of the characters. I found an edge of nastiness to most of the dialogue, even cruelty. No one cares about anyone else. There is very little story line - the basics are a physics professor who is so disengaged from his domestic life that he's not aware his wife is having an affair with a friend and wants a kosher divorce. Throw in many other characters, an eccentric brother, several rabbis, scenes that go nowhere (the chaotic formula of life being a deep riddle and all that stuff) a filler of an extremely irritating and poorly acted short film at the beginning of the movie which has no bearing on the main movie and that's about it.The DVD has the usual self-congratulatory cameos by all involved preening patronizingly at us and at each other.2 out of 10.",A Serious Man
74,Screen_Blitz,Darkly funny and genuinely well worth effort with thought-provoking themes,8,17 February 2016,"From the director and writers Joel and Ethan Coen comes another a film that can only be described as darkly hilarious, or perhaps hilariously serious; a film shined by magnificent performances, crafty writing, and some thought-provoking themes on the Jewish culture. Set in the late 1960s, Michael Stuhlbarg stars as Larry Gopnik, a Jewish physics professor at a Minnesota University who finds his life falling apart around him, his wife Judy (played by Sari Lennick) is cheating on him with an old friend Sy Ableman (played by Fred Selamed), his mischievous son Danny (played by Aaron Wolff) is debt of twenty dollars he owes for marijuana he hides from his parents, his daughter Sarah (played by Jessica McManus) is secretly stealing money from him to save up for a nose job, and his older brother Arthur (played by Richard Kind) is left jobless and stuck sleeping on their couch. With his job in jeopardy and his son's bar mitzvah approaching, Larry tries make sense of the unfortunate events going on his life.This Coen brothers pulls off an interesting feat, and it involves being a film for people not to take lightly nor take too seriously. Likewise to many of the Coen brothers' works, this film holds a solid balance of a dark story with touches of humor, witty dialogue, and nifty caricatures. What the directors bring new to the table however, is some themes dealing with faith and religion. Judaism plays a major role in the story as the main character and his family are devout Jewish. His son attends Hebrew school and has a bar mitzvah approaching. But when his life starts making a turn for the worse, he begins to question his faith, and the idea raises many questions about the Jewish culture. A good example plays during a shocking dream sequence with the main character and his brother Arthur when Arthur is boating away in a lake while saying good-bye to his brother, and another one in a scene during Danny's bar mitzvah. The concept is well written by a decent screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen who manage to bless the story of an engaging approach, enough to leave viewers asking questions about the Jewish culture. The best aspect of the film comes not from the directors' sweet approach to their colorful themes, but the brilliant performance by Michael Stuhlbarg. He is very committed and funny in his role, he brings plenty of unexpected humor and somberness to his performance. The story is at least at the level of his performance. Though sometimes loses its touch occasionally, the Coen brothers do not fail to keep things moving, and by the end, will leave viewers ready for either serious discussions, or smiling at the glamor of the directors' immersive style.A Serious Man is a well worth effort by the Coen brothers, and something I believe every Coen brothers fan would genuinely enjoy. The film is very well acted, brilliantly shot, and guided by an intensely clever screenplay full of style, wit, and humor. Their genuine works serves a good reminder of why these directors are the influential directors they are today.",A Serious Man

Leaning heavily on only the drama genre, this still has lots of typical Coen elements, such as black humour, a keen sense of (cinematographic) style and loads of intriguing characters. It is also the first time the Coens bring in their Jewish roots into a film this literally. I can't say I know all about this culture, but ever since I read a series of short stories by Isaac Bashevis Singer, I've been a 'fan'. The opening story of 'A serious man' very much reminded me of such a short story, by the way.Before I get into the serious issues of the film: it was great fun seeing Stephen Park (Mike Yanagita in 'Fargo'), Michael Lerner (Jack Lipnik in 'Barton Fink') and Katherine Borowitz (Ann Nirdlinger in 'The man who wasn't there') again, even if their roles were tiny.

76,Sirus_the_Virus,"A seriously funny, dramatic, clever, and real film.",10,7 February 2010,"Michael Stuhlbarg stars as a man with an unfortunate life in A serious man, the newest film from Joel and Ethan Cohen. The masterminds behind No country for old men, and Fargo. Usually in a Cohen brother's film they cast big celebrities. A serious man only has one celebrity that I could recognize. In most movies I won't give them a chance if there aren't any celebrities in it. If you are that way, trust me, you won't have a problem with A serious man.There aren't many celebrities obviously. The only one I could recognize was Richard Kind from Spin city as the lead character's brother. He's not even the best actor in thew film. Remember the name Michael Stuhlbarg. This is an excellent actor trust me. A serious man has a lot to it. It's been nominated for best picture. I would be very glad if it won it.The Gopnik family has been cursed for many years. As it shows in the beginning. Larry Gopnik(played excellently by Michael Stuhlbarg)has a terrible life. None of his family really likes him. They just use him for cash. Or his kids do. His brother Arthur9played by Richard Kind) is mooching off of him and has a gambling problem secretly. His son is in Hebrew school cause of his Barmitzva coming up. His daughter just complains about everything.Larry watches his life crumble apart when his wife decides to leave him. Do to his brother living there. His wife is having an affair also. There is more going on in the plot, but I can't spoil it. A serious man is The Cohen's best film since Fargo. There are many weird moments in this film. Like in pretty much all of The Cohen Borther's films. The film is also fantastic, like most of The Cohen brother's films. A serious man is hilarious, at times very dramatic, and you got to see it.A Serious man: A",A Serious Man
77,Philby-3,Like the Coen style? You'll like this,8,23 November 2009,"If one was to describe the output of the Coen brothers over the past 25 years in two words they would be ""eclectic"" and ""idiosyncratic"". This time they have reached into their own pasts and come up with a serio-comedy set in 1967 in which a Jewish mathematics professor in a small college in Minnesota suffers a series of misfortunes reminiscent of those of Job. He's up for tenure but someone is writing anonymous hate letters to the college about him, a Korean student tries to bribe him for a passing grade, his son is getting into trouble just as the time for his bar-mitzvah arrives, his wife announces she is leaving him for an old friend, the oily Sy Abelman, his redneck next door neighbour is encroaching on his property, another neighbour seems bent on seducing him, and he is involved in a car crash. God sure has piled it on, but ""why oh why"" Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) cries. He seeks answers from a series of increasingly comic Rabbis but of course they have none. In the end... well, you will have to see for yourself, but the Coen brothers aren't in for pat endings.The spirit of Woody Allen is in there somewhere, but the Coens are a lot less self-obsessed than Woody and their characters more comic than his. They use very experienced and capable actors from the second rank, many with long experience in television, and this ensures that the actorial ego does not get in the way of the material. I'm not sure how autobiographical all this is (I wasn't even aware Minneapolis has a big enough Jewish population to support a Jewish high school, let alone a college) and I can see some Jews might regard the portrayal of some characters as offensive, but really Larry is everyman confronted by the fickle finger of fate; being Jewish gives his trials and tribulations a context.I have absolutely no idea where the prologue, in which a Jewish peasant couple in the Poland of 100 years ago have an encounter with a wandering spirit, fits in with the rest of the story except that it illustrates one way of dealing with threats, but it is very amusing nonetheless. If you generally like the Coen style you will enjoy this movie; stay away if you do not share their brand of eclectic and idiosyncratic humour.",A Serious Man
78,sharky_55,"I'm studying Torah, asshole.",9,23 December 2015,"The aspect ratio is almost square, and the frame's edges are vignetted and fading into brown, rendering the tale like an old wrinkled story on paper, but nothing more. The wife plunges an icepick into Groshkover's chest, and as he bleeds, he proves her superstitions wrong. He is not in fact a dybbuk, and here is concrete proof right in front of her, but she is unswayed. Tradition trumps logic, and later, as Larry is dwarfed by the enormous mathematical proofs of his blackboard, he wrestles with both sides, and even a man of his knowledge is perplexed by the universe and how it works. He tries his hardest to be a serious man, thinking that it will reward him, but is much more a Kafkaesque figure, buffeted continually by things out of his control, looking for meaning where there is not necessarily meaning to be found. His own journey is mirrored by the chaos around him, and in particular by his son, whom does not seem to take Hebrew school seriously and is using his money for marijuana. The opening cross-cuts between the pair; extreme close-up of his ear listening to his walkman versus Larry at an inspection, one in nervous anticipation and one in careless abandon. As he is deep in concern and consultation, Danny punctures it with a phonecall, but it isn't something deep or meaningful: F Troop is still fuzzy, the cable needs fixing. His dialogue is laced with unholy profanities that Larry would be embarrassed at, and during a sacred and pivotal moment of his life, his bar mitzvah, Deakins shoots the ceremony with compressed depth of field and dutch angles, because he is of course high, and not taking it very seriously. Stuhlbarg is excellent. Here is a man that is by all means good. Here is someone who politely questions why it should be him to move out when his wife wants a divorce, and cannot even vehemently deny that a show he once saw was somewhat erotic. On the roof, he stares all around at the cookie-cutter suburbia and pristine lawns and wonders what exactly it all means (and if it is worth it - every time he steps into his home he is assaulted with a cacophony of problems), and spots a naked sun-lounger, something that he feels he should not be looking at. But then he convinces himself to visit on some guise of neighbourly assistance, and even then, with all the suggestions, he can only go so far in his dreams. The world is affectionately 60s. There is a gun-nut neighbour, whom Larry worries about his anti-Semitism and his violent tendencies. A record club repeatedly tries to receive payment, and poor Larry cannot even bear to lie or trick them. Heart attack or car crash, those really happened. There is the aforementioned hussy neighbour, who slinkers through a beaded curtain and offers a glass of ice-tea (and I wager in Larry's mind, it is even more seductive than this). And there is a tightly knit Jewish community. Everyone from dentists to lawyers are family friendly - even a police officer curiously blurts out ""Who died?"". They treat the deceased Sy Ableman with reverence, but not too much of it (""Esther is barely cold!""). Melamed's performance is also great; his voice purrs out insincere platitudes, his outstretched hand offers unwelcome invasions of personal space, he haunts Larry in his dreams, and beneath it all, writes vicious anonymous letters hoping to discredit him. A Serious Man's most impressive achievement is the picture it paints of a certain religious mindset. They appeal to the masses because they offer orientation and knowledge and answers to the why questions, and the followers begin to form a type of entitlement towards their Hashem; they must know the meaning of life. Why is my wife leaving me? Why is my brother being arrested? Who is sending letters defaming my career? What is going on? Larry relentlessly pursues meaning. The first rabbi is young, inexperienced, and offers little more than metaphors and platitudes. The second has resigned all authority, and instead tells a intriguing yet ultimately pointless story. The third, said to be the oldest and wisest of them all, merely offers Jefferson Airplane lyrics, a simple piece of advice, and returns a confiscated item of value. The title cards, and the dramatic music seem to indicate importance, but they unveil none. Larry is earnestly trying his best to be a serious man, even as he is uncertain if it really works. Religious figures in fiction are rarely this nuanced, but I suspect a great deal of them in reality are much like Larry. And yes, they occasionally waver from complete moral goodness. Only in the Coen universe, this means tornadoes, destruction and cancer. Job was rewarded with a completely new wife and sons and daughters, and even new livestock. I suppose God is wondering how Larry will face this crisis, and quietly musing to himself, much like Rabbi Nachter: ""First I should tell you, then I shouldn't.""",A Serious Man
79,aciessi,Seriously Good.,9,19 March 2018,"Only the Coen bros. could think of something as marvelous as taking the opening lyrics of ""Somebody to Love"" by Jefferson Airplane and turning them into a Jewish proverb. Somehow, after an hour and a half of pure mishegas from the perspective of a real schlemiel, those lyrics sounded just right coming from Rabbi Marshak. A Serious Man was most notably a surprise dark horse nomination for Best Picture in 2009. In most award-seasons, A Serious Man is the kind of film that you'd wish was nominated in every category.It's a humble project for the Coens, but don't ever underestimate what they can do. A Serious Man is a serious picture that makes you laugh and squirm at the misfortune of Larry Gopnik. An average mid-western Jewish man searching for reason in a time where there is none. Tested is he to make peace with HaShem when all around him is moral decay and temptation. The Coens strength is in their characters, which in this film are as rich as they've ever been. I was fascinated by Arthur Gopnik, a borderline autistic man who discovers a map of the universe while tending to his sebaceous cyst. Perhaps my favorite character was Sy Ableman, a self proclaimed ""serious man"" from the community who Larry's wife is cheating on him with. His purposely affected anglo-saxon accent nearly killed me. It's the littlest eccentricities of people that the Coens always explore and exploit and it's eternally delightful.",A Serious Man
80,TOMASBBloodhound,"Life sucks, then things get even worse.",7,11 March 2017,"This is a skillfully crafted, yet ultimately impenetrable film that will not be for all audiences. For my money, Coen brothers film really run a wide gamut in terms of how good they are. You have some spectacular efforts (No Country for Old Men, Fargo), some very good efforts (Raising Arizona, Blood Simple.), overrated fare (Big Lebowski), and some downright tedious (Burn After Reading). A Serious Man would rate above average in terms of the Coen catalog. It is funny, dark, richly-textured, but it really ends abruptly and doesn't seem to have a specific point. Beware that this review is written by a ""goy"", and much of the Jewish symbolism and possible inside pool are unknown to me.After a Yiddish prologue that takes place in a Jewish village many years prior to the main events of the film, we are then introduced to man with many, many problems living in late 1960s Minnesota. The Coens' own upbringing is obviously the inspiration for the world this man, Larry Gupnick lives in. He seems like your average mild- mannered college physics professor, and that's exactly what he is. But for reasons we never really understand, EVERYTHING bad that could happen seems to be happening to him. His wife is leaving him for a pompous widower, his children are ingrates, an Asian student is attempting to bribe him and accuse him of defamation all at once, a neighbor is encroaching on his property, an annoying relative has moved in.... you name it. Is this all a punishment from God? If so, why? Who can he turn to for help? Lawyers? Too expensive, considering his wife has emptied their bank account. The rabbis of their synagogue? They talk in circles, and don't seem capable of offering any helpful advice. All we are left to do as an audience is feel sorry for Larry. But we are basically left in the dark as to what he has done, if anything, to deserve it all.The film is an interesting character study, but where it really shines is in the detail of its production design. Its as if the Coens took every detail from all of their family albums or home movies and crafted a world for these characters that only someone who lived in this environment could have captured. I love No Country for Old Men, but even that film did not convince me it was happening in 1980. They did much better this time around. The son's bar mitzvah ceremony (while he was stoned) is perhaps the film's most memorable scene, and probably based on one of the most memorable events of their own lives. Overall, a very good but mysterious film. Coen fans will appreciate it a lot more than casual viewers. Don't expect to figure out the meaning of life by the time the credits roll, however. 7 of 10 stars. The Hound.",A Serious Man
81,Danusha_Goska,Slight Movie; Exaggerated Press,4,10 October 2010,"I heard a lot about ""A Serious Man"" before I saw the movie. The Village Voice, in a scathing review, condemned it as anti-Semitic; others praised it as the best thing since the Book of Job. I didn't see either ""Serious Man"" – I didn't see the Village Voice's anti-Semitic film, and I also didn't see the masterpiece Coen Brothers groupies insist, against all evidence, that this film is.""A Serious Man"" has style to burn, and little substance. The Coen Brothers' production team worked very hard to recreate the look of a Midwestern suburb in 1967, and their success is breathtakingly evident. During opening scenes, I wasn't caring about the paper-thin characters or the plot that could be summed up in one boring sentence fragment – bad things happen to a man the film's directors don't care about – rather I was obsessed with the fly-in-amber 1967-era suburb the Coens were able to recreate in what is obviously a low-budget film. The pristine, uniform, lawns, the blindingly white, crackless sidewalks, the vintage cars, the skyline absent of the crowns of mature trees, the spotless just-moved-in look of the homes, really do strike you. Sadly, the surface of this film is much more impressive than anything else going on on screen.Michael Stuhlbarg, a stage actor I've never seen in anything else, is poignant as Larry Gopnik, a married, suburban dad and physics professor experiencing a run of bad luck. In spite of the Coens' signature coldness and sadism, I actually cared about Larry. I fervently wished that he, and Stuhlbarg, were in a much better movie. The Coens' complete absence of investment in Larry leaves you, the viewer, free to laugh at the sadistic traps they set for him. I did laugh when Larry's torpedo-shaped wife brusquely demands a divorce, and when her lover forces a hug on Larry and presents him with a bottle of wine. Secondary characters were also amusing, often stereotypically so. There's the icebox frigid Korean student, with the incongruous name of Clive, and the comical rabbis. Rabbi Scott is eager as a bunny but too young and unsure; Rabbi Nachtner is older, arrogant, and all too sure of himself. The jokes are funny and, edited down, this could have been a rewarding thirty minute film. It's padded out, though, and the film goes well past the point where the Coens ran out of ideas. Fans struggle to apply meaning to the film's opening, a pointless excursion to a sort of low-budget, high school production of a shtetl tale the Coens invented themselves. The movie itself goes off the rails and starts dramatizing Larry's dreams, none of which has any point that hasn't already been made.I think the real headscratching, slightly funny, slightly heartbreaking, slightly Ashkenazi fable around ""A Serious Man"" is not so much the film itself; the film itself is rather flimsy and shallow. Rather, what's noteworthy about this film is fan reaction to it. Read fan reviews: you must understand Schrodinger's Cat in order to understand this film! You must understand the Talmud to understand this film! You must understand a recently discovered, highly cryptic, 1905 email that Albert Einstein sent to Sholem Aleichem in order to understand this film! You get the idea. Hardcore Coen fans insist on seeing depth in what is a very shallow, half-baked movie. I suspect that these fans experience a movie the way some might experience doing a jigsaw puzzle while stoned and while working their way through the required reading list of an elite college for precocious, but troubled, boys.Finally, the Book of Job, allegedly the inspiration for ""A Serious Man,"" is actually a magnificent work of literature. ""A Serious Man"" never so much as touches it.",A Serious Man
82,ajs-10,Interesting...,7,24 October 2010,"I'll admit to being a bit of a fan of the Coen brothers' work, particularly their early works. This one well, I'm not too sure about. I know it has been critically acclaimed and deservedly so; it's a very well written script and a very well made movie. But more of my thoughts later, here's a short summary first (summary haters please omit the next paragraph).The setting is Bloomington Minnesota 1967 where Prof. Lawrence 'Larry' Gopnik is a mathematics professor. He has a wife, Judith, and two teenage children, Danny and Sarah. Also staying with them, temporarily, is his brother, Uncle Arthur. Larry goes about his boring daily routine, Danny's bar-mitzvah is coming up and he is also up for tenure at the university. One day Judith comes to him and tells him she wants a divorce. Things are not going well between them and she has become close to another man, Sy Ableman. On top of that a South Korean student is not happy about his mid-term grade and is trying to bribe him to give a pass. Judith and Sy force him out of the house had he has to take Arthur and live in a Motel. Everything seems to be going wrong for Larry. Maybe the Rabbi's have an answer, but getting to see the right one is proving more than difficult.There is a very slow and deliberate pace to this movie. This allows the audience to absorb the dialogue and subtleties woven into the plot. Great performances all round, particularly from Michael Stuhlbarg as Prof. Lawrence 'Larry' Gopnik, Richard Kind as Uncle Arthur and Fred Melamed as Sy Ableman. Honourable mentions go to; Sari Lennick as Judith, Aaron Wolff as Danny and Jessica McManus as Sarah.There was a lot in the movie I didn't understand. Lots of references to things that a follower of the Jewish faith might understand, but not your average person, or 'goy'. This, I found a bit distracting. Also, I felt there was no resolution at the end of the film, a habit the Coens have got into recently. The combination of these two factors made the film slightly disappointing for me, but still, recommended.My score: 7.4/10",A Serious Man
83,gelman@attglobal.net,You don't have to be Jewish,8,17 January 2010,"Several media reviews have called ""A Serious Man"" the Coen brothers most Jewish film. But that's an under-description. ""A Serious Man"" is entirely Jewish and, while you don't need to be Jewish to enjoy it, I'm not sure you'll get it if you're not. Like many other of Ethan and Joel's films, ""A Serious Man"" is freighted with symbolism -- with specifically Jewish symbolism, starting with the opening scene (set in the Old Country) and seemingly unconnected with what follows. Is the visitor who comes to the old couple's house a Dybbuk? Why does the wife stab him to drive him away? What had that got to do with Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlberg), a Jewish college professor suffering the trials of Job in a Minnesota suburb? In fact, why is Gopnik so much of a zhlob as to allow the collapse of his marriage and the threat to his professional career to proceed as if he were entirely at the mercy of others and of events he does not comprehend? Why are the rabbis to whom he turns for advice such caricatures of religious counselors? Does Larry believe that his suffering emanates from God? Does he really think the fools he consults might have the answers?In short, what are the Coen brothers actually up to in this particular film?

His wife and a horrible neighbor named Sy Ableman have an affair and manipulate him terribly. Sy Ableman gets what he deserves, but poor Larry still ends up saddled with the consequence. people seem to make unreasonable demands on Larry from all sides. his students, daughter, brother, all lean on him to the point that would break a strong man, which Larry is not, just a serious and somewhat dull one. even son Danny calls him up on the phone while he is with his lawyer to complain about the TV reception during F-Troop. and all this may, or may not, have been brought on by a family curse.Joel and Ethan Coen are some of mainstream commercial film's most reliable artist. they've never made a bad film. even their first low budget B-film comedy 'Crimewave' was hilarious. this film is one of their best. many Coen brother films can be big and extravagant,'Lebowski','Hudsucker Proxy', but this was very modest and did not feature big name stars. those are the kind of films I often like best.This film was insightful and real. mainstream film making should make more films like this.",A Serious Man

No John Goodman, no Frances McDormand, no Steve Buscemi, and no John Turturro. It's also one of their least known films. But do not be fooled. A Serious Man is one of their best films. Physics professor Larry Gopnik's (Michael Stuhlbarg) life has just taken a whole bunch of turns for the worse. His wife Judith Gopnik (Sari Lennick) is leaving his for his friend Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed). Larry's son Danny Gopnik (Aaron Wolff) is getting in trouble at Hebrew school, and one of Larry's student's Clive Park (David Yang) is bribing/threatening to sue Larry into giving him a passing grade. On his brother Arthur (Richard Kind) is unemployed and won't move off the couch. Larry goes to consult three rabbis to help figure out some kind of meaning. None of them work. The acting is fantastic. Stuhlbarg really plays the part of Larry really well. He really creates all of the pain that Larry is feeling on the screen. A lot of times the movie seems to be really fast paced. So fast it's uncomfortable. It could be annoying at first but to be fair this is one of the things that makes the movie so good. All this quick movement of problems helps the viewer feel the frustration that Larry is feeling. I'm not sure if this was the Coens' intention but if it was they did a great job.",A Serious Man
87,Likes_Ninjas90,"A hilarious, refreshing but perhaps also damning look at life in the suburbs of America, not to be missed",9,24 November 2009,"During the 1960s in Minnesota a Jewish man named Larry (Michael Stuhlbarg) is going through a rough patch. As a school mathematics teacher he is being pursued, and possibly bribed, by a Korean student to have his failing grade changed. At home, his own children, including his pot smoking son and self-absorbed daughter, have little regard for anyone but themselves. His brother Arthur (Richard Kind) is also causing problems by living off the families couch. Worst of all Larry's wife Judith (Sari Lennick) wants a divorce as she has openly admitted that she would like to marry their extremely condescending neighbour Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed). Larry seems unable to come to terms with any of this chaos even after consulting a number of rabbis about his dwindling faith.Directed by Joel and Ethan Cohen, A Serious Man has one of the strangest openings to a film you are likely to see this year. It begins with a prologue set in a nineteenth century village where the characters including, a husband, his wife and a neighbour who was thought to be dead but could be a ghost, speak entirely in Yiddish. Although this seems extremely odd, what occurs in this episode can be interpreted as like a curse for the continuous amount of bad luck faced by Larry in the present. To further reinforce this notion, Larry is told during the film that traditions are passed down through generations. It is an opening that will certainly generate a great deal of debate amongst viewers. After this episode though, A Serious Man, using biographical elements from the Cohen brothers themselves (they are both Jewish, born in Minnesota), is not unlike Burn After Reading. This is another comedy hilariously depicting a group of extremely shallow, oddball characters whose everyday lives are turned upside down through increasingly bizarre and exaggerated situations.The Cohen's derive a lot of humour from the sheer oddity of scenes and their ability to hold our attention through long silences or random stories, before reaching a punch line that echoes the themes of the film. At one point in the film Larry visits a much talked about rabbi. The rabbi's secretary stares at Larry without saying anything. She walks into the rabbi's long, drawn room, exchanges some inaudible words and then walks out to tell Larry in a raspy voice: ""he's busy"". It is revealed afterwards that the rabbi was listening to Jefferson Airplane instead of letting Larry see him, reiterating his lack of control in the way people treat him and ignore his needs. In another scene, a lengthy anecdote is told about an ancient inscription that was found by a dentist, while inspecting someone's teeth. The story itself is of course pointless and inconclusive but it upholds the essence of the film that Larry, outside of the classroom, is a man without any answers. Nothing is really meant to make sense to him or be conclusive. It is rather fitting that he scribes the mathematical formula of uncertainty on a blackboard. Even if the film does not have a thorough arc of character development through its uncertainty of life and a dark and somewhat abrupt ending, this is still a very clever, witty and original film that should be at least nominated for the Best Screenplay Oscar.Many laughs in this film are also captured purely from the gazes of the minor characters with their bizarre expressions and mannerisms. The Cohen brothers either have an exceptional choice in small time actors or more likely they have precision control over the way that the actors are to perform a scene. All of the actors in this film have been really sharply directed to consistently provide excellent comic timing. Interestingly, unlike Burn After Reading, A Serious Man is more subjectively focused towards a single character in Larry, whose life becomes so dysfunctional and chaotic that it is difficult not to feel something for him. He is extremely spineless in being unable to stand-up to anyone but because everything falls apart he warrants our sympathy and perhaps even our pity. Looking eerily like Joaquin Phoenix at times, Michael Stuhlbarg is wonderfully expressive as Larry, with his face shifting from gloom to sheer disbelief as his life falls apart. Fred Melamed also stands out as the extremely calm but wholly condescending Sy Ableman. It is testimony to the excellence of the Cohen brother's script that all of the performances collectively embody so much humour.Although without any major actors and a brief running time this may seem like a small Cohen brothers film, there is certainly no shortage of skill or effort in both the screenplay and the performances of the talented cast. A Serious Man may even warrant several viewing to thoroughly understand the complexities of some of the religious undertones. This is a hilarious, refreshing but perhaps also damning look at life in the suburbs of America, not to be missed.",A Serious Man

89,DonFishies,"Maddening, enigmatic and just plain boring",5,3 March 2010,"With every new film, the Coen Brothers continue to be the most enigmatic directors in cinema today. They started off as critically acclaimed cult directors who seemed to revel in the black comedy genre even more than Quentin Tarantino, and despite winning Oscars for the gritty, flawed masterpiece No Country for Old Men, have pretty much stuck with the genre. But while it stays within the genre, A Serious Man is a little different. Just thinking about it weeks later gives me a headache.The life of Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) is falling apart. He is fighting for tenure at the university he teaches at, a student is attempting to bribe him for a better mark on his midterm, his kids hate him, and his wife Judith (Sari Lennick) wants to leave him for an older man.Unfortunately, without getting into specifics about each character's relationship with Gopnik, or even the bizarre and incredibly random Jewish parable short that starts the film off, this is all I can offer you by way of a description of this very messy film. During the original theatrical run, there was a lot of talk about how personal the film was to the Coens, and how it meant a lot to them that they could make it. Well, that may be the case, but just because it is a personal effort does not necessarily make it a good effort.The film, quite simply, is incredibly boring. Events in the film come and go, and there is a disconnection in the film right from the start after the Jewish parable. Gopnik is not an interesting character in the least, and the story is only mildly interesting if at all. It feels like it was mindlessly thrown together with the hope that the randomness and wackiness of the plot would come to a cohesive finish. While this has worked in the favour of the Coens in the past, specifically with the cult classic The Big Lebowski, it just feels all too random here. The deliberately slow pacing of the film, the off-the-wall moments that drive the film, and the simple silliness of what takes place made me feel like my brain was falling apart. The way the film drags itself out is just agonizing to endure, and with a 106-minute running time, it makes for a very upsetting film to try and watch through its entirety in one sitting.But in thinking about this movie, Burn After Reading before it, and some of their earlier works (such as Blood Simple and Barton Fink), it dawns on me that the style the Coens exude is one of not carrying what anyone thinks. They make movies for themselves, with jokes that only they and the most astute filmgoers and critics will laugh at. A Serious Man is this exact style of a film, and even with going in hoping for the best, it is very hard to like this style of a film. It is a not so easily relatable enigma, and the fact that the Coens have become quasi-mainstream is a bit surprising considering their output of films like A Serious Man. But if it fits into the grand scheme of the work from the Coens, then where do films like Lebowski, No Country and even Fargo fit in? All three of these films are easily their most popular, and the ones that continue to connect with audiences. How can the Coens make nonsensical, totally disconnected drivel in one instance, and then make a film that actually comes together cohesively in another? What I did enjoy was Stuhlbarg. The man has barely registered on the radar, and this film is his first real lead effort. Despite the hindrances the film places on him with its script, the man is simply a marvel to watch in action. He makes Gopnik's increasingly horrible life real and emotional. He is a broken man going through a lot of problems, and you can see the trauma in his face even at the film's bleakest or most comedic moments. His performance is just about the only thing that can possibly draw the audience into this mess. When I wanted to turn the film off, I managed to keep watching simply because of Stuhlbarg. He is just a really likable guy, and I feel for him because of the hell the Coens put his character through. To have enough gusto to make it through a movie like this says a lot for the man, and for his passion for his work. Supporting turns from Curb Your Enthusiasm regular Richard Kind and Fred Melamed as the older man after Gopnik's wife are both fairly well done. Both provide comedic relief of sorts, and should have been featured a lot more.I wanted to really enjoy A Serious Man, but I just could not. It is the kind of film that begs to be seen again in order to experience and see something different, but I cannot bring myself to even attempt it. The film's incredibly boring nature hinders even the most remote desire for me to revisit it. And while I know the film has a lot of fans and was obviously well liked enough to be nominated for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay, I just did not enjoy it. Being a relative unknown helps launch Stuhlbarg's performance a lot higher than it would have been had the actor been well-known. But his work here, along with supporting turns from Kind and Melamed, is the only reason to watch the film. Even the biggest Coens Brothers fans may have a lot of trouble attempting to sit through the film. And with as uneven of a collection of directed works as they have, that says a lot.5/10.",A Serious Man

92,Eumenides_0,The Everyman Trying to Make Sense of Life,9,25 February 2010,"A Serious Man has restored my faith in the Coens. No Country For Old Men seemed like an odd departure from the absurdist themes that the brothers have always explored (it was technically perfect, but it was just humorless; one could not expect otherwise from a Cormac McCarthy adaptation), and Burn After Reading seemed like an attempt at compensating by being over the top silly without a fine purpose to it. But A Serious Man once again sees the brothers marrying everyday, believable characters with the absurdity of life that they understand and capture so well.Michael Stuhlbarg, an actor unknown to me, plays Larry Gopnik, a Jewish family man leading a simple life in '60s American suburbia. One day, for no apparent life, the simple life of Larry starts falling apart: a student tries to bribe him to pass him at Mathematics; his wife, Judy (played by Sari Lennick) confesses she's having an affair and wants a divorce. From here things just gets worse: he's up for tenure but he's informed anonymous letters are slandering him; he discovers unknown debts; he has to move to a motel. His misery just rises in intensity until the end of the movie.Amidst so much misery, Larry tries to understand why all this is happening to him. He consults Rabbis but he's always left without a satisfying answer. It's even more ironic because Larry teaches quantum physics, which explains that we can never be sure about anything. And yet Gopnik wants certainty in his life. Although the irony is lost on poor Larry, it's not lost on the viewer.People have attacked this movie for its pointlessness (I think they confuse the apparent pointlessness in Gopnik's movie with the movie's theme), and others have defended it as if it's some sort of philosophical treatise. Although I'm on the side of the defenders, I don't this movie needs a break from philosophy. Art and philosophy do not go hand in hand, what one cares about is not what the other cares about, and when they share the same interests they tackle it in very different ways. This movie is very simple, it's a comedy about peoples' arrogance in trying to grasp the entire meaning of existence. There is a character in the movie, Uncle Arthur (Richard Kind in a short but funny part), who spends his life working on a book called The Mentaculus, a map of probabilities. Arthur is a socially awkward man. The Coens are very clear in showing that such inquiries into the nature of reality are futile.The movie is constantly caustic and sarcastic. Although lesser filmmakers would have shown Larry's life as tragic and depressing, the Coens undermine the tragedy of it by constantly introducing the absurd into it. Poor Larry can't even have the luxury of being tragic, existence is too silly and frivolous for it.The Coen's technical impressiveness shines all the way through this movie, although I found Roger Deakins' usually awe-inspiring cinematography quite restrained this time. But it's still well-designed and structure: for instance, the movie is very repetitive, but not in a dull way. It has a rhythm, Larry's daily routine: school, arriving from work, dinner. Situations are repeated with variations, showing how Larry's life is steadily growing worse and worse until it reaches unbearable levels. For this reason some may consider the movie boring or even depressing, but for me it's the only way of depicting Larry's life spiraling out of control.I left the theater thinking if this movie was a good Coens movie. But now I have no doubt: A Serious Man ranks amongst their masterworks.",A Serious Man
93,SquigglyCrunch,Laugh Out Loud Funny and Very Well-Made,10,15 April 2016,"A Serious Man is the Coen Brothers comedy about a man with a pretty terrible life and goes looking for reasons as to why these things are happening to him. It's a hilarious movie, while still being able to deliver a solid message.The plot is actually quite good. The main character's life is terrible, which it does a good job of portraying, but it does so in a realistic way so that it doesn't feel forced or like it exists for the sake of comedy. It's very entertaining to see how his life plays out, and while it may be a tad boring at times, it's still interesting enough to keep me watching attentively. The characters are pretty solid too. You get a really good idea of who they are, even if some of them are a little cliché. A lot of it is for the comedic aspect of the movie, and it all works really well. The actors are all great too, including the child actors which is a nice break. The movie is very funny, which was a little surprising after watching the Coen Brothers' 2016 comedy 'Hail, Caesar!' Hail, Caesar! wasn't a bad movie by any means, nor was it unfunny, but the comedy wasn't really laugh-out-loud comedy. In A Serious Man I found myself laughing out loud fairly often, which is definitely a good thing when it comes to comedies. Overall A Serious Man is fantastic. It's very funny and still very interesting, and I just loved every part of this movie. In the end I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this movie to anyone who likes good comedy.",A Serious Man
94,ronakkotian,Pointlessness is the point,9,12 February 2021,"WARNING: *SPOILERS*The Coen Brothers are brilliant filmmakers and make fantastic films. Usually I find their films to be fairly easy to understand but A Serious Man required me to really think about it.A Serious Man follows Larry Gopnik, a physics professor whose life is seemingly getting worse aand worse and we see him try to find meaning and answers to explain all the bad incidents happening to him.This film sticks out in the Coens' filmography because of how different it is from the rest of their films. Filled with a cast of unknown actors at the time and tons of questions surrounding the plot, A Serious Man is one of the Coens' more experimental ventures. After seeing it, I was left confused by what I saw and so I tried to find meaning in it just like Larry Gopnik only to find out that it was pointless even trying.The way I see it, the Coens are explaining to us the pointlessness of trying to solve life's biggest questions. Throughout Larry's journey of finding out why he's constantly being beat up by the world we got no real answers. The rabbi's story of the Goy's teeth is a testament to that as it ends with no definitive explanation of what is written on his teeth. There is no point figuring out the meaning but at the same time that is the point. Larry is someone who firmly believes ""your actions have consequences"" but it can also be said how your inactions have consequences. Larry repeats throughout ""I didn't do anything"" which is true but that could also be the very reason behind his misfortune. His inability to handle situations and tackle them head on makes his life worse. Larry could also be seen an interpretation of Job and all the unfortunate events are part of God's trial. The end can be seen as Larry giving in when he accepts the bribe from the student leading to him ultimately failing the test and his life gradually becoming even worse. The truth is there is no real logical explanation as to what happens in the film and I think the Coen Brothers intended it that way.A Serious Man is a film I do love. Apart from the typical dark humour present in the Coens' films and the superb performances by the cast especially from Michael Stuhlbarg, I haven't stopped thinking about it. Why should we care? Why does Larry Gopnik's life get considerably get worse and worse? I don't know the answer and I don't think it matters. It's a story where you just have to ""accept the mystery"".",A Serious Man

96,ClaytonDavis,Seriously Inventive,7,18 October 2009,"Joel Coen & Ethan Coen have delivered a series of films in their careers that have been declared some of the finest works of contemporary cinema. Films that lay unparalleled to the next and raise the bar every time. As their most intimate portrait seen yet, the Coens have declared themselves, the best working directing duo in Hollywood. No other directors work so intricate and delicately together that enrich the mind with so much detail and authentic character creations.The head of the picture is Michael Stuhlbarg who plays Larry Gopnik, a Jewish husband and father who has had one too many run ins with bad luck. Stuhlbarg approaches Larry with such tenacity and wondrous dynamics. Oscar should take notice for this vivaciously in tuned actor who gives one of the year's finest performances. There's no apprehensiveness in his conveyance of Larry, none in sight. His comical and dramatic tactics are wholly motivating and inspired. Stuhlbarg gives a masters class on acting.Artistically the Coens ingenious yet slightly flawed script shows the pioneering efforts the brothers are advancing at this point in their careers. Carter Burwell's score and Jess Conchor's accurate production design are two nearly assured contenders in contention this awards season.The supporting players are also eccentric, bizarre and utterly nifty. Richard Kind who plays Uncle Arthur, Larry's socially awkward brother and Sari Lennick, who plays Judith, Larry's wife are the two boldest and resourceful of the cast. Lennick, in her debut role, looks like she's was born to act, as she dwells in the mind of a woman tormented and irate at her life. Kind is reliable, funny, and heartrending and deserves his Oscar due this year.A Serious Man, although at times unserious, is sternly fascinating and crucially needed to be watched of all fans of film, especially the Coens.***½/****",A Serious Man
97,MattBrady099,A Serious Man - Movie Review,10,24 March 2016,"Sy Ableman: ""I'm a serious man, Larry.""The story is about a Midwestern physics teacher, watches his life unravel over multiple sudden incidents. Though seeking meaning and answers amidst his turmoils, he seems to keep sinking.'A Serious Man' has to be the Coen Brothers most unappreciated movie when it comes to naming the Coen Brothers best movies, and yes there's plenty of outstanding movies from them, but lets not overlook movies such as this. The Coen Brothers have yet to disappoint me, even through I haven't seen every movie from them, but the ones I have watched I've given glowing reviews and so is this one, because 'A Serious Man' is a superb and wonderful piece of film making that I can't believe it took me this long to watch it.The Coens are masters of film making and there's no point of me pointing that out for you, since you can watch one of they movies (expect for The Ladykillers) and see the brilliance in the dialogue scenes and the reverse shots by them keeping the shots simple but precise enough to keep you engaged. And in this movie, the Coens did just that and that's take a simple man like Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) and put him in an endless cycle of torment, for serious or comedic effect. That's what I was so amazed by from start till finish, not because of the writing or the cinematography (which are perfect by the way), but that I easily related to the main characters struggle and the dying questions about his own religion and he's life. Many times in the movie Larry tries to seek help and answers, but gets shut out or doesn't get satisfying answers. This hit home for me as I know what that's like. Bravo Coens.Michael Stuhlbarg was absolutely fantastic in this movie and it's honestly one of he's best performance of his career (In my opinion). Stuhlbarg really dose bring a lot of emotion, depth and the human side to this character that we can easily simplify with. His reactions to hellish situations was spot on and realistic. It's hard to believe that he didn't get at least an Oscar nomination for this and just the thought of it is really hard to digest. Brilliantly performance Michael Stuhlbarg.Roger Deakins is one of the best cinematography's working today and it wasn't surprising that the best part of this movie was the cinematography, as it was flawless. Most of the time the camera is right close up to the characters and it has a wide lens to it so you would feel a sense of presence of being right there with somebody. It really dose add a lot to the scenes in this movie, I mean it made some scenes of the movie uncomfortable or kind of funny. That's the work of Roger Deakins everyone and it's glorious.I'm not going to spoil the ending to this movie, because I hate when people do that in reviews without any warnings, but let me tell you that the ending is such a gut-punch and will leave you completely speechless.Now for the problems: ... Overall 'A Serious Man' is an outstanding movie with brilliant performances from everyone and top notch writing from the Coens.

100,estreet-eva,"Why so serious, man?",4,5 December 2011,"The Cohens' latest very personal film looks deep into the life of the suburban Minneapolis Jewish community in 1967. Physics professor Larry Gopnik's wife is in love with the local Dr. Phil which consternates Larry both because of the cuckoldry and because his community's biggest objection is not the adultery but that his rival Sy Ableman is a widower of ""only"" 3 years. Something amiss with Larry's brother Arthur keeps him on the Gopnik couch -- what it is we are never sure. Larry's son stays in front of the TV and we know exactly why -- he and his Hebrew school chums have discovered the joys of pot. In short, Larry's life is unraveling and his attempts to tap into the collected knowledge of his people (non-Jewish characters are rarely referred to other than ""the goy(s)"") puts him in contact with a series of ineffectual rabbis. Is the Cohens' movie an attack on faith much like ""The Intention of Lying?"" Perhaps but it may also be critique of modern Jewish organized religion rather than the faith itself. Certainly the concept of doubt permeates the film and the highly personal nature of it could be the Cohens' only struggles with the faith. If all of this sounds like pretty heady, serious stuff it should as the movie, billed as a dark comedy, has only a few laugh-out-loud moments. ""The Big Lebowski"" with its light comic touches this sure ain't. If you came to learn more about Joel and Ethan and to think about some deep questions, you'll enjoy it. If you came for the funny, keep going.",A Serious Man
101,moviemanMA,Life lessons from the Coens,8,16 October 2009,"Joel and Ethan Coen's latest film, A Serious Man, is their most complex film to date. There is so much to analyze and take in. It starts off with an old Yiddish tale about a husband and wife who have a late night visitor during a snow storm. The wife thinks the visitor is an unwanted spirit while the husband thinks nothing of it. Whether or not the visitor was a spirit, we don't know, but we are presented with the idea that God has certain rules and they must be followed.Flash-forward to Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg), a physics professor in Minnesota. He lives a somewhat normal life with a wife, two kids, and his brother Arthur (Richard Kind). Everything fine, or at least not bad, when things take a turn for the worse. Everything all around Larry starts to a deteriorate. A disgruntled student comes into his office demanding his test grade be changed from an F to an A. He leaves an envelope with several one-hundred dollar bills.Following this incident, his wife decides it is time for a divorce and is leaving him for a mutual friend, his son owes a local boy money for marijuana, his daughter can't stand being at home, his brother keeps getting in the way, and his neighbor may or may not be stealing part of his property. To add to all of that, he is being considered by the senior professors for academic tenure. Needless to say, he has a lot on his plate.Like Job in the bible, Larry is presented with several challenges that test his faith. He goes to see several rabbis where he is presented with several ideas, but not real solution. Perhaps the quest for answers starts from within. Regardless, Larry must somehow maintain sanity while juggling all of these problems at once.The character of Larry Gopnik is very interesting. He is a somewhat average man with a nice home, solid demeanor, and no real enemies or troubles. We find out what happens when someone is pushed the to brink of a nervous breakdown. Will he teeter over the edge, or will he remain calm? It's a question you ask yourself after each obstacle.The Coens have really created a mature work here. They never seem to skip a beat regardless of what film they just completed. Coming off of what I thought was one of the better films of 2008, Burn After Reading, they almost completely change gears, but still, A Serious Man, like all of their previous films, has the same Coen Brothers feel. It helps that they use a lot of the same people in production like cinematographer Roger Deakins and other positions like set design, costume design, and music composition. They have all the right pieces, and all they do is assemble them around the story they create.They don't use a lot of big names here for this film. There are some recognizable faces like Richard Kind, George Wyner, and Michael Lerner (and of course Fyvush Finkel). By not using big name actors, these actors become more of a character than an actor playing a character. We believe them perhaps more than if there was someone with more star power.This isn't the Coens best film. I think some of the humor is a little over most people's heads, seeing as there are a lot of references to and phrases linked to Judaism and the Hebrew language itself. I was confused as to what tone the film was trying to set. There were times when I wanted to laugh but wasn't sure if the situation called for it.Still, after the watching the whole thing, I came to appreciate more what I saw earlier on. The Coens have a great way of wrapping up a film. This ending is more along the lines of No Country for Old Men. I'm sure some people would criticize the Coen Brothers for stopping abruptly and without regard for the audience. I feel however that the ending is just right. We are shown exactly what we needed to see. It made you think, doesn't really explain itself, and is very powerful.",A Serious Man
102,rgcustomer,Who Cares,6,4 February 2010,"So. I'm angry. After having purchased my tickets, and after sitting through this movie, am I better off? Did I enjoy it? Was it smart? Was it even the movie the trailer said it was? No. No. No. And F no.It was just so much mental masturbation. If the writer-producer-editor-directors are going to play with themselves this much, I think they owe me a handy too.I am seriously worried about the Coen team that brought us such excellent films as Blood Simple, Fargo, The Big Lebowski, and No Country For Old Men. The recent Burn After Reading was just OK, and then this stinker is plain awful.It amazes me that people get so hung up on searching for the symbolism in the movie, as if that is somehow important. It's completely irrelevant. The movie is what it is. You buy a ticket or get it on satellite or whatever, and you watch it. Either it was a dull waste of time like this one, or there is a cohesive thing that you feel you got your money's worth.This thing didn't really tell me anything about the characters, which were mostly cardboard caricatures.This thing didn't tell me anything about a plot, because there was no ending. All build-up and no payoff. (If films don't need endings, wouldn't it be cheaper to just cut 10 minutes off each film and con the viewers into thinking they saw the whole thing? You know this ""no ending"" thing is a cop-out).This thing didn't reveal to me any particular insights into life. Sure, lots of people inject their own ideas into the film, but those are not FROM the film. Mostly it's a bunch of people who want to sound smart and hip and accepted, sucking up to the Coen machine.Who cares? I paid $10, you jerks. You are not gods.

However I thought ""The Ladykillers"" was absolutely terrible as was ""Intolerable Cruelty."" On the other hand they made ""The Big Lewbowski"" which I will be forever grateful to them for.

Wikipedia calls it black comedy; I'd describe it more as a kind of ethnic/religious comedy.The film is set up by the 19th-century prologue in Eastern Europe of a man, his wife, and the man's encounter with a dybbuk. It sets up the humor in the rest of the movie.Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) is an assistant professor up for tenure. He has a wife, two kids, a modest house, and an eccentric brother who's currently crashing on the family's sofa. And then the troubles come. His wife, Judith (Sari Lennick), announces she wants a ""get,"" a Jewish divorce because she's in a relationship with Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed), an older university prof who is as unctuous as they come. Son Danny (Aaron Wolff) is in trouble with his marijuana dealer classmate because he hasn't paid for the last pot he bought.Daughter Sarah (Jessica McManus) is embarrassed by her family, and either washes her hair or goes to a teenage hangout with friends. Larry's brother, Arthur (Richard Kind), is brilliant but unable to hold a job. He constantly studies and writes a Mentaculus, described as a probability map of the universe. Arthur excels at poker, but the police are after him for gambling and later for other offenses.As his trouble escalates, Larry (and Arthur) are banned to the Jolly Roger motel.

105,Mike_Devine,Seriously depressing in a sort of hilarious way,6,30 May 2020,"The Coen brothers have come to be known for their very unique approach to filmmaking. Offbeat, quirky and tongue-in-cheek are just a few adjectives that have become synonymous with their work, and the 2009 best picture-nominated 'A Serious Man' is quintessential Coen.The film follows the depressing life of Larry Gopnik, the patriarch of a midwestern Jewish family trying to get through life in the 1960s. 'Man' is not flashy or sexy - instead, it's a dark, satirical comedy that is intended to be a commentary of sorts on challenges faced by men in the Jewish community during this period (although, it's fair to say this is an extreme case study). Anything that could possibly go wrong in Gopnik's life does, and he's forced to seek counsel from three rabbis to sort out his mess (played by Simon Helberg, George Wyner and Alan Mandell) - all of whom have different perspectives on how he can get out of his mess (or not).It's true that the cast in 'Man' is not a bunch of A-listers, and the subject matter is not the most lighthearted. But the way the Coens paint a picture of a man whose life feels so helpless is admirable (in an artistic way). It should be appreciated for what it is, not what it could be.Although it never stood a chance at winning the best picture honors, 'A Serious Man' is worth a watch by anyone who considers themselves a fan of Joel and Ethan.",A Serious Man

The film explores questions of faith, familiar responsibility and religion. It is the typical Coen movie combining drama and humor, with a slow rhythm but with a very interesting story, a very well developed plot unexpected twists and an ending that will leave you with doubts and an innumerable options for an end.

And where he wonders why God had abandoned him.How much can a man be exposed to before he breaks down? That is the question one asks when looking at the Coen brothers ""A Serious Man"".

However, there are a couple of things that you need to know before watching it. The most important is to know that 'A serious man' is a existentialist exercise of the Coen bros. rather than a 'conventional' film. Yes, it's not a common film. Knowing that will help you a lot to understand 'what the movie is about' and as well to not expect a dramatic appellative premise, because it don't has any apart from the Larry's quest to understand his life. Now, lets talk about the plot: Larry is a mathematician which doesn't understand the life in another way but the ""logic"" one. We can see that he has a lot of troubles since the beginning of the film, affecting all aspects in his life: psychological, in the job and in his family. He has lots of troubles. And in the ingoing of the film, everything becomes even worse. He doesn't understand why such 'bad' things are happening to him. In his head, he doesn't do nothing to deserve such 'punishment'. Again, for him, the life is like math. Logic. So, as a logic rational men which can't find any solution for his problems, he start to ask himself about the meaning of his life and why everything is going so wrong for him.

109,Meven_Stoffat,People are sheep.,1,28 September 2010,"Nothing is worse than an overrated film. Sure, a bad film is pretty bad. But a film that is rated much higher than it deserves certainly is worse in the sense that the film is hyped and has much potential but falters in its ability to deliver.Maybe the Coens just set the bar too high with No Country. That film is untouchable, near flawless. That film was so brilliant that hell, even Fargo and The Big Lebowski, both excellent films, paled in comparison. Sure, Burn After Reading was bad (and they did have, I believe, one clunker before that, which was the hilariously awful Barton Fink), but this goes too far.The only thing even remotely remarkable about the film is the ending, where the school is evacuated due to a tornado warning, and the film's final shot, of the young man watching the oncoming twister, a powerful moment. I'm not saying films have to have tornadoes in them to be good, I just expect a movie to be entertaining, even if it's poorly written. I can forgive a bad movie if its at least entertaining, but this isn't it.The writing is awful. The dialogue seems to be written by an immature 14 year old. Mind you this is the same Coen Brothers that gave us No Country For Old Men, Fargo, Blood Simple, and The Man Who Wasn't There. The editing is sloppy; most of the film consists of people staring for a really long time without dialogue. Granted if you removed all the ""long stares"" this film would be about 45-50 minutes long. The characters are all just stereotypes of not just Jewish characters but characters we've seen before (mind you I'm part-Jewish). The acting wasn't too bad, a little wooden at times but I think they did good for the lousy film they had to work on.As for getting a best picture nomination... when No Country won best picture in 2008, I was filled with joy, shouted ""YES"", and jumped up and down in happiness. This getting nominated for best picture??? Please, it's in the runnings with Transformers 2: Revenge of the Boring in terms of godawfulness (and I said the same thing about the equally awful ""The Hurt Locker"").I've said it once and I'll say it again, people are sheep. That is the only way people like this crap enough to inflate its rating to 7.2/10. I'm sure the ""art house"" crowd will tell me how I'm wrong and how I don't get it. But simply put, this film is overrated, pretentious garbage. I thought ""Burn After Reading"" was bad but no, this film is awful.",A Serious Man

I've never been into their movies with the exception of the last two - No Country for Old Men and Burn After Reading, which I found brilliant. With this one, I came out of it with the thought ""Wtf was this crap about?"".Maybe it's the Coen brothers or maybe it's the Jewish humor, but this movie reminded me of a sad sack dramatic version of Seinfeld, which I never got and also irritated me. The movie opened with a totally incongruent scene that would've been an interesting horror movie, and then went on to become the misadventures of one of the wimpiest guys ever seen on screen, and ended without a conclusion, or a point, for that matter.

111,druid333-2,Things Fall Apart,9,1 November 2009,"Let us all be thankful to Joel & Ethan Coen. Since their feature film debut,'Blood Simple' some 20 plus years ago,they've made a series of thought provoking films that ponder various aspects of the human condition. 'A Serious Man' will only cement their reputation even more. This time,they've opted to move away from working with well known actors,opting for relative unknowns (which isn't a bad thing). This time,the characters are drawn from variations of stories of Jewish folklore. After a short prologue,that could easily be told by a Rabbi,dealing with a couple in Poland in the 19th century,dealing with a Dybbuk (ghost),the story deals with Larry Gapik (played by Michael Struhlberg),a math professor in a high school that could be easily in the suburbs of the twin cities,who's life is beginning to unravel. He has found out that his wife is cheating on him with a family friend,Sy Abelman (Fred Melamed),his son & daughter are constantly fighting with each other,his brother,down on his luck has been living with them for some time now (and has worn out his welcome),as well as a myriad of other problems that is adding stress upon stress. The fact that he wants to consult with a Rabbi to talk about his problems (and is constantly dealing with disappointment after disappointment)isn't making things any better (plus Larry is haunted with some pretty messed up dreams). A Serious Man won't be everybody's proverbial cup of tea,but anybody who is a true fan of Joel & Ethan Coen should at least appreciate this one.

He doesn't react normally to shocking events, and takes no steps to take control of his life. OK - he talks to some Rabbis, who are pretty useless.

The satirical points on the Jewish lifestyle are personal to the Coens and their Jewish upbringing. Though this is far more dark than the bulk of their work, it still has the same quirky cast of characters that fill their films.The best part is the way the Coens make everything clever and full of both drama and comedy. Stuhlbarg's character is not one we cry over, but we certainly cheer him on and laugh with his strange dilemmas that prevent him from living a healthy life.

However one of his students is very unhappy with his grades and seems to be threatening to throw a spanner in the works.He is at his wits end and decides to ask his local rabbi for advice. He eventually sees (or rather tries to see) three different rabbis, with mixed results to say the least.Like all Coen movies it is brilliantly made and has some great darkly comic moments. You get the feeling the Coens are toying with the viewer though. They hint that great revelations will occur but leave with an ambiguous (but probably appropriate) ending.After his Bar Mitzvah Larry's son gets to meet the most senior rabbi, renowned for his learning and wisdom. After quoting from a ""Jefferson Airplane"" song the rabbi's main piece of advice is to ""be a good boy"".Perhaps that's what the Coen's are saying in this movie– good and bad things happen in life.

121,Michael Fargo,"""And God said...""",10,10 October 2009,"""Yes, but I didn't quite get that last part. Could you repeat that? Hello? Hello? Helllooooo?"" The Coen Brothers return to something close to their baroque style in ""Barton Fink,"" but they manage to bring a traditional arc to the storytelling and explore man's relationship with God in ways that reminded me often of Woody Allen's work. But if you can't really enjoy the folly that often accompanies matters of faith—particularly if you're a mathematician like the protagonist here,who's programmed for everything to add up—and if you aren't able to laugh at the furies of fate, this film won't sit well.I don't think one needs schooling in the Jewish faith to enjoy this movie. The God of Abraham is the same God as the majority of religions. There's great wisdom in this film, and it's masked by the suffering of all who enjoy this life. Even if you can't grasp or appreciate the tone of the movie, you'll recognize wonderful film-making, particularly in the work of Roger Deacons' stark cinematography (I don't know why the 1960's seem to be appropriately shot in hard-focused, hyper realism with saturate colors, but it always evokes the era), and then there are the performances.The cast is mostly new, and certainly not from the usual Coen Brother's crew. Everyone is outstanding, but Sari Lennick, Aaron Wolff and Jessica McManus are the members of the primary family, and they are sensational. You can accuse them of extreme selfishness; however, they have their own lives to endure, and the fact that they don't consider their husband/father's struggles is one of the film's more exacting targets.I don't know how Michael Stuhlbarg could have been better. His role is similarly drawn to William H. Macy's in ""Fargo."" Except here, we see a man fighting his fate and the world's trials with great dignity and morality. It doesn't get him much further than Macy's character in ""Fargo,"" but we admire him rather than reject him. And the absence of self-pity is the key. Michael Stuhlbarg as Larry Gopnik never quits trying even if guilt and doubt are his partners in every move.The scenes before a series of Rabbis are the heart of the film. Much of the story is simply an illustration for the questions Larry Gopnik brings to these Rabbis. And instead of making these sessions stuffy and righteous, they're just out of our grasp like they are to Larry. Still, the wisdom being conveyed ""Life is like that parking lot"" for instance, are actually full of great wisdom.Will Larry ""get it"" or even will we is the question of our life's or journey. And The Coen Brothers concoct the world of their childhood in a post-Obama film where everything seems impossible to correct or even to fairly address, and we're asked the great moral and religious questions of man. I hope we can all laugh at ourselves the way we're invited to laugh at Larry Gopnik when literally every phone call can bring something infuriatingly mundane or terrifyingly fearful. Because if we can't laugh, it's a long hard road.And the next time you think God is speaking to you, try to listen carefully. (You won't, but try.)",A Serious Man

I like to follow a film from beginning to end and understand it, to be honest, I amnot stupid or lacking in intellect or in religious belief but did struggle to understand the movie.One assumes the Cohens are Jews and hence the strong Jewish theme to the film. the opening 8 minute scene to the film completely foxed me for the remainder of the film, I nearly took the DVD out and thought I had the wrong movie inserted until .....Also foxed by the ending though the tornado/holocaust explanations given by other reviewers help a great deal.was Larry cursed? difficult to say. he was certainly an inadequate fellow and it was Sy Ableman who maintained the theme and reminder of the 'Serious man'.film done on a low budget and with largely unknown actors because this time around, one must assume any of the top names didn't want to touch it. this is a bad film because it is a confusing film and assumes we have read up on our bibles recently and have a firm religious understanding for what will be illustrated during the movie.sure the move s clever in parts and there is some good dialogue but I was craving for the ending long before it came and even a triple rewind of the ending didn't help to provide an understanding.Perhaps I should check up on the Book of Job.I thoroughly enjoyed No country for old men, but sorry folks, not this one.

For my second Coen Bros movie, I liked it a lot.",8,2 May 2010,"'A Serious Man', I didn't have any clue about this film before I saw that it was nominated for best picture in the Oscars this year. So, I had to see what was so special about the movie, directed by the Coen Brothers. The opening scene with the period setting is what drew me in.This is a black comedy which revolves around Lawrence Gopnik's (Larry) life as he watches his life begin to unravel through various incidents. His wife is leaving him for another man - Sy Ableman who is a recent widower while emptying him of all his savings, his son is into drugs (he doesn't know that), the daughter doesn't go to school, his brother is living on his couch, he is being bribed by a Chinese student to pass him, and he seems to have been enamoured by his neighbourhood lady who's husband is out of town all the time. All of this while seeking answers in a spiritual way, when physics didn't have an answer for him. There are three different rabbi's in Larry's life and each one of them have a different view on his life.I am not a jew to actually relate to the characters and also this is my second Coen brothers movie after Burn After Reading (which I liked). So, I don't know what all the fuss is about the Coen brothers and I am definitely not a fan (maybe not yet?). The opening is what held my attention. A rabbi helps a man with his cart or something in the middle of the night and apparently he knows the man's wife. So, the man invites him over for soup(!! I guess it is the time period). The wife tells the man that the rabbi had been dead for the past three years and the thing that is sitting in their living room is a dybukk, but the man, being a believer in science and physics, doesn't believe in spirits and conveys the same to his wife. The rabbi was speaking so normally, dressed normally and even had a solid body, how could he believe her? No sane person would. So, the wife puts a knife into the rabbi's heart, upon which the rabbi just laughs and goes out of the home into the heavy snowfall. That scene was very powerful. I just loved it. It shows that even though we live in an age of science where everything can be explained rationally, there are some things which can be the work of the gods and we can't really do anything about it. I thought that they would expand on the spirits plot, but they took it in a different direction.After that, the movie jumps into Larry's class where he is explaining the Schrodinger's cat paradox. Is the cat alive? Modern physics made an absurd prediction that one can never know until the box is opened and the cat could have lived inside the box in a mysterious time or state, until you opened the box. All of this is relevant with the proceedings of Larry's life. Some have said the story leaves you hanging at the end, there is no closure. But, the film began with a day in Larry's boring life and when it ends, life must continue for Larry. This was just a brief view of his life. I wouldn't recommend this film to everyone as some may get bored. Still, it was an intriguing drama, with some black comedy thrown in.8/10",A Serious Man

125,krzysiektom,Superb. For me their best.,10,5 February 2010,"For me the Coens are extremely good and intelligent filmmakers, but their films even so are rather hit and miss for me. For ex. I did not like Burn after r. and never understood why No Country was great. However, this one is in my opinion a superbly written and made film. Especially written - the script must rank among the most intelligent, shrewd, multi-level of all time. As usual, the best scripts offer many questions but not the answers. The answers are for the viewer to figure out. I will seriously curse at the Academy if it does not win Oscar for the best screenplay and for ex. Avatar does! Well at least it is nominated, so the Academy are not that bad. Maybe partly this script resonates with me so much because I am a sucker for the quantum theory and its possible influence on the daily life. I mean it is so fascinating that we cannot predict the very exact position of even the smallest particles, so how can we predict with certainty anything else? Maybe the most famous opinion about it is by A. Einstein, and it is rather critical: ""The God does not play dice with the Universe"". Or does it? Or there is no God to be playing dice with us at all? I think in a way the Coens make us think about such stuff with this film, which makes it a true art. The film's many scenes and the general sense can be discussed a long time and given many interpretations. Which means it is a great script, doesn't it. Even the prologue is open for debating: for me the Coens do 3 things here: - it is an illustration of the ""Schroedinger's cat"" riddle: unless u look inside the box u cannot determine whether the cat is alive or dead, or else it is both dead AND alive at the same time. - It illustrates how the beliefs in the afterlife, in spirits, fairy tales, religious hogwash if u like, can lead to a tragedy in real life (the woman would never think of stabbing the old man unless she believed he was a dybbuk); and third: it leaves it to the viewer to interpret the rest of the film and what happens to Gopnik either as a result of the prologue or as having nothing to do with it. If u do think it is a result, it means u too have your brain washed by the stories about dybbuks etc.; at least on the sub-conscious level. The situation with the bribe left by the Corean student offers Gopnik an alternative where nothing makes sense: whether he accepts the bribe or rejects it he is likely to lose. The complexity of this apparently mundane and simple situation is mind-boggling to Gopnik, and to me as well, it is an example of the complexity of the world that we cannot comprehend. For Gopnik this and many other unhappy events are especially unfair because he ""did not do anything"" Right, he did not do anything to deserve it yet it happens. Therefore, does life make any sense at all, or it is rather a chain of random events, where good things can happen to bad people and vice versa?? Clearly the consulted rabbis cannot untangle this conundrum that he found himself in. At first I thought the oldest, ""wisest"" rabbi (the Coens repeat a few times that he is wise) behaved like an arrogant old man towards Gopnik, when he did not want to see him. But later the same rabbi offers his son on the bar mitzvah day the coolest piece of advise, and it is just a quotation for a ""Jefferson airplane"" song! So when the rabbis' secretary told Gopnik that the rabbi ""was thinking"" it was not to get rid of him, it was true and the only advice Gopnik was given: if one thinks one should resolve the problems of the daily life without the pretentious advice from the religious officials, who have nothing new to say anyway. The rabbi's silence was the sign of this wisdom and humble understanding that he had nothing new to offer to adult, mature members of the Jewish community that they could not figure out for themselves. And although the film is about such serious stuff it is never pandering, solemn or self-important. It is light on its feet and sometimes funny, well shot and well acted. Great cinema.",A Serious Man
126,colinrgeorge,"""A Serious Man""",9,6 April 2010,"With a prolificacy unprecedented in their decade and a half film-making career, the Coen brothers have released three films in three consecutive years. The first, 2007's ""No Country for Old Men"" won the duo a long belated best picture Oscar. Their second, the amiable ""Burn After Reading"" received mixed reviews but remained a commercial success. ""A Serious Man,"" their latest, is a semi-autobiographical parable about the relevance of religion to modern society (modern being the seventies for a pair that have so tirelessly explored the earlier half of the twentieth century). To label the piece one of the best films of the year is to undersell it; it's the Coens' best film of the decade.The statement gives an initial impression of grandeur, but is still somewhat misleading given that the new millennium has seen a median decline in the quality of the Coens' work, if only when compared to their streak of wildly diverse successes during the nineties. 2003 and 2004 also saw the release of their two most styleless films (""Intolerable Cruelty,"" ""The Ladykillers""), which may prompt more cynical readers to regard my proclamation as somewhat hallow. The greatest compliment I can pay the Coen brothers' latest effort may simply be to say that it holds up to their best work. Radically different in setting and character while still embodying an ineffable Coen-ness, ""A Serious Man"" is truly worthy of the duo's legacy.Tonally, it bears closest similarity to ""Fargo,"" in that the filmmakers' bizarre humor remains in tact, but is broadcast at a lower decibel than ""Burn After Reading,"" or ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" ""A Serious Man"" is a subtly engaging film, its pacing slow and deliberate, with a series of escalating misfortunes that ratchet up the tension for the Coen's surrogate father, protagonist Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg), until the apotheosis funnels into one of the most viscerally cinematic and profoundly powerful endings in recent memory. The only thing that comes close is maybe the last five minutes of Paul Thomas Anderson's ""There Will Be Blood.""Without spoiling anything, the film is deliberately constructed to leave the interpretation of God, or the manifestation of His will, up to the viewer. Is ""A Serious Man"" a film about fate, about the futility of religious practice, or about its importance? Plug in either interpretation and it works, and that's just a sliver of the film's brilliance. Religion is really a perfect subject for the Coens, given that the pair has always favored the unresolved and the unexplained in their storytelling. For them, God is the ultimate question mark.But more importantly, above its philosophical and theological subtext, ""A Serious Man"" is an entertaining story. More reserved than perhaps any of their films, the Coens still squeeze in their signature hard-edged silliness with a cast of memorable characters and offbeat subplots involving the people in Larry's life: his dope-smoking son, dope-smoking neighbor, live-in brother, estranged wife, and her prospective future husband. Truth be told, the events that transpire are rarely enthralling in the moment, but the further I stand from them, the more complete and satisfying a portrait they form. The final moments are beautiful and haunting, and tie everything together so well with so little that you may not realize how perfect it is until the credits are already rolling.The Coens have reasserted themselves as incomparable American filmmakers worthy of mention in the same breath as genre-chameleon Billy Wilder. With a relatively dry award season ahead of us, ""A Serious Man"" is at the top of my list, and though the pair won their first best picture Oscar only two years ago, it suddenly seems rather implausible that they'll be waiting another thirteen years for their next.",A Serious Man
127,gilleliath,'receive with simplicity all that happens to you',9,5 June 2019,"This has got to be one of the most chillingly bleak films ever. If you watch Schindler's List or The Pianist the general background is awful but you can take comfort from the little acts of courage or kindness of the heroes. If you watch a horror or slasher movie you can tell yourself its only a fantasy - or at least, very unlikely to happen to you. In a Ken Loach sociology drama things are bad, but the government could fix it if they chose. Even The Road has a sort-of happy ending. But this film shows you an average life, the good life, the American dream - what actually happens after the guy gets the girl and rides off into the sunset. And it's horrible.When this guy's life falls apart, without anything dramatic or unusual happening and (as he keeps saying helplessly) without him having done anything, no-one can help - and least of all does he get any spiritual comfort from the useless rabbis. Precisely because he hasn't done anything wrong (except that he is maybe a bit too passive and pathetic), there is nothing he can do to fix it. How bad can it get? How much can he take? The credits roll before we actually find out, but we all know that life only ends one way...The only thing redeeming the story is the sly black humour with which the Coens continue to heap disasters onto their hero - but it's too grim for any real laughter. Maybe you could try to be philosophical about it, as suggested by the Rashi epigram at the start? Certainly it's implied that the Jewish community's traditions are a source of consolation and strength - the bar mitzvah is the only positive scene in the whole thing.The Jewish aspect, emphasised by the 'prologue' film in Yiddish, is a recurring Coens theme but more emphasised here than elsewhere; the same goes for marital infidelity. Is this their best film as some critics have said? No, their masterpiece is The Big Lebowski; just because this is (as the title tells you) the most serious, it isn't automatically the best.

In A Serious Man they get self reflective on their own childhoods growing up in a Jewish family of the 1960's. The result is their most personal, incisive film to date, and one that is told with sharp observation and honesty.An opening scene tells the tale of a peasant couple visited by an elderly man who turns out to be a ghost. Are they cursed or blessed by this ominous apparition? In a 1960's Minnesota suburb, Larry Gopnik is a timid college professor with a wife, son, and daughter. His son is smoking pot, and his daughter steals his money for a nose job. One day his wife announces that she and his best friend Sy have become close and that she wants a divorce. Further, Sy wants to have a long talk with Larry to counsel and help him through his tough time. This happens at the same time Larry is up for tenure at his college, and a Korean student tries to bribe him for a passing grade. As if this weren't enough, his brother, Arthur, who has all sorts of physical ailments and personal problems, is staying at his house. Meanwhile, Larry spies on and is tortured by his female neighbor who likes to sunbathe in the nude.Things go from bad to frustratingly worse as Larry goes to see three rabbis for advice only to get inconclusive or non-answers. His bills with the attorneys are mounting, and he is told to move out of his own house. Now the Korean student's dad threatens to sue him, and he is plagued by nightmares. The events don't turn out as expected and the twists and turns culminate with his son completing his bar mitzvah. An ominous new set of events threatens to uproot his world even as Larry seeks to make sense and order of his plight and tries to do the right things and be a 'serious man'.The storyline will ring true for most audiences, especially baby boomers. Larry is a brilliant study in angst and suffering. By the film's ending, the question remains: what is important in one's life? What matters most? No commentary is made or judgment passed about Larry and his family, and the Coens offer no answers. What we get is a case study of one family trying to survive fractious events. Although told from their Jewish background and experiences, the Coens are able to strike the right emotional connection by showing Larry's response to a difficult set of circumstances. His feelings and reactions are universal, and perhaps that is the point of the movie: The problems of the common man are eternal and life is a stream of situations that can be daunting and are constantly supplanted by new adversity. Much as Ordinary People revealed discord and a disconnect in a middle class family, A Serious Man shows this family slowly disintegrating. Larry's situation bears striking similarities to the lead in Into the Night.A mostly unknown cast actually helps the film by not having the distraction of well known faces. They are people like you and me. Michael Stuhlbarg is quite convincing as Larry, and folks might recognize Arthur portrayed by TV character actor Richard Kind.It's not the Coens' best work but it is their most intimate one which they could afford to do after winning Best Picture with No Country for Old Men only a couple years before. It's certainly one of the most original screenplays of the year.",A Serious Man

132,fablesofthereconstru-1,The faithless faith of a serious man,10,20 November 2009,"The Gopniks live in suburbia, among the goys, in tract houses with perfect lawns that have no white picket fences to help demarcate where properties begin and end. Although the Gopnik tract house looks like everybody else's tract house, it's not the same, and Larry Gopnik(Michael Stuhlberg) knows it. He feels the difference after each near-encounter with his immediate neighbors, a father and son, who ignore the college professor whenever they're both within talking distance in the seamless yards, where the latter man tries to be neighborly, to no avail. It isn't the first time, this set of gentiles, the moviegoer suspects, have turned their backs on Larry, the only Jew in the development, seemingly. They toss the baseball around more as an exclusionary tactic than as a pure expression of male camaraderie. The father and son throw and catch at such an accelerated pace, Larry can't get a word in edgewise. There's no entry point for the Jew to fully integrate himself with the goys, and just be one of the guys. Life for the Jews in middle America might have been better in the sixties than the era recounted in Phillip Roth's novel ""The Plot Against America"", but that's because openly anti-Semitic behavior was no longer in vogue. In this instance, such racism is intimated through the cold shoulder of a neighbor, whereas in the past(the WWII homefront milieu of the Roth novel), this same neighbor might have squared his shoulders toward Larry, and fired away with his mouth. (In a dream sequence, this same man fires away at Larry's brother, which indicates that the Jew feels the undercurrent of violence during his terse exchanges with the gun nut.) The Gopniks live somewhere in the midwest. They're assimilated Jews, and it's 1966: the year Larry angers Hashem, who seems to have chosen the physics professor to be made an example out of.A serious man doesn't believe in magic. At the outset, the film hearkens back to the old country, where a peasant woman, believing that her husband has brought a ""dybbuk"" home for a bowl of soup, stabs this manifestation of Jewish folklore in the chest. Fast-forward to the present, where Larry, a physics professor awaiting tenure at some mid-level university, teaches a subject that's antithetical to the spiritual realm, which he, on a superficial level, still abides by. Danny(Aaron Wolf), his son, attends Hebrew school, even though mathematics(and science) disproves the existence of god. As Danny's teacher tends to the chalkboard, the moviegoer sees how the boy is just like his father, as he too inhabits both worlds, in which the boy lends one ear to a lecture on the Torah, and one ear to Grace Slick(of The Jefferson Airplane) imploring that Danny find ""Somebody to Love"" emanating from a tiny plastic earphone. Even better, this negotiation of traditional and popular cultures clash to even greater heights when Danny reads from the ancient religious text while stoned on marijuana at his Bar Mitzvah. Perhaps, the Gopniks' Americanization angers Hashem. (The everyday presence of Hashem in such modern trappings is suggested by ""The First Rabbi"", the junior rabbi that Larry seeks counsel with.) Larry's son wants to watch ""F-Troop"". Larry's wife wants a divorce so she can marry a man who believes in magic, Sy Ableman(Fred Melamed); he insists that Judith(Sari Lennick) get a ritual divorce so the two may marry in the faith. Larry believes in science; he just goes through the motions of his Judaism. A serious man believes in empirical evidence to prove that something exists, like an oncoming tornado, or a shadow that mysteriously appears on an x-ray, weeks after the patient was issued a clean bill of health. What looks like science, might actually be the wrath of god, of Hashem. A less serious man would see it in such a light. A serious man, like Larry, will miss the irony.Earlier in the film, Larry fixes the aerial on his roof(so Danny can watch ""F-Troop""), and sees his neighborhood from a different perspective; the perspective that remains obscured by his dogged insistence that the children(he also has a daughter) grow up Jewish. From his position of elevation, he sees a miracle, a secular miracle, a nude woman sun-bathing in her backyard. The math tells Larry how this ""divine"" act is made possible.",A Serious Man
133,kekca,My rating: 10,10,30 July 2013,"Incredible movie! The first made from Cohen brothers that I watched, the first to be developed that way and has a storyline that I had never met before.The film tells of a serious man - university professor who spent his life slowly and methodically paving his way towards happiness. And just at the moment when he got the highest point his life takes exactly the opposite direction until it collapses completely. Slowly, little by little, he loses his job, his family and finally his hometown. Even the most good thing that happens to him appears to be just a dream.It's really scary feeling of the approaching disaster, unforeseen pitfalls and inability to fight destiny. To know that there are things that are in no way influenced by our desires and abilities is discouraging.

Another Focus picture reaching new lows of boredom (also did Lost in Translation, 21 grams, Burn after reading, Evening...)There is nothing funny about this movie, I did not even crack a smile. It is not a drama since NONE of the characters have any cause there is no story purpose. The story is all over the place, yet it goes nowhere.

Ohh and as a bonus...Richard Kind has a lousy role of a slump cousin with some giant back pimple or something.I guess the Coen bros were trying to score points with Jewish community, which is VERY powerful in the movie industry.

135,rdukeesq,hoy ve this film is a mitzvah,8,28 May 2011,"So i watched the Coen brothers ""A serious man"", well was it a good movie well.... before I say, lets look at some past achievements by these brothers. Let's see, Blood simple (gripping), Raising Arizona (comical and surreal), Barton Fink (surreal), Miller's crossing (gripping and intense), Fargo (gripping, intense, comical), The Big Lebowski (Dude.. do I need to say more o.k comical and surreal), O'brother Where Art Thou (comical, surreal), and No Country for old Men (gripping and intense). There are others but lets face it these are the gems and there are a lot of them. These guys do very distinct genres extremely well, comedy and intense movies. So there can be a lot of cross over and that surreal aspect is always willing to jump in and join either party, and I found this to be the case with a Serious Man, which is seriously good. I almost shamefully admit I have seen No Country for Old Men too many times to remember, it seems every time I see it pop up on TV I say I am going to watch a couple of minutes and get sucked in. So why do I mention this well I need to make some time to see a Serious Man again. It is the surreal, philosophical aspect that I want to revisit. It is a movie that is very deep, and I found myself questioning the gathering storm of the main character Larry Gopnik's life. What does it all mean? A question I am not sure Larry solved either. On a more personal level, I grew up in a very Jewish family, and I always like those movies that take me back to my younger days and remind me of the culture and religious traditions I was raised in. This is a great movie, but it is a much more cerebral movie than No Country for Old Men, and therefore is just for those of you that I hope find me Raoul Duke the greatest movie critic ever that no one reads. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",A Serious Man
136,Ron Plasma,(Insert John McEnroe quote here),7,2 February 2010,"I often look for ""sparkle"" in lighter films, that drive that keeps the smile planted firmly on my face throughout. I can't say A Serious Man sparkles, but my great anticipation was rewarded with a fascinating film. Fascinating – but what did it all mean? Another one of those Coen brother films, all very episodic, puzzling, yet throughout this outing my furrowed brow repeatedly gave way to a cathartic belly laugh.Was this really a Biblical epic – set in suburban Minneapolis? If so it deserves to be wrapped up as a boxed set with ""The Life Of Brian"".Ron(Viewed 6Dec09)",A Serious Man
137,Monotreme02,The Coen's most cerebral film to date: fascinating and impeccably well-made,9,12 January 2010,"It is certainly an odd bird of a film. The Coens start it off with a pre-credits stand-alone short depicting an old fable of a Jewish couple being visited on a cold, winter's night by a Rabbi who may or may not have died three years prior; in classic Coen style, when the brothers couldn't find an existing fable that fit what they wanted to tell, they made one up and wrote it entirely in Yiddish no less. Afterwards the actual film begins and the connection between the Yiddish short and the 1970's-set story is never really made apparent. The story launches us into an intricate world constructed partly of memory and partly of historic events, a stylized version of the Coen brothers' childhoods if you will; rich with period detail but also with more dream-like imagery. The story itself is highly allegorical. Larry Gopnik finds the American dream falling apart around him. His brother is a mathematical genius but is also a sociopath and a slob who sleeps on Larry's couch and constantly finds himself being brought home by police officers for illegal gambling. His son is rebellious and disrespectful, smoking marijuana and listening to Jefferson Airplane and Santana on a transistor radio while in Hebrew class. His wife leaves him for his best friend. And all the while, Larry tries (and ultimately, pretty much fails) to understand why all this is happening to him. Is it the world that is changing around him? Or has he done something wrong? Is it his drifting away from his faith? Perhaps it is he who is unfaithful to his wife, gawking at his promiscuous neighbor from his vantage point on the roof of his house while she sunbathes? Is he letting his son slip away, or is his rebellion simply the natural evolution of American culture at the time, drifting away from faith and values and tradition and plugging into the pop culture information stream. The film raises these questions and many more, and doesn't seem particularly interested in providing answers for them. Rather, it tries to craft an understanding of the period and of the culture, perhaps to indicate the huge gap between where things were then and where they are now.I've gone on about the film's themes and ideas and haven't even mentioned its technical elements, which are definitely worth bringing up. After a one-film gap the Coens are back with their regular cinematographer, Roger Deakins, and the return to form is quite apparent. ""Burn After Reading"" was shot by Emmanuel Lubezski, another one of my favorite working cinematographers but whose work on that Coen film was pretty generic; the visual language in ""A Serious Man"" just emphasizes the great rapport the directors and Deakins have acquired over the years. It's a highly stylized and gorgeously shot film, featuring the Coen's usual style of a constantly moving camera with many smooth dollies and crane shots, and also Deakins style of indirect lighting and asymmetrical but aesthetic compositions, and all of it combined serves to create a uniquely rich visual style that has come to be identified with and be expected of the Coens. I have recently pointed out a trend in the form of the ""indie period drama"", independently-produced films with an indie aesthetic (and budget) which are nonetheless rich in period detail and accuracy. A good number of them this year have been set in the 1960's, interestingly enough, and as expected from the Coens (who are no strangers to period settings), the details in the set design, costumes, cars, language, behavior and everything are exceedingly accurate and detailed. Also worth mentioning are the fantastic performances. As I mentioned before, the film lacks the heavy star-power that has characterized many previous Coen efforts, but the cast is still packed with familiar faces audiences have seen in the background on TV and elsewhere, who really get a chance to shine here. Particularly worthy of note is Michael Stuhlbarg, who completely embodies the role of the neurotic protagonist whose world is crumbling around him. Topping it all off is yet another effective and memorable musical score/recurring theme (as it often is in their films) by Carter Burwell, the Coen's most loyal and frequent collaborator.""When the truth is found to be lies / and all the joy within you dies / don't you want somebody to love / don't you need somebody to love?"" Thus goes the classic Jefferson Airplane song that serves as a recurring motif throughout the film, and I think it pretty much sums up, albeit very simply, what the film is really about. Larry perhaps finds out that the truth he has believed in all his life, invested his faith and tradition in, is not what it seems. Judaism has let him down, specifically his community's leadership, and all he wants is somebody to love. But his brother is a degenerate. His wife left him. His neighbor seduces him but he knows that it's not love. His son is a lost cause and drifting very rapidly away from him; his daughter is already long gone. What's left for him to do? ""I've tried to be a serious man,"" he pleads. By that he doesn't mean someone who is humorless, but rather, the term refers to someone who is serious about his Jewish faith and about allowing that faith to guide their life. But he is let down, time and time again, and finds himself lost and delirious and jaded. The film's quite abrupt and startling ending further emphasizes that nobody, especially not Larry, can stop the storm that is about to sweep over his life, and mo matter how he's led it, how much he's invested in his faith, his culture his tradition, his values – all of it is meaningless in the ever-changing seas of the world that surrounds us.",A Serious Man
138,manicman84,an admirably vicious dark comedy that ranks among Coens' strongest entries,8,25 March 2010,"You'll be ill-advised if you're expecting a feel good movie from Coen brothers. In A Serious Man once again they don't give a damn whether you're going to like it or not. The film tells the story of Larry Gopnik, a Jewish physics professor who struggles with his numerous problems that not only concern his family life. His vicissitudes are unfortunate to the point of tragic, yet Coens are able to find plenty of pitch-black humor in them. Their very observational and witty script has no limits with oddly hilarious prologue and many ingenious fantasy sequences depicting Larry's increasingly poor state of mind. This very personal tone of the story never feels sentimental with Coens freely exploring such supposedly distinct themes as faith, academia and dental phenomena. The film also benefits from stylish cinematography, superb set design and strong acting from the entire cast. Michael Stuhlbarg is amazing in the leading role providing his character with equal doses of intelligence, uncertainty and hopelessness. The whole movie practically belongs to his sympathetic portrayal of Larry. Overall, A Serious Man is an admirably vicious dark comedy that ranks among Coens' strongest entries.",A Serious Man
139,nqure,Laughter in the dark,7,20 January 2014,"I've never been a big fan of the Coens. This weekend, terrestrial TV featured 'A Serious Man' & 'The Big Lebowski'. After watching the latter, I couldn't understand why 'The Big Lebowski' has become such a cult classic (unlike, say, 'Withnail & I'). Like many of their films, it featured a convoluted plot, an array of bizarre characters/ situations & genre-bending. Their films are intellectually smart but emotionally cold.I struggled with 'A Serious Man' on a first viewing, but something resonated with me. I decided to persist with it and watch it a second time, especially after reading some of the comments here on IMDb.And I have to say I enjoyed this modern take on 'The Book of Job', which remains accessible but contains many subtle layers.A prologue, set in 19th century Europe, sets the tone for a film about uncertainty: is what we see real or not? A mystery that is never solved.Larry Gopnik, a Physics lecturer, suddenly finds his life falling apart, personally & professionally, and all for no reason. He tries to make sense of it all. What does it all mean? And so begins his existential/philosophical search for the truth as signalled at the film's opening by the imaginative use of the 'Jefferson Airplane's' track 'Somebody to Love', a song about alienation and despair.As Larry is a scientist, there are also allusions to various theories (The Uncertainty Theory). Larry tells his troublesome student, Clive, that even he doesn't quite understand them, that they are 'fables'. His brother Arthur has a curious probability theory on the universe, which appears a curious amalgam of Hebrew (the classroom lesson, Old Testament texts) and scientific formulas & diagrams.That Larry is a scientist is no accident in the film. For he is someone who believes the world conforms to logic/reason, but has to learn that the ineffable does not conform to logic and that some things remain a mystery. Ironically, Larry's lecture on 'uncertainty' occurs in a dream, where he perhaps finally grasps the true nature of things at a subconscious level.The film appears to follow no logic, interspersed by random events but loosely structured around Larry's visits to three rabbis. Thus the theme of the film, the uncertainty of things, the unpredictability of life, is reflected in the film's own structure.Scenes, though, are carefully calibrated. When Larry argues with Clive's father over a supposed bribe & a charge of defamation (another simultaneous paradox, vis Schrodinger's cat, is it alive or dead?), the father denies knowledge, uttering gnomically, ""Accept the mystery."" And this is what Larry learns through his search. The meetings with a junior rabbi & rabbi Nachtner are witty, but serious. One tells Larry that he needs to change how he views the world if he can't see God everywhere– even in a the car park. Nachtner tells a story about a bizarre sign found in someone's teeth, essentially a shaggy dog story about reading the meaning in things which have no answers, so why bother to drive yourself crazy. Just live instead. But Larry's neuroses leave him unsatisfied. Why does God give us the ability to ask questions, but deny us an answer. And so his futile search continues. For instance, Larry is about to find the answer to a neighbourhood dispute when the attorney drops dead. Again, another answer is withheld from him.And, ironically, Larry is ultimately frustrated in his efforts to see Marshak as he proves too busy to see him – he is 'thinking, though I like to think, though it's not made clear, that he was listening to Danny's confiscated transistor radio/cassette.Instead, the Jefferson Airplane track is used as a framing device. I did like Danny's meeting with Marshak and Marshak's wise, slow profound utterance, which then turns out to be simply the lyrics from 'Somebody To Love'. He simply tells Danny to simply 'be a good boy'. No pious homily, but a simple admonition. He can only be responsible for himself & his actions in this uncertain world, and, in a sense, Larry already knows this when he counsels his less successful brother, Arthur.But just as Larry's life seems to settle back into some kind of normality, he receives a phone call from the doctor at the beginning (a metaphor perhaps for a spiritual examination). And once again, the uncertainty begins.And what of the whirlwind that ends the film to the soundtrack of 'Somebody to Love?' Other helpful reviewers have commented that this is the answer in an uncertain world: 'You better find somebody to love'. Love as an affirmation against uncertainty and a creation in the void (and, towards the end of the film, Larry's brother points out with bitterness, that Larry does have a wife & kids. He does indeed have somebody to love).",A Serious Man

141,J_Trex,Book of Job as told by Coen Brothers,9,23 October 2009,"Larry Gupnik is a Physics Professor in Minnesota during the late 1960's who is facing a number of different trials and tribulations, all at once. His wife wants a divorce so she can marry someone else, he's up for tenure at his university, but that is in peril due to a series of anonymous poison pen letters the tenure committee has been receiving, alleging ""moral turpitude"", his neighbor on one side of his house is planning to build an extension that encroaches on Larry's property, and his neighbor on the other side is a temptress who sun bathes in the nude, which Larry finds out while repairing his roof antennae. Larry's good for nothing brother ""Uncle Arthur"", played by Richard Kind in one of the standout roles in the film, mooches off of Larry, much to the chagrin of Larry's family. This and more is what Larry faces in the film.Larry cannot understand why God (Hashem) has afflicted him with such misfortune. He seeks the counsel of different Rabbis, who have nothing to offer by way of consolation, other than bromides that are both hilarious and pathetic.The movie is a morality tale that seems to indicate that if God exists, he certainly has a weird sense of humor. The plot seems to recall the stories of I.B. Singer in terms of Yiddish superstitious folklore. There seemed to be a sense of Imps or Demons at work, doing the bidding of Lilleth, rather than the hand of God.The Coens film work here is stunning.

143,gilligan-11,Smart and disturbing,8,20 February 2010,"One of the things I love so much about the Coen brothers is that they continue to challenge themselves (and by extension, us—the audience) and develop as filmmakers. In ""A Serious Man,"" they tackle some of the ""big"" questions—Why are we here? Why do the things that happen to us happen to us? Can we even begin to understand anything that goes in the world? And does religion or science help at all? In the hands of lesser filmmakers, asking these questions would lead to self-indulgent and pedantic movies. But the Coens choose to tell the story of Lawrence Gopnik, a modern day Job, who seems to be experiencing all that can go wrong with his family, his job, his faith, his health—he even has the Columbia House record club dunning him for payment over the phone. The script is smart, which you can always count on in a Coen brothers movie, the story is engaging, and the film itself is thought-provoking and unsettling. Heck, I'm still trying to figure out how the opening vignette relates to the main story of the film. This is a smart film for smart viewers.",A Serious Man

The Coen Brothers have done nothing but continue to WOW! audiences ever since their debut with ""Raising Arizona""......which to this day, is still my favorite Coen Brothers movie. Granted, it took me a while to finally grasp the overall concept of ""No Country For Old Men"".......because it was certainly a new breed of cinema for the Coen's. But non the less......still brilliant as all hell. Now in order for one to understand a Coen Brothers movie, you must go into it understanding that there is always more than meets the eye......both with the characters and the story. But i can easily say with complete just, that this is easily the most in depth the Coen's have ever gone. How so you ask? Well its quiet simple to explain.......this movie explains the orgins of religion, better than any movie i have ever seen in my life. The movie is chaulk full of symbolism and meaningfull side characters that could have you and your friends in constant debate for hours upon end. And in a way, that is the genius of it all.......because the movie is not preachy, instead it leaves you to figure it all out.......because, isn't that what we are trying to do? Figure out the meaning of life? Well like i said before, this movie tackles the subject the best you can possibly do. Mainly because it covers it from every angle. I cannot stress enough on how brilliantly written this movie was.........i cannot even fathom how one would even begin writing something like this, because it is so complex, but so well crafted. This is somewhat of a loose comparison, but it is almost like a Coen Brothers version of ""Pulp Fiction"".......i say that because if you totally understand all the symbolism behind that movie (Mainly the religious aspects), then in turn, you understand the characters actions even more. But this movie easily goes far deeper than that. Now you already have a deep script that is developed on so many levels......you need to film it in the right light. Well, i can also say this........this movie has not only the best cinematography i have seen in years, but easily the best cinematography i have ever seen in a Coen Brothers film........and that is saying beyond a lot. This movie has not one, but numerous sequences that are ammong the best i have ever seen on the silver screen..........at times, i would literally have to wipe away the drool from my mouth. I kid you not, it is cinematography like this, that inspires people to get into the movie industry......as well as have film professors teaching future films makers on what is right, and what is wrong. Bottom Line.........easily, hands down, the best movie i have seen this year. I cannot remember the last time a movie has affected me so much physically, and mentally. Once the credits begin to roll after an inspiring ending, i could not move from my seat. Every aspect of this movie was nothing short of astounding. The acting, the cinematography......and oh my god the writing. I will be very upset if this movie does not walk away with numerous awards. I said it once, and i will say it again.......not the only the best movie i have seen so far this year, but easily my new favorite Coen Brothers film.........it is movies like this, that inspire me to be a film maker.",A Serious Man
145,winopaul,A movie about faith.,8,12 November 2016,"I think the movie was about the son and his faith, not the cuckolded dad. Screen time does not a lead character make. The dad was the foil. He had faith in his brother, who was bat-shiat crazy. He had faith in his unfaithful wife. He had faith in Chrysler, what a dork. But his faith pays off sometimes, like when he gets tenure because he is Jewish (and because his son being raised Jewish).The daughter is a a faithless hedonist. The first rabbi has blind faith, the second cynical faith, but the last rabbi had a questioning curious faith. He didn't see taking the kid's radio so much as an opportunity to punish, as much as an opportunity to learn something.The tornado, the doctor's call, and Sy's death were an example of the Jewish phrase ""Man plans, God laughs."" I think they are saying a little faith is OK, but don't be surprised if it doesn't get you anywhere.Larry says we can't understand understand anything, the wife doesn't understand him or his physics, the daughter can't understand him, nobody understands the Mentaculus or Arthur's gambling and homosexuality, no wonder faith has to take center stage. Notice the son is more searching than bewildered, that is why he smokes pot. Notice the son has character-- he wants to pay the 20 bucks back. And note the aged Rabbi is on a constant quest to understand things, both old things and new things. He is the hero of the flick.This is a cute cheap little art film. That is all it is trying to be, so don't get cranky demanding another Oh Brother or Big Lebowski. Since it is a coming-of-age flick, it added to my theory that when you tease kids in Junior High school they become passive-aggressive sociopath computer programmers, and when you tease kids in High School they become shoot-black-people-in-the-back bully cops, but now I see, when they teased the Coens in Elementary School, we get Jewish art films.

Fargo and Burn After Reading are both phenomenal movies in their own right, while The Big Lebowski and No Country for Old Men are simply masterpieces in their respective genres. The Cohen brothers usually deal with odd, debatable, sometimes meaningless topics, in a darkly amusing manner, all of which I find greatly satisfying.A Serious Man apparently explores, wonderfully, the subject of ""Schroedinger's Cat"" and the different perspectives we attain from three separate rabbis. Maybe so.However, the way this film is presented, though original, and though the ""Cohen touch"" can be felt lingering around, is boring. The dialogue between the characters doesn't feel satisfying, there doesn't seem to be a real ""connection"" between any of the characters and as a result, it is extremely difficult to feel sympathy or hate, or even any kind of emotion towards any of the characters.The premise and the storyline really reeled me in and it sounded interesting, but the presentation was s**t! The comedic elements I felt in Burn After Reading and Big Lewbowski were God knows where, or maybe it was simply hashem punishing the viewers (have to watch the movie to get that joke!) Yes, it is original, but making something original doesn't make it good just like that. I don't understand how this movie received an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay and Picture.Maybe I'm missing something, but I doubt it. Due to my huge respect to the Cohen's, I bent over backwards to make the movie mean something, or to make it feel funny. Nothing.5/10 for some funny scenes and the rest in respect of the Cohens. And, 5 is saying A LOT!",A Serious Man
147,poc-1,What to make of this?,8,11 December 2009,"A hard working math professor, Larry Gopnik is a troubled man. His family is falling apart, his wife is running off with the therapist and his kids are wasters. His deadbeat brother is sleeping on the couch and getting into trouble with the law. A Korean student is trying to bribe him to get a passing grade and the sexy neighbour next door is sunbathing naked. Larry is a sort of combination of Job and King David living in the sixties.I am still scratching my head about this one, which is an endorsement of sort. Quite funny in places, but in the end it's too bleak to be a comedy. I liked the humor, the quirky satire on Jewish life and the characters, and I even liked the ending, after thinking about it for a bit.It's foolish to look for a message or a moral. The problem I have is that you get all psyched up to see something like ""The Big Lebowski"", a gem which was panned by the critics, but this is not it.Mainstream appeal, this does not have. There were about 8 people in the cinema when I saw it and 3 of those walked out. I have read several reviews of this movie and for the first time recommended both positive and negative ones. It is that sort of movie. As one of the characters says ""Accept the mystery"".",A Serious Man
148,dj_xand325,"The genius of the Coen Brothers leaks out in a characteristically surreal piece of restrained, black comedy. 'A Serious Man' is a cinematic marvel.",9,7 January 2010,"As the opening credits ran and I saw a mystical, fairy-tale like image of snow falling upon a desolate house in the woods, I knew I was in store for another unorthodox, bizarrely affecting film from the Coen Brothers. They dip into the ocean of satire in Burn After Reading, tease us with jet black comedy in Fargo and dazzle us with baseless fantasy in Hudsucker Proxy. These eclectic film-makers compile scripts smashing convention, showing us that life's drawbacks can be funny, celebrating dark comedy in triumphant fashion. 'A Serious Man' couldn't encapsulate this more as we're given a fly on the wall view of Larry Gopnik's (Michael Stuhlbarg) pious life implode before his eyes. 'A Serious Man' projects a cold, surreal world. Filled to the brim with plastic stock types isolating Larry in a fit of relentless mockery. This is, of course, the butt of the comedy. Gopnik's extraordinary procession of short-comings is hilarious as we watch his world plunge into a whirlwind of ill-fate. Throughout, we laugh at his constant encounters with a host of unhelpful, unsympathetic figures all differing in character. Larry has the pleasure of anti-Semitic neighbours, a socially exempt brother and a host of vacuous, unaccommodating Rabbis. Battling the effects of a failed marriage and a bitch-faced wife, Gopnik comes across Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed), a character that steals the show with his ironic, lampooning nature. Sy hijacks Larry's wife, forcing him out of his house and destroying his domestic life yet he still greets him with a calm grin, smothered with a sympathetic countenance, assuring erroneously with his droning voice that ""Everything is going to be fiiiiiine"". Sy is the Coens' emblem of deep mockery, a coarse foreshadow of the film's omniscient undertones of irony. Stuhlbarg's bumbling depiction of Larry Gopnik serves as the epicentre of a corrupting, artificial world choked with a plethora of uproarious characters. In typical Coens fashion, the film leaves us at the edge of our seats. As the credits suddenly start to roll, we're left wondering, betrayed by the incorrect thought that we knew where the film was going. The story is easing and simplistic throughout. Yet, the Coens' sudden end inspires a galaxy of thought, slapping the audience with a revelation that this picture is much more than a bit of black comedy, unveiling its daring complexity and impossible depth. Popular opinion dictates 'A Serious Man' to be an allegorical rework of the bible's Story of Job, but other more liberal critics rightfully suggest that this picture is a mere artistic flourish that should inspire many modes of interpretation. It's astonishing how the Coens continue to consistently produce such mysterious, intellectually endearing works of cinema. Starless in its cast, 'A Serious Man' is a ground-breaking piece of cinema. The Coens dish out a thought-provoking, marvellously profound film that stretches the boundaries of comedy. Not since Barton Fink, have the Coens delivered such a mentally indulgent experience. Simply Stunning. 9/10",A Serious Man
149,movedout,"""A Serious Man"" is the quintessential Coen Brothers film",8,24 February 2010,"If ""No Country for Old Men"" was their most pitch-perfect counterpoint of their idiosyncratic cinematic form, then ""A Serious Man"" is their most personal and exploratory to date. In many ways and especially in its inquiring spirit, ""A Serious Man"" is the quintessential Coen Brothers film. It resonates with the inherent absurdity of life, the harsh dualities of creation and the great cosmic prank of being. In the film's seemingly disjointed prologue set in Poland and spoken in Yiddish with accompanying subtitles, a man returning home brings home a visitor who might or might not be a dybbuk (a lost soul) to a suspecting wife, which sets the tone for the film's concerns over the danger of unexamined faith.With their latest film, they look at serious issues faced by serious people. It regards the disintegration of a late 60s Midwestern Jewish family through the experiences of soon-to-be-tenured physics professor Larry Gopnik (exquisitely played by Michael Stuhlbarg), a representation of the Biblical Job. He's a good man by all accounts. Honourable and serious in his convictions, he faces personal tribulations of a cheating wife (Sari Lennick), a traitorous friend (Fred Melamed), a kooky brother (Richard Kind) and two children who steal from him (Aaron Wolff and Jessica McManus). Add to that the temptations of a Korean exchange student (David Kang) attempting to bribe him for better grades and a promiscuous pot-smoking neighbour (Amy Landecker) who sunbathes nude. This convergence of sufferings in a short span of time lead him to analyse his perceptions on his Jewish-American faith and to reconcile the idea that man and God might not be on the same path, or whether there ever was a path to begin with.Evoking the tenor of an Anton Chekhov comic tragedy, the very notion of a tested faith against the backdrop of suburban rituals with the era's onset of American consumerist values on the warpath, is a daunting reminder of our place in the universe. The fatalistic tinge is made even more palpable in the film when considered along with the nihilistic streak set in the Coens' shared consciousness. They weave together fundamental philosophical inquiries of identity, existentialism and morality through a perfect conflation of characters. Larry primarily searches for clarity and answers through three rabbis, who attempt to comfort him with platitudes of God's will, placate him by convincing him of greater plans through droll anecdotes or just plain refuse to see him. The film asks questions through Larry that are not answerable and at its most Coen-ness, the film pleads with us to just ""accept the mystery"". What is our place? Where do I go from here? Is God guiding me? At one point Larry asks, ""Should I be nicer to people?"" The rabbi replies: ""It couldn't hurt."" Bookended by its fascinating prologue and a bravura finale, the Coens have once again made a film that is not just a showcase of a technical mastery of their profession, but a film that discusses and digests key humanistic ideals. At its core, ""A Serious Man"" resembles the primal scream silently emanating from the heart of every man and woman who, in their daily communion of navigating the finer points of compromise in their lives, come face to face with the overwhelming odds that their existence is akin to a piece of rock hurtling through space – random, unknown and searching.",A Serious Man
150,SeptumSin,A Truly Serious Drama,6,11 July 2010,"I think Woody Allen Said it best at the end of ""Picking up the Pieces"" when his character was quoted ""I'm afraid god is sending us a message, if you can't take a joke go ---- yourself"" A Serious Man is about a professor living in the sixties with his family working his way through many family crisis including marital trouble, family issues and economic strife as well as even finding himself at risk for job security. With all this happening can he still hold up to higher moral ground and religious faithfulness? This is the Coen's work to try and play out the book of Job on their terms. This film truly does live up to this story as you get to see the main character tourchered brutally through in what may be a test of his faith.The acting is well done and the characters are very real but still having that slight Zing you get from the Coen experience. The movie reminds me of the TV show that was in Idiocracy where the guy keeps getting kicked in the balls and people are supposed to laugh at it or find entertainment. I admit this is a piece that is well done but I have a hard time finding full enjoyment from the film as suffering is depicted. The film keeps up a fair pace but does drag at points so try and keep your caffeine nearby but it doesn't have to be an immediate concern.The only thing I am uncertain of is what is the beginning about? I get confused about that one at times if anyone can tell me please let me know.If you are a fan of the Coen brothers and love very dark humor much like their scene in Paris J'taime then you will truly love this film if you are looking for comedy then you should probably check somewhere else.",A Serious Man

Set in 1967 a physics professor named Larry suddenly see his life fall apart all around him. I kind of thought this might be a story about a wimpy man who learns how to be assertive and take control over his life. However, you're sucked in by the observant nature of the cinematography and you simply watch things go from bad to worse in Larry's life. His wife leaves him, his kids rebel, a student bribes him, he falls of the roof, he gets in a car wreck, and all for what?

Typical Coen brothers fanfare and those that love him will treasure this since the Coen's trademark quirkily intense style shines through. Coens are masters of suspense like present day Hitchcock and they make a scene of a boy getting a bar-mitzvah an overwhelmingly intense experience. An experience which generates a weird amusement since you wonder why or how you become on the edge of your seat with your heart racing from something so simple and silly. Typical Coen brother's idiosyncratic very quirky looking characters radiate this movie. Also present is their overriding ominously, murky/funny themes that amuse, horrify and make laugh in the same instant.It is another dark comedy about a normal man who can't help but be honest in his dealings with the quirky, borderline wacky people around him. If you've ever had the feeling that everyone around you was a little nuts or off you'll relate. One minor calamity after another befalls him and he fruitlessly seeks out advice from Rabbis and attorneys. The issues that plagues him are the typical suburban clichés of divorce, troublesome children, barriers for career advancement and annoying or delightfully tempting neighbors, however, there is a prevalent Jewish folklore, superstitions and mentally that take it slightly above the cliché subject matter. Those amused by the stereotypical Jewish mentality will get a kick out of this. The pace was a little slow and there isn't much of an overall story but contained are some brilliant, masterfully executed scenes and fun side stories which give the movie its much needed booster shot. These directors seem to be able to make anything intense. As in some of Coen brother's movies there seems to be some mysterious ill-omened, dark meaning and this was the case here.

As the credits rightly claim, no Jews were injured in the making of the film: the Coen brothers' latest offering is more comedy than existential comedy, more South Park cynicism than dark night of the soul, more ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" (light) than ""No Country for Old Men,"" and it works on that level. Forget all the nonsense being spouted about Job. Lawrence Gopnik, the protagonist, isn't an Old Testament character dressed up as a physics professor. He's a conventional schlemiel who has no more understanding of the physical world than the shtetl farmer pictured in the opening sequence has of dybbuks.

I like a good denouement phase as will as the next guy but when you have to have someone else explain it in order to appreciate it, it morphs into something else.

On the surface it seems like a quirky comedy of manners smashed together with an ethnic period piece. Look deeper and it's actually a very unsettling and disturbing treatise on fate, karma and the pointlessness of life in general. It opens with a creepy scene from long ago that foreshadows what is to come and ends with one of the most ominous scenes in recent film history. A lot of people will dismiss it and say there is nothing to the movie, but they would be dead wrong. You might be vehemently opposed to the idea of life being ultimately meaningless, but the fact that it's probably true is what makes this film that more effective and a hard pill to swallow for some folks.

Those films were made to beat people over the head emotionally and make money. Like ""Barton Fink,"" ""Fargo"" and ""The Big Lebowski,"" this film was make to make people squirm.As with those mighty ""little"" films, ""ASM"" is about life turned upside down again and again (and =shaken=, not stirred) because the protagonists are stuck in the dense, black-or-white, all-or-nothing belief and value systems of their cultures. As in those films, the protagonist here is mystified at the buckets of chaos raining down on him because he can only perceive life from =within= a paradigm of which he is wholly unaware. Yet, as in chaos theory, there's an obvious order to the whole package... if one looks for it.In this case (and here's the spoiler), it's that Larry Gopnik cannot see the world in any other fashion than through the eyes of an orthodox Jew in pre-gange (read pre-pseudo-""enlightenment""), 1967 Minneapolis. He is so encapsulated in the values and beliefs of his surrounding culture that it does not occur to him to seek other interpretations of his deepening dilemmas. It is as though he is a member of some rural mind-control cult. Poor, helpless (and hopeless) Larry looks for answers in a faith he has never really put to the test before. Everyone he turns to smothers him with the assumptions, assertions and convictions of a legalistic and absolutistic culture... a culture that espouses unquestioning acceptance of the mysterious, arbitrary and alternately rescuing and persecuting Hebrew god of the Pentatuch. ""Life is awful, and then you die and go who knows where?"" everyone seems to tell him. (The orthodox Jew has no concept of heaven, I guess; and hell is accepted as right here on earth.)

JJ's Verdict: Like the majority of the Coen brother's films, A Serious Man doesn't really follow a plot or storyline. It is more just a series of interconnecting events that then lead to a sharp, to- the-point ending, which can be taken in many different ways.A Serious Man is set in 1960's Midwestern America and focuses on Larry Gopnik, a Jewish physics professor. The film follows his life as small and mainly insignificant events all add up to big and significant and his life sinks into darkness and misery. The film is full of larger than life and annoying (in the circumstances) characters brilliantly invented by the Coen brothers. Larry Gopnik is serious man. He just wants a peaceful life but his dysfunctional family halts this. The Coen brothers manage to create an amazing world in which Larry seems the only normal person. His wife is manipulative, demanding and secretive. She decides to divorce Larry and forces him to agree. Her lover, Sy Ableman, is arrogant and totally in your face. The fact that everyone around town is shocked that his wife would pick Sy Ableman over him is timeless. His son, nearing Barmitzvah age, is sweary, drug-taking and expects his father to do everything for him and his daughter is moody, shouty and constantly steals money from her father's wallet. To make matters worse he has to cope with his brother 'Uncle 'Albert who is completely anti-social and gay (illegal in the 60's).Larry also has tensions at work as his Asian student attempts to bribe him so that his marks can rise. His job is constantly under threat and is visited daily by a member of the tenure committee who asks him about life and then jumps some comment about him being sacked or not on him. One of his neighbours is sexy and seductive and Larry has to cope with fending her off despite his feelings for him and the other neighbour is genuinely scary and the two are always arguing about the boundary line between their homes. Michel Stuhlbarg puts in a career best performance as Larry and the rest of the cast, although mainly unknown debutants are incredibly good. The Coen brothers recreation of 1960's suburban Jewish America is just superb as is cinematographer Roger Deakins efforts. It seems that only Joel and Ethan Coen can create comedy in even the darkest moments and make their main characters go through complete hell right from start to finish. This is what the first two third's of the film is. Perfectly timed black comedy. It's just a shame that towards the end, the Coen brothers get too bogged down in giving this film a meaning when really; the audience doesn't need it (before this they had a near perfect film). Being about a Jewish man, they try to add Jewish (and also Christian) meanings and morals, which can just confuse the hell out of people with a lack of theological knowledge. Even for someone of the faith, I struggled to grasp a good concept of it. You can just watch it as it is on the surface though; another brilliant black comedy film from the Coen brothers.",A Serious Man

Some friends may be asking you for their $12 back. Its bleak outlook is definitely for minority tastes.There are black comedies and then there are really black comedies and this falls in the latter category. One of the best black comedies ever made was the Coen brothers' Fargo and, while the humour was very dark, there were some very positive characters in the movie. The female Sheriff, played by Frances McDormand, is even heroic and her relationship with her husband is the definition of charming. But there is nothing like that in Serious Man. The movie is unrelenting in it's darkness. You can make a movie that is this dark and still have it be entertaining, but there have to be other elements to compensate. For example, the cult movie Erasorhead is also very dark, but it's filled with mesmerizing images. Unfortunately, Serious Man started to bore me about halfway through. I did laugh at times, but I also wanted the movie to be over with so I could escape.I would also have to wonder about what the message is of this movie. I'm not Jewish, so I can't say I was offended by the film. However, I wondered as I watched the movie, what is being attacked here? Perhaps it was just an attack on the repressiveness of religion, but it felt as much as an attack on Jewish culture in general. The movie takes place in the past, which perhaps acts as a buffer to criticism of being anti-Jewish. Woody Allen has also satirized Jewish culture, but it's been in small doses. In Serious Man this is overwhelming.I would say the biggest problem, is the movie is simply not funny enough to compensate for the depressing atmosphere. If you hang around to the very end credits you'll see the declaration: ""No Jews were harmed in the making of this movie"". That might be the funniest line of the entire film.",A Serious Man

In fact, this is (at least in my opinion) their best film in years, at least since Fargo, and maybe since Raising Arizona and my personal fave, Blood Simple.It may be all the Yiddish and Jewish idiom, the stuff they grew up with. Although my wife hated the movie because (being Jewish) she hated that all the (Jewish) characters were so obnoxious or worse. (I pointed out that ALL the characters in this movie were obnoxious or worse - except the poor shlub at the center of the storm. Besides, ALL Coen Brothers movies are filled with characters who are obnoxious or worse. At least no one was flipping a coin to see who lives or dies.) What this movie has that some of their most recent works miss is that the humor, black and depressing though it is, rings true. It's totally unforced. This is their own youth translated to film. The three rabbis' words of wisdom, especially the wisdom of the ancient rabbi, the close ups of people kvetching and kvelling, and especially the bar mitzvah boy scene, terrific, is most obviously the two of them going through the ritual.Wonderful acting, BTW. Michael Stuhlbarg as the shlub, Adam Arkin as the oily and too-old law firm ""associate,"" Richard Kind as the hero's mondo bizarro brother, and Fred Melamed as one of the most unctious, offensive adulterers in screen history.And I found myself at the end (without spoiling) wondering: Is it really all about sh*t happens, all beyond our control? Or is a brighter day coming? Or are we just fooling ourselves? And - ultimately - does what we do ourselves make any damn difference at all? I'm sure the Coen Brothers have an answer for each of these questions, but it's probably - just like the point of the second rabbi's ""engraved tooth"" story - ""whatever....""",A Serious Man
168,Hairy_Lime,Why doesn't he just give us a written?,10,1 December 2009,"My first impression of the new Coen Bros movie, A Serious Man....The plot is simple. It is the story of a man who finds himself utterly unprepared for his midterm exam. He has studied his teacher's stories, but not the reality behind them: he was unaware that there was going to be math involved, even though the whole point of the stories is to illustrate the math - it's the math that really matters. He was also under the impression that it was going to be open book.In his desperation, he tries to crib from the exams of his fellow students, only to discover they don't have any of the answers either. Or if they do, their blue book contains nothing but indecipherable gibberish. He's afraid that failing the exam will cause his scholarship to be revoked. Finally, with it all falling apart on him, he turns to brazen cheating, and gets caught. And discovers that, while consequences may not necessarily have actions, actions most definitely have consequences.Or perhaps not; perhaps that's too easy of a metaphor. What A Serious Man is, besides being one of the handful of best movies of the decade, is an examination of a world where, if God is present, he sure the Hell isn't showing himself to us; he left on sabbatical before the exam and the proctors he left behind can do no more than point to the parking lot.I seem to have returned to my perhaps inappropriate metaphor. But then, I'm still turning the movie over in my mind. Perhaps it is better just to point out a few of the many, many joys the movie contains: typically sparkling dialog - it is the Coens - tremendous performances, especially by Michael Stuhlbarg, perfectly drawn and cast minor characters, a great shaggy dog (their best since Lebowski which was shaggy dog from first to last) that wanders into the middle of the movie and stays on the edge of the consciousness like it might, finally, actually mean something... maybe. An ending that is perfect for all those people who thought the resolution to No Country for Old Men was too pat, predictable and neatly wrapped up. And, oddly enough, a beginning that is its equal. The movie's plotting is typically ingenious, and provides a hidden circularity to the whole picture - the movie begins with a man who may be a Dybbuk and ends with a man who may be Schroedinger's Cat. It is also uproariously funny, right through to the ending credits.And perhaps maybe, just maybe, it gives us the answer to the whole damn thing - an answer given to us by, of all people, Mike Yanagita.",A Serious Man
169,colin_coyne,Very disappointing ...,4,17 November 2009,"After seeing and enjoying previous really good Coen Brothers films (""Fargo"", ""No Country for old men"", ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Blood Simple""), I was really looking forwards to seeing ""A SERIOUS MAN"",  unfortunately however, I feel this was a film that failed on so many fronts  A SERIOUS MAN is the story of a teacher / professor at a school that is going through a crisis both with his home life and his professional life ... things are falling apart all over  from his wife that wants to leave him, to a dysfunctional brother who has way overstayed his welcome  to accusations of malpractice in school .. to the neighbour from hell  This is a very dark comedy  with an over-abundance (much, too much already) Jewish references  that (unless you are knowledgeable of that faith) a lot of the subtleties and jokes just pass you by  although, it should be mentioned that there are some very comic moments  (which tended to be more visual humour than dialogue) I really felt quite disappointed with this movie – especially with the totally meaningless ending  I felt I had wasted my time watching this film, and I (personally) really can't recommend it – as it would have such a limited audience that would appreciate it.I think that the heavy Jewish overtones – throughout the entire film  were very burdensome indeed and may seriously impact or restrict the number of people that will eventually take to this movie  perhaps pushing it to an early cult status ... but it would be a very small cult that could hold it's meetings in a phone box ...",A Serious Man
170,jefadlm-1,I and my 3 companions did not appreciate this movie.,1,4 December 2009,"I feel that here i saw a (possible) divide of Jewish/Gentile opinion/appreciation. From the first frames spoken in thankfully translated tongue in cheek Shtetel era Yiddish, this did not gel for me or my 3 Jewish companions. Parody can be very funny, this was i agree darkly funny (for some folk) humour. As we left the theatre, having all 4 of us sit right through to the very last credits on my insistence, we spoke with 2/ 30 something women, one of whom looked British and her friend who was (i am guessing) Chinese or Korean and had a good command of the language. Without hesitation they both enjoyed it immensely. Loved the black humour and got the messages loud and clear. They did say that they had a little knowledge of Jews and Jewish culture. (the cinema is in a mixed affluent Jewish/Gentile area of North London.) Now i accept that these 2 women are not an accurate survey, that said, having spoken with others, i wonder if this is a British Jews view, as opposed to a North American view? BTW the English Jewish Chronicle, (which i rarely read due to it's sensationalism and inaccuracies) whose review i have not read, apparently lambasted the film completely, so i am told. Final comment, i spoke with an English woman of an African country who also knows a little about Jews. She told me that viewing the trail of Serious Man made her cringe and she has no intention of going to see it. I just briefly looked re comments on Schroedingers cat, about which i know very little or less!! That said, i am sure i am not alone in my ignorance.In my view, this adds to my displeasure of the movie. For the simple reason that the myriad of jokes and symbols for those in the know all makes for great fun, FOR THEM, wonderful, thereby excluding (possibly) a wider appreciative audience. As soon as i have sufficient time i will read the huge list of comments. So far reference to the cat, it seems to me, has qualified my reasoning for the lack of pleasure that some audience will come away with.That said, those 3 women i refer to above, i would not have thought they would be able to grapple with the cat or, (if there is any mention in the movie)of Kabbalah??",A Serious Man

173,Caribstu,Fargo It 'aint,2,14 April 2010,"A serious man I've read many of the reviews already posted. The deep theological arguments, references to Schrodinger's cat, the relationship to the story of Job. All of this i understand and i see withing the film, and as a Christian who is well versed in the Old Testament, or Torah, i get the Job references. However, thats not what i had in mind when i sat down to watch this film. Rather like dissecting an art-house movie it's all rather pompous and self inflating.So forgetting the theology lessons, how is it as a film? The Cohen brothers. You either get them or you don't. A little on the dark side of humour, personally I do. I like their films very much and would go as far as to say ""Fargo"" is absolutely one of my all time favourite films. Oh yar. So when A serious man came out on DVD I was quick to get hold of a copy. On the box cover it said ""Audaciously funny, original and resonant"" Entertainment Weekly.It's set in a suburban USA town in the early 60's, and centers around the lives of a Jewish family living in a Jewish community. The father, a professor at a local college, is going through the trials of Job, his wife a high maintenance annoyingly vocal woman, is tormenting him at a time he most needs support, their teenage daughter is narcissistic self obsessed and the son is struggling to find his identity, drifting off in Hebrew class, smoking weed and listening to Grace Slick.For me this film was immensely sad, as you would expect Job's life to be. Everything which could go wrong does and he continually spirals downward in a supreme test of faith. It had, however none of the humour I was expecting and I love that famously dry, dark, sarcastic Jewish humour. The Cohen's certainly missed the mark with this one. It plods along at such a slow pace it's like a one legged horse pulling a fully laden cart up a steep hill, frustratingly slow and painful to watch. Unless you're Jewish or well versed in the Old Testament, the little 'in' jokes just aren't funny, not even in the normal dark humour way the Cohen's are famous for. It is indeed a completely and utterly boring, nothingness so extremely disappointing waste of time. I would go as far as to say that even if your Jewish it's not funny, perhaps if your Jewish and American and born in the 50's it might be different, it might be hysterical, may even be the ""Audaciously funny, original and resonant"" film the Entertainment Weekly claims it to be. But that's a pretty limited demographic. I found that the only thing I was interested in was the wonderfully shot cinematography and the 60's soundtrack. Honestly though I think the Cohen's had way too much time on their hands, way too much money to spend and decided to make an over indulgent film to satisfy themselves and a very minority audience, for the rest of us, I think we just got ripped off.",A Serious Man
174,angie_l,When the truth is found to be lies..................,10,13 February 2010,"Good movie, I laughed out loud a few times. The movie deals with the dangers of inaction and the consequence of action.This entire review is SPOILERS, lots and lots...A Serious Man is about trying to find meaning in life especially where everything seems random. The movie actually can feel the same way. The year is 1967 and Larry Gopnik is a middle-aged college physics professor up for tenure who is a decent man. He has a house, a wife, 2 children, and a good job.The opening scene, which may seem unrelated, occurred many years ago. A man has encountered a person who is known to be dead. When he enters their home, the wife throws a knife in him. Either a dybbuk (spirit) has entered a home and cursed the family or perhaps a women has just assaulted an innocent man. The wife is superstitious, to her a dybbuk brought them a curse. Her husband, presumably a serious man, sees him as clearly alive and his wife just killed him. I see this two ways. One, either the wife has cursed the (Larry's?)family for her belief, which leads her to killing an innocent person, or the man has cursed the family with his disbelief, which allowed an evil spirit into the house, which is right? Doesn't matter! Second is the Schrodinger paradox. The paradox basically pokes holes in quantum mechanics saying that if a cat's life is determined on subatomic particles that are in an indefinite state, the cat would have to be both dead and alive. Perhaps, the supposed houseguest is in fact the cat, both dybbuk and man.The story begins with Larry's son listening to Jefferson Airplane's Somebody to Love on a radio which gets confiscated. Larry is getting a physical and later teaches the Schrodinger paradox. After which a Korean student tries to bribe him for a passing grade to keep his scholarship. The conversation they later have is actually the Coen's talking directly to the audience. They tell us via Larry that the stories are just fables for the math, the story is a front to reveal the truth. You can't understand the events of the movie without actually understanding the movie, slick Coen's real slick. Larry tries to give the money back but the student refuses using confused logic. He is later threatened by the student's father who is similar to the son in logic. In a conversation with the student, Larry states emphatically that in his office actions always have consequences both physically and morally.Larry's home life consists of a wife who wants a divorce, a daughter who is preoccupied with washing her hair and a son who is studying for his bar mitzvahs with a penchant for marijuana. His odd brother who has overstayed his welcome lives with him and monopolizes the bathroom to the daughters disgruntlement. The family walks all over him. The wife asks for a divorce because she wants to remarry and treats Larry as if he is the problem. The wife's boyfriend, Sy, actually wants them to get a Jewish annulment so they can wed in the church. The wife and boyfriend, Sy, then ask Larry to move out of the house and refuse when Larry gives the more reasonable alternative of the wife moving in with the boyfriend. Result, Larry moves out.Larry is a man of inaction. He doesn't help the brother, he doesn't fight the wife, and he doesn't pursue further the Korean bribe. The first consequence happens and it isn't to Larry because he hasn't taken action. Larry and the wife's boyfriend Sy are both in car accidents simultaneously. Larry has a minor fender bender while driving straight. Sy who is turning left is killed. Sy has taken immoral action, turning left, and has suffered the consequences. Larry still driving straight continues his inaction by even paying for Sy's funeral and therefore has no consequences.Larry is desperate trying to find what God is saying with these random bad events. He is told repeatedly to talk to the Rabbi so he does seeking answers. There are three Rabbi's in the movie. Youth says that he is looking through weathered eyes and to try a fresh perspective (which is later given by the brother). Middle-aged Rabbi tells him that he is not meant to understand the actions of God. (He inadvertently tells us that life is pointless.) Old-aged Rabbi, Marshak (?), won't talk to him. He only talks to the boys on their bar mitzvahs. None have any answer.There is a scene early on where Larry is on the roof of the house and basically for a moment we do get God's perspective. There are more instances of inaction and not just his but the wife's and Korean's. He does start to fantasize about being active. Larry is also contrasted with a neighbor that is a man of action who is never punished for them presumably because he isn't Jewish.In the end there are two main points. Larry's son enters Rabbi Marshak's large office after his Bar Mitzvah. Marshak's office is in disarray from a struggle of the mind. I think we get the Coen's directly talking to the audience again and finally the answer that Larry and the Rabbi Marshak have been looking for. Marshak recites the lyrics of Jefferson Airplane, ""When the truth is found to be lies, and all the joy within you dies."" He returns the radio to Larry's son and instructs him to be a good boy. That's it, life is meaningless and be good.The second point: Larry is beyond desperate from all of these unfortunate events. He finally commits an action and Larry you said it, all actions have consequences, especially in your office. The curse then continues.",A Serious Man
175,steve-ruzicka,"Puzzled, to say the least",5,29 April 2010,"This movie reminds me of a visit to a modern art gallery some years ago. I thought the paintings were terrible and if there was any meaning to it, I could not find it. I met a critic, well renowned, who explained me in pompous and over-intellectual terms, why these all were a chef d'oeuvre. Here I am, trying to make sense of ""A Serious Man"". Is it a black comedy filled with Jewish humor? Is it a search into deep religion and the unknown paths of God? Or is it a disguised acid criticism of a type of Jewish community? Reading the many positive comments did not help. On a closing note, Rene Magritte was considered the leading surrealist painter in Belgium but was snubbed by his Parisian surrealist colleagues and ""friends"". For his personal amusement and maybe revenge, he painted provocative bad surreal paintings, exhibited in a Paris gallery. Did the Coen brothers attempted something similar, getting square with part of the Jewish community? Who knows ... God maybe?",A Serious Man
176,dimitrisalomao,Good,7,22 March 2010,"The Coen Brothers are one of the best filmmakers still working (And between the best of all time), so in a way this movie impressed, because it is a good film, but it was also disappointing, because I expected so much more from them.The movie tells the story of a Jewish physics professor whose staid and stable life slowly begins to unravel after his wife announces that she's leaving him. As if the failure of his longtime marriage wasn't enough for Larry Gopnik (Stuhlbarg) to contend with, now his socially inept brother refuses to move out of the house as well. Larry is a modest man of science. Up to this point, his life has been uneventful at best, but things are about to get interesting.After making the expectacular ""No Contry For Old Men"", they made the not as great ""Burn After Reading"", so was expected from them a better movie than their last one, the result is equal, this movie is equally good as ""Burn After Reading"".As we all expected, the movie is almost perfect in a technical way, it's just not perfect because some of the jokes doesn't work, and some supposedly funny moments, are not that good. The problem of the movie is that, because of its incredible existential dilemmas, and religious doubts, it's a waste to mix it with simple comic moments, although it gives us The Coen Brothers's charm to the movie. But notice the difference between the plot of ""Burn After Reading"" and ""A Serious Man"", the last one is much deeper and intelligent.The Acting is great, and as usual in a Coens's film, the supporting actors, even small appearances, really stand out, like Marshak's secretary, Clive and Clive's father, and the young rabbi. There's a particular scene that is more than hilarious, it's the scene of the discussion between Gopnik and Clive's father. There's is the overwhelmed Jew, and the meddler American... (Although it may try to show a political opinion that I don't agree, it was a great perception of different cultures).Verdict: The Coen Brothers made another great movie, and although it may not be as good as their best movies, it still worth watching.",A Serious Man
177,bobt145,Life As a Paradox,9,28 October 2009,"...or is that a pair of docs? This is a difficult movie to capture in a review, so much so, that as a Coen brothers fan I was mislead a bit by what I read before seeing it.Ebert and such had prepared me for a drama. I suppose it is that too, but much more, A Serious Man is filled with warmth and humor and insight.If your idea of a damn good film is plot and resolution, you've come to the wrong temple. If you enjoy a film that grabs your soul and wakes you in the middle of the night with wonder, ah, then this one is for you.I can see the reviewers paradox. I don't want to reveal one scene, so I'll try it from the backside, so to speak.It's about a family man entering one of those swirling vortexes that life can throw at you from time to time where so many problems come at once that it becomes overwhelming.The film is beautifully framed by a parable in Yiddish, the traditions of modern Judaism and the wisdom of three rabbis.But you don't have to be Jewish. Giggle. Just alive.By the time the advice and thoughts of the aging, third rabbi are slowly revealed, with their marvelous storytelling, the Coens will have given you such insight that you will not only understand the rabbi's wisdom, you will be able to know the exact words he is saying as he says them.Now that's a true gift from any filmmaker.Is this their cosmic joke? Could be.We traveled almost an hour to see it and it is well worthwhile, whatever your theater charges for tickets, even if they're free, as ours were.",A Serious Man
178,elle_kittyca,"Ambiguous, philosophical, subtle. Not for everyone.",8,28 December 2015,"I generally write short reviews to offer a contrasting opinion to movies that I think are rated too high. I was pleasantly surprised to find this movie really interesting and more enjoyable that its current rating of 7 suggests. Generally speaking, I like a movie to be coherent, linear, and consistent, and this movie was not always any of those things. According to most of my criteria, it should have annoyed me, but it mostly didn't. This may not be a movie for everyone however. Its a dark comedy, and it raises questions that it does not answer, mostly about the unreliability of there being a connection between one's actions and the outcome. Of note, I study philosophy, and so the Kafkaesque nature of human life and the theological questions this movie asks are of specific interest to me. This movie will not be for everyone. If you don't like Jewish culture, it might be annoying. The only scene I found annoying myself, is the opening scene which i think depicts Russian Jews telling a folk tale, which, while thematically linked to the movie, is not consistent with the time and place of the rest of the movie. The movie is not fast moving, the laughs are not ""out loud,"" and the meaning is ambiguous. It might be recommend for those interested in existential issues, an interest in theological questions, and a misanthropic streak.",A Serious Man
179,pjpaix,Yet another take on this film,9,1 November 2009,"As usual with the Coen brothers, the reviews are all over the place - from ""I hated it"" to ""It's a work of genius"". (I happen to subscribe to the latter). And, as usual with them, the interpretations are all over the place, though many reviewers seem to focus on the Coens' view of life as nasty, brutish and short.But because the Coens are able to weave so many meanings into their films, I think I ought to point out a thread that I've not seen anyone discuss. Specifically, one could make the argument that every single awful thing that befalls Larry Gopnik - with exception of the final irrevocable disasters - could have been prevented. Go right down the line: giving an ""F"" to a student because he understood only the stories and not the math (like Einstein...); watching a neighbor take more and more of his yard from him; a son and daughter living in another world from him; a brother who refuses to move out of the house; a wife who leaves him for a ""serious man"" - in all of these trials and tribulations, Larry Gopnik could've taken control. Taken in this light, the opening Yiddish folk tale can easily be interpreted as showing the correct way to deal with evil: stab it in the heart, push it out of the house and then get on with life.What then to say about the two final - and irrevocable - verdicts, one for Larry and one for his son? While they work as typical Coen over-the-top finales, they also represent what Anton Chigurh represented in ""No country..."": the occasional, truly arbitrary, visitation of evil or death.",A Serious Man

Because sometime at some point, as the ""serious man ""finds out, life is going to kick our ass. Religions don't understand anything anymore than our hero of the film does. We are all just guessing. That's what this movie is about. It's pretty brilliant, acerbic, and downright cynical.

181,daryl42-1,Don't take this movie too seriously.,9,18 February 2010,"9.2""I never did anything"", says Lawrence Gopnik all throughout the film. A Serious Man is about the misadventures of a Jewish middle-aged American male. He lives in the suburbs, works as a physics professor at a university, and leads a humble and quiet life. But soon, his life starts to fall apart, one piece at a time, leaving him naked, and questioning what his life was in the first place, and where it should go from there.A Serious Man tells the story from Gopnik's perspective. We see how he views and reacts to events, good or bad, in his life. Ultimately, one thing that is a constant in the story, is that Gopnik doesn't really know who the people around him truly are. And he probably doesn't have a very good idea of who he is either. All the people closest to him all have secrets. Yet, when he finds out about them, he takes it easy. He takes in all the news with simplicity. However, he doesn't fare so well when things happen to him. He symbolically cries in confusion, like a baby.The beginning parts of the film coincide with the latter parts of the film. I won't go into detail, but early on he gives moral advice to a student. Later on in the film, that same advice comes back to bite him. There are things that happen early on that act as a seed for what happens at the end of the film. The things that happen in the middle of the film, have no real consequence on his life. This makes the setup of the film very interesting.All throughout most of the film, the skies of suburban Minnesota are clear and blue. With all the events happening in Gopnik's life, the skies remain that way. The film paints a very serene picture of quiet, calm and peaceful suburban life. Maybe the 60's were simpler, but I got a nice calm feeling from the film's atmosphere. The grass is green, the skies are blue. And whats lacking in this environment is red blood, which we see so much in movies. Even in these types of settings. Everything feels normal in the movie, and when something that isn't normal is introduced, it feels genuinely weird, scary or wrong. One thing that I didn't like about the movie, are shock scenes that seem to be real, and you want them to be, but they aren't. And in a movie where you expect the expected, I got left feeling a bit cheated out with these scenes. One other little thing about the movie that I noticed, is that the prologue scene, which takes place long before the main story does, is presented in 1.33:1. The only reason I can come up for this is that the Coen Brothers wanted the scene to feel old. The Coen brothers have talent. This could have been a mediocre film about soul-searching and American life. Instead, it's what we would call nowadays ""art"". From the great use of rock music, to its original music, combined with clever editing and moody shots, A Serious Man is a seriously good movie. I felt like I was in the movie, and it felt like the characters were real.From beginning to end you will sympathize with Lawrence Gopnik, and you will wish that he stood up for himself more often. And in the end, you will see that his words of wisdom rang true. He was a very good role model for people, very forgiving, very understanding, but he didn't seem to apply that to his own life. To himself. And if you're expecting a Hollywood rock and roll ending... don't. Don't because A Serious Man is a serious movie, and it tries to be realistic. And don't because this is a Coen brothers movie.",A Serious Man
182,cl777,A Serious Man but only an Above Average Movie,7,18 January 2010,"A Serious Man, the Coen brother's latest film- not to be confused with A Single Man or with Solitary Man, also coming out this season- is a dark comedy set in the 1960's centering on Larry Gopnik, a mathematics and physics professor trying to cope with his rapidly deteriorating life. To say that things are falling apart is an understatement.His wife decides to leave him and during an intervention with Larry and her new lover (the ""serious man"" from the title no less), explains to him that it would be best if he moved into a motel although she admits he has done nothing wrong. In addition, he has trouble at work with a Korean student who is trying to bribe him, looming financial woes, a brother who has moved in with the family and gets into major legal trouble, a son who seems like all he enjoys is smoking pot and only calls him to fix the TV or radio, and a daughter who only wants to go to clubs and wash her hair.Larry is plagued by existential issues of wondering why all of this is happening to him and seeks help from three different rabbis. Why is ""Hashem"" (God) doing this to him? He is a good man. Why does Hashem think he deserves this? Larry is tormented. He is a smart man but clearly nothing is working out for him in life. He turns to Judaism for solutions and answers but finds no solace.Larry's troubles are morbidly humorous and definitely bizarre as one would expect from the Coens. The opening scene of the movie is probably the weirdest of all, a prologue entirely in Yiddish shows a husband and wife arguing over whether their evening visitor is a man or an evil spirit, or ""Dybbuk!!!"" (you have to see it to understand). Throughout the film there are many scenes showing Jewish traditions and rituals, most are portrayed with irony and showcase a lot of neuroticism. One can imagine that the Coens lived through some of these moments themselves and that this is in more ways than one autobiographical, a return to the roots.Although the movie raises some interesting philosophical and theological issues, I enjoyed it a lot less than Burn After Reading which I thought was laugh out loud funny, or No Country for Old Men whose extremely impressive acting, haunting score and uniqueness are no match to Serious Man. This movie has absurd, amusing, off beat and tragic moments too but it failed to captivate me. There is also no closure at the end which bothered Fabio more than it did me. I think it meant that life simply goes on but unfortunately I wasn't interested enough to really dwell on it.My rating: 7 Fabio's: 6 Total score: 13 For more daily reviews please visit and become a follower at: http://paulinasmovies.blogspot.com",A Serious Man
183,zadkine,Almost as good as Good as Gold,10,6 October 2009,"Blending tragedy and humor, the Coen brothers, like Joseph Heller and Vonnegut, explore our post-WW2 modern wasteland, highlighting the bankruptcy of language, the failures of religion, and the hopelessness of finding happiness via the banalities of middle-class life. When it's funny, it's very, very funny, biting and true. Larry Gopnik is the Yossarian of St. Louis Park (without the violent fantasies). A nice coincidence: Yossarian was played by Alan Arkin, in Mike Nichols' version of ""Catch-22"". And his son, Adam, plays Gopnik's lawyer. I wish the Coens would tackle ""Something Happened"" or even better, ""Good as Gold"", they'd get it right. No one making movies today has a better ear for the meaninglessness of most modern conversation, how no matter how hard we try, much of what we say makes very little sense. Gopnik's complete inability to understand what anyone is saying, or to be understood, is terribly funny and familiar, and terribly depressing. I'd also like to see what they'd do with ""Slaughterhouse-Five"", another ""entertaining"" look at at our knack for hurting each other.",A Serious Man

Not a dislike...just a resounding disquiet in my heart that yearned to know more. A need to understand what it was all leading up to.When I finally left the theater with the other few stragglers (the theater had been more than half full at this advanced screening in L.A. hosted by L.A.Magazine) there was a young Jewish woman in the lobby loudly complaining to one of the ushers that it was the worst movie she'd ever seen. She continued to complain (not yelling, but at full volume) about it while leaving the theater (she and her date were right behind me), and from what I could understand didn't like anything leading up to the end, and was let down when the ending didn't tie everything up with a neat little bow.I, on the other hand, really enjoyed everything leading up to the ending. It was funny, observant, touching, and insightful. The acting and characters were superb, and it was beautiful to look at. Actually, it was quite similar to ""Barton Fink"", in that the lead character is quite a trod-upon push-over, and the ending enigmatic, yet seeming to imply a deeper connection to the world...though the light at the end of the tunnel is further and further off. The Coens seem to be leading up to something big in the screenplay, hinting at messages from God, and deeper meaning behind math and physics (almost a response to ""Pi""), which may be why the young woman found it so disappointing. The Coens have no summation of answers for us.",A Serious Man

Do not believe any of them. This is a film about the director and writer being sadistic...first to the protagonist in the movie, then finally to the viewing audience. The major problem with that is people are desperate to appear smart, so they have to see something deep and important in a movie. So the Coens gets all sorts of awards and praise for this incomplete, lazy piece of trash.

He is a physics professor facing a divorce, bribery from one of his students, his son's constant complaining about the T.V. not working, and the antics of his brother. The Coen Brothers have made a wonderfully dry and personal movie about the 70's. The cinematography is captivating, and the dialogue is very sharp and humorous. The script is wonderfully observant and witty, and is one of the biggest achievements of the film. Oscar nominations for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay were highly deserved, and I even think it deserved to win the latter. Many people will find the ending to be bizarre and discomforting. That said, A Serious Man is very underrated, and deserves to be remembered.",A Serious Man
188,per-181,2 hours mostly wasted,2,31 July 2011,"The Coen brothers are responsible for at least three of my ten best films of all time, but this is not one of those films. It is labeled as a comedy, which is stretching the truth a bit. OK, a few scenes are very funny in the quirky Coen tradition, but 90 % of the time it's all about religion. If you're Jewish, it might be of some interest, but to those of us who realise that organised religion - whatever the faith – is just a big hoax to gain and retain power, it's just b-o-r-i-n-g. Way to deep! The ""jiddisch folktale"" that opens the movie even made me angry. The brothers confess that it has nothing whatsoever to do with the story – so why put it in there? Pure garbage! And why do the Coen brothers end their movies by just randomly turning off the camera these days? We saw it first in ""No country for old men"" – which was a superb film right up to the totally abrupt ending, and they do it again here.On the plus side, the cinematography and set designs are top notch, and the actors do a good job with the material they have been given. But if you see the words ""Coen brothers comedy"" and expect a masterpiece like The Big Lebowski or Burn After Reading, you will be very disappointed.",A Serious Man
189,Cinemadharma,"Expect to not fully know what it all means, and in doing so you'll completely get the meaning.",8,28 October 2009,"This is wonderfully detailed strangeness from the Coen Brothers, set in a typical Jewish-American community in the 1960's. You will undoubtedly leave the theater wondering what the meaning of this film is, and therein lies the genius of the film. See, Jewish folk have a way of telling stories that are kind of like extremely overly-detailed Zen koans, in the way that they will leave you with more questions than answers.Thru its storytelling style and main character, the film asks the same question over and over again: Why do bad things keep happening to me? What is God's plan for me? What is 'He' trying to tell me? But, in the film, as in life we never get clear answers to these questions.Larry Gopnik is a physics teacher who teaches his students about the 'uncertainty principal', which basically states that the more precisely one property is known, the less precisely the other can be known. In religious terms, I think that this refers to the deeper relationship you have with God, the less you understand 'His' plan – but, despite that uncertainty, you trust it anyway. That trust in certain uncertainty is what is known as faith. In non-religious terms, the more you understand about the scientific nature of the universe, the less you understand about your place in it – and again you are left with that same sense of certain uncertainty.If you're not Jewish or have not spent any significant time around Jewish families, then I suppose some of the film's details might go over your head but only in the same fashion that some specifics of any film based inside of one culture might get lost on people outside of the culture. But the Coen Brothers are pros – and manage to paint these specific 'inside Jewish culture' references with strokes broad enough to be understood thru the idiosyncrasies of any culture.Bottom line: More bizarre genius from the Coen Brothers – but expect to not fully understand the meaning, and in doing so you will completely get the meaning.",A Serious Man

Tightly scripted, with a cohesive group of actors, you can't help but feel a Coens film set is an immensely fun place to be. The whole accident segment was particularly memorable, as was the wife's creepy lover and the dentist's discovery. Here the Coens have created a cosy little world of bumbling ineptitude, feckless mothers, worried fathers, unfathomable rabbis and neighborly misunderstandings and then thrown their own spanners into the ridiculous mix; perfect!Be prepared for the ending, I laughed at the same time as cursing the Coens; twice recently as I'd watched 'Inside Llewyn Davis' earlier in the week.

191,Koma-Mo,"Parts are interesting, but definitely one of the Coen's best.",6,6 September 2019,"As much as I love the Coen Brothers, they do have movies that end up being a miss. Here is a movie that is heavily influenced by the Jewish culture, to the point that I know that the scene was intended to be funny, but I end up being confused and just didn't get it. This film felt like I was sitting in a bar talking to someone who is full of energy and charismatic, but only told in-jokes.The most entertainment that I got was watching Larry, played by Michael Stulbarg, go through a lot of mishaps and unfortunate events. I wondered what will happen to him and if things will work out for him in the end. At the same time though, I do have to admit that the overall plot is rather weak. There is literally something that happens at the beginning of the movie that has no meaning whatsoever. It was interesting to watch, but none of what was shown connected to the whole film. You have a very simple story, but how it was paced and how it went from one scene to another worked at times, but didn't with others.I know the theme revolving around this story, but the pacing was slow at times and there were moments where nothing happened, in which I couldn't help but find myself a little bored. The main character lacks any backbone to stand up, so when you see him get pushed around, it might annoy some people. However, I did like how it ended as it's an ending that only the Coen Brothers can think of.The main standout of the film was Michael Stulbarg as he provided the humor with great reactions and as some may find him annoying, he is able to make the character sympathetic enough to the point that you wish that the guy would catch a break. I did like the rest of the cast and thought they were just fine. They all did what was necessary and were able to provide the humor without any trouble.
No matter if the film is bad, you can always expect the Coen Brothers to give a top quality looking film and this did exactly that. The cinematography is great, along with the way the scene was shot. It is a given and they put a lot of working constructing the shot. With that said, I cannot recommend people to watch this film immediately, unless you are a fan of the Coens.",A Serious Man
192,grandenchilada,I beg to differ,6,25 October 2009,"Immediately after watching this new Coen Bros. film, I went home, dusted off my Bible and looked up the Book of Job. I was trying to understand the point of this frustrating movie. Giving the Coens the benefit of the doubt, I'm guessing it's some sort of modern day biblical parable, and it echoes Job. It's about Larry Gopnik, a Jewish college professor in Minnessota in the late 1960's who gets hit with a relentless series of tribulations that test his decency. He tries looking for answers with the Rabbis in his community, who can't or won't help. The movie starts, amazingly, with a little parable that takes place in a shtetl, in Yiddish. The parable was in itself maddening, about the point of doing good, or of thinking evil; an illustration of moral ambiguity. The scene seems an homage to the days when films and theater thrived in Yiddish, and even more, to the millennial Jewish culture of storytelling, of teaching through narrative. But to judge from what follows, it's hard to understand why it's there. The result is disappointing at almost every level. For one, the Coens have lost sight (ever since O Brother Where Art Thou, it seems) of their funny bone. Their attempts at humor have been leaden (The Ladykillers, Intolerable Cruelty, Burn After Reading, etc.). To misplace your funny bone in a movie about Jews that attempts humor is a particularly terrible sin. The movie is totally missing warmth and mischief, things that made masterpieces of Fargo, Raising Arizona and the Big Lebowski. It has chutzpah, but it feels stifling and stifled. It has no verve. One of the main problems of the film is that Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg, a resourceful actor stuck in a thankless role) is such a total pushover. He has absolutely no edge. The point about Jewish genius nerds (see Woody Allen, Larry David, Seinfeld, etc.) is that they may be nerdy, but they have rapier wit, or deep neurosis or a fantastically funny, warped way of seeing the world. Larry Gopnik has none of this. He is a decent, boring, literal man with endless tolerance for abuse. Thus, he is extremely unlikable. You can't root for a man that doesn't root for himself. I kept thinking of Gene Wilder, who could be as meek as a sheep but had this hilarious undercurrent of hysteria. Something like this would have helped the audience not to lose heart with Larry Gopnik. The Coens have also become intellectually lazy. You can't have an argument with religion, which is what I think this movie is, if you are not going to look sharp. A Serious Man seems made by Jewish atheists duking it out with their religion. Is this a parable of Jewish suffering, of an unduly punishing God? Is it a modern retelling of the Book of Job? Unfortunately, it's hard to tell because the movie refuses to probe deeper into Gopnik's crisis of faith or confidence. I totally identify with the Coens' criticism of rabbis who speak in platitudes about parking lots or who answer everything with unintelligible parables, but what the movie seems to be saying, which is disturbing me, is that the Jewish oral and written tradition is useless in the face of cruelty. By corollary, so is all storytelling. Why bother telling a story if there is nothing to learn, nothing to be done? What is the point of the movie? That you can't go to religion to solve your moral and existential dilemmas? Perhaps organized religion is indeed useless, but the source material is not, just read the awesome Book of Job, probably the first existential text about human despair ever written. It would have been interesting if Larry Gopnik realized he had to help himself and decided to turn things around, whether the outcome was good or bad, funny or tragic. But he just keeps flailing and the world is more and more cruel to him. He keeps claiming he didn't do anything. And that is the problem. I also have a feeling that the Coens, like many modern Jews, are conflicted about their heritage and the ambivalence is palpable. Whatever they are trying to say, it's very confusing. Their portrayal of their Jewish milieu is slightly disturbing. Everybody is a cartoon, and because of this, most characters are unsympathetic. Here, let me bring the example of Larry David, perhaps the most unsympathetic Jewish character that ever walked the Earth. Somebody said to me he is the reason why people hate Jews, that's how polarizing he is. However, Larry David serves a purpose. He is cathartic. He relentlessly explores the fraught relationship of his monstrous inner self with the world at large, and by doing so, he sheds light on all of our interactions, Jewish or not. Onedimensional cartoons in a dramatic film is a different story. Those are actually trickier. There are some tender and inspired moments, as in the relationship of Larry with his crazy brother Arthur (Richard Kind), and intermittent Coen funniness like a Bar Mitzvah boy stoned out of his gourd, and the always deeply gorgeous cinematography of Roger Deakins, but in all A Serious Man feels disturbingly dessicated and aloof, as if the Coens were trying to do a thesis about storytelling and they forgot to connect with their own hearts.",A Serious Man

It's a masterpiece, because if you don't know anything about this movie, you couldn't guess it was made by Coen brothers. It sounds like a Woody Allen's film. But if you think of the subject more closely, it's full of references to all of their other films. Larry Gopnik would have fit perfectly in ""Barton Fink"", ""Miller's crossing"", ""Raising Arizona"" or ""Fargo"". He's a man who have lost everything, but stand still. He's a man whose faith is shaken, but he's still believing. He's still trying to understand what's going on. He may seems beaten, but he is not. This movie has plenty of great scenes.

First off, this whole, abrupt ending and allowing the viewer to decide what happens, is sooooo ""cliche artschool cornball not creative enough to take risk and write an ending so I'm gonna cop out"" move. I mean The Wrestler does that the worse, but this is just as bad. I was literally laughing when the movie ended. The acting is so dismal and the truest sense of try-hard.

195,Samual-M,10/10,10,3 September 2020,"I don't write reviews for older pictures but this film deserves it and it will be short and sweet.The first time I saw A Serious Man, I was naive and turned it off after the first scene. My expectations were thrown off based on other Coen Brothers films but to complete their filmography, I matured and returned to give it another try which was a great choice.If any screenwriter should be given money to indulge in writing a small personal film it's Ethan Coen. This just proves that he's our Ben Hecht. I'm not Jewish but I understood it and found it accessible and as usual, hilarious. The first scene felt like something O. Henry would write and when we get thrown into the actual story, it's writing is comparable to Ernest Hemingway's ""Hills Like White Elephants"" except that Ethan dumbs it down a little which surprisingly isn't enough for people in reviews to get. It could've worked as a silent film or minimal dialogue and would've felt like the adage ""show don't tell"" as Hemingway's story does. The ideas he explores gives him complete freedom to put his characters through hell but with deep meaning. If we don't see ourselves in the film, then as an audience we've failed. I won't pontificate about the purpose but to say by the end of the film you are given an indication of what happens when a character makes a choice & that is when he ties the bow of story neatly, however, there are still lingering questions. I prefer to stay neutral on the meaning as there are two sides that people are taking.This cements his position as my favourite modern screenwriter but more importantly, writer.",A Serious Man
196,tacmovies,The Coens Do Job,8,8 January 2010,"Story: This is the story of Job, set in the 1970's as a bizarre sort of comedy. And, it's really funny. I'm not sure why, as I usually dislike movies where I'm supposed to look feel bad or embarrassed for a genuinely nice fellow like in Meet the Parents or What About Bob, but this one worked for me. Then again, the Coen Bros. Do lots of things that I would probably reject in the hands of some other director (see the epic fail in No Country For Old Men). B Acting: There were lots of great actors, but I have to give a shout out to Simon Helberg who plays Wolowitz on my current favorite sit-com, the Big Bang Theory. I had no idea that he was in this movie until he appeared on screen, and I was like, ""Hey, it's Wolowitz!"" Michael Stuhbarg, Sari Lennick, and Richard Kind all do a great job, but I thought the star actor was Fred Melamed as Sy Ableman. He just plays the nicest, most compassionate douche that just slept with your wife and honestly thinks that you should move out of your own house for the good of your children. A Visuals: This movie was very brown in color, or maybe more of a light tan. Whatever, that color was everywhere. It provided a hazy, should be depressing but oddly light hearted tone to the movie. Well, Mel Brooks always used yellow on the grounds that it was funny color, and it worked. B Sound: The music fit the general era they were trying to establish, even if they say it was supposed to by 1967 but make reference to an album that didn't come out till the 70's. It was fairly quiet, understated movie. B Overall: In many ways, this felt like a live action version of Charlie Brown, in that he never gets to kick the football. Ever. In some small way, I kept thinking of the cartoon Invader Zim while watching this, in that the humor comes through watching horrible things in an exaggerated manner.

198,peter-j-downey,A typical Coen Brothers film,7,25 January 2015,"A Serious Man, by the Coen Brothers, tells the story of a physics lecturer (Michael Stuhlbarg), Larry Goepnik, as each part of his life crumbles around him; making him question everything he once had faith in.Once again Joel and Ethan delve into ancient texts to tell a modern parable about the disconnect between religion and science using the Book of Job as their mirror tale. Each tragedy shows us how Larry is torn between his profession and his heritage. Stuhlbarg's interpretation of this character is the strongest part of this film; little nuances of touching himself and, a definite sense of discomfort throughout made me empathise with Larry in every scene. Even the facial movements of Larry illustrates the strain being placed upon this man.The dialogue in the film could be poetic at times, but there was a constant drive towards narrative, and it left me feeling removed from connecting with anyone but Larry. The scene where Larry is being told by his wife's lover that he has to move out felt comic but cold, and the majority of other scenes kept this tone. And since the plot was a bit episodic, this made the tragedies feel unreal and repetitive.The Coen's direction also felt tired compared to their other films. Typical Coen brother tracking shots, their usual portrait shots, action shots contained to one characters reaction; nothing new. The care and inventiveness that I would usually expect wasn't there. I suppose it being the fourth film from the two in a three year period, they just didn't seem wholly engaged in it. One particular scene where they are tracking a shot down a hall to a crying woman as her crying gets louder, it didn't add any further character development and wasn't interesting but felt like a ""Coen"" shot.Thematically the film was alright, and there are some interesting things that could be analysed, but it was was underwhelming and at times a bit vague in what they were actually trying to say. The ending of the film was indicative of this; 2 interwoven scenes concluding two plots, adding more tragedies to Larry's life but giving nothing to the audience except these tragedies and a feeling of resignation. Being this direct in the treatment of your subject can be dull, and I was left unsatisfied.",A Serious Man

200,jefsof-2,"Channeling David Lynch, In a Good Way",8,6 March 2010,"This is one of my favorite Coen brothers films. A fascinatingly surreal exploration of religious meaning. And their conclusion, as related through their hapless protagonist? None of it means anything. It's all open to interpretation and any meaning is that which we impart.The film opens with a wonderful short film in which a peasant couple argues over whether an old man visitor (invited by the husband) is an evil spirit ghost or not. The wife is convinced, the husband believes his eyes and does not. The wife stabs the old fellow and yet he seems none the worse for wear and marches off - confirming to the wife her belief. The husband notices the blood which oozes from the wound and his face shows doubt.The following main film involves a nerdy science teacher who's life has become the whirlwind. We don't know why this has happened, and he's a generally passive fellow, so he tends to bend in most instances. When he does take a stand (when he resists a bribe), it does him no good. He's henpecked by his wife, bullied by his kids, rides the waves of politics at his job (he's up for tenure), and is wracked by self-doubt and guilt, especially as manifested in his dreams.The milieu of the story is suburban America in the 1960s and our characters are thoroughly Jewish. What is interesting and compelling about A Serious Man is how the Coens have made jewishness seem strange and utterly alien, and their representation of the era seems oppressive and conformist while still stylish and progressive. Menace pervades the film, from almost every character and every situation. There is slow, inexorable build to the film - you are just waiting for something terrible to happen - they way that dirge of dark music will form a foundation in a Lynch film to create a mood.By the end of the film, when a literal whirlwind closes the film and an old, ineffectual man threatens with his incompetence the young children in his charge (fumbling with the keys as the tornado approaches), we are never told why our protagonist reaped the whirlwind and somehow came through it in unexpected ways.My takeaway is that the Coens pretty much despise religion and wanted to illustrate how good people have bad things happen to them, and the officialdom of a given religion and culture (in this case, Judaism) really has nothing of value to offer in explaining the reasons and making it stop, and that ritual can play a role in healing even if it doesn't happen the way intended (the stoned son's successful performance as his Bar Mitzvah). Much of the story focuses on our hero's quest for knowledge from various rabbis, and as he progresses up the chain of prominence he seems to get ever more useless advice. The naive but humble rabbi trainee ends up being the only source of religion that gave him anything worthwhile. The distinguished elder elite rabbi seems a character of menace and physically recalls the old man - possible ghost - from the earlier story in the short film - and he ends up first menacing, then absurd.Terrific performances all around, great tonal control in maintaining the tension of the mood, wonderful visuals, and a thoughtful, well-crafted screenplay on this meditation on religion.By the end of the film you are left wondering what happened and why and it is open to your own interpretation, just like the short film at the beginning.",A Serious Man
201,movieguysla,Job Search,9,23 October 2009,"There is a shot in the opening prologue-scene in A Serious Man where a husband and wife in 19th century Poland, while debating the origin of a visitor to their home, stand next to each other and look through the camera, out into the audience. It is an interesting perspective, as the two of them stand side-to-side and represent polar opposites of a a disagreement. The wife is convinced that their visitor is a ""dybbuk"", a malicious possessing spirit, believed in the Jewish faith to be the dislocated soul of a dead person. The husband is sure the visitor is merely an old man who is need of some warmth and soup. The end of the scene provides no definitive answer to the dispute. The tale is allegorical, meant to show that the mere perception of impending evil can in itself create a kind of curse. Or, perhaps, it shows that Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg), a modern-day descendant of the couple and ""hero"" of A Serious Man, was cursed long ago by a demon. The perspective of the film has been set to be viewed in two disparate ways. The couple stares out at the audience and we are left to choose.The Coen Brothers pick up with Larry and his family in 1967. Larry is a physics professor who is married, with two young children: whiny adolescent daughter Sarah (Jessica McManus) and her younger brother Danny (Aaron Wolff), who is about to celebrate his bar mitzvah, the Jewish ritual of transition to manhood for 13-year-old boys of the faith. From the beginning of our acquaintance with Larry, it's clear that he does not have a solid command of his domain. His wife, Judith (Sari Lennick) has taken up with another man, his son seems only to care whether F-Troop will come in clearly on their television, his neighbor is intimidating, and he is a victim of an attempted bribe by a student who is looking for a better grade. His brother Arthur has come to live with the family in their drab suburban home, and he spends much of his time in the bathroom, draining a persistent sebacious cyst. Judith asks Larry for a divorce.This is Coen Brothers country, and as usual it is populated by ugly, desperate people. Larry attempts to make sense of his world and control it as best he can, but finds himself floundering amid the forces of an oppressive community and the various twists and turns of a dull existence. Larry is dumbfounded by the confluence of negative events that come his way all at once, and is completely incapable of extricating himself from the jaws of the monster that is slowly devouring him and his sense of fairness and nobility. He attempts to seek the advice of several rabbis. He smokes a little weed. He tries to do what's right.The film is an excruciating discovery of the helplessness of a man who simply is not equipped to surmount his many perils. Larry Gopnik is the anti-Odysseus, as he stays in one place and repeatedly fails God's trials, never finding his way to the home he imagines with a loving wife and children. With fairness. With hope. With triumph.The Coen Brothers have crafted another eviscerating examination of humanity, this time via the prism of the Jewish religion and community. It's not hard to imagine that they themselves likely grew up in a similar world as the one the viewer sees on the screen. Or, perhaps, it is merely their perception that makes the world look as stark and bleak as it is for the fictional Larry Gopnik. Either way, if the view and presentation of the Coen Brothers can be trustedand perhaps they have earned that by now then their unflinching willingness to show Jewish stereotypes that they are clearly well-acquainted with is in itself shocking.The most gorgeously grotesque scene in the film takes place at young Danny's Bar Mitzvah ceremony. He has gotten high in the bathroom with his buddies and must then walk to the stage, stand at the bema (altar), and perform his end of the ritual davening (singing prayer) for all the members of the congregation. As riveting and convoluted as any scene the Coen Brothers have ever crafted, this scene allows the audience to see through the eyes of a freaked-out young man as he peers at all the attendees in the Temple. Some are bored. Some are happy. Some are scared. They all are the denizens of Danny's fears and nightmares. There is levity, terror, ugliness. There is comedy.Near the end of the film, Larry's brother Arthur (the sublime Richard Kind) tells Larry that Larry has received great gifts from God, while Arthur has received no such gifts for himself. From Arthur's point-of-view, that may be true. From the audience's point-of-view, things don't look great for either of them. Larry is perhaps even worse off than Arthur (who is also having legal trouble stemming from his sexual appetites), but Larry seems utterly incapable of turning his ship away from the coming storm. He is too afraid of changing course. This fear has festered and enveloped him, and by the end of the film, Larry has no choice. No way out. He is ultimately a victim of the defenses that he and his community have erected. He is his own hostage.If you know the work of the Coen Brothers, you know none of these themes represent new ground for them. But in what is perhaps their most introspective and controversial film to date, they have afforded us all a unique perspective. Go to the doctor. Kiss your children. Receive tenure. Keep your chin up. Life is beautiful.",A Serious Man
202,peterm1,Nice guys finish last.,8,23 December 2016,"It kind of cracks me up when I read people saying they do not understand this movie and that makes it a bad movie. (People today love simplistic answers - even if they are wrong. It is much more reassuring that having to think). In this case at least isn't this the point though? Life IS like that. The core of the movie seems to be about the inscrutability of the universe and of God's purpose. Or is there a God? It does not ask this question outright - but it is hanging there. Together with the question we all have - we are convinced there must be an answer to - what is OUR purpose? Poor old Larry Gubnik, always being a serious man. Always doing what's right and in return being served up a big steaming pile of drek. Seeking answers from God (or the Rabbi) and getting nonsense - or getting no answer at all. Very dark. But I have been there myself at times in my life when all of my plans have been crapped upon by the universe - trying the same things Larry tried, asking the same questions Larry asked but - Silence. So I get it. I get what Larry is going through. And of course some reviewers have pointed out the similarities to the biblical story of Job. But did anyone else pick up the symbolism in the movie of Larry, up on the roof, twisting the TV antenna to get a better reception - a message from the ether? When this is also exactly the theme of the movie. Poor old Larry cannot even get ""F Troop"" clearly. How can he expect to get a clear message from God. This was not a coincidence, folks. Those sneeky Coen brothers!The movie also raises issues many Jews specifically have had to ask themselves in the face of say, writ large, the holocaust. Jews confronted by outright malice and evil or by just by being in the wrong place at the wrong time ask themselves that eternal question. If there is a God, why does he let bad things happen. For some this was the trigger to turn off religion. For others it strengthened their faith somehow. So at another level the movie is about what is it about to be a Jew and to ask yourself the same questions that Jews have asked themselves down the ages. In this case ""What's going on?"" as the Coen's express it.Also I have a sneeky feeling this movie is also biographical in a way. The Coens grew up in the twin cities area of USA in the 1960s I have read. They would have been Bar Mitvah'd in a synagogue much like the one depicted and the Jewish characters would have been much like those depicted too. The life questions they may have asked themselves as they became adults would have been much like those asked in the movie and even if all the bad stuff did not happen to them personally they may well have feared it would - will I get an urgent call from my doctor about a routine xray? Will my kid's Bar Mitzvah go OK. Will my wife run off with another man, taking everything I have including my family, self respect and my understanding of who I am? In other words perhaps all the normal stuff of life. But written in bold type both because us Jews are a neurotic bunch and because it is damn good material for black comedy. As Woody Allen found out before them.But of course the Coens would not have gotten any answers to these questions just as Larry did not. Silence. Zip. Bupkis. But there is one thing I learned that life taught me and maybe this is part of the message too. Nice guys too often DO finish last. If you are too nice, too compliant, too good, people will take advantage and crap on you. And maybe the universe does too, although in its case, not because it is malicious, but rather, just uncaring. And that is a lesson poor old Larry never learned.",A Serious Man
203,pforrest-2,An absolutely wonderful movie!,10,27 June 2011,"Fantastic entertainment, but much more than that. Wonderful acting by a generally not A-list cast; superb directing, perfect cutting, witty script, great camera-work and lighting. This is seriously one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It looks at the ridiculousness of religion with love and warmth. Brilliant. If the Coen brothers had made no other movie they would have fulfilled their destiny with this one. I thought Fargo was wonderful, but this is even better. It is seriously almost faultless. Impossible to pick out that stars in this, except to say that everyone involved should be totally proud of their achievement. Great film-making.",A Serious Man
204,fleetmind,Faithful or Faithless - you will like this (Some spoilers),9,15 November 2009,"Okay - saw A Serious Man tonight and loved it. The Coens do it again. The best thing about this movie? It's ambiguity! Sure, it's the story of Job...there are some serious pointers towards faith in this movie...but on the other hand (what a Jewish thing to say) it's ambiguity supports the atheistic side of things as well. I love movies with this interesting dichotomy.I am a goyish atheist married to a Jewish atheist. Nevertheless, we both thoroughly enjoyed this film. On the superficial level, there is much to enjoy in the portrayal of Jewish suburban culture. But deeper than that go the questions of goodness and justice that we all face - the faithful and the unfaithful. For instance, I was absolutely wincing near the end when Larry changed the grade - simply because I happen to believe in rightness, justice and doing the right thing REGARDLESS of whether you have bad x-rays or a tornado hanging over your head.In other words, I believe in goodness independent of God - as I expect most decent humans do. NO GOOD ever comes of taking the evil fork in the road - although I must say that that other wonderful Jewish filmmaker - Woody Allen - gave us a different outcome in his brilliant film Crimes and Misdemeanors.But back to the Coens. All this is why they have given us such a great film - the ambiguity, the questions of life, and the simple humanness of it all. Not to mention the knockout performances by everyone in the cast. Everyone old and young was super - but ol' Adam Arkin - what a nice turn!",A Serious Man
205,dominicpearson,Not a Cohen Brothers classic,7,6 August 2011,"But still an example of their skills as directors and story tellers. It is well worth watching but will not be everyones cup of tea. This film is not as accessible as, say, Burn After Reading or Big Lebowski but neither is it as off the wall strange as Barton Fink and Fargo.What we have here is a very personal film with clear autobiographical tendencies. The film is well written, well directed and well acted. It just lacks a certain something at its heart.The film centres around Larry Gopnik and the unravelling of his life. He considers himself to be the titular Serious Man, works hard and follows his faith as best he can. Unfortunately for him those around him seem destined to bring him down; there is the wife who wants to leave him (and who ultimately expects him to pay for her new mans funeral!), there is the pot head son and snooty daughter. There is bribery, blackmail and all kinds of temptation thrown across Larry's path all flooding in at the same difficult time in his life. Think American Beauty but without the midlife crisis coming out.This life is turned upside down and develops as a tragi-comedy of sorts. The film is very funny in places but you cant help but feel for Larry as everything falls to pieces. At the same time, however, you get the feeling that if he developed a bit of a backbone these events wouldn't keep on happening. The Cohen Brothers have, therefore, developed a very realistic and flawed character that you feel for but ultimately you can stand back and laugh at (rather than with) as his hardships are his own doing.I have watched this film twice in order to make my mind up about it. What I like is the performance of Michael Stuhlbarg. I have no recollection of seeing him in anything else so was able to immerse myself entirely in his performance. The subtlety with which he pulls of the character is a testament. The performance can only work if the actor is able to convey the feelings of frustration and anger and the requirement that these be bottled up. You know that the rage is bubbling inside but it is not evident outwardly in any way. Suck it up, move one and take the next punch. And Stuhlbard does this with aplomb. The central performance could easily have left you feeling no sympathy for the character, only anger at his inability to sort himself out. That you do not shows that the actor has earned his pay cheque.The film is directed and shot as well as you would expect from a Cohen Brothers film. It is a much more lean film than, say, No Country and this is to its benefit. There is none of the meandering shots and slow pacing that (for me) hindered No Country. Having said that, it is not the most amazing looking of films but it is not that type of production.The supporting cast are, unfortunately, forgettable. This and the lack of knowledge about everything Jewishness (which is at the heart of the film) dampened my appreciation of the film which had been built up with the performance of Stuhlbard. Sadly, as well, I was not impressed with the now standard Cohen ending of cutting half way through a scene with no conclusion. They have used this 3 times in as many films and it is getting boring now. Guys - you are legendary directors, use a new trick.They will be judged on the basis of their classics, of which there are many, but this will sit towards the back of their collection for most. It feels, ultimately, that it is a vanity piece. Something very personal to the brothers, so much so that they probably care not for mine or anyone elses opinions on it!",A Serious Man

I would say the cinematography is very good and had a nice experience watching it but what sours the overall experience is the movie feels very much incomplete and doesn't lead up-to the expectations.There should be more story to it and it doesn't answers many questions and doesn't gives an proper ending.I would not recommend the movie to anyone.,A Serious Man

I'm unsure it's necessary. If a person hates this movies, said person may have valid reasons. A person over 25 has maybe one or two possible reasons This is a very smart movie, that also happens to be very funny. Will Jews laugh more? All other things being equal, yes. A lot more? No. Everyone knows the main characters, Jews might have spent more time, close time, with the main characters. The fact is people expect a whodoneit. They want answers and closure and nothing could be less important as far as this movie is concerned. This is life. Life has no closure. Experience is factored in and the person moves on.

208,dwolf77,It Makes You Think,10,1 September 2018,"A Serious Man is one of the Coen brothers' best films. It is centered on a middle aged Jewish physics professor (Larry Gopnik), one that unfortunately begins to see his life fall apart at the seems. The filmmaking on display here is superb. The writing and directing at the helm of the Coen brothers is perfect. The two capture the truly depressing story of Larry Gopnik, yet also make the entire film hilarious. The camera work by the always fantastic Roger Deakins is just as great as usual, and the lack of music adds to the bleak world these characters live in. The preformance by Michael Stuhlbarg on display can't be overstated. Stuhlbarg doesn't play a melancholy, depressed shmuck, nor does he play a blind and ignorant fool. Stuhlbarg manages to find a perfect middle ground for his preformance; he is just a man trying to find answers to why his life is falling apart. As he searches for the answer from various different rabbis it just seems to continue to evade him. He constantly asks ""Why?"" all of these bad things are happening to him, and maybe the answer is as simple as, there is no reason. As the Book of Job so elegantly puts it, even decent men are often subject to suffering. The film provides a fair criticism of religion, in this case Judaism, as often being unhelpful with real life problems. The end of the film is hard to interpret, probably done on purpose by the filmmakers. As Professor Gopnik recieves a harrowing call about a recent x-ray taken at the doctor's office, a tornado simultaneously approaches Danny's (Gopnik's son) school, and all hope seems to be lost. This could be viewed as an apocalyptic related ending, tying into one of the major themes of the film, religion. All in all, I would consider this film perfect. Every aspect of the entire movie is done superbly, and it leaves you with a lot to think about. It truly is a must-see film.",A Serious Man

So all the art lovers will say,'oh your not clever enough to understand' I will retort with'we are not daft enough to fall for this rubbish' I feel that the Coen bros are insulting our intelligence,they must sit back and say'we don't even have to try''some nutter will give it a great review and look for something that is not there'.

There were many laugh-out-loud moments, great use of music (the Coens are just so damn good at this), and one of the best performances of 2009 from Michael Stuhlbarg in a year filled with great performances by Christoph Waltz, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Clooney, Sam Rockwell and many others. And while I'm usually not too thrilled with ""You-decide-what-happens"" endings (I'm here to be told a story, so tell me the WHOLE story if you please!), this one didn't bother me quite as much, probably because the movie is so quirky anyway.

211,ildimo1877,Consistently brilliant!,9,31 August 2010,"There's a moment in the beginning, when Mr. Michael Stuhlbarg says to a persistent Asian student of his, that math are the means to understand his physics and he uses a fable to illustrate. A Serious Man, the consistently brilliant outing by the currently most in shape American directors, is exactly that. And they also use a fable to illustrate.You simply have got to know the Coen universe to understand this film, a film about physics, chance and occurring improbability in an outrageously godless world.On the surface, Judaism offers the clear cut answers – the dybbuk prelude is a script device in a class of its own, with no other predecessor but the Sam Elliott character in the Big Lebowski – mother nature denies to ascertain. In its name, all religion is called down. Humorously detached, cynically observant, bitterly pessimistic, the latest Coen input is a glorious masterpiece of understating the horror of human bondage and their greatest film since that life-altering Dude of mythopoeic America.",A Serious Man
212,Locut0s,A seriously good film.,9,3 May 2010,"Don't let those who tell you this is a comedy fool you. Not the the film won't make you laugh, in fact there is plenty of humour to be found here (and it's typical Cohen brothers humour at that), but at it's heart this is a black and disturbing work of art.Meet Lawrence Gopnik. A physics professor about to get his tenure. He lives your typical 1960s suburban family life. A rancher home, a wife, 2 kids, a car. The American dream come true. But from the very start there's the creeping suspicion that there's something rotten at the core here. Through the course of the film we learn that Larry's wife is planning to divorce him for a man that can only be described as emotionally false and insincere in the worst way possible. He is being blackmailed by a student who wished to have his failing grade changed. He has a racist neighbour with whom he is having a property dispute with. He totals his car. His wife and children are stealing money from him. His brother who has moved in with him turns out to have a gambling addiction and is charged with soliciting a male prostitute. Basically anything that can go wrong does go wrong. And through all of this Larry tries in vain to understand ""why me"", ""for what reason are these things happening to me""? He seeks help from a series of more and more ineffectual and downright uncaring Rabbis. Who give him the typical self help pablum, only packaged in humour only the Coen brothers could come up with. Of course the answer is right in front of Larry the whole time. There is no answer. There is no reason these things happen, it's not fair, it's just life. Larry is a man seeking answers yet the very subject he teaches, quantum mechanics, tells one that answers are fleeting. That the truth lies in how one observes the problem. Is the cat alive, or dead? There is a point at the end where we feel that everything is going to work out in the end, but at the very last second things take a turn for the worst. One can see this perhaps as punishment for a decision Larry makes (up till this point life simply happened to him only at this critical juncture does he make a mistake of his own) or perhaps it's all part of the same uncertainty. Life is a cruel joke and in the end we die. The palpable sense of foreboding and ""wrongness"" throughout the film comes to a head right at the end and is physically manifest in a particularly wonderful and disturbing way. One can not escape the injustices of life and in the end death claims us all.",A Serious Man
213,aschein81,A serious look at human nature!,9,17 October 2009,"I just saw this film earlier today and I have to say that it was simply thrilling. Now how can I possible say that it was thrilling when there were zero action scenes, zero suspense, and zero plot? To me, it's exactly because it lacks those things that makes this film thrilling! If you are reading through these IMDb reviews, you already know the general premise of the movie and have likely seen the preview, and so knowing that it is a Coen brothers movie you probably know what kind of film to expect. One of the things I really love about this film (which others may hate) is because it basically has no plot, and is simply 90 minutes of one middle-aged man's struggles in life, with no type of resolution whatsoever. The tone and slow pacing of the film reminded me a great deal of the film ""Sideways(2004)"" in that we just see an average guy's struggles with the people in his life, with some comedic moments thrown in occasionally to break the overall depressing mood of the film. Like that film, you are so able to relate to the main character and his problems because his issues and the people he has issues with are so genuine.And that's exactly why I call this review ""a serious look at human nature."" All of the great satire is in fact based closely on reality, or realistic events that we can relate to. In this film, the main character's issues are so average and normal (divorce, teenage son experimenting with pot, possible job advancement/work stability, etc.) that they are parts of almost everyone's everyday life. Even the interactions and subplots with the Asian student and the hunting neighbors are so very realistic, which aids in making them hilarious. Even if you are not Jewish, you will still be able to relate to and understand the satire in this film. Some moviegoers with short attention spans will probably hate this film and wonder when the big, explosive fight scene will be or when the Adam Sandler/Will Ferrell stupid fart/gay jokes will start appearing...but of course this film is the exact opposite of typical Hollywood.Another reason why I am giving this film such a high score is because while watching this film it is clear just how much the Coen brothers simply LOVE making films, and they are only concerned with making the film their way. They don't care about box office profits or a target demographic...they just make films that are personal to them. It's just so refreshing to see. Just look at the attention to detail they will put into one scene of dialogue between characters. Look at the way the glasses' on someone's face are angled, the way the characters' hair is just a tiny bit messy, the way a character holds his yamaka in place while running, the way the lines are set-up and timed perfectly to have the perfect effect on the audience. When you watch this you can just see how dedicated they are to their craft. These guys care so much about creating little details and endearing characters and so little about any kind of recycled plot. Hats off to the Coen boys once again! Shalom!",A Serious Man
214,ILoveASeriousMan,A Constantly Rewarding Coen Masterpiece,10,30 March 2010,"First off this is a love or hate it movie. Want Optimism? Action? Dick-Jokes? Plot? Happy Ending? All the answers given? Don't Waste your time For me and some others (and certainly not enough as I'd like) This film is Brilliant. A Masterpiece. The Coen Brothers Best. It's about the meaning of life, it's about the big things 'What it's all about' and the little things that fill it up like Marijuana and teeth.It has offered me new rewards on repeated viewings. I saw it three times at the cinema and liked it more each time. So multi-layered is this film, it takes me a long time before I can watch something else.Every scene contains the duality. The money problems. The dynamic between Larry and his son along with Larry and his wife, is balanced with the two neighbors.The film can be viewed from a religious perspective and an atheist one as to why things are the way they are. Oh, how like the world we live in. I think the Coen Brothers aren't just testing Larry they're testing the audience. If you can't accept the mystery (we never find out if Larry or his son will die) then you might find yourself unable to escape your problems. If it depresses you and you can't just laugh it off, change.Michael Stuhlbarg (who is OUTSTADNING) plays a modern Job, or just another human being (remember my perspective comment?) He remains admirably optimistic and warm but we shake our heads at him, for not doing anything.Sy Ableman the man who takes Larries wife, might be the devil. Larry does not stand up to him so the devil takes over. And god might be the one who strikes Sy down for sinning, or it just happened without any religious meaning because religions a lie....talk about perspective. Sy is in Dynamic with the Dybbuk at the beginning way back when in Poland and the curse does/does not get put upon a simple couple and may have gone on all the Jews, Sy Ablemans dead body wasn't watched over when he dies so Larries dreams are haunted. My older brother said a Jewish mans curse is his wife. The wife stabs the Dybbuk and Larries wife pushes him to the rabbis that give the carefully watching audience perspective and Larry none. Larry can't see the joy in the parking lot. Larry wants the answer to what happened to the Goy. Larry can't see that Marshak wants him to figure it himself.....I'm always asking myself if another film has ever made me think this way...no it hasn't.And the ending once again. The phone call Larry gets about his health right after making the choice on the grade, the same action happens before his wife decides to divorce him. And his son Danny begins with trying to deal with the money problem, the radio is taken, the journey starts, it ends with him trying to deal with it but realizes it does not matter, he'll probably die. And if he keeps living or dies no answer will be given, so the answer to Larry and his sons fate has no purpose. No answer will be their, so we need to laugh and enjoy the journey instead of focusing on the end.This film finally has crashed my top 20 movies taking it's place at Number One (Seriously). It ends where it begins and I could talk about it all day, of all the intertwining layers that this film has and we should be grateful exists, like all good things. That includes the parking lot.",A Serious Man
215,editor-131,'Serious' film-osophical folly & a fillip of physics,9,22 December 2009,"Kathleen Falsani has written The Dude Abides: The Gospel According to the Coen Brothers. In an interview with her on National Public Radio on Dec. 20, Falsani explained the ""moral order"" she finds explored in the dozen and a half films of these sibling auteurs. Well, I've been exploring that theme in their films for years. In fact, who can watch ""Raising Arizona"" or ""The Big Lebowski"" or ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" and not recognize that the Coens are preoccupied by the way in which people bumblingly travel—or fall off (or off and on)—a righteous path. (The very title ""Raising Arizona"" invokes the phrase ""raising hell""—not in the sense of partying, but in the sense of committing mayhem—and by so doing, calling up the forces of the underworld—with which H.I. and Edwina and others have to contend as they try to protect the newborn they've kidnapped.) The Coens' current film ""A Serious Man"" is as illustrative of their explorations of this theme as any, and that, as well as its fine acting, period verisimilitude and amusement factor leave it ranking with their best. The film opens with a scene that seems unrelated to the rest of the film, where a man's wife in Jewish Eastern Europe decades ago kills her husband's benefactor, thinking he's a ""dybbuk""—a demon. But the astute viewer may realize the scene tips us off to the idea that our encounters with our fellow human beings are often fraught with moral dilemmas of serious import. Whether it's college math professor's Larry Gopnick's deciding what to do about his Korean student who leaves a bribe in his quest for a better grade (so he won't lose his student visa), or paralyzed in what to do about his free-loading, layabout brother (Richard Kind)—the question arises: What's best to do, and should one worry about the consequences—both in the here-and-now, and also possibly a hereafter—or try to do what's just right, per abstract principle? Into this question the Coens again throw the possible red herring of modern quantum physics, as they did more perfunctorily in ""The Man Who Wasn't There."" Here though, a blackboard full of the mathematical proof of what can't be known—Heisenberg ""uncertainty""—is paralleled by Gopnick's brother's psychotic-seeming notebook containing his occult ""Mentaculum""—a Kabbalistic-looking bunch of scrawlings offering a certainty that apparently guides him in his successful gambling ventures. The film plays a few visual tricks on viewers, but even they invoke some of the arcane notions of contemporary physics. Just when you think one driver is about to be harmed in a car accident, it's actually his counterpart (the unctuous friend who's having an affair with Larry's wife) who dies in a similar, simultaneous crash. (Thereby invoking current theories about certain paired subatomic particles separated by time and space, where what happens to one mysteriously affects the other.) As if the ""Perplexed"" of Maimonides' title, Gopnick seeks advice from his synagogue's senior rabbi as personal, professional and financial travails increasingly weigh on him. Unfortunately the rabbi doesn't do much pastoral work any more, so Gopnick (played with a perfect, barely suppressed, passive desperation by Michael Stuhlbarg) is first counseled by two associate rabbis—whose ""help"" is of questionable value. (The second rabbi is played unerringly by George Wyner, the former assistant D.A. ""Irwin Bernstein"" of ""Hill Street Blues"" fame.) Speaking of rabbis, Kabbala, Maimonides—this film is, as ""The Daily Show's"" Jon Stewart would say, undeniably ""Jewy."" But that's inessential; with a few tweaks you could pose all the same questions and themes in any other cultural milieu. Jewish suburban life in the Midwest in the '60s does lend itself well to the themes, however, and the setting is apparently closely autobiographical for the Coens—so, it's what they know. The film ends in a way similar to the Coens' recent Oscar-winner, ""No Country for Old Men""—abruptly, unsettlingly and without resolution. Which, given the ultimately unknowable answers to the questions it poses, is thoroughly appropriate.",A Serious Man

The Coens give us such classics as ""Fargo"" and their most recent ""True Grit"", and they hit solid home runs. The problem with these Coen boys is, most of their films have grounded out in my opinion, and this one is no exception. They have stated repeatedly they make films they want to see. Well, they can keep this one.My biggest pet peeve in movies is when a film has a beginning and a middle and an ending, without actually GIVING us an ending.

I couldn't have said it better myself. The opening scene had no purpose, point, sense, belonging or reason. It was perfect, because it completely foreshadowed and defined the next 100 minutes.The film gets a ""2"" for the ONE funny scene that made me laugh, but it's so late in the film that I don't even want to subject you to sitting through the first hour-plus to get to it.",A Serious Man

A great story will take you on a journey through different worlds and will cause you to commit emotionally to it. I appreciate great acting, great direction, great cinematography, and great special effects. Some movie fans appreciate those technical aspects even more so than I because they are what make a movie ""art"". They can enjoy a movie merely because of superb performances of its cast regardless of the story. But, for me, I cannot call a movie ""great"" unless it tells a great story.""A Serious Man"" had some great acting. It did transport me to a different world. For a short while I lived as a middle class Jewish man in the 1970's. Those are the only good things I have to say about the movie. For me ""A Serious Man"" was a waste of time. The description on Netflix said, ""His wife wants out. His son's a pothead. His rabbi can't help him. Poor schlub. He could do worse, but not by much."" That is exactly what happens in the movie. That and nothing else. This is one of those movies where stuff happens to characters in the movie, but nothing gets resolved. Nothing is finalized. Nothing is settled. Nothing is explained. I said earlier I did feel like I was a middle class Jewish man in the 1970's. That is only because the movie makers did a good job of re-creating that world with cars, costumes, music, and props of the era. However, I would prefer reading about this era and lifestyle from an encyclopedia versus spending 115 minutes watching this movie. An encyclopedia article would have as much closure as this storyline does, it would take only a fraction of the time, and it would be equally as enjoyable. I was left so unfulfilled and dissatisfied by the movie that I had to look it up to find more about it. Who made this piece of garbage? Did it go direct to DVD? Was it a college art student's project film? That's when I found out it was written by the Cohen brothers, and it was nominated for best original screenplay and best picture. It's pretty clear the only people that like this movie are the art snobs, exactly the kind of people at the Academy.

One of his students tries to bribe him into giving him a passing grade and when Larry refuses, threatens a lawsuit. His troglodyte neighbor bullies him. His teenage children, being teenage children, can see his predicament and yet are too wrapped up in their own petty concerns to give him the affection and companionship he needs. In desperation, Larry seeks out, in succession, the advise of three Rabbais who, like the friends of Job in the Bible, offer nothing. (Although I suspect that the old Rabbi, Marshak, refuses to see Larry not because he is too busy 'thinking' but because he perceives the state of Larry's soul and understands that aloneness is necessary to his ultimate triumph. Viewed this way, his refusal is a gesture of respect.) Instead of retaliating, Larry simply absorbs the insults and cruelty. When his wife and her lover suggest he move out of his own house to a seedy motel, he quietly complies. He carries on with each situation by ascertaining the most civil, the most considerate response until, at the end of the film, things turn around and each burden resolves to a tolerably good conclusion (the most satisfying of which is the sudden death of his wife's lover), seemingly by itself. Mysteriously, God laid these burdens on Larry and, just as mysteriously, He lifted them. It was all for a purpose. The burdens could have been born with such grace only by a serious man. The trial is over.",A Serious Man
219,afredlee,This movie don't make any sense,4,8 December 2010,"This is one of those times where my preference don't agree with IMDb ratings. I don't really understand this movie. What I don't understand most of all is why the main character be so pathetic. Being ignored by his kids, bullied by his wife, even tolerate his wife's being condescending to him. It is a dark comedy after all. I'm not familiar with Jewish tradition, maybe that's why its hard to relate to many aspect of this movie.First of all, I feel the interaction between the characters feel very distant. The dad don't seemed to have control over his kids. The kids just seemed so apathy about tragedy and unconcern about anything else other than themselves. The wife is occupied with her own thing. Even the rabbis are not able to relate to the guy's pain. Maybe that's the joke.I do enjoy the cinematography of this movie though. Its beautifully shot, especially the barmitvah ceremony. The short scene at the lake is also beautiful. That's the only scene that I like..The ending was also disappointing to me. After watching what feel like a chore for me, this movie doesn't even wrap up properly. I don't know how to feel about this movie. It just seemed strange and doesn't make much sense.

220,proteus6847,A Frivolous Film,3,16 January 2012,"Until the last few minutes of this movie, its hero Larry Gopnik is both (a) a perfectly good man, and (b) a spineless worm who lets the world walk over him. Neither trait is humanly credible. Consequently, the movie is too divorced from reality to have much meaning, even as a comedy. And since spinelessness is hardly admirable, one cannot say that Larry is an attractive or sympathetic figure.The movie is also plagued by elements that remain--how to put it?--unassimilated. Take its curious prologue, which is a parable about moral ambiguity. Someone who appears to be a revered elder and a good samaritan may actually be a demon in disguise--or maybe not; it's hard to tell. But the film itself is about a latter-day Job who suffers the insults, afflictions and outrages of the world: an unambiguously good man to whom unambiguously bad things happen. In short, the prologue has nothing to do with the movie. It's merely the Coen brothers indulging themselves to no purpose, and not for the first time.The same is true of Rabbi Marshak quoting Grace Slick. Yes, it's a send-up of a false sage. But it's also shallow Boomer populism, telling us, with a collusive wink, that we can get as much wisdom from trippy rock songs as from the learning of the ages. I don't find that to be credible either.",A Serious Man

Admitedly i was intrigued enough to watch it to the end. I was furiously annoyed with the ending and wished I hadn't wasted nearly 2 hours watching this ""film"" hence posting my review.The acting isn't bad but seems one dimensional and there doesn't appear to be any depth of characters. You keep expecting the main character to go ""postal"" but does nothing of the sort.As for being a Black Comedy I have watched many films of this genre and it barely made me give a wry smile at times. The true comedy is the Coen Brothers making a film that I watched to the end only to wish I hadn't bothered.Knowing about the Jewish faith would probably improve your understanding of this film, however the only message an ""Atheist"" like my self can obtain is that if you are done wrong repeatedly that is doesn't make it OK to do something that is ""unethical"".To sum up: Only worth watching if you are either religious or have nothing better to do for 2 hours of your life!",A Serious Man

In my opinion, A Serious Man is quite simply a philosophical masterpiece. However, it seems to have passed through the cinema quite quietly and remains almost a well-kept secret.At the end of my first viewing I have to confess that I was left rather stunned. What is this film? What the hell's going on? What have the Coen brothers done to me? Where's George Clooney? Where's Frances McDormand?? In fact, I can totally see how the film has received so many (very) low scores. However, this is one of those films that needs a day or two to float around in your mind. Think about it. What happens? Why does it happen? The more you think about the story, the more it slowly sinks into your subconscious. I've seen it four times now and it gets better & better with each viewing. Almost every time I hear somebody say ""but that's not fair"", I am instantly reminded of A Serious Man.

That this film would appeal to anyone who was under 50 and not Jewish is downright unbelievable to me.

What an utter disappointment. I can only imagine that it was intended as a spoof or that it has tons of inside humor and meaning for the Jewish audience. If you watch the Coens snickering in the background during filming as caught in the ""making of"" special included on the DVD it only lends credence to the practical joke theory. One positive thing that it did accomplish was a vivid demonstration of the lack of benefits to be derived from organized religion when one is truly in an emotional crisis. If that was the Coen's intent; i.e., to discredit and denigrate their religion, they succeeded. Henceforth, I will be doing more research before spending money to see new Coen brothers movies.

He is the glue for his dysfunctional Jewish family. He tries to do right for his family, for his religion, but no one else in his family and in his life is upholding their end of being a good Jew. No one else is living by Jewish law or any other law. The setting is Minnesota Jefferson Airplane time frame. The cinematography was superb. The little nuances in the manner of speech was perfect with the facial expressions of everyone during each scene was so right on. I haven't seen a movie quite like this in a very long time where everything clicks, body language, background music, dialogue, lighting and make-up/costuming.

Both of them said this one was different. Both of them were wrong. This is a truly awful film, full of unsympathetic and unbelievable characters with no worthwhile plot and an ending that ranks alongside 'The Italian Job' for being an arrogant, audience insulting cop out.

229,hendersonhall,very disappointing,2,9 February 2010,"Some of the notices here suggest that if you're Jewish you'll get a lot more out of this flick than if you're not. News flash: I'm a Jew and I thought this was one of the Coen Brothers' worst efforts. They're better doing Irish (Miller's Crossing) than Jewish. OK, it's the Book of Job minus the interesting theological arguments (which is a huge minus). Yes, I get the Schroedinger's Cat theory (about quantum physics and it's unexplained), but it's poor physics and Einstein among others debunked it. The title character's admission that he doesn't understanding the story is damning--and unfortunately not pursued. (His Korean student and that student's father understand it perfectly.) To put the story briefly, at the risk of doing it an injustice, it posits that everything in life is uncertainty until you do something, like observing it, that makes it certain--which alters it. A cat in a box may be alive or dead, but opening the box (according to the theory, if I understand it correctly) alters things by making it certain. No, as Einstein said (not in so many words), it doesn't alter the fact of the cat being alive or dead, it alters our perception from uncertainty to knowledge. OK, uncertainty pervades the life of our serious (and uninteresting) title character, who could also be called A Mediocre Man--just as uncertainty is what we are left with after the apt prologue. But so what? He's just dim. And the serious rabbis who talk to him in religious catch phrases and parables (like the cute but not apt dentist story) are just as dim. The Coens should have employed Bill Maher to help on a rewrite. They've done superior work before (starting with their first, Blood Simple, and including No Country for old Men), but they've done tedious piffle as well, including this one. I'm willing to put up with stuff like this while waiting for the superior stuff, but I'm unwilling to praise it just because they made it.",A Serious Man

232,vortex007,I live at the Jolly Roger,10,27 February 2010,"Another screen depicted by Coen brothers portrays their perfectly balanced and traditional noir vein. On this occasion they put the spectators into tangled cobwebs of the Jewish community and complicated private life of Larry Gopnik who feels ''a serious crisis'' on his own back. Plugged into the hilarious and grubby style Coen set the tone of disorderly Homeric laughing. No it's not a hysterical laugh Coen are never ignite the viewers but if u seen Big Lebowski or Burn After Reading you'll understand what's their secret.A Serious Man is more perplexing and knotty than other Coen's movies and so for those who never seen Coen's movies, such sequence in the action and the punch line may be literally confused and deluded. Therefore A Serious Man not the best movie to begin acquaintance with Coen's art because they rapidly growing in incoherent behavior, training fans for a years. Hence it's time to present a picture for serious people, serious in the proper sense of this word. Yes, it's not a joke; you need to be seriously serious to watch this distillation of emphatic, subtle, sloppy and inane sarcasm. You'll probably ask me: ''Be serious to be able to laugh? Hey man whatta hell are u talking about?!'' Here's the answer, laugh isn't enough to be pleased by A Serious Man, you may laugh for all the time, but if you don't understand such vein of directing you won't enjoy it, moreover this movie will be boring for you.It's a sort of sarcastic philosophy, questions without answers. Wonderfully expressed world's refinement of cruelty constantly putting you into a dilemma, whether you want to be like Larry Gopnik honest, kindhearted but weak or like other characters here strong but slippery, showing to everybody spurious respect? That's rhetorical question isn't it? Probably you don't want to take up both attitudes but how to be honest and strong? That's a question that left without any answer here; here we just provided by opposite kinds of personality nothing more, Coen do not trying to influence on spectators, they suggest to make our own conclusions and decisions. ''Watch & decide'' is a latent motto here.Regarding to the Jews community, well I can't say anything about it because I'm not a Jew and I never lived in theirs communities. Probably it contains something that I didn't notice due to the cultural and mentality differences. However I find it as light banter, not offending, Coen cannot make movie to insult Jews because actually their parents were Jews. And I suppose Jews community taken here because of bible popularity, A Serious Man basically presents some kind of non-restrictive modern bible universe.So this time Coen brothers put extra efforts, took all advantages of their previous works and made masterful work.

(""No Country..."" was more Cormac McCarthy than Coen, and ""Burn After Reading"" was fun but finally empty.) Revisiting the Jewish Midwest of their adolescence and examining their identity, even with tongue in cheek, has resulted in a film that's poetic and thoughtful as well as hilarious. The Job-inspired story goes continually over the top, the characters are spot-on caricatures, and the script and cinematography are continuously clever, surprising and delightful. Michael Stuhlbarg is wonderful as the protagonist, a slighter, less assertive Albert Brooks, his face a constant barometer of the chaos and suffering he's subjected to. The ending comes unexpectedly but in retrospect it's just right. There's obviously a lot here that Jewish viewers will get and appreciate more than non-Jews, but the period detail (despite a few goofs) delivers a lot of smiles of recognition for anyone who was around then.

235,anjru,Tsuris,10,11 November 2009,"This movie could have been titled ""Tsuris"" or, if you are not an insider, ""Life sucks and then you die."" Another masterpiece by the Coen Brothers who, on the strength of this film, have moved up on my directors depth chart to the number one spot, edging out Martin Scorcese. Serious Man takes place in 1967 and is about a nebbish (not to be confused with a schlub or schlemiel) physics professor whose life turns to garbage. There is a great cast of characters and classic scenes with neighbors, family members, rabbis, attorneys, doctors, colleagues and even a voice on the phone inquiring about overdue payments to a record club.In the midst of his worst and most shattering moments, our hero's 13-year-old son, who is anticipating his bar mitzvah, is most concerned with his dad adjusting the antennae on the roof so that the son can get better reception to watch F-Troop on his black-and-white TV. Among the scenes that I loved in this movie is one with a rabbi with whom our hero seeks counsel. The rabbi tells him a story that a dentist told him. I won't say more about that, except to say that the story itself and the telling of the story are mesmerizing and hilariously brilliant. And there are many, many more unforgettable scenes.One caveat; this is not a movie for everyone. However, if you don't get turned off by ethnic movies, Jewish in this case, and if you have a taste for the Coens (with a touch of David Lynch) then this is a must see.

It is simply a cleverly-written adaptation of the Book of Job.Every sentence in the movie has a link to another. It is remarkably well-crafted story. You may find it a little difficult to appreciate its intricacies if you have never heard of Job (on the other hand, if you have studied Job, you may find it a little unoriginal). My take is the Coens have created a good screenplay. There is a lot meaning in every word and it stands head and shoulders above most of their other banality (which are mostly stories of dim-witted low-lifes from smalltown-USA attempting some form of theft and falling fowl of unlucky circumstances).Yet, despite this positive, there is still a missing ingredient. Typical of all their work, the movie lacks substance and fulfillment.

237,vigcyn-665-195614,It should have been a contender,8,24 December 2013,"Every time, this film's on, I have to watch it. That quality alone defines it for me as a great movie. As others have noted, I have no idea why 'The Hudsucker Proxy', 'The Big Lebowski' and 'O Brother, where art thou?"" are more popular except that they're crasser and louder. In short, crowd pleasers.This is a quiet film and Michael Stuhlbarg's performance as the gentle, perplexed Larry Gopnick makes it a classic. He should have, at least, been nominated for an Oscar. Larry is a basically kind and intelligent human being who can't understand why his life is in total chaos. As a reasonable person of impeccable conduct, it stands to reason that circumstances around him should follow his thoughts and actions. Instead, his wife is leaving him for another man and he's on the verge of bankruptcy and public humiliation.As a mathematician, it's in his nature to be logical and he can't stop trying to make sense of it all. Like many whose world has crashed, he turns to faith and seeks out the counsel of rabbis who really know less than he does and can only rely on timeworn adages and obscure parables. There is a rabbi, considered wisest of the wise and holiest of the holy, and so importantly mysterious, Larry is never permitted to approach him. In a crucial scene, we discover this man is either senile or the truth is all the religious wisdom in the world might as well be the lyrics to a well-written rock song, in this case 'Somebody to Love'. No one can assign meaning to our lives; we have to do that, ourselves.Some people have complained that the characterization of Jews in this movie is anti-Semitic. That mystifies me and I'm Jewish, myself. These characters are far from perfect and for the most part, they're broadly portrayed, but that's the Coen Brothers' style whether the characters are Jewish, African-American or Minnesotans of Scandinavian background.

239,sassonlonner,The Goy's Teeth!,8,24 April 2018,"As someone who's gone to a Jewish day school for 13 years, this movie is hysterical, letting me understand a lot of subtle jokes, like when Danny reaches for his head while running in the wind for his Yamaka, and other really true Jewish stereotypes which may be more subtle to those watching the movie who are not Jewish. But seriously, you do not have to be Jewish to appreciate and enjoy this film. The main family is Jewish, but the movie as a whole is making a statement about religion and the concept of God as a whole (I happen to be an atheist by the way even though I've gone to Jewish day school). Anyone who can appreciate the concept of religion and faith will get a lot out of A Serious Man. Being honest, I'm the kind of person who when I hear something is about religion, I go into it thinking it's going to be boring, and it's going to be attempting to hypnotize me or something. Yet this movie is very different. Remember, it's directed by the Coen Brothers. They make movies about crime, and violence, not ""Praise the Lord"" crazy religious propaganda.
 The plot of the movie also revolves a lot about the idea of karma, and why do bad things happen to good things. The movie relies on the idea that there is a god, and not just any god, but a god who really couldn't care less about you, and is ready to let you die at a finger snap. The movie is full of quick turns of good and bad in the life of Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg), establishing the point that God will just do what he wants, and even the slightest wrongdoing may make him choose it's time for you to die.
 As a whole, I really enjoyed this movie. I thought it had a really good idea behind it, and love bringing the Coen Brothers style in on a movie about religion. Although the movie could have brought some more explanations to it about why Sy Ableman's name makes everyone gasp, and the ending could have gone a bit more in depth, and parts of it were a bit to vague for my liking.

240,frankopy-2,something funny happened....,7,10 December 2010,"Understanding of a movie helps, but understanding everything in it is hardly essential, as my bout with this film says to me. I mean, of physics, I know not a whit; of Jewishness, not a whole lot more. But of humor, I like to partake, and this one had me guffawing in parts, thanks mainly to the simply written dialog written for the lead character, whose life is such a mess. Sure, there are obscurities here (among them what the hell Richard Kind and his character are supposed to ad), but the fact is that before one pities the lead character, who certainly is pitiful in so many ways, one has to laugh heartily at his circumstances. The tone of the movie is what gets to me the most. It is as though one is back in high school and getting a dodge-around-it answer to question rather important to a teen but zinging over a teacher's head. Michael Stuhlberg is brilliant as the lead character to whom tenure would be heaven in his physics-laden existence (think Eugene Levy's second coming). I don't believe in giving directors/writers carte blanch approval because of illustrious histories, but it would be difficult to argue much with the originality the Cohens often bring to the playhouse.

Larry's wife is leaving him for one of his colleagues because he is a more ""serious man"". His brother who is developing algorithms to win at gambling is crashing on the couch and is not leaving in the foreseeable future. His son is a pothead, content to listen to Jefferson Airplane and avoid the class bullies. And his daughter is stealing from him in an attempt to pay for a nose job. And that's just the first half hour of the film! After finding money on his desk left behind by a student Larry tries to return the money only to find out it was a bribe. He is fighting for tenure and in seeking the wisdom of three rabbis Larry is turned down. And if that weren't quite enough he has his sexual frustrations thrown in his face in the form of his neighbor who sunbathes nude. The viewer struggles to place why God has allowed this to happen to Larry and many cannot figure out why. And that's the point, this happens for no reason at all. Joel and Ethan are classified as what convention would call cynics and their latest effort certainly leads credence to that. Trying to interpret God's message in all of this is futile.What A Serious Man lacks in typical Coen films: archetypes(Javier Bardem and Tommy Lee Smith in No Country, Tex in Raising Arizona), their regular stalwarts in John Turturro, George Clooney, or John Goodman or several murders to surprise; the audience Michael Stuhlbarg makes up for in performance. The Coens were right to trust their lead role to a relative unknown. Not recognizing Stuhlbarg as an actor helps connect the audience with his unbelievable bad luck. The film looks great aesthetically as well. Cinematographer Roger Deakins(No Country for Old Men, Reservation Road) calmly surveys the entire story as a very frenzied Larry attempts to put his life back together. It also features one of the most haunting rock song ever on film, Somebody to Love in a completely humorous manner.

242,hypathio7,The New Fiddler on the Roof!,10,29 November 2014,"The Coen brothers have created THE NEW FIDDLER ON THE ROOF! Here are the reasons I say that: first, the trailer in its own way presents a musical composition to us; second, the opening scene presents roughly the same time period and place; third, the story takes place in an almost exclusively Jewish community; fourth, the main character Larry is dealing with comparable family troubles and trying to find answers from God; and fifth, look at the poster.Now the Jefferson Airplane song Somebody to Love figures prominently into the movie too as does ceremonial Hebrew music for Larry's son's bar mitzvah. The opening Yiddish scene is darkly humorous and I suppose it is there to suggest the ancestors of the Gopniks may have caused a curse on the family. I have heard that the movie portrays a very authentic Jewish community especially in the way the characters speak and interact. Professor Larry Gopnik lives in America in the 1960's, so he only has two children, a son and a daughter, but his family and professional troubles turn his life on its head with divorce, marijuana, gambling, bribes, and seeking tenure. Wishing he were a rich man hasn't changed though! Being an educated man from the 20th century means Larry doesn't have conversations with God in the same way. He seeks three rabbis as links between him and God because the religious institution is really the only connection to tradition anymore, and being a mathematics/physics professor he is more versed in the Uncertainty Principle. Larry does actually venture up on his roof too, but not to fiddle. Well, wait... yes, by another definition of the word fiddle, Larry Gopnik is a fiddler on the roof. He tries to adjust the TV antenna for a show his son likes to watch and then he notices he can see his hot neighbor sunbathing nude.Sy Ableman is Larry's Lazar Wolf, but as with every other parallel to the old musical, there is a twist. Sy is the one described as a serious man and Larry through all his questioning and trying to fix his life crisis wants to be a serious man too. The cast is awesome! I think the Coen brothers have mixed tragic troubling moments with darkly humorous moments excellently. Like in No Country for Old Men, you may think the plot is being wrapped up all nice and neat, but then the story continues briefly and leaves you realistically (in a way fatalistically) hanging.

But ""Schroedinger's Cat"" is the ultimate expression of the rules of order, or G-d's work, leading off the cliff into the abyss of mystery.In the example Schroedinger published in 1935, a cat is in a box with a ""diabolical apparatus"" which kills the cat if a random subatomic particle decays. Modern physics, being invented at the time, made the absurd prediction that until you opened the lid to check, the cat was in some sort of blurred probability space of being alive/dead, and it only became actually dead (or alive) when you opened the lid to check. Observation changed reality. The cat is in a mysterious state, beyond our comprehension or belief until we look. Do we have faith? Einstein didn't. He countered stating that ""G-d doesn't play dice with the universe!"" Schroedinger was doubtful, but insisted that the mystery was simply inescapable. This is the foundation for a rich allegory, indeed.""I don't understand the mathematics, but I understand the stories,"" Larry's Korean student insists. ""No, if you don't understand the math, you don't understand the physics. Even I sometimes don't understand the stories,"" Larry shoots back.And in this lies the nub of the tale. Larry understands the rules--and follows them. His life is dreary and takes a seeming nose dive. Plague after plague arise and he is perplexed. One rabbi says ""We all question the existence of hashem (""his name"" = G-d) and then we see the wonder in...the parking lot."" HE GETS IT!! For him it is faith. Even the friggin' parking lot is a divine miracle! The next rabbi weaves a deeply mystical tale with a banal ending. Larry is outraged. ""What does it mean?"" ""How do I know. G-d does't owe us an explanation. The responsibility is the other way around,"" the rabbi responds. They each have their own understanding and advise. The young rabbi is not yet wise and advises faith. The next rabbi acknowledges mystery, but says it is beyond us to understand, so be a good person, ""or a better person."" ""God doesn't owe us an explanation. The responsibility runs the other way.""It soon becomes clear that the Korean student and his father have a razor-sharp understanding of the ""Schroedinger's Cat"" story and thrust the paradox into Larry's life with a vengeance. If only Larry understood the paradox.But he understands logic and rules. His faith is shaky, but he follows the rules. Sy doesn't believe a G-d is watching him, steals his friends wife, and G-d strikes him down in his path.Even Larry's brother, believes in a crazy half-physics, half-Kaballah mystery and he actually wins card games with it, but he breaks the rules and is a pariah. The last rabbi will not even talk to him. The most direct response of G- d being questioned by a doubting subject.At the end, Larry feels he is through his trial and ""opens the box"" to check to see if there is a G-d there. Surprise! There is! He opened the box by breaking the rules. The cat is dead. All his plagues had only been in some sort of blurred probability space of having happened/not happened; his marriage, his tenure the whole chain of events. It was not until he tested G-d by breaking a rule that the very real G-d of the bible smote him and his eldest son down. The original Job had actual punishments and kept his faith. Our modern Job has existential punishments and ends with a lack of faith. We must have faith, recognize the mysteries or obey the law according to our capacity, but to do none of these is an abomination.",A Serious Man
244,workingclasshero,A meaningless movie about nothing important,2,2 June 2010,"All the sense I could make of this movie I could say in one sentence: if you act like a moron, your life will be miserable. OK, got it. And how to change that? The Coen brothers may plan to get to that part in another movie, because in this one, that was not on the agenda.So our hero, the moron, lets the people around him treat him like crap in every way imaginable. And that's about it. It's not even funny, because the same things keep happening over and over, until it is practically unbearable to watch. At least it was for me.There is nothing to identify with, unless you act like the moron in the movie, which I doubt, because nobody acts like that. And the few people that may do, I hope for them they will change, but their misery doesn't interest me in the least as long as they just continue repeating it, when they could change it any minute.So why would someone watch that film? I have no idea. There is nothing to be learned, no entertainment to be found. Well, if you are interested in Jewish culture, you may find a thing or two. It is portrayed with some degree of self-parody, but not really funny. There is an air of pseudo-intellectualism, like in those clever philosophy books where they manage to say nothing in a really complicated manner, and then you feel inclined to act impressed because you're not sure whether it's just you who didn't get the message, or if there simply were no message.

245,stevespeedy,sow the wind and reap the whirlwind,7,9 January 2010,"This film is hard to categorize. It's obviously not riotously funny, the drama is low tension, so it must be a documentary. It's not about a latter-day Job, either. That biblical hero lost everything and emerged triumphant because of his faith in God above.A professor is living the great American nightmare. It's the tail-end of the 1960s with all of its goofy protesting and free love and tolerance. His shrew bitch of a wife wants to leave him for a bald-headed quack pop psychologist with a nicer car. Prof Gopnick is the sum total of his fears. Fear of the future, fear of relationships, and especially fear of his red-meat neighbor plotting against him. His children are awful, his brother is an idiot savant child molester who cheats the mob.It's rather a docudrama about jews in deepest darkest Minneapolis who must deal with each other on both a professional and spiritual levels. He meets specialist lawyers who are no help, rabbis who wax philosophical about parking lots and goy teeth. The tenure committee would rubber-stamp him in if it were not for some malicious letters, and then there's that pesky bribe hanging over him like the sword of Damocles. Fortunately, Gopnick gets the inside skinny which enables him to take the money with a clear conscience to pay the lawyer for his brother's sins.It ends with a tornado blowing across the suburban prairie, which by no means answers why the opening skit had anything to do with what followed.",A Serious Man

This is the type of a movie that one can only enjoy if she/he watches it with great depth and concentration.After watching the whole movie, one would wonder if it the first scene of A Serious Man had any connection with the movie - but it does. It sets up the whole movie.The movie never tells us whether the old man in the first scene was a dybbuk (not telling what it is, you'll know if you watch it) or a normal man. The movie then continues with our protagonist, who's a teacher of a Uni, explaining Schrodinger's Cat equation. One can relate the first scene with Schrodinger's Cat equation.Without giving away any spoilers, the film starts with a quote that tells us to receive everything with simplicity. And the movie also teaches us exactly that (when our main protagonist questions God on why he's going through a turmoil in life despite not doing any sins); that some questions of life will be unanswered and that the Lord doesn't owe us any answers - or, for that matter, anything at all.Yet, after watching the ending of the movie, you won't be able to take it simply - you will ask questions. This movie is a paradox, just like Schrodinger's Cat quantum theorem. You will think that the plot is scattered, but it is not - it is a plot woven into a tapestry asking the viewers to view life simply (note the ambivalence/paradox in the sentence - that is exactly what this movie is).Reiterating what I said earlier, this is the best allegory movie I have ever seen. The acting of everyone was superb. Also, this is a dark comedy movie and there are some hilarious scenes every now and then which will definitely make you laugh.A must-watch movie for all which I rate at 9/10.",A Serious Man

Also, I don't like the way the movie portrays non-jews as a lesser or inferior being.If millionaire writers/directors who are bored and decide to self indulge in a little movie about their religion, there should be a disclaimer on the box.Before thousands of Jewish people get offended; This isn't a derogatory poke at Jewish people, the movie could of been about any religion, Sikh, Hindi, Catholic, the same principle applies.

Giving a movie 7.2 means that movie was good, certainly an enjoyable experience but not exactly memorable, perhaps a feel-good movie with some nice performances, but that's it.But giving A Serious Man a 7.2 is probably clear proof that we're heading towards the end and our fall can no longer be prevented. This is tragic. This means we no longer enjoy movies for what they are, this means the end of an era. You're telling me that Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind gets an 8.4 on the chart and is in top 250, but A Serious Man gets a 7.2? And I don't mean to insult the movies in top 250. I generally think most of them deserve to be there. But I just can't sit by and acknowledge these glaring injustices. The Proposal, that 2009 romantic comedy that was anything but sweetly mediocre got a 6.8 rating. And you might love Sandra Bullock and give her a ten no matter what she does, but how can you give A Serious Man only 7.2? I know I'm subjective right now, but this really pisses me off. This movie is amazing. It is a brilliant satire and a beautiful look into a troubled man's life. The sheer humour and absurdity of this story should be enough to make it one of the best movies of 2009 and a Coen brothers achievement. But instead we get a 7.2.Shakespeare in Love got a 7.4 but no, A Serious Man gets a solid...7.2.And another thing, it was nominated at the Oscars but won no award, whereas Startrek went home with one in the bag.

251,zetret,serious man,8,5 March 2010,"A SERIOUS MAN Writers: Ethan and Joel Coen Nominated for Oscar. A definite contender.This is probably the toughest movie to write a review for and that's precisely why I am doing it. Another dark comedy from the Coen brothers ( following the impressive list of Big Lebowski, Fargo, Burn After Reading etc) and it definitely needs patience and a lot of thinking.The movie is set in the 1970's(or the end 60's) in the Minneapolis suburbs mainly focusing on the Jewish community. Larry is a Physics professor seeking the true understanding of the life in this universe. He is faced with a myriad of problems professionally and personally. His tenure is up for a review at school, his son's Bar Mitzvah is about to be held that weekend , his wife decides to leave him and he is not sure what all this means to him in his life. He teaches the Schrödinger's uncertainty principle at class and is not sure if it's uncertainty everywhere.I shall explain the Schrodinger's cat paradox here.Schrödinger published this in 1935. The paradigm consisted of a cat in a box with a ""diabolical apparatus"" which kills the cat if a random subatomic particle decays. Modern physics, made the absurd prediction that until you opened the lid to check, the cat was in some sort of a probability space of being alive/dead, and it only became actually dead (or alive) when you opened the lid to check. Observation changed reality. The cat is in a mysterious state, beyond our comprehension or belief until we look. Do we have faith? Schrödinger insisted that the mystery was simply inescapable. This is the foundation for a rich allegory, indeed. (Einstein did not completely agree with this theory) At last, Larry, after meeting with the Rabbis decides it's time to ""open the box"" He accepts the bribe from a Korean student ( an immoral act) to change his grades. The next moment, he discovers from his doctor that he has a probably terminally ill disease. Also, his son's school is hit by a tornado.Watch it once or twice.

252,blogandsqualor,Best Coen Bros. Yet,10,20 December 2009,"The Coen Brothers, with the exception of one film (I'm assuming I don't need to remind you of the frustrating Burn After Reading) never disappoint in the their delivery of intriguing stories, incredible performances, and hilarious comedic antics wedged in the midst of dark sadism. But with A Serious Man, they outdo even their best work, unearthing true cinematic excellence with a pervading sense of existential doom to create a lyrical masterpiece.The trailer foreshadowed the film's tone with its hypnotic beat, a clock exponentially counting down, a rhythm present in every scene and splice of the film. The subtle tension it builds as victim and passive protagonist Larry Gopnik's (Michael Stuhlbarg who melts into the role) life spirals into oblivion, prevents the story from slipping into the boring or schlocky, and fully grounds the often overly zany Coen humor (at best in the Big Lebowski, at its worst in Burn After Reading).Our recent pop culture obsession with the sixties is a powerful one. The suburban disillusionment, waning economy, and struggle with new freedoms visible every Sunday night during Mad Men, something we can all currently relate to. The Coen's play fully upon this familiarity, show-casing the starkness of the flat suburbs and the clean concrete lines of the college where Larry works. Even the Synagogue is perfectly paneled with the kind of stifling interior you'd rip out immediately if given the chance.While the vision is bleak, it is also beautiful. The brothers skillfully mix a strong sense of mystical Jewish culture (the prequel starring Fyvush Finkel as a possible dybbuk, who I'm convinced may actually be one in real life, sets the initial tone), and find a strange reluctant splendor in the suburban Midwest landscape through brilliant cinematography. As in their previous works like No Country For Old Men, they prove again that they understand atmosphere and how it can make a movie. There is something haunting in the echo of opera through the perfectly ordered house as Larry and his mentally off brother (Richard Kind showing off his dramatic acting chops) share the living room sofa, or when his young son practices for his Bar Mitzvah with the the F-Troop on in the background. The frightening mystery of science, physics, and mathematics is also expertly woven into the religious and philosophical fabric of the film, making its punch even greater in force. No existential curiosity goes unquestioned.Seething underneath, you can sense the primal power of God, fate, or chance (whatever you decide to call it). But despite all Larry goes through, the Coen's seem to leave the nature and intentions of that force up for interpretation.This ""show,"" don't ""tell"" attitude makes all the difference. As Gopnik glides through the film with only a slight neurotic unraveling invisible to his wife seeking a divorce, his religious leaders, coworkers, and lifeless children, you laugh at the disgusting hilarity of his situation, but also cringe, as the powers of the universe seem to take particular joy in destroying the short time that Larry has on this earth. As anyone whose experienced the heavy hand of said ""powers that be"" can tell you, that's exactly what it feels like. There are moments of conspiracy, in which you assume that everyone but you seems in on the joke. Each step seems to lead to another catastrophe, a descent into madness that often leaves you laughing and puzzled more than angry. Like Larry you seek help, in a book or a religious counselor, in friends. You question what you've been doing wrong, you move forward. You wonder what the future holds. But like Larry, you never know if the cat is alive or dead, or if it even matters; a Coen message at its very best.",A Serious Man
253,Ampero,Serious Coen Genius,6,26 January 2010,"Being a fan of most of the Coen Brother's works I adjusted quite well to A Serious Man.The movie follows the increasingly uncomfortable bad luck streak of Lawrence/Larry Gopnik and his family. Things start to unravel for Larry when his wife surprises him with a divorce that she wants and he seeks council with three Rabbis, while his tenure as a professor is scrutinized by a series of anonymous letters. The humor is quite dry and lightly dark at times while the progression is a steady pace that may not bode well for most viewers. The casual moviegoer may fiend dismay as this doesn't deliver the usual quick turnaround on plot surprises and jokes as the normal comedy would. That factor, however, only adds to the unique likability of this story, so it's a bit of a win-win I feel.While being set in 1967, there's also a large Jewish element in this movie, so much so that it feels authentic and gives you a culture burst as you explore and feel for the characters. Larry has a wife, Judy; two teenage kids, Danny and Sarah; and a brother hard on his luck, Arthur - played by Richard Kind. Judy, being fed-up with some ambiguous problems in her marriage seeks confidence with Sy Abelman, a family friend and they both plod steps to not only plan the divorce but make it ritualized, or as the Jewish say, ""have a Get"". Sibling chiding occurs with the two children and the movie chooses to show a bit of Danny's life as he is about to be Bar Mitzvah'd and the nuances that surround being lightly rebellious at a Hebrew School and enjoying marijuana. The seemingly socially inept Arthur evens out the core cast as a moocher staying with the family whilst sorting out the math to cheat card games. Illegal card games at that.All in all, A Serious Man is a decent watch, if you stick it through. It's not as rewarding as it could be but as a 'looking-in' piece it's pretty enjoyable seeing and feeling what Larry has to go through then thinking 'WTF' to yourself when the comedic conflicts pop-up.Standout Line: 'The Rabbi is busy.' ""He doesn't look busy!"" 'He's thinking.'",A Serious Man
254,DavidStewart57,Seriously Brilliant!,10,9 November 2009,"When you're going into a movie theater, you don't know if you're going to be watching gold, or watching pure crap. After watching the first ten minutes of A Serious Man, I knew I had struck gold. The next 95 minutes grabbed me by the throat and didn't let go without laughing or crying. Arguably, the Coen Brothers have topped themselves with this crowning comical achievement. Set in Minnesota in the late Nineteen-Sixties- semi-autobiographical to the Coens- Larry Gopnik, a middle-aged physics professor embodies Job by being pelted with divorce, his job and his enigmatic brother while questioning his Jewish faith. The pain grows with Larry's self-absorbed teenage daughter and his son, who soldiers through Hebrew school with a hand-held radio and a lid of weed.Playing first-mate aboard the Coen's Cruiser is cinematographer, Roger Deakins. Deakins captures the monotony of Midwestern suburbia that echoes American Beauty with an approach that would make Hitchcock grin, along with towering angle shots and drug-infused sequences that mirror Schlesinger's Sunday Bloody Sunday. Carter Burwell's romantic, yet haunting, blend of piano and strings flows throughout the film's damned protagonist as he cycles around through id and superego. On top of Burwell's score is an unforgettable blend of Jimi Hendrix and, primarily, Jefferson Airplane.Michael Stuhlbarg has pounded the floorboards of New York reciting Shakespeare for the past decade. After seeing A Serious Man, you will be talking about Stuhlbarg's intense, brooding, and funny performance as Larry Gopnik; this is a performance worthy of speculation and adulation. Richard Kind takes his comedic shtick from ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" and gets darker as Larry's deadbeat brother. Amy Landecker adds another weight onto Larry's back as a seductive neighbor who plagues his mind with the sexual energy and gravitas of Anne Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson.If you want cheep laughs and thrills, this is not the film for you. If you want to be philosophically and theologically mind warped, than get as close to the screen as you can. A Serious Man is, seriously, the best film of the year.

The story focuses mainly around Larry (some Jewish dude, living in the late 60s, a maths teacher) and his family, and how he's convinced the forces of El Shaddai are against him. Plainly put, the moral of the story is ""it comes and goes"" but like so many Coens films, it illustrates this with such engaging and varied episodic scenes and shots. At first, there was always the fear that the fact the main characters had such strong faith in Judaism would restrict their personalities on screen but as the film progressed, these fears were soon quashed. Oh, and despite the usual Jewish hymns and songs, the majority of the soundtrack is compiled entirely of tracks from Jefferson Airplane's ""Surrealistic Pillow"" LP including ""Today"" (featured in one very sexy scene I should add). A rabbi even quotes ""Somebody to Love"" to Larry's son, Danny, at his bar mitzvah.

260,redhairedlad,The most challenging Coen movie yet.,10,28 November 2009,"My wife and I loved this movie; we have been huge fans of the Coens for a long time. However, this time I think the viewer is expected to bring a couple of things to the table in order to have a satisfying experience with it.First of all is a familiarity with the Coens' way of doing things. Sure their films are ""quirky"" which is so often used to describe their work. But it goes beyond that. For one thing every one of their films are different from the other, there are no formulas. That being said, one finds oneself saying ""That scene is classic Coen."" There are passages of passages of almost surrealism. I found it interesting that the bulk of songs come from Jefferson Airplane's 1967 ""Surrealistic Pillow"" Surrendering to a Coen movie is kind of like being willing to enter a world view. Next, one is going to have to bring along a willingness to get immersed in Jewish mysticism. This is beyond Jewish slang, into deep Kabbalistic notions,and deeply held Jewish beliefs about how the basic questions of life are answered and about nature of morality and evil. There is a big dose of Coen humor thrown in for good measure, and the period detail is amazing. It is a must for all Coen fans. However, I would click on the ""Jewish phrases"" link found on this page.I might also say that I enjoyed being able to strongly identify with the character Larry, the hero.",A Serious Man
261,robert-broerse,A Torture Chamber for Losing Time,3,17 January 2010,"The only thing fairly remarkable or remotely intriguing about this film is the opening wherein a Yiddish-speaking Jew of the 19th century invites (accidentally) a dybbuk (evil spirit in the shape of a man) into his family home. The ominous turn of events and the wife's sensible solution to the situation is comical and you would think the film would build on such an interesting prologue.Alas, like reading the Book of Job without the good parts (namely the philosophical arguments and the poetry, let alone a resolution), A Serious Man feels like an exercise in viewing torture. (What is it about 2009? The Road and A Serious Man both belong in the category of 'agonizing to watch...).Maybe the brilliance of this film lies in that you think at any minute this honest, good, hard-working Jewish man will crack and finally take on the world that is besetting him as opposed to questioning G-d. But for much of the film, our lead character, Larry Gopnik, a professor, husband, father of two, brother of socially-inept Adam, there is little here that happens, let alone satisfies a viewing audience.It has been awhile before I watched a film wherein I continually battled with myself over whether I should continue or simply walk away. I wanted to walk away...What made this film the most unbearable is how each periphery character rarely ever showed their humanity - Larry's Son and Daughter are simply cretins, the former a typical high school student with bully problems and marijuana indulgence (also he orders records of the month and leaves the bill for his father) while his daughter's only needs in life seem to be her hair and going out. There is no dimension to either of them while their mother, Larry's wife is a loveless shrew that remarkably makes Larry pay for his rival's funeral, an arrogant friend of the family named Sy. Throughout the first half of the film, Sy and Larry's wife are in love, working on Larry to get a kosher divorce.After awhile, I lost sympathy for the lead, not because of his wife and family, but because he had wandered into a cinematic world lacking humanity, let alone real people. The Coens have not crafted a movie, let alone a film but an alternate universe, a torture chamber of bland direction and characterization. It has been awhile since I watched a film where I felt I despised so many characters. Ideally, supporting characters are there to create relationships, to reveal the complexity of human life. It seems everyone here is just another means to stab the lead and bludgeon him with their inane presence. Even the rabbi who refuses to talk to him feels less like a person as opposed to a forced story development.If you were the kid in school who didn't torture earth worms or pull butterfly wings off Monarchs, then you might not like this debacle, another pseudo-film from the Coen Brothers.",A Serious Man

The performances are good from Richard Kind, Michael Stuhlbarg, and the always great Fred Melamed. There are some funny scenes and jokes here and there, as expected from the Coen's. It gets a 6 based on those elements and the Coen's reputation alone. Apart from that it seems more like a movie based on their collective experience growing up in Minnesota.

The Cohen Bros go through the essential and particular, fillet it, and reveal the universal. The key ingredient of any art work. In 'A Serious Man', the essential: life, marriage, family, job and responsibility. With the particular: the prism of being Jewish. All that is Cohen flashes brilliant here: screenplay, direction and editing. If I taught film-making at University, this work of art would be screened. When I saw 'No Country for Old Men', I said, ""This will win the Oscar for Best Picture. 'A Serious Man' is beyond comparison to other films for awards. It enters the rarified domain of Art. I saw Woody Allen breach that rare place with 'Star Dust Memories'. A certain lack of acceptance of the film by HIM, returned him to convention. So, now I wonder, will the Cohen Bros go forward?

266,monstermanforever,A Slice Of Life Without A Point,7,29 September 2010,"I am a real fan of the Coen Brothers. They have made so many wonderful movies that it is difficult for me to pick a favorite.A Serious Man is an interesting film. It is like a slice of life segment from a sixties Jewish family. We meet a dysfunctional nuclear family and numerous people in their community who seem obsessed with humiliating the father. He is repeatedly taken advantage of and instead of standing up for himself, which is what would happen in most movies of this type, he shrugs and sets himself up for another round. It becomes frustrating to see him do this over and over.It is my understanding that A Serious Man was intended as a comedy. There are times when this is obvious but there are many more times when it is not. The finale invites you to make up your own mind, not only about the resolution, but about what the purpose of the movie was. The biggest question becomes was there a purpose? This wasn't a bad film. I doubt that the Coen Brothers could make one. A Serious Man does seem an odd entry in their cannon because it meanders from one humiliating experience to another without any sense of purpose. Some of the reviewers who found such substance to it seem to be giving it much more credit than it deserves.",A Serious Man
267,pittplay-1,More further thought,9,14 November 2009,"I have seen this movie five time in theaters and have the DVD, and figured out last spring. Just as Dorothy, Scare Crow, Tin Man and Coward Lion go to find the wizard to help them with their difficulties, so Larry needs answers. He needs to find someone with the answers and goes to his attorney, who wisely consults other attorneys, the first and second Rabbis, the hot wife next door Mrs Samsky, his brother Arthur, even his wife and Su Ableman. He can find no one with the answers. The Twister at the end of the movie, a strange ending if there was ever one, is a clue to what this move is really about ; it's the Coen brothers version of The Wizard of Oz. Getting through life as best you can hopefully there will be wise advise along the way, but he nest is you were born lucky.OK I have seen this move three times, below is my original post about my first impression, and have enjoyed it each time. Thinking about it further, it seems to be about finding a philosophy that can guild one through the maze that is life or human existence. For some it is religion, others science, others racism, others culture, others a heritage, etc. Rabbi Marshck's response to young Danny is interesting. He is saying to him about the lines from the song here is your times, your life, they are OK, be a good boy. This is very wise, live in your times I judge you, (Danny), not. Post from November 14Sorry there is no yellow brick road, 14 November 2009 ￼ Author: (pittplay@gmail.com) from United StatesI love this movie. No I am not a scholar, biblical or otherwise , just a dumb ex-mill hunky from Pittsburgh who was ejected from the ninth grade. In a nut shell, its simply about dealing with life's adversities; good luck. It's a lot of fun. Half way through this movie I decided that it was like a Woody Allen movie, Broadway Danny Rose or Crimes and Misdemeanors. But then it changed, it went deeper and got nuttier. Mel Brook's Twelve Chairs or his original The Producers came to mind. At the end I came down to that this movie is an original. There is no yellow brick road to a wizard that can answer all of life's questions. I didn't try to find any deeper meaning in A Serious Man, I guess I am like the lead character Larry Gopnik, just trying to get to the next sunrise in one piece and my sanity intact. No I am not Jewish, but an atheist. I will see it again, and again.About the parable and it's meaning relating to the movie. It is confusing, but the Coens have a habit of sometimes putting a scene into their movies that have nothing to do with the over all plot. In Fargo the sheriff Marge Gunderson meets an old high school friend, and he tries to put a move on the very pregnant Marge. The scene has little to do with he movie. Correction. After reading other comments and post on the Internet Movie Data Base, IMDb, the beginning parable is clear to me, somewhat? Others at IMDb suggested that to understand the beginning review Schrodinger's Cat on Wikipedia, its a paradox or thought experiment. This cleared up the beginning of the movie for me, and whether or not it has anything to do with he rest of the plot, you will have to decided. The Coen brothers like to skip back and forth across the conscious and unconscious mind. The best example is Barton Fink. A Serious Man goes a little further than that wonderful movie. One day I think they will make a movie solely in the unconscious. Fellini would be proud of them.",A Serious Man

After an interesting, albeit unrelated prologue we are introduced to a protagonist whose life is soon to be turned upside down when his wife asks for a divorce, both legally and religiously, so that she may marry a man whom with she may or may not be having an affair. He's up for tenure and the review board is receiving obscene letters in an attempt to damage his character. There's many factors at play, slowly working on him that act as cathartic humor to release the tensions of our own existential angst by seeing someone else go through all of the worst first world problems that a middle aged white man could go through in a lifetime. Definitely a must see for anyone that enjoys laughing at uncomfortable situations.",A Serious Man
272,wanderlazaro-21994,Prepare to get lost,6,10 October 2021,"A serious man portrays the life of middle aged mild man Larry Gopnick during a couple of days. His menial suburban lifestyle is little by little turned upside down due to events that seem to be completely out of his control. During the movie, Larry becomes more and more helpless due to the events, nd because of that he is convinced by a friend to see a rabbi that is considered a wise man. There, Larry could open up and maybe get some guidance. Larry tries to get hold of the old rabbi (called Marshak), but never gets the chance to talk to him. Instead he talks to the available rabbis. They both give unsound and general advice letting Larry even more confused.By the end of the movie Larry thinks his life is going to get back on track,for a second, just to (probably) receive some devastating news from his doctor some minutes after the movie ends.I've watched the movie more than one time and I've read and I've watched some reviews. The movie has a very open and interpretative path to get to the meaning behind it. Some people take Larry as Job from the old testament, supposedly getting punished just to test his faith. And since Larry has some sins portrayed (repressed sexual desires that come out as dreams) on the movie and gets corrupted by the end (accepting money for illegal activities), then according to that interpretation his suffering is justified. But this interpretation seems to me as a mistake, because Larry (that seems to be the most moral character in the movie) is punished even before everyone of his sins happen on the screen. In the first 3 minutes of the movie (cutting out the old folktale) Larry is at the doctor. There he takes some X rays. At that moment, Larry's fate is set. We try to fit forcibly some religious interpretation ad hoc but it just does not seem to fit. If Larry is a good, moral man before the film starts, which is implied that he is, then it would not be fair that he would get a serious (possibly terminal) disease even before his first appearance( since the x-rays only serves to diagnose his disease not to cause it).For most people all the rabbis in the movies are portrayed as buffoons that try to solve Larry's problems through:
(1) general common place advice that can be giving to anyone by pretty much anyone, because there is no psychological or theological background needed to say ""try to see things in a new perspective"" and ""God is everywhere you look you just need to want to see him"" and ""you have to see those things as expression of god's will"".(2) Convoluted parable; that take five minutes to tell Larry that ""we can olny know what god wants us to know""The third rabbi (Marshak), supposedly the wise one, does not talk to Larry during the movie. Although, he speaks to Larry's 14 yo stoner son (Daniel) after his bar mitzvah. And boy, what disappointment that was. I though that the old rabbi was going to talk about the profound and obscure side of our human nature through many historical and religious references that would make Daniel a more thoughtful and mature young man. Then, the rabbi recites part of a song from the airplanes, forgets the name of one the members of the band(what betrays his senility due to old age) and to close it off with the most original thought provoking advice: ""be a good boy"".The world is truly a bleak place. Apparently, even the most sage rabbi is as confusing and useless as the other ones.To me the movie ""a serious man"" tell us that religion in general is a secure shelter that we run towards when we truly are in despair. When the world seems to make no sense, we face the senselessness of the world through embracing the senselessness of religion. Larry is a rational man. As a professor of physics, he developed a scientific, rational psychological framework. For Larry, just like for newton, Actions have consequences. That's sound a lot like Newtonian physics(that have religious roots). It's a consistent morality for a consistent universe. IF for every action there is a equal opposite reaction THEN the universe is fairly predictable. If we adapt that for a religious moral framework we have: IF Larry did not do anything wrong THEN everything will be fine. But still, for Larry, there is always a bad consequences. This seem not to fit in the religious/Newtonian psychological framework(where good people are blessed and bad people are punished) that Larry follows. This happens because it follows the new XX century quantum physics framework, where the chaos ensues. Not even Larry's rationality can really understand the fundamental truths derived from it expressed in non mathematical language. Because there are fundamentally none or there are many. Everything is probabilistic. Only through math we can really proof what seems to be going on the universe. There is no complete consistency, If and THEN definitive statements seems to have no place here. Sometimes causes and consequences seems to be switched. That is one way of interpretation that seems to justify Larrys suffering. That can be interpreted in two ways:(1) Either Larry suffered because there is no god nor divine justice and under the hood of daily reality things are (fundamentally) chaotical and senseless. We do what we can and hope for the best, but no guarantees.(2) or Larry suffered because god knew in his infinite wisdom that Larry was a corrupt man even before Larry corrupted himself. God knew the cause of Larry's suffering before the effect.But, to be honest this second religious explanation is a apologetic way of trying to fit religion again into the new scientific theories of the last century. It also heavily relies upon the incapacity of the viewer to know much about the real quantum physics. In the quantum world causes and consequences do seem to be switched in some instances, but they are restrict to only the micro verse of atoms and molecules. They are not applicable directly in our daily lives. Sean Carrol and Lawrence Krauss, are two serious physics professors that have said many times that quantum mechanics are often used to justify mysticism. So let's disregard the option number two because it is usually used by gurus trying to sign you up in a cult or sell you something. (The option number two also create great philosophical problems with free will that were never solved for church philosophers) and so we conclude that we are stuck with option one.The option one is not the one we'd like, but is the one we have, In the movie and in life.

In this respect it is so extremely postmodern that I think this script was written to make fun of film critics.In any case, the 1960s fashion, cars, furniture and set designs are awesome, incredibly detailed and elaborate, and I enjoyed looking at these much more than following the plot.",A Serious Man

They don't do ""bad"" movies, in the sense that they are great at directing, casting the right people, using original dialogs and believable characters and generally fulfilling every need that most Hollywood flicks are not, because those are centered around entertainment rather than sophistication. This movie is no exception to that rule.That being sad, I would have really liked to see more entertainment in this one. As an atheist I can't relate to the religious problems and questions addressed in this movie, but even if I could, I'm sure I would not really have enjoyed it.The plot is, for lack of a better word, boring. There were a few funny moments, but nothing really hilarious, and black comedy is the only genre this movie seems to fit. I know it's chic to end movies right in the expected middle of the plot nowadays to add a certain artistic feeling to the movie, but I hate unresolved story lines that cut off right when it starts to get interesting, and I know I'm not the only one feeling that way.Long story short: Great film-making and directing, lack of entertainment and excitement.

I waited until the end to see a revelation or a critical turn over of the events because without that the movie is about nothing.

""A Serious Man""'s aim is clearly revisiting that somewhat forgotten second strand of the Bros' work, and boy does it deliver. Until today I thought ""Barton Fink"" was their best work. I am not so sure anymore. Being brilliantly acted, wonderfully shot, beautifully designed and ingeniously written are just some of the immense qualities of this picture. Seldom can a story of so little a scope become so greatly engaging and moving. Scene after scene, we somewhat cruelly delight in the protagonist's sufferings.

This was THAT movie for me. From the moment I saw the trailer, I was hooked: a timid, Jewfro-sporting man being repeatedly slammed face-first against a blackboard by a tracksuit-clad giant to the beat of Jefferson Airplane's ""Somebody to love"" as he says ""I f***ed your wife! I really f***ed her!"". The film begins with a Yiddish folktale which appears (on first viewing) to be detached from the style of the rest of the film. What follows are a series of mishaps and misfortunes that revolve (mainly) around Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) and ultimately persuade him to seek the advice of three Rabbis. Larry is then plunged into an existential crisis that seems only to exacerbate when he tries different ""perspectives"". The Coen brothers are not strangers to providing off-kilter insight to life's mysteries. Their off-beat comedies (The Big Lebowski, Burn After Reading, The Ladykillers) provide their viewers with humor in subtlety. It is this subtlety and gentle nod to the deeper meaning that carries through to their more ""serious"" work (The Man Who Wasn't There, No Country for Old Men). For me, what sets this film apart from their other (arguably) more renowned works is the gravity that hits you when you realize the simple (yet effective) way they have crafted an entire film to ensure every moment resonates THE MESSAGE. If you are expecting this film to give you all the answers, then you will be disappointed. Therein lies the meaning. This is the futility of questioning that which we cannot know.

But it was far from a good film from my point of view.First of all, I am a Jew, so I understood more than most of the people who watched this movie who arn't from that religion, though I have to admit, I didn't understand that much. The beginning scene has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, it was just like a detached part of the film. And what comes next, well, basically nothing. The whole movie seems like it's building toward some climax, explanation, conclusion, something, but it dosn't happen. The movie ends with nothing to gain, just as if it was cut off in the middle, though the middle didn't have much to say either.Now, i know that a lot of films likes to look artsy and make the audience think about it, basically, i don't like that style but there are some movies that i can enjoy somehow after reading the explanation and figuring out what the film was about if I missed it's intent. Here there was no need to, it was so irritating that no explanation could help solve the mystery's of the movie for me.I saw two of their previous films and didn't liked them also so i should have known that I wont enjoy this one either, but i realized who the directors were only after i saw it.I guess that if your a fan of the Cohen brothers you might enjoy this film as it's their style but if you haven't liked a film by their creation before, stay away from this one, most likely you'll be annoyed by the two hours of your life that wont come back.",A Serious Man

The fact that this film is over 7 on IMDb is a disgrace! and should have never been nominated for any type of award. This is not the worst film but their is nothing that separates it from hundreds of other films of the same nature. I watched just over an hour hoping it would start taking direction but it just didn't! other then their being some solid acting the storyline was about as interesting as watching cricket!

I don't see how people got dark/comedy from this film. A satire or dark comedy would be ""Ghost World"" or ""American Psycho"" not this film.

Nice guy this god. I'd like to buy it a drink one day. Then kill it.What I saw, not being Jewish or familiar with the old testament or any of that junk, was a painful to watch series of personal disasters happen to an otherwise nice guy for NO APPARENT REASON.

293,blaksun,"Despite being extrapolation on concepts that any fan of the Coen brothers is now familiar with, A Serious Man feels like the most personal film the brothers have made.",8,25 October 2009,"A Serious Man, the latest offering from film-making brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, presents us with their truest representation of the universe we live in: completely unpredictable, and occupied with exaggerated stereotypes of Jewish suburbanites that still manage to be compelling human characters. Alongside this theme of an ordered existence in a chaotic world, the Coens draw upon The Book of Job and their Jewish upbringing to create a darkly comic tragedy about physics professor Larry Gropnik (Michael Stuhlbarg), whose life and faith unravel over the course of the film.Set in Minnesota during the '60s, we are introduced to Larry ostensibly in the prime of his life: he has a wife, a daughter, a son whose bar mitzvah is approaching, and his brother Arthur (Richard Kind) sleeping on the couch; he has a house in the suburbs and his application for tenure is undergoing review. All of these things, however, are revealed as imperfect: Larry's son Danny (Aaron Wolf) smokes marijuana and is being hounded by a classmate for money; his daughter Sarah (Jessica McManus) steals from his wallet, and is a generally unpleasant person; and his troubled brother is afflicted with a repulsive physical ailment that keeps him from socializing -- or finding his own apartment. Larry lives in an inattentive bliss that is rudely interrupted when a student attempts to bribe him for a passing grade, and his wife Judith (Sari Lennick) tells him that she's leaving him for family friend Sy Abbelman (Fred Melamed). Larry is put through the wringer, obviously manipulated by a malignant force (God, or the Coen brothers?) that tears down his comfortable world, piece by piece, causing Larry to seek counsel from three rabbis. Their advice is in turn inept, meaningless, and, in the wise old Marshak (Alan Mandell) refuses to even speak; he is forced by circumstances to make his own decisions concerning personal ethics and his faith in Hashem (""The Name""). Larry's downward spiral continues, forcing the viewer into a sadistic role where he is forced by the script to take pleasure in his pain, and ending on a truly ominous note with no denouement in sight.The Coens' films share common concepts, of an unpredictable universe, the breaking point of personal ethics and faith, and the consequences thereof; all of the Coen brothers' films use the core idea of a chaotic universe to propel their various plots (see: Burn After Reading, The Big Lebowski, Fargo). Despite being extrapolation on concepts that any fan of the Coen brothers is now familiar with, A Serious Man feels like the most personal film the brothers have made. The personal aspect comes from the setting of suburban Minnesota during the '60s, and the Jewish tradition and folklore inundating the film's entire mise-en-scene. The character Larry Gropnik is played with a simple, deadpan aplomb by theatre actor Stuhlbarg, and Joel and Ethan Coen's humanistic handling of familiar concepts in their standard dark comedy format make A Serious Man their most mature film yet.Marc TodoroffOctober 2009",A Serious Man

296,nick-1168,"Bring back the Coen brothers we love, please!",5,24 August 2010,"Never judge a blu ray by it's cover... a rule to remember. I was quite surprised to see a Coen brothers movie release had slipped past me unnoticed, I'm a fan and would normally have been preparing for months. So, it was with a mixture of joy and expectation I discovered this one sitting on the shelves of our local blu ray emporium one evening.The cover boasted quotes from the press including the likes of 'Their funniest movie ever', 'Best Coen Brothers Movie ever', etc. I was ready to witness the continuing brilliance of the brothers Coen and made my way home clutching a copy, eager to sit back and enjoy another outstanding contribution to film from two great filmmakers.Unfortunately, this is not what I got. One reviewer points out that the Coen brothers are selfishly noncommercial and make movies for themselves and not ugly box office success. Well, I'm sure they enjoyed this movie - I however didn't. If you're a part of the miniscule demographic that can relate to this movie, great; you may find some fun here. If not, beware.It appears that to fully understand and appreciate this movie, check out the other reviews and postings, you have to have a pretty strong knowledge of the bible, (preferably) be Jewish and (essentially) pseudo intellectual. Tick those boxes and you'll have plenty to discuss with your friends (if you have any) during the long winter nights.Overall I give this movie a 5, due to the great way it was filmed. Sadly, the story is so alienating (read boring) for most people that it makes no real contribution in terms of entertaining, informing or inspiring. In short, a big disappointment which will likely catch many Coen brothers fans out as it did me; at least those fans used to being entertained.I sincerely hope this is not the first of a succession of 'movies for themselves' as it will likely only be the Coen brothers (and the pseudo posse) that gain any enjoyment from such works. The rest of us love them for what they do best; take a good story, tell it well, give it some edge and wrap it up in a beautiful visual package.

In the scene where his son is being called to the torah, they were singing noteyn hatorah. At the time the movie is taking place, it would have been, noseyn hatorah. The sephardic pronunciation was not adopted until many years after the time when the movie took place. Although, this is a great movie for and about Jews, I don't see non-Jews getting much out of it.

303,Chris_Rasty,"Perception, Paradoxes and Duality",8,11 January 2021,"A Serious Man on the surface is a story about a Jewish physics professor whose life, both professionally and personally, is unravelling around him, as his marriage, family and career are all in turmoil; resulting in him pondering the meaning behind it all and trying to find answers through his faith and friends. Highlighted throughout the entirety of the film is the uncertainty of his tenure, which is accompanied by his son's efforts to prepare for his own Bar Mitzvah.Under the surface, however, the film is far more complex, as it frequently explores the concepts of perception and paradoxes, while the story unfolds. Characters are often set in similar situations where the reality of the scenario is dependent on the perception of the character. Many of the hardships that the protagonist of the story, Larry, faces are unbeknownst to him, as they require an action to unveil the reality of the situation. Until an action is taken, multiple realities of the same scenario can simultaneously exist, creating a paradox.The paradox theme is immediately introduced with the opening scene of the film, as a 19th-century Eastern European husband tells his wife that he was helped by a man, whom he has invited to their home. His wife knows of the man and proclaims that he is dead, and therefore the man her husband invited must be a dybbuk (possessed spirit). The man arrives and laughs off the accusation, but she stabs an ice pick into his chest. Bleeding, he exits their home before the husband or wife, or audience, know whether or not he was truly a dybbuk. This leaves us with the paradox that the man was both a dybbuk, while also not being a dybbuk, since there was no confirmation both realities must remain true in our perception. A couple scenes later in the film, Larry is shown teaching his physics class the quantum mechanics thought experiment of ""Schrödinger's Cat"", a paradox in which two entirely different realities can simultaneously exist due to the subject's unknowingness of whether an event did or did not occur.At the beginning of the film Larry is under the impression that his marriage is a success, but in reality, his marriage is a failure. Larry quickly comes to this realization, as his wife requests a divorce to marry another man whom she has become close with. This reality was present the entire film up to this point, the only variable was the perception. His wife's paramour, Sy, had previously attempted to confront Larry regarding this reality, but was unsuccessful, resulting in the paradox that Larry's marriage is both a success and a failure, with the only variable being his own perception.Perception, paradoxes and duality are constantly present throughout the remainder of the film; the junior rabbi's perspective advice, the paradox of his student's bribe (he both accepts and denies the bribe, up till the last moments of the film where he decides to keep it), the duality of him and Sy getting into simultaneous car crashes with opposite results; the themes are constantly present as the events of the film occur. All leading to the final scene where both Larry and his son are in scenarios which could result in life or death, they are both completely safe and in incredible danger depending on the perception of the paradox that they are experiencing.A Serious Man maintains the classic Coen Brothers off-beat humor, where the quirkiness and unpredictability of everyday life is observed often in a humorous light, but also delves deep in the concepts of perception and the dramatic results of such unpredictability. Though it may not be as gripping or enthralling as other Coen Brother movies, it is one of their more abstract and cleverly written films to date.",A Serious Man
304,freelancethinkers,Major players deconstructing the film-making paradigm,5,2 December 2009,"I suppose the first thing that needs to be said is that I'm not Jewish and, as such, a lot of what was obviously a deeply personal movie went over my head, and I was left feeling like an outsider, almost a voyeur.However, perhaps as a result of this I'm able to view the film more objectively. Visually, it is beautiful. There are so many perfectly framed scenes that even when the story seems to drag it keeps you captivated.Having said that, for me, it did drag. The central figure was a neurotic, cerebral, awkward, middle aged Jewish man. Not entirely a cinematic first. Add to this the fact that he was possibly the most passive character in cinematic history - he literally made no decisions in the entire movie until the final scene. Instead he was drawn from one catastrophe to another, on the basis that he was a good, upstanding man surrounded by stronger people.Normally in this situation we would see the character challenged and grow, but this is the Coen brothers, so it's not going to be that simple. Instead,,we are left to squirm at the relentless nature of the man's incessant failings - a frustrating experience, particularly if you're not privy to the Jewish humour that pervades this intimate film.It seemed to me almost as if the Coen Brothers were seeing how far they can stretch their high profile. With No Country For Old Men they robbed us of the pivotal, climactic scene and I for one left feeling cheated. Here they simply don't introduce it at all. They break every story paradigm there is, as if to suggest that they are now so great they can present a piece that has no development, no conclusion, a prologue that seems to have no relevance to the main body of the work, and no redemptive quality to extract from any of the characters. A bit like real life I suppose. But who wants to see that on a forty foot screen?I need to lay down.",A Serious Man

306,ctp4792,Beautiful and quiet.,10,19 November 2013,"In my book, the Coen Brother's are synonymous with great films that are full of life and originality. They truly know how to write an original, interesting story with strikingly unique characters that engage the audience in their comings and goings from the beginning to the end. Every character in a Coen film has a specific place and purpose and even the minor characters are important and greatly detailed. With A Serious Man, the Coen's latest addition to their extensive catalog, this preconceived notion of greatness stands firm.""The Uncertainty Principle: It proves we can't ever really know... what's going on. So it shouldn't bother you. Not being able to figure anything out. Although, you will be responsible for this on the mid-term."" Like their other films, this is nothing short of pure talent and originality. The cast, the locations, the music, and every line are perfect. The Coen's have a knack for continuously surprising the audience with each of their new stories and this is no different. A Serious Man is loosely based on the Book of Job and for those of you unfamiliar with the Bible, Job was a dedicated follower of God and Satan saw this and claimed that Job was only obedient because he had God's protection. God then removed His shield away from Job and allowed Satan to have his way with him (though not allowing Job to be killed). Satan claimed his family, his wealth, and his personal health and still Job refused to curse God. He did question why these horrific occurrences had been bestowed upon him and his family, but he never scorned God's name and in the end, is rewarded greatly for his constant obedience and endurance. Larry Gopnik is the Coen's Job. Set in 1970, the story focuses on Larry Gopnik, a quantum physics professor at a small Midwestern university. Larry is just an average, everyday, Jewish man with a nice house, a nice family, a steady job, and much respect amongst his peers in the community. He appears to have an average yet fulfilling life. The film opens with Larry getting testing done at the doctor's office for reasons unbeknownst to the viewer and from that point on, slowly shows the disintegration of his world. Without giving away too much of the story, I want to focus on how well the Coen's told the Book of Job in their own twisted sense of humor. This film is a dark comedy but its comedic style is one that only the Coen's can create. Much of the humor displayed in A Serious Man is derived from Larry's nonchalant nature to every unfavorable event thrown his way. Throughout the course of the film his wife leaves him for another man, his job is in jeopardy, and his mental (along with his physical) health are brought in to question. Larry absorbs all of these hardships in stride and seeks the advice of three Rabbis' in a search for answers to his troubling questions. Never once does he curse God. Or does he? Larry's son orders a subscription to the Record of the Month Club from Capital Records and conveniently decides to keep that information from him. Larry starts receiving calls from Dick Dutton of Capital Records, looking for payment for the album Abraxas by Santana. Upon hearing this news, Larry states, ""I did not order Santana Abraxas, I don't want Santana Abraxas, and I won't listen to Santana Abraxas."" This is just a microscopic example of how truly brilliant the Coen Brother's are. In that simple statement of Larry claiming he doesn't want to pay for an album he didn't purchase, he scorns God. Abraxas is a Gnostic term for God so in turn, Larry is rejecting God. The Coen's litter their deep and complex stories with subtle intricacies like Abraxas and the fantastic contrast between Larry's mentality of faith and his profession. Larry is a man of strong faith yet he is a quantum physics teacher. Living blindly yet teaching mathematical fact. This confusion can also illustrate the Bible. There's a scene where Larry's student Clive comes to his office to discuss his failing grade on the midterm. Clive finds this grade to be a mistake because he understands the story of the dead cat that Larry told to the class. Larry responds with, ""You understand the dead cat? But you you can't really understand the physics without understanding the math. The math tells how it really works. That's the real thing; the stories I give you in class are just illustrative; they're like, fables, say, to help give you a picture. An imperfect model. I mean – even I don't understand the dead cat. The math is how it really works."" This can greatly illustrate how followers of the faith can become lost in the parables of the Bible and miss the real message at hand. Well done, Coen's. Well done. While A Serious Man is not going to be appreciated and adored by everyone, this unique and original take on the tale of Job is marvelous and a refreshingly great addition to the Coen's ever growing repertoire. Many critics of the film note that it just seems to end. Like the Coen's amazing No Country For Old Men, this film ends with little to no closure of the story. I watched A Serious Man with a friend and when it ended he turned to me and said, ""They didn't finish it."" But oh, how they finished it. Just like No Country For Old Men, the final shot is powerful and leaves a lasting impression long after the credits roll. It leaves us to ponder the lives of the characters and draw conclusions for ourselves and it is perfect in that aspect. Joel and Ethan Coen have long since proved themselves as impactful and powerful filmmakers and I look forward to continuously cherishing their one of a kind work.",A Serious Man

There are few very good comments on this title explaining some of the ideas in the movie in far greater detail. So I just try to make an overall abstraction. The movie tells the story about a man caught between reality and mystery. The character protagonist Larry Gopnik is a physics professor and as such he has a pretty good understanding about the world, far better then the average citizen. He has every reason to be an atheist and not to resort to mystery. However, as a Jew, living in a Jew society he was/is constantly confronted with religion (inherently bringing mystery). The movie basically reviews the complicated live of every man who tries to let this substance dualism into their rational thinking. Dualism has been extensively covered about its flaws in supporting arguments. But Larry is caught exactly in this oxymoron. Being unable to resolve this paradox on his own and not getting help by anybody, he gets deeper and deeper into the problems caused by it.Besides that, the movie is really funny!",A Serious Man
311,forkus,embrace the mystery,10,10 December 2010,"i love this film. if you had asked me if i loved it after the first viewing, i would have replied that i don't know. i didn't understand it for a few viewings, and even after 10+ viewings, i still don't understand it totally, but i embrace the mystery...there are so many levels to this film. many of the previous reviewers focused on the book of Job retelling, but i feel that is just one of many levels of this film. there are societal levels, generational levels, emotional levels, and mathematical levels, just to name a few that I've uncovered. every little scene of this movie appeals to one of the interpretations of the same story. Larry represents at once, his own mid-life self and his future son. the son, while appearing flat and devoid of substantive character, is Larry also. the first two rabbis represent Larry and son, middle age rationality and youthful wonder, and Marshak represents the wisdom of old age. even the confiscation of the radio by the teacher is a metaphor for middle age stealing the freedom of youth. the bar mitzbah scene (sorry for any misspellings, as i am not Jewish) is quite telling. the rabbi literally forces the boy to pull the cup from his hands, symbolizing how we must take from society (the generation before us) what we deserve. the boy learned the Torah and had difficulty speaking his verses, and some of the older men around him provided assistance. previously, when the boy offered assistance to the old teacher in using his radio earphones, it was dismissed, but later in the movie, Marshak recites verses of Jefferson Airplane for the boy and accepts his assistance. this signifies something about how the wise realize that youth have more to offer the world than just their stupid and repetitive nonsense. the boy went to the trouble of learning Torah, so Marshak reciprocates because he is wise enough to see the beautiful contributions of youth to society (ie. the song which in essence tells more about what is happening in the movie than the rabbis do). the middle aged rabbi is nearly worthless, as he speaks only in rational things. the youngest rabbi speaks truth, but his truth cannot appeal to the middle aged Larry, except when he is high and sees things with a new perspective.as for the beginning sequence, we must accept that evil is real and irrational. the middle aged man (who is rational) cannot accept the idea that the man who helped him is in fact evil. its irrational to think this could be possible. the scene was left open ended because we must decide for ourselves which is reality. did the wife kill a dybbuk or not? she believes that she did because she is irrational and religious. to believe in God, is essentially a leap of faith. you must forgo the rational and do what you are told is correct. Dora acts, regardless of the outcome, because she believes in the irrational. i believe she killed a dybbuk. later in the movie, Sy Ableman is the dybbuk in Larry's life and he doesn't act because he is rational. he is rational because he is middle aged and beset by tribulations, unable to deal with them as his son does (avoiding them). he must be irrational and yet he cannot.the final sequence with the tornado ties all the levels of the movie together. the son is both himself and a future Larry at once. i don't believe the tornado represents an actual impending death for him, but rather the storm of middle age that he will inherit from his father. we are left to decide if Larry will live or die, be terminally ill or just suffer further tribulations, but either way, his son will no longer be able to run away from his own tribulations. he will become his father, thus he better find somebody to love. that was what Larry needed to help him through his own perils.all in all, this movie is pure brilliance. i would suggest watching it at least 3 times and trying to see it from a different angle with each viewing. pay attention to the small story details and see the puzzle in its pieces. you can assemble A Serious Man in many different ways and find a unique commentary in each viewing. all of the meanings and symbols exist together simultaneously. its an abstract cinematic masterpiece that should not be viewed as a realist painting, but taken in for the beauty of each of its various and seemingly unrelated parts.",A Serious Man
312,virvellian,flawless.,10,5 February 2013,"The Coen brothers, also known as ""the two-headed director"" have perfected movie making, at least in the technical sense. Nobody pays as much attention to details and subtle nuances as they do. All the colors are carefully chosen, camera-work is perfect. The soundtrack consists of swell Jewish songs and that's something unique to the Hollywood movie production. The actors are outstanding, especially Michael Stuhlbarg who plays the main role of Larry Gopnik, a man who absolutely lost control of his life. In this movie, a facial expression tells more than a thousand words. Just like in Fargo, the Coen brothers have managed to craft a cool experience that relies on nuances rather than elaborate story lines. Terrible things happen to Larry Gopnik, but you can't help smiling and loving him for being so helpless and awkward. In short, if you can't appreciate subtlety and nuances (it sounds boring and pretentious, but I swear it's not, I enjoyed Freddy Got Fingered, for chrissake), you should probably skip this movie and go watch Top Gun or anything with Steven Seagall in it.",A Serious Man

Larry had many questions that could not be answered by the Rabbis or by his friends/family.The main test was whether or not Larry would succumb to the test of changing Clives grades under the bribe; 'accepting the mystery'.Everything was looking up for Clive, his son's Bar Mitzvah, his wife holding him and acknowledging that they 'did a good job', and his acceptance in his job.Then however, right at the end, Larry re-grades Clive's paper so he passes, and at that point exactly, the phone rings with his doctor telling him to come to the surgery regarding his xray (presumably not good). After that, the tornado hits his town with his son in the path (they cant open the door to the basement).

314,mardikas777,"""...then what?""",10,21 April 2010,"This is one of those movies that require more than one viewing. Plus, I am sure that it is MEANT to be interpretable in multiple ways. Some might sense in it a kind of hopelessness, maybe, or even pointlessness. Misfortune never really ends, it is one of the important elements that make this movie ""seriously"" enchanting, even insane. I find this film encouraging and inspiring. Not only because it is created with supreme sense of atmosphere, not only because of its poetic language - I find it inspiring mainly because the overwhelming misfortune in the movie had a paradoxical effect on me. It wasn't in my opinion a display of Gods wrath. The main character, Larry Gopnik, was not really guilty of anything, it was just that he was a serious man, maybe even too serious. My own interpretation of the movie lies with the quote at the beginning: ""Receive with simplicity everything that happens to you"". This point seems to be too simple for most intellectual people to comprehend. Everything that happens after the quote is a ""fable"" that illustrates the quote. From the dialogue between the Korean student and Larry: ""Clive Park: If I receive failing grade I lose my scholarship, and feel shame. I understand the physics. I understand the dead cat. Larry Gopnik: You understand the dead cat? But... you... you can't really understand the physics without understanding the math. The math tells how it really works. That's the real thing; the stories I give you in class are just illustrative; they're like, fables, say, to help give you a picture. An imperfect model. I mean - even I don't understand the dead cat. The math is how it really works.""That is a beautiful example of the mind of the professor. The imagery in the movie is, as I already said, pure poetry. It stunned me both visually and conceptually. The picture was in perfect dialogue with the message. I believe that is why ""A Serious Man"" can be both funny and serious (and therefore very enjoyable).",A Serious Man

This is because the film is underpinned by odd experiences and characters presumably from the Coens jewish background. I'm sure I missed many jokes and some of the messaging.Jewish stuff aside - the prologue sets the scene for a brilliant intriguing movie... and then I think it delivers on that promise. No spoiler but the reason I say 'I think' is because the cliff hanging ending might be a little too obvious for me... I'll leave it at that.

From Blood Simple through to No Country For Old Men, I have found their movies range from good to brilliant, but with A Serious Man, I felt like I was watching someone tell an 'in-joke', the kind of joke that every one else (the critics) are laughing at and you feel you should be to...but you just don't get it.The story of a 60's Job, Larry Gopnick, who has everything go wrong at once then finds his life going downhill from there, A Serious Man has many of the hallmarks of a Coen brothers, quirky characters, darkly comic bits and a skewed view of the foibles of life. But I kept asking myself throughout, what is all this pointing to? Like Larry, I felt that I was witnessing a great cosmic joke perpetrated by the creator (God/Coens) but I wasn't being let in on it. What's the meaning of it all? Only the Coen's can answer that.I read some reviews after, both positive and negative, hoping to shine some light on my confusion, but the positive seemed to be members of the club and the negative were confused, like me. There was no middle ground.I work in a video store and have spoken to many people about this movie, some regular 'Joes', some dyed-in-the-wool Coen brothers fans, and not a single one liked or 'got' it either.

It's incredible. A strange and trippy experience and foray into a wondrous land of human emotion. Movies in which you must see them through their complete end to grasp a complex idea are phenomenal. This is one of those movies. I admit I was really skeptical when I first started watching, but by the end, I was more than surprised at the intensely real experiences in the film. Translated to reality, there are moments in this movie filmed so stylistically as to give psychological perspectives for the viewer. I felt like I was there, in a Bar mitzvah. The way Coen Brothers make their movies is impeccable. Unbelievably idiosyncratic while immensely dramatic. This movie ending with a stunningly frightening tornado is the best part of this movie.

I later came to the silent conclusion this one would end in a way I couldn't justify to her, and felt the entire time while watching, there was indeed a bit more of an autobiographical bent to this script, than might initially meet the eye.It seemed as though the many subplots were mega-emphasized-almost as if to embellish each story as told through a child's eyes. The kids' constant cursing, their chronic disengagement with reality, the odd lens of obscurity much of the story is told through-especially the secret message etched in the goy's teeth that troubled Susskind the dentist so much.But damnit!

I hated every minute I spent watching this sad, desperate little man attempt ineffectually to wrest control of his life, and failing that, to make sense of it. I wanted to walk out, but I was transfixed by a obsessive need to know if - scene by scene - the filmmakers were going to realize the minutely painful details of this exploration of the forces of chaos and the insignificance of human attempts to deal with them. I spent the entire film writhing in agony at witnessing this terrible train-wreck of a life, yet unable to turn my eyes away. And the ending? Pure genius. Evil genius, but genius nonetheless.I hated this movie and would not consider watching it again under any circumstances. It is not that the characters and their situations lack reality.

321,darkblak,Black without the comedy,5,21 February 2010,"Okay, so you've read the long reviews here on IMDb, half of which are about physics theories and religious references. Many people seem to either idolize this film and give it a 10/10 or hate it to the bone.I tried to look for one single review that was actually written from a ""normal"" moviegoer's point of view, but didn't find any. So late as it is, here goes.The Coen Brothers' latest film is an unusual piece even for this duo. Depending on what you expect and the kind of intellect you have, you will find it to be either much better or much worse then any of their movies so far. Some people will like the the film's religious and scientific aspects and the underlying message, and will think about it and try to solve its puzzles long after the credits roll.If, on the other hand, if you are simply looking for a ""fun"" black comedy in the vein of ""The Big Lebowski"" or even ""The Devil's Crossing"", you won't find it here.The film's main characters are quite forgettable - they don't live up to most Coen characters. The actors are generally good, but their characters are not so remarkable. I couldn't really empathize with even Larry Gopnik, the protagonist - sure, he is the little man getting in unexpected trouble and wandering around the entire film cluelessly that we know and love from other Coen films, but there was just something cold about the guy that I couldn't really feel for him. Also there are only one or two little-known faces here, actors are lacking that little something, that on-screen presence that most of the Coens' actors like Jeff Bridges or John Turturro possess.The story has deeper roots indeed, but it doesn't bring much entertainment with it. Remember The Matrix? You could think and debate about its theories for months, but it was a highly entertaining film at the same time.Not trying to draw comparisons with the above mentioned though as this is a much simpler and a generally low-key film, but it seems to miss the fun part in a big way. I watched the whole movie with a straight face - I didn't find any scenes I could have even smiled at. Granted, this might depend on one's sense of humor, but this is definitely not the place to look for the hilariousness you'd expect from the Coens.All in all: if you are interested about Judaism, quantum physics, or are the kind of person who would care about the ""Schrödinger's Cat"" theory, this movie could just be for you.

However, I'm still struggling to find something I liked about this movie...I only take the time to write a review when it goes REALLY bad.It starts with an opening sequence that is left completely unexplained (circumstancially) and pretty much has nothing to do with the movie itself (I understand the link, it just doesn't contribute to anything!). And then the story starts, right away... but it never evolves, changes, intensifies or even ends.Terrible opening. Terrible storyline. Terrible closing sequence.This movie is solely and utterly depressing, not even offering a philosophical or analytical point of view regarding what's happening; it's not even a ""pictural art"" type of movie. Nothing much happens, nothing is really linked (which means nothing actually contributes to the story in a significant way), and it is unlikely that you will get attached to the characters or relate to their uninteresting situation. And if you do happen to relate, it won't make you feel better about anything.This movie doesn't achieve anything, doesn't offer a perspective (new or old) on anything, doesn't present an interesting story or psychological evolution; it failed to reach me in any way, which is practically a marvel in itself!

All I really knew about it was that it was a Coen Brothers movie which can either be hit or miss in my opinion. I thought it would be one of those movies that is really good independent type and only out in a limited amount of theaters, until Oscar gets a hold of it and everyone goes to see it and love it. Kind of like Slumdog Millionaire. Boy was I wrong! I had no idea this was such a Jewish, religious movie. Not only did I feel weird watching it, but felt very confused and bored. I actually didn't fall asleep, but I couldn't wait to get out of the theater. I was pretty much done with the movie half hour into it. There was no plot, no big movie stars, the kid cursing all the time is not funny, and it's was just simply horrible.

I do remember people and clothes, cars and buildings looking like they did in the film. The funny thing for me is that in a lot of movies, not just this film in or in other time pieces from the same era in particular, how the drug scene/culture is built up to be more prevalent than I remember. I'm not saying they aren't accurate, at least to their experience, and I am certainly not saying that I didn't lead a sheltered life. Being born into a southern Protestant family living in northern California during this time I know I grew up very sheltered. Still loved it and would recommend it anyone. As for the film itself: Life happens and it doesn't always come with easy answers and good tidings. The more things seem the same the more they have changed. What defines good in one era may not be the standard in the next. And this seems to be at least part of the dilemma facing our main character Larry Gopnik.

326,jafdc,A Serious Film,9,26 October 2009,"You may have to be a believer (Jewish or Christian) to like this film, although some secular (at least middle-aged midwestern) Jews and others may find it worthwhile for the period details. It is a modern version of the book of Job, which--of course you remember--contains a prologue in which God and Satan bet on whether Job will remain faithful and Satan then strikes down Job's flocks, children, and health; a series of speeches by three comforters with Job's responses; a speech by Elihu who is unhappy with the advice of the three comforters; the Lord himself answering Job directly out of the whirlwind ('who is this who darkens counsel by words without knowledge?'); a final submissive speech by Job ('I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye see thee, wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes'); and an epilogue in which Job receives more flocks and children (...) than he had before.The book and the film address what (Christian, at least) theologians call theodicy, or how bad things can happen in the world when God, who supposedly controls everything, is supposedly good. For nonbelievers (if you have any interest in the subject), the best way to think of this is perhaps to ask yourself whether the universe (the Creation) is on balance a good thing ('and God saw that it was good'). If so, then perhaps we somehow have an obligation to live moral lives and (as Jews and Christians think of it) to follow God's law. If not, then perhaps it's every man for himself and the Devil take the hindmost.The Coens' answer, if I understand it correctly, comes out of the whirlwind at the end in the voice of Grace Slick. I personally prefer God's original response with its paean to astrophysics and evolutionary biology--'Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? ... When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? ... Gave you wings and feathers unto the ostrich? Who leaves her eggs in the earth, and warms them in the dust, and forgets that the foot may crust them or that the wild best may break them...; because God has deprived her of wisdom, neither has he imparted to her understanding'--which essentially asserts that Creation is wonderful and a package deal. But the Coens' very different answer, while oddly Christian in emphasis, is fully consistent with both the 1960s zeitgeist and with the midwestern Jewish community that they have so meticulously recreated.If you like this film, you really need to see it twice. But without giving anything away, if you see it once, be careful to pay attention to (i) the bribe that, like Schroedinger's cat, is alive and dead at the same time and (ii) the whirlwind at the end.

328,gartkle,Preaching to the converted?,6,23 February 2010,"This is my first film review and the reason for starting here is that I have come back to re-read the reviews that led me to watch the film in the first place. As you can guess, I'm a little confused. As I write the film has a 7.5 rating out of 10 (which is pretty good) but from reading a number of the reviews it's pretty clear that the people voting it so highly are not your average Joe's but those of a Jewish faith and those who are familiar with the dead cat theory (or both). Now before some of you throw your arms up in the air, I just want to say that I may be unique in that I watched this film without any knowledge of what it was about and who wrote it (don't dwell too long on how that is possible but it is important). Only by reading these reviews again did I find out that it was to do with the Book of Job. I have no knowledge of the Jewish faith so this completely passed me by but that doesn't mean I didn't get something out the the religious scenes. ***The following contains spoilers***I watched this at home alone and half way through the film my wife came in and asked me what it was about. I had to think how I could sum it up in a few lines and this is what I said ""It's about this guy who's wife leaves him and he turns to his religion for guidance and they collectively fail to help him in any way shape or form. They each talk a lot but the words don't actually mean a great deal yet they are convinced that what they are saying is helpful."" As I finished saying this I realised that this could have been written by an atheist as it sums up the atheist view that religion is a lot of talk with very little in the way of practical help. At this point in the film the main character was desperate to see the third Rabbi and when the door opened and you saw the Rabbi sitting motionless at the far end of a dark and dusty room, I just knew what the secretary would say when she returned from speaking to him (it wasn't helpful).The message that I was getting was that the first two Rabbi's were incapable of offering any real help and the third couldn't even be bothered to speak to him...so how was this a positive reflection of the Jewish faith? It looked to me like it was saying that if you want answers, don't waste your time asking religion.As for the ending, to me it said ""some people are just unlucky"" but like religion, it's all about interpretation. If you are of a religious persuasion you can analyse it a hundred times and come up with a hundred different interpretations (which is what religion likes to do) but the bottom line is that it means whatever you want it to mean (unless 'the creator' actually decides to tell us what its supposed to mean.....something that other 'creators' might want to take on board and then we could all stop arguing who is right and who is wrong....just a thought). Conclusion, is this a film for non Jewish followers who know nothing about the Coen brothers?...probably not. Those of you that are intimately familiar with the dead cat theory and the Jewish faith might say that I have completely missed the point of the film but what I will say is, ""Is that my fault?"" There are plenty of other films that you will 'get' so you may as well give this one a miss as it is a little too 'in-house' for those outside looking in.",A Serious Man

Scene means nothing but little by itself and just create questions like 'Was the man really dead?', 'What is the significance of this scene?' but as the movie goes, this prologue gains more sense and meaning; and creates even more complicated questions: 'What is rational anyway?', 'What to do against what we don't explain?'This bleak comedy introduces us with Larry, a professor who seems to be okay with his life. He is living an ordinary life in a 60s suburb with his family and brother. And somehow everything falls apart. He starts to have problems with his gun-crazy neighbour, he finds out that his wife Judith is having an affair with a friend of his -Sy Ableman- thus wants to divorce, his foreign student blackmails him for a bribe he didn't accept, his brother gets accused of sodomy, his promotion gets uncertain. So what just happened?Fate (or just coincidences) has its own very distinct character in this film. After some point, events happening to Larry doesn't feel like simple misfortunes. It feels like through the film somebody was just tormenting Larry using that ""fate"" and of course I would give that credit to Coens for which they mentioned during an interview too. Larry consults 2 rabbis. The first rabbi advises nothing but a new perspective to look at parking lots (which gives nothing); but the second rabbi tells a very interesting story about a Jewish dentist. Dentist experiences an unexplainable incident which led him to question reality and fate; and when he comes to see the rabbi, advice he gets is to move on and then the questions will eventually go away like a toothache. Does that remind you of something? Remember the quote from Rashi in the beginning: ""Receive with simplicity everything that happens to you."" Coens actually give the advice before the prologue. Things get normal for the dentists but not for Larry, even when he accepts to 'receive with simplicity' more will be coming for him. Coens bend reality by making these incidents happen in the story and when things slowly gets back on the trail, they just bend reality again. So what we have on our hands as Larry's life? A loose train maybe.The incidents makes us give up on our faith in natural way of working of things (if such thing really exists). Which is really strange because our main protagonist relies everything on what is natural. He tries everything to keep his life ordinary, he works as a physics professor; he might be the only rational man in the film. Then everything he counts on is taken away from him even physics and rationality.There are lot to question in the film. Sy Ableman always shows an unreasonable sympathy to Larry. Ableman and Larry had simultaneous car crashes; Ableman died, Larry lived. How did Larry lived through a car crash in the midst of all those misfortunes? We don't have an explanation for this coincidence. Then I remember the classroom scene in which we see Larry explaining Schrodinger's Cat. An experiment that puts a flask of poison and a cat in a box, it is about whether the flask breaks and kills the cat or doesn't. That creates a scenario that cat can be simultaneously both dead and alive, an uncertainty. We see that uncertainty in the crash scene, both Larry and Ableman could be dead or alive, Larry was the lucky one. Then I look for a reason; why wasn't Larry the one that died? Apparently, It is just because. About this film, I can just say that it was coincidence. I could stop questioning because I would just 'received with simplicity' all the events by leaving the uncertainty outside.Now I think I can get something from that prologue. Old man could be a dybbuk or a normal human being; the important thing is not what he is, it is the uncertainty. Velvel approaches the man with caution as he isn't sure what he is, and tries to understand the situation (something only Larry would do in the main storyline) while Dora is sure about what he is despite the fact that she is seeing him in flesh and knows that the right thing to do is to get rid of him. After Dora stabs the man in the chest, man asks Velvel: ""As a rational man: Which of us is possessed?"" The one allegedly is a dybbuk or the one that stabs someone without knowing anything for sure, which one? The man may be possessed by a demon but Dora is possessed by simplicity; she is obviously not able to question, nothing is a mystery for her and she just leaves the uncertainty outside. Rabbi Nachtner would put it like: ""Was the man a dybbuk? We don't know. Did he succumb to his wounds? We don't know. Moving on? Wouldn't hurt.""",A Serious Man

335,wilderliddle,"Oddly darker than Fargo, although not as good.",10,25 November 2017,"A Serious Man has a quirky feel with dark undertones much like Fargo. Both mid West, A Serious Man takes its character from the more urban, yet similarly bleak suburbs of 1960's Minnesota, and the exaggerated Jewishness of the characters. A clear palette of oranges and browns, this film feels about as Coen as you can get. The entire film carries this sinister sense of a soulless suburban life, while also playing on complex themes of Yiddish folklore.It opens with this horror like 1800's Eastern European scene of a Jewish man inviting a supposed dybbuk into his household. The questioning of paranormal devil like themes so early on sets the film up to be that of impending peril. The entire film essentially focuses on the continual failings and misfortune of Larry Gopnik, a physics professor with a failing marriage. Much like Fargo, the similarly terrible events juxtapose the almost innocence of the characters, as we watch Gopnik's world fall apart, the whole interactions of the characters are just so mundane. This creates that typical Coen black comedic effect. Much like Fargo's Steve Buscemi, calmly explaining how he will ""have to, you know shoot you"", Larry is easily let down time and time again by other characters, to the extent where it appears almost funny.",A Serious Man
336,masood-abdollahi,"Hashem, why have you forsaken me?",9,26 May 2014,"""A Serious Man"" opens up with a plainly profound quotation which is quite a concise version of the motion picture ""receive with simplicity everything that happens to you""; and along with it, if there's ever a word to describe the film it would be Fatalism. A fatalistic perspective with a propensity toward damnation rather than salvation, with Lawrence Gopnik to be in the center as a log bobbing about on the choppy water. As the story unravels, a sense of uneasiness and overshadowing pervades throughout the film in every aspect of Larry's life which spreads gradually throughout their community and culminates in tornado and the last call scenes provoking in mind the final premonition which should be felt by the audience which allegorically speaking might not be so out of place to name it an allusion to the Judgment Day. The consideration of ""A Serious Man"" as a mediocre movie would be dismissed as an absurdity and folly. The movie succeeds in its integration of comedy and drama which is hard to believe to be surpassed by any other black comedy since it defines the elements so subtly and at the same time so blatantly that we feel the scenes to be funny, but our inability to laugh at them chokes us bitterly because we feel the familiarity of the tragedy in Larry's life. One of the Highlights of Larry's points is his confusion and bafflement. This characteristic is so evident in his complexion which would be impossible to go by unnoticed let alone in his speech and his recurrent sentence that: ""I haven't done anything"". Larry, the wizard of logic, whose virtuoso ironically is head and shoulders above any equation's proof, is perplexed in apprehension of his daily and simple doom. His life is a proof to the negation of the old adage and revises it that: ""when a door slams another one slams harder"".",A Serious Man

343,mikechung,When the Truth is Found to be Lies...,8,26 March 2010,"I have learned a lot about Schrödinger's Cat and the trials of Job, mostly from reading some excellent reviews of ""A Serious Man"" here in IMDb. I still think the magical mystery moment in the movie occurred when Danny goes to meet Marshak.The Rabbi is truly a sage, giving up interaction with adults and meeting only with Bar Mitzvah celebrants. The adults are already too preoccupied with everyday life, and their insistence on knowing the ""reasons"" behind every event that happens in their lives is tiring. Thirteen-year-olds, on the other hand, are more open-minded and still approach life with a measure of wonder. Marshak is also able to empathize with youth, getting down to Danny's level and reciting the lyrics and the names of the Airplane. Then, in a moment that summarizes the movie, Marshak hands back the portable radio that was confiscated from Danny, and tells him to ""be a good boy."" The radio was an instrument by which Danny had done wrong, yet Marshak returns it to Danny with an admonition to be good. It says that we clearly have the potential to do both good and bad, and the choice is entirely up to us.One thing though, being of Asian descend, I was uncomfortable with the portrayal of Clive and his father. Visions of Marge Gunderson's Japanese friend in ""Fargo"" come to mind. In that movie, that segment did not contribute anything to the movie, it felt like a deliberate dig at the Japanese. The movie would have been better without the Japanese character in it.Here in ""A Serious Man,"" the images of the Korean student and his father were at first negative, and that would be it if you do not take into account the play on Schrödinger's Cat. In the quantum superposition of things, whether Clive left the money or not, whether it will be a passing grade or a defamation suit, those are all the possible states of the given affair. Another reviewer says that the Korean father and son are masters of the paradox, and use it to further befuddle Larry. Taken in that light, the Koreans characters were far less capricious than the Japanese in ""Fargo."" All in all, I was surprised that ""A Serious Man"" is such a morality tale, that Hasham can be so precise and unforgiving and all wrong-doers were stricken down without mercy. If that were indeed the case, the world would be a more peaceful and safer place. This observation aside, I still think ""A Serious Man"" is a great movie. It filled me with excitement and wonder when I first saw it, and I was just thinking too much on subsequent viewings. The junior Rabbi was right after all.",A Serious Man

345,askterix2007,More than a Coen movie: a masterpiece,10,23 February 2010,"A strong characteristic of a masterpiece is that we find out something else each time we look at it. It is the case of A Serious Man.The prologue, for example, is a strong, beautiful and short tale that we could even believe in the disguising answer (""it has nothing to do with the main story"") given by one of the Coen. But each time we rethink on it we get a different interpretation, all of them coherent with a certain aspect of Larry's course in the film. Coen Brothers are simply genius. One can compare the protagonist Larry with Barton Fink, a good man that was brought into a nightmare by his own feeble behavior to deal with others. Sy Ableman's scenes with Larry to force him to leave his wife and his house are a superb example of unctuous behavior to cheat someone. The Jewish dialogs, jokes and faces, mainly the teachers and rabbis, were very well seasoned and seemed honest and not derogative. A good example is Larry's son, most interested in marijuana smoking, that pleases everyone for just memorizing his Bar Mitzvah Torah reading and doing it perfectly, even with a stoned out face. A Korean student, on his turn, put Larry in front of his own ""Schroedinger's Cat"" (yes, it is worth it to know what is it before going to the theater), showing that Mathematics is really not needed to get the meaning, contrary to Larry, that relies in Mathematics but never get the meaning, and run after rabbis to help him to understand his plagues. It came from the Korean father to an intrigued Larry the main lesson of the film: ""accept the mystery"". This lesson combines with the dybbuk dilemma of the prologue, with the unknown origin of the Hebrew letters found behind the teeth of a non-Jewish, and the same could be said about some others scenes. You can expect a legitimate Coen Brothers production, but this time is even more than it, and I am sure I will watch A Serious Man some more times to get some new insights and get more pleasure from this unique movie.",A Serious Man

Once you review something you define it, and this story of loss, tragedy and cruelty, is far beyond any simple words; falling it into the category of artistic truth. In defining this film, one could say it is about wrongs things, tragic occurrences, happening to Larry-Gopnik (the protagonist). It emphasizes, surely, what kinds of unlucky events can occur to anyone: a divorce, caused by a stale relationship; a probing into ones actions by an authority (as expressed through the 'tenure committee' from his university, investigating some negative reviews of Larry from 'anonymous' ); or, even, a natural disaster. Given the powerful command of cinema the Coen brothers have, they can transport their audience into the life of their protagonist. You will therefore empathise with Larry, and all the disasters that beget him. What is equally mystifying and beautiful is the Coen brothers' inclusion of Larry's quest for answers. He seeks answers because he feels everything happening to him confusing. He feels lost, like a child, born again. The events which transpire are beyond his pragmatic, semantic, mathematical imagination – incapable of actually happening to him. He begins to dream. As the events unfold and luck abounds Gopnik, he himself searches for a greater power; seeking for wiser men to explain these mishaps. But as we know (although somewhat fooled by the magic power of Film -- in that we expect an answer) the answers one seeks can only be found for oneself.

This is certainly their best effort since Fargo.Admittedly this isn't a movie for everyone. There is no happy ending and there is little character arc at all. The ending doesn't resolve anything in the traditional sense -- it only emphasizes the question. Though the criticism oft repeated here that the characters are ""one dimensional"" is valid, I think it's missing the point entirely. This is a movie about ideas -- philosophical ideas -- not a character study. It's a meditation on the absurdity and lack of cause and effect in this world. The outlook is bleak. It's a subversion of the search for self and meaning.My advice for anyone watching this is echoed in the words of Clive's father who essentially presents Gopnik with a paradox.

Normally, it is on the third group that I find what I call ""the movies of my life"", meaning the movies that grow on me, making me think and, after a while, making me find myself shaping an important decision according to a lesson one of these movies made clear to me.I didn't immediately know if I liked or disliked 'Fargo' (1996), 'The Big Lebowski' (1998), 'No Country for Old Men' (2007) and, now, I was also not so sure about 'A Serious Man' (2009), the latest movie by the Coen Brothers.

The masterpiece is the biggest possible bridge between both shores, both carrying people from the known-land to the new horizon, as well as bringing them back to tell others about the new sun- photographs.Thus, it's not a question of liking or disliking new pictures of the sun, simply because we have not much to compare them with – the same way we cannot like nor dislike what we may become.But, seeing the other margin, we definitely feel disturbed: for where we are, for what we are and for the new view making us feel we should or could be something else.All the above paragraphs may seen abstract to whoever haven't watched A Serious Man.

This movie comes to you like a hammer on your firm-land known-side of the bridge; for you have been just standing there... Suddenly you must fall or run to the other side, to become something you, we, fear – but that at each scene of the movie will seem better than just doing nothing.The movie goes by Jewish tradition, but it recalls a lesson from a Hindu scripture. Arjuna, the model warrior, suddenly doesn't want to fight, doesn't want to do anything seeing the war ahead; it takes a Krishna to scold him into understanding.This movie is different form The Pianist's (2002) anti-hero of Polanski, that didn't create the genocide before it he could not do but play the sonata of his own life. It is also different from Being There (1979), where Hal Ashby directs Petter Seller's wise-naïve through non-doing his way into ruling the country – for the serious man has nothing of naïve. And it is also different from the Australian movie Bliss (1985), with Ray Lawrence directing the story of a man who decides to do something. This Coen Bros' movie is different because the man can not, does not, will not decide doing anything... Because he doesn't see why he should.The Serious Man then goes asking for advice from Three Rabbis. When watching the movie, you'll see what a serious advice he gets. The end, which I of course won't reveal, recalls the one from 'No Country For Old Men', when the sheriff by Tommy Lee Jones tells us his apocalyptic dream on Death – a Death that doesn't care about our pretensions. I present here the translated poem of the Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa (writing as Álvaro de Campos), that summarizes what I get from the movie.THE NEWTON BINOMIAL"" The Newton Binomial is as beautiful as Venus de Milo. The problem is that there are few people who notices this. (Álvaro de Campos)óóóó — óóóóóóóóó — óóóóóóóóóóóóóóó (The wind outside.) ""As the Death in No Country For Old Men, in the poem above the Wind doesn't care about the values of Álvaro de Campos. The wind doesn't care about his ghost-values. Not much cares about the seriousness of the serious man...A serious man invites to his house all his ghosts, because he rationally thinks he has to recompense them for supposedly having helped him in a moment of fear. The man doesn't think that his fear may invalidate his reasoning, despite his wife clear not so good feeling about the strange guests. When the man suddenly notices the guests are ghosts, and didn't really help him (for ghosts can't really help), the ghosts already dominated his house and are feasting on the man's expenses.Why are the ghosts behaving so badly, asks the serious man? Why, if the man didn't do anything?The Coen brothers thundering answer is ""exactly because of that"".",A Serious Man

Love the Coen Brothers, particularly 'Blood Simple', 'No Country for Old Men', 'Fargo', 'The Big Lebowski' and 'The Man Who Wasn't There'. As always, the performances were brilliant and the film is shot and directed beautifully (blah-blah etc.) but did I like it enough to recommend it? No.It was funny in that quirky 'Coen' kinda way but unlike many of their other films don't go into this expecting ""closure"" (and yes, I see the irony in that for those of you who've seen this). In my subjective opinion, the story meanders along unnecessarily for the duration and will likely leave you largely unsatisfied at its conclusion (like a 4 course meal composed of 4 similar types of soup).Is this life boiled down? Yep. Would I recommend you pay for the experience? Nope.That said, if you enjoyed 'Synecdoche, New York', you'd probably like this.",A Serious Man
363,heronblu,"Self-indulgent nonsense, and an inadequate Job.",4,12 November 2009,"The Coens seem to think they understand the Book of Job, and they want to make sure we catch on to that. ""See how we are making parallels to Job,"" the film says, and proves repeatedly that the brothers are unfaithful to–or don't understand–the allegory. Job is an exceptionally sophisticated piece of literature, but this film is a single note blared repeatedly.One might say that the Coens were obtuse for a purpose, but what was it? The protagonist, Gopnik, is depicted as such a nebbish that it is he, not God, who brings most of the misery he suffers upon himself. It is true that every one of us has our misfortunes, but Gopnik multiplies his by his inaction. (Can you really blame his wife for no longer being able to abide him or his children for treating him as a non-person?) It doesn't take an Oedipus to be a protagonist with whom I can identify, but Gopnik just isn't a tragic figure. In fact, almost the only real action he takes in the film is to finally commit an act of petty venality.An additional problem is that the brothers were trying to be a bit too clever, so that I found myself distracted by noticing that they used such ploys as showing Gopnik's fender-bender but not Ableman's (and isn't that name a wink and a nudge too much?) simultaneous fatal crash. I really don't want to think about how clever a movie is while I am watching it. I want to be involved in it! A good editor would have helped, too. What real purpose did the succubus serve, for instance? I must close with the confession that I may be missing a good deal by being a goy who doesn't know either Hebrew or Yiddish. I suspect that a good deal of symbolism, not to mention the contribution of the beautifully sung background lyrics, was uninterpretable for me, but I don't think it could turned this putz into Job. The real Job (who never suffered antisemitism, by the way, since he wasn't Jewish) was no ditherer. His character is one of the most complex and well-crafted in all of the works of humanity. To bad, brothers Coen. Next time, ignore the sycophants and bring us a Coen Brothers film.",A Serious Man
364,v_pathma,The Hindu perspective,9,15 November 2009,"This movie has so many levels of entertainment, a real movie for the masses.If you peel away the humor, the catchy scenes juxtaposed rapidly as they sedgway to another channel on the screen or your brain, you are left with the mystery. Here at this kernel, like that mysterious after taste of a deep dark wine, you ponder on the eternal question of humanity, and in particular the Jewish rendering of this question. For me of Hindu descent, the story of Job has no obvious parallel, but its Hindu to the core! The masses in India know Jobs plight very well. So it resonates deeply. Its certainly has existential overtones, of lies and absurdity, of karma and dharma. What is the right action, and our addiction to its outcome. Where is faith and why should it be disconnected from the results of your action. These are very Hindu concepts of Dharma and Karma. Its also the story of Job.So is there another layer under this onion? If we peeled off this spiritual question, do the Coen brothers have something else beneath that? I think they do, and this I think is for the modern Jewish community living today in America, but connected to their Yiddish speaking grand parents, connected to all the Jewish pogroms, right down to a possible divine order to sacrifice their only son. The scene of a Jew being shot resonates deeply. It lives embedded in a communal fear nurtured for centuries, and as holy as all other traditions. I am not saying that its an unreasonable fear, but a fear that can become unreasonable. The Hindus are disaster ridden throughout their existence, a mass of humanity subject to the whims of nature, the Jews, to being isolated as a clan, to be seen as different as they are scattered in Europe and elsewhere. And by virtue of these disadvantages they wield some power enough to cause serious whiplash by other communities who rise against them, because of fears real and imagined. It has eastern resonance with actions being neither good or bad, but just are. Up to us, to see it as God punishing us, or maybe like a fine sword forged in fire and quenched in water to become purified, nature, God or the powers that be are refining us to be that blade of truth that will not be broken by lies. This movie shows that they have a positive choice of what to do, and how to deal with it. As the young rabbi said very unconvincingly, there is another fresher way to look at things, and that is an opportunity. I think Larry kept being haunted by the darkness that carried his community through the centuries, and today in modern America, there is another opportunity. Not to pull through the next few centuries tethered together by fear and victim hood, but to see that its the human condition irrespective of anyhuman. But even so, there are no guarantees, and the rabbi say this, that at some level you bend to Hashem. I apologize if I hurt anybody's feelings in this rendition of my opinion. I am open to change, and I don't see what I say as harmful or denigrating so I hope you don't see it that way either. I do think the movie is the most successful message to a people caught in the middle of the middle east catastrophe that is enveloping all of America and a big chunk of the world, as it consumes life and hope with it. These are the dark clouds of our horizon today.Once all the other layers are shed, its this message of life, this movie has to offer us. Pathma",A Serious Man
365,grharding,By no means as good as the critics would have you believe,6,11 December 2009,"Despite the inevitable hype that accompanies the media darlings that are the Coen brothers, A Serious Man was a serious let down. The laughs in this movie were at a minimum as too was any kind of interesting storyline. The film meanders along at a leisurely pace without ever getting going. It strikes me that the Coens are a little too aware of their own success at producing dark comedies. A Serious Man lacks any of the charm that made Fargo, The Big Lebowski, O' Brother Where Art Thou? or even (shamefully) Burn After Reading so absurdly humorous. It seems that the Oscar winning directors are riding their reputation a little too much in this movie and become a little too self-indulgent. Some very ordinary central performances and a quite frankly dull storyline ensure that it lacks any of the fascination and longing for a second take that usually resonates long after watching a Coen movie.

With ''No Country For Old Men'' they tried something new and more popular, and with ''Burn After Reading'' they gave us a great comedy with an all-star cast. So everybody was expecting something good.And? And they gave us something good, but different, without any artifices. I agree it's a cold, but very well done movie. Some people will find the movie long and boring and it's understandable. However, if you're a fan of Joel and Ethan Coen, you'll be amazed by their way of directing and how they created a disturbing atmosphere through out the whole thing. In fact, it's not a boring movie, but it's a film about a boring period and a suburban. The only thing is that they tried to do a Coen film too much.They also chose to cast unknown, but talents actors and it help the ambiance of the film because you don't have a ''parti prit''.

369,talkradio-643-283022,A by the book Coen brothers classic,7,11 October 2012,"A black comedy about a man who suffers a repertoire of problems whilst his daily grind drives him slowly to the point of madness is by no means an original concept, yet the Coen brothers may have revived this indie staple of a genre with a frank and sometimes awkward viewing that we can help but stay riveted too, much like listening to neighbours fighting.The opening scene, a domestic dispute over ghosts in a snowy 17th century eastern European shack, feels like a rejected sketch from a Woody Allen plays, but ultimately sets the tone for the film well. from here we are launched full bore into one man watching his life disintegrate, while the world goes on regardless, his marriage breaking down whilst he prepares his son for his bar mitzvah. Unfortunately the film relies on stereotypes for early laughs, particularly racial stereotypes. Whilst they do draw laughs from a crowd it shows a lack of effort on the writers' part. The film can become awkward to watch in some places but still holds itself together as a comedy. It does come with a heart and like most comedies this surfaces towards the end, but clever editing is used to pepper this tension with scenes of obvious humour such as the Bar mitzvah which can crack the stoniest of faces. The emotional journey isn't left unfinished and the swimming pool scene is source for some of the best drama in the film, taken off with inspired acting and build up to one of the films true laugh out loud moments. All in all i would highly recommend A Serious Man to anyone who takes their comedy black, but with a little sugar.",A Serious Man

374,manuelamodica,Death changes everything,10,26 September 2010,"I believe critics underestimated the end of the film. The son, with whom the story starts, is always running to avoid his bully creditor, but now he can stop, he finally gets back the money he had stolen from his sister and approaches the guy to end the run. His bully creditor, though, is no longer interested, he doesn't even care, he's watching something far more interesting, a scary approaching hurricane. We watch this soon after his father's doctor call. And also here, something far scarier is approaching: death. But let's get back to the prologue: a woman despite what she sees with her eyes,trusts further more what she has been told. Let's then watch the film from this angle. The son and the father. We go through lot's of annoying – and funny - little events, all somehow against them, and therefore us. The father: his adulterous wife, his hypocrite wife's lover, his sick and desperate brother, his corrupting student, his aggressive neighbor he's even being forced to pay for something he doesn't even want: a deep individualism, in western society, like the hurricane, is approaching. The son: the teachers, the bully mate, the always complaining sister, and the Mitzvah, all sinking in his true ritual: smoking. But in the end, whatever they go through, that even bring the father to fail a serious life and embrace corruption, is pointless. Therefore the first rabbi was right – the father, in fact, sees it and says it when he's stoned – everything is nothing more than a point of view, a state of mind, a nonentity. And what we fear all the time – the dybbuk – pushes us to fear life. A life we don't really live. Death – cancer, maybe, the hurricane, certainly – is instead changing everything we've been lost in so far. And it's too late.",A Serious Man

376,SilverxLining,A Serious Man,9,9 November 2009,"What do you do when your last film was fueled by a star-studded ensemble? Casting virtually unknown actors may not be the most obvious answer, but that's exactly what Joel and Ethan Coen did in A Serious Man ¬– a brilliant move on their part. This approach exudes a certain compelling power that can be achieved only by watching unfamiliar faces. It could just as easily be you enduring the problematic events, granted that you can hold your own on screen. It's almost cruel to watch Larry Gopnik, an adorably awkward and quirky Jewish physics professor who would be a prime Woody Allen leading man, go through his downward spiral of a life, especially when all you want to do is give him a giant hug and send him in the right direction.Larry (Tony-nominated Michael Stuhlbarg) never leaves his simplistic Minnesotan suburban neighborhood without his most crucial accessory: a permanent look of confusion and helplessness. He is the epitome of Murphy's Law; anything that can go wrong will¬, and oh does it. Not only does Larry have to deal with the board's tentative decision whether to award him tenure, his wife Judith (Sari Lennick) has decided to leave him for the all-too-laid-back- and-over-touchy Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed), a ""serious man"" who is Larry's polar opposite. Oh, and he also has to put up with his brilliant but socially inept brother with a puss-filled cyst and a gambling problem, a daughter who sneaks money from his wallet and whose hair can never be clean enough, and a stoner son who is in the process of being Mitzvahed – all of which pay him absolutely no heed, unless it's to fix the antennae for ""F-Troop.""Now this sounds like the kind of thing that would make you want to pop a few Zoloft upon watching, but the Coens, like always, successfully crank out witty dialogue that makes bribery and the threat of being sued for defamation by an underachieving Korean student seem hilarious. There is certainly a degree of humor that may not relay to the non-Jewish viewer, but that does not stop this dark comedy from triggering a plethora of belly-shaking laughs. This film is classic Coen. It shares many parallels with their earlier films, namely Barton Fink and The Hudsucker Proxy, all of which feature a perpetually clueless man with innocent intentions.They stick a bit closer to home this time around, as the brothers know a great deal about being a Midwestern Jew in 1967, having grown up in suburban Minneapolis. A Serious Man has a more personal feel than any of their previous films. Some of the addressed issues are not as far fetched, causing one to wonder whether the Coens have expanded on some personal experiences. The Coens have crafted a melting pot of people with the usual bad hair cuts that often plague their characters – from the stereotypical ex-veteran neighbor and his mini-me son, to the saucy neglected Jewish housewife who neighbors him on the other side.Larry somehow misses the memo that his life is completely shifting gear. The film begins with the quote ""receive with simplicity everything that happens to you."" Larry is incapable of doing so, and spends the entire film trying to make order of entropy, as he looks to God for an answer. Like some of their earlier films, the Coens make a habit of abruptly ending some scenes, whether it's for a dramatic effect or just to rile you up. All three scenes of Larry's attempts to gain solace in a Rabbi appear to come out of nowhere with a bang, literally. It's almost as if the brothers borrowed a thing or two from ""Law and Order"", which is a big fan of dramatically introducing scenes with a black screen and white letters. Oddly, it works for these scenes because they are just as random and offer no guidance to Larry. Like his family, the Rabbis seem to zone out whenever Larry talks, leaving him as helpless as he was before their meeting. The encounter with Rabbi Nachtner (George Wyman) is perhaps the most comical. He tells Larry a story about a dentist who wastes his time searching for meaning after he finds a message written in Hebrew in a Goy's teeth. Rabbi Nachtner does not conclude the story and shows no real purpose for telling it, admitting that it is impossible to know everything. This leaves the already fed-up Larry even more frazzled and causes him to yell ""it sounds like you don't know anything!""Stuhlbarg's performance, coupled with the Coens' writing, makes you root for Larry from the start. He's the familiar naïve guy who doesn't deserve all the bad that comes to him. Larry just has a tough time accepting ""the mystery"" of life, something we've all fallen victim to. His character has the potential to sound all too pathetic, but Stuhlbarg never allows it to get to that point.The score, consisting mostly of classic rock and a recurring operatic Yiddish tune, perfectly complements the film's moods. Jefferson Airplane makes an appearance more than once, but it's their hit ""Somebody to Love"" that tactically begins and ends the film. Even the seemingly ancient and all knowing Rabbi Marshak, who only surfaces to congratulate the recently Mitzvahed, recites the opening lines to Danny Gopnik (Aaron Wolff): ""when the truth is found to be lies and the joy within you dies, don't you want somebody to love."" The effect is comedic, but also causes the viewer to wonder what the meaning is behind the Rabbi's choice of words.The Coen brothers usually end their films in an untraditional way, and this one is no different. The twisted ending will pull at some emotions and may even upset you, but it is quite a visual work that will keep you wondering. In a world where searching for a meaning is meaningless, don't you want somebody to love?",A Serious Man
