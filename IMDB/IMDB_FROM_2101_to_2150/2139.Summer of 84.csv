0,SnoopyStyle,Stranger Things + Hitchcock,7,13 September 2018,"It's 1984 Ipswich, Oregon. Even serial killers live next door to somebody. Teen boys are missing and the Cape May Slayer is on the hunt. Paper boy Davey Armstrong suspects his neighbor policeman Wayne Mackey after recognizing a kid from the milk carton. He and his friends hang out, play manhunt, and start investigating the cop next door. He has a crush on his former babysitter neighbor Nikki.This is Stranger Things crossed with Hitchcock. Stranger Things is becoming a genre of its own and this is full ST. The kids are not quite as cute. They're older and talk a lot of trash about sex. The plot does run over a couple of speed bumps. The first comes in the form of the parents. I buy the skepticism but I can't buy the lack of skepticism. I can accept them dismissing the kid. I can't accept that he has absolute faith in any policeman. It's not like he's a priest. The parents are an awkward movie trope. The last act goes through some more awkwardness. The villain's reappearance is completely expected. It needs to incorporate the walkie talkie. It also needs to keep Nikki around. It does do something unexpected. Overall, this is a fine nostalgia thriller.",Summer of 84
1,claudio_carvalho,Nostalgic and Creepy Thriller,7,3 September 2018,"The fifteen year-old Davey (Graham Verchere) lives in the suburb with his parents and spends his vacation with his friends Eats (Judah Lewis), Woody (Caleb Emery) and Faraday (Cory Gruter-Andrew). He has a crush on his neighbor and friend Nikki Kaszuba (Tiera Skovbye), who was his babysitter when he was younger. One night, while playing with his friends, Davey sees a boy in the house of his neighbor, police officer Wayne Mackey (Rich Sommer). When he learns that the boy is missing and there is a serial-killer in their neighborhood, David suspects that Mackey is the serial-killer and decides to investigate his neighbor with his friends. ""Summer of 84"" is a nostalgic and creepy thriller with many elements in common with ""Stranger Things"". The story takes place in the 80´s and there is a group of snoopy boys in a suburb that decides to investigate his neighbor. The screenplay is well constructed with a creepy and surprising plot point in the very end. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not Available",Summer of 84
2,nogodnomasters,I should have gone to Space Camp,7,23 November 2018,"Davey Armstrong (Graham Verchere) is a 15-year-old boy with a paper route in Ipswich, Oregon. He hangs out with a group of guys his age who look at adult magazines and have the hots for Nikki Kaszuba (Tiera Skovbye) Davey's former babysitter. Boys his age have been going missing in the surrounding communities. Davey suspects his neighbor Officer Mackey (Rich Sommer) is the killer and drags his group into spying on him, attempting to get evidence that isn't circumstantial.This was a fairly decent ""horror"" film, minus much of the horror. It was predictable, but that was not a bad thing. Worth a rental.Guide: F-word. No sex. Brief National Geographic nudity...which doesn't count if it is in a school library.",Summer of 84
3,kosmasp,"Back in the day, when everything was ...",9,7 December 2018,"Well here is something for all the people who always go: Everything was better way back. No not everything was better. Now the vibe of this feels like an 80s movie, coming of age, mystery and a lot of darkness. So don't expect this to be just sunshine from beginning to end. It might also not lead to where you expect it to go.It questions more or less everything you see and the curiosity of a kid. Is it a good thing, is the imagination going wild? Of course there are only two options, so saying you knew all along what the answer is, is not really something extraordinary. However, this is not so much about where it leads, but how it was made. And how good everyone is in it. This is so well shot, the script is tight and even though the journey is what matters, the ending might still have a surprise left for you ...",Summer of 84
4,BA_Harrison,Those were the days...,7,22 September 2018,"I loved the summer of '84: I was sixteen, I'd finally left school, and I had my whole future ahead of me. I wouldn't say that I loved Summer of 84, the movie - it's a little too derivative, and therefore rather predictable - but I did like it, directors François Simard, Anouk Whissell and Yoann-Karl Whissell delivering a big dollop of nostalgia and a satisfyingly large helping of suspense.With a plot reminiscent of Rear Window, The 'Burbs and Disturbia, the film sees a group of teenage boys - Tommy (Judah Lewis), Davey (Graham Verchere), Woody (Caleb Emery), and Curtis (Cory Gruter-Andrew) - staking out their neighbour Wayne Mackey (Rich Sommer), a local policeman they suspect of being a serial killer. Thinking that no-one will believe them, the boys attempt to get proof, putting themselves in serious danger.Following the success of Netflix's show Stranger Things, this ode to the '80s thankfully doesn't ram the pop culture references down our throat, preferring instead to let the ambience of the decade wash over the viewer, with a Spielbergian aesthetic (classic Spielberg, NOT Ready Player One Spielberg) and a cool synthesizer soundtrack.Although, for the most part, the action is fairly gentle, focusing heavily on the kids' friendship, and their attraction to sexy babysitter Nikki (Tiera Skovbye), the film eventually cranks up the tension (the nail-biting 'phone' scene is expertly handled), and packs one big wallop with a totally unexpected death. It's so well executed that I'm willing to forget all about how the killer manages to abduct two of the boys under the watchful gaze of the entire police force.",Summer of 84
5,BandSAboutMovies,There is promise,6,7 November 2018,"I was 12 years old in 1984. It was the year of Ghostbusters, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Terminator, Streets of Fire, This is Spinal Tap, C.H.U.D., The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension, Purple Rain, Gremlins, Night of the Comet and so many more cultural touchstones that will be endlessly watched again and again until humanity no longer has eyes.Today's culture - while offering endless platforms for experiencing it - is limited by comparison. Sure, you could argue that we're living in a golden age of television and horror movies are finally hot at the box office again, but are there many things made in 2018 that you'll feel like watching in 2052?A major reason could be that we're trapped in a loop of 1980's nostalgia. It's one thing to love the films of that era more than anything made today (I'm guilty of that), but it's quite another to make new culture that endlessly refers backward to this past decade. I get it - when I was growing up, everyone wanted it to be the 1950's again, thanks to Grease, Happy Days and Sha-Na-Na.In defense of Summer of 84, this film was made before Stranger Things and the remake of It, so you can slightly forgive its reliance on the Spielbergian kids-on-bikes trope. The filmmakers even stated in an interview that they deleted a Dungeons & Dragons scene so people didn't think they were ripping off the kids from Hawkins.This entire movie reminds me of this John Mulaney quote: ""I had no supervision when I was a kid. We were free to do what we wanted. But also, with that, no one cared about kids. I grew up before children were special. I did. Very early '80s, right before children became special. Like, I remember when milk carton kids became a thing. When they were like, ""Hey, we should start looking for some of these guys. I don't think they're just blowing off steam.""""Davey Armstrong is fifteen and starts the film by explaining how the bad stuff really happens in the suburbs. He should know - in the last decade, 13 boys have gone missing from his hometown of Ipswitch, Oregon.Sure, Davey is a believer in urban legends and conspiracy theories - just a scan of the World Wide Journal headlines in his room read ""Cannibal society in sewer system?"" a reference to C.H.U.D., ""2 years left before Haley's Comey hits Earth"" for Night of the Comet, ""Cursed fog terrorizes small town!"" for The Fog, as well as stories about Hitler clones, a conspiracy in the Vatican, a crying Virgin Mary and werewolves - but now he feels that Wayne Mackey, his police officer neighbor, is a serial killer.He talks his friends Curtis Farraday, Dale ""Woody"" Woodworth and Tommy ""Eats"" Eaton into helping him uncover whether or not Mackey is the Cape May Slayer. My major gripe with the film is that these characters aren't really people but instead archetypes of what we expect from a 1980's teen cast. We have the nerdy Curtis, the rebellious John Bender clone Eats and Woody, the token chubby friend. Perhaps the lone surprise here is that Woody and Eats haven't flip-flopped their names.You can see Davey as any manner of 1980's hero - he's the boy yearning to be a man yet still full of innocence that is struggling to find the truth. You could also see him as a giallo archetype - thanks to puberty, he has become a stranger in a strange land, ill-equipped for the investigation that he is about to undertake, surrounded by ineffective cops and red herrings, while romancing a stylish and sexy woman - his next door neighbor Nikki - who he has a past history with. The only reason I don't feel this is a giallo is that the kids drink MacReady's Whiskey (a reference to Kurt Russell's character in The Thing) instead of J&B Scotch Whiskey.Speaking of inside jokes, there are plenty of them in Summer of 84, such as a Polybius machine (see our article on Sequence Break for more on that urban legend) in the arcade, G.I. Joe walkie-talkies and a MOBAT tank, a toybox contains a Turbo Kid figure (RKSS Films also made that throwback movie) and even the Bananarama song ""Cruel Summer"" is used with the exact same framing as Daniel-San riding his bike in 1984's The Karate Kid. The kids even read Boudoir, the same fictional porn magazines from the beginning of The Goonies.Even when Mackey finds the killer, Davey won't give up. He's come too far and reason won't stop him now. After all, he's found a bloody t-shirt that matches a boy he saw in his neighbor's window. Who buys that much dirt and sodium hydroxide? And why would he have a hidden VW Bug, the same car that Ted Bundy drove?Davey finally convinces Woody and Nikki to take his dad's TV station camera into Mackey's basement, where they find a room made to look like a childhood bedroom, a dead body and a still living kidnapped boy.Here's where this movie owes so much to the giallo, with perhaps the dumbest cops this side of Stagefright: after convincing his parents and the police, which leads to Mackey's home being raided, no one places the boys in protective custody. Instead, they are easy prey for Mackey to abduct and bring to an isolated place where he hunts them down.The boys have been playing a game called Manhunt their entire lives, but the real world is much more brutal than a child's game. This is where Summer of 84 careens unsteadily from a junior giallo into a straight up slasher, with Woody's throat graphically slit open and Davey cornered in the red Bava light. Instead of killing him, Mackey tells him that he'll come back for him someday, a day that the fifteen year old may fear for the rest of his days. That's honestly the best part of the film - a chilling reminder that adults are more messed up than the dreams of any kid.As Davey returns to normalcy - or what passes for it - we retrace the paperboy route that started the film. But now, there are holes left behind - the abandoned home of one of the missing boys; his lost friendship with Curtis and Eats, who are cleaning the debris of another parental battle; and finally Mackey's home, still covered with police tape. The final moment of horror comes with an act as simple as opening the newspaper to reveal the headline: the Cape May Slayer is still at large.One of my best friends absolutely hated this movie, feeling that this was a story better told before, that there was nothing new here and no reason to care about the characters. My wife absolutely loved it, happy that a movie made in 2018 had an actual beginning, middle and end, as well as some surprises along the way. And I came out somewhere in the middle. I liked the look and feel of the film. And hey - it has a really nice logo.",Summer of 84
6,Coventry,"The 1980s called, they want their...um...never mind!",6,1 November 2018,"Hit series like ""Stranger Things"" and blockbuster films like ""It"" didn't launch the trend of retro-eighties horror, they merely just popularized the phenomenon. Clever and nostalgic horror directors have been making 80s throwbacks for almost a decade now, primarily slashers, and quite frankly I can't blame them! Everything was so much better and simpler in the 1980s, including making a scary movie. Kids were naive instead of arrogant, they hung out in the streets rather than behind their computers and life wasn't made extra complicated by stuff like the Internet or mobile phones. Kids purely relied on their imagination and instincts to experience adventures, which is the starting premise of ""Summer of 84"". The film poster and reputation are actually quite misleading, as this story isn't horror. ""Summer of 84"" is more reminiscent to decade milestones like ""The Goonies"", ""Explorers"" or ""Stand by Me""; - in other words: a light-headed and easily digestible 'coming of age' adventure with young adolescents collaborating to unravel a sinister mystery. Based on the picture of a missing child on a milk carton, the dreamy Davey Armstrong suspects that his neighbor, Mr. Mackey, is a notorious serial killer and persuades his 3 inseparable pals to unmask him. Only problem, however, Mackey is a respectable police officer and all their attempts to shadow him or dig up evidence lead nowhere. The talented directors' trio, previously responsible for the modest cult hit ""Turbo Kid"", tried very hard to pen down a compelling and suspenseful screenplay. They largely succeeded but forgot to consider pacing and the occasional moment of action. It's all very interesting, but there's nothing concrete happening until the last 10-15 minutes. The climax is decent but predictable and not nearly courageous enough. Provided that the denouement was grittier and more dauntless, ""Summer of 84"" could have been fantastic, now it's just slightly above average.",Summer of 84
7,trashgang,typical teen flick that turns into a horror,7,18 January 2020,"Okay, youth in the main lead, this is clearly using the hype of Stranger Things. The score is a bit of the same, and look at the title, 84, do I need to say more,But that's the only thing in common with the Stranger Things hype. This isn't sci-fi this is a flick made for teens but towrads the end it adds the typical scary jump moments for them but I will be honest, I did like it myself.Story is simple, kids are being killed, is the neighbour the serial killer yes or no. You can easily see were it is all going, but it's after 50 minutes that this one slowly turns into a horror taht everyone can watch. And it goes faster in the last 20 minutes, that I couldn't see coming so after all, not that bad.

City, state & federal law enforcement agencies must be dummies! Not very believable. Usual mix of different character types make up the teen squad. Usual hooks of porn mags and an attractive female as center of nerdy kid's attention; usual sneaking binocular views of her sort of undressing.

13,Thanos_Alfie,Very good...,6,30 July 2020,"""Summer of 84"" is a Mystery - Horror movie in which we watch a group of teenage friends suspecting and investigating one of their neighbors because they believe that he is a serial killer and he is connected with some missing boys.I liked this movie very much because it had an interesting plot with many plot twists that made it even more interesting, a very good direction which was made by François Simard, Anouk Whissell and Yoann-Karl Whissell, and some very good interpretations made by its cast. Regarding the direction, I have to say that they all did an excellent job because the result was very good, I also found very interesting the way they presented the characters, their problems, their fears and the connection with each other. That made us relate with these four teenage friends and felt that we are together with them in the whole adventure. Finally, I have to admit that ""Summer of 84"" reminded me of the movie ""It"" of 2017 because of some small similarities but except that I want to say that I strongly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that you will enjoy it and that you will find it very interesting.",Summer of 84
14,eddie_baggins,A solid 80's tinged teen horror,6,3 March 2019,"Marking their first feature film venture since the underground success of Turbo Kid in 2015, directing trio François Simard, Anouk Whissell and Yoann-Karl Whissell return to the 80's vibe of their apocalyptic journey with throwback horror Summer of 84, that has seemingly taken inspiration from dark Spielberg tales of old and modern day phenomenon Stranger Things to craft a low-budget effort that has dull generic moments formed around some moments of genuine brilliance.Not as instantly unique or memorable as Turbo Kid, Summer sees the trio go to darker places than they did in their breakout cult favourite with Graham Verchere's 15 year old suburban teenager Davey Armstrong and his three friends spending their summer vacation investigating the possibility of their neighborhood resident and local policeman Wayne Mackey (played creepily by Rich Sommer) being the serial killer that has been murdering young boys in the local area.It's all very 80's in set-up and in tone as the films solid synth score takes centre-stage and Davey and his posse featuring Judah Lewis's tough guy Eats, Caleb Emery's chubby and lovable Woody and Cory Gruter-Andrew's nerdy Curtis begin their sometimes amateurish and sometimes brilliant investigation of Mackey, while talking about the opposite sex, spying on the older and attractive girl next door Nikki and hanging out at the local bowling alley.The problem with Summer is that around its intriguing set-up and seriously brilliant finale (that will no doubt shock and surprise unsuspecting audiences) this 80's throwback features a lot of filler that doesn't fully gel, this includes some mediocre banter between the four friends and an almost entirely unnecessary sub-plot between Davey and Tiera Skovbye's Nikki that ends up adding nothing to the films central plot line or procedures moving forward.These type of teenage adventures that dabble in horror and intrigue work best when the quiet moments work just as well as the chills, spills and thrills but that's where Summer falls down, unable to make the most of its more character driven moments or make the most of its side players who always feel slightly underdone and underused.Final Say -A seemingly generic offering that ends up becoming something much more in its full-on final act, Summer of 84 may not have the DIY magic of Turbo Kid but it still has enough in it to ensure we eagerly await the next move of this exciting directing trio.3 camcorders out of 5",Summer of 84
15,Tweetienator,Kids on a Heroes Quest,7,8 November 2018,"I was well entertained but I wouldn't call Summer of 84 a horror movie, rather a mystery thriller with some (very few) elements of horror.

16,Ed-Shullivan,A Top 10 Drive-In Classic,9,10 June 2019,"If you want to see a very entertaining and suspenseful film, then don't miss Summer of '84. This is a suspense/mystery film about four (4) teenage boys who meet regularly in their tree house clubhouse to scan through dirty girly magazines, talk about the hottest looking neighborhood girls, and discuss conspiracy theories and serial killers that are on the loose. One evening as young Davey Armstrong (Graham Verchere) is peering out through his binoculars in his bedroom window to hopefully get a sneak peek at his former babysitter Nikki Kaszuba (Tiera Skovbye) and cute neighbor in the sequence of undressing, he scans to his other neighbor's living room window, police officer Wayne Mackey (Rich Sommer) who lives alone.What Davey sees in his neighbor's living room window is police officer Wayne Mackey talking to a teenage boy who Davey distinctly recognizes a week later appearing on the face of the milk carton he is drinking from as a ""Missing Person"". With Davey having a bit of a wild and suspicious imagination, Davey convinces his three treehouse friends to commence a spy mission and monitor his neighbor, police officer Wayne Mackey's nocturnal movements.This is a very well done adventure/mystery/suspense film that the entire family can enjoy. The teenage boys do use a few swear words intermittently and their lust for young and too inquisitive Davey's former cute babysitter Nikki Kaszuba gets their hormones going, but the gist of the film is definitely focused appropriately on determining whether or not the seemingly friendly and bachelor neighbor, and police officer, Wayne Mackey is actually a real life serial killer of teenage boys, or is it just in young Davey Armstrong's wild imagination?This is a perfect film to watch at your local Drive-In (although drive-ins are not as prevalent as they were decades ago), or conversely watch it in your basement alone, and see if the hair on your forearms does not stand straight up. I won't give away the ending but it is well done and I am sure Summer of '84 will become one of the ALL TIME horror/suspense/adventure classics for teenagers and young lovers for decades to come.A worthy 9/10 rating",Summer of 84
17,gwnightscream,Good Throwback To 80's Youth!,6,2 February 2019,"This 2018 horror mystery tells about a group of teen friends that suspect a neighborhood cop of being a serial killer. This is a good throwback to 80's youth with some tense and dramatic moments. It also has nods to films like, ""The 'Burbs,"" ""The Goonies,"" ""Fright Night,"" ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" and the TV series, ""Stranger Things."" I have to agree that the last moments of the film are kind of a letdown. The cast isn't bad, the main kid reminds me a little of Michael Cera (Superbad) and I do like the atmospheric music that has a John Carpenter and Tangerine Dream feel. I'd still check this one out if you remember growing up in the 80's or if you're into horror.",Summer of 84
18,jtindahouse,"Clever, dark and unpredictable",9,5 September 2018,"The concept of four childhood friends investigating a mystery is a very hot subject for film and television at the moment. It's been hot in the past, then it went out of vogue for a while, and now it is evidently back. 'Summer of 84' had me on the fence for the majority of the runtime about whether I was ultimately going to have enjoyed it or not. The reason for this was because the ending was going to be so crucial to its success. So did it stick the landing? It certainly did - and in a very unexpected and dark way too. Now let's get into some spoilers. The film sets itself up in quite bizarre way. Early on you find yourself saying there's no way the character of 'Wayne Mackey' could be the killer because he is far too obvious. Then at about the halfway point you start thinking to yourself that they haven't even set up any casual, unexpected side characters who could ultimately turn out to be the killer. The longer this goes on the more you realise that the killer does in fact have to be 'Mackey'. It's funny that we've gone so full-circle in cinema that having the most obvious character be the actual killer is a completely foreign experience.Then the film plays out kind of as you'd expect, until with roughly 10-15 minutes to go things just explode in a violent, memorable and highly unexpected way. It gets so much darker than I ever saw a film like this getting. Seeing a young boy have his throat slit on camera is not something I'm in any way used to. I commend the film for having the balls to go there though. So many modern films are afraid to be daring and that simple can not be said about 'Summer of 84'. I would highly recommend people see this film. It is a great watch.",Summer of 84

Teen in the titular year suspects his cop neighbor is actually a serial killer, so he and his pals try their hand at being Hardy Boys. Yeah, no adults believe them. Heck, the teen's friends barely believe him. The film is enjoyable and true to its time period (more or less), and it's a well-paced mystery...until the final 15 minutes or so, when it just falls apart. The ending is just completely out of step with the tone of the rest of the movie, which is to say it's much darker and unnecessarily so. This should have ended earlier than it did.",Summer of 84

The storyline for this is a little slow but delivered in a Stranger Things format. There's great twists and turns to get to the end but once you get there, this movie jolts forward with a good mix of intensity and gore.

23,kluseba,Coming-of-age drama turning into a thriller and concluding as a grisly horror film,10,9 October 2020,"Summer of 84 is a Canadian coming-of-age drama that slowly develops into a thriller and ends as a grisly horror movie. Even though the five lead characters are all teenagers, I would not suggest to let minors watch this film. The movie should rather appeal to young adults and might even traumatize youngsters with its shocking ending.The story revolves around four teenage friends who suspect a neighbouring police officer to be a serial killer. Davey is a curious kid with slightly awkward behaviour who believes in conspiracy theories and aliens and who has a huge crush on his childhood friends whose parents are in the process of separating and who is about to leave the seemingly idyllic smalltown for a college in the big city. Woody is his best friend who is very warm-hearted despite being particularly tall and heavy as can be witnesses when he takes care of his exhausted and often absent mother. Eats also has a few problems of his own because even though he claims to be more mature than the others and shows an obsession for sexual intercourse, his parents are constantly fighting and his stupid older brother doesn't offer much help either. Curtis is the group's voice of reason as the youngster is calm and careful and rather interested in literature and science than in girls and conspiracies. These four friends hear of the Cape May Slayer who has recently sent an anonymous letter to a local newspaper that claims responsibility for fifteen murders, including thirteen teenage boys. Davey starts suspecting neighbouring police officer Wayne Mackey when he coincidentally sees a teenage boy in his living room whose picture later appears on the back of a milk carton as a missing person. His friends are initially doubtful and reject Davey's vivid imagination but the youngster insists on investigating their neighbour. When the quartet discovers that the police officer purchases huge amounts of gardening tools, has a secret self-storage room and has a blood-stained shirt in his arbour, the four friends start to believe that they might be onto something.This movie convinces on all levels. The suburban settings suggesting a fake idyllic neighbourhood are very realistic. The clothes, music and settings bring the eighties back to life with numerous clever details. The acting performances are absolutely believable. The shift from coming-of-age over thriller to horror is perfectly fluid as the movie intensifies as the story progresses. The final twenty minutes or so feel surreal, nightmarish and menacing. The movie's conclusion might leave you speechless and offers food for thought and room for debates.Again, don't underestimate this movie because of its teenage characters and actors. This movie is creepy, intense and at times shocking as it will send shivers down your spine. Remember that even though the movie takes place in Oregon, this is actually a Canadian film and most certainly doesn't have a Hollywood ending. Even the recent film adaptation of Stephen King's It feels like a cheerful walk in the park compared to this gloomy grower. If you are looking for a sinister film with profound characters, twisted plot and unforgettable scenes, give this movie a chance and spread the word about this underrated masterpiece.",Summer of 84
24,jfgibson73,The 80's are bizzack!,6,22 September 2019,"Summer of '84 tries to recreate the feeling of watching a slasher movie from the eighties by recreating elements of the era's filmmaking. They needn't have bothered. This story has it's own identity. The setting and aesthetics don't really play into the story. Some kids are trying to solve a murder mystery; most of the movie is light and upbeat. In the last third, things turn dark. Darker than a black steer's tuccus on a moonlit prarie night. I can't think of an 80's movie that goes to the places this one does in its climax. Now, if one of the characters used a pair of moon boots to kick the slasher in the privates, then I could see it.
I midly enjoyed the movie as it I was watching it, but when it was over, I had no desire to revisit it. I will give it points for having the courage to do what most ""group of teenage boys"" movies never would, but somehow, even with a fine story and a nice 80s background, I didn't really get into it.",Summer of 84
25,s3276169,Hellish nostalgia trip.....,7,28 August 2018,"I'm actually surprised reviews of this film are not more favourable. Summer of 84 takes a ""Goonies vibe"" adventure and injects cold, hard, horror elements. The result is an uncomfortably jarring experience that abruptly strips away the friendly fuzzy 80's atmosphere that is so carefully crafted in the first two thirds of the film, replacing it with something inherently chilling and deeply disturbing. If you look closely too you will see a subtle nod to serial killer Ted Bundy who was of course, of this period. Other 80's icons include the obvious synthesiser music and political trapping, that place this film squarely in the Reagan era.Very definitely a good watch for throw back 80's horror fans that has been updated to reflect the more sophisticated tastes of contemporary viewers. 7/10 from me.",Summer of 84
26,a_chinn,Loving homage to the 1980s genre films,7,22 January 2019,"Charming and violent love letter to 1980s genre filmmaking. A group of teen boys (Eats, the fat kid, Woody, the nerdy kid, Farrady, the bad boy, and Davey, the relatable main character good kid) suspect their police officer neighbor is really a serial killer. This leads to lots of spying and talking over walkie talkies, BMX bike riding, and hanging out at arcades & tree forts. ""Summer of 84"" could easily be written off as a ""Stranger Things"" knockoff, and it is admittedly very similar, but it also feels unique in some aspects, particularly in that it's a non-supernatural horror film that's more similar to Hitchcock and De Palma than Stephen King or John Carpenter in it's 80s horror cinema love fest (both still owe a lot to Steven Spielberg). Directed by François Simard, Anouk Whissell, and Yoann-Karl Whissell (billed as RKSS), who previously made the innocent yet wildly violent ""Turbo Kid,"" another 80s love letter that paid homage to low budget Mad Max post apocalyptic ripoff films (i.e. ""Endgame,"" ""1990: The Bronx Warriors,"" ""Exterminators of the Year 3000,"" etc.). As with that film, the band Le Matos provides an excellent retro style synthesizer heavy score, although this score is much moodier than their peppy Turbo Kid score (""No Tomorrow"" is a classic song as far as I'm concerned). Overall, your affection for the 80s will determine your enjoyment of this film. Minus that nostalgia value, the film is not scary or suspenseful enough to be memorable on its own. Also, the characters are not as funny or as endearing in a Spielbergian sense to be all that memorable, which is something ""Stranger Things"" does exceptionally well. FUN FACT! Look fast for the fictional Polybius video game in the arcade scene. Also look fast for a Turbo Kid action figure in the main character's closet when he's digging for his G.I. Joe walkie talkies.",Summer of 84
27,robertemerald,"Not as tense or interesting as Stranger Things, but high standard of production",7,16 February 2020,"If you really, really like shows such as Stranger Things (2016) or Super 8 (2011), which feature bands of intrepid junior teens, or a movies such as Disturbia (2007) or I Am Not A Serial Killer (2016), which feature suspicion of a neighbour, then you'll be in familiar ground here with Summer of 84. 84 features a beautiful Tangerine Dream like soundtrack. It's brilliantly acted by all, well cast, and features a far better than average script with very likeable characters. Alas, it is definitely unoriginal given those references above, although the production, which is very competent, makes up for that. It is exciting to a degree here and there, but for the most part it's not got a lot of tension about it, and save for the last couple of chapters it is definitely a PG rating. I found it hard to get through, so much so that by the end I thought it really predictable and was disappointed. It's the sort of movie where you appreciate all the great effort put in by the filmmakers, and hope that there next effort is faster paced and braver in terms of danger levels and shock value, the sorts of things that made the references above such a delight.",Summer of 84
28,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Summer of 84,6,3 September 2018,"Four horny, masturbatory teenagers who swipe whiskey for a sipping delight and ride their bikes around town to Bananarama's ""Cruel Summer"", try to prove that an overly nice, neighboring cop is a serial killer. That's the rub of Summer of 84, a build-up vehicle that's so Hitchcockian, so forestry suburbia-like, and so slow burn, it almost replicates the master himself. On a side note, I was ten years old during the dog days of 1984. My only exciting highlight was going to see Ghostbusters with my immature buds via a pizza and Pepsi b-day. In veracity, ""84"" teases as true story fodder but yeah, it's cut from original cloth. I'm no film historian or adolescent conspiracy theorist but I can see why. Anyway, ""84"" is a movie set in the mid-1980's within the state of Oregon (you'll know that right off the bat). Its sense of time and place is half-arsed but it's more about the musical soundtrack, a mixture of early John Carpenter, 1983's Risky Business, and 80's synthesizer-style cheese. Listening to Summer of 84's background noise made me want to put on my Members Only jacket, play a little Pac-Man, and grow a mullet. Also, ""84's"" title card sort of reminded me of Michael Jackson's heavily iconic, ""Thriller"" music video.Helmed by three people (Francois Simard, Anouk Whissell, Yoann-Karl Whissell) and devoid of opportunistic, heightened suspense, Summer of 84's direction is still solid. It's full of zoom shots, mildly tight scripting, slight nostalgia, Spielberg references, and Carpenter-esque jolts. However, the flick reeks of predictability (you clearly know who the quiet murderer is early on) and presents a conclusion that feels like a dangling loose end. The filmmakers fashion ""84"" as a foul-mouthed Super 8 with It overtones, obliged coming-of-age residue, and acting that projects as poor man's Stand by Me. I was somewhat intrigued and furled along but I'm going with a mixed rating.",Summer of 84
29,jellopuke,Takes a large tonal shift at the end,7,11 November 2018,"What you had here was a Goonies/Monster Squad/Stranger Things vibe for much of the movie (kids investigation a mystery) then a big change in the last ten minutes to outright horror. I'm not convinced it was necessary to the story to do that, and it's jarring as you watch it.
The other issue was the total lack of parents, which I know was a trope from the era, but here it is played too far, having parents leave kids alone during circumstances that no parent would ever do so, which made some elements hard to swallow.
Overall a decent movie, not as good as Turbo Kid, but quite watchable nonetheless.",Summer of 84

With the help of his buddies, they begin to surveil the man.I ended up really enjoying this. Creepy neighbors are always good material for a thriller. No one wants weirdos living next to them. While this is meant to be a thriller, let me just say that I was really feeling a bit of ""The Burb's"" (1989) from time to time with this film. I read a review that stated that this was like ""Disturbia"" (2007) and I can see that. Just mix a bit of goofy from ""The Burb's"" and some of the suspense from ""Disturbia"" and you'll find this movie.So glad I took a chance and checked it out.",Summer of 84

There are lots of music cues, posters, references, grainy shots and of course an extensive synthesizer music score.The story is not particularly new, think Burbs, Disturbia or Rear Window, but works well enough.The script is a little heavy-handed. Some of the references are clunky especially concerning the main characters' move through adolescence - yes teenage boys like to masturbate - we get it!It felt a little long to me and I didn't find the characters particularly endearing.

Indeed do , so creepy...Someone said there is a twist so I was expecting the complete opposite of where the storyline was taking me, but I never understood why or what the hell people meant when they said it was or is a twist ending...I was pretty dang good considering it layed it all up on the table for the viewer to enjoy and it works well... like I said if you can handle something like this than its worth the 145 - its cool, otherwise rent the Goonies, or Gremlins or something else from the 80's cause this, although based on and in the 80's - is way more innovative than most of the crap that the cheesy decade puked out , pure narliness , totally radical! lol...",Summer of 84

It should of ended when the boys go to sleep after proving their neighbor the killer. I felt it got cheezy and took a feel good movie into a disturbing one. It would have ended just fine without the extra 30 min of horror thrown in. Or a better ending would of been him waking and it was a dream which I thought would happen since there was an APB out on him ad I feel it made it silly and it was unneeded to make the film just as good. but that's my view.

41,LloydBayer,Summer of 84 offers nostalgia as the blue pill and horror film as the red pill. You can only digest one.,6,1 November 2018,"They say real outdoor fun ended with the 80s kid. Not just in the literal sense, but anything outside the confines of home - hours at the gaming arcade, playing neighborhood watch on bicycles, skipping school to be with a sick buddy, widely made-up conspiracy theories, and an endless list of everything typical of adolescence before the modern internet boom. Summer of 84 begins with a familiar kinship to the 80s, a story of four teenage boys desperate to prove that each is more man than boy. Even their names, Davey, Tommy, Woody, and Curtis seem cut out of the 80s cinema era from The Goonies to Stand by Me to the recent and hugely popular TV series Stranger Things. Throw in synthesized retro music, rebellious hip-hop fashion, a mere mention of Reagan and Bush Sr. and the film starts to conjure nostalgia specific to that period. Easier said than done? The real proof of the pudding is in actually tasting it. And here's where the film runs into a fundamental problem - a setup so big that it loses sight of the little details that goes into its own foundation.Taking cues from films like Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window, which by itself spawned a generation of suspense driven thrillers from Fright Night to Disturbia, the premise here isn't new but the crux of the film is in the opening line that ""Even serial killers live next door to somebody"". That's protagonist Davey Armstrong's theory, amongst several others plastered across his bedroom wall. As the neighborhood newspaper delivery boy, Davey (Graham Verchere) is also privy to tabloid headlines before everyone else. When news of a second teenage boy goes missing, Davey is obsessed with finding the killer. Together with his buddies and armed with walkie-talkies, flashlights and a trusty pair of binoculars, Davey sets out to prove that his neighbor, police officer Mr. Mackey, is the serial killer.Aesthetically, Summer of 84 will please every adult viewer who grew up in the titular era, and is bound to find something relatable in this film. Be it the music, the pop culture of the time or when opinions were in good faith and not obscured by the so called 'politically correct' atmosphere of modern society. But as a thriller, the story is only half as believable. Peppered with holes, the story also has us wired into believing that Davey and his friends have everything figured out, while precious little is done to make us care if they live or die. Then there's the problem with length. As much as fifty minutes goes by before we get the first and forced jump scare. The remaining fifty minutes is when things get interesting, of which the high point is when Mr. Mackey makes a house call. It's a well-played out scene and perhaps the most chilling moment in the film. Ultimately, the film ends up with a forked conclusion - one is the twist and one is the actual ending. Only one of these is successful in leaving a strong afterthought - and maybe, just maybe, the birth of a new serial killer in horror films.",Summer of 84

An easy recommendation for people who like this sort of movie. Thanks Jay (Susan) from RLM. -- (minor) SPOILERS -- 
 ---------------------------If you've seen the movie The Burbs, you might find the plot a tad similar, if not the same. Aside from the difference in tone (lack of comedy and ""brightness"") the story unfolds exactly the same, except for the ending, which in my opinion, is what makes this movie great! I usually find something to complain, even small details and character decisions, but I can accept everything that happened in it. I was specially surprised at Caleb Emery for his portrayal of Woody, which is a very ""soft"" and like-able friend, and his delivery of some lines made me like him myself.

45,gustheaffen,Watchable but hardly great,3,24 February 2019,Playing Bananarama and leaving out cell phones doesn't make a movie about the 80s. This was a long movie and it was rather boring.

Still it's awesome. The cinematography is very well done, the music is highly addictive and completely in the context (it looks like a genesis videogame music) and you can see different depths of character from the four boys - which are the characters you will pretty much care about.This is more a thriller movie that slowly burns than an entry in the horror genre. The problem i have with the end is somehow the predictability and the fact that probably a serial killer wouldn't things to end like they did. Letting the kid live? I don't know. They opened space for a sequel, but 1 - i have no idea if they will have money for that and 2 - it had to be very different even in the time frame it would be settled. Maybe a young guy listening to grunge now?Anyways, the ending might be a little controversial because of the options they chose, but all in all is a cool movie with a great 80's vibe that has parts where you get scared because of the slow pace they chose for the film.

A mystery movie based in, you guessed it, 1984, in a small suburb in anywhere USA, only thing this one has a serial killer on the loose. Luckily, the local paperboy, Davey, is into true crime and along with his group of friends believe they can track down the true killer... a neighbor of course, but is it true? Filled with 80's sounding synthesizers, it was a cool throw back type movie, and yes, of course it includes the hot babysitter next door that used to babysit our hero, and yes she's about to check out of this small town soon, and of course she's gonna give our hero hope of touching her girl parts, however... well.

This is where things start to pick up again but, be warned, it's a series of events you've seen in every mister- can't and mouse thriller.However, Credit where it is due. The acting is pretty solid throughout, I enjoyed the 80s feel (even though it felt a little forced) and the characters we very well flashed out and it was well paced.This is a film you should watch when you're lookong to just switch off for a while and take in a story, don't expect anything new or innovative, it is pretty basic but Still enjoyable in its own way.",Summer of 84
53,scb_coldsteel,A pleasant surprise all-around,8,1 October 2018,"So I watched Summer of 84 at the theater last night. I was looking forward to the movie as I was a fan of the directors last film Turbo Kid. Overall it was a fun nostalgia rich mystery thriller that left me entertained.The plot of the movie is pure 80s nostalgia. A string of murders occurs in a quiet neighborhood and it's up to the local teens to solve the muder while investigating their mysterious neighbor. The movie plays a bit like Goonies meets The Burbs. Which means it is overall a pretty fun watch.The movies biggest strength is the supporting cast of teens. They all do a convincing job and really feel like they are a real group of teen boys. Their interactions and jokes really worked well for establishing the dark fairy tale like atmosphere of the movie.On the other side of the film is a dark and violent murder mystery. The film spells out who the suspected killer is right away and slowly expands as the kids gained evidence of the murders. I do wish the film had fit in a bit more elements of horror as there really is one or two scares in the whole film.The film was a bit overly long for the subject matter and could have sped up the conclusion by omitting a unnecessary love interest. That being said I had fun with the movie. It provided a nice combination of laughs, fun, and chills. A 8 out of 10.",Summer of 84
54,Otkon,I liked it.,7,28 August 2018,"Being a child of the 80's, I thoroughly enjoyed this cute little serial killer film. The acting is top notch. None of the young actors are irritating.

55,manuelasaez,One of the best coming of age mysteries I ahve seen in along time...that ENDING!!!!,9,27 August 2018,"So, a lot of people are comparing this movie to Stranger Things, but they are wrong in almost every regard. While Stranger Thing is a sci-fi adventure rooted in fantasy and unrealistic fiction, this film is as realistic as any news story. It seems like the comparisons come from the 80's soundtrack and the fact that it was 4 young boys on an adventure, but that's where the similarities end. This movie is more along the lines of films like The Goonies or Stand by Me; movies about young men who are taught harsh things about life at an early and fragile age. While Stranger Things was for children, this movie is clearly aimed at a much more mature and discerning audience.The first two act of this film are pretty straight forward and standard; 4 young and immature boys suspect their neighbor of being a serial killer. They break into his house, dig up his garden, ect. in order to find proof of his horrifying acts. But nothing really comes of it, at least nothing concrete. The movie is funny, suspenseful and entertaining, and it reminds you of the kids mysteries that were all the rage in the late 80's.Then, in the final act, the film suddenly makes an 180 and it becomes a serious film with real horror, real stakes and real consequences. Just like real life, the story doesn't end just because you hope it does. Good people are often the victims of their good intentions, and this movie proves it.While the first half of the movie is just an enjoyable coming of age film, the second half is what really sets this movie apart. It's endings like these that make a movie really shine, and separates the audience that always wants a happy ending versus the ones that want a better, more realistic one.Stop judging this movie based on a trailer. It's wrong and idiotic. A movie should be judged on its entire running time, and this movie deserves nothing but the highest praise. Everyone involved should be proud of their work. Amazing.",Summer of 84
56,MinistryofDoom,Disturbia '84,6,27 September 2018,"We've seen this film before; it's called DISTURBIA. It's nearly identical to the plot of Disturbia, except that it was set in the 1980s: kid suspects neighbor of being a serial killer, kid recruits his friends to help him stakeout his neighbor, meanwhile kid falls in love with girl next door and she joins him in his mission. Yeah, like I said...it's Disturbia. Don't get me wrong, I'm a sucker for 80s nostalgia, and so I wanted to love this film but aside from the fashion and set pieces, it's VERY light on 80s nostalgia. You only get to here one 80s song: Bananarama's ""Cruel Summer"". How appropriate. The rest of the film is set over a well constructed atmospheric score that sounds similar to the score of Stranger Things (The Netflix series which successfully pays homage to 80s thrillers). The plot is a slow-drip thriller which far too long to actually get anywhere and by the time it does, you'll groan at the boring and unimpressive climax.",Summer of 84

58,Spartan_1_1_7,A pleasant surprise.,8,20 September 2018,"Summer of '84 is a drama mystery thriller and is about a group of kids in their mid-teens in a suburban setting in the 80s (as the title suggests) where they start to suspect that one of their neighbors might be a serial killer. Now, I didn't know anything about the movie. I just saw some good reviews and it looked like it will have a heavy dose of 80s Nostalgia+gave me Stranger Things vibes, so I gave it a shot.The story is nothing new. And the movie definitely has cliches that come with stories like these. But at the same time, the execution of the story and how it ends not only surprised me but also made me have a great time pretty much throughout. It reminded me a lot of movies like Disturbia, and also Stranger Things as I thought it would. It's a mix of elements from the two giving you a heavy dose of 80s Nostalgia which I appreciated a lot.The acting was great. The main four teens, in particular, did an awesome job. You could actually feel they are best buds and I liked seeing them work together. I also liked the moments between Nikki and Davey (the main couple you could say). They were sweet.I loved how the movie felt very grounded pretty much throughout. It's not something like The Babysitter where Juda Lewis (one of the main teens) performed in too, dude is great in both btw. It feels grounded because the story is simple and the movie doesn't try to make you suspend your disbelief all that much. Instead, the movie uses great cinematography and AWESOME music to elevate the scenes it has and it constantly keeps you interested by keeping you in a state of doubt for most of the movie. And on top of that still manages to surprise you in the final act.From the very first scene, I was in love with the soundtrack. The movie goes all in with Synthwave and it was just magnificent. And the movie utilizes it properly all the time. You see, the movie takes a lot of time setting up the story and creating tension. So much so that it's pretty much a slow burn in a way but one that is done right. Even small scenes or mundane stuff feels better when shot properly and accompanied by great music. And because of that, there was this constant vibe that, if like me, you love about these movies, you'll usually end up having a good time.The movie wasn't perfect, though. Some of the writing was weak, a plot point or two were just stupid. And I wish the final act didn't felt like it was somewhat rushed. I loved how the main story was resolved but it also felt like the movie ends a bit too quickly after that.All in all, this was a pleasant surprise. I wanted a good 80s nostalgia movie and this movie gave me just that plus more. It was fun, it was shocking and tense at times, and it was just plain entertaining. If this is your kind of stuff, I'd recommend giving this a shot.And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a solid 8/10.",Summer of 84
59,Condemned-Soul,"Fuelled by a killer soundtrack and 80s nostalgia, this is a fun mystery thriller, albeit with a slightly disappointing final act",7,27 June 2020,"In a typical, pleasant-looking suburban town, young conspiracy theorist Davey Armstrong and his friends begin to investigate a neighbour who he believes to be a serial killer...It's important to have a likeable cast when the majority of the film is spent with them in the frame, and this 80s throwback is no exception. They represent your quintessential teens who have nothing but girls and games on their mind, engaging in the usual playful and crude banter. But there's also good chemistry that makes you support their cause and feel angst when they're in peril.Riding on a wave of nostalgia will only get you so far, and so it's no surprise that eventually that wave breaks. The mystery is engaging for the first two acts, but it's a film that might not hold up so well on repeat viewings once the answers are known. The ending is more subversive than you might expect, to its credit, but it also feels slightly underwhelming. There's a lot of build-up, and you can't help but think the film would have benefited by really embracing its setup to provide more substantial thrills.Thankfully the story is backed by a terrific synth score and the cinematography and editing is worthy of praise, which overall makes 'Summer of 84' a solid effort that is just shy of greatness.7/10",Summer of 84

It builds well at the start and the interest is there mostly because of the comradery between the friends which was genuine throughout the film and really the saving grace. However it starts meandering with a dull unexciting dragging plot and when the payoff finally comes, its extremely anticlimactic. There is absolutely no mystery or suspense in this film which was a huge letdown considering thats what it was going for. Overall a decently shot film with some solid acting from the kids, but a very boring story that everyone has seen before. I will give it some credit for its visceral imagery that was unexpected, though it couldve been spread out better in more forboding fashion.",Summer of 84

64,WisdomsHammer,"Oh man, so close. But the story doesn't give us what we want, and the pacing is a little slow.",6,25 July 2021,"I liked this movie a lot. I found it suspenseful and I loved the characters. It did feel like it was a Summer of '84 story, for sure, with elements of Stephen King, John Hughes, Spielberg, and more.If I were to really oversimplify and describe this to someone I would call it The Goonies but instead of looking for One Eyed Willy and his treasure they're looking for a serial killer and it's a lot darker.Now that I'm writing this, I'm thinking of Super 8. This movie was basically Super 8 with a serial killer instead of an alien and without the great character development and story that movie had. But it's so close!I found the movie to be so slow in spots that I just gave in and fast forwarded through the slow tiptoeing through the scene to get to the point. There was a lot of good suspense in this but there was also a little bit of tedium and just plain waiting for the scene to get to the point already.Predictable? Maybe. But you never really know until you do. I still found the reveals rewarding.Unfortunately, I didn't find the ending rewarding, and that's where I get into spoiler territory, but I'll try not to completely give things away here.This is not a feel-good story like The Goonies or a Spielberg or John Hughes movie. The boy doesn't get the girl, and the bad guy gets away. We go to movies to escape that reality. We want the bad guys to get caught and we want to see the boy get the girl and all his friends and his family to live happily ever after. At least, I do. But that's me.

So maybe this is a knockoff but I don't know my review is solely based on this movie.This movie is brilliant. The first thing I love is the 80s feel. It doesn't feel contrived. It feels like a group of kids during their summer vacation in a suburb in the 80s. The reason why it probably feels genuine is that the kids do all the things you would do in a summer. Also the dark filming style fits the style of the 80s.Secondly this movie never loses momentum. The pace of this movie is slow. It's mainly psychological. It can be compared to the movie Disturbia. However slow doesn't mean boring. It keeps you guessing. The social activity of the group who are trying to find out if the neighbor is really a serial killer, is so relatable that it will keep you hooked in.Lastly Summer of 84 dares to be different. The ending is very strong. It's the cherry on top of this great movie.",Summer of 84

71,shannen-l-c,Predictable and mediocre,5,12 September 2018,"First of all, I went into this expecting a true horror, but found that 'Summer of 84' was very far from that. There are a few scenes that are on the border of horror, but this is first a foremost a teenage thriller flick. 80s nostalgia seems to be very much ""in"" at the moment, particularly following the success of Stranger Things. Whilst there is nothing wrong in taking inspiration from other movies/shows, it did feel that this was a mash-up of previous 80s content. A group of four friends that ride bikes around their quiet suburban town, communicate via walkie talkies and spend their time doing ""nerd"" stuff like conspiracy theories and playing in the arcades - sound familiar? At times, it did feel like an exact replica of Stranger Things, but unfortunately the characters were lacking the same substance and charisma than Mike, Dustin, Lucas and Will. Putting that aside, the plot itself was stagnant, slow and predictable. There were moments of suspense but ultimately, the story unravels in exactly the way I expected. Whilst there were a couple of moments that took me by surprise, for the most part there was nothing surprising or exciting that happened. The ending was underwhelming, incomplete and it felt like the dramatic events of the movie were swept aside immediately afterwards. I do think this movie has some value in reminding us that criminals are everywhere and are often the people we least expect. Serial killers are not obvious to spot in society, in fact, they're experts at blending in and being ""normal"", that's why they're able to get away with their crimes. This movie highlights that fact and is thought provoking in that manner. However, the way the kids react to thinking their neighbour is a potential serial killer of young boys their own age is ridiculous. Despite seeming genuinely convinced their neighbour is guilty of the crimes, they treat it like a game and it's framed in a very comedic way until the last 15-20 minutes. I don't know any children that would turn vigilante in that way and risk their safety by hunting a suspected child killer in such a nonchalant way. It might be the 80s, when there was less for kids to do in the way of technology, but no kid is so bored that they'd willingly engage in such a dangerous task with no thought for their safety. Unfortunately, despite the potential and the realness of a serial killer potentially living next door to you, the majority of the movie feels too far fetched for me to even believe it. Overall, this movie fell completely flat for me. It kept my attention because I was intrigued to see what twists and turns would develop, but unfortunately, it remained on a straight and predictable road that left me feeling underwhelmed and disappointed.",Summer of 84
72,makleen2,A Suburb Can be a Dangerous Place,7,12 October 2018,"A gang of bicycle-riding teen boys try to track down a neighborhood serial killer in this suburban Gothic send up to 1980s horror. Written by Matt Leslie and Stephen J. Smith and directed by a trio known for their 1980s-style films, casual viewers will undoubtedly accuse Summer of 84 (2018) of ripping off the Netflix series Stranger Things, but it is far more subtle in its nostalgia and grounded in reality. There are no supernatural elements here, only the real-life horror inflicted by unassuming suburban dwellers like John Wayne Gacy and William Bonin.The year is 1984, and a serial killer stalks the fictional county of Cape May, Oregon. Fifteen-year-old Davey Armstrong (Graham Verchere), an avid follower of conspiracy theories and reader of the Weekly World News, becomes convinced his neighbor, police officer Wayne Mackey (Rich Sommer), is the ""Cape May Slayer"" after seeing a photo on the back of a milk carton of a missing boy he previously noticed inside Mackey's house.He enlists the help of his skeptical friends, Dale ""Woody"" Woodworth (Caleb Emery), Curtis Farraday (Cory Gruter-Andrew), and Tommy ""Eats"" Eaton (Judah Lewis) to spy on Mackey. They follow him on his nightly jog to a storage unit, where they find several suspicious items, including the missing boy's bloodstained shirt. Davey presents their evidence to his parents (played by Jason Gray-Stanford and Shauna Johannesen), but his plan backfires when they become angry and force him to apologize to Mackey.Davey's friend and former babysitter, Nikki Kaszuba (Tiera Skovbye), also tries to convince Davey to abandon his pursuit, but after several strange interactions with Mackey, Davey convinces his friends to give him one last chance to prove Mackey is the killer. I won't spoil the ending, but it is sickeningly real and terrifying. Summer of 84 pulls no punches when it comes to delivering an emotionally impactful climax.Summer of 84's undercurrent of child abductions and neighborhood pedophiles is uncomfortably familiar to anyone who grew up during the 1980s. The only thing missing is a creepy white van and rumors of Satanic cults. High profile cases of missing kids in the late 1970s and early '80s led to the ""Stranger Danger"" panic, and the use of milk cartons to spread photos of missing children. Before the Internet, a photo on a milk carton was the most assured way of reaching every home in America.As suburban Gothic horror, however, Summer of 84 argues it is not strangers you have to fear, but familiar faces in your own neighborhood. Even serial killers have to live somewhere, after all. ""Just past the manicured lawns and friendly waves, inside any house, even the one next door, anything could be happening, and you'd never know,"" the narrator tells us. ""...It may seem normal and routine, but the truth is, the suburbs are where the craziest s--t happens.""In the vein of films like The Goonies (1985), The Monster Squad (1987), and It (2017), Summer of 84 features a group of kids investigating mysterious circumstances in their neighborhood, while adults seem oblivious or in denial. However, Summer of 84 has much more in common with my favorite horror-comedy of all time, The 'Burbs (1989). In both films, the protagonists work to expose a hidden threat in their otherwise tranquil and unassuming cul-de-sac.This film borrows many elements from The 'Burbs, including digging through a neighbor's trash and backyard for clues, breaking into a neighbor's house to investigate a possible disappearance, accidentally burying their walkie talkie in dirt so they can't hear warnings the suspect is returning home, and so on. The protagonists in Summer of 84 could easily be adolescent versions of Ray, Mark, and Art in The 'Burbs.Summer of 84 received moderately favorable reviews from critics and audiences alike, with a 66% aggregate favorability among critics and 71% among audiences on RottenTomatoes. Unfortunately, this film had a severely limited theatrical release and suffered from market burnout. There have been an excess of films and popular series playing on '80s nostalgia in recent years, and some people (wrongly) dismiss it as just another horror film trying to ride that wave. It won't disappoint if given a chance.",Summer of 84
73,persian-belle,Not for teens,1,26 February 2019,"I understand this film may be appallingly nostalgic for some who were teenagers in the 1980. However this is not how all teens spoke and acted.

Language and behaviour of these young boys is horrible. Please don't let your young watch it. It only teaches them derogatory language and disrespect towards women.Storyline was alright but this film is poison for young minds who absorb cuss words from the media and unfortunately sometimes look to the media to learn how to think about a woman or treat a woman.

The acting by the kids, the 80's setting, the funny moments and the countless suspenseful moments were all pretty great.I've noticed tons of reviews comparing this to Stranger Things, but it is nothing like it. They are both set in the 80's and both have a group of boys being adventurous and curious, but that's about as far as the similarities go. This movie is far more realistic and suspenseful. Though it isn't necessary a horror movie, it is aimed more towards the mature audience than Stranger Things is by a long shot.Besides all that, it did have it's flaws. To me it was too much of a teen flick than a horror flick which is what it is labeled as. It starts off with the suspicions pretty early, but it seems like it's more than halfway through the movie before anything really ""scary"" or super suspenseful actually happens. There's still a lot in the movie, but this to me wasn't a horror movie in any way. However, when the suspenseful moments kick in, they are pretty up there.I didn't care for the ending either.

The worst part about the movie isn't that though, it's that it's not even a good Stranger Things ""episode"". The story is not very interesting and it comes together relatively disorganized; the motives make little sense; it even ends in a not very satisfying or consistent manner.I would normally give it a generous 6 out of 10, mainly because the cinematography was pleasing (though still ""copy-pasted"") but after seeing how overrated it is I'm inclined to go lower.",Summer of 84

What I thought was going to happen didn't. I had it played out in my head what they would be and was totally wrong. I'm not going to give away anything, but let's just say it was a very gut-wrenching and interesting conclusion. The technical aspects of the film were on point. The film looked great. The score was perfect, and the actors did a phenomenal job. The story had me hooked from the moment the film started. While the 80's nostalgia wave has been done a lot recently I'm okay with that as long as it's quality like this.Again as I so often say this film probably won't be for everyone but for me, it worked on all levels. It's not what I would consider an instant classic but it's a solid film through and through. It had the right mix of everything I like about a suspense/adventure film. If you go into this not expecting their previous movie or a gore fest I think you'll enjoy it. If you like story driven suspense films this should be right up your alley.

I liked it more than Disturbia (which was too slick) and more than the remake of It (which was too CGI action-oriented to be scary). Even though the story of Summer of 84 is not at all supernatural, the film recalls Phantasm (1979) in the way that its mood blends easy going playfulness with eerie suspense and horror.

Most of the fond remembrances of mid-80s suburbia seem to be coming from people who were born in 1995, and who are under the impression that John Hughes and Steven Spielberg were capturing the period with documentary realism.On a positive note: this movie left me with deeper respect for superficially similar but smarter and more soulful movies like My Friend Dahmer, and for some of the more innovative recent genre movies like Thelma, Hereditary, Coherence, Berberian Sound Studio, Rubber, and Annihilation.",Summer of 84

Its about a group of kids in the 80s who have an adventurous summer but thats where the similarities end. It held up quite well on it's own. No supernatural stuff, No aliens or other dimensions, just a good old thriller. Has the story been done before, well yeah sure it has, every story is a reimaging of an earlier story isn't it? This is done well, the kids and actually all the actors played their parts well. Story was captivating and kept me glued. The only thing that was a bit odd is that for the first 2/3 of the film its a boys adventure/thriller then boom that last 20-30 minutes turns full blown thriller but it worked for it. Thinking back on it I'm surprised that didn't turn me off of the whole thing, but it worked. Not sure how they made me like that turn of events but they did, Kudos to all involved.",Summer of 84
98,popcolin,Unsurprisingly Unoriginal,3,28 September 2019,"Not sure what they were trying to do here. Cashing in on the newly founded 80's aestetic in the most boring and unoriginal of ways. I guess they were just making a movie that has been made so many times before that nothing is surprising in the least.It has that whole 80's feel in the soundtrack and the art direction but that is where the compliments end because nearly every scene I have seen done before. Cliche scene after cliche scene.It just seems rude to just make a movie that has already been made. Clearly I am in the minority here not liking it but if I'm gonna watch an 80's style movie I want to watch one that actually brings something new to the genre instead of this non-sense giving people literally the formula for these types of movies with nothing new to add.Watch at your own risk, but I assure you you have seen this movie before just under different names.",Summer of 84

100,DrDarkness,This is how you do a mystery thriller!,8,31 August 2018,"With the 80's being the ""hot feature"" right now I was afraid of how this film would be screaming it all over - but it didn't. Sure, when we're seeing a world living in the 80's, we'll get to see certain things. But luckily Summer of 84 focuses on the story, not the time (at least not too much - only as much as it's appropriate).I was cautious as the film is nearly two hours long, but the story gets you on the edge of your seat easily, and keeps you there. I love how the movie and the plot are taking their time, without rushing and forcing the details down your throat, and still everything's going steadily forward without getting stuck. And I absolutely loved the small details the movie scattered here and there.The actors do a superb job. Graham Verchere, Judah Lewis, Caleb Emery, Cory Gruter-Andrew and Rich Sommer are now names I want to se more of, though everyone else in the movie were great, too.This film was pure enjoyement from the start to finish. I love how the ending wasn't what I presumed it to be. I can honestly say that Summer of 84 became one of my favorite mystery / thriller movie, and I don't even like those genres that much.",Summer of 84

For most part you even get a feeling like the 'Blurbs' but yet it stands out. The music is just BRILLIANT. You will fall in love with the score. You may even fall in love with some of the characters.

With the help of Nikki (Tiera Skovbye), the group spies and gather evidence in hopes of getting to the truth. But as they get closer to the truth, things quickly turn dangerous.The core group of teens, (also including Judah Lewis, Caleb Emery, and Cory Gruter-Andrew) did a fantastic job and work as though they are a true group of friends. Adding Skovbye as the girl next door, adds a layer that brings you into suburbia. Rich Sommer plays the role of accused Officer Mackey with heart and understanding. The cast is what really bring this film together.The soundtrack and score also put you right back into the 80's. They compliment the period correct production and costume design. The score stands out as the perfect side to the suspense the directing team are working to carry outWhile this film is a horror, and it does have very tense moments, it teeters closer to a thriller. Some plot points are predictable and recycled, which most most thrillers are, but there are some fresh elements that keep the viewer invested. Some supporting cast have decent yet forgettable roles.A very contained thriller, Summer of 84 ticks all the boxes for fans of the genre. You will be pulled in multiple directions and keeping you on the edge of your seat, you will try to crack the case yourself.",Summer of 84

Its target in sight, and innocence dragged off, painting their face in fear. Death is but an inch away, but the monster thinks otherwise. Instead, he molds his skin, portrays the innocent man and leaves his prey to the darkest thought that one day, he would return for him. All because they saw his true face, and no more would the innocent ride their bikes, chase their friends around, or think of the girl next door because the only memory left now is the horror-stained Summer of 84, a haunt of Stranger Things and Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark with a bite of Halloween (1978).",Summer of 84

Sure the plots a little stretched and at times silly, but it's all part and parcel of that 80's coming of age charm, for me personally, and this film does nail that aspect of it, almost felt like I was watching an 80's movie.Good performances, and moves along well enough that you're never actually bored, despite a fairly long runtime for a film of this type.I give it a thumbs up. Perfect? Far from it. Good watch? Most definitely.",Summer of 84

But then I realized that the acting was pretty good and some of the lines these kids had were kind of funny. It kept annoying me that these kids didn't know how to spy! Everybody knows to turn your lights off in your room when you are spying on someone so they can't see you. My favorite character dies, which is unexpected, so that was sad. He was the best one out of all of them, and now the mom is all alone in her depression. It's not meant to be a horror film but it was definitely suspenseful.",Summer of 84

In this movie the kids are way smarter than the adults the are leading the case 80's style. Talkie, following the suspect in bike ect...

112,SomaQuest,Not Your Typical Serial Killer Film,7,30 October 2018,"First and foremost - this film is not to be compared to Stranger Things and / or It because it was never intended to be compared to those films.Summer of '84 is a well constructed indie slow-burn film which draws on the neighborhood and suburban vibe which was only realized fully in this country during the 1980's. Harkening back to such classic films as The 'Burbs, Rear Window, When A Stranger Calls Back and other such '80s gems that hone in on the mentality of evil in our midst sight brought about by the Cold War and anti-communist rhetoric of 1950's McCarthyism.Many of our younger readers will not remember a time when kids actually played outside at night in the neighborhood. Games we all loved such as Kick the Can or War or Flashlight Tag, games that parents secretly worried would expose us to that unknown evil... it is this mindset that Summer of '84 sets itself on.Not your typical serial killer film, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. I will say I was surprised by the ending as I am cursed with determining the plot too early for most films - this one blindsided me and for that I thank the writers.Haters of this film either 1) Don't understand that a horror movie doesn't have to be all in-your-face or 2) have no recollection of life during that period so don't see it as realistic. I was that age during the '80s and I vividly remember playing those games, being exposed to nudie mags, doing the neighborhood festivals, hearing about killers and half-wishing something happened in my area so I could play hero.Well done production crew.",Summer of 84

It's filmed in 80's fashion too. Really well done amd paced. The film could have actually been made in the 80's it's done so well.
Based around a group of 15 year old friends who belive their neighbour is a serial killer. They persue to invesigate and gain evidence. Whether or not their neighbour turns out to be the killer is for you to find out.
I don't want to give away too much so I will stop there. Just enjoy. But if you are after a lot of gore, kill scenes and jump scares, this film may not be for you. Bjt if you have the paitience to sit through the character build up and a nostelgia trip back to being a kid in the 80's then this is a great movie and well worth a watch.",Summer of 84

What I hate about remakes of the 80s is that almost no one cares about making it authentic. They throw in a few things but the lingo, the hairdue, the fashion anf colors are all wrong.So thats a big minus for this movie.The other thing is that everything is so predicable. They telegraph every scene a mile away.The third thing is the very weird ending. Its like a third act after the resolution.

If, as a young teenager, you really thought you were investigating a notoriously evil serial killer, you would be far more careful/cautious with everything you did. Also, the pace was incredibly slow. The parents were also total losers and unbelievably so. What father pulls that kind of stunt with their son to punish him? GTFO.Such a shame.

The story story follows a group of kids trying to catch a killer at large. The acting was great for a low budget indie film. Each character felt believable and had their own problems to deal with. The cinematography was also very good making it look like a film you'd see in most movie theatres (which movies like this deserve to be shown in them). The soundtrack was absolutely amazing. It gave me that Stranger Things vibe which is really good considering how much I love the soundtrack for that show. The only issue I had was the story. The story was great and tense until the ending. Don't get me wrong, the ending wasn't bad it just didn't sit well with me after everything came together. Summer of 84 was very exciting and a joy to watch. This is a must see! 9/10",Summer of 84

The dialogue was really tough stuff but the production values are high and I like the actors.The musical score is mixed too loud and becomes tediously irritating; however, I think this is consistent with 80s films and may be appropriate for the film.Very distracting how autumnal a ""summer"" movie can feel. The characters are always wearing jackets.",Summer of 84
127,jrgirones,A delight of a thriller,8,25 August 2018,"Yes, the ressemblances to ""Stranger Things"", ""Suburbia"" and so on are evident from the very start, but fortunately this achieves a life of its own thanks to deft and clever narrative (it grabs you even if the plot rings familiar and it has the guts to end in a way that's hardly predictable), high production values despite working with an indie budget and - crucially - convincing acting from all the kids (Rich Sommer is very effective too as the ambiguous neighbor). Kept me very entertained all the way and the end was a distinctive plus. If you previously enjoyed the films that inspired this, you may still check it out... It's a delight of a thrill ride.",Summer of 84

Literally 90% of the scenes are completely useless. Most of them could be cut out without affecting what little. story is being told.The movie starts with the kids talking about sex and looking at the playboy. Then they talk about the suspect buying tons of dirt every week, then they're at the bowling alley talking about sex and checking out girls, then they follow the suspect a first time and see him... buying dirt (IT'S ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED!!!), then a kid we have never seen gets kidnapped (he comes out of his house in the middle of the night for whatever reason, hears weird footsteps and runs away in a dark alley instead of going back right inside ??). NEVER will this kid's disappearance be mentioned! Then we see our moronic heros drinking while making more sex jokes, etc etc etc NOTHING is going on! Useless and dull scenes follow each others on and on until that moronic ending everyone is complaining about.On the directorial side, the film is shot in the most bare bone, TV show style as if it was an episode of Degrassi.

The kids are not annoying but actually likeable and knew how to act. It was all very exciting from the beginning showing the simple life of the 80s kids, almost wishing I grew up as a kid then.

This film does not have that. The acting is not great and the characters and story is poor.This is a very sloppy, lazy film aimed at those who just nostslgia and who do not care about quality.This is a film I took a chance on without watching the trailer but I really wish I hadn't.

The 80s feel is also quite similar to stranger things, but it is a very different story. I feel like we all had a story growing up that made our parents uneasy and kept us more indoors due to fear. In Summer of 84 the kids observe their neighbour who they suspect is a serial killer.

The first 1/3 of the film was a bunch of 15 year old talking about girls, sex, etc. the piled it on a bit heavy. It was actually distracting from the plot.Once past that, it picked up a lot. It had a standard ""I live in a small town with a serial killer"" vibe. The acting was good, it was suspenseful and kept me guessing. I enjoyed that quite a bit!

Let's analyze why.I was having the best time watching this. The 80s atmosphere was excellent and perfectly recreated (thanks, in large part, to Stranger Things, you can feel they got inspired).Tha acting was adequate, the young kids did a nice job and they were well characterized. Maybe the love interest segments were a little out of context, but the chemistry was true, though I'm not sure if completely realistic, considering the fact that the two had a large age difference.The mystery was there, the tension was great and clever, for an indipendent film such as this.But bloody hell.. What's with productions completely SCREWING movies and TV shows lately?The ending spoiled the entire thing for me, it was stupid, it was frustrating.
Okay, I get it, you, Director, want to do your best to shock me, the Viewer, but why here? Why in this film? It was completely unnecessary, it felt forced and totally different from the rest of the movie's tones.So I decided I'll just pretend the last 10 minutes don't exist, because I want the experience to feel complete, not ruined.

However, what I really quite didn't like was that the 1984 in the title is only mainly because they want to make a sequel out of it. There was nothing that reminded me of the wonderful 80's decade. Music was modern to attract modern children, looks and clothes and cars sand hairstyles, none of them gave me an 80's vibe.

149,skylerisaac,A Nice Homage,7,20 May 2019,"Summer of '84 is a lovingly crafted homage to films of the 80s, and plays like an excellent cross between The 'Burbs and The Goonies. The story revolves around a group of kids who begin to suspect that one of their neighbors is a notorious serial killer.The child actors are excellent. Unfortunately, they're handed a lot of rubbish dialogue about tits and masturbation during the first half hour or so. It really seems like it was written by someone who had no friends at that age who just speculated as to what teenagers talked about. Thankfully, this subject matter tapers off after the first act.This film was made by the directorial trio responsible for Turbo Kid, which is an all time favorite of mine. Summer of 84 isnt nearly as excellent as TK, but it does manage to hold it's own.The cinematography is decent, if mostly unimaginative. The synth score by Le Matos is just okay, and sounds a bit generic. The film is also dragged down by a handful of cheap and dull jump scares.Overall, a solid film that all fans of horror and 80s family films should check out.7/10",Summer of 84

153,parkerama,This is neither here nor there,5,3 February 2021,"This movie had tons of potential and for some maybe a easy good watch.In my opinion it was predictable, bad coverage in scenes and no shock value. I wouldn't consider this Horror in the least.That being said, the set Dec of the 80's is amazing. The action was sub par but had that creepy value from the neighbour; which without him would've made this movie a DONT WATCH.
If your looking for mystery and 80's, id say just stick to ""Stranger Things""
If your looking for horror, skip over this one.But if your like me, you'll probably giver a watch to give your own input.

154,johnnyutah31,Summer of Scary Fun,8,18 September 2018,"Probably the biggest appeal of this movie is its 80's themed aesthetic. But finally getting to watch this I was hoping it wasn't just another film cashing in on that nostalgia because we all know that's certainly the thing to do these days. Thankfully the movie genuinely portrays that era and gives you a fun and engaging experience as well. First off if you're going into this film expecting a traditional horror, you'll be disappointed. It's much more of a mystery, suspense with bits of horror tackled in towards the end. Think of films like ""Disturbia"" (2007) mixed with of-course some of ""The Goonies"" (1985). Here we have a group of young kids who suspect that their neighbor who is also a policeman, is a serial killer. Simple setup and something that's not entirely new but the film handles it very nicely in ways that makes it all feel incredibly fresh. All the youngsters are a joy to watch and the exchanges between them are natural and at times downright hilarious. The mystery unfolds like you'd expect but it also takes a few different directions that may surprise you. I was really looking forward to this one and I'm glad it didn't disappoint. It's a fun film that while it does pay homage to films of that era, it does so in such a way that it could've indeed been released in the 80's and we're just now getting around to seeing it. One of the year's best.",Summer of 84

-This is probably the best child lead performances I've seen yet. Chemistry between em is undeniably funny and full of one-liners.
-Rich Sommer as the cop gives a superb and chilling performance. His delivery with dialogue and acting was quite amazing.

You really got to see into the woes and highs of 80s suburban life, it's important to build this in a movie so you feel a connection with it's characters. The likes of Spielberg knew this. It's all those little things you notice. I really enjoyed it but I can see how it's not going to leave a lasting impression on some. The script was a little lackluster. Acting, for the most part is pretty decent.

I've seen other reviews comparing it to that garbage stranger things show (1st season was good rest has been boring and seems to be going nowehere). Also, guys not everything that has a group of young kids as the leads needs to be compared to that. ST didnt invent the 80s. Anyhow it sets off like a fun little buddy film which reminded me of the burbs - an all time classic - but the kids version. Like that movie i was always guessing whether or not the supposed killer was actually in fact a killer and it wasnt all a misunderstanding. The film played on this very well.Where the film falls apart for me is that the characters are particularly likeable. Its not that they're unlikeable - theyre just a bit 'meh'. Also the last 15 minutes really take this film in a different path which was a real shock. Although i welcome the idea of this as i dont think ive seen a kids movie take this kind of a turn - it felt a bit unwarrented. Was the film gripping and entertaining enough beforehand i would have let them off the hook. But of a suckerpunch that the film didnt deserve to pull off.Overall, kinda fun little flick but id recommend the burbs.",Summer of 84
162,ddcharbon,Will the Real Summer of 84 Please Stand Up?,7,21 October 2021,"Summer of 84 (2018) feels almost like two movies-the first 90 minutes nods heavily towards 80s nostalgia and plays like a less well-paced version of Disturbia with Canadian teen actor Graham Verchere in the Shia LaBeouf role and usually nice guy Rich Sommer cast as the killer-next-door played by David Morse in the earlier flick. (Disturbia was itself a somewhat tepid, adolescent version of Hitchcock's masterpiece Rear Window.)But the last 15 minutes of Summer of 84 are as chilling as anything with a PG-13 rating can be. From a rather plodding pace with a lot of moments straight out of a John Hughes film (think geeky teens behind binoculars creaming their jeans for unattainably hot high school girls) to a conclusion that Hitchcock could have authored, this flick undergoes a major personality shift. The turn can be precisely located in the film, beginning with a very slow pan of a darkened hallway in which something quite ordinary-but in this context, absolutely terrifying-descends from the ceiling. From thereon, you are in a much darker movie with the capacity to leave you unsettled even as you come out of the theatre into bright sunlight.This movie-like the 80s nostalgia-thon Stranger Things-had multiple directors (three, in fact) and I can't help but wonder if one of them was steering the hog for the last 15 minutes who was only riding sidecar for the first hour and a half. There's hardly a chilling moment in that first 90 minutes. But the final confrontation between the killer and the kid is both unexpected in its outcome and damn near perfect filmmaking. Our hero discovers that being charming and uncommonly perceptive when you are just a fifteen-year-old boy going up against a psychopath may not be enough.Most of the movie is a faded copy of better originals, but let's hope the evil genius who gave us the last fifteen minutes resurfaces for a whole movie soon.",Summer of 84

Definitely recommend.",Summer of 84
164,sheepfood,Disappointed,1,29 October 2019,"I almost didn't want to write a review for this. Just thought to myself to just leave the low rating and move on.But the whole movie actually pisses me off a lot.
THIS IS a Stranger things clone (poor attempt too).Format :
4 kids (even the type of personality combo in the group is typical)Likes bicycles againUsing walkies talkies againA hot teen girl ((love-interest to main lead) just becauseSame music styleJust like typical hollywood style, whenever something is ""working well"" or gaining popularity, someone producer/director will come out and make a clone of it with little imagination and effort.Too bad, the movie is not good at all (and especially if you've seen stranger things already). Stranger things works becoz all the characters are genuinely interesting and believable. Summer of 84's characters are all not believable. Not even the main lead. Also stranger things have some good sci-fi plot backing it. This has got NONE. The plot actually has zero depth and development. The movie just tries to create the illusion (but failed of course).
And some other dumb thing is, 1) As a policeman, Mackey didn't even think about covering up his nephew ""Jamie"" fake story with a fake phone number right after mentioning that he will offer to call the kid to show that the kid was ok? And also later using Davey's house phone to call himself ?! (most Phones Have Call History). 2) After Mackey was exposed, and Davey knowing that he is next because he saw his photo inside Mackey's house, the police didn't bother to assign some protection at least for the 1st 24 hour near his house ?!
The man is STILL AT LARGE! And is a serial killer cop! Not a typical murderer! 3) I believe police cruisers have inbuilt tracking device .. but ok maybe Mackey got it removed. 4) Mackey actually lets Davey go .... really. Come'on there is nothing epic between both of them. The movie is trying to be dramatic. I personally thinks that the director does so because he thinks it's 'not nice' to kill off a ""smart young main character"". And also, maybe so he can make a sequel.This is such a bad clone. And very desperate to copy stranger things.",Summer of 84

Ive got to admit when it turned darker in the last third i enjoyed it more,as quite frankly the synth/pop soundtrack of the first hour or so was doing my head in!....

Or are the Directors so absorbed now-a-days in their rich Hollywood lives, that that's ""normal"" to them.

And as for hair and makeup... what? Run a comb through the hair? It's like you watch these 2010+ movies and it's not actors playing people anymore. It's actors playing actors. It goes to show how out of touch Hollywood is with the rest of America. Any air of authenticity is lost...and as an audience member I felt left out. It's as if this movie was made for ME.

This is a fantastic little flick, extremely well written and directed and the lead players all give great performances, very typical of how teens were portrayed in the movies of the era.
The story centres around a group of four teenagers who begin to suspect that a neighbour is the notorious 'Cape Bay Slayer'. Nothing particularly original in the concept, we've seen it before in movies like The Burbs and Disturbia, even as far back as Hitchcock's Rear Window. The trick here is in the execution, and it's clearly a movie that's been made with a real love for the 80s and for the genre.
Those of us who were there will enjoy the pop culture references, which thankfully aren't over used and are subtly included to set the tone.
There's the usual annoyance of characters doing things that are apt to get them into trouble, but hey it's a movie and so we need these situations to unfold otherwise it would be pretty boring watching them hang out in a treehouse for 100 minutes right?
I won't drop any spoilers, the movie is better if you just go in and let it happen.Give this one a chance and you'll be pleasantly surprised, I know I was.",Summer of 84

Then the twists felt loosely written, so was the storyline. & The twists did not have much effect anyways. Worst, of all, it was not scary at all. At no point did I feel, the leads were at a threat, the killer never felt to be onto them, or challenge them. The parents felt stupid as they did not find a bloody cloth of a probable victim good enough evidence, while himself being a journalist. Moreover, he goes over to a policeman, to admit of his kid's very much punishable offence(where r the brains?) & turns over the evidence without speculating on it. For a reporter it cud have been a huge story.
Not many scary situations come up, and when the killer attacks in the end, he drags it too far for a person who has been killing over a period of 8 yes or so, and appears rather amateurish.
And the most likable guy gets killed of without any buildup. Only parts likable are the chemistry between the four friends & woody.",Summer of 84

No one puts in a stinker but it's all very simple and uninspiring work. And the storyline was about as rudimentary as you can get, with the reveal being utterly predictable. I saw a comment somewhere that this movie is just a collection of ideas stolen... sorry, 'borrowed' from other films. It is exactly that. There is nothing new in it whatsoever.Except perhaps for the bizarre tonal shift that happens in the last 15 minutes and turns what was a 'fun', almost light-hearted mystery into something very dark and pretty ugly.

The 'romance' was just awful as was 95% of the acting.The story doesn't hold your attention and you just wander off thinking about other things, like when will it end. It just feels as if you've see it all before.  The saving grace is the last 10 minutes, and that's it, it just makes you think that you never know what goes on behind closed doors, (usually affairs). If you've nothing better to do, give it a watch, it's not the worst film you'll see this year, but come the next day you'd have forgotten you'd watched it.",Summer of 84

No, I don't hate movies but modern Hollywood has completely lost sight of what made movies great. Luckily, we have people like RKSS to make movies outside of the studio system.I will first of all like to state that this movie is not a masterpiece, per se, it's just a really good film in a world where we get a butt ton of bad films. The story is very Monster Squad meets Rear Window. A lot of people keep comparing this to Stranger Things but the only similarity I see is that they're both set in the 1980's. Did Stranger Things totally monopolize the 1980's or something?The film is well acted and well shot. I don't want to say too much about the plot but I will say that the third act is absolutely wonderful!Summer of '84 is a true diamond in the rough.

204,yairsm,"Boring first 2/3, better last 1/3",7,16 September 2018,"The first 2/3 of the movie was pretty boring and dragging... Instead of focusing on character development or moving the plot along, the plot consists of the kids spying on their neighbor and not discovering anything. The plot stays stuck in the same place for the majority of the movie.
The big reveal at the end was what made the film pay off, however the last several minutes were way too out there and not in keeping with the nature of the film. The killing of Woody was totally unnecessary and was certainly out of place in the atmosphere that the film created. The ending was also entirely unbelievable... There's a reason they showed nothing between the boys getting drugged and them waking up in the car in the middle of an island- it's completely implausible and there is no believable way it could have been pulled off.
The film was still, however, worth the time. It was good overall.",Summer of 84

210,groovygirl112006,"Could've been special, but not so much....",6,6 October 2018,"I sat down to watch this movie for a couple reasons: I like horror/suspense/thriller movies, I enjoy serial killer plots and I love the 80's. Hoping to be blown away by an amazing, immersive 80s flick, I ended up with a dry, superficially nostalgic and all-around cliche teen movie. The 80s vibe is lost on this. Yes, Le Matos does an amazing synth soundtrack as always, but that is not enough to save this movie. Short of name dropping a bunch of TV and movie references and sticking 80s props in scenes, there is no 80s heart to this movie. Stereotypes run rampant, and not in a good way.
Character development is very shallow and nonexistent for certain characters and the plot is very slow. I know that the 80s were a time when people still felt safe in their neighborhoods, but people in this fictional town are downright oblivious and negligent. Kids out at all hours, no one notices strange activity, how the single next door neighbor watches the kids play, etc.
I really wanted to love this movie (despite it being a very similar ripoff of Stranger Things, Disturbia, Rear Window and The Burbs all rolled in to one).
The only thing I truly respected about this movie was the ending. It was not cliche or expected, however a little dopey given what the antagonist was able to pull off with NO ONE noticing. It was dark and not happy, which is rare for a coming-of-age flick. Overall, not the worst I've seen, but nowhere near the best. At least it kept me watching until the end, despite being fairly bored and irritated at ridiculous plot points. 
Worth a watch for the novice horror or nostalgic movie fan.",Summer of 84

214,kitellu,A Complete Surprise,7,25 August 2018,"I was not completely intrigued to watch this movie just from the trailer but nonetheless I decided to give it a shot still and I have to admit I was taken by compete surprise of how good this movie is. It has the nostalgic 80's feeling vibes even though the story is tad predictable.The story centers around a kid, Davey Armstrong (Graham Vercere) who begins suspecting that his next door neighbor who happens to be a policeman is a serial killer. Along with his friends, they embark on this detective style search to prove that he is guilty. This type of story has been told many times before on screen but the way this movie is shot is effective. The characters are all well rounded and each character has ample time to show their worth. Also, the music is done right with the sound of the 80's style.As stated earlier, my only quibble is that the story is predictable that you know what is going to happen although there is a bit at the end of the movie that I was not expecting at all. I wished that the directors of the movie were a bit more daring and innovative because certainly this movie had more potential and it would have been much greater.All in all, if you like these type of movies, you should check this one out because even though the story is predictable and somewhat familiar there are interesting elements that makes the movie worthwhile.",Summer of 84

Every characters are incredibly fantastic, I like Woody for always standing by his friend's side, I like how Eats showed his feelings, I like Davey for being brave and I don't know what I like from Farraday, he's fine. I like how the story is just about them and their mission, so it's really fun to watch especially with a little comedy in this movie, I honestly laugh at them.My favorite is actually the ending, when Davey and Woody went to sleep I thought it was the ending and I was disappointed, but then Mackey came to do revenge and kidnap them and I was excited because finally...there's gonna be a thrilling scene. It was really sad that Woody died because he's actually my favorite, Mackey also threat Davey and I actually wish there'll be a next of this.",Summer of 84
218,vetourproductions,Great pace.,10,5 July 2019,"Summer of '84 is an impeccable period piece set in... you guessed it, 1984. Although the tendency, as of late, is to throw a synth-wave score together coupled with some vintage clothes and outdated posters to persuade a time-period to an audience, ""summer of '84"" feels different. A more genuine approach. It feels authentic for its time. The pacing is top-notch, creating a suspenseful feeling of uneasiness, while prompting the audience to feel affirmed in their suspicions only to reject that within moments. The acting is over-the-top, but the caricatures that emanate from the actors are defined and lovable. Primarily a mystery, ""summer of '84"" takes you to dark places unexpectedly, providing a sort of horror aspect through shock. Otherwise, this film feels like ""stand by me"" modernized. I, for one, am ok with the modernization",Summer of 84

221,Johnjronald-571-398268,"Amazing sound design, costume & set design and great Thriller!",10,23 August 2018,"I recently watched this movie which was given a limited 1 week run by Alamo Drafthouse in Houston, Texas. What immediately impressed me was the sound design, full of intentionally cheesy 80s synth music. It totally felt like watching a police drama from that era...I graduated High School in 1989, so I would have been about 2 years younger than the lead character Davey in 1984. The costume design is spot on; I used to own a windbreaker jacket that was exactly the same that Mr. Mackey wears in once scene, only mine was tan not yellow. The embarrassingly short men's shorts are true to the era as well.The characters are likable and believable. Davey's theory seems outlandish at first but he and his buds keep gathering clues. And even though there are plausible alternative explanations for some of the circumstantial evidence, if you're paying attention there are a few clues that still don't fit the benign explanation.It is a solid murder mystery thriller + coming of age story in the mid 1980s. It builds suspense very well. This is not a film for the overly squeamish. It deals with a serial killer and there is a body count. The conclusion is satisfying but unsettling. I have not seen any of the other films more negative reviewers are comparing this movie to; all I can say is it stands on its own merits and I was entertained. I want the soundtrack to this film and I plan to buy it on DVD so I can re-watch it, because it throws a lot of clues at you very fast and there's no chance to pause the film on the big screen. If you get a chance to see it in theaters, don't miss it!",Summer of 84

Pacing of the story is wonky. Actors are unfortunately bland. Characters themselves are a bit flat and never really develop or seem authentic. I don't even really know anybody's name except for the girl and the neighbour cop.The murderer's reveal was creepy and unique, and I liked how the story wrapped up. But even that was ruined by the illogical scene in between. The murderer makes a lot of unnecessary noise for no other reason than special effects. This breaks the illusion as obviously any passerby would be able to see/hear what is going on.Something to watch if you're a really bored crime lover or want to introduce a young audience to a thriller that won't give them nightmares.

If I've learned anything, it's that people hardly ever let you know who they really are. Inside any house, even the one next door, something could be going on and you would never know.
You never know what may come around the corner ... ''
Voiceover of the initial sequence.
On some occasion in a late-night talk after having recorded scenes for a short film and having dinner burritos, back in 2007, a colleague who spoke little said something that seemed interesting to all of us gathered there and left us thinking. The conversation revolved around which were the best inventions in the history of mankind. I said the cinema. Others mentioned fire, electricity, etc. This person, when it was his turn, claimed that curtains were one of the best inventions of all time. We laughed in unison at first. When he explained that the curtains prevented situations or things from being seen from the outside that we would not like others to know about us, there was silence.
The anecdote comes up just because it is one of the main ideas that this story handles: appearances. What we project to the world, our friendly side as opposed to our dark side, our defects and character vices that we prefer to keep hidden behind the curtains.
The action takes place in Ipswich, Oregon in the summer of 1984. Following the tradition of memorable films such as: The Goonies, ET, IT and Super 8. In which the narrative thread is raised from the perspective of adolescents who with insight perceive situations in their environment that adults absorbed in their routines, cannot.
The plot is about a boy who begins to suspect that a neighbor who is a policeman, is the serial killer of adolescents who has devastated the county where he lives. It kind of reminded me of the 80s classic, '' Fright Night ''. In which a boy suspects that his neighbor is a vampire, and nobody believes him.
There is an emphasis on the reluctance of many adults to give credence to teen boy testimonials.
It is a story that, along with the investigations of the boys to verify their suspicions, authentically recreates the spirit of the eighties. First romances, first kisses, many of the concerns of that stage of life are well reflected.
Here is an impeccable handling of suspense, sowing clues in the viewer that are not necessarily true. An ingenious mind game that the directors establish with the viewer.
Despite the theme, the tone is light for much of the journey, to take an aggressive and wild turn that takes us to a brutal and terrifying final stretch that lays the foundations for a sequel that you really want.",Summer of 84
227,rrikikiki,Zero 80's feel.,1,28 November 2018,"I don't care if this is indie or not indie. The movie sucks. I appreciate that somebody was trying to do an 80's movie but come on, a true 80's kid or a lover of 80's would do ten times better job on 90% less budget. I don't care about endings I care about the movie feel. Editing is whatever, actors whatever, script bad, it all seems like regular stupid Hollywood. Hollywood has really gone down the drain in the past 10years. Wearing all stars and having an 80s song and 80's cars and 80's shorts and 80's bikes inside a movie doesn't make it an 80's movie. I suggest you spend your time watching some of the legends from the 80's and 90's. This was a waste of my time and will probably be a waste of yours. I give it 1 point for trying.",Summer of 84

I think the constant comparison to Stranger Things and Summer of 84 does this film a big disservice. The budget of Stranger Things is probably one hundred times the budget for this film firstly. Secondly there's nothing remotely supernatural about this film. There is a strong 80's theme to this film but it's not overdone. Very sympathetic characters that are easy to relate to particularly Graham and Caleb's characters. A fantastic actor as the villain really contributes to a steady build up of suspense in the film and for me at least quite a shock ending which I loved. I have watched this film a lot I would call this a highly enjoyable horror film that's very easy to watch and a very pleasant 80's soundtrack. I really hope there is a sequel in the works for this movie. I would gladly pay money to see this sequel in a cinema! Great performances from everyone, great location, great soundtrack what more can you ask for? The only negative thing I could say about the film is the dialogue at times is overcooked when the teenage boys are talking about sex or masturbation that got very repetitive very fast and took away from the overall quality of the film.

It overdoes the synth music to the point of annoyance and it hurts the movie. The setting does seem appropriate considering the subject manner, but the way it was handled could have been much better.I really wanted to like this movie but it didn't do it for me. The corny script and the predictable ""twists"" just made me wish I was re-watching The Clovehitch Killer (which was easily the best movie of last year). I didn't care for the characters and felt like they were carbon copies of more likable counterparts from Stranger Things, It and similar fare.The movie was not terrible, it was just so so bland.

Direction: 4:10
Story: 6:10
Nostalgia factor: 6:10This definitely feels like a movie made by committee. It can't quite decide what it wants to be and that probably partially stems from the number of cooks in the kitchen.
The ""child"" actors do their absolute best to embody the trope they were given but it's clear they didn't do enough homework (or the directors didn't do enough homework). They also weren't directed to avoid the obvious Canadian accents. Why not just make the movie take place in Canada? I'm sure the producers were to blame for that...also maybe it's more believable that a serial killer might exist in America?As far as directing...this is painful at times. Scenes cut off before the characters resolve their scene and then the main story jarringly transitions back in. There are a few times where they pay obvious homage to movies or culture from the 80's but it's way to few and far between. It honestly feels like the filmmakers were trying to capitalize on the success of stranger things and just failed. It's not a huge failure though and I wouldn't say I wasted my time but I fall to see any argument for rating this higher than a 5 or 6 (and 6 is pushing it).",Summer of 84

The only comparisons between this and Stand by me or Goonies is that most of the main cast is kids.In this example somehow 15 year olds that other than there constant talk of sex, act, look like, and have the hobbies of 10 year olds. My expectations for the acting in a fairly low budget film with mostly children is quite low but this is horrendous to the point that even though it doesn't need good acting to be decent for me it ruins it. It is what I would expect to see from High school students in there first few weeks of grade 9 drama class. Cliched and predictable it completely lacks any creativity or imagination in every scene which I can't tell is because of a lack of concern or just plain laziness. It reminds me a bit of a Canadian 80's micro budget show but even that had much better acting and imagination. I've never been duped worse into watching a movie by the user reviews. I can usually sniff out the fake reviews or at least get some form of picture in my mind of what I'll be watching but this time I was fooled. You guys either need to watch more good movies or be a bit more discerning.",Summer of 84

NOW!,10,26 August 2018,"All comparisons aside and to all of you that are ""like me"" that can see so many similarities to other movies in this movie can't deny that it's still worth watching!

If nothing else it has a great soundtrack ;)
Happy watching ^^",Summer of 84
247,fincargil,Hitchcock Would be Proud.,10,29 September 2018,"This is a thriller at heart, in the same way Rear Window delivers a voyeuristic experience of innocuous day to day activities until you take a closer look. What seems innocent and normal at first builds in a paranoid frenzy with a killer twist. See this movie now.",Summer of 84

If it wasn't for him, this movie would deserve a 0.Oh, and Bad Religion wasn't popular in 1984. Not enough to get to that annoying kid anyway.",Summer of 84

251,matt_ebgames,"A good watch, without being amazing",7,20 January 2020,"Allot better than I thought it would be. Kept me entertained the whole movie. Issues were around a few plot holes. I found it crazy that with so many kids going missing that all the parents in the movie seemed so happy to leave their kids alone. I also didn't really feel that the movie was really in the 80s. Sure the clothes were 80s, but the way the characters talked and the overall atmosphere didn't feel real. Compare to the first instalment of the Stephen king IT movie a few years ago, where the whole town felt like it was authentic. A good little twist ending that took it from a solid 6/10 to an 7/10",Summer of 84
252,baileywiley,Summer of '84 - An indie Gem,8,25 August 2018,"I don't know why some people have been giving this mediocre reviews. I mean the premise has been done before of course. But at the same time there's a great nostalgia factor, and it does well with what it's going for. And the comedy doesn't feel forced throughout. There's a perfect mixture of humor and thriller in this hour forty five flick with some pretty decent acting. And a very nice looking 80's setting. Yes it has factors from the movie ""disturbia"" which I think this film does better and has a better third act then that film. All in all I believe people have been judging the movie solely off the trailer alone. And that's not doing this movie justice that it deserves. Isn't a perfect film but it's a damn good time",Summer of 84

255,sonichawk,Extremely well-done,9,23 October 2019,"I thought this was an extremely suspenseful, well-done movie. The last 5 minutes were jaw-dropping. I did not find it as implausible as some. I expect that the killer chloroformed the parents first which is how he was able to extract the two youth without waking the parents. There is a lot that happens off-camera. They just caught The Golden State Killer, an ex-cop, after 40 years. He went unnoticed too. Fact is stranger than fiction.Just suspend your disbelief and go with it. I found it to be great entertainment.",Summer of 84
256,dj_vlado,Absolute beaut.,10,26 December 2018,"This flick was a great addition to the contemporary thriller/horror genre with great intensity, storytelling, character build, cinematography and acting. Furthermore, watching this movie in the context of recent teenage-horror releases such as Stranger Things and IT, but also all badly produced Horror movies (excluding i.e. James Wan) many clichés were to be expected but not delivered. I felt that Summer of 84 brought lot of new with a nostalgic 80s kick to it, but without falling into fallacy of reproduction of same ideas.Overall great, thrilling and well-rounded movie that keeps you pinned down to the bottom of the sofa in suspense. Bravo.",Summer of 84
257,technetium-94107,80s Nostalgia with a twisted ending,9,14 November 2018,"I recently discovered this little gem of a movie having heard or read nothing about it. However, being a massive fan of 80's movies such as The Burbs, Stand by Me and the Goonies I was excited to watch it.The movie basically is a mixture of all those movies mentioned above, it follows a similar plot especially to the Burbs, where a group of friends suspect their neighbour, who happens to be a cop is a serial killer and is burying people in his back garden. The main character, Davey played by Graham Verchere convinces his friends to do some investigating while the suspect, Wayne Mackey played by Rich Sommer is out of the house at night doing suspicious after hours activities.Having found nothing, and caught by his parents Davey is made to apologise to his friendly neighbourhood cop for the misunderstanding. However, Davey still thinks something is not quite right and does some more investigating to find that in fact there are pictures of all the missing children in his house, and even a dead body in the bath!. They take this to the police and then a manhunt begins for Wayne and this is where you think the movie is over.....only it really isn't.I wont go into details about the ending but it is brilliant and completely unexpected and quite shocking. Its a very different take on this genre that usually gets the happy ending and I think this is why people are giving this a low rating, however for me it makes the movie even better, it is more realistic and less cliche'd compared to those earlier 80s feel good movies.People complaining this is similar to stranger things, this was originally wrote before Stranger Things came out, also Stranger things took inspiration from all those movies i mentioned above so please stop thinking it is the original 80s series that everyone is trying to copy, it copied all its ideas from the classic 80s movies the same as this does. I enjoyed both.If you enjoy all those classic 80s adventure movies you will definitely love this, it is a great movie with a really twisted ending.9/10.",Summer of 84

259,nzdischner,People are so weird!!!,10,2 September 2018,"I do not get why people are hating on this awesome film, anything that reminds me of Stranger Things, IT or The Goonies I'm down to enjoy, besides, the story line was not even the same as any of those, it was not about a creature from another dimension or a clown abducting and eating children or a hidden pirate ship with treasure, it was about a psychotic serial killer taking the lives of young boys, and whoooo cares if there's tons of movies already like this one, I thought it was great and if it's great that's all that matters to me. The ending got pretty frightening, once they finally made it to the basement everything took a huge turn and my eyes did not leave the screen until the end credits. Watch this one and don't think about comparisons while you do! The score was amazing as well!",Summer of 84
260,samdinnan,"Stand By Me rip-off, and the ending ruined it.",5,12 October 2019,"Very predictable, and most of the movie is basically Stand By Me (growing up, hard truths, adventure to find a dead body / solve a crime because ""it'd be cool"" and they'd be in the news), but I still enjoyed it... until the last 15 minutes or so, which ruined the whole movie and turned it into a teen scream slasher.
It should've ended a little bit after they showed the cops the footage of the kids in the basement. Also... this serial killer fled town after saying he's gonna come back to kill the kid one day, and he hasn't been put in Witness Protection? Sounds like they want him to die.",Summer of 84

Very bad unfortunately.",Summer of 84
262,anasbouthire,Good movie with illogical ending,7,10 October 2020,"I enjoyed the movie but that ending didn't make sense, how did mackey manage to get inside Davey's the house without getting caught? Knowing that the police found out that he was the killer by then. Let's say he managed to sneak inside before they found out, how was he able to get out without getting caught (while kidnapping woody and davey)? Policd are supposed to be all over his house at the time and knowing that his house is really close to Davey's it's impossible for him to not get caught. Also where were the parents? Who sleeps comfortably while their kid is threatened to be the next victim of a wanted serial killer?",Summer of 84

It starts out that way, and has a slow build. At times it even lags a bit, but be patient; that is only to lull you into a false sense of security. Once it really gets going, it is full of the kind of tension and Intrigue that will have you biting your fingernails and keep you on the edge of your seat. With an ending, you will not see coming and may just make you, want to have your eyesight checked.I also found this film to be well shot, acted, and directed. Capturing the true essence of the 1980's, and what it was like to be a teenage boy, growing up, at that time. All in all, a well-rounded thriller/mystery that may just leave you breathless.",Summer of 84

However, this movie hits the bullseye.Kinda takes you on a nostalgic trip if ya were into mysteries and thrillers as a kid. Shortly summed up it's about the cat and mouse game between the next door serial killer and a teen relentlessly trying to prove his point of being right about the guy.Thoroughly enjoyable for a serial killer/slasher movie and for a weekend movie night.",Summer of 84

I honestly almost had a heart attack and I did not expected that from a coming of age movie, not sure if that is a good or a bad thing, I would suspect is a good way to surprise the audience. I am all about watching this kind of movies with certain 80s, 90s or even 50s vibe these days. Yet, the 3 stars minus for the fact that the actions in the last act seem really out of touch with the reality and do not fit at all with the rest of the movie, I do not say this because of the sad aspect but because a criminal hunted by the whole town police, can not steal 2 teenage boys from their own home, from under the parents, should be, care....I mean....yeah life is unfair sometimes but it just doesnt sit good with me this time.",Summer of 84

Why does the older almost 18 year old girl want to hang around with the little kid who spies on her changing? Maybe she likes the attention but it just feels a bit too weird.#2 his parents reaction when they show them all the evidence. They literally had a t-shirt belonging to a dead child with blood on it!

I mean they are really putting on a campaign for this. Why do you think all the people who gave it rave reviews only have ONE review in their profile. Pathetic really but whatever. Here's an honest review. IT'S OKAY. I've seen worst but it's basically a Stranger Things and Disturbia rip-off. Without giving much away all I can say is the only thing saving it is the third act is decent. I really wish people could read reviews and trust them but I guess the people who make these movies can't rely on their own merits!,Summer of 84
283,ArkNep,Unpredictable Predictable,6,5 September 2019,"From the beginning of the movie, the relationship between neighbors was already very strange, highlighting the policeman from the front house. At no point in the movie, the hideout or the serial killer in plot, in various scenes, you can look for other suspects, but fails, because the movie does not allow anyone to suspect to be a unique character. Admitting from the very beginning of the movie that you already know who he really is or murderer, he now wonders how he will be discovered, since the credibility of the same era was very high and showed no suspicion that anything would happen to the other residents of the film. City. In the end, when the viewer thinks he might have a very bad ending, or the movie just started or his last act.

The movie has no scare, counts a total of 4 in all.For those who lived the 80's, can separate from a national film.The soundtrack is really spectacular.At the end, make room for a possible continuation.",Summer of 84

You know that feeling when you watch a movie you saw a lot as a kid, I got that feeling from Summer of 84. People I watched it with were bored for some reason but I was really hooked throughout the whole runtime.SPOILERS AHEADBe wary; the ending is very, very dark which is in tone with the homage it tries to make.

What I considered unlikeable was the unneeded exposition dumped on us from the actors. Couldn't the filmmakers believe or had a bit more confidence that the audience would know what was going on instead of telling us?
The acting was ok.
I graduated high school in 1984 and the set direction was amazing. The dialogue was a little off. The catch phrase ""I'm out"" when communicating you don't want to be a part of something anymore is more contemporary, but that is nitpicking.

This movie is like watching the first 3 episodes of a show and then it gets canceled. Most likely for cliche writing. ""Bad blood"" was used in a sentence between a cop and a teenager.... If it didn't have the 80's nastalgia no one would take a second look. It poses as a Stranger Things/""It"" type horror film but is really a poor attempt at a thriller that concludes with the most disappointing ending I can remember. Oh wait it doesnt conclude at all and you feel personally attacked. Seriously, if you thought GoT final season was bad, avoid this one, don't listen to people saying it is a good horror/serial killer movie. I could sum the movie up in about one sentence and you could pass an exam on it. Some would argue not all movies follow the same rules, and I would say then watch Green Room and definitly skip this.",Summer of 84

It made me miss my childhood, those awesome summers with friends with no worries to pay bills or the stress of adult life.

Drawing heavily from 80's movies (I feel most heavily from ""Risky Business"".... the way a lot of scenes were shot, the use of narrative voiceover, and the fake Tangerine Dream soundtrack) the first 90% was enjoyable enough. But then clearly they had no idea how to end it, and so the last part is completely incongruent with the rest of the movie and basically ruins everything up to that point. Do yourself a favor, stop the movie at the scene near the end where they are searching the house across the street, and write your own ending in your mind...it will be better than the actual ending (in my ending, the neighbor just disappears and I throw shade on the love interest to make you wonder if they got the real killer).",Summer of 84

A kid is spreading the papers in a suburb and gives one of his neighbours a hand with moving some furniture. As the movie continues he witnesses things that make him think his neighbour is the serial-killer that is all over the news. He tells this to his best frends and askes them to help him prove that he is wright! Meanwhile the cute girl next door, that happend to be his babysitter a few years ago, is noticing him!

Even so, I was captivated by it and I really got into the story, which made me feel nostalgic for some times I haven't even lived.The action develops slowly and gradually, the first part of the movie is less intense, with a group of 4 kids looking for an adventure during the summer break.

Summer of 84 doesn't let their characters to develop at all, it only lets us see a little bit of their personality and the story behind them which I think it ´s not enough for us to care about what could happen to them at all.The stage and clothing it´s great and obviating some moments the acting is as good as it could be. In my opinion, the only important thing that pulls apart this movie of being a good thriller it´s the character development and the unexisting tension or jump scares all across the film.",Summer of 84

This has good reviews.""Wrong. Even when I missed the first 20 minutes of the movie, the rest of it is just plain boring, dragging with characters not having any personality, proper thinking or plan. I tried to focus on the movie, laughed once, but then the weird soundtrack which was very loud at many points annoyed me so badly. But you know what's the most disappointing? The freaking ending. At the last 15 minutes, I thought ""Oh, this is heating up. Cat and mouse is gonna happen. I want some freaking murder."" But then, bam, NOTHING. The movie just ended abruptly, without anything, like anything. I was like ""Really? I waited 1 hours holding myself just for this?

For the first time in a while, I walked away from a movie theatre actually satisfied and my expectations and standards were fully met.If I could sum this movie up in a few words for anyone interested in watching, it would be; A coming of age movie with a similar nostalgic feel of Stand By Me and the Goonies with a thrilling storyline that'll have you on the edge of your seat...",Summer of 84

Its like ST or IT but if they were about fears we must have as children that are all to real.I think I have noticed the director is interested with seriousness and the reality of situations rather than typical movie payoff points. Hence the entire concept of the movie over conventional exciting nonsense. You sometimes are left feeling more like you are actually watching something happen. Movies typically feel directed because they are, but getting performances out of actors that seem so authentic makes it just feel like its an experience.IT doesn't end all wrapped up in a bow, it stays true to what I said the director does.",Summer of 84

It did remind me of stranger things a little but it will because of the kids who I should say are great. A good amount of suspense and jokes keep you going without looking at your phone (this is how I measure things) The ending has a great twist and absolutely not what I expected.

334,gearc,Incredible Nostalgic Thriller,10,14 March 2019,"If you think deeply about the people in your life, are you sure you know exactly who they are? Do you see the real them, or is it all just a mask? Four 15 year old boys ask these same questions as they are set into an intense and dangerous search to find the Cape May Slayer in the movie Summer of '84. This spectacular 2018 thriller uses nostalgia, incredible camera work, a detailed soundtrack, and amazing casting to not only keep you on the edge of your seat, but bring you laughter and tears. Davey has always been fascinated with the mind of a serial killer, so he is absolutely overjoyed when a mysterious man calls the police station and admits to his many murders...and that he isn't finished yet. Davey very quickly grows suspicious of his next door neighbor and drags his 3 friends: Woody, Eats, and Farraday along with him to uncover the truth about this seemingly innocent man. It's like Davey says: ""Even serial killers live next door to someone"", so who can we really trust?Davey, played by Graham Verchere, is our main character, and we soon realize, is the sort of ""leader"" of their group. His character is the most developed of them all. We get a good look into his thoughts as he uses everything in his power to save the town, catch the Cape May Slayer, and keep him from hurting anyone else. Dale, better known as Woody, is played by Caleb Emery and is the classic ""scaredy cat"". They make is it so obvious how incredibly terrified this poor boy is, but it makes him the most loyal of them all. No matter how scared he may be, he sticks by Davey's side. The character ""Eats"", played by Judah Lewis, is immediately portrayed as more of the ""bad boy"". He's known for trouble around town, always has a smart aleck response, and even dresses like a stereotypic ""rebel"". Curtis, who goes by his last name Farraday, is played by Cory Gruter-Andrew. This slightly undeveloped character is an absolute dork. Farraday is awkward and quirky, isn't very open with the other boys, and has the classic glasses and nasally voice. A character that isn't very important in the beginning, but grows in significance is Davey's old babysitter and every boy's crush, Nikki.Probably our most important character aside from Davey is our supposed killer and Davey's next door neighbor, Mr. Mackey. He fits the police stations description, has a suspicious room in his basement, and was the last person seen with the most recent missing boy. Davey is positive it's him, but it definitely doesn't seem like it. Mr. Mackey is charming and kind. He is constantly in a good mood and has a way of making the people around him comfortable. Not to mention, the man is a cop. How could he ever kill so many people? It just doesn't add up. The character development in this movie is incredible. You start to feel like you know every character, just as if you're in the movie yourself. This adds so much to the quality, but this isn't the only thing that makes it great.You've seen the classic and predictable horror movie. We all know how it goes. Group of people are having fun, it's not fun anymore because someone is chasing them, people are stupid, people die for being stupid, and there is always one ""lucky survivor"". On the other hand, we have Summer of '84. Whenever you think you have this movie figured out, something new, strange, and unexpected happens. I was nowhere near predicting the ending, which in a way, adds to the whole experience.One appealing trait of this movie would be it's nostalgia. The reasons I watched this movie is because of the time period is takes place in: the 80s. It's quite clearly stated in the name that the story takes place in 1984, so it had potential. From the coloring, to the clothes, to the cars, to the houses, to the old phones and tvs, etc. It all screams the 80s. I never lived in the 80s but I've always loved that decade. The movie makes you feel as if you were there to experience it for yourself. There is a specific scene in the beginning that stuck with me. The movie starts off with the four boys riding their bikes throughout the neighborhood. It pans from them to what's ahead of them as they ride through the curvy culdesac. We see vibrant colors, old cars, people wandering the neighborhood with their hairstyles and clothes so strange to today's style. A main color that sticks out to me within this scene is the vibrant blue and green.The thought put into the overall look of the movie was so apparent. The soundtrack was perfectly emotional yet chilling. It not only adds to the notalgia, but it also adds to the rollercoaster that is this movie. The arrangement of 45 songs used in this movie were written by Le Matos. A few songs that stick out to me especially is Mackey's theme, PB&J and the Missing Ginger, Serial Killer on the News, and the especially erie track, End of Summer (which gives me chills everytime). These songs all portray the significant synthwave style of the movie, which in turn, reflects the 80s. Even if you don't watch this movie, I would recommend listening just to the soundtrack.The cinematography was detailed in a way that subconsciously fit. Each movement of the camera seemed so natural to the scene. Each shot ranging from close up, to distance, to quick shots, to moving slowly with the characters, etc. It all worked so well together.This movie is a whole wave of emotions. From fear, to excitement, to tears; this movie truly knows how to make you feel something. It uses nostalgia, style, sound, casting, and character development all to make you fall in love with this movie. I can't lie, I was a bit skeptical when first watching, but I can't deny that this has become one of my new favorites. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who doesn't mind a good scare, and of course a pretty sad cry.",Summer of 84

There is no real suspense, the characters feel so lame and unbelievable, it's worse than in a standard slasher movie and that says something.

342,bluepaws-12832,Unexpectedly well done.,10,5 February 2021,"My family and I were looking for a movie to watch and came across this one randomly, switching it on because the description sounded like something we might like. I've watched it multiple times since. Full spoilers ahead.
Beginning the movie I didn't expect much. I originally thought Davey's friends were annoying, but that opinion of mine changed quickly when I found how they really cared for each other and found myself laughing at their jokes. I think the tone shifts between scenes of the boys to the scenes of an innocent teenager talking to a serial killer were so well done. It's something that makes it feel special to rewatch. Mackey being the serial killer was expected the entire movie, but his story was told so well.
The last 40 minutes of the movie had me on the edge of my seat. It felt like some kind of movie that they'd wrap up in a cheesy bow, and in a way they did with the repeating narration and remaking of the first scene. Still, leaving off with this open of an ending leaves people who got invested in the story to wonder what happens to our characters. Does Davey live a long life, or did Mackey fulfill his promise of killing him? Was he able to live a normal life while he had the chance? Did Farraday and Eats eventually forgive him for putting all of them in danger, even getting Woody killed? What happens to Woody's mom? These are just some of the questions racking my brain ever since my first watch.
I wish this movie was more popular, it's commonly compared to the Stranger Things series and the new It movies, but honestly I found that Summer of 84's characters pull you into the story so much more. I was invested in their lives, and watching Woody die in such a disturbing way wasn't easy. Watching Eats cry because of his parents arguing and angrily throwing parts of his treehouse outside was heartbreaking. Watching the boys go from making fun of each other to inviting each other over when times were rough at their own homes made their relationships feel so real.
The implications at the end that Eats and Farraday weren't talking to Davey hurt me so much. I like to think that eventually Eats was able to forgive Davey, since Farraday seemed to be much more neutral. It's the parts like that that make other watchers like me wish so bad for a second movie, but we all know that they ended it like that exactly for these reasons.
Honestly I love this movie. I couldn't recommend it more.",Summer of 84

All the way up to the basement 'investigation' i couldve seen the plot go either way. I was happy however that Davey was right and it didn't just end with ""oh silly kid big imagination, of course he's not the killer"" Mackey finds out Davey is onto him and voila, the 'serial killer' is arrested the very next day by Mackey, who is hailed as a hero. I was like ok kinda coincidental, but still doesn't mean he's the killer. When we find out it is Mackey though, and one victim is rescued thanks to Davey, I thought that was really cool because then Davey is called a hero when nobody wanted to believe him before. Then when you think the movie is over and the killer has fled, he's really been hiding in daveys attic. He drugs Davey and woody and takes them out to the woods to ""play manhunt for real."" I was not expecting poor woody to be taken out like that. Then Mackey catches Davey but doesn't kill him. He says that would be too easy for him. He wants davey to keep thinking about him and wondering when he's going to come back for him because one day he will. I thought this scene was chilling and poor daveys face didn't help. The killer gets away and we don't have closure in that aspect but I think it was done very well. I hope there is a sequel to follow up with davey and catch Mackey. I don't write reviews but the other ones irritated me saying the only positive reviews are from friends or relatives of the people involved in the movie. I'm neither. I came across this on shudder and gave it a shot like so many others and this one really impressed me. I'm a horror/thriller geek and I've seen hundreds and im not impressed often. And for those saying it's just stranger things... Not every movie or show with a group of friends who ride bikes and go on an adventure/try to solve a mystery is stranger things. Stranger things is Sci fi with alien creatures and an annoying kid who can do stuff with her mind. This was a thriller about stuff that happens in real life,unfortunately. Kids go missing, people kill people. Yeah the plot has been done before, rear window, disturbia,but I think the writers took a not so original story line and made it their own and did very well. Even serial killers live next door to somebody... Anything could be happening and you'd never know..",Summer of 84

358,jensbob,Happily surprised,7,1 January 2019,"Never heard of the film before finding it on Netflix, getting intrigued and watching and it was a pleasant surprise. Even though I'm a bit younger than the main characters, It felt right at target as to the eighties feel. The story is a kinda cookie-cutter coming of age thing, but at least to me it was pleasant enough. The serial killer theme adds something unique to the film, and where they take it in the end makes it not end at all in the way I was expecting or how films like this tend to go.*****Spoilers below*****Yes, there where some minor annoyances, the main one was how at the end where they serial killer was revealed but not caught how no one was even a little worried that he might want vengeance. How was the police not watching the main character's house? How did the killer get into the house to hide with no one noticing?I was also kinda annoyed at the parents reaction to the kid's investigation and findings, but I guess there are parents who treat their kids that way. Personally, My kids are some of my closest relatives in the world and like any family member or close friend they deserve my attention and me trusting them, at least if they haven't given me a reason not to. No matter how unlikely it may seem, if someone in my family tells me about something as serious as this it would be extremely unfair and rude of me to assume they made it all up.These things asside, it was an enjoyable film that I'd recommend anyone to watch.",Summer of 84

I kind of got vibes of #robertmccammon #boyslife, #stephenking #thebody, #strangerthings, plus the whole 80's thing.

361,jhill80,Avoid at all costs,2,16 November 2018,"This film was an overly long pile of trash. Cashing in on the retro 80s feel that has recently become en vogue but doing so in such a lacklustre way. Lots of reviewers saying that the last 15 mins ruined the film, I can't disagree more. It was only at that point I got relief knowing that it was all going to be over soon. If you think this movie is any way decent, you need to re-evaluate your life.",Summer of 84

Kinda..Is there some kind of bananas plot twist? No.. We all know that the serial killer is him from the start.. Nothing surprising..Then why the hell i gave this an 8?In my opinion (you can't argue with me when i say ""in MY opinion""), the ending fix the whole movie. Not every story will have a happy ending.
There's a sense of satisfaction in realistic way. 4 kids trying to outsmart a serial killer and expects nothing bad will happen? Come on.. It's realistic that the killer eventually win in the end, also the so called ""protagonist"" was annoying as hell..",Summer of 84

I've tried three times to watch it and it's just awful. Feels like a stranger things rip off without the monsters. Or a talented cast. The main title actors can't hold the weight of the story.

372,cliffyj19,Unoriginal but who cares!!,8,27 August 2018,"No this movie isn't exactly original. It steals plot, music style, characters and sometimes even like for like moments from all your favourite movie/TV sources of this style:
Goonies
Stranger Things
Fright Night
Explorers
Stand By Me
The BurbsBut tbh I didn't care. I loved it it's a fun little movie and great but of story telling that'll never get old on top of which it's 80's heaven without being over the top with the source material as sometimes happens",Summer of 84
373,Fred_Derf_,The anti Stranger Things,8,19 December 2018,"Most manly men, grew up with kid flicks like Karated Kid (true fans will notice the reference), The Goonies or Gremlins, and since a few years it's trendy in Hollyweird to make money with neo 80's material.I didn't like much the neo 80ies stuffs involving kids as main characters I think they failed.From Super 8 to Stranger Things, or even the most over hyped flick of 2017 : Stephen King's It. Hot Summer Nights had some qualities though.And Super Dark Times too, even if this one is set during the 90ies.At last I was pleasantly surprised to watch Summer of 84, lowering my guard as the flick was going on. Not only the production design and photography are nice, but the pre-teens looked real. Felt real. The only kid I've seen earlier was the main character in the fun flick ""The Baby Sitter"". One of them is persuaded that his neighbor Mr Mackey, a cop, is a serial killer. Movie is set in a suburban cul-de-sac
reminiscent of the one in The 'Burbs, you can tell, given the many references to that eighties gem that the three Canadian directors loved it and wanted to pay respect.There are also tons of other subtle references to a lot of movies like The Thing, Nightmare On Elm Street, even the poster is very similar to another Wes Craven flick ""The People Under the Stairs.""So it's low budget but doesn't need a bigger one, you follow the 4 kids spying on Mackey and also live their everydays, life without internet and social network, but with porn mags, talkies and swearing all day. The movie manages to create a fun/ominous atmosphere all the way, and the nice synth wave score composed by Le Matos really helped.If you don't like synth wave you're gonna suffer.Some critics who hated the flick, also called the ending anticlimatic, but I wouldn't use that word, it's an unusual ending but boy, it worked for me. Not your formulaic ending like say, Disturbia. Ironically these critics loved Stranger Things...Which is logic in a way. ST is for pussies.ST is overrated and P.C.
Summer of '84 is the anti Stranger things, and was written before ST became a thing, so stop saying it's a ripoff.The replayability is strong,now I just want a collector bluray with deleted scenes !",Summer of 84
374,shaunhandyjr,This movie deserves to be my first review!,10,1 September 2018,"I really, really enjoyed this movie. At first I was a little bit skeptical due to the fact that it's another teen group 80's nostalgia movie, but it sure blends inspiration from other films and then totally flips the formula upside down. You'll see how they do that! No, I won't compare it to Disturbia or anything like that because Summer of 84' really stands alone here. The vibe, suspense, curiosity, and everything else completely grips your mind to stay focused on what the characters are piecing together, and you just keep wanting more. Here's the thing, I fall asleep all the time while watching movies at night, it just happens. I watched this at 1 am and it literally kept the suspense all throughout and never got boring! It was so interesting to read the characters, guess what they were gonna do, and even relate to them in some ways. Oh, and I can't forget the score! Whoever made it, I applaud them because the score makes those suspenseful scenes extremely eye grabbing and others nostalgia filled. And everybody knows how good that feels. I highly recommend you watch this film, and don't even watch or base it on the trailer, it kinda gives too much away.",Summer of 84

386,jamesjezuit,This Will Sell but Thats All It Will Do,5,22 March 2019,"Summer of '84 struggles incessantly to be its own movie. The music pulled straight from Stranger Things is distracting and out of place. The plot itself is derivative, though that wouldn't be a problem, except it's adds nothing new to the story we are all familiar with.
I found myself checking out during the boys excessively pervy banter and checking back in during the B-story with Nikki, the only clearly flawed character with motivations. The mystery sorrounding the film itself was serviceable but limps its way into a predictable payoff at the end. Aside from a well written speech to our protagonist during the finale, you could have sworn you had seen this ending before. Overall, characters do and say things merely because the 'scriptwriter says so' and I was left just accepting their actions as the film went on without much more than ""oh okay, I guess these people thinks 'this' now."" The film tumbles from story beat to story beat, checking boxes without any meat in between.
Unfortunately, this movie seemed like a first draft of Disturbia slapped together with elements of Stranger Things with no other reason than ""this will sell.""",Summer of 84

Poor script, annoying cast, 70% of dialogues are about boobs, banging each other moms and similar crap.The ambience does not resemble 80'es.After first 10 minutes a viewer already gets the urge to punch the lead actor in the face because of how crappy and annoying he is while delivering no weight to the story development.Music and sound effects are most of the time out of place.

Probably could have shot it in 24p to give it more of a film look, but I see more video all the time. It just struggles in some of the shots with 20+ extras. The end of the story kinda leans into a culture based concept of horror: I am pretty sure Canadians freak out just by the wording alone. For the rest of the film market, it's super awkward (at the end). Could be polished for a sequel, just needs to adopt more horror-standard and not market-specific.

While the story was predictable beyond belief, the characters and settings made it fun and easy to watch, taking in the glorious cheesy soundtrack and the small reminders of my childhood scattered around the various sets. The main protagonist is creepy but as I say, predictable. But it works for this kind of movie. It reminded me of one of my all time favourites ""The Monster Squad at times. The dialogue between the boys was authentic and the acting was on point. A few things to mention are the camera work and lighting, along with the soundtrack that really stood out for me. I loved the dark moody feel that also felt fun and enticing. A great display of good story telling. Overall, although not a horror in any way, this is a good adventure movie to be enjoyed for what it is. A bit of good old fromage.

The soundtrack is amazing, the cast is amazing and it reminds me of the goodies because of how much you care about the characters. It reminds you of when you were 15 and you were playing hide and seek (or ding dong ditching) with your friends. If you like IT or Stranger things you'll love this movie. Some random people give it a 0 or 1 so I'm giving it a 10 to balance out. For this reason I'm giving this a 10 but my real rating is 8.2.

Throw in some of the dumb movie clichees like parents not trusting obvious evidenceabd thus leading to the killing of another child.
Ofcourse, movie tops it all of with feel bad ending (killing the fat kid, and killer escapes).Last scene AKA "" I think that Im an artist cause I and movie with the same monologue I started it"" is kind of perfect because bad movies deserve bad endings.

A scenery was written by Matt Leslie written by Matt Leslie and Stephen J. Smith. It was about finding serial killer by ""ordinary american teenagers"". There is a lot of cliches, for example parents, who don't believe his child,school beauty which starts a relationship with the main character and other. The main difference of this movie is in an unexpected denouement.This movie has similar plot as in ""It"", but instead monster there is serial killer hiding under the guise of a police officer and living next door.

Why did there have to be a completely unnecessary gore scene at the end of the movie when everything else was pretty calm (wouldn't have minded it if there was any before that)? Why did Mackey have such a huge two-story house with a full basement when he lived there all by himself, while making his living only from being a police officer? Why was there no FBI Special Task Force around when a Serial Killer with dozens of victims was on a spree? ...So many plot holes, really did not enjoy this except for the aesthetics, but they pretty much stole all that form Stranger Things (i.e. the Bush/Reagan signs in the front yards, the lighting effects, the synth sounds, the gang of four boys driving around on the BMXs, I could go on for hours...).",Summer of 84
