0,MartinHafer,not exactly my cup of tea,6,13 August 2005,"I like Asian movies--especially Samurai movies. However, this movie and others like it (such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) are NOT exactly my cup of tea. Although the MOST famous aspects of these movies are the matrix-like fight scenes, I can't stand them and think that they really detract from the overall pacing and focus of the film. In other words, if you took away the flying through midair and dancing on the surface of the water scenes, the movie would have scored at least an 8 or maybe a 9 with me. I'm sure that puts me in a distinct minority, but I sure would have enjoyed this movie more if it had stayed with a much more realistic portrayal of the Qin dynasty. If this silly and over-the-top style continues in movies, what's next--lasers and space ships in 5th century BC China?!",Hero
1,TheLittleSongbird,One of the best of its kind,10,20 June 2011,"There have been comparisons to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, these comparisons are perhaps inevitable, some say Crouching Tiger is superior, some say this is superior. I am not going to say which I prefer, both are masterpieces in their own way. The story is very gripping and diverting. While there are the underlying themes of love, betrayal and loyalty, there is one big theme that is explored very well even if a tad surprising, the defence of totalitarianism against the chaos and insecurities of freedom. As good as Jet Li is, as thoughtful the script is, as haunting the music is, as intriguing the characters are and as fine the direction is, it is the visuals and choreographed sequences that make the film. The cinematography is ravishingly gorgeous and the scenery is stunning with each scene more beautiful and inventive than the one before it, and in terms of effective scenes the highlights in my view are the battles in the rain-drenched chess arena and autumnal forest and the midair sword fight above a crystal lake. In conclusion, a beautiful and memorable film and one of the best of its kine. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Hero
2,Leofwine_draca,An overload of wire work scuppers this otherwise well directed historical epic,5,30 July 2016,"I'm the first to admit that I'm not a big fan of wire work. Used very sparingly in the occasional fight scene – so you stand up and think ""woah!"" – I can live with it. But in the likes of this film and CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, the action choreographers always see fit to dispense with the laws of physics and deliver up battles where the opponents soar through the skies, perform impossible manoeuvres in mid-air, and get up to all manner of airborne mischief. I don't mind when there's a reason for the wire work in the film – for instance, SHAOLIN SOCCER used it for laughs and was great; THE MATRIX had a sci-fi premise so I could live with that. But it's my belief that these historical epics would do much better by keeping their actors' feet firmly on the ground. Firstly, it would enhance realism, and secondly, it would enable the participants to get on with the actual fighting, rather than their ballet-style trying-to-look-good antics.HERO's fight scenes are interminable. I'll agree that they are beautifully shot, with the emphasis on lots of bright and vivid colour contrasts, and accompanied by effective 'ringing metal' and screaming sound effects, but at their heart they are hollow, taking place with no rhyme or reason; a lot of the fighters turn out not to be enemies after all, and other fights take place purely in the minds of their opponents. The trouble with this is there's nobody to root for; hell, even in those low budget kung fu flicks of the 1970s, at least the martial arts kid had a reason for fighting the bad guys; they killed a family member, or somesuch nonsense. In HERO, we get silly battles where the characters jump in the tree tops and skim across the surface of a lake. Sure, it's very pretty, but there's no reason for it.The plot is more interesting, in that it's a simple take on the old RASHOMON story of having one tale narrated by multiple characters. Things do get pretty murky and confusing, but they straighten themselves out for the climax, which adds an epic and historical angle to the proceedings that'll make you think ""aaah!"". The film's strength lies in the depiction of the Chinese army, made up of 18000 extras; the soldiers here are more impressive than those CGI guys in TROY! Their method of firing arrows is also very entertaining and the film's best scene has an attack of thousands of arrows soaring through the sky as Jet Li attempts to beat them off. There's also a cool arrow bit at the end which reminded me of G.I. SAMURAI but I don't want to go there too much.Jet Li famously returned to Hong Kong for this film, but he's unfortunately wasted in the role, which could have been played by anyone. He doesn't get an opportunity to act, just to partake in some wire work tomfoolery, and he's barely in the film. Unfortunately, greater prominence is given to unimportant secondary characters like that played by Tony Leung, who is utterly boring – and it doesn't help that I keep remembering the awful GORGEOUS every time I see his face! The best performance comes from an almost ethereal Maggie Cheung, who I thought had vanished into the woodwork since her Jackie Chan days in the 1980s; how wrong was I! This ageless actress may not be a born fighter but her acting is great and a real strength of the movie. She throws the work of the wooden Ziyi Zhang into sharp relief, revealing the latter actress to be nothing but a one-dimensional impostor.HERO deserves kudos for cinematography and sound effects alone. The unusual method of storytelling keeps it interesting, and it's just a shame that the action is so lacking in bite. Had the film offered more meaty battles, it might have been one to watch over and over again; as it is, it works more as a passing curiosity than anything else.",Hero
3,SnoopyStyle,beautiful but story in second half problematic,7,7 December 2015,"China is divided in seven warring states. The ruler of the Kingdom of Qin intends to forcibly unite the states in bloody battles. He is threatened by three elite assassins and has isolated himself. No visitor can approach 100 paces to his throne. Nameless (Jet Li) was orphaned as a child. With no family name, he worked to become the greatest swordsman. He supposedly killed the three assassins and allowed to approach the king. First he kills spearman Sky (Donnie Yen). Then he stokes jealousy between Broken Sword (Tony Leung) and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) with Sword's apprentice Moon (Zhang Ziyi).This is undoubtedly beautifully shot. It's a thing of supreme artistry. The battles are colorful ballets. I like very much the story in the first half. There is a twist that becomes very obvious. Then the second half starts taking more turns. Not all of them are to my liking. I was expecting a different path and I believe a superior path. There are philosophical problems and simple story problems.",Hero
4,claudio_carvalho,Beautiful but Boring and Completely Overrated,5,17 December 2005,"China is split in six kingdoms and the King of Qin (Daoming Chen) wants to unite them. He summons the nameless hero (Jet Li) that killed his three greatest enemies - Moon (Zhang Ziyi), Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) - to visit him in his palace and tell how he defeated the menaces. In the end, the King questions the truth of the story told by the hero.With nomination to the Oscar (Best Foreign Language Film), another twenty-one (21) wins and nineteen (19) nominations including to the Golden Globe (Best Foreign Language Film) and rated top 250#148 in IMDb, ""Ying Xiong"" was a great deception for me. The stunning cinematography and costumes use bright colors and are simply spectacular. The special effects are amazing and the cast has great performance. But there is no plot, and the confused and repetitive screenplay has a very short and low paced story and shows martial arts fights most of the time to complete the 99 minutes running time (including the credits). My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Herói"" (""Hero"")",Hero
5,classicsoncall,"""How swift your sword must be.""",9,21 October 2006,"When I first saw ""Hero"" during it's original American theatrical release, I was mesmerized by the brilliant use of color and exceptional cinematography. I've thought about that visually stunning display for a long time, even after forgetting what the actual story was about. I decided to watch it again for the experience, this time finding my interest intrigued by the complexity of the tale. Perhaps intended for the viewer to arrive at his own conclusions, the sequences as recounted by Nameless (Jet Li) and refuted by the King of Qin (Daoming Chen) are nothing less than spectacular, a work of magic by director Yimou Zhang.In the special features section of the DVD, Zhang relates how he tried for years to find a successful treatment on the history of his subject. Failing, he decided to do the screenplay himself to capture the vision he had of the unification of the warring states. Reading other knowledgeable reviewers' recaps of that history has been enlightening for me, and helps to understand the dichotomy in the motives of the films' principals.Much like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", I like to think of this movie not as a martial arts film, but a film with martial arts in it. Both successfully put behind them the era of action Kung Fu flicks that often seem more caricature than believable, more over the top than entertaining. Political and humanistic considerations aside, ""Hero"" makes for landmark storytelling, handled with deep conviction and reverence by it's creator.",Hero
6,gavin6942,Beautiful Fantastic Film,7,8 January 2015,"A defense officer, Nameless (Jet Li), was summoned by the King of Qin regarding his success of terminating three warriors.This film is very much in the style of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", with the bright colors and flying warriors. The ""dance"" effect is somewhat toned down, but fans of one will no doubt be fans of the other. Plus this one has Donnie Yen, who may be the greatest martial arts actor in the business today.Roger Ebert called the film ""beautiful and beguiling, a martial arts extravaganza defining the styles and lives of its fighters within Chinese tradition."" Ebert knows what he is talking about, and Tarantino was wise to get this film a wide showing in the United States.",Hero
7,lee_eisenberg,Beyond your imagination...,10,23 September 2005,"How to describe ""Hero""? Well, it doesn't suffice to call it an action movie; it's a lot more psychological than that. It tells of how a warrior known only as Nameless (Jet Li) defeated some assassins who sought to kill the emperor. Like many Chinese or Hong Kong movies today, it employs some scenes that previously would have only been suited to fantasy movies. But they do an impressive job with such imagery here. Maybe ""Hero"" could qualify as a fantasy, but it uses so many different methods of story-telling, that you almost can't narrow the movie down to one classification. Zhang Yimou, who continued his fascinating streak with ""The House of Flying Daggers"", made a masterpiece here. You have to see it.",Hero
8,jboothmillard,Hero,8,28 May 2008,"I can't fully appreciate the critics giving this film from director Yimou Zhang (House of Flying Daggers) five out of five, because the visuals are more impressive than the story, but it is a pretty good film. Basically a warrior known only as Nameless (Jet Li) has been called to the palace of the King of Qin (Chen Dao Ming) to recount the tale of how he accomplished an amazing mission, this of course means going to flashback. The King plans to conquer the entire land, and he is targeted by three dangerous assassins: spear-wielding Sky (Blade II's Donnie Yen), and the lovers Broken Sword (Chungking Express's Tony Leung Chiu Wai) with servant (and lover at one point) Moon (House of Flying Daggers' Ziyi Zhang), and Flying Snow (In the Mood for Love's Maggie Cheung). At the end of the story the King notices its flaws, and eventually it turns out Nameless might have something against the King as well. To be completely honest it is mainly the visuals I paid more attention, the wonderful use of vibrant colours, the stunts and over-the-top fights. It was nominated the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. It was number 26 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die. Very good!",Hero
9,ccthemovieman-1,"Spectacular, Stunning Visuals; So-So Story",8,31 March 2006,"After two viewings, I am still not sure what to make of this film, story-wise. I have no problems exalting praise for the cinematography which, for many people, was the drawing point. It's what got me to watch the movie. I had heard it was the most beautiful film ever made. Well, I wouldn't go that far, but it IS visually spectacular. It's even more appreciated now that I watched one of the documentaries in which I learned to what great lengths director Yimou Zhang the crew went to, to make this look so good. It took a lot of patience, waiting for just the right conditions, such as the smooth, silvery lake which only was calm two hours a day.Overall, I didn't think the story was that appealing except for the good message at the end, about the good of all being more important than satisfying one's personal vengeance. Well, who could argue with that? As for the rest, perhaps being a Westerner unfamiliar with Eastern culture, it's harder for me to relate to the mind-set. I would be interested to know how Asians viewed this story, as opposed to similar films.Sometimes I think these wild Crouching Tiger-like action scenes are too long and overdone, but at least in this film they were very original and, once again, more visuals feasts than anything else. On my second viewing, I discarded the subtitles and went with the dubbed version to concentrate more on the stunning look of this film. It paid off. Even if I don't quite follow everything, each scene is such eye-candy that you can't go wrong viewing this.",Hero
10,Tweekums,Absolutely Stunning,8,28 September 2008,"Having seen and enjoyed ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""House of the Flying Daggers"" I wanted to find another film in the same genre so chose this as it shared the director with the latter film. I'm glad that I did watch this as it is a stunning film in many ways; not only is all of the action is beautifully choreographed but every scene looks stunning due to the way colours are coordinated.The film opens with a nameless assassin arriving at a royal palace to be thanked for killing three other assassins that were a threat to the king who has been conquering neighbouring kingdoms. We then see, in flashback, what may of happened between him and the other assassins. Without trying to give too much away we see the way he dealt with them in more than one way, each time what happens is different as his real motivation becomes clear.As mentioned before this film looks stunning and it has many memorable scenes, in particular where Moon (Ziyi Zhang) and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) fight in an Autumnal forest dressed in red robes that match the leaves and a later scene where Nameless (Jet Li) and Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) fight over a lake.The acting and direction are solid throughout, if you like stylised martial arts films then I'd certainly recommend this one. If you haven't seen a film like this before don't be surprised when characters do impossible things like running through the air.",Hero
11,ma-cortes,"Chinese epic with breathtaking battles , baroque scenes and groundbreaking fights using wire work and CGI",7,25 December 2014,"This impressive film has intrigue and action along with magnificent martial arts and breathtaking combats . In ancient China, before the reign of the first emperor , warring factions throughout the Six Kingdoms plot to assassinate the most powerful ruler, Qin who subsequently founded first Chinese dynasty : Qin Shihauing . The king undertakes a bloody , lethal campaign and he is waging war to conquer the entire land . He has been made a target of various dangerous assassins : spear-wielding Sky (Donnie Yen) , Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu-Wai) ,Flying Snow (Maggie Chung) and Moon (Ziyi Zhang) . A defense officer , Nameless, (Jet Li) was summoned by the King Qin (Daoming Chen) regarding his success of terminating three warriors . The King attempts to create an unified China , adjoining states . When a minor official defeats Qin's three principal enemies , he is summoned to the palace to tell Qin the story of his surprising victory .This classic Wu Xia flick displays lots of violence , action filled , thrills and fierce combats . This luxurious martial arts film was marvelously filmed with good production design , fabulous costumes by Emi Wada , luxurious cinematography and breathtaking scenes . It's considered by some reviewers as an ambiguous apologia for state violence but jammed as philosophical arts martial picture . The flick displays spectacular and overwhelming battles with lots of extras including use of arches , arrows and lances . In fact , all of the soldiers in the Qin army sequence as well as the palace sequences were performed by actual Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers, except the stunt performers ; it's estimated that 18000 were used as extras in the film . This is a colourful, China set and expensively budgeted movie ; leave no cliché untouched , though the fighting are magnificently staged . The picture is full of tumultuous sequences with frenetic action , surprises , fierce combats and overwhelming struggles . The lake scenes took almost three weeks to film because director Yimou Zhang insisted that the lake's surface had to be perfectly still and mirror-like during filming . Amid the grandeur of the scenarios and impressive fights is developed an intrigue about the China unification . Maggie Cheung required weeks of training , even Ziyi Zhang, who earned rave reviews with her martial arts performance in Cruching tiger , hidden dragon(2000) needed intensive training to become adept with the twin blades she fights with during many of her scenes in Hero . Colorful and brilliant cinematography by Christopher Doyle , Ziyi's ordinary . Appropriate as well as evocative musical score by Dan Tu ; he is especially known for his work on Crouching tiger , hidden dragon (2000) that won Academy Award and Fallen (1998). The motion picture was compellingly directed by the Chinese Zhang Ziyi who has established himself firmly as a distinguished filmmaker/producer whose last films have generated millions in China box office . Originally released in 2002 in Asia, it would not be another two years until this film was released in the United States . Studio executives were concerned that the foreign-language film would not be successful at the box office with American audiences . Among fans, this is part of the ""Zhang Ziyi trilogy,"" which includes Hero (2002), Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) and House of Flying Daggers (2004) . In all three films, her romantic relationship is ended with the death of either herself or her boyfriend . Zhang Yimou is an excellent and veteran director who in his films often explores the dark side of life in small Chinese rural communities . Most of his pictures begin with the title displayed in Chinese calligraphy style . He has achieved several successes such as ¨Curse of the Golden flower¨ , ¨House of flying daggers¨ , Hero¨ , ¨The road home¨, ¨The red lantern¨, ""Shanghai Triad"" winning several prizes in various International Festivals . And this Zhang Yimou's ambitious historical epic ¨Hero¨ , it has grossed at the Chinese box office to become one of the best biggest release of all time, including American tentpoles , being already the third highest-grossing Chinese film ever, as well as the top grossing Chinese film of 2003 . Rating : Above average . Essential and indispensable seeing .",Hero
12,Quinoa1984,"If you suspend all disbelief you'll like it, maybe even love it, despite some confusion in the film's structure",7,28 August 2004,"Hero, translated here in the states as Ying xiong, is the kind of film that must've seemed either one of the great post-modern epics for their country (called ""Our Land"" the film tells us), or a flamboyant, ultra-dramatized version of the true events. At the least, Hero is helmed by a talented painter of the canvas, Zhang Yimou (responsible for the classic Raise the Red Lantern, a film about repression in Chinese society), who in-between and sometimes during the highly stylized (in the new Crouching Tiger movement of getting the characters flying high in the air as they fight), gives splendorous colors and landscapes, faces, settings, and moods. Along with cinematographer Christopher Doyle, at the least Hero aspires to a technical mastery, and it does work most of the time. By keeping the story in a tale of legend amid what was based in truth, the characters can believably be suited in the palettes Yimou puts them in.What gets the film down, for me at least, is that it's not entirely comprehensible on a first viewing. It may help it to some that it's dense and achieving a level of wonder in the non-linear structure, sometimes I didn't know who was dead and who wasn't, and perhaps in the Rashomon sense it was effective. But to lose track of the story when the technical side is trying to be moving, by default, creates style over substance. This isn't helped by the practically emotionless Jet Li as the ""nameless"" one, and with a constant use by the director of slow-motion in the fight scenes. The supporting cast gets put to some good use, which includes such Chinese film heavy-weights like Maggie Cheung, Donnie Yen, and Zhang Ziyi (the actor who played Broken Sword, Tony Leung, may have been the best out of them from my perspective). And by the end, the story thrusts them into the reign of the tragedy, and it almost becomes like another character, one that isn't completely honed as it should've or could've been.When I walked out of the theater I knew that despite not being all in tune with the story (as it moved around I knew where it was going and not at the same time- a few scenes did make me start to lose interest until the next fight scene came) Hero asks to be seen more than once (maybe both times of cable, no?). On the level of the pure imagination, the film aspires to something it reaches, and it is in and of itself an epic. I just don't think it is a great one. The string sections by Itzhak Perlman are a nice touch, by the way.",Hero
13,dbborroughs,Masterpiece of Cinema,9,3 May 2004,"Say what you will, this film is impressive on just about every level. The only minor flaw, and one thats just annoying me right now so I'm at 9 out of 10 instead of 10 out of 10, is the pacing is just a tiny bit slow. But it will pass as I come to realize what a mistake that was.The plot is simple, a man named Nameless presents to the Emperor the weapons of his three greatest foes, he then recounts how he obtained them.
The visual style of this film puts most epics to shame, regardless of their origin. Since most of the film consists of stories the wire work and flashy action and vivid style only enhance what were are seeing and simply are the way things are.How do you describe this film?You don't you simply hold it out to people and tell them to see it- more so if they like Crouching Tiger since this does what that does but in new ways.Simply one of the greatest films ever made...even if I'm rating it right now as nine out of ten.SEE THIS.Though lets hope that Miramax doesn't completely ruin it now that they are calling it Jet Li's Hero and have trimmed three minutes from it.",Hero

Director Yimou Zhang (House of Flying Dragons, Curse of the Golden Flower) has given us a stunning ballet of China two thousand years ago.The cast includes some of the very best in Chinese movie epics and includes Jet Li (KIss of the Dragon, Romeo Must Die) in his greatest role; Tony Leung Chiu Wai (Infernal Affairs or the real ""Departed""); Ziyi Zhang (Memoirs of a Geisha, TMNT); and Maggie Cheung (2046).Like great opera, this film bears watching over and over.",Hero

Superb cinematography, especially the use of vivid colours.

16,Boba_Fett1138,One of the better modern genre flicks.,7,31 January 2012,"As much as I love old material arts movies, I just can't seem to like any of the modern newer ones. The movies just don't do it for me it all, with neither its story, action or characters. But having said that, this movie still has plenty of value to it. It gets really saved and made interesting by a fine last 30 minutes, or so.I'm just not a big lover of wire fu at all. It makes the action so totally ridicules to watch and totally takes me out of a movie. This movie also has some incredible over-the-top action moments in it, which defies all the laws of psychics and gravity. While most people seem to just love this and are absolutely taken by the visual beauty of it, I'm absolutely annoyed by it. Besided, the action at times suffered from some poor editing, which made it hard to tell at times what was exactly going on.But the action is not just the only problem I had with this movie. It's story was still a much bigger problem for me. The movie is mostly being told in flashbacks but that's not all; it's constantly telling you about the main characters but as you soon find out most of the stories are not true at all and merely a device to confuse the enemy. It's fine if the movie did this once or twice but it constantly keeps doing this. After a while this caused me to not care for the story at all anymore, since I knew I couldn't thrust anything it told me and wouldn't reveal the real truth until its very end.And I admit, when its storytelling became more linear and I started to see what it was all leading up to, I finally got more and more into the movie. It was only then that movie finally became interesting and it was also then that the true motivations of all of the characters finally got revealed. I did not liked that for most part of the movie I had no idea who the good and bad guys and gals were and who I was supposed to feel and cheer for. The movie constantly confuses you with its storytelling and characters. You could call this a good and positive thing but I feel that in this case it worked out unnecessarily confusing and even annoying at times.But still, I see this as one of the better and more entertaining modern genre flicks. Even though the movie annoyed me at times, it also did still entertained me and it really wasn't a punishment to watch this movie. The movie, the story and its actions definitely do have its moments, though I still prefer an old fashioned, Hong Kong, material arts flick over this movie any day.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Hero
17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Delicately put together,8,16 June 2011,"When China was at war with itself and one king attempted to conquer all of it, a nameless man comes to him claiming to have killed the three assassins that have tried to take him out. This shows the Asian love of flowing movement(clothes, hair, leaves), a respect of natural elements and a poetry to the movements and choreography of martial arts. It is beautiful, and at the same time, the action is very cool. There is careful use of slow-motion and close-ups. The story has twists and is thoroughly engaging, and the structure is somewhat like Kurosawa's Rashomon, with the truth being revealed gradually, over time, as different stories are told. This is presented as a legend, and how much of it is true is unclear. That gives it a level of freedom that it uses rather well. Several of the laws of physics take a bit of a backseat to the splendor of the fights(and we get at least one battle that I've never seen equalled). The plot is inspirational, if not everyone will agree with the moral. This has pretty good acting, if Li remains unemotional even when it seems like he should express something. There is a little blood and suggested sexuality in this. I recommend this to fans of the genre. 8/10",Hero

Whereas Crouching Tiger was more of a love story, this movie had that element as well as the element of revenge, nobility, courage, and selflessness. The story was excellent. It was brilliant in its simplicity, and I could see that the writer subscribed to the principal of less is best. The cinematography (if that's how it's spelled) was good as well. The director did a great job with the shots to capture the feeling of the moments. I had to deduct points due to what I felt was overkill on redundancy, plus there were a few slow moments which could have been done without. Anytime I look at my watch then the movie has hit a slow point, and I didn't look at my watch until an hour in.Though it hit a snag, they made sure not to drag the movie on unnecessarily.The movie is only about 90 minutes which was perfect. All in all, I liked it a lot. I didn't want to quite give it an 8 because of a few parts I've seen in other movies, plus other redundancies, so I settled for giving it a 7.Still a must see.",Hero
19,evanston_dad,Visual Poetry,8,29 July 2005,"""Hero"" is a jaw-droppingly gorgeous film that is truly worth seeing for its lush production design alone. Director Zhang Yimou brings a visual elegance to the kung-fu genre film, and a magical realist sensibility to the narrative itself, the results of which are a very violent film where the violence seems to have consequences, and the line between hero and villain isn't so much a line as a vast field of shaded grey.The film is reminiscent of ""Rashomon"" in its fragmented approach to telling its story; one is never sure whether or not the version he is hearing is the truth. That may be because in the world of ""Hero,"" the truth is very open to interpretation--one man's noble act is another man's crime.The film pays its respects to various art forms, all of which are compared to the artistry of swordplay: music, literature, dance. Just as a skilled swordsman can yield nearly unstoppable power, so can the artist impact the world around him.No one will accuse Yimou of being a subtle director, and I do have to say that the continuous fighting gets ever so slightly monotonous. Yimou does a good job of combating this monotony by changing the color palettes and showcasing increasingly dazzling choreography, but when the character of Snow challenges the character of Broken Sword to a duel for what feels like the fiftieth time toward the film's conclusion, I sympathized with Broken Sword when he says, ""Must violence always be the answer (paraphrased)."" Still, this is a minor quibble, and one must also remember that this film is working within the confines of its genre, and that that's just how these films are.Grade: A",Hero
20,Uriah43,An Action Film with Several Twists and Turns,4,24 January 2019,"This picture begins in ancient China during the ""Warring States Period"" which features seven rival kingdoms all competing against one another with the Zhou and Qin kingdoms featured most prominently in this film. As the story unfolds, a warrior known simply as ""Nameless"" (Jet Li) comes to the ""King of the Qin"" (played by Daoming Chin) to report that he has killed the three greatest assassins who threaten the King's life. The warrior then goes on to recount the story during which the King grants certain favors to him as a symble of gratitude with the main concession being to allow Nameless to advance to within 10 paces of him. It's at this time that the King begins to observe some flaws in the story which puts a new perspective on everything. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that viewers of action films will probably enjoy this movie quite a bit as it has that one ingredient in spades. It also has several twists and turns which are certainly interesting in their own right. Unfortunately, as far as the action scenes are concerned, there were a number of preposterous stunts which I thought actually lessened the film's overall entertainment value. Likewise, the manner in which the story kept being recounted-with certain key changes in the process-didn't help that much either. In short, although this film was well received by most viewers, I didn't find it all that entertaining and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly below average.",Hero

This had to be one of the most gorgeous movies to look at I have seen. The use of colors and the locations were just great. As if that were not enough it had a very good and emotional story to go along with it. The first part of the movie contains the most action as there are some good fight scenes plus other visual action scenes. The arrow scene and the fight between the two women in the orchid are both very well done. Then the movie shifts in more of a story mode as things are revealed and sacrifices made. The movie unfolds from different perspectives as the one known only as Nameless tells his story to the emperor. The characters all have some rather cool names as well such as Flying Snow and Broken Sword. The movie is a bit of a sad one, but it works very well. I was also happy they kept it with subtitles rather than dubbing as dubbing can ruin a movie of this sort.",Hero
22,The_Void,One of the best films so far this decade,8,22 December 2004,"Some films are heavy on style and lack substance somewhat, other films have a lot of substance but lose out in the style department. Ying Xiong, however, doesn't lose out in either; it is the perfect fusion of style and substance.The story of the film, is most definitely secondary to the amazing visuals and stunning direction, but it is not incidental; the plot of the movie is also very important. The film is set in ancient China, which at that time was divided into seven kingdoms. The ruler of one of the kingdoms, Qin, has found himself under threat from assassins; the three greatest of which are named Sky, Broken Sword and Falling Snow; stupid names? Indeed. When a young man claims to have defeated all three of these martial art masters, he is summoned to the palace in order to tell the king his story. The way that the plot pans out very much resembles the classic Japanese film, Rashômon; in that several people end up giving their versions of events. The film switches back and fourth from past to present effortlessly, and manages to do it without being convoluted or confusing. The narrative of the film is very well structured in that way, and despite the relative complexity of the plot; the film never becomes challenging for the viewer; but that's not to say it isn't thought provoking either.If someone was to ask me what Ying Xiong was about, I would predominantly say sacrifice. All of the characters in the film sacrifice something, whether it be their love for another character, or their life for the cause that they believe in. Their actions are always explained, and nothing seems out of place or like it's happened by accident, which makes the story flow well and allows the film to be strong in the story department. The thing that will stick out in the viewer's mind once the credits role is without doubt the vibrant use of colour that Zhang Yimou delights in portraying. The fight scenes are spectacularly beautiful; they're well choreographed and extremely aesthetically pleasing. I'm not a fan of the use of slow motion in fight sequences as it detracts attention away from the action, but Ying Xiong manages to use slow motion in a way that it ends up being of benefit to the movie. Most of the time it looks fake, and like the movie is trying to be overly arty; but here it adds to the beauty.Ying Xiong is one a few films released so far this decade that is set to achieve classic status in years to come, and it demands that you see it, if only for that reason. This film is not one that you will want to miss.",Hero
23,zetes,I think this is what God invented light for,10,28 August 2004,"My mind is just so clouded with enthusiasm that I'm not sure I can judge Hero well, but I definitely had the feeling that I was watching a film that would instantly be one of my very favorites. I loved it, every damn second of it, to death. It can be compared to any number of films, directed by any number of directors around the world, but it comes out as something completely unique and amazing. The one reference I would like to emphasize, because I'm guessing that it hasn't been noticed (although I missed every previous conversation in the preceding two years surrounding Hero, and I'm doubtlessly wrong) is this: Hero reminds me a heck of a lot of Alexander Nevsky. Nevsky is a straight-out propaganda piece, aimed towards WWII audiences, and Hero veers late in the film towards a weird theme of Chinese national pride, which is certainly a kind of propaganda. But neither film is too interesting in that aspect, except from a purely historical point of view. Nevsky is constantly misunderstood by modern audiences; it feels archaic, and it's a deliberate archaism. Sergei Eisenstein invented an entirely unique style that, as far as I know, has never been copied. Similarly, Zhang's creativity explodes into something the likes of which I've never even imagined before. Hero is stylized beyond belief, with ridiculous theatrics in one corner, and visuals controlled with a color co-ordination controlled with an iron fist in the other. To me, the nationalist epic intention for Hero is moot. This is the invention of mythology, a mythology that we're never meant to believe anyway, but just to absorb. The complex narrative structure is reminiscent of Rashomon, but I think it's using its idealized, and often lying flashbacks in a different fashion. I'm guessing that some of the film's critics harped on this point, that many of these passionately told stories and miraculously eye-popping set-pieces are in fact invented by the characters on screen. This criticism, I think, is just when talking about, say, The Usual Suspects, but not with Hero. I haven't come close to plumbing the depths of this movie yet  just far too awed at what I saw  but I like the concept of these tragic, mythical heroes having story after story woven around them. For instance, the story of Broken Sword and Flying Snow is told at least four times. Each time, the plot differs slightly, with the events happening a bit differently, but always with the same results, and, more importantly, with the same emotions. It's like these characters are so well known, their story arises spontaneously from their character traits.This film was obviously made on the heels of Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. I absolutely love Lee's film, but Hero surpasses it by miles. I love watching Lee's film, feeling its emotions, watching its startling action sequences, which were so new to me at the time (they still hold up, of course). When I watch CTHD, though, as much as I love the tragic romance and the story of the cocksure teenager, I anticipate the fight scenes. As good as everything else is, the action takes center stage. In Hero, the action scenes are even better, more beautiful, more startling, and more inventive. And they are just the icing on the cake. My one and only complaint about the film has to do with CTHD: the music. It's far too close to the beautiful score of CTHD, almost matching it note-for-note at times. It perhaps should have been much more Chinese. Other than that, what is there left to say? A lot, I expect, but on subsequent viewings. I ought to say that I am in utter disbelief that I was able to catch this at my local multiplex. I was sure that it had been dubbed, though I had not heard that they dubbed it. As far as I know, it is the first foreign language film ever to play at that theater. I was sure I would have to wait for DVD. I wonder if it will stay there more than a week. I wish I had time to see it once a day. Hell, every showing. I haven't slept in 22 hours and I know I'm just babbling now, but I'm pretty sure that I have a new favorite for the current decade (and millennium, while we're at it). Perhaps it is the only recent film that may be able to break into my hallowed top 10. Okay, now I know I'm crazy! 10/10.",Hero
24,JamesHitchcock,All Under Heaven,9,31 July 2012,"""Hero"" is a Chinese wuxia film set during the Warring States Period, the era during the third, fourth and fifth centuries BC when China was divided into several rival kingdoms. The action takes place towards the end of this period when only two powerful states remained, Qin and Zhao. (Pronounced Chin and Chao). The King of Qin has recently survived an attempt on his life by three warriors (two male, one female) in the pay of the King of Zhao, and has offered a rich reward to anyone who can kill the assassins- Long Sky (male), Flying Snow (female) and Broken Sword (male).A minor government official comes forward claiming to have slain the three assassins. (We never learn his name, and he is referred to as ""Nameless""). He produces their weapons to prove his feat, is acclaimed as the ""hero"" of the title and is granted an audience with the king in order to tell his story. We see in flashback how Nameless killed, or claims to have killed, the three. As he recounts his story, however, the king begins to doubt the truthfulness of what he is being told. He begins to suspect that Nameless himself may be an assassin in the pay of Zhao and that the other three may have sacrificed their lives by allowing themselves to be killed, thus allowing Nameless to gain access to the king in order to make his own assassination attempt. The king's suspicions are partly justified, but there are to be some more surprising twists.The film has much in common with two other wuxia dramas from the early 2000s, Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" from 2000 and ""House of the Flying Daggers"", also directed by Zhang Yimou, from 2004. All three films make use of balletic martial arts sequences, often involving the actors ""flying"" through the air on wires. As in ""House of the Flying Daggers"", Zhang makes symbolic use of colour, although in a slightly different way. In ""Flying Daggers"" the whole film, apart from two key scenes at the beginning and the end in which red, pink and white predominated, was dominated by a colour scheme of green, gold and silver.""Hero"" is divided into five sections, each dominated by a particular colour, black, red, blue, white and green. The significance of these colours is that each section represents a different stage in the narration, or a different aspect of the story. Black is used to relate Nameless's fight with Long Sky, a story which is part of his elaborate scheme but which does contain some elements of the truth. Red is used for his account of how he killed Flying Snow and Broken Sword, an account which is later exposed as a total fabrication. Blue is used for the king's surmise about what the true state of affairs might be. Green is another flashback into the past, and white represents the final denouement in which the truth is revealed.Politically, the film has come in for some criticism from abroad. At the end we learn that Nameless and Broken Sword, although both are citizens of the Kingdom of Zhao, have agreed to spare the king's life because only he is capable of uniting China and thus putting an end to the interminable, internecine fighting between the Warring States. The king is revealed to be Qin Shi Huang Di, the man who did indeed unite China and is regarded as the first Emperor. The phrase ""Tianxia"", a key concept in the film, is translated in the English subtitles as ""our land"", a translation which has led some to see the film as a celebration of Chinese nationalism and an implied criticism of Tibetan separatists or the Taiwanese independence movement. It has been claimed, however, that a more accurate translation would be ""all under heaven"", or ""the world"", and that the film is therefore a plea for world peace rather than Chinese unity. There is, however, an implication that peace and stability can only be assured by a strong ruler or an authoritarian system of government, a message which cannot have been unwelcome to the Chinese Communist Party.Despite its tendentious political message, however, ""Hero"" is a fine film. Apart from its physical beauty, it has many other virtues. The plot is an ingenious one, with a complicated, structure, yet unlike some such films it never becomes too labyrinthine or difficult to follow. There is also some compelling acting, especially from Chen Daoming, an actor I had not come across before, as the King. I would rate ""Hero"" on a par with ""House of the Flying Daggers"", or some of Zhang's earlier work such as ""Raise the Red Lantern"". 9/10",Hero
25,=G=,"Think ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""",7,2 December 2004,"""Hero"" is by all accounts a very big if not huge movie with plaudits aplenty from critics and public. The film tells a sort of epic adventure fairy tale about an assassin (Jet Li) and a handful of cohorts who conspire to kill a king which is high melodrama Chinese style and not likely to have a great appeal to westerners. What sets ""Hero"" apart from most other martial art films is the spectacular locations, sets, costumes, music, CGI, and state-of-the-art production value. Lyric, beautiful, and very Asian, ""Hero"" will play best with fans of ""Crouching Tiger..."" who don't mind watching people flying around like Peter Pan while flailing away with their swords.

26,Red-Barracuda,Combines action and visual artistry to spectacular effect,8,11 January 2015,"Set in the Warring States period when China was divided into seven kingdoms that all fought with each other for overall supremacy. An expert swordsman simply called Nameless is brought to the king of the most powerful kingdom, Qin. He has the weapons of the three most feared assassin enemies of the king, all three he claims to have killed. He is allowed access to communicate with the remote leader and from here he tells the stories of his victories.It has to be said at the outset that the primary reason that this film is so successful is its absolutely incredible imagery. The cinematography is simply breath-taking with the cinematic frame used in a spectacularly beautiful manner. Specifically, the use of colour is quite wonderful. Each story segment has its own specific colour scheme that defines it and is utilised to impressive artistic effect. The stories are highly stylised, yet tell a historical story and while the scope often feels epic there is a very personal approach taken much of the time. The characters often express intense emotions and this personalises the events considerably. Like others in the wuxia sub-genre, this one includes many scenes of martial arts performed by highly skilled individuals who glide through the air in gravity defying routines. These fight scenes are filmed with an extreme focus on aesthetics and they are consistently rather beautiful. It's all over-the-top in the most glorious way and, for want of a better description, Hero is the ultimate example of an art-house action movie.",Hero
27,OllieSuave-007,A stunning display of cinematography and action!,7,29 August 2014,"This is a film from Director Zhang Yimou about the King of Qin (Daoming Chen) planning to conquer all six kingdoms under his rule in feudal China, and three warriors plot to assassinate him. However, a prefect named Nameless (Jet Li) claims to have eliminated all three assassins and recounts to the emperor how he did it.The events of the movie's plot are told in different point of views in how Nameless claims he eliminated the warriors to the unraveling of the assassins' plot and the true course of events. This made the story interesting, making the audience eager to know what is truly happening on screen; however, I thought that the overall movie lacks momentum and suspenseful plot points, making the story drag at times - especially during the subplot of warriors Broken Sword (Tony Leung) and Flying Snow's (Maggie Cheung) relationship. The setting of the breathtaking buildings and structures was done in beauty and splendor and the costumes used for the cast were elegant. The sword-wielding fights were thrilling to watch, choreographed beautifully, the acting was dramatic (if a little emotionless at times) and the cinematography was stunning.From another reviewer's viewpoint (thank you aeo) China was a country that was split into several warring feudal kingdoms, and, in the movie, I suppose the King of Qin was trying to unite all kingdoms under his rule for lasting tranquility and prosperity. However, I didn't think that that plot device was emphasized enough in the movie and made it seemed that the King was just one power-hungry evil leader and we were asked to sympathized with the assassins (naturally, portrayed by leading popular Chinese actors Jet Li, Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung, Donnie Yuen and Zhang Ziyi), who I guess were technically supposed to be the real antagonists. ***spoiler ahead*** Therefore, it kind of gave the movie a bummer ending when some of the assassins met a not-so-positive fate. ***spoiler ends*** Overall, though, it's a pretty good historical action film. Grade B-",Hero
28,sddavis63,What Makes A Hero?,7,30 July 2008,"I inevitably compare ""Hero"" to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" because both are Chinese made films, and thus the latter is the only real reference point to which I compare the former. I enjoyed ""Hero"" more than I enjoyed ""CTHD,"" largely because I thought the story was easier to follow. Like ""CTHD"", ""Hero"" is filled with beautiful photography, brilliantly choreographed martial arts scenes, and excellent stunt work and special effects. That latter strength, however, is ironically one of the weaknesses I found with both movies. While I'm sure it's a cultural issue, I find the flights of fancy in the martial arts scenes distracting, as people soar through the air and walk on water. To me, that lends an air of unbelievability to the fight scenes, which should be the heart of the movie. Instead, they just come across as fantasy. In this case, though, a very good story helps overcome that problem.The story is set during the time when the ruler of Qin sets for himself the goal of unifying various warring kingdoms and creating a unified nation, which would become China. To do that, he has to overpower the strongest of his enemies, the neighbouring kingdom of Zhao. Zhao is powerful, and has three assassins constantly trying to kill the king, until one day, a low-ranking official named simply Nameless (Jet Li) is brought to court after apparently having defeated all three assassins. He weaves a story to explain how he accomplished this, but the king is suspicious and offers what he believes is the real story. Both stories are told through the use of flashbacks.In the end, as the title implies, we deal with the question of what constitutes heroism. Who is the hero here? The unknown official who apparently vanquishes the assassins? The assassins themselves, fighting for the very existence of their nation of Zhao? The king who understands that the constant warfare and suffering of the people can only be stopped by the even more ruthless warfare required to unify the country? There are a variety of possibilities. It's an interesting story - and an interesting moral question about war and violence. 7/10",Hero
29,Buddy-51,A Stunning Work of Art,9,12 November 2005,"The Hollywood action crowd could learn a thing or two from ""Hero,"" a martial arts picture that tells a complex story to go along with its fight scenes and generates one unforgettable image after another.Set in the period before China became a united kingdom, ""Hero"" deals with such classic themes as courage, self-sacrifice, honor, revenge and romantic passion, and does so on a scale that is both intimate and epic. In this tale about the founding of a nation, the protagonist is a master swordsman, known only as ""Nameless,"" who is either an assassin of other would-be assassins who are out to kill a king, or an assassin bent on killing the king himself. The beauty of the story is that it unfolds in the form of a mystery, almost ""Rashomon""-like in the way it views the same incidents from the differing and often contradictory perspectives of various characters, some of them eyewitnesses to the events and others spinning tales out of pure speculation. Like the images in a kaleidoscope, the plot points are constantly grouping, then falling to pieces, then re-grouping into other patterns until a full-blown picture of the entire story at last emerges.The kaleidoscope analogy is a fitting one, for it is in its visuals that ""Hero"" truly becomes a masterpiece. The film is like an artist's canvas brought brilliantly to life, a canvas covered with the most vivid and eye-popping colors imaginable. Whether it's the sight of huge armies marching against impressive landscapes, their flags of war fluttering in the breeze, or thousands upon thousands of arrows soaring through the air in a literal rain of death, or a beautifully choreographed fight scene in a meadow strewn with impossibly yellow and red autumn leaves, ""Hero""'s imagery makes an indelible impression on the viewer. As is the custom with many recent Chinese films, the swordfight scenes have been turned into slow motion ballets, with the participants defying gravity by flying effortlessly through the air to unimaginable heights. This emphasis on the surreal gives the film the mythic quality it needs to tells its ancient tale.Yet, even with all its visual sumptuousness, ""Hero"" never forgets that it is, first and foremost, a story about people - their lives, their loves, and the conflicts they face as they play out the roles assigned to them by history. Rather than getting buried under all the visuals, the characters are able to stand out from the background and make their mark on the viewer's heart. This is helped immeasurably by the fine performances from Jet Li, Tony Leung Chiu Wai, and Maggie Cheung among others.Kudos to writers Feng Li and Bin Wang, director Yimou Zhang, cinematographer Christopher Doyle, costume designer Emi Wada and all the other talented artists who have had a hand in crafting one of the most visually exquisite and intellectually satisfying films in recent memory. American movie makers please take note!",Hero
30,cherold,wow wow wow wow wow,9,5 January 2006,"Hero is a movie of wow moments. In fact, the movie seems to have been designed with the goal of making the viewer go ""wow"" about once a minute. Much of this is achieved through the film's amazing visuals. While ostensibly a martial arts movie, this is really closer to a dance film, with whirling, colorful principals leaping and soaring in impossible ways. The movie is cinematic in a way few movies are, and is basically the movie I was expecting to see after hearing about the disappointing Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.The film shows the sort of mastery of pure cinematic film making of someone like Kubrick or Kurosawa, although the style is dissimilar to both. The director has an unerring feel for both pure visual composition and for the beauty of movement.Wow moments come both from stunning sights like a woman spinning so quickly that arrows are pushed away and cool ideas like two opponents facing each other as they quietly imagine the fight they will have as a musician plays. The movie elicits a pure visceral wonder, the sort that makes people shout out, ""Awesome dude, that is way cool!"" There's not much actual story and the film certainly never pulls you in the way Roshomon does (a film some have compared with Hero, although it's a very superficial similarity). But the film is so stunning from one moment to the next that I really don't care about any deficiencies of plot.

31,paul2001sw-1,Stunning but empty,6,10 July 2008,"The Chinese historical drama is a well defined genre, complete with fly-by-wire swordplay, and 'Hero' is a fairly typical example of the breed. It's beautiful, but stylised to the point of near-ridiculousness: it's maybe better to think of it as ballet than fiction. What is unusual about this movie is the plot, which is little more than a formal construct, and its nationalist ethic: this is a story about the foundation of China, although ""story"" is pushing it, and the film is full of epigrammatic symbols that hint at profoundity but which may just be empty. I liked watching it, but at some level, it wouldn't have been so different an experience to view it without the subtitles, so limited is the substance.",Hero
32,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"A feast for the eyes that, ultimately, ends up being mostly empty calories.",5,18 June 2018,"There's no doubt 'Hero (2002)' is lavish, with opulent production design decorating sometimes upwards of eighteen-thousand period-dressed extras and elaborate fight choreography coming up in almost each and every scene (whether or not it's honestly needed). However, all of its splendour tells a tale that essentially amounts to very little other than thinly veiled pseudo-propaganda (though an argument can be made for full-blown propaganda) that paints one of China's past ruthless dictators as a misunderstood 'hero'. No amount of overindulgent excess can fix that or do anything towards making you care about the admittedly impressive visuals you're seeing. All it does is drive the budget through the roof. This was - at its release, at least - China's most expensive motion picture and, while it certainly shows in the scale of the scenery, it isn't reflected by the scope of the story. It's not like the movie is particularly bad. The action-sequences are usually quite breath-taking, using their literal 'story' nature to 'make sense of' - or otherwise solidify - and accentuate their slightly fantastical nature. They often fall into a place of total inconsequence, though, with some being entirely invented even within the possibly invented narrative in which they appear. They also usually lack the weight to make them feel tangible, impactful or properly consequential. This is something not helped by the fact that we know how most of them turn out, due to the poorly acted framing device. This actually acts as more of a limitation than a unique way to tell the tale. It does allow for various perspectives to be placed upon similar events, which are portrayed with varying colour schemes to initially unnoticed but ultimately appreciated effect, but doesn't allow for enough divergence within the narrative and neuters the possibility of anything having any real consequence until the movie catches up with itself. Once it does, its message becomes even more confused and more likely to inspire an eyebrow being raised than the swell of pride that's intended. By this time, the poor pace of the piece has become grating, to the point that the previously somewhat awe-inspiring fight-work has become kind of a chore to sit through, which, perhaps strangely, makes the ending feel less definitive than it actually is. This is really because there isn't a sense of structure, no proper finale outside of an uncharacteristic choice that only serves to pander to the movie's agenda, as opposed to the natural direction of the character's intentions. There are some slightly resonant themes stuck in there, though, even if you have to read past some pretty operatically iffy outside elements to get to them. In the end, the film is much more impressive from a visual standpoint than a narrative one. Even this doesn't hold up, though, because you don't really care about the characters and, as such, can't stay fully engaged throughout. 5/10",Hero
33,dromasca,one of the best movies in its genre,9,2 July 2004,"'Hero' is one of the best movies in the genre of Asian historic and martial art films, and one of the best movies that I saw lately. The story line is quite familiar to the fans of the Chinese and Japanese film fans - a mix of legend and history from the far Chinese past. We have seen it many times especially in Japanese movies. What is different and special here is the smart use of flashbacks in the story, re-creating and re-discovering the story with new twist every time. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful, one of the best I have ever seen. The fight scenes are good - I am not a big fan of the human flying effects that reign in the genre in the last ten years, but the fight scenes in this film are more than just physical fights, they are confrontation between the characters, melt in same as the dialog ad the rest of the action. The moral of the story makes sense, and is beautifully translated in cinematographic language. I also like the atmosphere of Oriental mystic - certainly commercial, but at least coming from the real source. Indeed, China is the source of some of the best cinema in the last years.

35,TheMovieDiorama,Hero is a visually arresting martial arts classic.,9,9 March 2018,"It's not often I say ""classic"" for this genre, there are certain milestones. Much like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon back in 2000, Hero became popular in western audiences due to its easy accessibility and minimal dialogue. This film is absolutely gorgeous. One of THE most beautiful, stunning, majestic cinematic pieces ever conceived. The use of colour is so extraordinary that me attempting to describe it won't do it justice. Whole scenes are built on colours. Costumes, production design, the environment...all based on one colour. An example would be the fight scene in the woods where all the leaves and trees are autumnal, the costumes are shades of red. Then later on in the scene, the shades of yellow and brown transition to red seamlessly and it is just so damn beautiful. If a scene takes place in a desert then everything is presented as yellow. How about in the King's palace? The interior design, armour and costumes are black. It's not even subtle, so you will notice it but it's entrancing and makes the experience ever so hypnotising. The film is about a Nameless warrior retelling his eradication of three assassins to the King, but not everything is as clear as what he says it is. It's an intriguing narrative, if I were to dive into it it would spoil the plot. But there is a point where we have a flashback within a flashback (flashbackception?) so that should give you a clue regarding the linearity of the plot. Important themes are explored such as the similarities between idealism and love, how one can kill or be willing to die for an ideal or love. Excellently acted by Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung, two assassins who are embroiled in a complicated love affair. Donnie Yen and Jet Li are there to provide the amazing action. A martial arts classic is not without its action, and Hero is damn full of it. The choreography is rapidly insane...how can anyone comprehend the speed at which these guys fight is beyond me. Just...watch this. Please, it's so good.",Hero
36,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Beautiful action and a unique tale of heroism,9,1 January 2009,"In the east, specifically in China, war and fighting is art. To love many Chinese movies, you must have an open mind toward appreciating that idea, and to enjoy ""Hero,"" you really have to be fond of it. The fight scenes are like paintings, the fighting choreography like ballet--if you can't take interest in that, well ""Hero"" can get a little boring or redundant at times, but overall, it's a film that attempts to uncover what truly makes a hero.The film stars martial arts master Jet Li as Nameless, a hero who comes to the king of Qin in China to bring him the weapons of three fallen would-be assassins, knowing their is a high reward for them. The king is more interested, however, in knowing how Nameless managed to bring down three of China's greatest warriors, so through a series of flashbacks, Nameless tells his story in effort to convince the king of his accomplishment and trustworthiness. With good reason, the king is wary of Nameless' intentions.It's not a surprise that Quentin Taratino has his name attached to ""Hero"" because of its similarities to ""Kill Bill,"" at least in structure. There are various fights between Nameless and assassins Sky, Broken Sword and Flying Snow. Each fight seems to have some sort of visual theme to it. When he fights Sky in the earlier portion of the film, rain is the theme and various shots are meant to give the fight a completely unique look and feel from any fight you've ever seen before in film. One fight between Flying Snow and Moon, Broken Sword's servant played by Zhang Ziyi of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" takes place in a forest with pedals of dazzling bright colors blowing about. Color is a particular focus of director Yimou Zhang. In each series of flashbacks the costumes are a specific color as is the general color palette. It really adds some visual distinction to the film.Most surprising is how well the film manages to communicate the idea of what it means to be a hero. Is a hero one who avenges and uses a sword? Or is he something greater? In the historical context of pre-unified China and rival provinces, it's particularly interesting to consider.",Hero
37,Anonymous_Maxine,Better than the hype would have you believe.,10,13 January 2005,"There are times when movies are released amidst enormous publicity and excitement and turn out to be average or even below average movies, and there are times when movies are released almost completely unnoticed and turn out to be milestones, and most rarely, there are movies that are released surrounded by great expectations and huge amounts of hype, and turn out to be even better than they were built up to be. Hero is, you might say, a close encounter of that third kind. Jet Li, whose startling martial arts capabilities have wowed audiences since Lethal Weapon 4 (and for years previous to that, before he achieved international stardom) has officially passed Jackie Chan, I should think, in American favor, which only a year or two ago may have seemed impossible for anyone to accomplish. Both men have released countless martial arts movies over the last decade or so, but it seems to be Jet Li who has been taking his craft more seriously.Of course, both men are incredibly skilled martial artists, but Jet Li has taken his craft in a completely different direction than Jackie Chan. While Jackie Chan's comedies are not less skillful than Jet Li's, they are certainly less dramatically moving. Jackie Chan's fighting style is much more conducive to comedy than Jet Li's, who fights with such captivating style and skill that he is much better used in hardcore action films where he's a closed off weapon, a genuine force to be reckoned with. Jackie Chan uses his skills to entertain people, and despite such flops as Romeo Must Die, Jet Li seems to want to do more with his craft. Hero, for example, is told through a series of flashbacks, as Jet Li in the present tense spends the vast majority of the movie on his knees before the king.The photography in the film is some of the most impressive I've ever seen in a movie, and embodies all of the things that I love about Japanese film-making. The lengthy shots and slow action during the scenes between Li and the king remind me of some of the best works of Kurosawa, while the stunning artistry of some of the fight scenes, many of which are given a color and display it with incredible prevalence and beauty, are so amazing that even someone who simply cannot accept zero-gravity in kung-fu movies (I have a bit of a hard time with that myself) can appreciate them. They take martial arts to a whole new level even beyond that seen in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.Posing as a messenger who has brought news to the king of an intricate plot to kill him, which he himself has stopped by dealing with the assassins personally, Li is granted unprecedented access to the throne, which no one has been able to approach closer than something like 100 paces for years. But the king is so impressed with Li's story that he rewards him by granting him permission to approach to within mere feet of the king. Gradually, it becomes apparent that Li, whose character in the movie is nameless, is one of the assassins himself, and has created this story with the help of the other assassins in it in order to win that very access to the throne. The king's realization that he has granted extraordinary royal access to an assassin is impressive indeed.But here is where the movie really gets powerful. Beyond the fight scenes, which are staggeringly remarkable both in their size, the way they are photographed and edited, and the way they are fought, the story thus far is impressive but fairly simple. But the movie has something to say about revolution, because Li has come within paces of the king, and both know that he could easily kill him, but he doesn't. He stands up and walks away, leaving a message immeasurably more powerful than if he had killed the king. Another king would have been brought in, Li would have been ultimately killed by the guards, who would arrive too late to save the king and may suffer some casualties themselves, but in the end he would be killed.The important thing is that another king would be brought in to carry on the legacy of the fallen king, this time maybe with tighter security. But because Li came close enough to kill the king but stood and walked away (to his death, as it were), that king will go on ruling with Li's accomplishment in the back of his mind for the rest of his life.I could kill you right now, but I'm not going to because I've beaten you already. My job is done here.THAT is a message to an infallible dictator that is far more powerful than any measure of violence could ever be.",Hero
38,Vartiainen,Visual splendor mixed with intriguing storytelling,8,14 February 2014,"Director Zhang Yimou is a household name among wuxia fans. He's the maker of such films as House of Flying Daggers and Curse of the Golden Flower. From his more recent efforts I remember The Flowers of War the best. But this here is his magnum opus, his grandest gift to cinema.Hero is a confident film. It opens where most movies would end, with the protagonist presenting himself to the emperor to receive his rewards. And from there the story is told almost solely through flashbacks. An intriguing choice that would condemn a lesser of film, but Zhang makes it work. A lot of that has to do with the storytelling device where the exact same story is told over and over again, but every time this happens, it's told slightly differently. This beautifully emphasizes the importance of viewpoint as well as existing prejudices and expectations when either telling a story or hearing one.And even then it would have gotten pretty boring, with the exact same actors going through exact same routines, but the cinematography is so well designed that the every time we return to a familiar scene, it feels different, and not just because it plays out with slight variations. The colour scheme is always drastically different, the layouts have changed a little bit (yet the settings are always identifiable) and even the score seems to underline the moods in new ways.It's a fascinating film to watch and it always keeps you guessing until the very end. It speaks of richness of its characters that at the final scene I had no idea what the protagonist was going to choose. Not because his character was too unpredictable, but because I understood his blight and the difficulty of the decision. I also appreciate how well the film understands the underlying ethos of any martial art worthy of the name: the fact that you learn to fight in the hopes that you'll never have to.If you have any love for wuxia films or Chinese culture, or if you'd like to see a story told in a way you've rarely seen, you owe it to yourself to watch this film.",Hero

When it is discovered to be a lie by the Emperor, the same story is retold from the Emperor's deduction and reasoning. After the truth is out about the facts surrounding this story, it is told yet AGAIN as the ""true"" story.I'm sorry, but even with the eye candy to keep the ""eye candy whore"" inside me entertained, the story was still so dry and boring that I honestly wished I had gone to see AvP again, instead. This work, frankly, tried too hard to be stylish and ""artsy,"" but as far as I'm concerned, it was neither.Perhaps it was my personal mood at the time, as everyone else here seems to have loved it.

I've seen it twice; this is the most delicate and beautiful of what I call the ""art house"" martial arts movies (i.e., ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""House of Flying Daggers""), and I'm simply amazed at the film's production, cinematography, fight scenes, and of course, Jet Li. Li is the most talented martial arts superstar the movies has seen since Bruce Lee. Li plays Nameless, a wandering magistrate who, as the film opens, entices the imperialist King of Qin (Daoming Chen) with a story of how he single-handedly defeated three assassins who had each vowed to kill the king. Much can be said about the film's fight scenes, which are beautiful and are amazingly choreographed, but the biggest problem, I think, lies within the story. I had to sit through the film two times before I felt I could get a grasp on everything, but maybe it's just me. The movie sometimes tends to meander through some of its slower parts and that could take points away from an otherwise excellent film. But as I stated before, the fight scenes are magnificent, the standouts of which come to include a fight between Nameless and Sky (Donnie Yen) that takes place inside a chess house, and the two float and practice their swordsplay as a blind man plays music during periods of when nothing goes on between the two men, and they just listen to the sounds as the man plucks away at the strings. And there is another scene where Nameless battles Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) over the serene mirror of a mountain lake, and the two men are careful to not break the water's surface. An excellent and delicate film.""Hero"" - 8/10",Hero

42,drqshadow-reviews,Lyrical Cinematography Keeps Pace With an Ambitious Tale,10,11 September 2011,"During China's ancient ""Warring States"" period, a solemn warrior appears at one royal palace bearing gifts: the collected weapons of three notorious assassins, whose prior attempt on the king's life did not succeed. Now paranoid due to the attack, the monarch sits alone in his throne room, not even his advisors allowed within a hundred paces, but allows this steady-eyed visitor to draw near as he tells his story. What follows is an act in three parts - two hypotheticals and a truth - that describe identical topics through biased eyes. We see fact stretched into fiction, though the telling is so sweeping, vivid and resonant that we often overlook the context clues.Director Zhang Yimou's vision is breathtaking, an intricately detailed work of moving art that blends seamlessly with the romantic martial arts epic at its core. Fabricated memories take on a dreamy quality, reflecting the speaker's sweeping exaggerations. Fight scenes flow like syrup, a poetic ballet of impeccable fighting stances and wuxia acrobatics. Environments pulse with life and color. The lush, mesmerizing golds and reds of a leaf-coated orchard during autumn, perhaps the most memorable setting in a film that's absolutely stuffed with them, still leaves my jaw agape.A strikingly gorgeous film, crafted with expert care, that's equally profound on a thematic level as it is on a compositional one.

43,Chris_Docker,A visual feast,9,3 October 2004,"Perhaps the most visually beautiful movie of the year. This epic tale of moral dilemmas, heroism and the legendary and supernaturally gifted swordsmen of the warring states before the unification of China, leaves you gasping with the sheer audacity of the artistry. The only real connection with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (which I'm afraid I personally found a little tedious) is the use of stunning imagery and landscapes to make, I suppose, what was traditionally a male-dominated film market - boys doing battle - appeal to women as well. But the similarity stops there - Hero is about moral paradoxes, self-sacrifice, difficult questions of leadership - but all handled in a sublime panorama of visual extravagance. A nameless official challenges the evil ruler. His skill in swordsmanship has been aided by the study of human relations, of calligraphy, of numerous other arts. We travel across China - the Viet-nam-like tropics with strange mountains, barren plains, breathtaking mountains, colossal palaces. The characters dress in a way that gives further clues as we see the story from different sides - green, yellow and red all having different symbolism. The one jarring factor is the dubious political message which smacks of justification for totalitarianism - with not only a wink to modern China but also to the United States and its expansionist foreign policy and the sort of justifications that Bush type administrations use. The film has possibly meddled with history in terms of the main characters and their actual moral fibre or real motives. In what has become a legendary injustice, the Disney/Miramax empire did not released Hero in the USA until February 2004 - fourteen months after it was released in Hong Kong, and a full year after it received an Academy Award and Golden Globe Nomination for Best Foreign Language Film of 2002 (a fact not highlighted in the promotional trailers and posters very much).",Hero

45,kluseba,"An intellectually, philosophically and visually challenging masterpiece",9,20 July 2016,"""Hero"" is one of the very best wu xia movies since the beginning of the new millennium. This movie isn't just recommendable for fans of Chinese period movies but for anyone who admires creative cinema.Zhang Yimou's masterpiece convinces with an unusual story line. The movie focuses on the mysterious meeting between a prefect who claims to have defeated the empire's three most dangerous assassins and the careful, clever and philosophical emperor himself. The first third of the movie explains the prefect's version of the story. The second third focuses on the emperor's analysis of the story. The last third finally reveals what really happened.If you think that the movie might be repetitive because the same story is told from three different perspectives, you are wrong. Each story builds upon the previous version and only adds new elements. This unusual structure adds a mysterious and even surreal vibe to the movie. This film comes around with a few clever twists and turns but the epic conclusion reveals everything the viewer needs to know.The mysterious and philosophical message and vibe of the movie is supported by one of the best cinematographies ever done in cinema. Zhang Yimou works a lot with different colours and their meanings such as white for innocence, red for passion, green for hope, blue for dignity or black for darkness. The different settings and landscapes also add to the movie since key scenes take place inside a bare palace that represents isolation, a blue lake that represents spirituality or a hot desert that represents loneliness. The settings and costumes are in perfect harmony with the slow and precise camera work and a calm and spiritual soundtrack. The fighting scenes blend in very well and have a surreal touch where mental strength is much more efficient than physical power. The different characters are flying through bamboo forests or over peaceful lakes and are constantly using their natural surroundings to fight their opponents. This movie symbolizes the harmony of men and nature, underlines the efficiency of mental strength and delivers a message of community and peace where the greater good for an entire empire is more significant than the fate of a single person, family, location, race or ideology. These messages are delivered in a mostly grounded and intellectual way and only the final scenes feel a little bit melodramatic and slightly pathetic.In the end, ""Hero"" is much more than a simple martial arts movie. It's one of the most intellectually, philosophically and visually profound movies of the new millennium. This film has a heart, soul and different messages that are at least interesting to analyze, empathize with and understand no matter if you end up agreeing or disagreeing with them. Anybody who considers him- or herself intellectual should have watched this unique masterpiece.",Hero

47,Enchorde,Epic and beautiful,6,10 July 2005,"** HERE BE SPOILERS ** Recap: Qin is fighting to unite China, which is divided in several small kingdoms. However, not all small kingdoms that are about to be conquered is really happy with that. So Qin has to live with several attempts on his life, and has taken extreme precautions to stop the assassins. Now one soldier has killed two of the most known assassins and is about to be rewarded by the king. The reward is stated by the law, gold and land and a toast a mere 10 steps away from the king (compared to the 100 steps one should normally consider). As the king and the soldier are about to toast, the soldier is asked to tell the story how he defeated is adversaries, known to have great skill. He tells a tale full of wit and cunning, skill with the sword and martial arts, and of love and betrayal. The king listens but senses that there are more to the story, not all has been told, or if the truth has been told...Comment: A very beautiful movie with sharp contrasting colours in beautiful schemes. Large pieces of fabric accents and hides movement. Also the landscapes and scenery chosen for the movie are very dramatic and beautiful in itself. Together with the use of large armies this is truly a epic movie. However spectacular the battles and fights are, they are not the main focus of the movie. The focus are on the conversation between the king and the soldier, and on the story itself. What really happened, and why? So far, all is well. Then there is the decision on if you like this type of spectacular fights with skills that allow the combatants mind boggling speed and incredible jumps and so on. I don't. To me, they're more like choreographed dance than fights (yes I know that fights in movie are more or less choreographed, emphasize dance here). Sure, they are impressive and in a way fun to watch, but they're dances, too implausible to be exciting as fights. This actually lowers the tension and suspense in the movie, the fight scenes actually becomes pauses to relax in instead of heightening the suspense or thrill. This might have been intentional, what do I know? For me it is unfortunate. Still the movies should be seen, preferably in original language.6/10",Hero

Jet Li's performance in the film didn't really leave a lasting impression, which to me, is the only reason why the film doesn't get a 10. He was great in the action scenes, but unfortunately, his character was far too one-sided. However, I did like the portrayal of Broken Sword and Flying Snow, for they were really the heart of the film and gave the movie its lasting impression. People will credit the action and the audacity, but the movie was really came together in the editing and production design. Without those two elements, the film would have been just another Crouching Tiger knock-off. Also, the musical score created by Tan Dun was incredible, mixing in with the fighting and the sound design to make a deep and layered experience.But the real question is, how will this film be remembered? History buffs will certainly like, and fans of Asian film will find it interesting. To me, the potential for this film has yet to be seen, and I hope it is considered a classic of martial arts and art intertwining perfectly.",Hero

It's filled with great performances, fantastic use of colour (particularly black, yellow and green), many memorable action scenes and a twisting flashback plot line incorporating Chinese pre-history, assassination and a great thought-provoking theme of personal sacrifice for the greater good. Yimou - previously known mostly for laudable but kinda stuffy period-pieces like Raise The Red Lantern - does an amazing change of pace and turns in a top-notch action flick. The two main sequences featuring Flying Snow (Cheung, a stunning actress and martial-arts veteran) - defending a calligraphy school from an endless hail of arrows and a swirling swordfight amongst a whirlwind of leaves - are unmissable, a triumph of choreography and effects, as is an amazing waterfight scene, and all are rendered without overt violence and bloodletting. The four leads - Chinese Li and Chen and Hong Kongers Leung and Cheung - are all fabulous. Terrific stuff all round, although it takes itself a bit too seriously sometimes. A superb Chinese production, distributed in Europe and the US by Miramax. Shot in great desert/forest locations, with first-rate photography by Australian cameraman Christopher Doyle.

50,truemythmedia,Martial ART!,8,27 February 2020,"""Hero"" blew me away when I first saw it in my early twenties. I was beginning to explore foreign cinema for the first time and martial arts was my first love. The way the action was shot, fights were beautifully choreographed, and the values of the culture differed from my own all drew me to explore films which would eventually push me into foreign films from all over the world.For the time, however, ""Hero"" was simply an action movie out of step with the movies I had grown up with and accustomed to. I was too young to understand some of the political realities that affect the story and the film's production so subtleties of a communist country influencing a story to make it more palatable to the official narrative were lost to me.I liked the martial arts. I liked the use of color. I liked the simple narrative subversion and the nobility of the characters all around. I hadn't seen a lot of Martial Arts movies yet but it seemed like they were mostly about one school or training style versus another or about personal revenge. Here was a film about large military conquests that was all boiled down to the battles between champions and a plot to assassinate a brutal conqueror. More my style.As the action and story unfolded, I missed the subtleties at play in the characters. I was young and still thought love was somehow magic and couldn't understand how a character could love someone but then go against them for ideological differences. I hadn't faced those battles in my own life and so didn't realize that this is the most interesting drama in the film. The fights may be beautiful, subtle and born from deep internal emotion but I was missing that part of the equation until this last viewing.Re-watching it, I was still impressed by the use of color to represent different seasons, emotions, and even versions of accounts of the same events but not like I was when I was younger. The same goes for the choreography which looks a fair bit more like dancing than fighting to me at this point. The real difference is my latest viewing is that I am more experienced in the hardships, arguments, bonds, and broken loves of life than I was. Now these fights seem less like interesting backs and forth which keep me on the edge of the seat wondering who will win and how. These questions are all fairly predictable in this film.No. The fights in ""Hero"" are the emotions. Do you want to see what pain looks like? Resolve? Respect? Watch the way Jet Li (""Fearless"" 2006), Tony Leung (""Chungking Express"" 1994), Maggie Chow (""In the Mood for Love,"" 2000), Donnie Yen (""Ip Man"" 2010) and Ziyi Zhang (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" 2000) fight in this film. The fight is not to answer the question ""What happens next?"" It is to answer the question ""But how do they really feel.""The communication and sharing of emotional experience is core to the art of cinema. ""Hero"" excels in bringing these experiences into our lives with a style that is luscious yet minimal, fights that are frenetic yet peaceful, and heroes who kill yet are willing to die for their enemies.",Hero

53,rosscinema,Film offers a new aspect in beauty and storytelling,8,15 January 2005,"Starting with Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" cinema has a new genre to deal with and even though we have all seen martial arts films before the way they are now made has become so visually stunning that even those who are not fans will be hearing more about them. The story here revolves around a nameless assassin (Jet Li) who has come to the King of Qin (Chen Daoming) with his version of how he killed the three assassins that have attempted the Kings life. Nameless starts out 100 yards from the King but as his story is scrutinized he is allowed to get closer until he is only 10 yards away which may or may not be what he wants.*****SPOILER ALERT***** The story involving the 3 assassins are shown in flashbacks with Broken Sword (Tony Leung) working in calligraphy that he believes helps him in sword battles. Assassin number two is his mistress Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Long Sky (Donnie Yen) being the third and since Nameless knows of their skills he uses psychology to try and defeat them. Broken Sword has an apprentice named Moon (Zhang Ziyi) that figures into the circle and adds to Flying Snow's suspicion of her so-called colleagues.Zhang Yimou has made a film that is clearly reminiscent of Kurasawa's ""Rashomon"" in the manner of the narrative with the characters giving different accounts to what may have happened with the three assassins. Yimou's films are different from anything else that I have ever seen and from the ballet-like martial arts to the beautiful uses of color his films are elevated from casual viewing to being a movie going experience. Li is exceptionally well cast and reminds everyone why he became such a big star in his country and the ease in which he performs some of the martial arts sequences is very evident. There are so many breathtaking scenes that take place that it would be impossible to describe them all but it's hard to shake the images of the battles like the one on the surface of the lake, the leaves blowing in the forest, the green sheets hanging from all sides, and the storm of arrows raining down. If I have to quibble it would be the confusion of what story is true and which one's are not but aside from that this is one of those visually stunning films that helps open the door even wider for a new style in the martial arts genre and gives proof that Yimou is one of the worlds more talented directors.",Hero

55,winner55,a great dramatic film,10,29 August 2006,"most of the reviews of this film referring to its politics, that i've read so far, have failed to see it in what once was called 'a world-historical perspective'. first, it should be pointed out that all films by Chinese - including those made in hong Kong, Taiwan, and even in the west - avoid direct presentation of domestic political issues. i don't know why, and it's too broad a topic to discuss here. but i mention it because when a Chinese film reflects Chinese politics in a strong way, even if indirectly, we should definitely pay attention and give it a chance.secondly, i remind the reader that during the 20th century c.e., the Chinese suffered through two major revolutions, two civil wars, and two world wars, not to mention the chaos of the gang of four's 'cultural revolution' and the disaster in tianaman square.throughout this period the Chinese experimented with a different governmental and economic structure with each of these bloody affairs, tampering with democracy, fascism, socialism, Marxist-socialism, Stalinist-Marxist socialism, 'back-to-the-farm' cadre organizations similar to the kibbutzim of Israel, and western style capitalism. no other highly populated nation in the world has suffered through so many violent changes in so short a time - ever.'hero' is a film about forgiveness. the Chinese will never progress if they simply dismiss the revolution of '49 as a big mistake; nor can they continue to follow Maoist state-socialism. if they make tianamen square a critical political issue, they could end up back in civil war; but no one in china is likely to forget it.so what else can they do, but to admit that everyone was wrong, and everyone was right. few Chinese participated in these violent crises in order to turn a profit - i.e., the instigators of all these violent moments hoped to produce good - and usually did, if only in a small way. if the Chinese can forgive each other of their own past, they will certainly produce the world's next super-power - and they know it. and that's what this film is about.the cinematography is beautiful; the editing may seem a little leisurely, but i found it graceful. the acting is highly impressive, and the actors have a fine script with sparse dialog to work with. the story is moving and elegiac, but never 'sad'. it is, after all, a movie about hope.as for jet Li fans - well, this is not a 'jet Li action movie'. this is just a great dramatic film that happens to star jet Li - and does a great job with it.see this without preconceptions; and i am not saying forget the politics - i'm saying, think about it.that's what a great dramatic film is supposed to do - get us to think about it.",Hero

57,DeeNine-2,Merely beautiful?,8,9 May 2006,"""Hero"" is a beautiful movie, as all Zhang Yimou movies are. There are spectacular outdoor, epic-like scenes, and wondrously colorful costumes and fabrics (and swords!) in addition to the choreographed sword play. I would also note that this movie was his most successful American box office flick--and therein lies a problem.Zhang Yimou is a great artist. He uses the silver screen the way a Michelangelo or Rembrandt uses a canvas. His sense of color and line and composition would cause Da Vinci or Picasso or any of the great Renaissance masters to sit up and take notice were they around today. His films are universally admired not only for their visual artistry but--and this is where I take exception to the direction in which that this film suggests that Zhang Yimou is going--their story-telling ability and their unusual sensitivity to the human condition. Here we have a fantasy of Chinese history brought to life. We have supernatural swordplay--beautifully, hauntingly done, to be sure: sword play as ballet--but what we don't have is a real human story.This is more like a legend. The great King of Qin, threatened by three great warriors--Sky, Broken Sword, and Flying Snow--is now threatened by a third, the Nameless one (like somebody out of a Clint Eastwood movie), who has pretended to vanquish the other three as a means to get within ten paces of the hated King in order to slay him. This is history as seen from the point of view of Great Men, not history as the force of events and conditions greater than any single person. This is also history as myth. It is nationalistic: the great Chinese king unites ""our land"" in a great historical event in which the Chinese people can take pride.It also glorifies war. The great gray mass of soldiers in the service of the king (Zhang Yimou actually used something like 18,000 soldiers from the Revolutionary Army of the People's Republic of China in the production) represents a force that will go on to triumph over lesser forces. The King of Qin can be seen as the ultimate warlord, the warlord with the largest army and therefore the one who will win.Yet, there is a sense in which this does not sit well with Zhang Yimou. He likes the individual heroes, and indeed would have Nameless achieve his personal victory except that Nameless sees in the end that killing the king would not be a victory at all. Furthermore, Zhang Yimou celebrates in the choreographed sword dances of his heroes the indomitable human spirit that will in the long run, triumph over the forces of sheer might. We can see this in not only the beauty of the dances, but in the association of calligraphy--that uniquely human art form--with the play of the sword. He who practices calligraphy with his heart and soul also learns the secrets of the sword.My problem with all this is that just prior to seeing this film I viewed Hotel Rwanda (2004) in which ironically the horrendous human slaughter in Rwanda was achieved in large part through the use of machetes made in China. Can we celebrate the sword about which it is said: if you live by the sword you will die by the sword? These are words that have only a tiny impact to us compared to what they meant to the people of 2,000 years ago who actually knew what it meant to die by the sword. Or should we more correctly celebrate the word, not the sword? For it is also said that the word is mightier than the sword.I think Zhang Yimou knows this, and I suspect part of what he wanted to convey in this film is that sort of message. However, I think his love of beauty and his sense of what works cinematically overcame what he might have intended, and instead of a great film we have one that is merely beautiful.But by all means see this. See this for his artistry of course. See this to compare it to the legendary kung fu movies. See this for Jet Li who plays Nameless and is a great favorite of the Chinese cinema, and for Daoming Chen who plays the king. And see this for the beautiful actresses Maggie Cheung, who plays Flying Snow, and Ziyi Zhang, who plays Moon. And last but not least, see this for Tony Leung Chiu Wai who plays the enigmatic Broken Sword.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

58,sme_no_densetsu,A sumptuous visual feast with a multi-layered story,8,7 June 2015,"Zhang Yimou's ""Hero"" is set in ancient China's during the Warring States period. After presenting evidence of having slain a trio of deadly assassins, a nameless prefect is granted an audience with the King of Qin. As he recounts the story of his deeds it soon becomes apparent that the situation is more complicated than either of them realized.Within this framework, Zhang gradually unveils a multi-layered story that examines the true nature of heroism. While the film has faced some criticism regarding the politics of its purported message, I feel that the theme is universal enough that detractors are merely reading more into the story than what Zhang intended.From a visual standpoint, the movie is simply stunning. Christopher Doyle's cinematography puts Zhang's direction and the meticulous production design in the best possible light. The distinctive use of colour throughout the film makes for a continually engrossing visual experience. The plentiful martial arts sequences are impressive, too, though the extensive use of wire-work probably won't suit all tastes.On the acting front, all of the principals perform admirably. Jet Li is the unquestioned star from a martial arts standpoint but he receives excellent support from renowned dramatic actors Tony Leung & Maggie Cheung.Overall, ""Hero"" displays a level of craftsmanship above and beyond that which is typical of action movies, whether foreign or domestic. Fine acting, sure-handed direction, stellar visuals & a thought-provoking story combine to produce a memorable viewing experience.",Hero
59,vithiet,One of my favorite movies of all time,10,29 December 2018,"The cinematography alone makes it worth watching even if you're not into this kind of Asian action movies. But it's also a well-written story and beautifully acted. I find it far superior to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and don't understand why it didn't achieve the same international fame.",Hero
60,mentalcritic,I am somewhat confused...,7,14 May 2005,"Confused, mainly because when I saw Ying Xiong on DVD-Video recently, I did not see the masterpiece promised by many others. What I saw was very entertaining, granted, but perhaps the inclusion of Quentin Tarantino's name as a ""presenter"" on the cover art put me off. This man needs to get his head out and realise he is not the messiah of cinema that he so often tries to project. Having said that, however, those who are fully involved with the film give it their all, and the results are frequently awesome. Forget all the stereotypes you know about poorly-synced Kung Fu flicks. This is a film with a serious story to tell, and that the story allows for many a fleeting display of martial arts skill is mere coincidence. All the elements for a brilliant epic are here, but something feels like it is missing. If I had to take a rough guess, Ying Xiong tries to be China's (or Japan's) answer to Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo, but doesn't quite get there for a number of reasons.Perhaps it is because of the comparatively short screen time. I am always the first to complain if a film goes on for longer than it should, but the ninety-nine minutes I saw here did not seem adequate to the storytelling task. The story, for what it is worth, revolves around an assassin who is known as Nameless. In the years before China was a unified country, he faces down three assassins who plot the murder of the feudal Lord who would unite the provinces into one nation. The film is told in a flashback style, detailing how Nameless fights down each of the assassins, and to be honest, this is where part of the problem begins. Until I read the IMDb summary, I had no idea that the film was about a warrior preventing the assassination of a King. With the flashbacks, flash-forwards, flashbacks within flashbacks, and everything in between, I was lost and confused. I have enjoyed other films where flashbacks occur within flashbacks, Ghosts Of Mars being a good example, but this risky cinematic technique was done well, as well as sparingly, in those films.In spite of the confusing edit and screenplay, Jet Li proves that he is currently the most famous lead in straight-faced Kung Fu films for a reason. His acting, especially the physical mannerisms, help to sell the character where the dialogue often will not. Some of his most striking scenes involve his complete silence. Unfortunately, the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon style of choreography is used here, with actors moving about on wires and going through impossible motions that really do not suit the story. Yes, the style worked well in CTHD, but I really felt, given the tone and serious context of the story, that a more down-to-Earth style would have helped. It is not a good sign when an even more outlandish Jet Li film, The One, features a more believable style of fighting than this one. Especially given that The One was basically a load of the proverbial, albeit one with a very sound background explanation. The fact that it had Carla Gugino, a far more likable lead actress than I have seen to date in any Asian film, didn't hurt.I admit, once the confusion over the nature of the plot is settled, it does make the film somewhat more entertaining. Unfortunately, it also raises a lot of questions that the film fails to satisfactorily answer. The question of why one would want to protect this King, who is seemingly responsible for the annihilation of a village as depicted in the early stage of the film, is high among them. Also taking a high place among the unanswered questions is why there is all the need for this study of calligraphy to defeat one of the three assassins. Yes, I realise that it is meant to improve fighting techniques, but the amount of time devoted to calligraphy in the film makes this easy to forget. I also found the derivation of swordsmanship secrets from calligraphy a bit hard to swallow. Maybe someone can figure something out about me from the way I always write in heavy block, but I doubt it will hold true once they take the time to make further observations. Still, the rolling out of the armies in each scene of this kind were impressive enough to justify the viewing time. Even if the repeated calls for Nameless' head towards the end of the film got on the nerves a bit. I am somewhat curious as to how the arrows were shot, too. If they are CGI, then they are the most impressive CGI I have seen for a while.In all, I gave Ying Xiong, or Hero as it is known here, a seven out of ten. It is not the best Kung Fu feature you will ever see, nor is it an indispensable classic of human drama. What it does have going for it is a very solid lead actor who should appear in more films, and some absolutely stunning cinematography. Fans of martial arts-based cinema need look no further, while those of us who prefer solid story or characters will also do well with a singular viewing.",Hero
61,sharky_55,Ying xiong,8,3 August 2016,"Hero is concerned not only with physical prowess and ability, but also the battles that occur within the mind. The entire film then takes place solely within the confines of the king of Qin's palace, and they are trading stories, not blows. Like in Rashomon, they are fighting for their own version of the story, attempting to gain an upper hand in the proceedings. And within these stories there are also mental battles; Long Sky and Nameless' initial clash is in their imagination, a vicious one-on-one muted in grey-scale. They are like chess grandmasters, with each blow calculated and bringing infinite possibilities and outcomes, so that the fight is over before it has begun. Their mastery of the art of swordfighting makes this possible. The choreography of Hero is in the wuxia style, which has been codified over time so that Western audiences may also come to appreciate and know its art. Masters of the style float over long distances as if they are suspended by strings, barely needing to touch the ground before they gracefully float away again (affectionately dubbed 'wire-fu'). When they fight their movements are so ferociously fluid that they whip up leaves into tornadoes, which curl around the characters themselves. Zhang Yimou is concerned with form as much as he is with function; Flying Snow does not merely repel, but dances amongst the rain of arrows, and the writers inside are painting with ink as red as blood, also fiercely devoted to their craft. Consider this: Broken Sword derives his mastery of swordplay from the strokes of his calligraphy. Or is it the other way around?The prominent art of Christopher Doyle is also on display. He begins with an initial dreary grey, a drabness to the present day story. This allows for the sharp contrast of the stories the two men tell, which are each punctuated strongly with their own colour code. There are a many number of possibilities and interpretations here. I was shocked by the vividness of the red ink, and its likeness to the blood shed by the diligent students of calligraphy. In the demonstration of the 10 pace killing technique Doyle and Yimou find beauty and tranquility in the cool blues, the apt slow motion, the little dink of the sound design as the cup lands on the sword. The blade is shown to be as ferocious as it is gentle. Robed in white, he reveals a purer technique, a strike of such surgical precision magnified in the shallow focus and slow motion. Yimou uses the latter well, cutting judiciously from serenity to furious motion, assuming the perspective of these masters who move and see at a different speed level. They whip their blades which such strength that they the metal bends and groans to their touch.The king tells his story with such passion and understanding. In his version, Flying Snow and Broken Sword are lovers so desperate to take the fall for each other they must resort to fighting for that honour. It is a tragic love story, more so than the apparent truth. This also points to the king's understanding of the nature of sacrifice; he is able to imagine the sorrow and grief of a sword twisted just enough to wound but not to kill, and that sword being beaten to save the life of another. So he is also able to recognise the greatest sacrifice of them all, and that sometimes the greatest warrior is the one who lays down their sword. So in the end it is indeed tranquility that wins out.",Hero
62,Stampsfightclub,One of the best foreign films I've ever seen,9,13 May 2008,"Jet Li stars as Nameless, a silent warrior who sits before The King of Qin and recounts his battles with three great warriors and how he ended up there within ten paces of the King.Chinese cinema is fantastic. From the brilliant artistic fantasy Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon to House of Flying daggers it continues to improve with marvellous direction, choreography and cinematography and this Oscar Nomination hit is no exception.Jet Li stars as Nameless, a talented warrior with a troubled life. Sitting infront of the King, he recounts his fights with 3 other great warriors, Broken Sword, Snow and Sky.The plot is told through flashbacks and many at that where director Yimou Zhang (Flying daggers) chooses a very colourful way of telling quite a dramatic story about loyalty, truth and love. There is also a strong ideology behind ""doing the right thing"" which is executed brilliantly by director and cast.The flashbacks provide excellent twists and turns to an exciting edge of you seat narrative. Though sometimes confusing they are visually stunning, especially the fight sequences.The choreography is astonishing with excellent one on one fight sequences. The lake fight is the best of the entire film, with the little drop of water proving so delicate and effective to the character's reactions and feelings.I have heard some people say that these special fighting sequences are sometimes a bit repetitive but that doesn't stop them being brilliant.These little fantasy elements to these films give the plot something extra, a bit of edge and extra excitement.The settings are wonderful, especially the lake and watch for the changing colours in the forest fight, similar to Flying Daggers.Out of the three mentioned, I personally favour Flying Daggers but Hero has the best use of flashbacks, mystery and rivalry to make it a great watch for all ages.",Hero
63,jon.h.ochiai,Stylized Hero,7,12 September 2004,"A Chinese proverb says that who a man is one of three things: who he thinks he is, who others think he is, and who he really is. ""Hero"" (Ying xiong) embodies these distinctions in it's unique visual and narrative style. In this case we have the color schemes of red, blue, and white representing the three perspectives. Director Yimou Zhang's visually stunning metaphor is ambitious and satisfying, but ultimately it is not entirely novel storytelling given the epic nature of this movie. Zhang's previous work included the great love stories, ""Raise the Red Lantern"" and ""Ju Dou"". His ""Hero"" is also a tragic love story set in ancient China prior to unification and the building of The Great Wall. However, this is more distracting, given this is suppose to be about the ""Hero"", Jet Li. Qin is one of the 6 kingdoms of pre-unified China. The King of Qin (Daoming Chen) is a ruthless, brutal, and uninspired ruler whose ambition is to rule all of China. Jet Li plays Nameless, one of his officials, who presents the king with the weapons of his three vanquished assassins-- Sky (Donnie Yen), Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai), and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung). The suspicious King listens to the story of his ""Hero"" determining whether he is his true savior or an assassin in a grand conspiracy. ""Hero"" has a great premise which falls flat. Jet Li is awesome as Nameless, probably a homage to the Clint Eastwood character in the Sergio Leone movies. Then again this character may be the Chinese mythology. Li has a silent power about him, and is perhaps the best martial arts star of his time. ""Hero"" illustrates the classic path of enlightenment for a warrior/ martial artist-- he trains his body and spirit to defeat his enemy, only to discover that protecting or granting life is the only noble pursuit. This is a great distinction, but I think it is muted somewhat at the very end. The dialog at the beginning of ""Hero"" is very dense. One gets Nameless (Li) is man of few words and a man of action. However, we get a lot of words in the beginning, literally subtitled. The action sequences are beautiful, stunning, and very stylized much like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" in the use of aerial wires. In one sense this is a waste given the world class talent of Jet Li. The best fight scene occurs early on with Nameless (Li) and Sky (Donnie Yen). That is amazing grace, power, and passion. Too bad this spirit is not carried throughout the rest of ""Hero"". ""Hero"" is beautiful to look at, and has something worthwhile to say, but the audience has little emotive investment in the outcome. That is really a shame.",Hero
64,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A visual masterpiece of color and choreography.,8,5 August 2019,"After the success of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) in most of the worldwide markets, it's no wonder that a film like Hero (2002) would make an appearance. Capitalizing on the choreography and visuals that brought Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon success, Hero takes these acrobatic battles to the next level, even to the point of them becoming ridiculous and semi-cartoonish. Add to this the deliberate color theming for each of the film's different sections, and Hero almost becomes a piece of art in its own right. It's almost a shame that there haven't been more movies like this in the years since.While some of the CGI hasn't aged well since 2002, and the acting can sometimes be too flat or too over the top, the story is still entertaining. The language barrier did make it slightly confusing at times, but the twists were top-notch. It did help to have the ""framing"" of the throne room to not only show the progression of the story but as a separation between the different colorful acts. If anything, it also added to the conclusion of the plot and the surprising ending that I didn't quite see coming.Partly because I watched this film in its original Chinese, I found the visuals to be so beautiful to the point of almost being distracting. How often was I watching some visual spectacle, only to realize I wasn't entirely sure what the characters were talking about during the scene. It does help that the plot is simple enough to pick up the missing pieces and understand what's generally happening. In the end, though, Hero is a visual treat in many regards, and it should be held as a high standard for what visual art can be in the hands of those who understand it.A visual masterpiece of color and choreography, I give Hero 4.0 stars out of 5.",Hero
65,juliankennedy23,It's so pretty...Yawn,4,20 February 2005,"Hero: 4/10: This movie reminds me of that old computer game Myst. Very pretty to look at (every frame is like a painting with incredible color) very popular (ranked 131 all time favorite on IMDb) and left me empty and frustrated. Put Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef in flowing robes and give them each ballet lessons and you have this movie. It's really a bad spaghetti western in disguise with a musical score that will drive you nuts and a story so old and obvious as to be almost worthless. Add in characters that I was simply unable to connect to and that flying kung fu that removes any sense of realism magic or otherwise, and the sense of waste is palatable. The movie puts together huge armies and then has them sit around or shoot a volley of CGI arrows at one building. They might as well be a crowd at a football game. Hero is frustrating like that since the lack of emotions and the story itself keeps one at such a distance all you can do is admire the pretty pictures. But man do they deliver those pretty pictures in spades.",Hero
66,TheNorthernMonkee,"absolutely, amazingly, beautiful",10,1 June 2005,"SPOILERS There's been a bit of a strange obsession for well made martial arts films in Western Culture recently. Films starring Bruce Lee and others have been around for years, but starting with ""Wo hu cang long"" (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) in 2000 the more artistically shot films have become a bit of an obsession. Proclaimed as being a film of beauty in 2002, ""Ying xiong"" (Hero) is another part of the love. Beautifully shot with some of the most magnificent colour techniques to be used for years, ""Ying xiong"" is another example of how the Far East can produce films so well.A nameless assassin (Jet Li) is invited to visit the King of Qin (Daoming Chen) after apparently slaying three powerful warriors (Tony Leung Chiu Wai, Maggie Cheung and Donnie Yen). As stories are told of these victories however, events begin to twist and turn as the truth comes to light.It's hard to think of a film in the history of cinema that has used colour to such perfection. With scenes entirely red, or entirely blue, the film switches through colours like a masterclass performance. Mixing these passionate textures with stunning fighting and special effects, the film thrives on this beauty to bring you scenes where your eyes practically melt in happiness. ""Ying xiong"" isn't a film as much as a piece of pure, majestic, art. It oozes beauty and it never stops as you witness a fight in stunning computerised rain, all the way through to seeing hundreds of arrows flying in unison through the air. This truly is a piece of art to die for.The amazing thing about this film as well is the way in which the plot isn't ignored. In a film where you are left in true, unashamed awe at the beauty on the screen, it would not be surprising for the plot and script to really become irrelevant and pointless. Writers Feng Li, Bin Wang and Yimou Zhang (also the director) haven't done this though. The story is immaculately well constructed and the plot never ceases to be powerful. There are twists, turns, and a conclusion which really is expertly laid out.In fact, there is little, to nothing, bad which can be said about ""Ying xiong"". Some suggest links to communism and a glorification of a brutal history, perhaps. It is certainly true that talking about the many over the few is a communist philosophy. Yet, the question is whether these complaints are really worthy of comment. ""Ying xiong"" is a beautiful film, and whilst it does glamorise aspects of China which might be best left alone, it never forces these views on you, and allows you to come up with your own conclusions about a lot of the characters and their morals.Beautiful from start to finish, ""ying xiong"" is a masterpiece in it's own right. Shot perfectly and vividly, it never ceases to impress and is a joy to watch. Hollywood might thrive on so many levels, but for pure beauty and colour, you can't look past Asia.",Hero
67,FilmOtaku,A film so beautiful it literally took my breath away at times,9,1 September 2004,"Before I delve into this review/random maniacal comments about the film 'Hero', directed by Yimou Zhang I want to make one thing clear. YES, I realize that this film is two years old. I have mentioned to several people that I saw this film, and upon mentioning the word 'Hero' I am interrupted with, 'You KNOW it was up for an Oscar two years ago, right?' For me that's like asking, 'You KNOW that Citizen Kane was in black & white, right?' As a matter of fact, a friend of mine had the DVD of this film over a year ago, when I sat and watched a good twenty minutes of the footage. Taken out of context, I found the scene that I watched to be ridiculously dramatic. A year later, I sat in the theater and was enveloped in one of the most beautiful films I have seen in my life.Having never been a fan of Jet Li's work, at least his American films, I wasn't sure what to expect of the performances in 'Hero', a story told mostly in flashback form, of a nameless man who defeats three assassins in order to protect the most powerful warlord of ancient China. I needn't have been concerned, because while Jet Li's performance was average, his supporting cast was wonderful, particularly Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung, both of whom I recognized from another great Chinese film, 'In the Mood for Love'. Both actors are able to speak volumes while saying very little, and sometimes, unbelievably, while keeping their faces frozen in one expression or another. The story is deceptive; what you think is simple really isn't, and therefore made 'Hero' stand a bit above other films in the 'samurai' genre. What is truly the star of the film is the unparalleled beauty of the film itself. The use of color is astounding; vivid blues, reds, greens, and stark white  every color is intended to mean something different; it is up to the audience to discern their significance. Fight scenes are more like intricate ballet dances than the classic definition of 'fight scene'. The actors fly through the air and fight in improbable positions, none of which is new; we've already been intricately schooled in this technique since 2000's 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' (and probably before), but the difference lies in the presentation and class with which these scenes are presented in 'Hero'. Zhang was able to employ a technique that is teetering on the brink of overuse and give it freshness by providing such beautiful surroundings: The water soaked fight between Nameless and Sky is a study in Honor. The duel in the forest between Flying Snow and Moon is so lush with its vivid red costumes and thousands of bright yellow swirling leaves that I literally gasped for breath because I had been holding my breath in awe. Maggie Cheung is the other standout in terms of breathtaking beauty. There were many times, particularly during the scenes at the calligraphy school, where I was held absolutely captive by her beauty and grace, something that I rarely even notice in actors during most films because I'm paying too much attention to the production values. Again, this is Zhang framing his subject masterfully. I also noticed a heavy anime influence in 'Hero', mostly in the fight scenes; a person is pushed into a wall and the wall crumbles but the person is fine, and particularly one scene involving a duel between Nameless and Flying Snow  there is a shot of Flying Snow that is pure anime; I have seen it in several series and it is compelling and beautiful. I have managed to ramble haphazardly about the things I loved about the film 'Hero', but haven't said anything about what I didn't like about it. That's because there isn't one thing that I didn't like about the film. Honestly, not one single thing. After I saw the film on Friday night, I turned the film over and over in my head, inside out, all weekend and the beginning of this week. I came up with nothing that I can lodge a viable complaint about. 'Hero' is obviously not going to be for everyone; die hard action film people are going to find it too boring, and it's going to be too much of a samurai film for those in the romantic comedy crowd. All I can say in summary of 'Hero' is that I've rarely had tears streaming down my face so often during a film, both because it is rare that I see anything so beautiful presented to me on film accompanied with a wonderful and emotional story. Do yourself a favor and see this film on the big screen  it shouldn't be missed.--Shelly",Hero

69,artzau,Good film,9,27 August 2004,"Zhang Imou always gives us a visual feast and this legendary fantasy with Jet Li is no exception.  From the standpoint of the expression of the mythic journey in Chinese culture, the conflicts of human passion and morality often take complex turns and varied appearances.  The flashbacks work well, with the mendacity of the plot well integrated into the storyline.  The movement of the tale develops slowly, deliberately, like the metaphoric calligraphy wrought by the warrior artists.  The whole tale becomes a huge canvas upon which these intersecting plots mingle, change and emerge at the end.  It's not perfect and there a few strands that do not get tucked away, but the film works and works well-- as long as you don't look at with the criteria of a Western drama, which several reviewers herein have done.  To be sure, you can say anything damn thing you want in this commentaries but to stretch this fine piece of art on a board built for a Euro-American epic misses the point and renders a disservice in my view.The film is visually satisfying with many wonderful moments of fine acting. Jet Li who often is cast in the protagonist role of a Rice Western, is superb in his controlled performance.  I plan to see this film again on the big screen and get the DVD when it's available.

70,jdkraus,Gorgeous artwork with a provocative storyline,10,9 May 2007,"Most Asian films are done with all visuals and artwork, which in a sense can tell a story. But what makes this film so amazing is the fact that not only does it tell the story through mere imagery, but it also tells it to you with a solid plot and dialog. It took me several times to see this movie over a few years period to fully understand it. And now with a conclusion to my mind about it, the film is fascinating with its two main aspects: film-making and storyline.The Film-making: It holds a beautiful and haunting film-making quality that ties with the prior ""Couching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" Whether it was from the top-notched action sequences, such as ""the duel in the autumn leaves"", holding strong symbolisms of blood, death, and downfall, which is expressed through the various shades of vermilion, scarlet, and crimson and ""the fight on the turquoise lake"", which shows the emotions of hate, love, mercy, and grief. Additional to the phenomenal action sequences, the set-production and costume design was amazing to look at, giving me memories of the artworks of the late Akira Kurosawa. Director Yimou Zhang is simply brilliant with oriental artwork.The storyline: Instead of having a story of a handful of warriors who fight against a tyrant, which the previews led to believe, it is about how a few individuals can change the heart of one man who can change a blood spilled country into a solid nation, rather than the suffer the brutal chaos of an all-out war. In a way, the film can be viewed as either an anti-war propaganda, or even a bit on the idealistic factor. But nonetheless, the moral of peace over violence creates a better world.**** out of ****",Hero

73,lawprof,CORRECTED REVIEW: Long Live the Qin Emperor. Long Celebrate the Honor of a True Warrior,8,4 September 2004,"[See the IMDb main page for ""Hero"" for cast names: only Jet Li is well-known in the U.S.]""Hero"" has been available for home viewing for several years but it needs to be seen on a big screen for maximum enjoyment of its powerful scenes, beautiful locations and impressive score. It's in theaters now.The Qin emperor long, long ago united a coterie of warring states to begin the violent, tortured process of wielding the immense land called China into a formidable nation (to give an idea of how ancient this story is, there were NO take-out restaurants when the Qin monarch launched his huge forces).In this film, directed by Zhang Yimou, Jet Li is Nameless which is his name since he wasn't given one at birth. A martial arts master, he enters into the near most crack-brained but unique conspiracy scheme in film history. From a province decimated by the Qin emperor's army, he's allied with three professional assassins, two men and a woman - all are sworn to murder the monarch.Through a series of flashbacks the conspiracy is rolled out with many fighting flourishes reflecting some rather neat martial terpsichore. Don't expect the story to make sense, especially to Western audiences. What makes ""Hero"" work is the internalized, expressed and slowly developed ethic of honor of the four assassins, especially Nameless. These people have a soul as well as a plot and it's projected very nicely. My teenage son couldn't even slightly understand Nameless's final expressive act at the end of the film, itself a comment on how different our time and our culture are from that of ancient China.The fight scenes aren't as elaborate as those in the outstanding ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" which has an elegance a bit missing here. They're good, though. But given the what and the why of the conspiracy a somewhat rawer approach makes sense. The gal-servant-with-a-sword, Moon, is beautiful and an interesting character by the way.I'm no martial arts-film fan but this movie was worth an hour and a half of my time.The score, by Tan Dun, a very important contemporary classical music composer (he won an Oscar for his score for the earlier Ang Lee kung-fu flick), is excellent. The score reflects a fusion of ancient and modern Chinese musical idioms. Tan Dun performs some of the violin solo lines but most proclaim the superb virtuosity of the greatest Sino-American fiddler, Itzhak Perlman.The CD of the soundtrack is for anyone who enjoys Tan Dun's exciting and very original compositions.For its type,8/10",Hero
74,WriterDave,A Feast for the Eyes,9,28 December 2004,"I was never a fan of martial arts films until Ang Lee turned the action sequences into art with ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon."" Here, with Yimou Zhang's epic ""Hero"" we get the idea of action as art taken to a whole new level. The film has an interesting ""Roshomon"" style of storytelling in weaving its tale of three proud warriors plotting to assassinate a tyrant, and it's more historical and epic where ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" was mythic and intimate. The visual palate is astounding. The use of colors is nothing short of amazing. The film's plot may not speak to your core, but there are lasting impressions here ingrained in the memory of your eyes: women in red sword fighting amongst swirling golden leaves, two men dancing across a crystal clear lake painting their sorrow with drops of water from their swords, rich tapestries falling to the palace floor as two fighters dart to and fro. The sumptuousness of the visuals are painstaking and almost make the viewer ache. The music, cinematography, and acting are all perfectly intertwined. Those who missed the film on the big screen may have missed out on a once in a lifetime experience. As good as the DVD transfer is, it just isn't the same overwhelming experience as seeing it where it was intended to be seen. Truly the kind of grand spectacle the movie gods had imagined when first creating the art form.",Hero
75,PIST-OFF,".. it is true, and I saw that her name was god......",10,3 November 2004,"Suffice it to say that I'm neither the first, nor will I be the last to mention or compare this to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but it makes the world easier to understand to group together certain things, and I have just the limited amount of scope or vision to fall back on such easy mnuemonic techniques. This is a beautiful film. It takes nearly all of the positive attributes of CT,HD and levels them up another notch. Along with the required complex and gravity defying (does gravity ever apply to the Chinese) choreography of the fighting and action scenes, the brilliant use of CGI (which normally drives plots instead of accentuating them), the tremendous acting by all, including the radiant Zhang Ziyi, and a wonderful plot that shifts in sequence, and perspective (Kane, no?) there a host of other little details that go almost unnoticed. Several sequences harked back to the very particular moves and actions that I remember from some of the classic kung fu movies of the 60's 70's and 80's. The colorful costuming seems vibrant and to make ever scene take on a life and importance of it's own. There is even some political lessons that apply very much to today's world. Pew. awesome. 10 out of 10. nearly flawless. shave and a haircut.",Hero
76,MichaelMargetis,"Crazy, Wild and Confusing... and did I mention Noisy too?",6,2 April 2005,"The thing that confuses most people about this film is what part Quentin Tarantino played in the film. A lot of the people I heard talking outside of the theater said he wrote and directed the film. Most of them thought that was the case, since Tarantino's name is the first thing you see in the trailer. But, he did not write or direct the film. He merely saw it after it was completed, and decided to help promote it. I found it quite comical people actually thought Quentin Tarantino wrote and directed a film in an entirely different language then his own.Moving on, I thought Hero hit and missed. Viewers going to see it merely for the traditional ""chop sake"" wire effects and finesse fight sequences won't be disappointed. However, viewers going to see it for an easy to follow plot and good acting will be sorely disappointing. The story in Hero is so jumbled and out of place, it will take you five minutes to get a grasp of what's going on when a new scene begins. The acting is decent, but nothing to write home about. I thought Jet Li would show a better side of his acting abilities, since the film is in his own language, and he doesn't have to concentrate on English. I was sorely mistaking. Jet Li's acting is substantially poor. He speeds his way through his lines, but doesn't disappoint when a sword fight scene comes up. All the other actors are pretty average, except Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon's Zhang Ziyi, who turns in easily the best performance of the film.An element of Hero many people will find surprising is the lack of blood. There is probably two specks of blood in the whole ninety minute feature. For those who don't understand why, the no-blood technique is the way old martial arts films used to be presented. There is a lot of flying around in the air during fights in Hero. It was entertaining to watch the first couple of times, then it got to be tired, and easy to poke fun at. It resembled scenes from Peter Pan. I think the whole flying through the air technique is really starting to get tired in Asian cinema.A part of the film, which drew many people to theaters, was the greatly anticipated re-match scene between Jet Li and Donnie Yen. It has been twelve long years since the two battled on screen in the martial arts hit Once Upon a Time in China 2. The reason the re-match was so awaited was because Jet Li and Donnie Yen are some of the best martial artists of the Eastern hemisphere. It would be like DeNiro and Pacino facing off in a crime movie once again  that's how big this was. People anxiously awaiting this battle sequence won't be let down, because the fight scene between them is perhaps the best action scene in the entire film.In conclusion, Zhang Yimou's Hero is worth seeing in the theater if you are into the mindless and neat action epics, with no room for intelligent plot. I predict it will be on video fairly soon. (review written 8/27/04). Grade: B-",Hero
77,judywalker2,Universal themes,7,4 September 2004,"I gave it 7/10 just because I don't care that much for martial arts movies with a lot of needless fighting and choreographed encounters. But I do think that this was a better told story than Crouching Tiger, easier to understand. It also had universal themes, unifying a country, self sacrifice and warriors having to put down their swords to become leaders. These are not communist or socialist themes as some have said. Seems to me unifying a country was the theme of ""Manifest Destiny"" on this continent. I liked the story of Snow and Broken sword, seems to be it was truly their story more than nameless'.

79,rdoyle29,A magnificent art house epic,8,22 October 2017,"The King of Qin (Chen Dao Ming) is waging a war to unite all the kingdoms of China under his rule. This has created enemies, and three assassins, Sky (Donnie Yen), Broken Sword (Tony Leung) and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) have vowed to kill him. Broken Sword and Flying Snow stormed his palace once and almost succeeded. Since then, no one is allowed within 100 paces of the King. Nameless (Jet Li) comes to the palace bearing proof that he has killed all 3 assassins. He is granted audience with the King and tells the story of how he defeated them ... with each story, he is rewarded and allowed to come closer to the King. When he is done, and only 10 paces from the King, the King expresses skepticism and offers his version of what he thinks really happened. A third version of the story is then told, which comes closer to the truth and reveals that it all comes down to these two men looking at each other face to face. The success of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and the reunification of Hong Kong with Mainland China made possible the situation where China's celebrated art house director teamed with a cast of prominent Hong Kong stars to make a martial arts epic. This is a happy circumstance. Zhang Yimou creates a sumptuous epic that's both visually stunning (each version of the story is uniquely colour coded) and thoughtful ... considering what a hero would actually be in Chinese culture.",Hero
80,Cinemaniac1984,Visually spectacular movie marred by fairly slow and uninteresting storyline.,5,2 May 2021,"Hero was a movie critically acclaimed for its visually spectacular martial arts on screen. It took me over 19 years to watch Hero but when the opportunity finally came to check it out, I found the movie to be fairly disappointing. The story was fairly slow and full of air and overall uninteresting. I found it hard to follow what the movie was about and by the end I didn't care too much how the movie turned out, instead I was waiting on the movie to end.I can't fault the fight sequences. They looked visually dazzling and was one of the few movies that didn't rely on blood and gore to make it more appealing.I've always enjoyed watching Jet Li on screen. I enjoyed watching him in a lot of his old movies from Hong Kong and also when he came to the USA where he made his mark with movies such as Lethal Weapon 4 (1998), Romeo Must Die (2000), Kiss Of The Dragon (2001), Cradle 2 The Grave (2003), and The Expendables trilogy (2010, 2012 and 2014 respectively). Hero was meant to be one of his most famous movies, but despite how popular the movie is it just didn't hold my interest.I'm sure I'll get plenty of people including friends who will think I'm mad as to why I'm not a fan of the movie. But to each their own.Hero was a movie which turned out to be very overrated and disappointing.5/10.",Hero
81,PyrolyticCarbon,Beautiful and visually stunning throughout with an excellent story.,9,27 September 2004,"Interestingly for this film I walked in not knowing what the story for this would be. Usually the trailer gives everything away of the movie (see Aliens vs Predator for the entire story of the film in only one minute), however this trailer actually gave me a totally different idea from the movie. This ended up being just as bad for me as I was a bit disheartened at the beginning, but that didn't last.The tag lines are flying all over the place for the PR, ""...most beautiful movie ever made..."", etc. Well they really aren't wrong; this really is visually stunning and is just a joy to watch. The locations, the costumes, the movements of the actors, it's just all so luxurious on the eyes.Talking of the actors, the quality is superb. For me, Jet Li wasn't the strongest, it was by far Tony Leung Chiu Wai as Broken Sword, followed by the very intimidating Daoming Chen, the King of Qin. Excellent jobs!Story wise, well I really am not going to summarise this movie, not that It'll spoil any plots, it's just that there isn't an easy way to do it credit in a short blurb. It's an excellent story however, and although you never really know what happened for definite, the journey is what makes this such a great movie.That, and of course, the beautifully filmed fight scenes. They are stunning, with some superb wirework that just rises above what has been seen in similar movies. Each single scene for the fights seems to have been thought of from a cinematic experience, and there is never a case where the fighting is there for the sake of it, each is there for a dramatic reason.The story plays out from multiple viewpoints, each presenting a different slant on the history leading to the opening point of the movie, and which do you believe?The beauty, I thought, is that all this just continues to build tension to the point you've been waiting for early on in the movie. The tiniest detail of the film represents a great moment, and the sparse dialogue helps to highlight each of these to perfection.I would thoroughly recommend this, it really is as it is billed, a spectacular movie. However, don't go expecting Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, the story here is very different, and although there are a few similar themes, the story plays out very differently and is filmed in a very different way. Also, listen for the superb Japanese Drumming group in the soundtrack.Excellent movie, a must buy on DVD when it is finally allowed to be released  check out the original date of this movie release in the Far East!",Hero
82,supertom-3,A visionary masterpiece!,10,1 November 2004,"Following the success and pure class of Crouching Tiger, there was a long wait for something as good to find its way over to the states, but now it has. Hero is an exceptional piece of film-making from director Yimou Zhang. The film is a lush and gorgeous piece of art that makes Crouching Tiger look like an ugly sibling, hidden away in the basement being chucked scraps of raw cow. Now this is quite something because Ang Lee's visionary epic was itself a very gorgeous film. Everything that Lee's film had going for it is right here with Zhang's film, from the gorgeous cinematography through to the wonderful production design, costumes, score and an engaging story full of philosophy, myth, religion and history. Which of the two films is better? Well it's a tough one to call. Both films have their strengths over the other but for me Crouching Tiger would narrowly pip this to the most because Hero's story becomes a little convoluted as it goes on. Also Crouching Tiger did have Chow Yun- Fat in it too.Hero stars the one and only Jet Li. Li is not known as a great thespian and it was essential that, being primarily a martial arts star, aside from the ass kickery, he had to hold his own against some great actors, such as Tony Lueng. Li's understated performance is excellent. It's a very stoic role but it requires a performance to come from within. It has to have the same power hat Bruce Lee gave in Enter The Dragon and Chuck Bronson did in Once Upon A Time In The West. Li pull's it off, it's a performance of real restraint and inner power and he looks a far cry from his wooden persona in Hollywood pap like Cradle 2 The Grave and The One. He is almost a narrator in the story and is the centre piece and Li was not the initial choice for the film. A more respected actor was wanted for the part, like Chow Yun-Fat, but Li thoroughly rules his role and makes this part his own. Tony Leung steals the movie though. Leung is fantastic a really great performance adding the gravitas that Chow did in Crouching Tiger. He is a great actor, right up there with Chow and deservedly was recognised in the HK film awards. Also starring is Maggie Cheung. Cheung is fantastic as well and unbelievably gorgeous. She made me want to break down and cry at the glorious creation of womanhood, and simultaneously go at it with myself in the cinema screen, but the threat of arrest was just about enough of a deterrent. You can sit and merely marvel at her gorgeousness with the sound turned down. Not far behind in the yummy stakes is Zhang Zhiyi who also starred in Crouching Tiger, she is also superb in this.The action in this film is brilliant including a fantastic martial arts fans' wet dream showdown between Jet Li and Donnie Yen. All the action scenes have a specific tone to follow and have certain colours affluent throughout the scene that will represent things like truth, courage and honour. The action looks amazing and beats that of Crouching Tiger in sheer imagination. At the same time this has a remarkably toned down Jet Li in the action, it's all very minimalist with his movements and doesn't utilize his fantastic kicking ability as much as other films have. The action shows Li as an ultimate fighter who does maximum damage with minimum effort. Also the action is far more weapon orientated than most of Li's other films. There are some great sequences here and understandably Quentin Tarantino was a big advocate for the film and whose determination almost solely got the film it's long awaited US release.This is arguably the film of the year and is a joy to behold. It's another lesson to Hollywood about doing an epic with subtlety and an action film with heart, and a drama with true power on a fraction of those inflated budgeted American star vehicles. Not to be missed. *****",Hero
83,christian123,It's a good film but not a great one,4,19 March 2005,"Hero is a pretty good film but it's not as good as I would have thought. Jet Li plays the warrior Nameless, who has defeated three assassins sworn to assassinate the king of his region. As he tells the story of how he defeated them, it becomes obvious that every story can be told a number of different ways. The plot is pretty good and sounds interesting enough, while the execution was pretty good as well. Hero is visually stunning and it has a lot of breath taking fight scenes. The fight scenes are done well but the rest of the movie isn't really worth noting. I'm not saying its terrible but it's just not very interesting to watch and it was kind of boring. However, the film is only 94 minutes long so it didn't bother me to much. Its kind of hard to judge the acting but I did like Jet Li a long with the rest of the cast. Yimou Zhang does a decent job of directing keeping the film at a slow pace which can sometimes be annoying. I did like the way they carried out the story of how he told how he defeated everyone. The cinematography was amazing as well and if it had not been nominated for best foreign picture then I'm pretty sure it would have taken home some Oscars. Rating 7/10 a pretty amazing film at some points however not all of it is like that. Hero is still worth checking out though especially if you liked Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.",Hero

The music is also good.It also surprised me a little that this film has attracted so many audiences who probably don't know much about the ancient Chinese history.

86,bix171,Dazzling,10,16 September 2004,"Enormously entertaining, Zhang Yimou's dazzling epic manages to revel in all sorts of stylistic delirium while maintaining at all times a controlled sense of dignity. Part martial arts actioner, with enthralling, satisfying fight sequences, and part Chinese history lesson, Zhang paces his story (written by Zhang, Feng Li and Bin Wang) with a rushing torrent of sharp images sure to keep today's distracted audiences locked in (it makes sense that the film is 'presented' by Quentin Tarentino; it's precisely the type of movie he admires--subtle yet exciting--and could probably never make) while delicately unfolding the mystery surrounding the motives of a nameless loner (Jet Li) summoned by the King of the Qin province (Daoming Chen) to be rewarded for bringing down the King's three greatest threats. Aided by the peerless cinematographer Christopher Doyle, there isn't a wasted shot and the perfect symmetry of visuals and sound editing (a myriad of sound editors are employed) is as captivating as the story being told. Zhang has a great love for his country's history and its ritual--he seems proud to present the tale of the unification of China as well as the compassion and pragmatism of the people who forged that unification--and he trusts his content, rather than the emotions of his characters, to be his means of expression; yet when the performers do put themselves across, even the most minimal inflection (the slightest smile, for example) is devastating. With Maggie Cheung Man-Yuk and Tony Leung Chiu Wai, the soul mates from Wong Kar-Wai's sublime 'In The Mood For Love', as two of the three threats to the King; again, they're perfect. 'Hero' is a film to surrender to--you're aware of the joyful look on your face even as you're hypnotized by it.",Hero

For one thing the characters did not seem to relate to each other in a realistic way. They were almost cardboard cut outs of the actors. I am sure its not the actor's fault, since I have seen them perform quite well in other movies. I do like the way the story evolves depending on which point of view it is being told from. The colors and settings are magnificent. Two of my favorite scenes : the fight between Maggie Cheung and Zhang Ziyi in the woods ; and the scene where Broken Sword meets the Emperor at the palace. There are elements that did not really work for me; namely the relationship between Broken Sword and Falling Snow and also the disappearance of Donnie Yen from the movie. He has one great scene and thats it. The ending was also lackluster. It felt very contrived and laced with propaganda. It reminded me of the ending of another Jet Li movie - the Bodyguard from Beijing. All in all, I recommend you see this movie.",Hero
88,brenttraft,This is the film Troy should have been,10,28 August 2004,"Ying xiong (Hero) is the film that Troy should have been.  The thing that makes Hero a great movie is the cinematic style rather than the story. Yimou Zhang is a director with a vision on how the film should look and like our dreams, the images prove to be more powerful than the narrative.Like Troy, this is an epic film set in the past, full of legendary characters.  Troy told it's story by filming its' actors reciting their lines.  Hero, on the other hand, develops exquisite images that linger in the mind and burns the legend into our subconscious.  If Yimou Zhang were to come to Hollywood and have $180 million budgets, image that masterpieces he could make.I didn't care for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Compared to Hero, it is a pretender while Hero is the real thing.  I generally avoid foreign language films but Hero is my favorite foreign language film of all time.  The story is pretty simple and people who put more importance on the story over the style will probably be disappointed.  This is my 3rd favorite film of the year behind Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Collateral.  It is better than anything that played in the theaters in 2003. 9/10",Hero

It was the same basic story of all martial arts movies. I'm going to kill you because you killed somebody and I have to avenge the killing so I have to fight you. Though each segment of the movie was in a different color the plot within each segment was basically the same, two people fighting. The segment continued until the stoic fighter beat the other fighter. I found it somewhat boring.The story was simplistic and the fighting, though maybe highly skilled, repetitious. The wire fighting scenes were ridiculous. I find them to be more Stan Lee than Bruce Lee. I think comparisons to Kurosawa misleading since Kurosawa had much deeper stories and characters.

Following the path of Ang Lee, Zhang Yimou has directed a film that might just give Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon a run for its money. Unfortunately, cashing in on the trend of Chinese martial arts cinema means that focus in its production is, in the case of Hero, slightly compromised. Often accused of being a derivative of Crouching Tiger, and is seen to be too indulgent in stylistic hues, Hero is far from the achievement that it beckons.The plot outline may be deceptively complex, but the underlying themes are recognizable - loyalty, love, and trust. Viewing Hero reminds of Kurosawa's superior Rashomon, narrating the film in separate and different sequences, all told in flashback technique. Zhang Yimou's mastery of this Rashomonesque style is sometimes flawed, with several loopholes. Artistically, Hero is very impressive, and some of the one-to-one fight sequences are greatly realized.

""Hero"" as much as ""Kill Bill"" wears its influences obviously, though perhaps in a less overt and flashy see-what-I'm-doing manner. The story of ""Nameless"" (read: Clint Eastwood's characters in Leone films) as he bests the finest of assassins is retold several times in several ways, leaving us to ponder Rashomon-like the real truth. The feats of individual skill and heroism are reminiscent of and even more impossible than those in ""Crouching Tiger"" or ""The Matrix"" (itself heavily indebted to martial arts films), though in keeping with the conservative and heavily censored Chinese film culture the violence is strictly PG-13. The film pushes its mythic single-hero capable of defeating armies conceit to the point where any tangible association with a real historical past is moot; these are Gods walking the earth.The film is awesomely beautiful with intricate color schemes changing scene by scene; the camera-work typically crisp, clean and painterly as in Zhang's previous films; and the performances are a good as you could expect from four of the greatest Chinese actors of their generations -- Eastwood-like Jet Li, emotional and vulnerable Tony Leung, fierce and proud Maggie Cheung and wild, impulsive Zhang Ziyi. I'm totally in love with Maggie who I've been following since ""Irma Vep"" and ""Comrades, a Love Story""; hard to believe she turned 40 on the day I originally wrote this piece.And yet, the great parts don't quite add up to a masterful whole. It's incredibly beautiful, stunningly acted and fought, and fairly tightly plotted, but there just isn't a lot to grab onto; the characters don't transcend their archetypes, and the end seems predetermined. Perhaps this would appeal most to the hard-core aficionados; I liked it quite a bit, and I'm glad that Zhang (once beloved in art-house circles for ""Raise the Red Lantern"", ""Ju Dou"" and ""To Live"") has a hit and that the foreign-language film seems to have some hold in America yet, but it just didn't leave me with much.

It's a visual feast that often awes you with its beauty.""The Spider's Stratagem"" (1970) boasts possibly the most dazzling display of color in a film in the last 40 years. In ""Hero,"" Australian cinematographer Christopher Doyle comes close to emulating what Vittorio Storaro did for Bernardo Bertolucci.With nods to Akira Kurosawa and, a lesser extent, Sergio Leone, Zhang unravels ""Hero"" methodically as the King of Qin (Chen Daoming) starts to take apart Nameless' (Jet Li) claims of vanquishing three assassins - Lone Sky (Donnie Yen), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai). Each of Nameless' stories and Qin's interpretations are brought gloriously to life with some spectacular display of martial arts and brilliant use of color.Two sequences in particular are thrilling - a swordfight among autumn leaves between Flying Snow and Moon (Zhang Ziyi) bathed in yellow and red as leaves whirl like tornadoes and people sail through the air; and a duel over a lake with Nameless and Broken Sword gliding across the water, their feet skirting the surface, their swords occasionally piercing the lake as if they were calligraphy brushes drawing intricate designs on the water. Wuxia films have been around for decades, but the supernatural martial arts were made popular in the U.S. by Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (2000), which set the standard as far as American multiplex audiences are concerned. Wong Kar-wai, Lee and Zhang Yimou are doing to wuxia what Sam Peckinpah and, later, the likes of John Woo and Ringo Lam did to gunplay.Its vibrant, rich palette notwithstanding, I wasn't as entranced by Zhang's film as I was with Lee's Oscar-winner. The pacing's a bit too slow and you get the impression Zhang's trying to outdo Lee by taking wuxia to new heights. Which poses a bit of a problem. Zhang's fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically, he runs the risk of them losing their charm, not to mention believability. Suspension of disbelief has its limits and Zhang's inching terribly close to the edge in ""Hero."" We're too aware of the technical aspect of it all - the digitally excised wires, over-reliance on CGI and, of course, excessive use of slow-motion photography. At least three-fourths of the film is in slow motion. More of this and the magic of wuxia will soon plummet from the fantastically splendid to the laughably ridiculous.And despite all its beauty, ""Hero"" leaves an awfully rancid taste in the mouth, especially when the true meaning of the film's title and the movie's central message become abundantly clear. The final titles scroll exalting the titular character's brave act and Qin's greatness as a unifier. And you realize exactly why ""Hero"" comes to us with the blessings of China's current rulers.I have no problem with nationalistic themes in films. And the idea of self-sacrifice has been explored in every film genre. But considering whom Zhang is talking about, his argument is vapid. He's venturing into Leni Riefenstahl territory here. At least, we knew her movies were propaganda.The trouble is Zhang's not trying to be ironic here. He's plainly kowtowing to the Chinese leaders. He's turned from a bold, courageous filmmaker who made provocative and defiantly daring films - ""Ju Dou"" (1990), ""Raise the Red Lantern"" (1991), ""To Live"" (1994) - to an artistic and artful propagandist for a ruthless regime. Through his protagonist Nameless, Zhang seems to argue that Chinese unity is a noble cause no matter who has to suffer. Zhang's arrogant to so blindly tout national unity, not when China, under the guise of that national unity, brutally oppresses Tibetans, stifles democracy in Hong Kong, threatens Taiwan with missiles, imprisons dissidents, massacres its own people at Tiananmen Square. Zhang's jingoistic call for unity, unity, always unity is naïve at best, repugnant at worst.Imagine the exact story set in a Taliban-led Afghanistan. In Pol Pot's Cambodia. Or, in 1930s Germany and the filmmaker embracing the ""greatness"" of the Third Reich and Hitler's desire to unify the Fatherland. That's when bile rises, when I get that acrid taste in my mouth and sickening feeling in my stomach.",Hero

100,masercot,Too Short...Way Too Short,9,17 September 2004,"This was a GREAT movie! It was a lot like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but with almost non-stop action. Jet Li played his usual quiet unassuming, but confident hero. He is a good martial arts star, but he is NOT what made this movie great...The direction and cinematography were what made the movie great. Spectacular scenes like a rain of tens of thousands of arrows and a duel in the autumn leaves. There was the constant blowing of silk in the breeze. It was a stunning motion picture...Ziyi Zhang, from Crouching Tiger and Rush Hour 2, was her usual snarly self.The characters of Broken Sword and Snow were much more complex and enjoyable. In the various retellings of the same story, relationships are invented, changed and destroyed. People die in flashback, only they didn't REALLY die, only maybe they did...who knows.An interesting feature to this movie is that you never see blood on any of the characters (my son noticed this). It might pool at their feet or drip off of a sword, but the wardrobe remains untouched. I feel that this symbolizes the god-like purity of the characters.The only problem that I have with the movie, outside of wanting more, was they death of key characters at the end (I won't tell you which one(s)). As I told my with after Crouching Tiger, ""If every character isn't dead by the end of a Chinese movie, the audience demands their money back""...See it!",Hero
101,JoshtheGiant,Really Good,8,7 March 2006,I am not a big fan of martial arts films. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is really the only one I liked before Hero. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was a masterpiece and one of the best films of 2000. It had a great story and was very powerful. It was also one of the most beautiful films ever made. The Cinamotogaphy is just stunning. Hero is while not anywhere near as good as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon but is just as beautiful if not even more. The cinematography is is some of the best ever. The art direction and costume design are also similar. The performances are mostly fairly wooden but Ziyi Zhang is wonderful in a small roll as a great warriors maid. What a beautiful film. Hero is wonderful and one of the greatest martial arts films ever just behind Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.,Hero
102,simon_booth,Impressive,9,10 May 2003,"It sounded like a HK Cinema fan's ultimate wet dream... Zhang Yimou to direct a martial arts epic with Jet Li, Maggie Cheung, Leung Chiu Wai, Zhang Ziyi and Donnie Yen in the cast, Ching Siu-Tung doing the action, Christopher Doyle the cinematography and Emil Wada the costumes. What more could you ask for? (Well, Brigitte Lin coming out of retirement and Yuen Wo Ping and Sammo Hung sharing the action director credits, perhaps).I guess we have CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON to thank for making the wu xia world bankable again, and generating the interest and investment required to bring a project of this stature together. There's no doubt that the US Market was a major target, and US$ went into the funding. Given this it's a tragedy that Yimou let Miramax get their paws on it and effectively ruin any chances it had of major US successApart from Zhang Ziyi and the Tan Dun soundtrack (a terrible choice no doubt enforced by US investors), CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON is not a good reference point by which to evaluate HERO. Much more appropriate is Wong Kar Wai's ASHES OF TIME, with which it shares two lead actors and a cinematographer. HERO is definitely more commercially oriented, but shares a beauty and philosophical richness with AOT, and a certain melancholy mood.The story of HERO starts off quite simply, as Jet Li begins to recount his martial triumphs to the Emperor of Qin. The tale is told in flashbacks which revisit and re-evaluate the same events, elaborating on and changing the story as we learn more. It's reminiscent of Akira Kurosawa's RASHOMON, and is a great way of developing a mystery thriller. Zhang Yimou handles the building of the tale expertly, as one would expect from such a master film maker.Zhang Yimou himself is such an accomplished cinematographer he hardly needed to hire somebody else for the job - but if there's anybody better than Yimou it's Christopher Doyle. I wonder how much conflict there was on set though, as I am sure each had very strong visions of how they wanted scenes to look. The result doesn't show any signs of it if such a conflict occured though, as the visual style seems exceptionally strong and focussed throughout. A large part of this is Yimou's use of bold colours to delineate the different sections of the story (The green, the red, the yellow, the blue, the white). With Emil Wada's stunning costumes and the great choice of locations, HERO is almost as rich in stunning imagery as ASHES OF TIME. It's a true work of art, harking back to Yimou's older films like SHANGHAI TRIAD and RAISE THE RED LANTERN - I'm really pleased to see him making such visual films again. The visuals are sometimes let down by some unconvincing CGI effects, unfortunately.Zhang Yimou has never directed an action movie before, so people were clearly worried he wouldn't know what to do with the fight scenes that a wu xia movie needs more than anything else. It's been quite a few years since Ching Siu Tung has produced any really impressive work too, so I was rather worried - especially when I heard (from good authority) that Yimou had Ching had clashed on set. Apparently Zhang wanted more grounded, realistic kung fu, which really isn't Ching Siu Tung's thing (should have got Sammo or Yuen Wo Ping!). I guess Ching got the upper hand in the end, as the fight scenes are certainly not grounded or realistic - they're very much about the twirling and whirling and the graceful flying that Ching Siu Tung virtually defined. They're not as manic as he usually makes the action when he directs himself, though - a fact that sometimes makes the wirework look a bit awkward.A real surprise is that the weakest fight scene of the film is that one that pits the two best martial artists together. Jet Li vs. Donnie Yen opens the film with some sword vs. spear action. There's some beautiful moments, but I felt the scene lacked impact and featured some awkward moves too. Oddly enough, the fight I enjoyed the most featured no real martial artistry at all - Maggie Cheung vs (well, you'll see) in a beautiful autumnal scene of falling leaves. I guess that's because Ching Siu Tung is really not working to his strengths when he tries to do ""real"" martial arts.I had held off watching HERO for months, because as soon as I got the first released DVD (the DVD-5 from Guang Dong Face Ah) it was announced that the extended version of the film would be released in a few weeks. It's generally well known now that Zhang Yimou was persuaded to cut about 20 minutes from the film by the hatchet men at MiramAXE, who really must die first when the revolution comes. I figured the first time I see it I should see the best possible version, for maximum impact, so I was willing to wait. Well it's been 2 months now and the extended version is now indefinitely delayed due to legal issues, so I finally gave in and watched the DVD I'd had lying around for so long. Now that I've seen it I have to say I don't really see what another 20 minutes would add to the film - it seems quite complete and well paced at about 95 minutes. A little more development of Donnie Yen's character would be nice, but other than that it's hard to imagine what is missing. Longer action scenes maybe? Or perhaps just 20 minutes of Christopher Doyle's beautifully composed landscape shots, or close ups of Maggie Cheung dying.I'm glad I waited to see the film anyway though, as it allowed all the hype and anticipation to die down.  Unfortunately, when a film is as highly anticipated as this it's inevitable that there will be ""backlash syndrome"" as people feel let down that it wasn't the ultimate movie of all time they heard/hoped it would be (it was amusing to watch the reviews on CROUCHING TIGER swing between ""incredible"" and ""awful"" as hype waves ruined the experience for many, and I'm sure the same will happen with HERO).Zhang Yimou is an extremely talented director in many respects, but perhaps the greatest is his ability to get incredible performances out of his cast. With such an illustrious cast on board he perhaps felt he didn't need to try as much though (or they weren't willing to listen), as the acting isn't as powerful as I had expected. It's still of a very high quality, but doesn't evoke the same strong emotions as some of the performances in ASHES OF TIME. Leung Chiu-Wai gets the top award for acting though, which will surprise few people. Zhang Ziyi only has a small part, but shows a lot of talent too - nice to see such skill in somebody that still has most of her career ahead of her. Of course, it was Zhang Yimou that discovered and nurtured her talent in THE ROAD HOME.There are only two disappointments in HERO, for me. One is the special effects, which aren't up to the very latest standards. A little less use of CGI would have made it go a lot further (like in CTHD). The other is the soundtrack, which is really just much too similar to the Crouching Tiger soundtrack. It doesn't fit HERO as well, but it is still pretty evocative and effective - just too similar to CTHD.I still intend to pick up the extended version of HERO when it's released, to see what Zhang Yimou's ideal vision for the film was. Even running shorter than he really wanted it's a mighty fine film though, and one I have no hesitation in recommending if anybody hasn't seen it yet. If MiramAXE ever do get round to releasing it in the US, I hope it does well.",Hero

It's martial arts action is simply unrivalled and incomparable to anything set before it.Zhang Yimou's direction is instantly plausible as you get the feel that this is a master's working.

The film is all images, all movement, all colors; it's all show - not just tell, and it demonstrates just what the art of visual storytelling encompasses when a maverick director such as Yimou Zhang does it at the peak of his game. Here he paints with celluloid like a master painter would with a brush, and the result is a movie of such breathtaking beauty the audience is often simply left in stunned awe. There are stories within stories in HERO, each with a different narrator and a slightly different perspective, and each storyline has its own color palette until all all the stories merge into one epic, multicolored tale. A masterpiece of Cinema, plain and simple, and one of the most outstanding films of the last 20 years.P.S.

105,AwesomeWolf,Needs more Donnie Yen,5,6 July 2005,"Here's something about myself that I still don't understand: I'm the kind of guy who thinks 'Hero' needed more Donnie Yen (in fact, all movies need more Donnie Yen), and who would recognize Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung from their appearances in Jackie Chan films. Yet when it comes to Zhang Yimou, I consider 'House of Flying Daggers' to be almost worthless and Yimou's earlier drama 'To Live' to be a much better film, more deserving of a place in IMDb's top 250 'Hero'. Honestly, 'Hero' is pretty boring.Thousands of years ago, China was divided into seven kingdoms, the most powerful being the Qin kingdom. The King of Qin (played by Daoming Chen) sought to unite / conquer all of China to enforce one land, one people, one written language, etc. The assassins Sky (Donnie Yen), Broken Sword (Tony Leung), and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) vowed to kill the King of Qin, but when the three assassins are defeated by a nameless official (Jet Li), Nameless is granted an audience with the King and asked to recount how he defeated the three great assassins.Now I don't mean to trivialize things, but 'Hero' originally appeared as a wu-xia rather than a drama, and it stars Jet Li and Donnie Yen and Siu-Tung Ching was the action choreographer. With such a line-up, how was I not going to expect a straight up as wu-xia kung-fu movie? Any fan of kung-fu movies would know that before 'Hero', Jet Li and Donnie Yen last faced off on screen in 'Once Upon a Time in China 2' (1992), and it is easily one of the best kung-fu fights on screen. Most of the action in 'Hero' is generally slow and boring. It definitely needed more Donnie Yen.People will tell me that I'm missing the point if I look at 'Hero' solely as a kung-fu film. Yes, I noticed all the pretty colours, and yes, I noticed the Kurosawa and 'Rashomon' style, but I still thought 'Hero' was rather dull. On the other hand, even though the ideology behind 'Hero' is arguable, I find it somewhat strange that a film that seems to support totalitarian ideology is so widely praised.'Hero' is a visually stunning film, unfortunately I'm not interested in that. It is a boring action film, and the message is somewhat questionable. It needed more Donnie Yen - 5/10",Hero
106,faraaj-1,Exquisite,9,25 October 2006,"Hero, China's most expensive film, is the best in the series of recent martial arts epics made by directors like Yimou Zhang and Ang Lee. I saw House of Flying Daggers and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon earlier and liked both. But Hero is on another plateau altogether.Very loosely based on historic events - the rise of the Qin empire - this is a mythical historic epic. Each and every frame of the movie is shot with care and exquisite emphasis on visuals. The colors, costumes and settings are letter-perfect in beauty and symmetry.The plot is Rashomon like. The Nameless Hero appears before the King of Qin - ruler of one of seven warring kingdoms. He claims to have killed three dangerous assassins who threatened the life of the King. In flashback we see how all three - Sky, Broken Sword and Flying Snow - were killed. The King counters with his interpretation of what the Nameless Hero's real agenda was and how he accomplished it. Hero then tells the King what really happened. All three versions of events are told in flashback.The beauty of the settings and the sword-fights is truly stunning. But, there are two moments which are truly amazing. The first is with the thousands of arrows flying through the air. The second is the fight between Nameless Hero and Broken Sword on water. I don't know where it was shot, but I'd love to see the place. Apart from these two scenes, all the other scenes are visually stunning as well.

Hero for change was a bit different. It had a strong historical-political background to it. It dealt with the individual characters quite well. Developing each one of them. Be it the character of Broken Sword or Nameless. The locales were beautiful. The action , to some extent different. and YET everything still the same. Unbelievable stunts. Glorification of Chinese virtues. Justification of of Chinese ethos and yes a highly melodramatic and charged up ending where one man gives his life for the greater Chinese cause. Now who can digest all this? surprisingly many did. In the west it was appreciated as a masterpiece. I feel most of the Chinese movies are promoted in Hollywood because of political and immigrant appeasement ends otherwise an unimaginative Bollywood commercial flick is a 1000 times more better than a seriously thought out Chinese movie , which in the end serves only some martial punches mixed with a truckload of reserved jingoism.",Hero

There is much drama in Hero and the movie begins with one intention and unfolds, in a deceptively beautiful fashion, into a legend that is much larger than the characters themselves are involved! Why did it have to take so long to prove such a point?Anyway, a man who shall remain Nameless has dispatched the kingdom's three top assassins, thus easing the King's mind that he could sleep at night. But the King is curious and we see the true story and how the tale unfolds.The fights are beautiful. The battle between Snow and Moon, though lopsided, was a joy. It was art in itself.

111,oshram-3,Pretty fluff,5,30 August 2004,"Of the many films of Akira Kurosawa that yet loom large in the creative consciousness of filmmakers around the globe, I remain the least impressed with Rashomon. While it is a fine enough film, I find it to be overshadowed by most of Kurosawa's other efforts. Apparently I'm in the minority on that view, because Rashomon is tirelessly copied again and again, usually without much skill or success.Hero is one of the more recent attempts to take the old formula (Rashomon is around five decades old now) and do something creative with it. Jet Li stars as the Nameless One, a super bad-ass who defeats three assassins who wish to kill the King of Qin (Daoming Chen), who wishes to conquer the warring states of pre-China and unite the country in one great realm. All of the film is actually told in flashback, revealed in a conversation between these two characters. We see the same sequence of events three times, with precious little variation between them plotwise.And I suspect the makers of Hero knew this. The film is extraordinarily short on substance and very long on style  not always a bad thing, but unless you're extremely deft, you're going to get caught, and to my mind, they do here. Taking a cue from the Back to the Future films, the Hero folk realized if you're going to watch the same thing over and over again, it had better be really pretty. And that's where the strength of Hero lies. The visuals are sumptuous and stunning; we are treated to mono-color designs (that must have been computer enhanced) that absorb the eye in vibrant pools of color. Save for the Nameless One's fight against the first assassin, Long Sky (Donnie Yen), every other flashback is told in a single but different hue; one time all the clothes and sets are blue; another green, and still another (and the most striking), red; and so on. This provides some breathtaking visuals, and is really quite very well done. But unfortunately, it still remains expertly executed window-dressing on a paper-thin plot. If half the attention had been paid to the story as was lavished on the visuals (and casting: Maggie Cheung, Tony Leung, and Zhang Ziyi show up as well), then Hero could have been much more than just extremely pretty eye-candy. But it's not.",Hero

He has amazing screen presence in Hero and is an amazing martial artist. Some of the scenes, like the fight over the lake are amazing, its like watching a dream. The story can be slightly confusing, well to me anyway but is well worth the effort. I hope Jet Li can follow this up, but it is a hard act to follow. Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung offer classy support and Jet Li even gets a rematch with Donnie Yen in Hero. If you liked Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon I highly recommend this film.",Hero
113,Barky44,Living Anime (If You're Into That Sort of Thing),7,18 September 2004,"""Hero"" is a Chinese high-art film. It tells the story of a sword master (who is never named) who kills three assassins and goes to the king for his reward. But it is not quite so simple. There is intrigue here, exploring issues of trust and subterfuge.In essence, ""Hero"" is really a comic book. Not your average ""Green Lantern"", but from the anime genre of comic books, artistically done, beautifully drawn, intriguing in their own way. The film's characters are all symbolic avatars of emotion or thought or action, involved in fanciful fight sequences surrounded by a lush and beautiful landscape of scenery and set design. On set design alone ""Hero"" deserves an Oscar nomination.The problem with ""Hero"" is it serves a niche audience: those who favor such comics and anime features such as ""Gundin"" and others. It is not a particularly strong film beyond that. The fight sequences are overdone and so unbelievable as to be boring. The characters are really one-dimensional, and the plot is quite transparent. As drama, it fails.But as this exclusive oriental art form, it succeeds.Well, except for the music. The music really blows.

114,noizyme,Beautiful and daring,9,1 September 2004,"I had my doubts with this film at the start because every movie coming in to theaters in America has a standard of trying to out-do movies like the films before them in the same genre. So having seen Croutching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and the Matrix and every other major, ""good"" movie that hit hard in theaters a million times or more ripped-off in other movies (parodies or not), I was hoping hard for this film to be a stand-out film. I was not let down, though.This film is one word: loud. Loud colors and loud sound effects. Loud emotions and seriousness in each of the actors/actresses. Loud and huge sets. Deep and wonderful. Jet Li needs to put his efforts in more films like this one. I loved the ""dreamscape"" shots with their impossible physics and vivid, colorful crispness. The director had a great vision and created a purely honorable and respectful film for the rest of the industry.I'm not sure of the origins of this story (either imaginary or factual) so I can't say whether the story was more appealing. Rather intriguing, nonetheless. Definitely a DVD to own when it comes out.",Hero
115,Pavel-8,Super Hero.,7,1 November 2004,"Every year as August winds down, ending with it the summer movie season, I get burned out on theatrical releases, having seen most all of the major summer flicks, as well as many independent films. Typically one release resurrects my cinematic spirit, and this year ""Hero"" (""Ying xiong"") filled the role. It is the latest martial arts film from China to invade American cineplexes. In many ways, it reminds of the last such successful film, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" except that ""Hero"" has a plot. Just kidding...sort of. In actuality, the story is much more concise and straightforward than ""Crouching,"" despite the non-linear method. In ancient China, the nameless...er...hero of the story, portrayed by the familiar Jet Li, arrives at the palace of the emperor. Having slain three of the emperor's enemies, Li, whose character is nameless, has come to claim his reward. As the two discuss how Nameless accomplished his deeds, we see (through extensive flashbacks) what did and didn't happen, and the truth is ultimately unearthed. Were the plot told in a linear manner, the story would not be especially noteworthy, but how the tale is told elevates the narrative. With truths being revealed in an unorthodox order, the audience is kept off-guard and pensive, trying to match wits with the two primary characters, who are each uniquely brilliant. Like most Chinese cinema, much about ""Hero"" is drastically different from the majority American cinema. Most blatantly apparent is the vivid color scheme. Exploding off the screen, the variety of dominant colors throughout the flashbacks propels the film by generating a bold yet natural vivacity that leaves viewers eager to indulge in whatever beauty may occur next. The cinematography of some films (""Lord of the Rings"") rightfully soars due in large part to the scenery. But ""Hero"" excels using traditional photography in a non-traditional manner with a dramatically ebullient color palette that literally takes one's breath away at times. Despite the nearly peerless visual artistry, ""Hero"" still presents an occasionally difficult viewing experience, one that does not necessarily detract but does sometimes distract. I say this fully aware that as I have been raised, for better and worse, on American cinema, and am thusly accustomed to such work. Chinese films are quite simply different, and these vagaries of pacing, shot length, etc., prevent full involvement for many American movie-goers. There isn't one feature of ""Hero"" that causes this disconnect, as all aspects are well executed. The small cast, with Jet Li as the primary recognizable face, effectively exhibits the renowned passion of Chinese cinema. The editing is clean and efficient, maintaining a clear narrative when the story could easily have been convoluted. None of the parts produce the difference. It's more like watching a genre you've never seen before; you're simply not entirely sure how to react at times.Bottom Line: If you're a fan of Chinese martial arts films, then you may have already obtained a DVD of ""Hero,"" since it was released in China two years ago. If not, or if you want a different cinematic experience, then go see ""Hero"" to discover the upper tier of Chinese cinema. You won't regret it. A high 7 or low 8, out of 10.",Hero

It combines all of the elements of ""The Matrix"" and ""Kill Bill"" to provide excitement beyond one's expectations. This film stars Jet Li. Tony Leung Chiu Wai plays Broken Sword. Maggie Cheung plays Flying Snow. The culprit is the King of Qin played well by Daoming Chen. The war games are done is a dance like fashion that defies gravity. The cinematography alone is worth the price of admission. Color speckles the canvas on the screen in such a way as to emulate a visit to a fine museum. Don't let this masterpiece slip away. It is now on DVD. Even without the understanding of the Chinese language, one can have a great theater experience. ""Hero"" is a 10 in my book.",Hero
117,EasternZZ,Not a typical martial arts movie,10,15 August 2018,"This is a historical martial arts drama with a lot of talking. This movie has great use of color. The story is the main focus in this story, although there are a lot of cool fight scenes. Very philosophical movie with deep themes. Not a hollywood movie, but a movie for people who have brains.Don't expects explosions and stuff, although there are a few CGI effects in the movie. Beautiful movie, soundtrack, and story. The final 15 minutes are also amazing.",Hero
118,toqtaqiya2,Wuxia films don't get better than this.,9,31 July 2010,"Hero is one of the most stunning martial arts epics ever. I was somewhat disappointed by recent releases like Curse Of The Golden Flower (2006) and House Of Flying Daggers (2004). That's not to say that they were bad because they were filmed well and were sometimes thrilling. But their stories didn't pull me in. Hero, however, is a triumph. It really touched me with its story of revenge, war, politics and devotion. The first thing I noticed while watching it was its superb use of color. The cinematography is gorgeous, and often scenes are dominated by only one color. China rarely looks this good in films. The martial arts fights are elevated to graceful and artful. The backdrops of these fights are stunning. The fights obviously have elements of fantasy. Thus, even special effects were used. None of them look fake, however. Even the fight on a lake was filmed without errors or missteps. In the acting category famous actors from Hong Kong were cast as the assassins. It was good to see them in one film. They're middle-aged now but this is fitting because they play wise and experienced fighters. The real surprise is Chen Daoming, playing the King of Qin. He's a tyrant but Daoming turns him into a likable persona, just what the film requires. He hardly moves during the film, but just the way he talks is interesting. The film's message is definitely thought-provoking. Hero is one of the most expensive films in Chinese history, and also the highest-grossing. There are many extras, big imposing architecture, and incredible martial arts fights. It's definitely a must-see film, one of the best martial arts films ever. I highly recommend it.",Hero

Following in the mould of its spiritual predecessor Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Hero is a succession of sweeping landscapes, vivid colours and high wire action that sees Jet Li return to his native China to assume the lead role.

If the answer is yes, you might like this one.The film is praised for it's fantastic visuals and... come to think of it, that's all there is. There is absolutely nothing to care about in this film. There is zero back story - just a handful of people with swords staring at each other, flying, jumping, and philosophizing.The entire plot is made up of fight scenes, repeated in the absurd. I think that one of the fights was depicted three times. The setting and colors were different, but if you've seen one of the fights, you've seen them all. If you deleted all the repetitions and rolled the film at normal speed, it would probably be around 30 minutes long.As noted earlier, there are some pretty pictures - but you can get that from a travel brochure as well. The rest is just sleep inducing pretentious rubbish. See Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon instead. [1/10]",Hero

Terrific acting all-around, even from the rather stiff Jet Li. Excellent fight scenes that don't bore in the least bit and can be watched over and over again. The care and attention brought to each of the fight scenes shows a master at work; the visuals used to show the skill levels of the various combatants exhibits equal mastery.

The story-telling in this movie is so vivid and poetic that you cannot help but love every single second of every single story that is told. The Character Sky represents strategy and cunning, Broken Sword represents rationale and understanding whereas Flying Snow is hatred and revenge. Nameless (Jet Li) encounters all of these characters and embodies all of their aspects.The color schemes used are incandescent and only help to propel the viewers into the tales that these warriors are telling the audience and each other. With one story you get white, another red, green, blue. They set the mood and get you the viewer anxious to know what this story will say. The way that each story is presented (although some untrue) builds the characters up in a way that you see that there is more to them than their basic diagnostic. You really see this exampled with Flying Snow, as she is shown as wanton, loving, vengeful and true. In the end you really need all of the stories to understand every character fully.The director of this movie did an outstanding job. This movie has great editing and direction, it is very clean and precise, never losing the attention of the audience.If you don't like foreign movies this movie will change your mind to appreciate them, and if you already like them then this will jump to the top of your list of favorites.

123,poikkeus,Breathtaking martial arts saga,9,12 June 2003,"Zhang Yimou, who has always been expert in managing complexproduction details, directs a film that shows how Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon should have been done. Both films have many ofthe same elements -- including extensive use of wires to levitatethe heroes; but everything seems more distinguished here, fromthe photography to the great martial arts sequences.It has been noted that the film narrative is set up like Rashomon, apoint that's well taken. But instead of Kurosawa's extreme realism,Yimou fuses Chinese pre-dynastic history and fantasy in a mannermuch more similar to classic HK martial arts films. While theevents leading up to the first Chinese emperor has been donemore credibly elsewhere, it's never been presented more vividly.Jet Li (who would have been a welcome replacement to ChowYun-Fat in Crouching Tiger...) is one of only a few actors who couldpulled off both the athletic and acting demands here. Donnie Yen,Maggie Cheung, Zhang Ziyi, and Tony Leung round out a fine cast.
The action is spectacular, often shown in medium slow motion tocapture the grace of the martial arts. But the visuals are equallyimpressive; whether fighting on the surface of a serene lake, or ina forest filled with autumn leaves, the look of the film is frequentlymesmerizing. While the film has not been released in the U.S. yet, inexpensiveimport DVDs are widely available online, so there's no excuse forpassing this one up.",Hero
124,kenstallings-65346,A film that needs two reviews,5,28 December 2019,"Hero is a unique film in that it needs two reviews. The first review would be founded upon the standard set of criteria: production, directing, scripting, acting, cinematography. On nearly all of those measures, Hero remains an outstanding effort.Unfortunately, there is another criteria that simply cannot be ignored, especially with regard to this film. This film fails miserably in terms of its message. It is, in fact, a government sponsored propaganda film, and given that said government is the Chinese Communist Party, then this message cannot morally be overlooked.We have here a beautiful film that tells the story of a young man with exceptional kung-fu talents, so well developed that it appears he is impervious to mortal risk in combat. And yet, having spent over an hour of film explaining this reality, as well as treating said man's honorable quest to right great evil, when presented the very moment he has carefully planned for, he abandons his entire quest and allows himself to be killed by the very evil man he wishes to vanquish.Why the sudden change of heart?Nothing more than said evil leader's appeal to the nationalistic need to even embrace evil if said evil controls the future of a nation!This sort of fascistic evil would hardly be tolerated if any western director and production studio had attempted to peddle it. Rightly, such a production would be widely condemned for defending evil.For those who have to earn a living within the Chinese Communist system, such as director Yimou Zhang, one has to carefully phrase things to balance between a compelling desire to tell the truth, and an understandable desire to avoid torture in prison.For his part, director Zhang has said, ""The Chinese censorship system has been in practice for many years. I don't think there will be much change in society in the short run. This situation has been present for a long time and it is a reality in China. I work and live in this system.""He also said this, ""When I look back at the times I shot artistic movies, I found I learned quite a lot from them. I hope to do both -- make more personal films which I prefer; and in certain circumstances, I will shoot some other commercial movies like these two -- Hero and House of the Flying Daggers.""Finally, to perhaps fully explain the director's actual views, there is this quote he made: ""Western audiences can gain an impression of China from my films. This is an excellent channel for promoting China's culture.""When one puts those three quotes together, one can piece together the honest expressions of a conflicted man, one trapped in a system of censorship, where he has to produce movies paid for by the Chinese Communist film industry, and also avoid any criticisms of it that would land him in prison.On every moral foundation, Hero must be looked at from both an artistic and political level, because it is a movie spectacularly well made, that was intended from the start to be a propaganda film that supported the Chinese Communist government. The masterful director who created the film seems to be trying to thread his way through a risky political needle, to both express his fears, but also avoid suffering for those expressions.A movie, who's mission is to support evil, cannot be considered a positive effort, regardless of how hard the people work to try to make it a masterful creation. This is sad, because it reveals human talent being abused by selfish interests, and in that regard, the ultimate truth of this movie is that it stands as a warning beacon for the dangers in state sponsorship of films. Perhaps one day, even those who made this film will be able to finally stand free and state their own moral angst at having been forced to make it the way they did.Until then, we, who do live free, must say it for them. This movie, ultimately, must be measured more by the politics that created it, vice the production values it otherwise possesses.",Hero

The Emperor of Qi wants to unite all the kingdoms of China together under unified law. He has a very ruthless strategy of unification however, slaughtering thousands and seizing thrones everywhere. Many assassins have crossed the land to assassinate the Emperor but all have failed ...One day a swordsman named Nameless is presented in front of the King for his achievements of slaying three masterful assassins: Sky, Snow, and Broken Sword. Broken Sword and Snow have a love affair going, and rumor has it Snow had a one-night with Sky. To stage an act of jealous murder, Nameless slains Sky, and tells Snow it was Sky's dying wish for her to avenge him and kill Sword. Snow falls for the trap, and is easily defeated by Nameless after she kills Sword.The Emperor has doubts about Nameless claims, fore he too fought these great warriors and knows them not to fall under the guises of feelings. The Emperor's theory is the four assassins are working together to get close to his throne. He and Sky staged his murder so Nameless will be granted permission into the kingdom. Nameless then goes to Sword and Snow to enlist their help. Snow agrees but Sword refuses, believing the Emperor will indeed bring peace to the lands through his unorthodox tactics.Sword's clever words make Nameless hesitant. He relays Sword's message to the Emperor and the Emperor has a moment of epiphany when he understands the people who understand him the most are a rag-tag team of assassins. He's pressured into killing Nameless for his plots, but buries him a Hero instead of a traitor. The Emperor then goes to unite the six kingdoms and build the Great Wall of China..8.5/10",Hero
126,kylehodgdon,Likable,6,11 November 2009,"As far as these types of movies go, I would say that ""Hero"" is probably one of the better ones. Miles ahead of ""Crouching Tiger"". Jet Li looks very good in his role and does a magnificent job with the action sequences. I think it is neat that he remains nameless throughout the film. His character is really driving the movie as he really does look like a hero up against insurmountable odds. Zhang Ziyi is again typecast in the same role that US movie goers identify her to be in. She is on par in the role as usual. The sound and music in this movie are very fitting and assist the battle scenes. The colors are amazing throughout the picture. Whether a scene be mostly done in blacks and grays, or mostly reds and oranges, or any different colors, they always look beautiful. The shot with the arrows is a very memorable one.

I even dozed off at one point. And all through were scenes and bits and pieces that seemed to be almost the same as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" Zhang Ziyi is used to no purpose except she is popular right now. She is given very little to do. In fact the story is so light that we really know very little about what they are about.

129,colonel_green,Visually ravishing; philosophically suspect.,10,11 September 2004,"After two years of delay, the Chinese martial arts masterpiece ""Hero"" arrives in Western theaters, and audiences look for the same dazzling swordplay that made ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" such a success (for the record, though, I wasn't a big fan of that movie). While the plot isn't particularly original, or important, it involves the arrival of Nameless (Jet Li) at the court of the King of Qin [Shi Huangdi, although his name is never explicitly stated on screen](Daoming Chen). Nameless has killed Long Sky (Donnie Yen), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung), and Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai), three assassins who have vowed to kill the King to prevent his wars aimed at conquering all of China. Nameless recounts his story of how he defeated Long Sky, and then strategically set Flying Snow and Broken Sword against each other; also involved is Broken Sword's apprentice, Moon (Ziyi Zhang, from ""Crouching Tiger""). The King of Qin, however, believes that Nameless and the three assassins are in fact engaging in an elaborate deception to kill him. The film borrows from Akira Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" (or, really, any of the movies that have already borrowed from ""Rashomon""), in that we see multiple accounts of what supposedly has (Nameless's account, the King's version, and what really happened), each one using a different colour scheme (Nameless's story is primarily red, the King's version is blue, and the real story is white; green is used in the present, as well as in a few other flashbacks). The fight scenes are superbly staged, balletic even; my personal favourite was the fight between Nameless and Broken Sword over the lake, with the two combatants skimming across the water. The scale of the film is awesome, with director Zhang Yimou showing us massive armies arrayed in the desert and at the Court of Qin, and thousands of arrows flying through the air, obscuring the sun. Acting is good, with Maggie Cheung being the best, but there are no performances that will win Oscars; martial arts movies aren't built on acting in the traditional sense. The only troubling thing about ""Hero"" is the underlying philosophy that the film seems to promote. Nameless comes to believe (as Broken Sword already did) that the King of Qin's bloody wars and tyrannical rule are justified in that they will unify China, and Nameless allows himself to be killed rather than kill the tyrant. I find that entire philosophy suspect. In the end, though, ""Hero""'s philosophy scarcely matters in the long run. It's a visual film, and a great one. I give it 10/10.",Hero

Broken Sword seemed the most brutal yet was actually the most intellectual and Flying Snow his ex-lover was the one who remained locked in her passions in and out of bed...The Emperor too was good in his own way, like Broken Sword he appeared to be a dictator until he spoke of unifying even the written language of what was to be China (BTW: a quick e.g. ""ma"" has five meanings... Rope, horse, shrimp, mother and placing oneself in a fighting stance - especially in Oriental chess that is called ""go"" in Japan)!This was a fascinating study of what is truth, and also the complications of unifying a whole kingdom - for a long time Chung Kuo / Middle Kingdom was China's nickname (I used to confuse it with Tolkien's Middle Earth), but I never knew about ""Our Land"" until now...Fly, skip running, to see this masterpiece that must've inspired ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""!!",Hero

The aesthetic deliberations far outweigh the dramatic ones in 'Hero' which had the whole world at its feet when it opened. Yimou's film is so delicately hand-colored, so utterly sophisticated in the way is blends colors as a masterful sherbet dessert. But there are no ambitions beyond the coy titillating of the senses with a tiresome haute couture-ish, narcissistic exterior.

And i am fully aware of the bittersweet meaning of the story.But i couldn't help but feel it dragged on; in a 90 minute story it felt like i was on a mental journey on the Great Wall of China; seemingly never-ending. I love martial arts films, and like many i especially love the fight sequences. If you're wondering what style of fighting you will be seeing, then just picture ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". If you haven't seen that, then just imagine a Ballerina on drugs. Hopping and prancing and flying; although the surrounding scenery is spectacular, the fact these ""enemies"" are doing more graceful floating than fighting is somewhat distracting. It still is an OK film; but for me,the visuals just couldn't sustain my focus for the full duration, it needed to flow smoother. Rather than going back and forth continually. And also having up to 3 scenarios for each scene was rather tedious. Someone did recommend watching it more than once, but i would find it hard to do another round of the Great Wall without becoming exhausted.4.5/10",Hero
134,JimD73,Great Cinematography but Nothing Else makes Hero Extremely Overrated *Slight Spoilers*,2,2 February 2005,"I could tell this was going to be weird. It's another crazy, flying, slashing, kicking, Chinese Matrix-wannabe. I knew that Quentin Tarantino, one of my favourite directors, put his name on this to keep it from being edited and nothing more. That's right. Tarantino has absolutely nothing to do with this. It was kinda his Kill Bill's fault I was inclined to see this. Kill Bill was great, and I would love to see another scene compare to the Crazy 88 sequence. I needed a fix of crazy Chinese flick. This one did have extremely high ratings and it was now on video. So is Hero really as good as they say it is?Plot: .4/2.5: OK, we have this guy namedNameless (Li). He has slain three great assassins who were bent on killing the King of Qin (Chen). This takes place back when China consisted of the six warring nations, with the battle between Qin and Zhao being what we care about here. OK, so these assassins were bent on killing the King and Nameless killed them. Nameless is going to have a customary drink with the King for having killed the assassins. Nameless tells the tale on how he discovered how to play the assassins against each other. He knew that two of them, Broken Sword (Leung) and Flying Snow (Cheung) were lovers, but he finds out that they have since split up as Snow had an affair with the third, Sky (Yen). To put everything in place, Nameless killed Sky first, which brought Broken Sword (or as I call him, BS) and Snow back at each other's throats. After some bickering, Snow killed BS. Then Nameless challenges Snow and kills her as she is weakened by her emotions. The King nods, and then says he thinks Nameless is full of lies and tells him what he thinks really happened. We get to hear the story from Nameless, the King and finally the truth. It's a nice little story, but in the end, it's just a crappy fairy tale for the most part. The story is very run of the mill, even if the whole perspectives thing may be interesting for a while, it eventually gets boring to see the same thing over and over and over again with the only difference being a slight costume change. The actual story is a bedtime tale. This one drags like that dog from National Lampoon's Vacation.Action: 0/2.5: OK, I may have loved the Crazy 88 in Kill Bill. I loved it dearly. It obeyed the laws of gravity, something this movie does not attempt to do. The action is more some kind of ballet than real action. The beauty of the surroundings is flaunted too many times and leaves the action in the backseat. The whole flying thing takes any tension that was possible and throws it down the drain. It's tough to get into an action scene that is supposed to be artistic.Here's a case in point. In one scene between Ziyi and Cheung, they fight in a forest in autumn. Now, the whole flying leaves thing is beautiful for a while, but it's hard to get into the action if you can't freaking see it.Then there's a scene involving jumping on water that's not only unbelievable to a fault, but repetitive.Also, let's not forget seeing BS and Snow laying the smackdown on an entire army who apparently falls down before it's their turn and have shields that couldn't defend against a paper airplane.Don't even get me started on that whole arrow repelling thing. You know, just because it's Chinese and crazy doesn't mean that it has an excuse to be crappy. An artsy sword flick can be just as much of a stupid action flick as Walking Tall.Acting: .3/2.5: Everyone in this movie is one dimensional. Basically the only person with any emotion in the whole flick is Tony Leung. While I may not be the best judge of acting in Mandarin, I can still tell when someone has the skills of cardboard.Entertainment: 0/2.5: Hero is meant for artsy people and those who are stoned. If you're stoned, you'll get a kick out of the pretty colours. That's about as far as the entertainment value goes.Bonus+.5 for the cinematography: OK, this movie has some beautiful cinematography. It doesn't matter in the long run, but it does showcase a lot of pretty colours. -.1 for this: In one flashback involving the King fighting Broken Sword, the King runs through a bunch of green things looking for him, but when he's running, he makes a weird noise that sounds like he's revving a car. It's funny, but it's stupid.Total: 11%: Just because Hero's from China doesn't mean you aren't just another stupid action flick. I guarantee if it was exactly the same, except American made and in English, no one would like it. Sure, it looks good, but that means near diddly. If I wanted art, I'd go to a museum. Hero is just a bunch of pretty colours and once you get past that, you have a shallow plot, over exaggerated action and one-dimensional acting. Curse you Tarantino for bringing this one overseas!",Hero
135,miken-3,Much better than Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon!,10,24 January 2005,"First off, this movie is way better than Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. The fact that it is based on a legend in China makes it even better. Some of the most amazing directing and fight scenes I have ever seen. The fighting is about 95% with swords (Kung Fu wasn't invented until many centuries later) but it is spectacular nonetheless.Jet Li is a warrior who supposedly has killed three assassins who were trying to kill the emperor. As a reward, he is invited to the emperor's home (it is not really a palace but a big building) and allowed to approach the emperor within 10 paces (nobody else may come within 100 paces).He is given riches and must tell the tale how he disposed of the 3 assassins. The tale is told 3 different ways. Each time the director uses different colors. First, yellow and red, then green, and finally white. Each story is very different. The tension builds to a highly climatic and unexpected ending.Not to be missed!",Hero
136,HanShotFirstGR,The most beautiful movie of all time!,10,6 January 2021,"Plot:A defense officer, Nameless, was summoned by the King of Qin regarding his success of terminating three warriors.Analysis:The beauty of Asian cinema is sometimes way beyond the limits of imagination, it takes some simple stories or ideas and takes them to a whole new artistic level. Hero is the masterpiece that Yimou Zhang gave everything he had, a form of art far more beutiful that anything a person can experience, it highlights the visual beauty of color, it focuses on the environment and turns a simple, interesting story into the best Chinese movie ever made. It's not just a form of expression, it takes some special talent to visualize ideas, feelings and situations beyond that unoriginal realism that Hollywood applies in every non sci-fi film.The story is pretty simple, Jet Li plays a man named Nameless who is summoned by the king for his success on executing three dangerous people. It's an idea that in paper could seem a little generic, not something that would fit a movie with that reputation and surely even after you watch this movie it won't be the plot that will make you love it, because it actually doesn't have to. The plot is just the canvas for the artist to create, Yimou uses a not so complicated story, to have some steady foundation where he can built his dream and he succeded in every possible way. Depsite that, you can find some very interesting character moments, messages and some great development, it's not something with no soul or nothing to say, it's a very good story, just not a mindblowing one.Wuxia films can be a little bit over the top for the largest part of western audience, this use of unrealistic movement and fighting is a technique that mainstream cinema in west doesn't use at all and feels way too new for many viewers. These moves are a way of expression, this genre has an anthemic tone that almost belongs to fantasy movies, this pleasing harmony between the person and everything that surounds it, it's like dancing and although unnatural is something that should be seen as what it is and not be judged with western cinema standards. Movies like Hero are the closest cinema can get to poetry, an image that reflects on your own ambitions for this film.This is probably the most beautiful movie of all time, it's impossible to look away, the excellent use of colour, these calm and pretty landscape shots, these accurate artistic choices, the set up, the rain, the enviroment, the scenery, the clothing, the fighting, everything works and feels heartwarming. Watching this, is an experience beyond desciption, it's like seeing for the first time, as if you were blind before watching this and now everything is clear, colourful and beautiful, it's not just a movie to entertain you, it's a movie to amaze you and restore your faith in life's beauty.Hero was gifted by great performances too. Jet Li is perfect for the role of Nameless he brings out the confidence of a skillful warrior, the calmness of a brave man and the fire of a person fighting for justice, a truly beutiful interpretation of an idealist. Maggie Cheung was also incredible, her unique fragile beauty and her badass passionate style was a blessing to this movie, her character was everything this film needed, she dominated the screen every time she appreared, the viewer is simply unable to resist her charm and he's left speechless. The main cast was completed by Donnie Yen, Tony Chiu-Wai Leung and Daoming Chen.Conclusion:Words are nothing when they are used to describe this masterpiece, it's a piece of art that you can't criticize, prettier than anything you have ever seen, mature, deep and influencial.

137,Soysoy,Most beautiful martial arts kitsch opera to date,7,28 January 2007,"Without the breathtaking visuals of the lake scenes, that are truly visionary, and a couple of outstanding pieces in terms of color in movement (but I've seen better from Yimou, in ""Raise the red lanterns""), this movie would just be another of these Chinese kitsch martial arts operas. Posters in motion. Clean, dis-incarnated, pretty, empty, forgettable.The History/Magick story is mundane and relies on tired clichés that even the cheapest Asian TV series treat with more wit, but it's not the point anyway. In such a movie, the story is a mere pretext, a distant annotation to please the masses, for the director to have his real fun in creating a dary audiovisual vocabulary that at the same time enthralls and annoys.The problems is that most of the ""beauty"" pictured is, actually, mere aesthetic bombast, this being underlined by countless pretentious slow-motion shots, the melodramatic score, and by the very unnatural looking wirework, with movements that look utterly phony. At least most of it.But there's a payoff. It's not long, but it turns the whole movie into a rewarding experience.When the film reached what I guess was Yimou's original vision, the lake scenes, my jaw dropped. This is terrific stuff, really admirable. The level of abstraction of the movement, and the celebration of the beauty and power of nature, in these scenes, are astounding. The characters are extensions of their environment, so are their spirits and their blades. For a short time, we viewers experience pure grace, genuine transcendence.Too bad that the rest of the movie is mostly an empty hull.I still prefer Hsia Nu (Touch of Zen) by a fair margin. It reaches the same heights without resorting to kitsch and trendy clip-like tricks.",Hero
138,Anyanwu,Beautiful and complex.,10,29 August 2004,"This film is visually beautiful and its story complex.  The visually stunning aspect is something that one can only describe in words and those who have no sight would need a great wordsmith to give true weight to the beauty of HERO.  This, no doubt, will be the focus of countless critiques of HERO.  But what enhances the visual beauty is the complex nature of the story.  The taboo of American screenwriting, flashbacks within flashbacks are used liberally.  The idea of the unreliable narrator takes you on an ""thinking"" trip.  As the stories weave in and out of each other and different scenarios are presented to you, your mind is working while at the same time you are inundated with the visual ""look"" of what is on screen.  I will close my critique in linking this Chinese film to the great Japanese filmmaker Kurosawa,  With that said anyone who reads this will, if they have an inkling of the greatness of Kurosawa, rush to see this epic of honor, nobility and passion. All should heed the words of another IMDB critic blakndn on a critique of this film.",Hero
139,Pingo-2,Good.,6,7 November 2003,"I've seen better films with Jet Li. I've seen better films with (Maggie) Cheung Man-Yuk. I've seen better films with (Tony) Leung Chiu Wai. I've seen better films made by Zhang Yimou.With that said, HERO (Ying Xiong) is a GOOD film. It could have been much better though.What the movie lacks in plot it adds in action sequences, slow-motion and experimental color corrections. The color corrections are so well used that to the end we can clearly see that they haven't really worked on it as well as they should have. Face-colors, something that is very important, changes between scenes, since they have added to much magenta in one scene and yellow in another. Tweaking one color, without trying to keep the skin tone at one level, makes the all out color correction look like it was made by an intern. It isn't well done. Maybe Zhang Yimou tries a little bit too hard.The action scenes are nice. Not as cool as in early (1992-1995) Hong Kong movies with Maggie Cheung and Anita Mui, but they are at least nice to look at.The story is told in flashbacks. If you make a movie all told in flashbacks you really need to have a good reason for it. The reason why a character in a film is in a special state of life is not important - what we are interested in is the journey there. But we don't know the end before the tale begins. That is the bad thing about flashbacks.Yimou tells the complete film with flashbacks (and flashbacks in the flashbacks). It's not confusing, because he use other colors on the clothes for each flashback scene/world. That is nice. But it isn't fun either. Actually, when we have seen one hour of this movie, we are pretty fed up with being told the same thing over and over.The movie is really only a very short tale that would have been very interesting to see if it was a short-film. But stretched out to a feature - no. The screenplay is this films most low part.Zhang Yimou have added several humours elements to the film. That is good. Actually, all the comedy is what makes this film worth watching.This film could have been so much better. But Yimou is not an action director, Jet Li isn't a drama performer and quite frankly, Ziyi Zhang isn't a good actress.People who think this film is ""sooo good"" and ""sooo beautiful"" haven't seen anything else from China or Asia. They probably are totally stunned by the wire-performances and the neat package, and are too busy reading the subtitles to understand that this film isn't nearly as good as ""they say"". We have had the same problem before with the REALLY BAD movie CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON. But that film lacked everyhting, so in comparission, HERO is very good.To be honest, I was dissapointed. HERO is probably the lamest movie Zhang Yimou ever made, and a low point in all the casts careers. That is sad. Because the sets, the idea, the filming - that is all impressive. The colors, the action and the screenplay need more work.Seek out the early films by Zhang Yimou, Jet Li and Maggie Cheung to see good and cool movies instead.6 out of 10 because of some of the technics.",Hero
140,westpenn49,"More Maggie, less movie",6,4 September 2004,"Maggie Cheung looking in to see her lover in bed with another is captured perfectly in the light from the screen. It is perhaps one of the most beautiful scenes in the entire movie. It is also about where I began to get weary.There is really nothing new in Hero. The courtyard with thousands of warriors was done better with the real life participation of the Red Army in the Last Emperor (a fitting contrast to this the story of the first Emperor) the sword play that was imaginative and innovative in Crouching Tiger is a bit yesterday, and repetitive here. The story is good enough though huge holes appear in the end and one wonders why the story must end exactly as it does. Death is always senseless, but in this case the death of one character is uncalled for, it advances nothing, the character essentially dies for nothing. Other deaths make sense but this one is just dumb. If you see the picture you will know which one I mean. OK, I think you get the picture.If there is a real star to this movie, it is as usual Ms. Cheung. She is an incredible presence in her every scene. The writing does not always work for her, however, we have no clue why she is so adamant about not providing red ink, maybe I just need to learn Mandarin but It would have been nice to get a clue as to what was going on. If it was just to fit the story in which the scene was set, it still needed explanation.Too bad, it was a pretty picture.",Hero

Probably worth a viewing, but slightly disappointing. The following review will tell you why. Hero is told as a story, basically about a sword. Sequence after sequence explains what has happened in the life of Nameless (Jet Li). This film is shot beautifully, with perhaps the best cinematography ever. Despite this, it feels slightly unsatisfying whilst being viewed. There is nothing particularly wrong with Yimou Zhang's effort, it just isn't great. And definitely not as good as it should have been. When looking at the poster advertising the film, it looks brilliant. But when watching it you'll find it's not as great. Bizarre really, not for any real particular reason, just not great. Hmmm. Overall: *** out of ***** (3 out of 5)",Hero

I will give you one caveat, if you can't deal with wire effects and the idea that people could be so skilled they could walk on water etc then don't go see this film.  Of course that said, why can most of the people like that except a flying guy (superman) , a guy that swings through cities on strings (spiderman), etc, etc..This is an awesome movie, for me a 10 out of 10.

143,imxo,The Real Message of This Chinese Film: Individualism Must Be Crushed,6,27 August 2004,"HERO is a visually satisfying film - glorious colors, diaphanous, flowing garments, exotic scenery, and some of the best - if not the best - computer-enhanced sword fighting scenes ever filmed. The film even purports to have a spiritual message of sorts: that renunciation of violence and a yielding to the will of the King is the road to happiness - how Gandhi-like, but how strange when coming from the Chinese. However, there is a darker message here, too.If you look at the real philosophy behind this film it is this: no matter how justified the cause, no matter how heroic the individuals, the state must ultimately triumph in order to secure a greater good for all. Individualism must be crushed, no matter how heroic it may seem. As incongruous as it may seem when attending this kind of fantasy film, watching this movie's army of ancient Chinese archers flooding the skies with tens of thousands of well-aimed arrows - and a spectacular sight it is, too - brings immediately to mind the current Chinese Communist regime's threat to rain down a flood of missiles on Taiwan, should that island insist on declaring its total independence from China. Gee, I hadn't expected to be inundated with political thoughts when I went to see this movie, but I just couldn't avoid it. Show the courage of the students in Tien An Men Square and the King or State will reward you with the glorious death you apparently so yearn for. And all this is packaged in a film that is supposed to be an ancient martial arts fantasy.Frankly, despite the wonderful sound track of the film and the fantastic scenes of sword-fighters flying through the air, I think that this film doesn't compare entirely well with its famous predecessor, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. HERO is just a bit too good in the computer department; a but too slick. Still, it's a very impressive film, indeed. Perhaps even more impressive is to see a packed theater of average American movie-goers watching almost two hours of a sub-titled Chinese Mandarin film. For me, that is the most amazing thing of all. Finally, let me criticize the theater in which I saw this film, the Silverado in San Antonio, Texas. The film was entirely too dark, and those glorious colors in the film were nowhere near as brilliant and bright as they should have been. At times the films sets were so dark as to be almost black along the edges of the screen. I know the film was not made this way, and I can only assume that the management of the theater is using bulbs of too low a wattage in their projector. It took the pleasure out of what should have been a visually glorious film.",Hero
144,miro-6,Magic movie,9,30 August 2004,"People rated this movie 8.5 on the opposite the posts  very often are tough. For me this movie is magic. The use of the colors is really fantastic. Everything you see is made by great taste. The battles are impressive and the duels are beautiful. The acting is very very good. I don't agree with who says that this movie is philosophically wrong because tales without criticism about the 1st selfnominated Emperor Shi Huangdi who was a bloody dictator. The philosophy Ghandi style of Broken Sword is the real message of the movie. The nameless warrior don't get a name because he is just the metaphoric representation of the nemesis. Believe me this is a great great movie. It sounds to me very strange that ""Hero"" needed two years to find a distribution in the USA and it gets so poor advertising. That means that distributors are blind. In my opinion this movie is very better than ""Crouching Tiger..."". Usually I like fast action movies but this was so magic! Unfortunately actors speak Chinese with English subtitles and sometimes reading takes away your attention from the scenes, any the way I rate ""Hero"" 9/10.",Hero
145,RestlessRust,Possibly the Year's Best Movie,10,18 September 2004,"About halfway through the film, as Broken Sword considers the betrayal he just experienced, I was engulfed by the feeling of ""this is why you go to a movie.""""Hero"" is beautiful, heartbreaking, thrilling and thoughtful. The screen is constantly full of breath-taking images and perfectly balanced throughout. If you're going to watch a full-screen version of this, don't waste your time. The composition of each shot is so perfect that any hack job will only make you wonder what everyone is so hyped up about.And the story--wow! I expected a straight-forward action movie, but ""Hero"" has more twists than all of M. Night Shyamalan's films combined. Is Jet Li's nameless character a hero, or does he have a secret agenda? Is the emperor a caring leader or a maniacal dictator? Just when you think you know the answer, another twist unfolds.Some may dismiss this movie with words like ""propaganda,"" but don't be fooled. No character in this movie makes a choice lightly. The cost of every decision is weighed heavily, and Nameless recognizes that his ultimate decision will lead to less than perfect results. Still, the ideal is there, and it is an ideal that transcends time and culture. The ultimate moral of the story is hardly a call to arms but a reminder that war doesn't lead to peace; peace comes from a vision in which war has no part. That's not propaganda. That's a message of hope in an imperfect world.",Hero
146,aeo,Pretty picture but typical Hong Kong film,1,1 September 2004,"The only reason why I am commenting is because this movie is currently opening all across the US.  I saw this movie about 2 years ago when I was on a business trip to Hong Kong.  First of all, I am not a fan of the martial arts film where people are flying all over the place, regardless how pretty it might seem.  Second, I generally like realism in my martial arts movies, although I love those Hong Kong martial arts movies from the 1970's and 1980's.  I can accept certain amount of exaggeration for action sake but not flying like Superman.If you like Crouching Tiger Hidden Tiger, then you should like this movie although the former movie, in my opinion, had more of a story than this movie.  For those of you who do not know about Chinese history, around 500 BC to 300 or so BC, was called the warring states.  China had splintered into various feudal kingdoms with constant warfare being the norm.  Towards the latter part of this period, one kingdom began to dominate the others, which would eventually unify all of the feudal kingdoms.  Some of these kingdoms sent assassins to kill the future emperor of China.  One of the assassins is played by Jet Li.  His mission is to kill this new leader of this powerful kingdom.This type of martial arts movies have great cinematography but that is about it for me.  I am more partial to martial arts films such as Yojimbo or Game of Death.  Therefore, if you are like me and do not like martial artist flying like Superman, avoid it, but if you liked Crouching Tiger Hidden Tiger, then go see.  Better yet, go to your neighborhood Asian video store near you and rent it.  They should have it given this movie was release in other parts of the globe 2 years ago.  I am not sure if your Blockbuster video would carry this because the movie is currently playing in US theaters.",Hero

148,cleary-joshua,"'Hero' is my introduction to the genre, and not a bad film to start with at all...",8,27 October 2013,"I should probably admit first off that the 'martial arts' film genre is one that is very new to me. In fact, Chinese cinema itself is something that I haven't properly experienced before. Therefore, 'Hero' was my introduction into both of these genres, and to be honest, it's not a bad film to start with at all. It's highly stylised, beautifully shot, and has some fantastic action sequences. It's also got a really interesting narrative technique, presenting three different accounts of the same story, which is both unusual and very effective.The movie is set in ancient China, when the country was divided into warring states. It stars Jet Li as ""Nameless"", a hero who visits the king of the 'Qin' state claiming to have killed three assassins who have previously made an attempt on the king's life. For the first third of the film, we see flashbacks to these killings as Nameless tells his story to the king. These flashbacks contain some great fight scenes – it's all very over the top, but things like the occasional use of slow motion don't feel at all unnecessary, and it keeps you interested. The king doesn't trust Nameless' story, and gives his own view on what really happened, and following this, Nameless gives him the truth. The narrative technique is really fascinating, and it never really feels like we're getting the same story told to us three times, since each time is visually and narratively different. The film ends with a final great fight scene, and an interesting moral question that is posed by Nameless' actions.The thing that makes the film so beautiful and captivating is Yimou Zhang's use of colour and imagery. When the fight takes place in the chess hall, everything around is black or grey, and later on he fills whole scenes with just whites, reds or blues. Each scene is like a painting, and everything is visually stunning. The scale of the film is also incredible, with huge crowd scenes and amazing visual effects. The scene where Nameless and Broken Sword are fighting on the perfectly still lake is both awe-inspiring and exciting. At times it's more like ballet than fighting, and I think the blurred line between them is what makes the film so exquisite.If you've never seen a martial arts film before, 'Hero' is a great place to start. The one problem I had with the film was due to my viewing it with non-Chinese eyes – there were many cultural references that I didn't understand which slightly marred my overall view of the film. However, it's a stunning film, and worth putting time into.",Hero

I believe slow motion does not work for every scene and sequence of fights is less or not entertaining or thrilling at all. Some are OK. But not in all the movie. Sensations: Sleepy. Boring. Tense. In the sky. Energetic and yes, entertaining at last. There was a point when I said to myself: bye bye, too boring and if I want to see a soap opera,not in the cinema.

150,Clothahump,A very good movie except for the wirework,9,6 September 2004,"Hero is a classic Chinese drama/tragedy. Comparisons to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon will be made, but the two movies are very different. The cinematography in Hero was better and the tale is told in mostly flashback as opposed to ""realtime"" in CTHD.I must admit, though, that I think the wire work detracts horribly from the grace and beauty of the martial arts scenes. I really don't know why Chinese directors are so enamored by it, and unfortunately American directors are becoming more enamored with it, too. And to be bluntly honest, this movie could have used at least one unarmed combat scene, instead of being all weapons.",Hero
151,gentendo,Tragic Hero Excellence,10,20 September 2008,"In Hero, Nameless is portrayed as an exceptional assassin whose talents for martial arts and guile exceed that of his friends and enemies. His stealth allows him to always be one step ahead of them. By orchestrating an extraordinary plan to restore peace and unity between the people of Qin and Zhao, Nameless fabricates multiple stories of his having killed the greatest assassins in the land; all for the objective of getting nearer towards the king of Qin. By moving nearer towards the king in his own palace, Nameless comes closer to killing the kingan objective which, if fulfilled, will seemingly abolish tyranny and restore unity in China.However, I will not endorse Nameless' tragic flaw as being that he did not succeed in killing the kingthat would be too obvious. In fact, I do not believe it was ever Nameless' intention to kill the king; he is too intelligent to not know that violence does not solve violence. Although it may have appeared that this was his objective, I argue that he only had to make the king think that he was going to kill him. By doing so, Nameless then creates the façade of having those around him think that he is dangerous. Since anything that appears dangerous before the king must be eliminated, Nameless must be eliminated.Nameless thus becomes the sacrificial lamb of the filmthe tragic hero. He knew what he was doing when he first entered the palace; he was the author and finisher of his fate by sealing it with his own blood. No one could take his life from him other than his freely giving up his life for the cause of establishing unity in the land. However, he knew he had to be made an example for everyone else who attempted to defy the king. If Nameless could not succeed in overthrowing the king, no one could. I mean, should we really think that he couldn't have killed the king if he wanted to? Furthermore, should we really think that his death by arrows couldn't have been prevented by all of his cool flying and dodging tricks? I doubt so. Nameless did not change his initial objective: to help the king realize that he had to kill the greatest assassin in the land, namely Nameless. He succeeded in developing this realization inside the king. Thus, the only tragic flaw in Nameless is that he dies before witnessing the reformation of the peace and unity which subsequently followed his death. His fate is sealed in his death because he inevitably followed through with his plan independent of anyone intelligent enough to thwart him. It was a brilliant finish to his well laudable and pitied feat. I say 'pity' because his actions were truly heroic and yet we have no way to thank him for his courage and loyalty to the land.Nature is beautifully captured in this film to help support the internal/external theme of the struggling characters: only when the inner vessel is in harmony will the outer vessel (nature) be too in harmony. In other words, the inner struggle between the characters who want the king dead versus those who don't is a reflection of the outer and current state of their society as a wholea divided mess. Zhang Yimou helps emphasize this internal and external struggle by using immaculate colors to dress the scenes. Each color gives a certain emotion that we are to feel towards how each character is changing. Just as each character wants to reconcile differences and restore peace, the land (nature) also wants reconciliation. The land is like a metaphor for what is taking place inside the characters. If the land is unified, the people are unified and vice versa. This is the reason why there is so much imagery of nature in the film; it's as if Yimou is trying to say that the land and the people are one in the same, both trying to establish peace and unity.",Hero
152,veganflimgeek,Better than CTHD on many levels.,10,7 December 2003,"As a huge fan of Hero and CTHD I would like to avoid comparing them but that is of course impossible. Crouching tiger is a great film and indeed hero would never have been funded without it, but hero is a better film.Hero besides amazing visuals including the the shifting colors and computer enhanced images is a piece of film art that is hard to explain. So much deeper than a a love story, a swordplay film or a technical masterpiece...it is pure cinema. Jet Li has the performance of his life. While is well respected for martial arts he is underrated for his acting. The whole cast plays pitch perfect. Donnie Yen and Jet have what I think is the most stylish fight in film history(not the best just coolest looking).If you are desperate to get this feeling again also check the film Musa. Which is also high class sword epic.****spoiler*****At first I was bothered by the political message which seemed to be saying ""might makes right"" but after watching the film several times i realized that is not exactly the message. I think Yimou wanted the chinese government money and having nationalist message about China appealed to them.
However to a viewer with a keen eye the films message is mixed. Flying snow resists domination until the end even though her lover has excepted the domination.  While the message looks like ""all under one heaven"" on the surface the story to me is about the struggles and conflicts that come along with nationalism. Qin and the assassins are just indivduals who we watch face off over those conflicts.",Hero
153,benjamin_lappin,Championing A Cause For Style When Done With Substance,8,31 May 2007,"If you are too watch just one martial arts come period drama film from Eastern Asia, forget Crouching Tiger, and understand what's in a name because Hero is a blistering, captivating film in very similar, and yet very different, ways to its predecessor. In what can only be described as an unintended triumvirate of films, Hero chooses to take the path declined by House Of Flying Daggers and concentrate more on the visual aesthetics of the film, rather than its story, although this is not to say its plot is obsolete, far from it.One of 'the' most beautiful films of all time is praise often heaped upon this film, and to an extent they are not far wrong. There is only one adjective enough to describe Hero in merely one word, and that is lavish. Everything about this film is done with dignity, restraint and above all a very Easternised philosophy, yet manages to garner a feel of epic proportions. Hero, tells the story of a nameless warrior who travels to the King of Qin to alert his Lord that he has vanquished three assassins that have haunted him for many a year, and prevent him from being able to fulfil his dream of united all the kingdoms of China under one banner. What occurs next are a series of flashbacks coupled with an explanation of the nameless warrior of how he managed to trick his enemies into lowering their defences and thus make themselves ripe for the taking. Before the real flashback story telling commences, Nameless (Jet Li) breaks into a fight with one of the assassins 'Sky' (Donnie Yen) and thus the directors intentions are revealed. In contrast to House Of Flying Daggers, the action sequences manage to further the storyline, and in a story where ridding a king of three assassins is the basic gist of the plot, fighting is somewhat essential. All these combat sequences are done with purpose and are shot sumptuously. They are never rushed and feel apart of the moving painting which Hero ends up becoming. Once Nameless has recalled his tale to the King, the King proposes an alternative theory as to what he thinks 'actually' happened, and from there on the true genius of this films cinematography is revealed.The Director waited patiently to use the real life locations in his shots, as the lake used was only still for two hours every day, and he had a man on a telephone waiting by the trees in the sequence with Maggie Cheung and Zhang Ziyi to let him know when the leaves were blossoming. Hero feels exceptionally well thought out and meticulously hand crafted, yet it is the colours, so ravish and engrossing, and their usage that stand out in my mind. Never before in cinema has colour been used so symbolically and as a means to further a story, which for all the talk of it being somewhat undeveloped is drafted well enough to flow throughout and achieve its ultimate purpose. Hero is a wonderful film, and it goes without saying the greatest work Quentin Tarantino has done since Pulp Fiction, to this day, was convince the studio executives into bringing this spectacle to western audiences, and if it weren't for films like Hostel, he'd be a hero too.",Hero

I thought the key factors in this film was the direction, photography and good support cast.I was surprised with the amount of people who who were in the cinema laughing EVERY time the fights had flying etc in them!

160,tresdodge,"Nope, over pretentious and boring",1,15 October 2004,"Despite the incredible reviews and perhaps ever so slightly because of them I was let down by this movie. I did'nt enjoy 'Sleeping Tiger...' which many had compared to this and I found this very boring with monotonous scene after scene of dull but nicely shot fighting. I was able to see a homage to the far superior Kurosawas 'Roshomon' in narrative structure but found this to be feeble and overrated to say the least. It just did not do it for me and was oh so pretentious, and far too slow. I did however appreciate the cinematography and the good visual experience this film had created, yet I just could not get into it all. It did'nt really contain any deepness for me all seeming rather shallow and pointless.",Hero
161,cgtam,Cinematography at its finest; film as art.,10,7 February 2021,"This artistic action film has it all, a true feast for eyes & mind. Great plot, acting, action & stunning beauty from start to finish. Put aside the politics & enjoy this epic story with all its breathtaking beauty & creative action. Nothing here is routine. As a westerner, I truly dislike subtitles. But there's little reading here, as one sees the tales explained mostly by action & drama- not many words needed. Hearing the actors true voices adds to the drama- no chatter heads here.
Allow yourself to be submerged in fantasy- little CGI, just incredible vision delivered by the director, actors & photography director. Jet Li is in fine martial arts form, just like his co-stars for the action fight scenes. The use of colors, flowing garments & hair, use of nature, camera angles, backgrounds, costumes, sets, wire work are all exceptional & uniquely beautiful.
Plot: Pre Dynasty China, 2000 plus years ago, Jet Li plays a man who tells a king how he obtains 3 rare weapons the king desires. The tale is then retold by the king's view, & the viewer later sees the truth. The 3 versions do NOT repeat in any way- it's 3 different tales, each uniquely portrayed beautifully, in unforgettable cinematic epic format with matching soundtrack. Some of the music is a bit odd to westerners but it works because it's faint background, not foreground sound. Nowhere does the movie get slow or feel dragged out, & it's not a typical ending. There's plot twists & humor too.
It's a shame China does not allow these films deemed ""nationalistic"" to be made anymore. It's based on some historic facts but is a fictional story. This film proves nudity, sex & gore, nor blasting sound effects are NOT needed to show full range of human emotions, thrilling action. The best in the Asian film business was required to create this form of ART. To take it all in, one will want to watch it again.",Hero

This movie has increased my estimation of action film actors and directors. I loved the twists, I loved the entire plot. Watch it once for the love of the movie, then watch it again to fully understand just how complicated it must have been to film this movie. I highly recommend the DVD.

164,pmcollectorboy,Absolutely NOT better than CTHD(spoilers),4,19 September 2004,"Oh my did the critics ever get it wrong with this one. I'm not a big fan of martial arts films or of Jet Li, but I loved Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and I went to see this on the recommendation of my sister, who said it was better than Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Plus it got a good rating from TV Guide, a source I trust the most out of all the review sites. Not only was Hero inferior to Crouching Tiger, Hidden, but it was one of the most horrifyingly pretentious, stuffy, and self-important movies I've ever seen. While Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon gave us characters that we could care about, had a sweeping sense of grace and beauty, and allowed us to get emotionally absorbed into their world even outside the fight scenes, Hero merely gave us overwrought icons and a backwards tracking plot that allowed the main story to stay stuck within the same scene for the entire movie. The reward for the audience's patience is something of a puzzle for me, and I'm having a hard time figuring out what the big deal. The title of the movie is called ""Hero"", and yet everybody dies and the villain wins. And the movie justifies this by spouting out some imperialist propaganda stating that the only way through peace and unification is through an evil act.Like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Hero has that fancy wire fu flying and tries too hard to be philosophical. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, however, is also refreshingly straightforward, easy to follow, and is beautiful in its portrayal of martial arts, the world, and its romance. Hero, on the other hand, gets bogged down in heavy themes and merely loves to hear the sound of its own voice. The fight scenes don't work as well as in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and one or maybe more fight scenes seem to serve no purpose. Hero is, indeed, beautiful and certainly more intelligent than the average Jet Li flick. But all this color and flair is put to no practical or entertainment purpose. I'd rather a movie be just a little bit shallow and bubblegum feeling and be entertaining(like The Matrix movies) than be too intelligent and seem stuffy. But what do I know? All the critics loved it, so maybe you might too. I'll stick to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Heck, even Brotherhood of the Wolf is better than Hero.",Hero
165,elu5iv3,Mind-blowingly beautiful...,9,24 July 2003,"Hero: 9/10They say that this movie will exceed Crouching Tiger for popularity of an eastern movie in the west. ""Hero"" starred Jet Li and several other big names in a big budget (US$30,000,000, which is probably huge for that region) blockbuster. This is an amazing experience, largely because of the greatest cinematography I have ever seen in a movie. Some of it was just jaw-dropping, such as a forest changing colours, a spar on a perfect lake, thousands of soldiers acting in unison, even seeing a character practicing caligraphy, too much to name. The movie had a very interesting storyline that I won't spoil, as it takes quite a twist, and is also philosophical and thought-provoking. The fight scenes deserve special mention, because they were blowaway great and didn't drag like some (like those in Matrix Reloaded) can. My main fault with this movie was the length - at 93 minutes, it was too short, but apparently a special edition with 21 extra minutes of character development is being released. This was a beautiful movie in many ways, and one everyone should see. It's set for a November release at cinemas in the U.S., so go see it unless you can get the import DVD before then!",Hero

But, in all the fanfares and appreciations of this gorgeous palate of cinematic primary coloration's, it seems to me two very important points are bypassed: 1: If, indeed, the ""hero"" was prefigured by a prior hero who had the Ch'in emperor within range of his sword, why is his story relevant? 2: The historical? figure of the Ch'in originating Yellow? King was not simply a tyrant, but a scholar murderer as well as a book-burner.

Because people can jump and do stupid stunts like run on wind? These are some of the worst films ever made, the stunts are laughable and they serve no purpose whatsoever. Just because a movie has stunts and people can fly, for no explained reason, doesn't make it a good movie. This is a travesty. This movie has absolutely no plot. No plot...I don't care if people say there is one, I lost track of everything in the first 5 minutes.

168,segratz,A Great Foreign Film,8,30 August 2004,"This is a beautiful film, with imaginative and unique visuals. Initially I thought the film would probably be a serious fight-a-thon with probably little plot to recommend it, but it is more the other way around. It has a very stirring, emotional story that takes some time to get into. However, once you see where it's all going you begin to become more and more intrigued. Don't get me wrong - there is plenty of serious fighting. Most Americans probably dislike all the flying wire work but they should keep in mind that this has been done in Asian cinema for a long time - it's a part of their movie culture. I'm a big fan - I think it makes the fighting magical, kind of like what you wish you really could do in a fight but can't. I don't need to see brash REAL fighting (like in Fight Club) - that kind of stuff is just gruesome for the sheer testosterone shock value. So here in 'Hero' we have those cool and interesting sword fighting scenes that I enjoy. The best is between two of the women and when you see the movie you'll know what I'm talking about. If you enjoy foreign films than SEE THIS MOVIE. Don't like them? Then I don't recommend it.

Each flashback is a joy to watch simply because of that beauty and it's the beauty that keeps you watching.The storyline itself is contrived at points, but I can forgive that because this is meant to be a parable, and the movie ends so well I found myself not caring. There are times during the movie where emotion is lacking even though those should be the most passionate times. I have a feeling that is a directing or editing error though, because the actors are all marvelously in tune with what they should be feeling- something that changes a lot in this movie.Crouching Tiger wins against this movie. Ang Lee's movie has both stirring visuals and an assured, passionate story. Hero, however, is definitely worth watching and I recommend it to anyone who loves these Chinese martial arts movies.",Hero
170,bluzman,Wonderful Fiction,9,10 August 2003,"This is a marvelous movie; very stylish, complex and beautiful. It moves with polish and grace, which is remarkable for a movie with as much invested in fighting scenes.  It is everything that illuminates why Gladiator was a boring, predictable, ponderous, uninspired tome, and why Crouching Tiger was a masterpiece.The staging was huge and detailed.  The costumes and backdrops are stunning. The settings for several of the scenes are in some of China's/the world's most exotic locales like the River Li near Guilin, Jiuzhaigou (the lake in the fighting scene) and the Gobi of XinJiang Province, and more.Many others have made the inevitable comparison to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, so I will as well.  Some of the effects and visualization in this movie surpass Crouching Tiger, as well they should since they are using the technology of that movie plus updated systems.  I did not find the depth of the story to be quite as good.  One of Crouching Tiger's best aspects was the way it wove 3 stories (the two love stories and the story about duty and honor) together into one cohesive movie.  But it was still good!!!Also, this movie kind of had the ""Disney Effect"".  One of the great things about many of the finer Chinese movies is their faithfulness to trying to accurately tell true stories.  Examples of such are Farewell, My Concubine, The King Of Masks and the movie/story that this movie used, The Emperor and the Assassin (which is a far more historically accurate rendition of this story).If you are a fan of good movies and are not scared off by subtitles.  This is a movie that could easily amaze you and find its way onto your all-time best foreign movies list.Within its genre 9/10",Hero

I felt that Hero had a very tight story line, about a man (Nameless) trying to assassinate the first Emperor.  I really liked how they recalled each of the events in the past, at a slightly different angle and viewpoint. It reminded me of Run Lola Run a bit, which is another film I really liked.2. The colors and cinematography in this movie was just AMAZING!  It was on par or even better than Crouching Tiger's3.  The fight scenes in here are full, complete, and not short and broken like Crouching...4. The one thing I REALLY liked about the movie was how it made us look at something from a different view point (which I think is what this movie is all about).  Different people have completely different interpretations of a single event.  Even though the First Emperor has always been a villan in Chinese history, and done a lot of very terrible things, the way the movie portrays him brings out a very valid opposing view.  Yes, unification of a country is a very hard thing to do, and one has to take certain measure to do it.  Could we blame him for what he did, as it led to one of the golden ages in China (The Han dynasty) shortly after?  Who knows, since it's all 2000+ years in the past.  All in all, this was a brilliant film, and I wished it came out before Crouching Tiger so it could have gotten more buzz instead of being called a ""copy cat"" movie... Cheers! 10/10 Kryzak",Hero

174,dragonshield,Eloquent beauty in a flawlessly composed tranquility,8,4 September 2007,"I remember watching this movie many times before, but only clips from it, so I had never seen it all the way through. Now, as the proud owner of the DVD, I finally saw it straight through and I was also very pleased on the overall result. ""Ying xiong"" aka ""Hero"" is indeed a great movie and a startlingly beautiful one as well. The story is based in ancient China, before the reign of the first emperor, warring factions throughout the Six Kingdoms plot to assassinate the most powerful ruler, Qin. When a minor official defeats Qin's three principal enemies, he is summoned to the palace to tell Qin the story of his surprising victory.The story, with all its twists and turns, is very well written and it's a true epic, in a way that I personally love. It has a very good catch and you can't really see what'll be the final solution before the very end of the movie. There's also this unique way of using colours; Every time a same, but somehow different, story is told it is also told with different colours, which already by its own gives the movie this ""hook"" to keep the viewer interested. It's very original and prominent, being also visually so effective. The movie is throughout a visual masterpiece and the cinematography is absolutely amazing. As a fan of Asian cinematography I thought some of the scenes were so beautifully shot that it almost made my skin tremble - Those endless landscapes and soothing images truly gives you this heart warming feeling. You just keep on staring the screen because of the unquestionable beauty that flashes through your eyes. Marvellous.""Hero"" also has all in all very solid role performances. Despite the fact of people saying Jet Li can only do martial arts I still think he is great as an actor as well. Look at for example ""Danny the Dog"" (2005) where Jet Li pulled off an amazing role performance. The film industry doesn't let us see that he actually has great acting capabilities, it's just that he doesn't get the opportunity to use them very often. Jet Li was indeed at his best in ""Hero"", both acting and martial arts wise. The rest of the cast does a pretty satisfying job as well, so there isn't anything worth complaining when it comes to that department. The romantic story between Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Maggie Cheung works really well with the main story and the chemistry between them is undeniably a real treat. Ziyi Zhang is the beautiful herself, giving the movie a touch of sensitivity although her character being sometimes filled with anger and hate. Donnie Yen as ""Sky"" does his part and Daoming Chen as the ""King of Qin"" does his, so the role performances the movie offers are handled pretty well and they are also very significant for the whole progress of the film, keeping it in a tight package throughout.The movie is mixed between nice storytelling and phenomenal fighting sequences, that real Asian specimen of skill. I once again thought that the battle scenes (or action scenes if you might call them that) were stunning and truly entertaining. They aren't really actual ""action"" scenes, as all of them are shot in sort of a calm and peaceful way, which fits with the main theme incredibly well. I'm certainly not forgetting the whole beauty of them, as even when the fighting proceeds itself into a fast phased rhythm it's still so serene and when accompanied with the absolutely gorgeous soundtrack composed by Tan Dun it's something that's not easily forgotten. It's like the cinematography; Beautiful, soothing, precise and detailed. Both, the fighting and the cinematography, follow each other in a compelling way and it's really absorbing, a fine achievement indeed.""Ying xiong"" is definitely not an action movie, so everyone who's expecting a mindless action flick will most certainly be disappointed. The film is an excellent example of how great a movie mixed with an epic, dramatic story and outstanding action can be, working really well on both sides and not forgetting either one of the sides to a minor role. It balances both of them and that, if something, deserves an enormous appreciation from me. The movie includes solid performances, mind blowing cinematography, detailed directing, an unique way on how to use storytelling not only as what we've used to but also as a visual way of making the movie itself lively and vivid, giving it an original, yet well crafted out touch. ""Hero"" isn't perfect, but it's still a strong milestone in the Asian film industry and will probably be referred to in the future. Everything still works in a fluent way, so this is one of those fine pieces of film making that everyone should see, hence the ""Asian Masterpieces"" -title in my four-movies-together DVD-box. I personally think this is one of the best Asian pictures made in the 21st century. You may be surprised or you may be not, but in the end you can't deny the beauty of it.",Hero
175,kingbad,"Visually stunning, but ultimately empty",6,23 September 2004,"First, the good news: Ying xiong (Hero) should win all kinds of technical awards for costumes, cinematography, set design, and possibly music (beautiful score, wonderfully performed by Itzhak Perlman). It's simply a beautiful-looking movie, and plenty entertaining if all you're interested in is a series of attractive, unrelated frames of celluloid.Unfortunately, that leads to the bad news: there's no story here!! Or rather, in an aborted attempt to rip off Kirosawa's technique in Roshoman, there are three different versions of the same story, basically hung together as an excuse to have each of the leads fight each other at various times. The dialogue was laughable, the wire work was directly lifted from a lot of other (and better made) martial-arts movies, and the ""gifted"" Jet Li manages to run through the entire gamut of emotions, from A to a slightly different A. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!!And finally, my primary complaint is with the motivations of the characters here. Despite being highly-trained assassins, and very motivated to kill a megalomaniacal King bent on conquering their homeland and/or killing their families, at least two of the characters pass up an opportunity to kill him? WHY??!! Because he's changed? No- as it turns out, he conquers all of their lands, and sets himself up as the first Emperor of China (as revealed in the postscript).

I say that from watching it dozens of times over and over just now, and its subtleties are endless.It's my favourite Chinese movie, and in my Top 10 movies ever, alongside Lonesome Dove, LOTR Extended, Kingdom of Heaven Directors Cut, Kimi no Na Wa, and others.I really love Yimou Zhang's movies, and for me, Hero is definitely his best.",Hero
177,AlienByChoice,How did this pretentious piece of rubbish end up in top 250?!,3,1 January 2008,"Let's start with a disclosure. I am not a martial arts movie fan. In fact, I do not believe that martial arts movies have the right for existence as such. If I want to see pure martial arts I go see a martial arts competition. However, I definitely believe in martial arts as a viable part of a story telling technique.Now lets get to Hero. I think we all know the formula of success for an Asian movie by now. 1) Take a piece of Chinese history, and an associated legend 2) Make it look like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. If I was as pretentious as the movie itself, I would have said ""Make it visually similar to the cinematographic style of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" But I am not as pretentious. 3) Add Tarantino's name to it.Now, to make it better than CTHD. 1) Use an Asian actor who is better known to the American and European audiences. 2) Have more of the ""fly-by-wire"" fights, but in more beautiful locations. 3) Use plenty of pseudo symbolics.Oh, and how could I forget the most important part! Since the average European will have difficulty distinguishing between the various Asian male characters, get them all to have different facial hair styles, just to make them more recognizable.Now to the main part. Why is this a piece of pretentious rubbish? Well, despite the promising settings in feudal China, the story is very weak. Which leaves us with the cinematography and the battles choreography. Cinematography gives us stunning views, and lot's of colour based scenes. We have a red scene, a green scene, a white scene, a... Now, why we have all these scenes is not clear, but they are supposed to be cinematographically (that's not even a real word to be honest) beautiful. They are. Like a beautiful chandelier. A designer bath tub may be. But they have no substance. No emotion behind the colouring and sets and no feelings. Imagine the difference between spotting a beautiful kitchen set and Aivazovski's ""Decuman Wave"" (or any other true work of art), and you will know what I am talking about. Talking about the battles. Let's not talk about them. Slow-mo, hang-by-wire and fly around, clip the water surface with your sword because it makes a beautiful shot, and then go for the standard kill are just not worth talking about.So, to recap - we are talking about pretentious, trying too hard, somewhat beautiful trash.3/10.

I loved the Kurosawa influences. A sea of banners and flags always looks great in the wind.

179,cglassey,"A silly film, not in Crouching Tiger's league...",7,29 July 2003,"This film seems to me to have been made in part because of the success of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. While it shares many good qualities with the famous Ang Wang film, ""Hero"" is not successful as a coherent film.
Hero has many beautiful scenes, it seems to have been created by a painter as different scenes are dominated by one color then another. However, to my eye it seemed far too formal, to arty. For me, Ang Wang's fight scene staged in the bamboo forest works, while Hero's fight scene at a lake just left me unmoved. While parts of the film are enjoyable to watch, the film has many flaws. Among these are (spoilers ahead):1) Jet Li's character is uninteresting. He is called ""Nameless"" and he has no past, no loves, no hates. There is almost nothing to explain him or his behavior in the film. Jet Li is a an actor with almost no emotional range but I thought he did well in this film, he just had almost nothing to work with.2) The army of the soon-to-be Emperor of China attacks a town by shooting arrows at it. This is really, really, silly. You use arrows to harass and kill enemy soldiers, you don't ""shell"" a town with arrows because it won't do any harm and arrows are expensive and time-consuming to make. You don't waste them by making pin-cushions of wooden buildings.3) We see Flying Snow stab and seriously wound her (former?) lover Broken Sword three times. Once as Jet Li tells it, once as the soon-to-be Emperor imagines it, and once again as Jet Li tells it (supposedly the truth this time). This is too many times. It didn't mean much the first time, it meant less the second time and the third time the director showed the event I couldn't have cared less. 4) The most interesting character turns out to be Broken Sword who actually has a change of heart as a result of fighting the future Emperor and chooses not to kill him when he had the chance. This pivotal event takes place in the past and we only learn of it near the end of the film. Broken Sword's change of heart is really the emotional heart of the film (since Tony Leung really CAN act). By the end of the film I wished the film was about Broken Sword, not Mr. Nameless. 5) Mr. Nameless's story turns out to be a tissue of lies, his skills are largely unknown, all his fights are ""fake"" and by the end of the film I had no interest in his fate. What a terrible choice it was to make Mr. Nameless the main character of the film.6) The first emperor was, by all accounts, a ruthless monster. It is no accident that the ruling power in China (nominally the Communist Party) supported this film. Just about the only tangible benefit they brought to China back in 1948 was unification. Millions dead, decades of economic failure but at least they united the country. In the film this human monster is presented as a misunderstood noble idealist. Dream on...",Hero
180,brandon_veracka,My All-Time Favorite Chinese Film,10,23 August 2018,"""Hero"" is a visually stunning film which tells a wonderful story. It is centered around three men-a swordsman, an emperor, and a calligrapher-who are incredibly passionate and driven. All of the main characters, including the supporting female roles, are easy to relate to. Although the story is slow-paced and projects an air of calm, it has this certain sense of urgency that will never leave you feeling bored. In this way it's unlike-and maybe even the polar opposite of-every kung fu movie I've ever seen.I was told Hero was the most expensive movie China had ever made (at that time), and in this case, the money went to good use. With its superb direction, cinematography, and soundtrack, this film will certainly stick out among the typically fast-paced, action-heavy films from China. One thing that will stand out about this film is its use of color, which many of its reviewers rightfully praised. Without spoiling anything, how color is used to tell this story is both visually beautiful and psychologically intriguing. Combined with its incredible soundtrack, it will very likely have artistically-inclined viewers agape and speechless. In the very least, ""Hero"" is a feast for the senses-like a fireworks show of color and sound. At its best, it is a wonderful story about nationalism, self-examination, and love which is told in an unusually beautiful fashion.As many will tell you, if you liked ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", you're likely to enjoy this just as much-especially if you liked the quieter, more introspective scenes in that film. Because there is so little to compare it to, ""Hero"" is a difficult film to review. However, that only gives you another reason to give it a chance. And finally, it must be said that this is Jet Li at his very best.",Hero

OK...the scenery is nice, but the plot is sort've detached, and the action unbelievable. Movies like Hero and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon will be collecting dust as forgotten an unmemoroble movies in a few years for the same reason as Greek myth movies. When's the last time you saw a movie with Zeus? When's the last time you bought a movie with Apollo?

182,auberus,"Stunning cinematography, technical 'tour de force', dubious historical accuracy make for a disappointing movie",6,9 July 2004,"Hero is a film that has to be seen, if only to make the inevitable Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon comparisons. Much-awaited wuxia, Hero is a visually-stunning mixture of art film, martial arts action, and dubious historical accuracy. Even though the oversimplified politics could raise the eyebrows of the initiated, the photography of the film only is a delight for the eye and a reason to see the movie. Looking at the film I understand better where the focus went. The scenario took 2 years of writing and yet the film fails at this level. Zhang Yimou wanted to redefine the definition of Hero and did that through an oversimplified political plot, the results from a story telling stand point is catastrophic as no emotions whatsoever arise from the characters. Their depiction is reduced to almost dull snapshots. Even the Rashomon-like storytelling does not work that well as technique can never replace substance. However the glorious cinematography of Christopher Doyle who uses specific color tones to highlight different versions of the events is a tremendous achievement. Red designates a more passionate accounting, while blue highlights a version colored by personal loss and sadness. Green, white and yellow come into play too, though to assign meanings and motifs to each and every color scheme. If anything, the different colors work as an effective narrative device that separates the various versions of the tale. In fact technique is what Hero is all about and in that matter, the film is a masterpiece. The costumes, production design, cinematography and martial arts choreography are all award-worthy. To note most martial arts fans will be delighted with the work of choreographers Ching Siu-Tung and Stephen Tung Wai. We've isolated the facts that Hero is a technical masterpiece with a catastrophic story telling dynamic but what about the message? First of all the fact that the story is based on history causes a few problems. The film posits that Ying Zheng's quest to conquer China is as much about protection as it is about tyranny, a version of events that not all historians may find agreeable. Is it proper to simplify the forces of history into a palm-sized package? More troubling are the modern political implications of the film's message. There is an obvious nod towards the importance of the greater good: ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one."" That's a fine message still, if one were to apply that thinking to modern times, some people (like the Taiwanese) might not be so swayed. I rarely saw cinematography that beautiful, however cinema is first about telling story, Zhang Yimou might have lost himself in the aesthetic realm of cinema...",Hero

Wonderful fight scenes.And yet the movie still sucked. Well, okay, it didn't suck, but it wasn't that good, either. It was... middle-of-the-road.

Otherwise you might want to stay away from it.THE STORY (poss. spoilers; I mean, not really 'cause you can see it coming anyway, but oh well) <----> Centering in flashbacks around a great warrior known as Nameless who comes to the Emperor of China, it tells the tale of Nameless and his exploits with three deadly assassins after the Emperor.

184,j30bell,Worthless Crouching Tiger Cash In,1,14 December 2004,"From the Hong Kong actors to the Tan Dun score this reeks of a Crouching Tiger cash in by director Zhang Yimou . Unfortunately, Hero is all style and painfully little substance. In fact, on the rare occasion when you get substance or ideas, they are usually so abhorrent you'd have rather they hadn't bothered.Briefly, the story centres around a nameless one - the man with no name - (Jet Li) an assassin. He has killed three enemies of the Qin Emperor who, in reward, has granted him an audience. As the two men talk, three versions of the Hero's story are told, exploring themes such as loyalty, honour and revenge. Each dominated by a prevailing colour. This all sounds very interesting. Problem is, it isn't. It's 96 minutes of exquisitely pushed out excrement. But let's concentrate on the good points for a minute.Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung are excellent. OK, may be that took less than a minute.So what's wrong with this film. Well firstly there is no character development, just a few good looking Chinese folk waving swords in a mildly diverting manner (think the opening ceremony of the forthcoming Beijing Olympics). Because of this you can't really give a monkey's about any of the characters, least of all Jet, who scowls his way through the movie without ever giving you the impression that there's anything more meaningful on his mind than the sweet sound of sword on flesh.Then there is the up-its-own-bottom-pseudo-artiness of it. There is an important point here. In Crouching Tiger, when Chow Yun-Fat and Zhang Ziyi dance on top of the bamboo forest, it is beautiful, not because the colours are rich, the imagery is splendid and movement is graceful. Li Mu Bai is a character you care for, showing a nobility of spirit we would like to aspire to. Ang Lee has already engaged you in his story, you want to believe he can do it. Cue Tony Leung's spot of calligraphy while Jet Li and Maggie Cheung ward off a cloud of arrows. Graceful? Yes. Colourful? Yes. Foetid brace of severed cojones? Unfortunately so.I mean there are so many reasons to dislike this film I could go on all day. But, since the main function of this review is to spare you the effort of seeing this worthless piece of tripe, let's finish on the one idea this film pushes out in its hour-and-a-half passage through the lower colon of Chinese cinema. I'm going to give you a clue to the end of the film now, so if you're still planning to see it (poor sucker) look away now.Apparently the emperor is just a misunderstood guy. I mean, he's raped, pillaged and slaughtered his way across Asia for one reason: to unite China, to end war (presumably because anyone who didn't agree with him is dead). To this the nameless one replies 'oh yeah, I guess you're really a nice guy then', and makes to leave. Some reviewers have said that Yimou doesn't comment on this explanation or decision. If this is so why does the director choose to end his film with a cut to the Great Wall of China, with a nauseatingly jingoistic caption underneath saying 'Our Land'? So that's all right then. Hitler? Misunderstood Euro-federalist. Stalin? Cuddly people-hugger. Rape of Nanking? Chinese just didn't understand what was good for them. See what I mean by 'rather they hadn't bothered'.To compare this monstrosity to Crouching Tiger is like whizzing on a Picasso (to quote Mike Myers). Watch Springtime in a Small Town or Twilight Samurai. For goodness sake, watch anything but this. If W made a movie about early America, it would echo Hero. I can think of no greater criticism. 3/10 (if that).",Hero

However having just seen it for a second time (on this occasion on DVD) I felt impelled to write. This is probably the most beautiful, elegiac, balletic film of epic proportions that you are ever likely to see up to present date (i.e. 28/3/2006). There is nothing to criticise. The acting by Jet Li, Tony Leung, Donnie Yen and Maggie Cheung as the hero/assassins is faultless and gripping. The direction exquisite and deliberately mannered which fits the style of the story impeccably. The photography is simply unbelievable, as are the sets and the costumes. The sound track, whether the sound effects such as falling rain drops or the music itself (composed by Tan Dun and played by Itzak Perlman)is heart-stopping in its loveliness and appropriateness. The editing is flawless. The choreography spectacular. What else can I say other than the story itself is deeply thought-provoking and heart-rending.

186,DP-4,Brilliant,9,28 December 2004,"Before I give my review, let me offer one suggestion that will help you appreciate this film. DO NOT SEE IT JUST ONCE. Watch it twice and then pass judgment. The film is so visually and artistically captivating that the plot can be harder to grasp the first time around. The second time around you'll get a better appreciation for the film.I viewed this film with high expectations. People were comparing it with Crouching Tiger and I really enjoyed that film. Within the first 10 minutes you understand why the comparisons are made. The cinematography, editing, music and special effects are similar. The stories, however, are quite different, and I found the story to be better than the one in Crouching Tiger.The story is about an assassin who concocts a plan to kill a king who had been trying to conquer his home land in pre-unified China. His assassination plan requires him to get close enough to the king to strike him dead. The movie shows the assassin's plan through a series of flashbacks, and culminates with the assassin getting his chance to kill the king.The beauty of this film is the how the assassin becomes a ""Hero"". I won't spoil how he achieves this, but that is what made the film great for me. It made the film more than just a visual and musical masterpiece. It also made it more than just a Kung Fu picture. It actually added a decent plot to the film which made it worth while. Honestly, I was just expecting a good Kung Fu picture. Hero is actually a great overall movie which just happens to accent the film with some of the best Kung Fu action in recent years.Definitely the best movie that I have seen this year. I hope it wins big at the awards ceremonies. It was impressive.-- DP.",Hero

189,mrphantasm,Why Martial Arts? The Answer: Hero.,10,16 August 2005,"How many times we have heard our friends and relatives asking us about our fascination with action-movies or films with martial arts? We always expect a film that could teach them how artistic could be Action and Kicks and Punches.The Wuxia Genre is the perfect way to tell stories so deep, emotional and philosophical such as the stories told in Ying xiong (Hero), but in the past and due to the high amount of movies of Wuxia that deliver Hong Kong these aspects sometimes are deluded in stories that just deliver action and energy. This particular film could perfectly be the sole justification of the existence of cinema of martial arts. But is not the first and hopefully won't be the last time when Asian filmmakers teach us why the Adventure and the Action speak better about ourselves rather than other movies. There are many undiscovered Martial Arts Films that has similarities with Hero.Slightly based in reality Hero is more a fantasy, at this point we should be careful with any accusations of wrong perception of history. The subtext and the moral that surround the plot are mature, intelligent and personal. Zhang Yimou view of heroism is superb. It's not a slow movie, but Hero leaves space for dialogue that has the same transcendence that the fights have. Hero not only dares to stretch the boundaries of storytelling also has and incredible visual style (Chris Doyle's cinematography), and colors also help to understand the story better. The final touch is the music of Tan Dun, a whole narration itself, Tan Dun give us a memorable score. Jet Li is probably the best martial artist alive and a good actor (two things that hardly are bond), and a rich story such as this one needed a talent like Jet's. Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung, Donnie Yen, a cast that is a mixture of dramatic actors and martial artist, all of them teaching us how the physical and emotional acting are one thing. Sorry for the super-stardom that believe in the use of a body double in almost every scene.Enjoy it and watch it again, tell your friends about Hero.",Hero
190,ACitizenCalledKane,"Without question, one of the most beautiful films I have seen in years!",8,11 January 2005,"Director Yimou Zhang produced a minor masterpiece in 2002 when Hero first appeared. Two years later, after much success and the development of a cult following, the movie was re-released to be met with even greater success. Often looked at as a combination of Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon and Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Hero is actually more than the sum of its inspirations. Yes, it does tell its story in a manner that fans of Rashomon will immediately recognize, and the brilliantly choreographed martial arts sequences due owe quite a bit to Woo-ping Yuen's work in Lee's picture. Yet, with its gorgeous cinematography, brilliant story, and the emotional performances of Tony Leung Chiu Wai (Broken Sword), Maggie Cheung (Flying Snow), and Ziyi Zhang (Moon). Jet Li gives a quiet, but by no means less-powerful performance as the nameless prefect. Also of note are the performances of Daoming Chen (King of Qin) and Donnie Yen (Sky). But what would these great performances be without a moving story? Jet Li plays ""Nameless,"" a prefect of Qin, who has apparently slain the three most dangerous assassins in the land. His reward is to speak with the king, whom he has so loyally served. During their conversation, Nameless tells the story (seen through a series of flashbacks) of how he was able to defeat his lord's most-feared adversaries. I won't go any further into the plot, because I do not want to ruin anything. This film is worth the price of admission just to watch the martial arts scenes, as spectacularly choreographed by Siu-Tung Ching and Wei Tung. The splendid use of color in the film is another pleasure to behold. Cinematographer Christopher Doyle presents a lush painting in motion as Nameless and the king discuss the prefect's adventures.

The whole point of this finale is that the characters have all backed themselves into terrible corners, and st least one of them has to die to allow any opportunity for change for the others. Only in this way can history be allowed to be the record of human decision-making again; and all involved in the finale understand this, even the Emperor, who by then knows he has allowed his passion for order to create suffering for too many people to hope for history's forgiveness. Thus the Hero's funeral procession becomes a march into history itself, an admission that what at the time seems grand design will also fade into a past only poorly remembered. Politics is not history, it is whatever can be accomplished in the moment.The drama of this film works that in in subtle and remarkable ways, becoming a film about memory and achievement; and the visuals emphasize this beautifully. And there is the acting and direction - splendid throughout.A thoughtful, troubling, beautiful epic.",Hero
192,vicdragon19-1,its a hero of a film,9,18 April 2007,"After I saw crouching tiger hidden dragon, i knew that Hollywood was a load of rubbish nowadays. HEro takes not only action further but just the essence of human emotion that acton films usually lack(besides crouching tiger).The plot can be confusing sometimes, as the story folds around four warriors out to kill the king of Qin. Jet Li is excellent as a warrior with no name called Nameless, who is the one chosen to kill the king. THe story is told several times, in colours to highlight the new aspect shown to us. IT is also significant that the true scene in the finale is show in white, which in China symbolies death.Everything about this film is stunning. Even though the numerous techniques does feel like an excuse to show off the beauty of the film, you ignore that as you experience the feelings of these characters. Maggie Cheung looks stunning, and the scene with Ziyi Zhang in the woods is absolutely breathtaking. The music is beautiful (i put some of it on my ipod!) and the film captures what being a hero actually means. The only drawback is that it doesn't go at a straightforward pace, but the retelling of the stories only adds new dimensions to the story.JEt Li has made his best performance, and thank god, that this is not a dumb flick such as Enter the Dragon or something.

194,siit,Magnificent Cinematographyat its best... Storyline at its VERY worst.,3,8 June 2005,"Well I'll be definitely bucking the popular trend for this film. For me on the whole I was VERY disappointed. The storyline(s) is extremely disjointed and confusing. It had a nice overall message of integrity, but to be honest I was so frustrated with the disjointedness of the movie it over-rode any fondness I had for it. The simple concept of the movie was dragged on and on to the point it lost its cohesiveness.Yes there is one saving grace; the cinematography is so outstanding, I have to think very hard to find another movie to rival it. The location is magnificent and the use of colour is magic. However the use of the colour tended to exaggerate the obvious disjointedness of the story(s).Jet Li was terrible. He seemed to never put any real effort into his role. He was like a stone most of the time from his introduction to... well the end.The shifts of stories was so bad I wouldn't even rate it a 1.

195,3-D,Overrated.,5,21 February 2006,"Quentin Tarantino slaps his name onto this nifty Jet Li kung-fu flick to get it released in the United States. It's not necessarily a bad movie, but I don't see why he'd go through so much effort to get it released in our country's theaters.Hero is a good flick in many aspects, but lacking in some areas. It tells the tale of a young fighter who approaches some Asian warlord to let him know he had defeated three assassins who were after him. Hearing that plot outline doesn't really draw you in, does it? Not me, really.The storyline is the movie's biggest flaw. I can't go too in depth about it so as to avoid giving spoilers, but several events and 'twists' happen in the movie that tend to confuse more than shock the viewer. Most of the movie is shown through these flashbacks that Jet Li's character has as he explains to the high-powered warlord his stories.Because of this, it gets hard to distinguish what has actually happened and what hasn't. I mean, you can end up pretty much assuming and figuring it out on your own, but to be confused at all is a big no-no for movies, except for 'whodunnit' mysteries. But, even after you figure out what's actually going on, you still feel that the plot is pretty stupid. I thought to myself, ""Wow, that's pretty gay,"" in the theater after realizing what was happening on the screen.The visuals are excellent. Fantastic fight sequences and superb visual effects are great, and definitely make the movie experience more enjoyable.In a nutshell, great visuals barely save a lame storyline in this particular movie. It may be good enough to watch one time, but I wouldn't suggest paying for the DVD when it comes out. My advice; stick to the Sonny Chiba classics instead.",Hero

The cinematography, set dressing, costumes, props and sets were all simply ""off the charts"". The rain drops, the flowing drapery, the leaves blowing in the wind - all of it was simply enchanting.But... there just isn't much substance to the rest of it.Why must we completely suspend any sense of the rational in order to watch this? This is my same complaint with ""Crouching Tiger - Hidden Dragon"", must we abandon any comprehension of the basic laws of physics? People don't fly, or float suspended in midair or run across water - no matter how skilled they may be in the martial arts. I personally feel the films would benefit GREATLY by making the characters a little more real and subject to the laws of gravity and motion that everyone else has to live within. And then there's the actual story. Lots of somber moments of introspection and vapid bits of David Carrodine ""Kung Fu"" -esque philosophy. ""I have looked at the calligraphy and now comprehend the essence of the universe"" - Yeah, uh huh.Maybe it's the genre I don't care for. I dunno. I really love the overall look of the film, I'm just disappointed that so little is done with it.

198,choatelodge,I tried to like it.,2,13 December 2004,"But failed. Obviously someone reasoned that if 'Crouching Tiger...' made money, that they could do it again and cash in a second time. Still to this day the Chinese film industry seems incapable of creating a production with a plot more sophisticated than that found in any of the Bruce Lee productions. This one, in character with the ilk, is about as deep as a kittens saucer of milk.I honestly tried to be forgiving, to 'get into it' and to accept the cultural differences that may make it difficult for me to adopt the mindset needed for this to entertain me, and I succeeded for a while until the cumulative banality got the better of my efforts.Can someone please tell these people that watching two opponents whirl swords around and clang them off each other is only entertaining for a very short time, and that after ten minutes of clangity clang clang clangity clang spin clang clang spin clang spin clang, we have had about nine minutes too much? It isn't suspenseful or entertaining, it's boring. BORING! Then, I suppose to spice things up, the directors have the fighters able to flit around in the air at will like chickadees or strike a pose and shoot straight through the air in one firmly held posture, with sword held out front like the cowcatcher on a locomotive. I suppose that displaying these physically impossible antics is meant to make up for the lack of a story.(I just wonder why it is that Western audiences are so forgiving of Asian movies that are so insulting to the intelligence? Can you imagine an audiences' reaction if John Wayne or Clint Eastwood as 'Dirty Harry' were to strike a pose with his gun extended in front of him and fly screaming through the air on wires, parallel to the ground for 50 feet or more? The exits would be jammed faster than if someone yelled 'fire!'! Yet people call this 'beautiful' in an Asian film. Go figure.)I look at the ratings this movie has garnered, and wonder if there is some deep meaning and value here that I am just too rough hewn to appreciate, for so many to praise it and I to scorn? But alas, I am left to conclude that no, there appear to be great many people who praise this genre of tripe as great stuff, in order to appear themselves as artsy and cultured. The same kind of people who don't understand Italian, but go to an opera and listen to people howling an aria in Italian, and come out saying it was a wonderful and moving story!

Costumes, settings, characters/actors and CG work beautifully together to weave a wonderful story. But I do have two issues with this movie...And I feel I give nothing away by saying this... Is it just me or does Asian cinema have an almost unnatural fixation with pathos? If you've seen Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, you understand that for the 'drama' portion of that film there was a sad part to the ending of the movie. That happens again in this movie. [Is it so wrong if characters are actually happy in the end?] That said, ONE sad sub story almost lessens the OTHER sub story. But, that could be forgiven.The OTHER problem I had with this movie is, that after a wonderful act one, and a fantastic progression through act two, complete with twists and turns, the pace in act three drags to a crawl! After all the wonderfully choreographed fight scenes and the twists that the story takes at times, the resolution of this entire tale seems to drag on FOREVER!However, despite that, this movie is still worth seeing at least once.

The film is beautifully filmed and steeped in Chinese history. The visual feast at times is stupendous and the set pieces are meticulously put together. The acting is top rate, the plot intriguing and the films sad yet triumphant end caps off a fine and engaging piece of cinema.So why not a ten? This film, like Crouching Tiger (over-rated bore fest) and House of Flying Daggers (will that women ever die at the end?) is just too stylised for me. As soon as I see Jet Li and his compatriots flying through the air and skipping off lakes I start to switch off. Whilst these films are fantasy offerings, and whilst the action sequences are well filmed, they are of course ridiculous. And that is its biggest flaw.Frankly the film, along with the others, just doesn't need these ridiculous artistic fantasy pieces to work. Hero plays out incredibly well on its own merits, with Li, dominating the film throughout. The fight scenes, rich cinematic content and evocative storyline is more than enough. The fantasy elements are almost comic book in comparison.Hero could quite easily have been a masterpiece if the director had backed away from the fantasy and put this film out as a historical epic.Not zero, but Hero?

Well-acted with graceful fight choreography mostly centered around swords. Colours were used purposefully. Dialogues were written to move the plot and bring about a sense of understanding and emotion, performed convincingly. Every word spoken has a strong sense of meaning and purpose.One gripe I might have about this which might or might not be of any importance to you is that although I watched the Director's Cut with a runtime of about 100 minutes, it certainly felt longer than that. Felt like an epic of more than 2 hours with its sprawling landscapes and liberal use of slow motion shots.All in all, a well-executed film in almost all aspects. Would recommend.",Hero

It wasn't that I found the plot confusing, though at times it was hard tell which was true and which was not, that was just the way it was intended. I didn't feel anything for the nameless hero he was cold and dry, we saw nothing of his background which maybe was intended, but we also saw nothing of why the assassins would want to kill the King of Qin, there was no images of war or terror, in fact he was the most likable character of the lot. I cared nothing for any of the assassins because I just didn't know them. I didn't see any character development. Nevertheless the action was pretty cool, and the acting was excellent, the king of Qin was powerful yet personal, and the two women played really strong performances.I can see how some people have said this movie was overly sympathetic to the communist cause, particularly towards the end of the movie, but it is just a different perspective to the unification of China which often isn't emphasized. Peace and unity, unfortunately often comes through war. And while there has been endless comparison to Crouching Tiger, I was thinking more of The Emperor and the Assassin, which showed in much more detail one assassins quest to kill the King of Qin. If you have seen it, you will know what I mean when I say that Hero is lacking in depth and detail.",Hero
203,Frogfisher,Was surprised to find that I liked it.,10,23 May 2003,"I've never seen a Asian movie all the way through before. I actually went to see the incredible visual scenes and the fighting. Had no idea that I would like it as much as I did. It's an incredible visual epic story. And it's nothing like anything out of the US. The story line is not as straight forward as many other films, it takes time to tell the real story. It's a typical fight movie with more deepth and strength in the love scenes than many others of it's type.The Story goes from something like we've seen hundreds of times before. But then it turns out to have alot of twists and turns. Perhaps the story isn't the most original or best written. But what the film lacks in story, it gains in stunning Effects, action, grand visual scenes and the well made distinctive change from storyline to storyline.I loved it and plan to see it again.Like other before me Ill go to the comparison between ""Crouching..."" and ""Hero"". First of all the comparison isn't that easy, it's two very different stories. ""Crouching..."" is a more personal and less colorfull story about being true to yourself. ""Hero"" is a small part of the long history of China, it's more a stunning colorfull film about the choices Heroes make to become Heroes. My Favourite is ""Hero"", probbaly because I saw that one first. I've always liked colorfull esthetic settings, and the Fights in their minds are mindblowing. ""Crouching..."" is a slower film it takes more time, and even if some of the fight and emotionel scenes are better made, ""Hero"" is my Favourite.",Hero
204,angie2911,"Atmospheric, visually stunning cinematography",9,3 October 2004,"If like me, you didn't particularly enjoy ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", you should give this movie a chance.It more than pleasantly surprised me, with a story of love, courage and sacrifice.There is also an early twist. Well, more like seeing a story from a different view-point, more of which are shown later on.The colours are simply stunning, as are the settings, scenery, direction, sound, and editing.A use of slow-motion techniques shows raindrops falling, close encounters with weapons, or ballet-like swordfights.Colour is used to convey emotion or a point of view across an entire scene, from silks to costumes, to the colour of leaves on a tree.A delight for the senses, and leaving you wishing more ""World"" cinema made it's way into movie theaters to displace films produced on the Hollywood production line.",Hero
205,c-corleis,The Usual Suspects entering The Matrix in China,7,27 February 2006,"The fans of this movie may tar and feather me for my opinion: But i am not a fan of all the exaggerated fighting-scenes. Of course, they are well made and really beautiful (i.e. the impressionistic ""Duel in the yellow forest"" remembers me to the gorgeous autumn-leafs-scene in ""Bambi"" ;-), but they are disturbing the story of the movie for me: The fighters ""dancing"" on the roofs, running over the water, flying trough the air... It looks like ""Matrix in China"" for me, but in ""Matrix"" all the fighting scenes are in a logical context, because the complete world in which they fight was only a simulation. But the story of ""Hero"" played in the real world. And i think, that even the best swordsman can't simply ignore the gravity laws. Maybe this is the way such stories was told in China; more like the traditional Chinese theater?On the other side: The story, the core of the movie, was very good: The story was told trough different eyes in different versions, and if you think, you got it and know the truth now, another version of the same incident comes up and all is open again. It was sophisticated and twisted like ""The usual Suspects"". The ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"" are not separated. Every new point of view give you new hints... and sometimes the wrong hints.IMHO this movie would work better with less ""Matrix-like"" special effects and with a closer view on the captivating and twisted story.

208,niceguy68,Excellent Kung-fu and special effects,9,10 August 2004,"The story is pretty well covered in other reviews so I'll skip it.I'll just comment on this: It has very nice fight scenes, IMHO better than Crouching Tiger. The story line is quite different and the treatment is quite different from Crouching tiger. This is not a sequel nor a rip-off, just like Crouching tiger was not a rip-off of Chinese Ghost Story 1. However the style is inspired, and I think it's just the new Hong Kong style.Hero has very good army scenes, and the archery attacks are pretty awesome, reminiscent of the CGI work done in Lord of the Ring.The only unsettling thing for action fans is that the movie is multiple, though very different, renderings of the same events, narrated by different people until the truth is reached.Cinematography is very good, a little similar to Peter Pan 2003 where the colors palette is retouched depending on the emotion.Enjoy!..

209,gingerrdriley,"The fact that spaghetti westerns rarely, if ever, feature spaghetti should tell you something about dishonesty in film making.",7,30 June 2017,"It's really good, but you should try not to view it with the expectation of conventional film making, despite the time tested method of storytelling. Watching this film for the second time recently, someone I was with remarked that this film resembles a sort of Greek tragedy. I think that's actually a really good way to contextualize this film. The way this film is written and presented is more evocative of ancient methods of storytelling which precede traditional film. I'm not really referring to the way the way the characters speak to each other necessarily, nor the predictability of the narrative (though in fairness, the narrative isn't super hard to follow or even predict). The methods I'm referring to run more along the lines of storytelling by the characters, exaggerated supernatural ability of the characters, and the clear sense of morality and ideology by both the characters and, it seems, Yimou Zhang. The writing of this film reminds me more of Homer's Odyssey than a kung fu movie. Speaking of Homer, the characters in this film are presented in the action scenes as being superhuman in skill and ability. This is done, of course, via beautifully choreographed wire fu. These scenes are plentiful in the film and greatly accentuate the poetic nature of the story. I should clarify though, for the most part the action in this film is meant to express emotions that have very little to do with tension. They're not typical movie fights. The point is not to wonder what will happen or who will win, but rather to understand the emotions and motivations of the characters through a sort of elaborate dance. If you understand the nature of the story and how the action compliments it, then you will see its true value. The common complaint I hear concerning this film is that its somewhat shallow. I would actually agree with that, in a way. This film doesn't really ask any difficult questions, and I can't imagine any intelligent audience would find it especially challenging on an emotional level. While I do admire the relatively unique method of story telling, so far as the context of the film medium is concerned, I can't say it lends itself too well to the type of moral quandaries or meditations which are characteristic of great films. It's akin to a children's film. The observations and themes it presents are things which are just common knowledge for anyone older than 12. That's not to say it's bad. This is a very good film. Bear in mind though, that your emotional resonance with it might not amount to much. It's a visual feast, and a love letter to historical storytelling. Check it out, but don't come with too many expectations of a conventional film.",Hero
210,damien-16,pretentious beauty,6,27 October 2003,"I think Zhang Yimou is at all times an excellent cinematographer and often a very good director, but the director stayed at home when making Hero.  Oh, the images are stunning, but also totally artificial.  They serve no other purpose than to illustrate how brilliantly he can use colour and composition.  There is no content. Everything in this film has been done before: the subject (The emperor and the assassin, by Chen Kaige), the plot (starting with Rashomon, evidently), the use of colours (un homme et une femme, for instance), music as counterpoint to a duel (Sergio Leone, most notably in Once upon a time in the West) and of course the idea to make a Chinese Martial Arts film accessible to western audiences (move over, CTHD, or at least, that was the idea).  Whereas CTHD had likeable characters whom you could relate to, an interesting plot, emotional development, a very charming performance by Zhang Zi Yi and on top of that beautiful landscapes superbly photographed and rousing fights (especially the one between Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Zi Yi in the courtyard), Hero only has the stunning images.  It's like a coffeetable book.  Two-dimensional.  Zhang Yimou gets out his whole box of tricks, but that's what we see, tricks.  We don't get emotionally involved.  Always you can see the artifice behind it all, and this idea of: look at me, see what a genius I am.  Beauty that's that pretentious leaves a bad aftertaste.",Hero

I also appreciate the deep sense of tragedy he captures in all his stories as well as their deep poetic impact on the scene he is painting.As for martial arts movies and realism, if you'd rather watch two guys sloppily wrestle each other for 2 hours be my guest.  Superman can burn you with his eyes and keanu can manipulate the matrix so sit back relax and enjoy some Chinese supermen flying around and shut the heck up. You still can't look as good as Jet Li and Donnie Yen even with special effects so quit hating. Anyway I saw vintage Zhang Yimou with Yuen Woo Ping style wuxia and I got my kung fu fix and then some.  Next John Woo should step up to bat and add his vicious camera skills to the level achieved so far.  Imagine Face Off with Jet Li vs Donnie Yen.  Throw in Chow yun Fat and Tony Leung for the gunplay and that would make my vision of movie bliss a reality.",Hero
212,death-hawk1,Can Chinese people fly?,2,10 March 2013,"I was forced to watch this tripe for a film study paper at university. If you want to watch an ""art"" film and pay attention to elements of mise-en-scene then 2 stars might be an unfair rating. However if you want to watch a film with a story or perchance acting then 2 stars could even be generous. I opted for the averageBefore the screening started the lecturer made sure we realised that the director had used as little CGI as possible. Every person seen in the film is a real person, on deployment from the Chinese Army. The glass still lakes are actually glass still and not CGIed, to the extent where a 4 minute scene on one took over 15 days to film as there was only 30minutes to 2hrs of glass stillness per day to film on. Another example is the scene in the forest with yellow leaves. The director used 100s of workers (probably from a local sweatshop) to collect and sort the leaves into different grades of yellow so that it looked perfect for this scene. Lots of Kudos for the director so far.After all this lack of CGI you'd expect a film to the standard of Ghandi. Unfortunately in every fight scene the combatants were able to leap to extraordinary heights and if they ever came close to the ground they only needed a menial action such as a glancing high five to the still glass lake before reascending. Another example is the 5000 real soldiers firing 50 million CGIed arrows at Jet Li and some other woman who then block said millions of arrows with fancy sword work.Thus all the Kudos gained by the director for not using CGI he lost for using CGI. Then he lost more through his film having no element of a plot. And terrible acting throughout. And considering all this it went on too long. Maybe if it was concentrated into a 30minute episode of anime it could appeal to Japanese youth but unfortunately in its current form it is nothing more than cinematic bilge.",Hero
213,daisuke69,visually stunning piece of art,7,19 January 2005,"This movie, contrary to many Hollywood movies, focuses as much on the visual style as it does on the story behind the beauty, perhaps even too much so.I was completely impressed and blown away by the changes of color, the amazing backdrops (unlike some current Hollywood movies where everything is left to CGI) and the sets used, the acting of everyone involved is excellent and the action sequences are very well played out with a lot of detail given to minor things in those scenes even when they're likely to pass unseen.It's irresistible to compare this movie to crouching tiger, hidden dragon, but the fact is that they're pretty much in different genres, crouching tiger is a pure action fantasy that follows a linear plot. Hero resides more in the realm of artistic and independent films, using a less conventional or linear script mixed in with visual cues and metaphors. While I do love the movie and would give it a 7.5 or 8 out of 10, the plot itself plays against it as much as it helps it, I found myself falling asleep while I lay in bed watching it, probably because the movie revisits the same place and story over and over again with different twists to change the tempo. I believe that the plot would have made a better book than it did a film, but then again, and I can't seem to stop mentioning it, the use of such stunning color contrasts and backdrops would be lost to a reader. For the record, I have fallen asleep to other great but slow moving films in the past.This movie is a must watch, just don't rent or buy it expecting an action movie because that's not what it's about.",Hero

After all, this movie is a 6/10The acting in the movie is alright, I understand that they are acting the customs of how their characters were at the time (generation) of the Qing dynasty, but it leaves the acting dead and bland. Fight scenes were magnificent, but, differing from ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" Hero feels choreographed. Well besides the first fight in the rain, the rest feels like a choreographed dance. I loved it, as I tend to love these type of fight movies, but it just felt choreographed. Not silly, just you could tell that the movements were planned.The camera angle, not involving Jet Li or the Qin Emperor, but of the others, were really cheesy.

I understand that this is a telling of how China came to be by ""uniting"" the different kingdoms but it, possibly inadvertently, sends the message that war and conquer are good. The king is a ruthless man who will do anything to achieve his goals of bringing the different kingdoms together. This includes the killing of many individuals. Sometimes war is necessary. To protect. But never to conquer. We should all be united, but not in the way this film presents. We can live separately yet together in peace. The different kingdoms could have thrived separately but this king was willing to kill so that they would all be forced under one rule. Not because the others were dealing with injustice or the like but because that's just how he wanted it. So while the film is obviously stunning visually - the choreography, the use of color, lighting, etc. it all ultimately fails in its portrayal as the message is not one that deserves to be uplifted. It's a great film for its endeavors but ultimately shameful in what it's trying to tell us. Allowing the king to succeed may have stopped the killing but he started it to begin with and this choice undoes the entire sacrifice of nameless and the two lovers and their pain.",Hero

The comparison is inevitable, there simply is no other frame of reference.That being said, there's no denying the power of the drama that the plot of ""Hero"" presented.  The pageantry, the scope and the depth of the characters justify the many foreign film awards it has won.  Add to that the fact that this is the most expensive movie ever produced in China, and you have a textbook definition of the work ""epic"".I would like to think that I am capable of seeing the forest for the trees when it comes to movies like this - which is to say, lift my preferences out of the slam-bang action flicks or lowbrow comedies that are the usual fare for summer audiences.  But the truth is, by the time ""Hero"" went into its last half hour, I was bored.  Watching the same scenes play out from different perspectives got tiresome.  (But I will say that having the characters' outfits change color depending on the mood of the moment was a nice cinematic touch.)  The story line became a kind of Kurosawa-meets-Shakespeare plot of betrayal and assassination, and by the time the movie ended, I found myself not even caring which side won or who lived and died.Take my review for what it's worth - that of a average Joe who tried for two hours to raise his intellectual bar to a level where he could see where all the critics' four- and five-star ratings were coming from, but was ultimately unable to do it.

Because I live in San Diegoand not China, I had resigned myself to having to wait til Novemberto see it(the release date has been pushed to May as of the time ofthis review).  Fortunately for me, Hero premiered at the PalmSprings film festival, a scant 2.5 hours from here.  So me, myroommate, and some friends in L.A. all jumped in our cars anddrove out, betting that the film would be worth the drive.  We allagreed: TOTALLY WORTH IT!!!  This film completely met myexpectations and then some.  The plot centers on the legend of theassassins who were sent to kill the King of Qin, more than 2,000years ago.  Jet Li plays Nameless, a small territory prefect who isallowed to sit and drink with the Emperor for killing the threelegendary assassins, Broken Sword(Tony Leung-Chiu Wei), FlyingSnow(Maggie Cheung), and Sky(Donnie Yen).  The film is told inflashbacks as Nameless recounts how he did it.  The longawaited rematch between Jet Li and Donnie Yen takes place at thebeginning of the film, and while not quite as jaw dropping as theirdueling in ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA 2, it was a thing ofbeauty.  The choreography by Ching Siu Tung(who seems to do allthe wuxia films) and Wei Tung is excellent.  Christopher Doyle'scinematography is breathtaking throughout the film, and thiscombined with Emi Wada(Kurosawa's RAN)'s costumes play animportant part in the different versions of the stories that are told. Each version has a different color design, and each color has aspecific meaning, but I'm not going to tell you what.  Go see it andfind out.  Tan Dun's score, while very similar to his work onCrouching Tiger, is also perfectly used here, which is really all thatmatters.  All in all, the film is just amazing.

The thread that we are parts of the whole, and at the same time we are the whole itself, is pervading Hero on every scale - from the allusions on the fundamental link between martial art, calligraphy, music, go...; through the marvellous half-word dialogue between King and Nameless; to the final scene of insight, and then sacrifice.

And ""Hero"", the Academy Award nominated film is no exception. I have been lucky enough to buy a dvd copy of this film and I think it's the best film of 2003! And I'm almost certain as the year continues I will not see a movie that could beat it. As I read people's comments on here, it seem many feel ""Hero"" is similar to Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". But, I feel people who say that, are not familiar with Chen Kaige's ""The Emperor & the Assassin"". It's these two films that draw a comparison. Both films take place in the same time period. And both films deal with the same subject. ""Hero"" is the story of a man  named ""nameless"" (Jet Li). He has assassinated three of the most feared assassins who have made attempts on the King's life. For this impressive feat, he gets to meet the king. And it is there he explains to the king how exactly he was able to do it. But, about halfway through the film, something happens. And it sets the movie in a whole new direction. And this is where I became hooked. And ""Hero"" turns itself into a compassionate, tender, and absorbing film. There are so many heartfelt moments. So many moment where we glad give our emotions to the characters. We almost feel what they are feeling. This is what makes ""Hero"" a great film. As I first watched the movie I started thinking this film doesn't seem to have the grandeur of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""The Emperor & the Assassin"". The fight scenes were not as amazing as those in ""Crouching Tiger...ect"" either. But, I've never known Yimou to make a film like this. Then again, I was surprised by last year's ""Happy Times"". I never thought I'd see him a make a comedy. But, trust me as ""Hero"" goes on, you'll find the movie to be just as involving in the end. The movie's ultimate message, without spoiling the film for you, is about peace. I'll leave it up to you to catch the connection in today's modern world.

Visually, it is a stunning film.However, this is a pretty film with a deeply suspicious message at its center. The Emperor, who conducts offensive wars of genocide against neighbor kingdoms in the name of unity, and rules his own populace with cruelty and an iron hand in the name of order, has all of his actions rationalized and even glorified. The Emperor is also an unapologetic nationalist. In other words: having the streets run red with the blood of innocents is perfectly acceptable, even noble, as long as it is done in the name of unity and order.It is probably no coincidence that a highly authoritarian government noted for brutal crackdowns on dissent and offensive wars against neighbor states in the name of ""unity"" (like Tibet) financed a film that glorifies its most egregious behavior.

Magnificent and giant artwork is enough to keep you with the movie and increase your interest in Chinese history. Lavish yet clean living style of the people and the costumes, not to mention the colours and the way the events are narrated. However, movie is more about the complex love story between two assassins then another one with extreme speed. Essential Chinese arts of Qin, Wéiqí ,Calligraphy and Painting are amazingly blended with the themes while first 3 are expressive shown, Painting is rather subjective to the audience perception of colour work through out the movie.

Now you think I'm going to talk about the flashbacks, the color scheme or something like that. No. I'm talking about the trailers. This is currently the #1 movie in the box office, but I think most people out there rushing to see it based on the posters and the trailers will be seriously disappointed. The movie is not about a romantic or heroic plot. It's a deconstruction of that kind of plot.First of all, this has to be one of the most visually ambitious films I've ever seen. There is a scene where the largest number of archers you've ever seen together in the same frame throw arrows to a calligraphy house, and the master of the house orders his pupils to patiently accept death while writing in the sand. Writing and fighting are not different. And writing will survive the fighting.Now that we've got the drooling about the visuals out of the way, let's talk about the plot. Yes, it follows a ""Rashomon"" approach to storytelling. That means different characters retell the same plot and the stories are shown on screen as accepted fact. But the intentions are very different from the ones in the Kurosawa classic. ""Hero"" isn't so much a storytelling experiment as an attempt to discern the nature of the so-called hero and the rules of honor that guided the historical battles in China.In that regard, I think this movie has much more to say than I was able to catch on during my first viewing. Jet Li, who plays the hero, has to face a decision in the end, and the man he fights for the entire duration of the movie (only with words instead of swords) has to face yet another one. At the end, who was the winner? Who was the hero? What did the death that occurs at the very end of the movie mean?Many people are saying that the movie is a visual landmark but that it's emotionally detached (unfair comparisons to ""Crouching tiger, hidden dragon"" abound) and pretty shallow. I think this opinion is wrong and that it's caused by the unusual approach to storytelling the movie takes and also by the expectations caused by the misleading advertising. This isn't a movie where we have to root for one or another character. We are watching one very big scope of things and we're being asked to think. Think real hard.And that's one of the things I love the most about movies. When one viewing isn't enough to figure it all out. When you can talk for hours about the way you see it and the way a friend sees it and the way the video store nerd sees it. But it isn't quite enough.",Hero
230,thebeautifulones,A deeper meaning,8,27 December 2005,"I have to give it an 8, because while the fight scenes are good, I felt they could be a bit better.That saying, the show is more about the story behind the 3 characters than the fight scenes. Which is what a sword-fighting show should be about (see the show for the 3 principles of swordsmanship and you will understand).The true hero in the show isn't the one who went to try and assassinate the King of Qin, it is someone else.The subtitles are bad in the DVD. The true meaning of a lot of the words exchanged between the characters are spoiled when translated. I feel there could be a better way to translate the words. That saying, watch this and compare it with the Lee Ang film, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, where the spoken Mandarin is not reflective of the times. People who spoke Mandarin during those times, spoke it in a very formal way, like in Hero, while in the latter film, it was very informal, closer to the modern way of speaking.While the King of Qin is portrayed as kinder than he said to be, remember this, we will never know the truth about the King, but essentially, unification at that point in time was important.At the last scene, there are some words in Mandarin which the translation is not available. For the non-Mandarin speaking fans, if you want it, write to me!",Hero
231,eric1,A tribute to Chinese Dictators,1,30 August 2004,"As a Chinese, I can not believe the movie got a rate this high in U.S. And I don't think you guys get it. It's not fantasy, the Emperor in it is the first guy to conquer the whole land of China, to do that, his army left a lot of bloodshed. A couple of times,they buried hundreds of thousands people alive.That's why there are so many killers aiming him, they want revenge. But in the movie, this chinese Hitler became the good guy, his side is the good, the killers are all wrong. So according to me and a lot of chinese moviegoers, Hero is a tribute to the chinese dictators behind the Tian-An-Men massacre.Its main idea is that it's everyone's duty to sacrifice himself for the emperor a.k.a the dictator. If you guys love the combat, give it 6 or 7, but don't give it a 10.",Hero

233,mynystry,if you can put the politcs aside... this film is stunning,7,31 May 2006,"I have been thinking about it and now I edit my previous review and lower the score of this film from 8 to 7. I understand those who attack this film because of the political meaning... but it is just impossible to deny that as an artistic expression it is stunning. Sometimes it is hard to judge if something is beautiful or not because of the political background.The fact is, the amazing work of photography and detail of the film is just too amazing, the music helps this film making it even more memorable, and the acting and the special effects are also great. I agree that there is a nationalistic message in this movie, but even I detest nationalism and I adored this film... why? because I didn't focused on that, but in the beauty of the film itself, on the colors, the sounds, the flowing and the time. The emperor isn't the main character in this film. I feel the main characters are broken sword, the nameless warrior and Flying Snow... they are the ones that carry the meaning of the film, and not the empire idea... tho it would have been even better if nameless had kill that tyrant... well, enjoy the film.It is always easy to question the politics because they are (maybe by definition) dirty and egoistic... but we cannot question that the pyramids of Egypt, the Great Wall, Chichen Itza, the Gothic cathedrals, The Taj Majal, etc. even if built under very questionable political control, are great states of art. But come on, I am not comparing this film with them of course, I just want you to understand that the politics should be put on the back. I think this film is beautifully made, and that it contains valuable messages, you just have to separate what it really matters from what does not.",Hero
234,cossallpsycho,Made For Cinema,9,20 March 2005,"This film is undeniably beautiful. I enjoyed it immensity but it is undoubtedly made for cinema. The cinematography, set and costume design and the direction are superb and I can imagine that on a nice 50 foot screen it would be a magical experience to say the least. Unfortunately, for me at least, I only got to see it on a rather disappointing 14"" screen. I say unfortunately because it takes away everything that is brilliant about this film and leaves only the rather thin plot. The plot is interesting but is basically the same story told by different people which, without the overwhelming beauty of the pictures can get rather tedious. This is still film making of the highest quality but really needs to be seen on a decent sized screen. A 14"" screen is just not worth it.",Hero
235,shammuk,Hero a different kind of Wu Xia,10,26 January 2003,"Everyone that is familiar with Zang Yi Mou's work will know that he is not a communist idealist. All of his previous films have been about criticizing the chinese government and the communist idealism. Everyone knows that the emporer of the chin dynasty was a important figure in chinese history. I don't agree to everything that he did, but atleast he unified china and gave the people a short period of peace time until his death. Otherwise who knows how many more lives will be lost and how many more wars there will be. China was fighting a civil war during that time and the other warring states was killing one another also. It's not like the Chin emperor was the only one that was doing the killing. The united states also went through war to become what they are today. First killing off the indians then killing each other in the civil war. Now there is democracy through all this blood that was spilled. I dont think its fair to say that this film is a communist film.Zang yi mou was definitely trying something new in this film. It's more of an art film than a commercial film. So if you go in the theater and expect something like the matrix or crouching tiger u will be disappointed. One thing that I was amazed was the set design and the colors that was used in this film. Zang yi mou used to be a cinematographer before he became a director, so this is something he is good at. The fighting on the lake really amazed me. I wonder how they set up those wires for the actors to fly on the lakes. I have to say the fight scenes in this film is nothing like I've ever seen in Hong Kong martial arts film. It is not as difficult as some other films but the artistic quality ot it is just incredible. How every little detail was shown.",Hero
236,FlaviusAetius,"A flowing work of art, one of the supreme masterpieces of cinema",10,18 November 2006,"If the opening line is any indication, I loved this movie. In an age when Hollywood is taking what's profitable over what's good and is increasingly pumping their movies full of stale clichés, Zhang Yimou's Hero comes sailing over from China like much-needed reinforcements to the forces of good movies.A man without a name, called Nameless(that makes sense) is on his way to meet with the Emperor of Qin for killing the three deadliest assassins in China. Thus begins a time-twisting battle of the minds between the two as they both share their interpretations of the events. Each interpretation has its own color scheme, too! Nameless' initial flashback is red, followed by blue. The emperor's is green. And the truth is white.This movie is nothing short of epic. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers marching on a small Zhao town before inundating it in a literal storm of arrows. Dazzling special effects that create all manners of impossible images that will stick with you for weeks after you see them. Insanely complex and beautiful fight scenes between martial arts masters which enrapture the imagination and make your jaw hang down. And the 'fight on the water' scene, which is easily one of the five coolest things I have ever seen. The soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful: one of the main themes is a remix of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon music, but Tan Dun composes some new music as well, and it's just as thought-evoking. There's little dialogue, but what is said typically means a lot. All in all, the movie moves with a grace and an inspired soul much like the greatest works of poetry.The film's story, and its ending, however, are what transforms it into a merely great film into a true masterpiece. Nameless is torn between Flying Snow and Broken Sword: Snow, fiercely nationalistic to her homeland of Zhao, wants the Qin emperor killed. Sword, however, realizes that the emperor might stand a chance of unifying China. If he killed the emperor, it simply would have been a continuation of the war between the states. If he let the emperor live, it would be an act of good on a level greater than Zhao or Qin. In the end, he decides to let the emperor live, praying that he remembers the ideal of a warrior.Not everyone will endear to what basically boils down to the closest thing there is to pro-war message in movies lately. Some people think that war is an evil in all situations bar none. But the them of the movie is sacrifice for a greater good.To give you a historical background, Hero takes place during the Warring States period, which went from the 5th century BC to 221 BC. During this period, China was in a state of constant warfare between a handful of competing states all vying for power. Its precursor was the Spring and Autumn period, the Chinese dark ages in which power was decentralized and up to 170 different states grappled for supremacy. This was not the idealized disorder that anarchists promise you where everyone is communal in their possessions and actions: this was utter chaos. Millions of lives were snuffed out by centuries of incessant war and cities were razed. By killing the emperor and preventing Qin from taking control of China, who knows how long the Warring States period would have continued? The events of Hero are fictional, but the point remains: war can solve things, for right or for wrong. When faced with such challenges on the scale of millions of people, you have to realize that some people will die no matter what you do.Hero is the best movie of 2002 when it was made and 2004 when it came out in the US. I hope Zhang Yimou keeps it up. I'm getting sick of all the prosaic potboilers infesting the Hollywood market.",Hero

You might actually have to watch it twice to fully appreciate it.Spoilers ahead! The movie was truly amazing, but I hate the ending. No, the death is not the part that I hate. What I hate is the simultaneous chanting of about 1000 soldiers. It is just silly! I understand the reason it was done, but it just felt totally out of place to me.

From the music to the love story to the visual elements and fighting styles, it has the same feeling, mood, and characters that CTHD did (but without the heart anddevelopment).

241,keith-283,Stunningly beautiful film hides weaknesses,7,7 November 2004,"Sumptuous is the word that springs to mind when watching this particular film, and it is truly stunningly beautiful to look at. The choreographed fight scenes between the Nameless Hero and the various would be assassins are spectacular, the stunning military scenes with the casts of thousands, the arrival at court etc leave you gasping for breath (the particular fight scene between Nameless and Sky in a very rainy and wet tavern is particularly stunning, even though virtually everything is various shades of grey!).It does, however, lose itself. Told in a series of flashbacks, there is little in way of character development. There are few opportunities to identify with any of the characters (with maybe the exception of Moon, Broken Sword's young servant) - consequently there is little in the way of emotional involvement. Final result is one of merely 'watching' rather than being drawn in. There are too many one on one fight scenes, particularly early on, and, wonderous though they are, I found myself thinking 'not another one' as Hero faced Snow yet again in combat.I may have been overgenerous with a 7 marking as I did leave disatisfied, but on reflection, it was spectacular to watch on a giant screen.",Hero
242,jiujitsu_jesus,Ludicrous,4,16 December 2004,"There is one word that flawlessly summarises every facet of this film: LUDICROUS. Ludicrous cost; ludicrous length (at least, it felt that way); ludicrous storyline; ludicrous physics; and combat scenes so unbelievably ludicrous, they were, in many cases, humorous.Physically impossible combat is, of course, a trademark of far-eastern art cinema, and there have been many truly brilliant films based on this (CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON for instance). HERO, however, is far off the mark of success that movies such as this strive to hit. It is not the sheer surreality of the film that is its downfall - it is the fact that there is no artistic content to justify it. The dialogue and drama that would have saved this movie are extremely sparse, meaning that much of the film's playing time is devoted to the aforementioned inane fighting scenes. And no, the plot cannot save this movie - while it attempts to be, at the most fundamental level, deep and moving, it is so poorly explored and justified that it sadly comes across as idiotic.Still, all these faults might have been forgivable if HERO had been marketed to the public in the appropriate fashion. All the commercial advertising, however, seemed to be hyping it up as the latest, action-packed martial arts blockbuster, rather than the cultural art film it truly is (the fact that Quentin Tarantino had his name on it didn't help). The concept may have proved brilliant - but the presentation let this film down like a missile bringing down a dirigible.Are you passionately into far-eastern cinema? You may love this film. Do you love protracted combat scenes? You might like this film. Failing that, do you have a hell of a lot of patience? You might be able to stand this film.

It is set during the reign of Shi Huangdi, the first emperor of China, who founded the Qin dynasty. The Emperor (Doaming Chen) built the Great Wall and unified his empire, yet he still has won lots of would-be assassins, the deadliest of which include Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung), Broken Sword (Tony Leung), and Sky (Donnie Yen). The king cannot get any sleep at night because of those assassins. Then, one day, a nameless warrior (martial arts legend Jet Li) comes to the King and presents to him the weapons of those three deadly assassins, claiming that he killed them all and seeks a reward.The King is baffled on how the nameless hero is able to defeat those three deadly assassins, and he asks him to tell how exactly did he achieve this feat. And thus begins ""Hero,"" told in flashbacks, showing the nameless hero's defeat of Broken Sword, Flying Snow, and Sky, all of which are told from the nameless hero's point of view. (spoilers ahead!) But is the nameless hero indeed telling the truth? Or it could be he is, in fact, an assassin himself! ""Hero"" is an interesting film, complete with an interesting script and complex, well-told story that's full of surprises. Like the King of Qin, the viewer, too, makes guesses on whether the nameless hero did, indeed, kill the assassins as he claimed or he is simply one of them. The viewer is made to speculate, and there are many guesses. The story makes the viewer think and make decisions.""Hero,"" like ""Crouching Tiger,"" is part of the wuxia genre, which is set in Ancient China and usually tells tales about swordsmen. The word wuxia means ""swordsman,"" and there is a lot of swordplay in this genre. ""Hero"" is packed with lots of swordplay, all well-choreographed and have lots of complex, elaborate moves. It is a pleasure to watch this film's eye-candy fights. Like most films in this genre, ""Hero"" has supernatural elements in it, such as fighters defying gravity and flying (a trademark in this genre). The flying scenes are breathtaking and fun to look at.Other than the fight scene, this film is beautiful. The cinematography is gorgeous, taking place in exotic places in Asia such as the forest, lakeside, and desert. Christoper Doyle has some great scenery here. The sets are realistic and accurate, not to mention to costumes. You can feel as if you're in that time. Plus, the score by Tan Dun (who previously worked in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"") (using traditional Chinese flutes and violins, Japanese drums, and some Western classic music) captures the mood of the story.""Hero"" was made in mainland China, unlike ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", which was made in Taiwan or most Kung Fu flicks, mostly made in Hong Kong. ""Hero,"" released in 2003, was nominated for the Oscar for best foreign film but lost to ""The Barbarian Invasions."" But nevertheless, it was a success at the US box office and received generally good reviews from most critics on its 2004 US release. It was followed later by another Chinese film, ""House of Flying Daggers,"" also by Zhang Yimou and stars Zhang Ziyi, who plays Moon in this film.""Hero"" is one of the best Asian films I've seen.",Hero

It also is full of odious and ham-handed authoritarian ideology that I'd think would be roundly condemned by American audiences (if we ourselves weren't currently engaged in an orgy of government-power worship, that is).
The twists and turns, meant to make a Rashomon-like movie engaging, are in fact flat and uninteresting. The human drama is mawkish and uninvolving.
I'll readily admit that it's quite an eyeful, but even then the combat sequences wear on the viewer after a while, and floating warriors who fight off millions of arrows with their pinky strain the credulity of adult Western moviegoers very quickly. I have a sense that the curse of American self-consciousness is at play here -- that people are simply scared to criticize a foreign movie which takes itself very seriously for fear of being seen as unsophisticated or not ""understanding"" the movie.

I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Lost Bladesman (Guan Yun Chang)"" 2011 which depicts this tradition. With each version depicted Broken Sword attempts to be closer and closer to the emperor at his throne. The costumes of characters at varying stages in the story line (red, green, white, and blue) symbolizes life's elements of passion, youth, truth, and love-- cleverly written and choreographed into film. The analogy of Chinese calligraphy with the sword are perfectly described as an art more than a crafted skill. The Chinese calligraphy are a beautiful art.

I had the idea that marital arts movies would be bloody-thirsty and probably gory, but not at all.I don't know how accurate the story was historically, but I thought the film gave a fascinating insight into ancient Chinese culture, a civilisation that existed a thousand years ago.A few of the actors were familiar, Jet Li, Maggie Chung and Ziyi Zhang.

The really strange thing is that it in some ways is, but that doesn't make the film bad. Hero makes use of some of the same scenery, it has a very melodramatic story, the music is very similar, and not least they have flying sword fights, but here is where similarity largely ends. Take acting, for example. It is much more ""iconic"" in style. It looks more like an ongoing choreography than real acting, but that doesn't hurt the film. In fact it only supports the very symbolic use of color and the fact that the film is about one of the greatest legends in Chinese history. Yes, Hero uses many of the same techniques as in ""CTHD,"" but goes way beyond in the use of symbolism - and it works. It has a much more thoughtful use of style, and unlike ""CTHD"" it seems to try to differentiate between ""reality"" and ""fantasy"" inside the premise of the genre. The only thing I really have against such a heavy use of stylistic tools is that it where ""CTHD"" gets warmer, Hero gets more stylish - or cold, if you will. So, in conclusion, Hero is definitively a film worth a second or third look, but sadly, because of its many similarities, will never really get away from the shadow of its forerunner, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (which bye the way is itself a pure remake).",Hero
251,shervinv,very mixed feelings,6,23 September 2004,"First of all I read several reviewers on this one and I think they really overrated this film. The movie obviously is a Crouching Tiger ripoff, in terms of style and action. I'd say it has much better visuals than Crouching tiger, but it pales in comparison when it comes to plot. There were many amazing visuals in this film (did I say that already? Well, it's because there really isn't much else). I found the story overly melodramatic, even laughably at times. The movie jumped into another long martial arts ""ballet"" way too many times. It reminded me of a musical, where the actors break into song 10 times too many and you find yourself actually bored by it at some point.

Landscapes seem to breathe.  Sets are more real than real. I'd heard that a lot of this film was shot on actual ancient locations in China, and it certainly seems to be the case. The action is oddly paced for American audiences, but once you let yourself fall into this movie it absorbs every crumb of your attention.  You *believe* in these people. The message at the end, which some here are misinterpreting as the crushing of the individual, is one of profound depth . . . that the highest expression of the warrior's art is to make war no more, to move beyond the need for it.  To see that the trivial battles of the moment are in the long run more harmful than helpful. Like ""Crouching Tiger"", the film holds the audience spellbound despite the undubbed Chinese dialogue.  The actors' lines are sparse anyway, and the subtitles never seem to intrude or break the fourth wall. This one's going to be a classic, like ""Seven Samurai"" from a generation ago.",Hero

It seems to have some special attractions.Maybe because it is too beautiful and arty: The mountains, lakes, deserts and ubiquitous winds, the fighting scenes (although sometimes not realistic), the yells during the fighting (borrowed from Peking Opera), some creative SFX and super cool body movements.In a summary, this movie is recommended for a viewing.

257,deepion,you've read the reviews... so is it really worth seeing?,10,5 October 2004,"As you might have read, 'Hero' (Ying Xiong) is either a movie you love or hate. However, it's hard to tell through all the praise and hatred that surrounds this movie whether it's actually any good. 'Hero', (or to give it it's full western title: 'Quentin Tarantino Presents Jet Li's Hero'), is not a movie for the average movie-goer. For a start, it's subtitled (for now anyway, no doubt the DVD release will have a dubbed track). This has already got a lot of people against the movie. It seems westerners can't be bothered with reading subtitles (which I find very unsettling). The plot is also slightly skewed (it aims to follow the same line as movies such as 'Memento' or 'Kill Bill' by mixing up events), but instead of being in a mixed order, the events are told as a continuing story. However, as each chapter is ended a new truth is discovered and it goes back to the beginning of that chapter and plays out again. With the new information in mind, the whole movie changes, including the characters, which can make things confusing. I've noticed a lot of people didn't like this repeat of ideas, but i actually found it very clever. It gives new ways of looking at the movie and with a change of colour scheme in every change-over it's definitely a bold move but it works really well. Speaking of the colour scheme, this is where the movie is at it's most excellent. Not with the plot or ideals but with the cinematography. As most people know, the reason you go to see 'Hero' is for all beautifully choreographed fight scenes and stunning grandness of ever scene. It is an amazingly beautiful movie, which uses all the best cinema tricks (including great camera wide shots and close up action sequences), and a few new tricks to create a visually stunning movie. However, is this beauty enough to cover up the problems with the script and plot? When you watch the movie you have to let yourself go and just let the movie engulf you. This way you will find that the plot actually makes more sense. The small script is enough to keep your attention whilst the actual visuals fills in the gaps. The tiny dialogue actually works with the visuals to create a movie with a wonder which stays with you long after the movie is over. The movie is also very comedic in places, making the movie more enjoyable without making a mockery of itself. The movie is also good in the fact that the characters are actually believable. You get to see everyone's character played out in full as each different take on a scene introduces a new personna of a person. This movie is doing well in cinemas at the moment so it must be doing something right. Of course, it's not on par with the likes of 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' (Wo Hu Cang Long), and it looks to be overshadowed by the upcoming Asian movie 'House of Flying Daggers' (which is a much better title that it's alternative title, 'Lovers') (Shi Mian Mai Fu), due in cinemas this boxing day. 'Hero' wasn't very popular in Asia, where most people thought it was more aimed at caucasians. Which is true, the movie isn't aiming to be politically correct, it is a movie after all, but neither was 'Crouching Tiger'. So, it does have it's faults, but it's definitely worth seeing. Many people may not enjoy it, but if you liked 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' it's a good night out. Of course, if you prefer something a bit more entertaining and less controversial, there are plenty of other movies to go see, but 'Hero' is one of those movies that will be remembered for it's sheer beauty rather than it's actual content. It's a little different than most movies, but very enjoyable, a must for fans of Asian cinema. The choice is yours.",Hero

259,esc_oblivion,"Tears running down my face... ""All under Heaven.""",10,30 May 2004,"This is a film that means a great deal to me. All too often we're asked ""what's your favorite movie?"" All too often I forget how much this film means to me. If ""favorite movie"" means ""most signifigant"" then Hero is my favorite movie. I cannot remember a movie that has made me sob every time I watch it. Understand that I'm a guy, and given as most guys to limited range of emotional expression. This film is perhaps the greatest film *ever* made. It's beauty, intelligence, storytelling, soul, craft, dialogue, acting, directing, writing... it is all exceptionally without flaw. If I ever make a film this great I will count myself as blessed beyond my greatest hopes. Unlike some movies which bring tears because of the spirit and intentions of the film - but which are flawed in other respects (Gladiator, Braveheart, etc) this film is one that brings torrents of tears and each one of them is more precious than platinum. It is the story of four larger than life assassins, and one larger than life Emporer. It is a story about the value of the human life, and the cause which is worthy of the giving that priceless life for. I purchased it probably about a year or so ago on import DVD-9 from Hong Kong. It is my most prized film. Even though I don't understand a word of Chinese, the connection that this film build to my heart every time I watch it is like the Mississipi; wider than the eye can see, deeper than many lakes...full of that which is essential to the provision of continuing life. Unlike other bitter-sweet films, Hero makes me so grateful for everything it is that having to use the only accurate literal phrase ""bitter-sweet"" becomes just a necessary evil - a byproduct of a limited language. This film MUST be seen at least once in your life... And, if you aren't touched by it, I highly suggest revisiting your inner depths and working to repair your heart and soul - until you do finally understand this films' greatness. Outstanding.",Hero
260,anicerman,The Best? Not so,5,14 November 2006,"It's taken so long for Chinese films to go to Hollywood. But be warned this is never one of the best you can get.The plot is set in the Qin Dynasty. The King of Qin, who is likely to unify China at that time, has long been worried about being assassinated. He fears the three famous assassins. But they're then said to be defeated by Nameless, which makes the King summon Nameless. But in fact this is all planned for Nameless to come to the King.I will not say the story is impressive because I've read a similar but better story written by a famous Chinese writer.Yimou Zhang wisely uses different colours to illustrate different emotions, which makes the whole picture extremely beautiful. Yet the so long story-telling may not be very pleasant, especially when the stories told by Nameless are of not much importance.With Yimou Zhang's own fame, the best, I would say, actors and actress in Hong Kong (Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung) and China (Daoming Chen) play the leading roles. But I'm not satisfied with their performance in the film probably because the characters in the film are not quite suitable for them. Take the King of Qin. The King of Qin is said to be a very fierce man, but the King in the film is so much softened. The worst actress must be Ziyi Zhang. I really can't relate her to the film much and most of the time she's just yelling loudly, which is really distracting.I understand why Hero hit the box office in western countries, but if you watch the early films directed by Yimou Zhang like Raise the Red Lantern, you will find Hero is not the best of his and is probably overrated.",Hero

This movie was no different. The story is somewhat tricky to follow but in the end you know what has happened. While watching the movie though I found myself so caught up in the visuals I wasn't even reading the subtitles. The scenery, score, sounds and photography are absolutely breathtaking. The actors do such a good job conveying emotion I almost didn't have to keep reading the subtitles to know what was happening. My favorite scene was between Flying Snow and Moon.

I particularly applaud the use of color in this film and would use it as an exemplar in a film appreciation class for that purpose. But this film moves way too slowly, and the reasons are the action sequences and the lack of story. The fight scenes are too artificial. As you may guess, I was also not thrilled with ""Crouching Tiger"" and if I am missing anything, perhaps it is the reason for a fascination with fantasy during such scenes that utterly takes you out of the moment. I don't want to see people mystically defying gravity and doing mid-air stunts for 5 minutes. A little more Bruce Lee and a little less Disney would be nice. It also needed more storyline and less ""action"" although the latter is questionable as it was about as believable as a James Bond film.More exposition and more realistic martial artistry would have made this film as good as everyone else is saying it is.",Hero

While this might be pleasing to a lot of folks, it certainly doesn´t meet my expectations regarding movies.

It takes place during Qin dynasty, when the emperor's desire to expand and centralize the neighboring states under one unique power gained him a few determined enemies, among the people he conquered. The confrontation emperor vs. emperor's assassins ultimately raises a few issues to consider: the obvious and not so obvious meanings of war, death, revenge. The strength of the movie lies in the visual means of telling the story. Images, settings, colors (there is a dominating type of color for each important sequence), characters' appearances and moves, they are all perfectly selected to suggest the different moods and attitudes involved.

Possibly they have a deeper meaning (4 seasons?), but it´s better to sit and let the colors make an impression on you. From this point it would be an 10/10 movie.Then there are the Martial Art and the effects. They looked to me very unnatural. It´s so obvious the actors are hanging on some thin ropes.

270,jscontoyannis,Outstanding visual feast with a more than adequate plot.,9,18 March 2005,"Zhang Yimou is truly a visual artist. While I won't compare him to Kurosawa in terms of his prowess as a director, he does share one similarity to the great master of Asian cinema: Many of the scenes/images in this film are practically paintings, rather than simple frames of a movie. A perfect example would be the shot of the unnamed walking towards the King's chambers through tens of thousands of guards. The overwhelming see of black, with colors interspersed and a lone figure walking past this sea of armor is truly epic art. The colors are vibrant, Tan Dun's accompanying score is beautiful and haunting, and the action (while limited) is more dance-like than it is pure violence.The storyline is similar to Rashomon, in that the protagonist, the unnamed (Jet Li), is brought before the emperor after slaying 3 powerful would-be assassins; Sky, Snow, and Broken Sword. He tells the emperor of how he managed to complete this impossible task. As the movie progresses, we hear several different variations of this story: The one which unnamed tells, followed by the emperor's response to the story of what he believes actually happened, followed by the real truth concerning what happened. It is masterfully woven and Yimou's use of color themes to separate these perspectives is wonderfully done.Some of the effects are absolutely breathtaking. The sequence in which Donnie Yen and Jet Li face off while a blind man plays them a tune is simultaneously kinetic and poetic. When Moon (Zhang Ziyi) faces of against Snow (Maggie Cheung) following the latter's killing of Broken Sword (Tony Leung), the first version of the tale reaches its climax visually and chromatically. The sequence where unnamed and Snow defend the calligraphy school from the deadly arrows of Qin is also a lesson in beautifully coordinating CGI with live-action. The scene where the unnamed and Broken Sword duel on the lake...the list goes on and on.While the movie is very different from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, fans of that movie should still watch this one. There aren't as many battle scenes, but in terms of epic backgrounds, lush costumes and emotion, this movie matches CTHD. Fans of beautiful imagery in general should watch this, actually. Some reviewers have complained that the end of this film carries with it a pro-communist message, but I feel as though this sentiment is too short-sighted; it is more of an idealistic, large minded-view than it is a communist view. And it reads too much into the intentions of the film. Just sit back and enjoy the movie for what it is: A visual feast with gorgeously choreographed action and a plot to boot.If you really like it, try to find the full-cut of this movie, which is available for region-1 as a Chinese import. The subtitles aren't as well-done, but there are additional scenes which, while they do not alter the story in any way, add to the general mood and feel of the work substantially in my opinion.Beautiful movie, 9/10 stars.",Hero

275,rserrano,Haunting beauty and provocative message,10,2 January 2005,"Hero is noteworthy on at least two counts.First, there are scenes of haunting beauty(""Duel in the yellow forest"" and ""Turquoise autumn"" to site a couple) that, like the best of impressionist paintings, are so affecting that you will forever see the world in a slightly different way having once beheld them.Secondly, the overall message of the film is a provocative one. The claim is that a degree of human casualties and suffering may be the optimal path to a better world, especially when the alternative is equally brutal chaos. This is not a popular theme. It has become much more fashionable to be anti-war in all cases. And understandably so, since variations of this logic have often been used in the past to justify atrocities. But the film provides a crisp litmus test for avoiding delusion: action must be taken with a heart void of malice and an unwavering commitment to the broadest possible ultimate outcome of good for all. Can anyone live up to this standard? Several characters in the movie do, each in their own way. If the standard could be met, would the world be a better place? These are questions worth reflecting on that have not been dealt with, to this depth, in any film I'm aware of.",Hero
276,Dhawley-2,"Beautifully filmed with an interesting historical theme, yet...",6,10 January 2006,"Having just watched this film for the first time (although it was released some time ago), my reaction is not quite as gushing in praise as other reviews, in spite of many impressive elements. Jet Li is a charismatic presence who possesses some of the most amazing martial arts skills to be seen anywhere. He's turned out some very entertaining films, from his early Chinese productions ('Once Upon a Time in China', parts 1-3, 'Fist of Legend') to his more mainstream Hollywood films ('The One', 'Romeo Must Die', etc.). It was, then, with anticipation that I put the DVD of 'Hero' in, set audio option for 'Mandarin DTS', with English subtitles, and hit the 'play' button. The movie began solidly, telling the tale of the Nameless warrior recounting to the Emperor (through flashbacks) his battles with three skilled assassins (see other reviews for more detail of plot). But as the film progressed, I became increasingly let down. But first, the positive aspects: the story line, polemics included, was an interesting philosophical exercise, well analyzed by other reviewers. The photography was, without question, beautiful. The use of certain dominant color schemes with each of Nameless's battle scenes was wonderful to behold, and added a rich emotionalism to the action. And, to be sure, there were some impressive swordplay and fighting scenes. The problem I had with the film was two-fold: first, and of less import, was that some of the many scenes between two of the assassins (Broken Sword and Flying Snow) dragged on too long, with too much contrived emotion between the two. But most negatively for me was the excessive use of 'wire fu' throughout. For this film fan, to see people ignoring the law of gravity and flying around like Peter Pan, soaring over tree tops, walking on water (literally) and controlling nature by creating windstorms, etc. with the wave of a sword leaves me cold. Try as I might, I cannot take any movie seriously that employs such ridiculous imagery. I don't mind trick camera work, a little CGI and other film tricks to make fight scenes exciting, but this nonsense (as was the case in 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon') just causes me to shake my head and lose interest. I realize others will strongly disagree, and consider this film to be among Jet Li's finest. While, as mentioned, I enjoyed his character, the lavish photography and the philosophical elements dealt with, the cartoonish wire-fu fight scenes (and there were many) almost ruined it for me. While I've not seen all of Jet Li's films, among the several I have seen, I rank 'Fist of Legend' and 'Kiss of the Dragon' his best. To be honest, even some of his lesser films ('Romeo Must Die', 'The Enforcer') were more realistic and, consequently, more enjoyable than this gorgeous but flawed film. I give it a score of 6 out of 10.",Hero
277,Deckard42,Beyond images and words,8,30 September 2007,"""Hero"" was one of the movies I liked from the first minute watching it. Although it has some ideas and characterizations I would generally dislike it has left some deep impressions - in some sense it gives you insight into something hardly reachable by images and words:Looking at the portrayal of the characters, one could find them superficial and hardly realistic. Most of them are exceedingly over glorified - as the English title already says, they are partly portrayed only as ""Hero's"", with almost no further dimensions. The story and the events lack any realism at all - one is obviously watching a fairy tale.And at this point you have to accept all those clichés as the means of any fairy tale - and remember that they serve telling an allegory. Otherwise you will miss the quintessence: This movie gives insight into something beyond images and words, a state of mind you probably can only experience. The state in which everything goes with ease and your actions seem to be guided by an inner flow. And this is what you could probably try to call it today, the state of ""flow"".The unspeakably beautiful images serve this and every other aspect of the movie, making it not at last one of the most marvelous fairy tales ever told.As far as for political dimensions, I for my part haven't noticed them when watching the movie - but of course if you apply the fairy tale's ending on todays china and its people - which I do not find entirely convincing - you will get a horrible message.",Hero
278,Chris Engelbrecht,Henhao - very good,10,6 April 2003,"As a movie goer that generally knows very little about China and Chinese tradition, I watched this movie with awe and amazement. Its message is simple and talks about honor and duty, as it was in 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. The caracters in Hero (In Mandarin: Ying Xiong) are not as complex as in 'Crouching Tiger...', but Hero's story goes further than its predecessor in that it takes a political stand. It's a story about a viscous king maturing to a wise emperor, worthy of managing 'all beneath the sky'. It's a story of valiant legendary warriors willing to sacrifice their own lives to ensure a higher purpose beyond any king or emperor. It's a story about the little man educating the big man through deeds worthy of remembrance. I can imagine this plot is a center piece of Chinese people's self understanding, something they carry with pride. For me as a bloody Westerner, I get a kick out of it, too.This film is beautiful. No lesser word can describe it. The camerawork is extraordinary, the use of colors fabulous. The use of slow motion is sublime, the kung-fu is in a class no one in the West can muster. I didn't notice any CGI during the movie, or though I can imagine rain droplets, yellow leaves or multitudes of arrows could have been CGI. As in 'Crouching Tiger...' caracters are capable of flying to right and left, something that I suppose is as natural in Chinese legends as the magic in the Lord of the Rings.Don't ask me about the acting, I'm a Westerner that has hardly seen any Chinese films...yet. However, Jet Li's stone face is perfect for the warrior Nameless, sitting merely 10 paces before the king, patiently waiting to unleash the blow of deliverance. (Watch the film to see what I mean.)
All in all, the film is mysterious to me, it's a China filled with wonder and fascination. It's 2500 years of applied philosophy that provides a little hope for this mess of a world we live in.All beneath the sky...that is SO cool!",Hero
279,TheFiddler,My First Chinese Movie in ages ***Spoilers***,9,14 January 2003,"Just saw Hero last night and am still overwhealmed. To be honest it takes a lot as a gweilo to not be disappointed by the fighting scenes and the way they jump between tree branches and over a lake and stuff. But hey I loved The Lord of The Rings and aren't Cave Trolls and Orks part of Western Mythology. Apart from feeling a bit odd watching these fighting scenes, THEY ARE JUST WONDERFULLY SHOT, especially the one on the water. Getting the story delivered from a different point of view makes it even more interesting as only the end reveals what really was going on. The costumes are fantastic, the locations they have shot this one in so breathtaking that I would wish I would have given movies like this a chance earlier. I cannot imagine watching this movie dubbed in english. Everyone who has the chance to watch it in mandarin with subtitles, give it a try, only like this , the movie feels authentic. Great actors, great dialogues, but honestly speaking I do not think that westerners who aren't in touch with chinese mentality, history and lifestyle will give too much about it....

280,the_usual_suspect,A most beautifully questionable film,7,24 December 2004,"After two years of hearing about the myth of the most expensive Chinese film ever made, Hero has finally floated on to British cinema screens. As it flies, it trails a coloured cloth that carries the film's numerous morals and messages which descend upon you like a soft layer of fabric. This is a film that can lift your spirits and have you laughing out in sheer joy as you gaze in wonder at the perfection of the mise-en-scene and cinematography. That is, if you let the film take you on a journey, without pondering the films questionable plot points.Hero is two sides of a tale as presented by Nameless (Jet Li), a mere Prefect who defeated three deadly assassins, and the King of Qin (Daoming Chen), the man the assassins wished to kill. Nameless weaves his heroic though modest story of how he killed the assassins, but the King remains unconvinced, spinning his own version of how he believed events unfolded.Director Yimou Zhang takes us through Nameless' story first, spreading the battle sequences thick, allowing them to take their own time. In the King's version, certain battles are then revised, which is remarkably brave considering that some battles are utter fabrications. In one such fictitious fight, in a faultlessly designed set, Nameless and Sky (Donnie Yen) close their eyes and fight out the battle within their minds. Screen time is being spent lavishly on showing how two characters contemplated a fight, whilst fighting each other in a battle that never occurred. It is confusing certainly, but perhaps Zhang wished for his audience to get lost in the plot's design so that they would not question the warrantability of half of the battle sequences, which make up most of the film.Yet, it is difficult to ponder these details when they are made so utterly insignificant when viewing such a spectacle. The sheer beauty of the battles, the gentle floating of the assassins as they fly around their arenas (which range from a forest full of orange leafed trees, crisp leaves falling down to the ground like rain, to the crystal clear and calm of a mountain lake), the costumes of characters at varying stages in the story line (red for passion, green for youth, white for truth, blue for love), the amazing army scenes which feature thousands of arrows being fired into the sky to create a black cloud that descends right on top of the camera, all these elements combine to produce a faultlessly perfect image on the screen, each frame a worthy photograph that gently reminds you why cinema is the greatest art form of the twentieth century.And characterisation is not lost in this beauty as one may have feared. Despite the irritating two dimensional performance of Zhang Ziyi as Moon, the other actors carry off fine performances, especially Tony Leung Chiu Wai as Broken Sword and Daoming Chen as the King. Their performances are especially credible as they are often drowning in the memories of the King and Nameless - they need to change slight mannerisms in order to reflect whose mind they are now in.The script too is of an impressively high standard. The moments of clarity that the warriors feel are experienced by the audience also, and there are some very informed outlooks of the emptiness of warfare, communicating that to achieve peace, sometimes war is the only option. These messages of course seem fitting in our current times, underlining how ancient some of the methods of our governing body truly are. Hero is undoubtedly a most beautiful and awe inspiring film. What it lacks in plot substance, it makes up for with structure and script. It elaborates on the ground work created by 'Crouching Tiger' and is an experience that I would encourage you to seek out, as long as you are willing to submit to the film and let it guide you through its world on its own terms.Rating: 4/5",Hero
281,kris-oak,A camera-painters view on the origin of China,10,18 March 2006,"Hero is as said by fellow reviewers to be something extraordinarily beautiful and I cannot but completely agree. It beautiful both in form and plot, which seem to have been created to intertwine seamlessly.Cinematographer Chris Doyle, often working with Wong kar-Wai, has been given the possibility to use colours without restraint and has used this possibility to its full potential. Yimou has never failed me so far when it has turned to humanistic plots, and Hero is no exception. The misconceptions that it has no plot, probably finds its foundation in the mythological landscape of ancient China. Here we deal with things that occurred during the emperor Chi'n, the founder of China, and a mythological person himself, almost. The spectra of other persons or creatures in the plot often have names like wind and such, making it possible to see that this picture acts at many levels and that as it concerns the struggle between persons it might also concern the struggle of the forming of a young nation, against the elements here in anthropomorphic mould . It is a myth and a saga....Now I know absolutely nothing about Chinese culture, nothing worth a dime in something more than a lottery anyway...but this I know; Yimou has here created a masterpiece working on many levels which still set my mind on philosophical thoughts at the same time as I get blown away by fantastic action and incredible imagery all painted by the masters of Chinese film ( even if at least one of them is native Australian.)",Hero
282,Shabadoo-2,Brilliant and Beautiful,10,31 August 2004,"This is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. Excellent acting, storytelling, cinematography, and some of the best martial arts fights ever filmed.The tone is very somber and humorless, but the beauty of the fights and settings brings unexpected lightness. And while the storytelling is a bit heavy-handed, it's appropriate. This is a piece about a cornerstone of Chinese history, told as a fantasy.Jet Li is brilliant. His fight with Donnie Yen is awesome. But it's Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung who steal the show. Their chemistry is intensely believable and they give the film intimacy.The story at first seems very shallow--a Kung Fu assassin plot. But it gets deeper and while it's not the most brilliant thing ever written, it serves as more than just a vehicle to move from one fight to the next.Too bad the hype for this film is so huge. And it bothers me that every other critic feels compelled to compare it to ""Crouching Tiger."" This movie stands on its own as a true work of art that just happens to be entertaining.",Hero
283,SyxxNet,Incredible...just incredible...,10,27 August 2004,"I have just seen ""Hero""...and words simply cannot comprehend what I have seen....I can say this...It is the most incredible film I have ever seen. I count Crouching Tiger and the Lord Of The Rings trilogy among my favorite movies of all time. All of them have brought me in tears at one point or another...""Hero"" left me sobbing uncontrollably at the end...and wanting desperately to see it again.Told with masterful craft, Hero shifts back and forth between story and flashback, and what took place in the past, when a group of assassins consipire to assassinate the man who rules this version of China.Jet Li and Daoming Chen, as Nameless and the King of Qin, respectively, offer up both thoughtful and action filled performances. But Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung Chiu Wi steal the movie out from underneath Li as the crossed lovers Broken Sword and Flying Snow. Their story, told several different ways, will leave many people breathless trying to discern who's version of their relationship is the truth.Zhang Ziyi, as my better half put it, is one of the most beautiful young women on Earth. And although her role is smaller than one might expect, it is pivotal to the story.This cast weaves the tale so wonderfully, and brings you into their minds so masterfully, that you are simply drawn into the intricate details of their plotting and planning from each person's point of view.The special effects are absolutely beautiful to watch, especially the incredible sword fight near the beginning of the movie with Nameless taking on Long Sky, played by legendary martial arts actor Donnie Yen. The incredible use of the rain, and the water, will leave even the most cynical person dazzled. I know, I was with one.The score, by Tan Dun (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) and performed by legendary violinst Itzhak Perlman, is, like CTHD before it, simply mesmerizing. They are aided by several other musicians and the drumming troupe TODO, who I am a huge fan of anyway, thanks to Elvis Stojko using their beats for several of his skating routines. All the elements combine to make Hero a true experience.I cannot say it enough. So let me say it again -  ""Hero"" is NOT a movie; it's an EXPERIENCE.My score- 10+++ (out of 10)",Hero

285,ciarandino,martial arts masterpiece,10,9 October 2012,"This truly is one of the greatest films I have ever seen in my life. It is very much a masterpiece. It is a highly evocative and deep film. Everything is top-notch. The acting, the lighting, the visuals, the musical score, the choreography, everything is just so wonderful.The movie is about China before it became a single united land and was a series of warring nations. A nameless warrior comes before the king of the nation Qin having slain his three greatest foes, the assassins known as Sky, Broken Sword and Snow. As he tells his story, however, the king works out that Nameless is lying to get closer to him, and the truth begins to unravel.This is a film that makes you sympathize with all of the characters. The king of Qin, though at first he may appear to be little more than a tyrant, is eventually revealed as a man who longs for peace, peace that he wishes to achieve through uniting all the nations. You sympathize with the assassins because what they have gone through is harsh. It is understandable that they wish to kill the king of Qin because their nation has suffered because of him.The score heightens the emotions of the film, and it is a very beautiful and touching score. The visuals are just stunning, and the movie uses locations, set pieces, choreography and colour spectacularly, and the results are a treat for the eyes.This film is without a doubt a work of art and a masterpiece. Any-who, that's my review, so I must bid you adieu.",Hero
286,cvincent1,"O, for such a Hero...",10,1 January 2005,"This is a beautiful, excellent film. It repays repeated watching, as well.It is exciting, stunning, touching, and glorious. The stars are well-used: Jet Li is his cute, enigmatic, impressive self as the Nameless hero. Maggie Cheung is dignified, beautiful, and amazing as Flying Snow. Tony Leung does a wonderful turn as the assassin Broken Sword, a man who has achieved an insight all his fellows have missed. Donnie Yen, so charming as the father Wong Ki Ying in Iron Monkey, gives an incredible performance as Sky. Zhang Ziyi is, as so often, heartbreakingly gorgeous as Moon. She's even better here than she was in Crouching Tiger, without stealing the show! The locations are dazzling, the cinematography breath-taking, and the score exquisite. I can't say enough good about this film-- if you enjoy it, it's also worth checking out ""The Emperor and the Assassin"" for a more gritty take on the same story. This is not only a ""must see"". It's a ""must own"" on DVD.",Hero

Also the style of the the movie is fantastic, its once you look past those things to the plot and message of the movie that it loses its magnificance.SPOILERSDon't think I don't appreciate what the movie was trying to convey, I got the message loud and clear, it just all seemed pointless (especially when you find out about 80 percent of what you saw never happened).  In the end, everyone is dead except the person they originally wanted to kill.  And all in the name of bringing peace AKA the king can continue his conquest of the world?

291,Hansda_Sowvendra_Shekhar,"Confusing Plot, Charismatic Visuals",8,19 March 2009,"'Ying Xiong' is quite confusing. Jet Li's character Nameless tells so many stories to the King of Qin (played by Chen Dao-ming) and I couldn't keep up with any of the stories. And because these stories were shot in so many colours matters were even more confusing. I was too busy gawking at the screen, going ""Oh! my, that is wonderful"" and in the meantime, another story passed me by.Zhang Yimou's story is grand. Three warriors, each one better than the other, from the different warring provinces the King of Qin wants to unify under his rule, come together to assassinate the King. Since killing the King is no easy task, they hatch a plan. 'Ying Xiong' is the story of their plan and whether they are successful in killing the King and freeing their respective provinces.The three warriors have been played by three of China's best known actors. Tony Leung Chiu-wai as Broken Sword, Maggie Cheung Man-yuk as Flying Snow, and Donnie Yen as Sky. Jet Li  the most best known star in this film  plays a character called Nameless who is an official in the province of Zhao and who has, supposedly, killed all these assassins. Killing these assassins was difficult but now he is faced with the toughest task of all. Convincing the King of Qin that he has, indeed, finished the assassins.Zhang Yimou's scale is grander. If 'Wo Hu Cang Long' opened up the doors for classy kung-fu movies, 'Ying Xiong' could very well be considered the Mother of all Wo Hu Cang Longs. And that, perhaps, takes 'Ying Xiong' down.Time magazine, issue dated 21 January 2002, says this about 'Ying Xiong': ""Zhang Yimou's martial-arts epic 'Hero' has a boffo cast, a big budget, an award-winning crewand the burden of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'"" This burden sinks 'Ying Xiong'.'Wo Hu Cang Long' was simple, fluid and feminine. It had a linear plot with no twists and all. The serious Chow Yun-fat, the gorgeous Michelle Yeoh, the good bandit Chang Chen, and the cute little dynamite Zhang Ziyi were like people we know. Though the characters belonged to a different era, each one was like so familiar. Chow Yun-fat was like a father-figure, a man we could always rely upon. Michelle Yeoh was like an aunt or an elder sister, one who does embroidery, makes tea, keeps secrets, gives the best advice. Chang Chen was like this neighbourhood lout who climbs trees, plays games on the street, bullies young children. And Zhang Ziyi, well, she's like that daddy's spoilt daughter who wants to run away, try a bold dress or hairdo, mix with the guys, stuff like that. In 'Ying Xiong', you could hardly identify with a character. There are stars, my god, all of them. But that connection with them is missing. Plus, there are so many sub-plots, a different colour for each one of them  red, blue, green, white, yellow  and these sub-plots (the entire film, actually) has been shot so well, so well, that this beauty just acts as a distraction. The actors put in a great job, a very great job, but somehow it is only the non-action scenes that stand out. The action scenes seem so unconvincing and (after 'The Matrix' and 'Wo Hu Cang Long') so repetitive.The technical aspect is the real star. Christopher Doyle  Wong Kar-wai's right-hand man  could actually shoot day scenes. I've seen Doyle's work only in Kar-wai's films  'Cheun Gwong Tsa Sit', 'Hua Wang Nian Hua', 'Chung Hing Sam Lam' and '2046'  and I had ended up believing that he specializes in no-lights photography. But his work in 'Ying Xiong' is so superb I had to change my opinion. Doyle could do anything.The music by Tan Dun sounds like 'Wo Hu Cang Long' but the tunes are different. Sounds good. Very good.Time magazine has gone ga-ga over the fight scene with Maggie and Ziyi (who has a very small role as Moon, Broken Sword's disciple). I found it quite ordinary. Maggie and Ziyi are just doing acrobatics and there are leaves flying around. Not that appealing. Plus, after seeing Maggie in Wong Kar-wai's films, it is hard to accept her doing action scenes. Ziyi is so lithe, plus, I still remember her as the girl who stole the Green Destiny, so, watching her doing action was more OK. Tony Leung's action scenes are nice. He carries this grave expression throughout and that saves him. Maggie looks good crying. Another Wong Kar-wai hangover. The action scene I particularly liked was the Arrow Deflecting scene featuring Jet Li and Maggie. It's amazing. The Lake fight scene is also good but it looks like an extended 'Wo Hu Cang Long' water-surface fight scene.I would give this film 9/10 for the technical aspects, which are the real stars; 9/10 for the acting because all actors are very good  Tony Leung, especially; 6/10 for the story because I ended up confused  although the end is nice, the reason that Broken Sword gives. That adds up to 24 out of 30. That is, 80 out of 100. So my rating is 8/10.",Hero
292,thefuzmixman,a confrontation between the good of one and the good of many....,7,1 January 2005,"If i had to give this movie a one word rating i would label it gripping. At times i felt that it did propel forward at a less then desirable pace, however this made what some might call a bit of exaggeration, seem more artistically refined. Definitely one great film with an excellent story so I understand why it's rated as high as it is here, (which i will admit was one of the larger contributing factors to me seeking out this film). What i found particularly strange about this movie is that i really didn't care how it ended. I put that much trust in the goal of the main character. Ironically, at the beginning of the movie i found myself doubting its high rating because of some rather iffy dialogue and exaggerated fighting, but then i came to realize that the power of some lines were probably lost during translation so i couldn't fault the movie for that and the fighting is still acceptable. So as the story progresses it becomes so engrossing, that i stopped asking questions and picking it apart. I just wanted to truly understand the vision of ""Hero"" in it's entirety.I will not try to pretend to understand the culture of ancient china or any of the symbolism in this movie, but i will say this. The director seemed to use colour to express certain theatrical emotions and I believe this idea was implemented most excellently. One particular scene that comes to mind is the fight with the King and Broken Sword during a flashback. As he approaches the kings palace,both him and snow are dressed in pale green garb and so are many silk drapes that decorate the area. This, plus the fact that the many soldiers that surround them are wearing dark colours allow for the effect to be well, quite effective. Just one example, but there still remain quite a few scenes like this, easily making Hero a very visually emotional accomplishment. There are some things i didn't like about the movie. I wasn't simply astonished from the fight scenes like i would've liked to have been. I didn't like this ""floating"" fight style very much in Crouching Tiger and i don't really like it that much in this film, either. For some reason even though they really try to make you see it as graceful, blending so many mini angles to achieve a sense of motion does the exact opposite for me and i see the scenes in pieces and it bugs me. using wires i believe can and has been done better, but that's just one trade off i can deal with.I noticed i didn't go into detail about the story but thats because many reviews here already have and i believe your should just watch the movie to determine whether or not you like it. I, personally think Hero is a great movie with a story that will draw you in, pick you up, and leaving you feeling emotions right along with the characters. I would recommend this to anyone interested in a movie with heart and a passion for honor, coupled with some good visual effects.",Hero
293,WolfGifford,I'm so bored with pretentious wire fights!!,1,23 March 2005,"Is it just me, or does any Asian based movie with some tedious wire work seem to be hailed as a masterpiece nowadays? Having been a huge fan of Asian martial arts since the early 80's I've been bored witless by the 'new mainstream' versions since the release of 'Crouching Tiger...' - which was hideous. Had that film not been directed by Ang Lee I doubt it would have received the reviews it did and that would have saved us from the martial arts mire we are in now. Now, with films such as these being so in-vogue (film students love them and enjoy using words like ""juxtaposition"" and ""use of the frame"" when talking about them)and the directors forgetting all about story and character and being obsessed with style I'm wondering how long they can keep churning out this tedious pap before people wise up? Before I get slated by film students let me say I did a three year degree in film so I know what I'm saying when I talk about you!! I was one of you!! 'Hero' is a perfect example of style over everything else. Slow, arty, very very boring. It all looks good but has no substance, no impact. But no one dare criticise it as it's art and they will accused of not understanding it or being unable to appreciate the directors vision.Well, maybe I didn't. But what I did do was go and see 'Ong Bak' a few days later and that made me feel much better. It was a breath of fun, violent and impressive fresh air. Especially in these days of over the top, jumped up, beautiful to look at wire fighting ****.",Hero
294,Hotwyre6,Poor Psychology,3,21 June 2006,"Hero falls into a category of beautifully designed Chinese dramas that weave unparalleled choreography into a timeless story. Unfortunately, the film seems to have gotten jumbled and some major character devices fell through onto the cutting room floor.Specifically, there is a moment when the character Broken Sword and his companion storm the Imperial Palace. The companion holds off 3000 body guards while Broken Sword challenges the emperor in single combat. This epic confrontation comes to a close when Broken Sword - on the verge of victory for his glorious agenda - abruptly decides that he is completely wrong about everything, and the King of Qin who has declared himself emperor has a most righteous agenda.Never mind the lack of anything the emperor may have said to give Broken Sword a change of heart. Disregard the fact that there is no indication in the dialog or even the subtext to indicate that Broken Sword is struggling inside. No, it just so happens that as he and his companion are facing innumerable odds and impossible circumstances to set right their perceived wrongs, and he is about to achieve his climactic and defining moment, that suddenly Broken Sword reverses his position 180 degrees, and instead of delivering the impending death blow on the adversary which caused him to dedicate decades of his life to this cause, he decides to walk away.The argument in question is whether or not a greater social order is worth the infringement upon the lives of single individuals. While the audience may be willing to listen to a certain amount of proselyting on this idea, there is next to nothing in the background to indicate why Broken Sword even had a change of heart. No scenes are shown demonstrating the marked difference between the beneficence of the emperor's rule and the previously divided land; it is just written into the dialog as if the missing allusions to Broken Sword's newfound philosophy were present from the beginning.This movie might rate higher in the minds of viewers to whom plot continuity and logic take a back seat to cinematography and scenery. To those who wish for a film to at least stay true to its theme, this one goes bust.",Hero

But before I went to sleep, I was treated to some of the most breathtaking cinematography I've ever seen. The fight scenes are all inspired and the colors are so vivid and beautiful to watch. (Especially ""Duel in the Yellow Forest""). Hollywood should plug one of these movies into their plot machine and make something with a story people can follow, but with the same depth and feeling as ""Hero."" The movie is about an attempt to assassinate a King, I think. But more importantly, the images sing like a sublime, romantic symphony. Coherent and linear storytelling might have been a distraction from the film's beauty. Forget the hazy, murky plot and just enjoy the colors, the characters, and their love and hatred for one another.",Hero

The story itself rang a bit hollow for me-- but as I am not Asian, I accept that I might not ""get"" all of the nuances of the film.I found it visually stunning.  Beautiful work with colors to represent perception.  The fight scenes in the rain and swirling leaves were the most memorable to me. This was not a kung fu movie, as many going to see it here in the US might think (and therefore be disappointed when they see it).  It is epic mythology-- much like the story of Troy... a real historical event embellished with larger than life figures, finishing off with moral lessons.  It was not the best film that I've ever seen, but not the worst, either.  I enjoyed it.  7/10.",Hero
297,TheHumbleCritic,"One of the slowest (I'm talking ""motion"" here) films ever made",3,1 February 2005,"In Zhang Yimou's newest film, ""Hero,"" bodies exquisitely fall in slow motion. They get up in slow motion too. They talk in slower motion. They run the physical gamut in slow motion while the audience yawns in real time. There are so many maudlin dramatic climaxes here to give Mel Gibson a run for his money.Yimou is no stranger to piling on heavy drama. His most restrained and distant film, ""Raise the Red Lantern,"" is consequently his best chiefly for those named reasons. It's when he gets up and close to his characters that we realize he actually doesn't have as much to say as when he's the ironical observer full of snobby, critic-like commentary. One doesn't need to be familiar with Yimou's other pictures to feel that ""Hero"" isn't ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" That second one, directed by Ang Lee, actually had something to say about the martial arts film, and its expertly staged fight scenes are also totally varied: each one does not duplicate or repeat a single time through the entire picture. ""Crouching Tiger"" also wove together two very distinct, parallel love stories that, though ideal, nevertheless realized both the passion and maturity that can come about in love regardless of age. Lee had a lot on his mind in that small masterpiece, and what made that film remarkable wasn't the marvelous acrobatics but the artistic and subtle meaning behind it (HK martial arts snobs will tell you that ""Crouching Tiger"" sucks because they've seen the flying before, obviously missing the point that Lee weaves floating through the air INTO THE PLOT, and doesn't just take it at face value). Sure, its weepy at points, but not without exquisite merits.But before I forget, this isn't a critique about a movie that gets it right, but how something actually very beautiful manages to get it quite wrong. Jet Li is an assassin supposedly hired to off some warriors, and as he reports to the emperor his stories, the audience realizes that (gasp!) not all is at it seems. Like a mystery, one plot twist is replaced by another until we finally come to the ultimate conclusion. Before I forget, the performances deserve some praise, specifically Zhang Ziyi and Maggie Cheung. To see Ziyi's manic teeter-totter between cold calculation and obsessive passion is why we watch movies. And the late Maggie Cheung's face is, quite simply, a face that is meant for the screen. Yimou understands this; he gets right up and close with his beautiful heroines and lets their anguish communicate everything in chilling screams and furious temper (maybe a bit too much though; the whole thing seems like one big Gregorian chant with every female moaning 'Yaaaa, ayaaaa, yaaaa!').More of them would have been welcome, but what we get instead is Jet Li fighting one guy in a traditional fight scene in normal, ho-hum everyday sword-fighting and flying speed, then the scene starts to move VERY SLOWLY. It's a novel idea at first; you know, what's emphasized is the natural elements surrounding the actors rather than the fight itself (because to do the latter would've been unbearably boring in slow motion). But Yimou doesn't relent; everything is dramatic in this movie so that nothing is left ordinary. Li fights EVERYONE slowly. One could imagine the cutting of a fingernail was inexorably dropped from the final print much to Yimou's objections, but it'll probably be included on the American DVD release.Since every fight scene is reduced to a crawl, they all seem executed similarly, with just a different setting and color scheme. It's all a lot of elaborate dance, an idea that sounds great, but really just looks silly. Watch the extended lake scene and you'll know what I mean. Some have said the last two crappy ""Matrix"" films did this; I guess I just find pirouetting CG incredibly boring. Did I mention that half the film is in slow motion? Fast forward the DVD to watch the film in its normal speed glory.Perhaps I've been too hard on the film. It is indeed gorgeous when it's not putting you to sleep, and the creators desire to create all costumes and set pieces from scratch rather than resorting to fake-looking CG should be admired. The backdrops have a genuinely natural, lush feel to them that is some of the prettiest moving color to ever grace the screen. Yimou color codes every story that Jet Li tells, so the audience is truly getting a variety in storytelling here, in narrative and striking visuals. It's no stretch to call ""Hero"" aesthetically more striking than ""Crouching Tiger,"" though far less subtle. For all the emphasis on color coding and repetition in cryptic motifs, though, we are supposed to forget about the soap-opera story and presentation. And beyond telling each story in a new beatific arrangement, there is little other point to the exorbitant display. Yimou might have learned something cheap from melodramatists Douglas Sirk, or maybe even his inferior tributaries like Todd Haynes. In other words, this is the perfect study for film school students.On a final note, and spoiler alert, I don't think the film really has a ""fascist"" message at all, and those that have described the film as such are playing loosely with the word, much like Roger Ebert does. It's a little insulting to respectable fascists everywhere. On the other hand, what IS there is a truly disgusting celebration of authoritarianism. Why should Jet Li lay down and sacrifice his life for an emperor who has shown no sacrifice of his own? If Jet Li is indeed the titular character, why should his act of sacrifice for the ambitions of an imperialistic state be considered heroic? This attitude is reflective of a tyranny that would like its citizens to obey and work for the good of the state, and it's a particularly dangerous mantra to adapt in the climate of today's world. Watch at your risk.",Hero
298,MissMovieLuver88,"Stunning, beautiful cinematography from Yimou!",7,22 January 2007,"I wanted to watch this purely because I enjoyed House Of Flying Daggers so much however I was slightly disappointed but not quite. Really Hero is an odd film to review. At times you're left wowed by typical Yimou cinematography then you're left confused by the plot. Nonetheless I did enjoy the stunning fight sequences and use of colour throughout and the chemistry between Maggie Cheung's character and Tony leung's; which is understandable considering they have worked together on numerous occasions.I've never actually seen a film with Jet Li in oddly. Usually because he just lacks that little something I like to see in actors and at times, what he acts in. He did act farely well but it wasn't particularly great considering he was in a Yimou film. I did get confused by his character, amongst other things. I couldn't quite make out what he purpose was as a character and why he is doing what he is doing. The characters of Maggie Cheng, Zhang Zi and Tony Leung were also confusing, again i just couldn't figure out what their purpose was and, again what the hell they are doing. I suppose my review is looking at little confusing while you are reading this, but you will see what I mean when you watch this.Overall a more stylistic piece of film rather than substance but it is worth watching if you're a Yimou fan for instance and to see why on earth Tarantino marketed the film himself rather than Yimou!",Hero
299,joseangeles,"Colorful lively visuals, dull lifeless story. What a shame.",3,11 September 2004,"The concept of flashbacks being told through different version was a disaster. It didn't flow naturally thanks to the tiring atmosphere. Same nonstop over-dramatic music that got to my nerves (very contrived and expects sappy music would win my emotions on cue, pfff, you'll have to do better than that). Symmetrical and colorful cinematography was impressive but played out too much. (More style than substance). The transitions to the present and past were sloppy too cause of the same gloomy tone of voice and simple choppy dialogue (although I think the Western distributors are to blame for that). The philosophy was typical. ""Sword fighting and (insert any non-violent art form) are the same"". There were too many pointless ""pissing-contest"" fights, which were too slick and unrealistic.Maybe I was expecting too much. I shouldn't expect much from anything in Century Theaters though. Also, like 70% of this movie is slow motion. Very unnecessary and tasteless. It's like adding too much wine in whatever someone cooks with wine. It's supposed to be exquisite, but becomes disgusting in large uncalled for volumes.This is not timeless classic material. I'm a big Asian cinema fan and felt this was just a flashy movie for pseudo-intellectual Americans to eat up and brag about how they're not stupid for not watching whatever mind-numbing Hollywood filth there is. Then they all pat themselves on the back for reading subtitles. This is Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon mania all over again.Colorful lively visuals, dull lifeless story. What a shame. Will amaze anybody that's new to this genre though/Century Theater mall-boppers in denial.",Hero

What i needed to make number 48 was something truly exceptional; Hero was exactly that.With respect, nothing in this Earth is perfect; 9.999 is about as close a rank i can give Hero. What i thought would be a re-run of 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' turned out to be an unbelievable experience that has raised the bar clean out of sight. A nameless warrior (Jet Li) is given time alone with the Great King to recount how he killed the three most deadly assassins in the land: Sky, Broken Sword and Flying Snow. With each story told the entire movie expands and contracts as multiple events eventually come together by the end, and what happens in between will break your imagination. The cinematography is something that inspires and amazes; you find yourself in awe that such beauty could be created on screen; the fights are expertly choreographed, directed and edited; the high wire methods allow for some of the worlds best fight scenes ever committed to screen. The movie creates it's own myth; shrouded in an invisible sheen of the stuff of legends. Some of the major army battle scenes force the viewer to go temporarily numb (Sky and Flying Snow take on the 3000 bodyguards as they launch their assault on the King's fortress/ the hundred thousand arrows ripping into a small calligraphy school as Li and Flying Snow try their best to shield Sky) What you see here is something you will find yourself watching over and over again, seizing the same amount of emotion that you did the first time, because no matter what, a Hero's spirit never dies.9.9/10 ***** A* Buy the DVD and experience true brilliance.",Hero
301,Aysen08,~ Enthralling ~,8,6 January 2005,"Not since Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon have I enjoyed a movie like this. The story is well done, and keeps you hanging as you try and figure out the truth behind the movies central characters: Nameless, Flying Snow, Broken Sword, & the King of Qin. In the tradition of the ending to Clue, it takes you through each scenario of what may have been as the watcher along with the King tries to decipher fact from fiction.The lead actors & actress are easy to watch and make you enthralled with the characters, especially as the plot takes twists. Pure enjoyment to love them one moment, hate them the next, and then find yourself identifying with them. A supporting performance by Ziyi Zhang as Moon, servant to Broken Sword is also well done as her role throughout the film changes in strengths along with the main characters.The fights move fluently and fun to watch. Anyone who is a fan of this type of martial arts film style should enjoy it. The scenery is lush and intense with vivid color changes and various terrains, pure candy to the eye. The elaborate set up of the two afore mentioned make for stunning effects as each of the stories unfold throughout the film.I enjoyed this movie best with the original mandarin tracks with English for the hearing impaired subtitles, for some reason the English dubbing was just too busy for me, and you don't want to miss any details.Overall, a true gem to watch. It earns a 8/10 from me.",Hero

It is a beautifully rendered, artfully constructed, and wonderfully choreographed masterpiece that must be seen by all movie watchers. THIS is what I would refer to as ""Art on film"". Martial arts fans will be happy, sword fight fans will be happy, and it's even a good date movie.I know almost nothing about Chinese history, so I can't speak to the political angle that this story takes, or to the accuracy of the story itself. Some have suggested that the plot does not reflect what the Chinese people really felt about the Emperor, nor did it accurately reflect the crimes or atrocities committed at the time. I cannot address those issues. I can only view this movie as a ""legend""-type movie and, as such, it's plausible enough and great fun to watch.I highly recommend that you watch ""Hero"" in DVD on as big a screen as you can.

I have not seen any movie with cinematography and choreography done in such pure artistic style, resulting in an almost surreal visual experience. By using traditional Chinese instrumental music, the score of the movie is also excellent. The story itself, though very much modernized and contrive, is actually somewhat believable ¨C stories of assassins at this particular time period were abundant. Most lead actors perform adequately, including Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung, Chen Dao Ming and Zhang Ziyi. But the substance does not measure up to the style. First of all, the dialog is just way too modernized, and at times very pretentious. Second, Jet Li may be the best martial artist ever on the silver screen, still he really cannot act. Since much of the movie depends on him delivering convincing lines, it just falls flat right here. A good film, for the visual and score along, but not a great one worthy of an Oscar.",Hero

It's the kind of movie that reaches a level that hordes of other movie makers only can dream about achieving. Every single scene is stunningly beautiful. Music, costumes, cinematography & acting is great & the whole experience is as close to perfection as anything human can get. The basic story is pretty simple. It's set in China around 2000 years ago & tells the legend of some incredible sword fighters who are involved in a plot to kill a warrior king. Still the story evolves in an ingenious way (reminiscent of another Asian masterpiece: Akira Kurosawa's 'Rashomon' from 1950), so we are guaranteed unpredictable development & spectacular fight scenes well beyond the standard Hollywood formula. But more than this, I conceive the film as a dazzling tribute to the amazing power of human imagination and the glorious beauty that we are able to produce through various works of art, whether it's music, calligraphy, sword fighting or movie-making. 'Hero' feels like a celebration of the depth of the human senses & everything that is colorful in this world. It's fascinating to see how director Zhang Yimou manage to merge great action & profound poetry without ever being boring or overly pretentious. I love this movie and rate it 10/10.",Hero
307,phoenix_100,Interesting and visually spectacular,9,11 January 2011,"Hero (2002) originally Ying xiong, is a Chinese drama/martial arts film based on ancient China (221-210BC) in which China was divided into several different nations. The film achieved a generally positive rating, so I decided to review it. It would be almost my third time watching this. Even though I knew the ending, I could somewhat expect what was going to happen, Hero still packed a punch. Filmed magnificently with a killer cast (Jet Li, Maggie Cheung, Ziyi Zhang, Donnie Yen) the film moved at a swift pace. For the entire duration (less then two hours), this filmed had always a level of suspense, the audience was always waiting to see what would happen next.The scenes were just extraordinarily filmed - one thing that I absolutely loved in all of the fighting scenes were the actual places that they were set in. Even though the martial arts in this film were simply, epic, the settings were amazing. In all of the fight scenes, the camera is never focused on the fighting, not directly, its focused on the settings themselves. From the beautiful instrumental played by the old man, accompanied with the drizzle of rain and the single drops as they splash against the oriental pavement. To the auburn leaves which are used as the setting and as a weapon. The film uses an array of different settings that make each martial arts scene unique as they are visually impressive.Another thing that should be noted is the use of colours. In the movie, Nameless, a low-rank officer claims to have defeated Sky (Donnie Yen), Flying Snow (Maggi Cheung) and Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai, or 'Little Tony') using his swift sword and wit. The film features three retellings - Nameless' version, The Emperor of Qins version and the Truth. It also has a minor scene in which it takes place in the past. Nameless' version is tainted red - something that can be said as being symbolic to hate and jealousy, but also of romance - in Nameless' version, Flying Snow and Broken Sword are displayed as being secret lovers that hate one and another now because of a past affair with Sky. In the Emperors retelling of what happened, the scenes are tainted blue, with robes and tapestries now a light blue. The Emperors version uses blue which, again, symbolically represents a sense of control, logic and calm reasoning. The colour green is used to tell what has happened in the past, green symbolizes, for me, balance, fearlessness, protection, calmness, truth and serenity - because the past has already happened, and so cannot directly endanger the future, which however is much the case. The third, and final retelling is toned white - white has always been considered a virgin colour, and hence would symbolize the truth and clarity of the subject.Hero is very well done film, visually spectacular and strong in its plot. Anyone looking for a relatively good length drama, action film, this is something you will have to look into - although historically not correct, the movie doesn't have any unrealism in it, which means a fast paced drama. 9/10.",Hero
308,rrv1,Hero review,4,8 March 2005,"I just recently had the opportunity to view the film Hero. It is filmed in Japanese dialect with English subtitles. I thought that this was an alright movie. I felt that it would have been a lot easier to understand if I had been more educated on the topic of Japanese culture and rituals. It was interesting to view the habits and rituals of a different culture, but at times I found myself very confused because I didn't know what was going on. The colors in the film were very pretty. There were many bright and vibrant color schemes that accented the movie and the scenery. I thought that Hero was good film, but I don't think that I would make an effort to see it again.",Hero
309,laviskrg,the movie that made my life complete,10,25 December 2005,"It is a very uncommon thing for me to be rendered speechless. But this spectacular Chinese masterpiece has certainly succeeded. It is the kind of movie that keeps you breathless until the end and afterwards, it makes you a part of the story, it shows you a totally different world, and you immediately see yourself out there, on the endless plains of China, or on the mirror-like lake, defying gravity and fighting a mystical battle, full of lust and technique. The story is over-whelming, it consists out of many unpredictable twists and turns, it gives the viewer a different perspective of life and its meanings. The plot, I believe, is very complex, and therefore, it can be slightly confusing, but, it remains breath-taking and magical. You will notice the ""Story in a story "" effect, as historical reality mixes with mystical fiction and with a heart-braking love story. The characters are magnificently build, extremely complex and very human, despite the almost unearthly battles they live. You will notice the depth of Jet Li's character, and the young Zhang Ziyi, although not in the center of attention, gives her character a touch of passion. The martial arts featured in this film are an entity. They live through the characters, and they transmit a unique message. There are some elements from ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", but this movie is superior in any way possible. The effects used are ground-shaking. Try to imagine a sky filled with raging arrows, or a battle through falling leaves, that engulf the fighters like a tornado. Pay special attention to the philosophy, for if this film were a book, the philosophical meanings would be waiting on every single page. Many Chinese ideas and traditions are shown here, in a unique manor. Finally, the music is perfect for portraying all of the above. It flows through your mind and body while you see this film, and you can envisage every note, every sound, while focusing on the many jumps, attacks and counter-attacks. I recommend this work of art to all martial arts-action-drama lovers, but I think its message will strike deep in everybody's hearts, no matter the preferences, age or general views.",Hero
310,darthheimdall,"All style, no substance",1,11 July 2007,"I heard good things about this movie so I stayed up to watch it when it came on TV at 3 a.m. The visuals were stunning, and the action sequences (especially the ""mind battle"" between Nameless and Sky in one plot) were fantastic.However, from a plot perspective, this movie is terrible. First we get one plot of how Nameless killed the three assassins, which is false, then another detailing what the Emperor thinks happened, which is false, and it just kept going until I didn't care anymore. And why did Broken Sword get stabbed in every single plot? And I still don't understand why Nameless didn't kill the Emperor. If the cryptic ""Our Land"" message was supposed to be the reason, it simply wasn't good enough. I don't see why a man who had his province oppressed would kept from killing a tyrant for the sake of unifying with other provinces he's probably never seen, much less cares about. This is more proof that the critics, who have overwhelmingly lauded this movie, are out of their minds.",Hero
311,kainaw,Ying Xiong (Hero) is a masterpiece,10,7 September 2004,"Most people are quick to compare Ying Xiong (Hero) to Wo Hu Cang Long (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon). They are both in the same genre, but entirely different movies.While it is important to note that both films are masterpieces of cinematic opera, Wo Hu Cang Long is a throwback to the classic action epics of early Chinese films, similar to the swashbuckling films out of Hollywood. It makes no apologies for the silliness of the early films, including flying swordfighters. Ying Xiong is more of a play on those films and the stories that inspired them.Jet Li plays a nameless assassin who offers the King of Qin the weapons of his three greatest enemies. In doing so, he tells a fanciful tale of how he defeated them with both his sword and his mind. Following this, the King explains what he believes took place. It is a tale of deceit aimed at getting the assassin in place to kill the King. Their stories are enacted on screen through a feast of color and sound.Knowing a touch of Chinese history, it is clear that the King of Qin cannot be killed. He unites all of China under one ruler. Like watching Titanic while knowing that it would sink in the end, it is still captivating to see how the nameless assassin will react as the King uncovers his secret motive.It is also important to note that all of the fanciful swordplay and flying takes place in the stories told by the assassin and the King, not in the parts of the film intended to be on a real world foundation. For those who were turned off by the unrealistic stunts in Wo Hu Cang Long, it is easy to accept the same actions in Ying Xiong.",Hero

As in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" the characters here fly through the air and dance across water, but ""Crouching Tiger"" surely could have benefited from the sublime camera eye of ""Hero."" One scene of swordplay in particular that takes place in a grove of trees amongst swirling yellow leaves almost stopped my heart in my chest: It was that gorgeous. And yes, there is a plot also, one that involves various assassins with names like Sky, and Broken Sword, and Flying Snow. I have to admit that the tales and counter-tales told were a bit confusing at first, but by the time the film is over, all the pieces have fallen into place, and this chapter of ancient Chinese history has assumed a truly mythical quality.

Please, don't expect a story out of 'Hero', but a spirit and meaning. The soul of a 'Hero' is sacrificing your heart, your love, your dreams, and your revenge.Yet, 'Hero' is still enjoyable as a kungfu flick. From all the cast, Jet Li and Donnie Yen are the real martial dancers, so director Zhang Yimou entrust the first duel scene to them. Under the choreography of veteran actor and kungfu visionary Tony Ching, the first duel - rendered in black with brown accent in Yen's costum - is fast, furious and fabulous.Other masterpiece scene includes the blue lake that stays calm after every movement of two assasins: Jet Li and Tony Leung. With a natural lighting, the serene lake reflects the beauty of love between Leung and his lover Maggie Cheung.Compared to his fellow choreographer Yuen Wo Ping, Tony Ching uses another approach to kungfu. His movements are more imaginative and wild. Enjoy Maggie Cheung creating a twister of falling leaves with her mighty sword, and Jet Li running faster than the waterdrops.Tan Dun's music is excellent, supported by Japanese drummer KODO and violist Itzhak Perlman. Wong Kar Wai's cinematographer buddy Christopher Doyle works to the limit of excellence.To no doubt, 'Hero' is a heroic masterpiece!",Hero
316,nycsean,Fantastic- didn't let me down,9,13 January 2004,"First, let me say that I have been dying to see this film. The combination of Jet Li, Zhang Yimou (Director) and Christopher Doyle (Cinematographer)gave it a superstar billing both in front and behind the screen. The additions of Maggie Cheung, Tony Leung, Donnie Yen and Zhang Ziyi just heightened it.Within 20 minutes, the film had already surpassed my expectations. Yimou is never a dull director, and he reconstructed heroism. Other reviews compare this film to Kill Bil and Rush Hour. INHO- that's a disservice, those films are parodies of a genre (or classic western appropriation).The other film it bears comparison to is Crouching Tiger, but it is better in several ways. First, to get ti out of the way, the fight scenes. Second, and much more important, the film is cerebral, with it's intellectualism supported in the fights and colors. The film explores individual action in the context of a society, and like Rashomon before it, breaks each story into an individual context. It completes the Postmodern context, resetting back into the overall repurcussions (something the Deconstructionists have yet to rectify).Each protoganists story is told differently, in different colors. The colors are left up to us to interpret. Red- perhaps revenge. Green, innocence and youth.Each heroe's stoy is also a different role. Jet Li starts as a character seeking personal vengeance but begins to think it terms of the greater the good. Tony Leung also makes this transition, at an earlier stage. His lover, Maggie Cheung, holds on to her motive of revenge and pays a price (I am being a little vague so as not to give it away), her emotional path effectively boomering back on her.How far should the hero in persuing the personal cause? How far in the political? What actions are permissible in either realm? ANd what is the greater good?

How many times can I watch these overly dramatic scenes where people are looking off in opposite directions talking to each other?

Yes, the cinematography is gorgeous, but that alone is not enough, and only raises it from a zero to a three(out of ten) on my scale. The message -- China must be united whatever the personal cost to those on the Chinese periphery (look out Taiwan! bye-bye Hong Kong!) is tired and worn-out and, well, do we really want a message in such a film? Clearly Zhang Yimou is working hard to ingratiate himself to the Party censors, but that doesn't mean his audience needs to fawn over such sycophancy, as I fear so many in outside of China have.

This is where the story takes place with flashbacks telling the events that have lead to this point. There are three different perspectives that are told and the twists in them will throw you for a loop.As much as I love this movie that is the one drawback. The different perspectives hinder us from understanding the characters because we learn something different in each perspective. The two characters that are developed the best are Broken Sword and Snow and the way the are developed is well worth it and allows the audience to forgive the no development of Sky or the little development on our ""Nameless"" hero.The scenes are beautiful and this movie you can watch without the subtitles and still enjoy because the scenes and fights are absolutely stunning.This is an amazing movie and I highly recommend it.",Hero

I only say 'American' fans because he has created a big action orientated following in the US with films such as 'Kiss of the Dragon' and ""Cradle to the Grave' etc. Having said that though, even fans of his HK exploits may be disappointed too. This is no 'Tai Chi Master' or 'Once Upon a Time in China' for example.Jet is indeed 'restrained' in this film, as are ALL the players. This movie is not about crazy, OTT action scenes. It will NOT deliver for hardcore kung fu fans. It's not supposed too though, that's the point. This is a film that is amazingly stylish that plays on drama rather than action. Even though you can watch the stunningly beautiful Maggie Cheung 'duce it out' with 'ol Jet it all comes across as style over substance way too often. I think that the American advertisements are a tad misleading in the fact you're going to see see a swordsmen's epic, and besides a exciting fight involving Jet and Donnie Yen, you won't really, but fans of HK cinema must still see this movie. It has a disappointing ending for sure and it really doesn't provide what it promises. It's a great film, unfortunately, it isn't as brilliant as some (including myself) would have hoped for. It's style over substance is basically it's downfall.It's comparsion to 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' is unfounded in my opinion. Although it is enjoyable for film lovers out there, it doesn't really come close to the quality of CTHD and audiences will definitely see that.

321,film_am_03,Excellently shot but a very disappointing ending ...,7,14 January 2005,"WARNING: Major spoilersI thoroughly enjoyed this movie, until the last 10 or so minutes, which left me just as deeply disappointed. Believe me, I don't necessarily hate films with tragic ending, but there has to be a purpose for it. I saw no justification in the movie for the ending that it has, and in *this* aspect, the movie is indeed similar to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (where I believe there was absolutely no reason for Chow Yun-Fat's Li Mu Bai character to die).*** Spoiler-free zone (well, almost) ***The movie is vivid and stylish, with emphasis on images to convey the story. The dialog is minimal. There are excellently and surreally choreographed and photographed martial arts sequences.The story is this: The King of Qin dynasty in China wants to unite all the warring kingdoms in China under one rule for the sake of lasting peace in the land. For this sake, he wages war on all other kingdoms and these wars cause great deal of destruction. Four great warriors, who are great masters of amazing martial arts (and therefore in essence, the masters of the great arts and knowledge in the country) are pained by the bloodshed and want to assassinate the king, even though the fourth one is not a known assassin. (Each of them is shown to have a personal motive to assassinate the king, even though at least two of them talk at a level much higher than mere vendetta - about philosophy, sacrifice, greater good et al.) The king himself is no slouch even if he's not as great a warrior as them. He builds almost impregnable barriers to protect himself. So the fourth warrior, called Nameless (played by Jet Li), kills the other three, and as a reward gets an audience with the king and therefore a chance to assassinate him. The biggest plot twist is the argument of one of the other three warriors, Broken Sword, who is farsighted enough to see the merit in the king's wars. The question then is this: has he managed to convince Nameless to stop his assassination plans?*** MAJOR SPOILERS *** (I'm revealing the end.)Nameless finally sees the wisdom behind the king's wars and does not assassinate the king when he gets a chance. But what was the reason for Nameless, Flying Snow, and Broken Sword to kill themselves in the denouement? What happened to Sky? Did he die too? I was not quite clear on that. In any case, these four warriors are shown to be above and beyond all the others. If they live, they will at least be able to transmit the priceless knowledge to others. If it is not their personal right to openly support the king's endeavor, let them 'retire' and disappear. What is the reason for them to ""sacrifice"" themselves? I can only think of one: contrivance. It makes the movie tragic. But it also makes the movie contrived.For 80-85 minutes, the director Yimou Zhang gives us a wonderfully meditative and artistically breathtaking movie. But in the last 10-15 minutes, he seriously missteps. The movie, as a whole, is good but falls short of the greatness it could have achieved.",Hero

On the other hand, what isn't recycled after 10000 years of our attempts to civilization, so I just shut up.Once, only once the movie made me wanna say ""oh, boy, why in the world would you need THAT?!"", it was at the end of the movie.You remember those awkward moments when while visiting a foreign country you're invited to see a local school children choir singing for you in your language a typical folk song from your country, which they make sound like a message from an alien civilization to the Supreme Council of Guinean tree frogs, and everyone's smiling their teeth out and looking for traces of approval in your face, and you're ready to harakiri yourself with a ladle just to escape this realm of overpowering cutesy that looks feels and sounds like a baby shower at Sailor Moon's?OK, so that's how I felt while watching this final scene. Gosh, why make it THAT obvious?... First I just frowned in disgust and thought that I didn't need it at all, I'm enough interested in Oriental culture to not need it at all. Then I thought that maybe there's lots of Western people who in fact need this as a message of intercultural communication (aliens and tree frogs?) or whatever it was...

Personally, I have seen Crouching tiger, and that's about the size of it, so I can genuinely say that this film came as a real shock to me in almost every aspect! The most obvious thing about the film is the way in which it is shot. The scenes themselves are astonishingly beautiful, deeply affecting and (I would guess) just as important as the action that they contain. The scenes engaged me in the same way that great art engages. I wanted to keep looking at them, enjoying the visual perfection.Against this perfect background the fight scenes are dreamlike, and beautifully choreographed. They highlight the fantastic art of the fighters, and reinforce the link between the understanding of form in combat, and form in calligraphy or art.The simple, beautiful nature of the combat, the colours, the scenes, and even the names of the assassins serve to underline the simplicity of the story, and reinforce its powerful (if controversial) message. The assassin becomes a hero by understanding that the creation of 'Our Land' is superior to his own revenge, and the chaos that would be created by that revenge.The conclusion that the greater good of society should supersede the individual's selfish goals probably has more resonance in China than it does in the West, but the point is made powerfully, but above all, beautifully made.Well worth watching!",Hero
324,mariaeleni_pntz,Tyranny can not and should not be justified.,1,29 June 2018,"To give your life for a greater good is one thing. To give your life for a violent tyrant with delusions of grandeur is another. As noble as the idea ""One under the sky"" may be, it all depends on who unites the people and how. Because that was also Hitler's ideal, to create one big empire, never mind human casualties. Can we still justify the loss of even just one human soul as ""necessary for the greater good"" ? Can we still accept the barbaric idea that human souls are dispensable for the good of the cause ? And who defines the righteousness of the cause? These were cruel and savage times but we're supposed to understand better now. There is nothing truly wise or ethical or humble about the King of Qin, not even in the film. All he's after is power, as so many conquerers before him. He says at some point in this film that he does not intend to stop with China, his ultimate goal is to conquer the Earth. Just another megalomaniac , drunk with power, who justified his viciousness and lust for glory with a noble lie - we've seen so many of them in human history. I went through a few reviews and I only found one that pointed out the obvious and clarified a few things. It is indeed shocking that so many viewers cared only for the spectacular effects and the beauty in the scenes and did not even care to examine the message of the film a little deeper. I thank the user by the name ""potteries"" for pointing out that : ""the dynasty the king founded collapsed rapidly after his death as a result of the hatred for his regime"". Of course it collapsed. Such regimes are unstable by nature. Tyrannies always collapse. The goal to ""unify the people"" can never be reached through tyranny. That's why democracy and human rights were invented.",Hero
325,chmilar,"Jet Li's best, but not Zhang Yimou's best",8,19 April 2004,"Having gotten sick of waiting for this film to be released in the U.S., I purchased it on import DVD.The producers of Hero obviously want to cash in on the success of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Hero has a number of traits that are similar to CTHD: a cello and drums score, with similar musical themes; awesomely beautiful locations; a fictional story set within historical China; interesting martial arts fight scenes, assisted with wire-fu.That said, Hero stands on its own as a film, and the common elements with CTHD are mostly superficial.Hero is action star Jet Li's best film, so far.Director Zhang Yimou has made many truly excellent films, including ""Raise the Red Lantern"", ""The Story of Qiu Ju"", ""Keep Cool"", ""Shanghai Triad"", ""To Live"", and so on. When ranking Zhang's films, I have to put Hero at the bottom of an impressive list (although I have not seen ""Codename Cougar"").Judging on visual style, it is Zhang's best. It is simply beautiful. Many sequences are monochromatic, or monochromatic with one accent color. Zhang even chooses landscapes to match his color schemes - an impressive feat (although some locations, such as the Li River near Yangshuo, have been enhanced - either digitally or through split-grade filters - to achieve the monochrome effect). Zhang was even granted permission to film at the UNESCO World Heritage site, Jiuzaigou (Nine Village Valley), with its unusual blue lakes. Cinematographer Christopher Doyle also deserves credit for the stunning visuals.Hero has a clever and interesting story line, where we revisit the same events and characters multiple times, each time with a new piece of information which completely changes our interpretation of what happened, and the motivation and goals of each character.However, while CTHD has a strong emotional core, Hero does not. The film has a distant, intellectual feel. Zhang's strength, in his previous films, is in telling intimate stories of people, even if the setting has epic proportions. In Hero, he attempts to tell a grander story, with large, heroic characters, and fails. The characters remain distant and cool, like pieces in a chess game.The performance of Maggie Cheung, as Flying Snow, is the strongest. Cheung is one of the most expressive and emotionally true actresses working today. She manages to breathe a lot of life into a thinly drawn character.Flying Snow's partner/lover, Broken Sword, is well played by the always enjoyable Leung Chiu-Wai. As with Cheung, he manages to put some life into his character, but has little opportunity to do so. Unfortunately, the role does not permit Leung to use his smooth charm and intellect.Zhang Ziyi gets the worst of the deal. Her character, Moon, is a stale stereotype which gives her no room at all to breathe, strangling her performance. This is sad when compared to her wonderful performance in Zhang Yimou's earlier film, The Road Home.Jet Li is not known for his acting prowess. His character - the central role in Hero - is a loner/assassin type, and plays well to his strengths and weaknesses as an actor. He turns in a career-best performance, adding some roguish charm to an otherwise mostly physical performance (at which Li always excels).Hero is worth watching as a visual statement, and for its intriguing, twisting storyline. It is unfortunate that equal time was not devoted to developing strong characters, to give an emotional core to the film. As with some other recent large budget, epic, and ambitious films from China (The Emperor and the Assassin, Musa), too much time was spent on grandeur (of story, scenery, sets, and costumes) and not enough on the basics of character and emotional interest. Ang Lee has shown the path, but other directors are having difficulty following it.",Hero
326,exeter-10,Beautiful in so many ways,10,1 November 2003,"I bought the DVD for HERO as an import from Hong Kong, not knowing what to expect. I had heard several recommendations that the scenery and visuals were gorgeous, but that's about it. I was surprised to find that it actually had a very interesting and engrossing plot as well. The acting was well done, particularly in the portrayals of Flying Snow, Broken Sword, and his servant Moon. The artistic nature of the film is in the vein of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (though don't bother comparing the two beyond that, they're completely different entities other than fighting style, which was a different enough concept here to be original), and literally every camera shot and scene is breathtaking. The unsung heroes of this film are really the cinematography team. There is not a single scene where I didn't marvel at the visuals, or commend those behind the film for creating something original and stimulating. At first I thought the plot was simple, until I got further into it and realized that it was much more complex than I imagined. The storytelling is almost a nod to Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"", changing the nature of the story through different perspectives in flashbacks. Yes, Jet Li's ""Nameless"" character was a tad one-dimensional, but in the context of the film, he's *supposed* to be. You end up feeling less for him, and more for the characters that surround him, but I believe that's the entire point of the film; the concept that the character was only as deep as his mission at the start, and how the events that occur within the story lead to changing him at the end. The same could be said for the plot, which is deceptively more than it appears to be at first.I would fully support a North American release of this film, as I think it's the kind of movie that deserves to be seen by a wider audience.",Hero
327,Kallanta,Simply stunning. A genuine masterpiece.,9,16 September 2004,"When sitting down to watch 'Hero', the Quentin Tarrintino presented, Yimou Zhang directed martial arts epic, there are a few things you should know: First, it is in Chinese. If that's a problem for you then the second part might even more so: it is a movie heavily steeped in Chinese and oriental culture. Third, this is not in any way, shape, or form a typical kung-fu movie-it is far more philosophical and meaningful than even Ang Lee's 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. In short, this movie puts the art back into the concept of martial arts.In 200 B.C., China was split into seven kingdoms. The ruler of the kingdom of Qin (played with gusto by Daoming Chen) sought to unify China into one nation, but attempts on his life from the neighboring kingdom of Zhao have left him paranoid and afraid that he will be unable to fulfill his dream. Zhao seeks to stop the King using its three top assassins, Long Sky (Donnie Yen), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung), and Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chui Wai), who each have attempted to kill the King in the past. In enters Nameless (Jet Li), a local prefect of Qin, born in Zhao without a name, claiming to have killed all three and seeking an audience with the King to claim his reward. Slowly, Nameless tells the tale of how he outwitted and overcame each of the assassins and through the course of the film, the story's facts change as the King questions details of the tale, exposing more and more of the truth of what did and didn't happen and twisting the plot further and further.The closest movie to compare this to would be Akira Kurosawa's 'Rashamon', which used a similar flashback technique whereby the same story is told through several different perspectives. Unlike the earlier masterpiece however, this movie only uses two storytellers, each asking questions and telling details of their own experiences with the assassins until the truth can be learned. The stories themselves are each filled to the brim with warrior philosophy, long discussions of how art and swordplay are intertwined, love triangles, metaphors, similes and all the other goodies that a deeply layered film exhibits.The photography used throughout the movie is quite simply jaw-dropping. Each flashback and version of the story is told through the use of a different color palette, some in deep green or fiery red or fine yellows, each symbolic in terms of the story and the imagery captured. There are flourishes as well, such as the pink plumes atop the Qin army's helmets or the fiercely yellow candles that sit in front of the King. Each camera angle is carefully considered and composed, lending weight to the editing and acting. This movie looks amazing. In one scene, an endless hail of arrows rains down on a school and Nameless and Flying Snow go outside to deflect arrows while Broken Sword remains inside painting a poster board of calligraphy. Somehow, amidst this black rain of wood, in a time of war and turmoil, is a man whose only concern is finishing a piece of art. This might possibly be the most beautiful film, visually, that I have ever witnessed. The pacing of the film is intentionally slow, but not overly so. It gives the film a very contemplative mood, allowing one to think about what they're seeing more than react to it. This even applies to the many fight scenes in the film. Combat occurs very quickly yet the detail and mood are such that you don't so much hang onto the edge of your seat waiting for the next sword-stroke, but think about the movement and patterns and beauty that the martial arts can be capable of. That isn't to say that the fights are not exciting, merely that they are different from what most have come to expect from a film of this nature.Those who do not like warrior angst are probably not going to get too into the story of the film, since there are long bouts of the leads discussing the nature of what they do, but I found none of it intrusive or overly long.Indeed the only fault I could find in the film is an unintentionally misleading camera shot at the end of the film. Otherwise, this film is as close to perfect as I could hope for.Do not ignore this import. This is a movie that can be seen by a dozen people who each have a dozen different things to say about it. This is a classic in every sense of the word and a landmark in the martial arts genre of movie-making, taking further the strides that Ang Lee took with 'Crouching Tiger'. Simply put, this movie should be seen by everyone regardless of whether or not you are a fan of the genre.4 Stars (out of 4).",Hero
328,dedebee,A 'Hero' to fight for,9,24 January 2005,"In the year 2000, Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" was released in America, and unexpectedly found blockbuster success. Who would have thought a Chinese-language martial arts epic set in ancient times, featuring characters walking across water, flying through the air, and fighting on tree branches would have ever gone on to gross over $125 million in the U.S. alone? Audiences embraced the beauty and magic of the film, and hopefully they will do the same for ""Hero,"" a film that's no less amazing.""Hero"" seems to exist in the same world as ""Crouching Tiger"" does, a world where skilled warriors can battle over a vast sea, with only a slight touch of the water needed to balance them. A world where enemies don't have to fight physically, but can challenge each other simply in their minds. It's also a world where an onslaught of arrows launched by a formidable army can be stopped by the deftness of two swords. If you can't accept this world as believable, or if you can't accept the thought of reading subtitles for a good hour and 45 minutes, then by all means, go see ""Anacondas."" Jet Li escapes his American prison of Joel Silver-produced action movies to star as a nameless warrior in ancient China, determined to protect the ruler of the Qin Dynasty from three master assassinsSky (Donnie Yen), Broken Sword (Tony Leung), and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung). The film unfolds in flashbacks, as the nameless one details to his majesty how he was able to defeat his deadly adversaries. If you think I just ruined the film for you, relaxthere's a lot more to the story than that.What follows is multiple accounts of the same series of events, all involving the aforementioned characters, as well as Moon (Zhang Ziyi), Broken Sword's apprentice. Academy Award nominated director Zhang Yimou and cinematographer Christopher Doyle use different color pallets to differentiate each version, including lush hues of red, blue, green and white. It's tough to put into words just how great ""Hero"" looks on screen. That vision is something that must be experienced firsthand, especially in a gorgeous duel between Cheung and Ziyi, set in an autumn-like environment complete with powerful gusts of wind and vivid red and bright orange leaves.The scenery isn't the only beautiful element of ""Hero."" All the swordplay is spectacular and expertly captured on film by Yimou (""Raise the Red Lantern""), which is surprising, considering his inexperience as an action director. The performers all move with the swiftness and grace of a ballet troupe, albeit a dangerous one, armed with swords and staffs and knives. The acting performances are just as expertly choreographed, proving how adept Yimou is at dramatics. Cheung and Leung stand out the most, thanks to their meaty subplot as rivals and lovers. The duo are incendiary together, setting off fireworks on screen with their radiance and chemistry.The film's only downfall is its pacing, which most likely can be attributed to the script. Since the story is told through flashbacks, it does get repetitive and overlong at times, and the transitions between the past and present become a bit jarring. However, that detail is minor at best, and does not detract from the film's magic. ""Hero"" is an epic accomplishment all around, and it's a mystery why the folks at Miramax have kept it on the shelf for so long (it was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2002 Academy Awards). Comparisons to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" are inevitable and well-deserved. Hopefully ""Hero"" will be able to find the audience it deserves, just as ""Crouching Tiger"" did.",Hero

This film is a painting - with composition so classical and stunning that i kept forgetting to read the subtitles and having to rewind. Zhang Yimou, words cannot say, he knows how to stage a scene. This film is otherworldly in its imagery, something that works for this particular narrative, which takes place mostly in fantastic sequences of recollection rather than reality. In turn, the dominant color of each sequence identifies and emboldens the differences between each of these alternating perspectives. And in the end, Tarantino-esque, these swirling pieces of memory coalesce as the narrative of a single conversation between two main characters, the king and his assassin. I gave it a rousing eight stars because, as an audience, we are engrossed and captivated by the audacity of the cinematic effort, and we can understand the meaning of the film in the application of this visual artistry. The reason i gave it only eight stars is because i think that the film is academic in the sense that i never identified with the characters on an emotional level. The themes come together, but more in the mind and less in the heart.

I believe this was, in part, due to the fact that I was too consumed with the cinematography and design, both are overwelmingly beautiful! Seriously, I would love to make posters of the frame grabs. The story, acting, directing (to some extent), and emotion was lost on me. This was before purchasing the DVD last night and watching it for a second time.While watching it a second time, I was able to be completely drawn in to the film as a whole. It was great. The story is consistently flipping, the acting is deep, direction was great in every aspect, and the emotions were there as I became entranced. This is definitely a movie to watch twice or more. Once for the eye candy, probably the strongest ingredient of the picture, and then sit back and revisit it letting yourself take it all in with out as narrow a focus.It definitely deserves a 9. It is truly excellent. The production value is far above average, possibly deserving of a 10, a 9.5 without question. The story is hearty, like a novel, you feel like you have invested your time in something worthy. The acting was award winning, wraught with depth so that you believe that they feel exactly the way they are telling you that they feel. Never once do you question their emotions, definte 9!

However, this movie impressed me a lot. I've watched this movie in school for film class. At first, I was not expecting anything because I didn't really like Chinese movie.

337,djhenebury-1,a tribute to all the colors of the rainbow,10,14 December 2005,"I must agree with one of the other comments i read about this movie that you have to watch this movie at least twice before you judge it. The best aspects of the movie according to me are: the actors, the colors, the triple story-telling.The actors: Offcourse Jet Li is a well-known fighting actor. Apart from fighting this movie shows some of his other talents. Donnie Yen isn't exactly well-known, at least he wasn't until this movie. And so this movie was a good opportunity for him to show us what he is made of and he did so by also performing brilliantly. This also counts for Maggie Cheung and Ziyi Zhang, although Ziyi had already shown his skills in the equally brilliant movie ""Crouching tiger, hidden dragon""The Colors: Zhang Yimou uses the power of color to strengthen the story and to make the battles look more intense. A great scene in the movie is when ""Flying Snow""(Maggie Cheung) and ""Nameless""(Jet Li) fight against incoming arrows of the king's archers on top of a building. And after that when ""Moon""(Ziyi Zhang) seeks revenge for the killing of her lover ""Sky""(Donnie Yen) by ""Flying Snow"".

Before it made it to American theaters, It was a smash hit in China and has already garnered a Best Foreign language Oscar nomination. I can say with absolute certainty that ""Hero"" is one of the most aesthetic films ever made. You'd be hard pressed to find a movie more visually breathtaking than this one. Every single frame of this film is like a Van Gogh painting. It simply has to be seen to be believed.As a life-long martial-arts film enthusiast, I expected more in terms of entertainment but found the film a bit on the slow side. I'm not gainsaying that fact that the film was very well-made, I just wasn't very entertained by it. The story could've been a bit better. It was a bit too simplistic and prosaic for my liking. There isn't much to this film plot-wise. The fight sequences were a bit of a letdown for me. I prefer the fast and furious type of martial-arts fight sequences as opposed to the Peter Panesque, slow-mo ballet dance.There were certainly several moments of sheer brilliance in the film, and for that reason, I'm recommending it. The performances are impressive. Jet Li isn't exactly a great dramatic actor but he's effective here. The beautiful acclaimed actress, Maggie Cheung, never fails to impress. She shines as ""Flying Snow"". Zhang Ziyi is wonderfully understated as ""Moon"". Tony Leung Chiu Wai, who appeared in Kar Wai Wong's masterpiece, ""In The Mood For Love"", with Maggie Cheung, also makes his presence felt. Donnie Yen, an accomplished martial-artist, had such infinitesimal screen time, much to my chagrin. I was hoping he had more fight sequences featuring him and Li.In the final analysis, this is a very good film, but it isn't the masterpiece ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" was.",Hero

American movies often try and sell the idea of Democracy to the rest of the world. Now I am not anti-democracy, but these movies still brainwash. A lot of the people that make the comments on brainwashing only see them, because they come from another society and mentality. To a chinese the idea of falling in line with the West or a war in order to prevent the spread of Communism (e.g. Vietnam, Korea, Angola etc, etc) might seem brainwashing.

Personally, due to its overly rating and high critics opinion, I had really high expectations from this movie but in reality, there is nothing other than martial arts with exceptional camera actions. People flying like jets, fighting over water etc were some of the un-realistic scenes which lets you think that may be its bit too much. Movie starts with a confrontation between king and the nameless warrior (Jet Li) and there starts different stories about how the warrior was able to fight his enemies who turns out to be actually his allies in the mission of killing the ruthless king. This is one of the worst scripts I have seen. In that respect, I consider Jackie Chan's movies as much better than what Hero is, at least the guy does his own stunts and they are entertaining at least. After you see Hero, you keep thinking that did you really expect what you saw? May be not. If the Broken Sword really had the idea of not killing the king from the last time they attempted the attack on king, why did he keep quiet for so long until Jet Li and team had already prepared for the next attack? Isn't it ridiculous? Why did Broken Sword's girlfriend had to kill him? And why did he draw the sword at her to make her believe that he loves her? I mean if he is so big supporter of peace then why the heck he let the drama happen? Anyway, script-wise, this movie has so many flaws that you would simply like to leave your brain out of the theater when you see this movie.my rating: I would give it 4 but because it is overrate, I am giving it 0 to balance the overratings.",Hero
347,nytemare,9/10 - Cinematography at its finest,8,1 November 2004,"Review: A movie filled with great use of colour scheme and background makes for a beautiful movie. The story itself is quite long-winded and feels a bit 'slapped together'. Overacting works well in this movie because it emphasizes the behaviour of each character (the strong voice of a king, the neutral voice of 'the unnamed warrior', the calm natured voice of Leung Chi Wai). The cinematography is at its FINEST, there is no other equal (unless you include IMAX films). The landscaping shots however include a very ominous musical score that tends to make me go to sleep (not literally sleep but contemplating it). Scratch off 1 point for the undeniably long scenery shots.9/10 - Cinematography at its finest",Hero
348,RCBP_Collection,`Hero' fails to deliver on almost every level that really matters,1,2 December 2003,"It is impossible to avoid comparing Zhang Yimou's `Hero' to Ang Lee's `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.'  They were both big-budget Chinese kung-fu films with breathtaking cinematography of Chinese landscape and a cast of super-stars. But aside from the obvious, there is in fact nothing else to compare. `Hero' fails to deliver on almost every level that really matters, proving that big-name stars, beautiful scenery, and action effects are no replacement for a director's artistry and vision.All the marketing hype preceding the premier of `Hero' has done nothing more than make its failure a spectacular one.  Much anticipated, `Hero' drew movie-goers in throngs when it first opened at theaters in mainland China and Hong Kong, making it an instant box-office success. However, though the script pleased government censors, Chinese audiences went to newfound heights of caustic criticism and sarcastic wit to express their disdain. On-line critics, both professional and amateur, proclaimed the film `ideologically disturbing,' `from the viewpoint of deep servitude,' written `either by an amateur historian, or someone with ulterior motives.' One article was simply titled, `Hero, you make me sick!'The deepest failing of the film is in its plot, which is not only morally reprehensible, and based on unforgivable historic fallacy but - worst of all for a film - is boring! All blockbuster epic films are known to take some liberties with the facts of history, but `Hero' goes beyond artistic license into unforgivable ignorance when it attempts to glorify an emperor that was as brutal as Stalin or Hitler. `Hero' does not make up for this lack of moral compass by being entertaining or fun.  Instead, it is makes a woefully poor attempt at being `deep' and merely manages to be pretentious and preachy.Though historians agree that the First Emperor of China was ruthlessly violent, Mao Zedong was known to have admired this ruler - no surprise, given Mao's own tyrannical rule.  Likewise, the Communist government in Beijing sees the allegory that can easily be drawn between the First Emperor and its own iron-fist methods, so they were particularly pleased with this latest work by Zhang Yimou. Tony Leung, one of the stars of `Hero' remarked during an interview to promote the film that the Beijing government had done the right thing in 1989 by crushing the student demonstrations, because it was needed to maintain `stability' in China.  For these remarks, Tony Leung received shocked criticisms in his home city of Hong Kong, but he merely stated out loud the underlying message of the movie.Director Zhang Yimou has stated that his goal was to surpass the values of loyalty and revenge that are traditional in kung-fu novels and movies, to reveal a higher wisdom. Unfortunately, his version of `wisdom' turns out to be: THE OPPRESSOR IS RIGHT. In China, where thousands of years of historical reality have rammed this message through, art was the last sanctuary where the individual could actually find freedom from such tyranny. The great popularity of the kung-fu novel can be explained by its ability to provide an escape into an alternate world: one where kung-fu warriors roamed the country seeking adventure and fighting for justice, free from fear and winning against all odds with their super-human skills. Only in the novel did the individual ever win over institutionalized power in China, and only in the novel did the oppressed find their champions. Going against this tradition of the kung-fu hero, Zhang Yimou has not gone upwards towards a higher truth, as he had hoped, but downwards, to the level of government propaganda.  It's no wonder the government was so pleased.Some film lovers may secretly wonder, `All moralistic judgments aside, is it at least entertaining?'  Fortunately, the answer is a resounding `No!' Because the same tale is told over and over with only slight variations, it becomes tedious to watch. Moreover, the three conflicting versions of the same story serves only to confuse the character development, since it leaves precious little time for the viewer to feel any sympathy for any of them once the `real' version emerges.The film is not without its beautiful images. However, all the scenes fall flat because they do not connect to or enhance the storyline. The use of different colors to distinguish the separate versions of the tale comes across as simplistic and contrived, and the cinematography appears self-consciously rather than truly beautiful. Great for a trailer, but a disappointment once you are there to watch the entire film.For those in China who showed disdain for `Crouching Tiger's' unrealistic kung-fu, much was expected from `Hero.' Jet Li, who plays the title role, is a real kung-fu artist who held national titles before beginning his career as an actor.  His previous movies have revealed limited acting abilities, but many hoped that Zhang Yimou could use Li's lithe body movements to full effect while casting him properly in a role that would not task his acting abilities.  But it was not to be. `Hero' attempts to go beyond the kung-fu genre, so there are not many fighting scenes, and Jet Li is expected to perform a difficult piece of acting: an inner transformation leading to profound wisdom and self-sacrifice. As the casting director ought to have expected, Li fails miserably. Meanwhile, the only fighting scene that reveals any true kung-fu skill is the first one of the film, between Li and and Donnie Yen.  All the scenes that follow are a disappointment, so `Hero' fails to satisfy, even on that level.Though most audiences outside China are unlikely to be aware of the historical mangling of the story of the cruel First Emperor, it seems even more unlikely that they would accept Zhang's version of `Chinese wisdom,' which is anything but. Perhaps the only time an audience coming out of a screening of `Hero' was seen smiling - instead of yawning or frowning - was at the special screening for Chinese government officials.",Hero

350,fregert-1,Beautiful but boring,2,10 December 2005,"This is an obvious attempt to ride on the wave of success that followed ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", and to cash in on the interest for this type of movies. However, ""Hero"" has none of the qualities that made ""Crouching Tiger..."" such a fantastic, joyful masterpiece. Sure, there are tons of beauty - it seems that they consciously picked some of the most beautiful Asian actors around - and lots of action. The problem is that all the visual goodies and effects etc in ""Hero"" - however beautiful, stunning and impressive - has none of the substance, depth and relevance of ""Crouching Tiger..."". It's beautiful but boring. As for the story/plot in ""Hero""... It's so thin that I can't even describe it without giving too much away. Just a poor excuse to make a rip-off of ""Crouching Tiger..."", which actually has a pretty good story/plot. The action scenes in ""Hero"" and the martial arts-techniques are also similar to those in ""Crouching Tiger..."", but in ""Hero"" they are just too mechanical, cold and ""perfect"". It's like comparing a supermodel to a stunning, warm, natural beauty. In this scenario, ""Hero"" is the supermodel. Furthermore, ""Hero"" lacks all the humor, wit, warmth and genuine emotion that ""Crouching Tiger..."" is full of. Yes, there are plenty of tears, heartbreak, sorrow and screaming in ""Hero"", but it's way too staged. Too much slow motion, close-ups, vacant/stiff facial expressions... like a piece of art that everyone is supposed to like because...why? Whatever. Because of all the work? The flawless technique? The perfection? The details? It's just not enough. No substance, no feeling, nothing genuine, nothing or no one to sympathize with. It doesn't work. All the slow motion sequences, close-ups and stills are probably meant to create a sense of sincerity or something, but it's just annoying. It all amounts to some kind of cinematographic pornography: a visual firework display with thought-out combinations for its own sake, to be impressive and breathtaking, but it doesn't mean anything. It's a hollow shell - a meaningless facade. ""Hero"" ain't got nothing on ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".",Hero
351,carlacryptic,Chinese history and legend made real in imagery and action,9,27 September 2004,"I enjoyed Hero (Ying xiong) on many levels, first and foremost as a lover of cinema, for it is a work of visual and kinetic art. The cinematography, art direction, costumes, and music all set the stage beautifully for the actors to bring these legendary characters to life. Zhang Yimou's directorial touch was felt in every exquisite camera angle and saturated color. The movement of objects and people, the juxtaposition of events and viewpoints, was brilliantly done. I still see imagery and lengthy snippets of the action in my mind's eye when I least expect it and I am drawn to the imagery again and again.As a former student of Chinese language and culture who has lived in Asia, I also enjoyed seeing many things I'd only read about brought vividly to the screen. The tea house in which No Name and Sky fight their duel, the old man playing the Zheng on his lap, the music and the remembered duel in the two warriors' minds, all of that brought my time in Hong Kong and Taiwan back to me - not because modern HK and Taiwan are like that at all, but because living in a Chinese environment (if you are immersed in the language and culture) means sharing the present with the past, reality with legend, and living people with ghosts. These things are an integral and tangible part of everyday life. The calligraphy school brought back my years of studying and practicing 'grass writing' and took me to the core of the reasons behind it visually and emotionally in the scenes set there.As a student of internal martial arts, the film put into visible form the essence of their motivation. The stillness, the concentration, the philosophy melded inseparably to the act. The meditation, thought and movement as one. It was thrillingly done.As a woman, it was good to see women and men in lead roles dealing with similar levels of conflict, both internal and external. The only thing I would have done differently would have been to have one woman at least 'get' the holistic concept, one nation out of many. It seems unlikely that women would be less able to grasp the concept than the men. But, that is a small criticism.I will try to see it again on the big screen and will definitely buy it on DVD when it's available. I think it's a film which will bear repeated viewing.",Hero

353,DavidJM,Spectacular cinema,10,19 September 2004,"I think I spoiled it: it's a great film. The technical stuff first: cinematography and sound were impressive, detailed, and creative. Occasionally it became a metaphor for an heraldic time with myth and fable, and the unreal. I guess I have succumbed to the flying as a regular detail of this genre.The movie picks up some time after the ""Emperor and the Assassin"", and characterizes the emperor as a visionary and ignores the barbarism of the time. Perhaps the accuracy is regained toward the end of the movie. The twists and turns keep you guessing in an imaginative way and make it challenging to follow. The ""Mandate from Heaven"" takes a back seat to people debating the best path for history to come. Should the vengeance of the loser yield to a better future?I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. On another perspective, I've been studying Chinese for nearly three years, and the dialog was fascinating in Chinese (at least the parts I could get). I would see again; I will buy the DVD when it comes out, and it's worth being seen by younger members of the family.

Marital arts films are known for not having an entirely intelligible plot, but most of them also don't take themselves this seriously or set up three or four different endings that more or less resolve themselves in the same way.Consider this one Crouching Kitty, Hidden Lizard.

356,annam_s,Wonderful set of postcards from China,1,26 May 2003,"To make it clear - i'm a regular moviegoer. I'm not a fan of the genre (martial arts). I didn't study Chinese philosophy. Sorry. I just like to watch movies. Of all kinds.I saw CTHD (well, everyone mentioned it already) long before it's USA release. I was wowed in some parts, bored to death in others, but overall entertained. I laughed upon hearing it was declared to be a masterpiece, but... whatever floats your boat, folks, really ;).Now back to Hero. I saw the cutted version and honestly, i have no idea what was missing in it. I'm glad i saw only hour and a half - quite frankly, i was bored to death after 20 minutes. Each frame frozen still is a visual masterpiece indeed - the wind is blowing the wonderful (and undoubtly too expensive, too clean, too ironed and ALWAYS bloodless for people on hide, but i digress)clothes of striking colors of every hero. Did i mention it ALWAYS matches the color scheme of the surrounding landscape and cinematography lense? And there's ALWAYS the wind? And the heroes ALWAYS stand in the most photogenic pose? And if they are on the lone sand rock (or whatever it is)it's VERY lone and VERY distant and extremely convenient for the helicopter shoot? And ALL the actors have the strictly-limited range of facial expressions? Except for Jet Li - he has exactly one.I saw these actors in other movies and i know they are far more capable than this.
Another thing - slow-motion. My first impression was that 3/4 of the movie reel consists of slow-mos. It might be exciting for some. For me it was a bit too much. I wanted to be carried away by the fantasy (though this one is based on the historical facts - see the earlier version The Emperor and the Assassin) - instead i've got the set of fascinating soulless stills. I wanted to be entertained - and, very simply put, i wasn't.I know that the critics will go ga-ga over this movie (i think it's 100% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes)and there're more than enough ardent supporters which to every remark i've made will scream with laughter - ""you just don't understand this masterpiece and the philosophy that stands behind it - it's supposed to be that way"".Well, my uneducated mind was sufficient enough for absorbing Rashomon, which Hero resembles, though only in style but not in substance. Maybe Kurosawa pandered too much to us, lower tastes. Or maybe the Oscar glory potential didn't cloud his creative judgement...And by the way... Good movie doesn't change it's cinematic value according to the screen size. My humble opinion, of course.",Hero
357,JollyG87,Not my type of hero!,3,28 August 2004,"Hero tells the story of a martial arts master who defeats the three assassins that want to execute the Emperor.Yes, my friends that is the plot. In the whole 96 minute movie, that is most of the plot. But hey don't worry! The director knows how to stretch a story! All he has to do is copy some stuff from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, put in tons of slow-motion shots, add some sappy romantics to the two dimensional characters, and you got yourself 96 minutes of pure, UNCONTROLLABLE.... boredom. I feel like the critics are just wanting me to see a bad movie. They gave bad reviews to Without a Paddle. It looked good, so I went to see it, and of course, if you look below... you'll see how much I didn't like it. So this week, I was in the spirit of trusting critics, and what did that lead me to see... a movie I liked even less than Without a Paddle. Hero.As you can tell by now, I'm definitely not going to recommend this one; and I have a lot of reasons why I'm not.I'm finally getting tired of movies with slow-motion! I wasn't tired of it on The Matrix trilogy or when any other movies with slow-motion came out, but Hero's the cause of why I no longer like watching it. Every battle in the movie is overextended (kind of reminds me of any DBZ show). Battles last 10 minutes when they could only last two. I was going crazy with all the pointless action stuck in here. I would be like ""Come on, Jet Li! Just kill her quickly instead of going in slow motion!""The thing I really hated was that the movie took itself so seriously, and even worse, they never explain how they could do all these amazing things. When I'm watching a guy running across water with ease, I would like to know why, and the movie never explains it.Hero, like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, tried to pull at your heart strings. And again, like CTHD, it has poorly developed characters. But of course it does, the director is too busy showing off his slow-motion skills. ""Ewww, look... I can make him go slow-motion!"" I guess the director thought he could make Hero a big masterpiece, so he added symbolism and romance in between fight scenes. ""See critics! I put symbolism in this scene, so its not all slow-motion action!""The special-effects were decent overall. Sometimes they were incredible and at other times lousy. Even though there's a really boring scene where Jet Li fights a guy walking on water, the special effects were still amazing. Then there was another scene where Jet Li has to fend off hundreds of arrows, and I couldn't help noticing, ""This looks fake."" But it was pretty damn cool overall.The thing that really stood out in this was the cinematography. The director put in no CGI and some of the shots he got were more amazing than CGI shots in other movies. I'd have to say that this was the only reason I didn't completely detest Hero.Overall, Hero bored me; mostly because of all the excessive slow-motion, poorly developed characters, pointless symbolism, and emotion.

I'd say the story here is even better than Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.2. Good costumes3. Good acting4. They are lucky to be riding on the coat-tails of the Kill Bill series that re-ignited peoples appetites for these types of films. Also, Passion of Christ was in a foreign language and subtitled. So people are more receptive to this type of film now.CONS:1. Sound - not in THX or anything CLOSE... lacked a big theatre feel. The style of music was OK.2. Too unrealistic. e.g. arrows when they were doing calligraphy not hitting anyone. Tired of the running on water sequences. It really takes away from it. Some of the wire work could have been better.3. Mediocre fight scenes. No epic fights. Everything I see here, I have seen in other martial arts films... some done even better. See works of Yuen Wo Ping for excellent fight scenes. (e.g. Yuen Wo Ping was action director for The Matrix.)4. G rating... really took away from its potential content. Needed to be at least PG-13.OTHER:All the actors are solid. Ziyi Zhang (Moon) is a hot cutie. I've seen many of Jet Li's films and I'm afraid this film is too Crouching Tiger to stack up.

This latest take is really little more than flashy CGI, wire fighting and pretty prettiness. Scenes are little more than staging for the scene after it. Slow-motion shots and perfectly-formed tears take the place of emotion. Characters are magically whisked away to the exotic locales in the blink of an eye which robs the film of the scope attained in depicting great journeys. Hair blows in the wind. Gowns blow in the wind. Candelight blows in the wind. Wire sword fight after wire sword fight after wire sword fight. The only interesting part of the plot is the choice to film both sides of the story and even that was lifted from Rashomon.As a piece of visual sequencing, I give it high marks. Sadly, as this is one of maybe two epic Chinese films to ever receive wide American distribution, it will be thought of by many as more than it is. Exotic = better. Look at the pretty fights.

Folks who had talked about ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""House of Flying Daggers"" (both far superior films, by the way) had lauded this movie as though it was the next coming of ""Star Wars.""The plot, what there is to speak of, seems to center around a humble ""prefect"" (which apparently means mind-numbing assassin in the time period in which the movie takes place) who had executed three assassins that had formerly threatened the king. Something that is blatantly obvious from the beginning of the film is the intense ""evil"" of the king, the likability of the assassins, and the intense boredom which is Jet Li -- all of this contributes to the complete ""I don't care"" attitude of the viewer (me). The plot unfolds in flashback style as Jet Li regales the king in what can only have been the worst story ever told. He hunts down the assassins for about five minutes, then fights each of them for about 8 hours. I suppose if you're the kind of person who likes to watch someone else play Street Fighter II for hours, this is your kind of movie.A lot is made of the artistic side of this movie. OK, I admit, there are lots of water droplets, leaves, and guys and gals flying around on cables. In a movie like ""Crouching Tiger..."", you might be inclined to be so drawn into the movie where you don't notice or you may even buy in to it, as we all buy the laser and jet sounds in space in Star Wars. In a movie where you notice these kinds of things-- well, it seems fake and contrived. And they don't look very good, folks-- Especially the scene with the rain of arrows. The billowy cloths were nice though, though I can't say they served some purpose other than to be cool or billowy.Finally, if you manage to survive the intense displeasure of watching the movie in English (as opposed to English subtitles), you'll notice that all of the voice actors seem to have attended the Hayden Christiansen International School of Acting Really Hard. Money well spent, folks.The DVD commentary, if I could write it, would go a little like this: ""Well, I couldn't really come up with a reason to have everyone fight one at a time, so I just had everyone stand around and look real intense like they were fighting with their MINDS! Intense, huh? Then, I had Jet Li mercilessly beat the crap out of somebody backstage to get all of his emotions out of him before he came into the studio.

The acting was above average and I felt like I got to know the characters so there was good development there. The choreography during the fight scenes was OK, and the pace was just right. I am a sucker for romance and it did the job for me. But it's message was so right on if you can translate the motivations of the individuals in the movie to particular nations or groups of people today. For that reason alone, it deserves seeing. It really is a morality play.All in all, I'd give it a 9 out of 10 score.",Hero
367,kingvegeta8,The guy who wrote the other review is a fool.,10,30 July 2003,"You're like my friend who can seem to find humor in anything.""Hero"" tlls the story of an unamed individual who takes it upon himself to stop a tyrranical ruler who aspires to control all China. In the past the three greatest assassins tried and failed to kill the King, but the new Hero seems confident he will succeed where they failed.SPOILERS!!!!!!!All people who see the King must stay 100 paces away(to avoid assassination attempts.) However the King has decreed that anyone who can kill the assassins who tried to kill him will be alowed to move 20 paces closer per dead assassin. In order for Hero to get close enough for the killing blow he must take out the other assassins. This movie is told in flashback, showing how each assassin was defeated. (There is one part where Hero is guarding a school from an army of the King's archers. During this sequence Hero blocks about A HUNDRED THOUSAND arrows!!!) The end is very surprising and the movie is well worth it.",Hero
368,toddaway,Too Much Artsy Slo-Mo,6,8 December 2004,"The director was too full of himself in this one, choosing to focus on trying to dramatize his camera shots by extending them with slo-mo.The whole movie would have been about a half-hour without all the surreal over-dramatic shots. The plot was enjoyable. The fight scenes were OK....spoiled by the wire acts and slo-mo. Definitely not even close to being the movie that Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was. OK, that's my review, but IMDb is forcing me to have 10 lines in order to submit my review. I guess it is quantity they are looking for, not quality. So much for efficient communication. I guess they want superfluous verbage instead.",Hero

370,sangos123,'Music and martial arts have the same principles,10,3 June 2012,"....both grapple with complex chords and melodies' so aptly quoted in the film, nothing can be more truer about Tan Dun's heavenly background score. It transforms an already beautiful movie into something almost divine and ethereal. Using multiple scales to convey a change of scene, moods and settings each composition blends masterfully into each other like a jigsaw piece puzzle to paint a beautiful canvas. If you just close your eyes throughout the movie the music is powerful enough to convey what is going on the screen!Tan Dun uses the minor pentatonic scale with an added 2nd note very characteristic of Chinese traditional music. But surprisingly he uses a very different signature scale - (called Raag Bhairavi of Indian classical music); gives a kind of haunting melancholic melody that runs throughout the movie. The transitioning between scales and melodies is pure musical genius!",Hero
371,noise64,Thank You Miramax...,10,6 September 2003,"Hero, which is gorgeously made by a dream team. Zhang Yimou as Director, Emi Wada as Costume Designer, Christopher Doyle as Cinematographer, Tan Dun as Composer, and a large talented cast.The Story: As incoherent as it goes, it plays with the audiences guilibilty. Left to chose to believe either the Emperor or the man Nameless. This is as close as we can play reality with the film. To leave everything to the audiences' decision. The story is filled with conception of honor, loyalty, and value. We really have to figure out what's right and if it's worth fighting for. The story plays quite well, although due to lack of explanation. The story doesn't quite play through.The Acting: Although I do feel dissapointed that Donnie Yen made the tiniest of cameos, I wish that he would do more for the role. The acting here varies, Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are the scene stealers, they really blew me away. Zhang ZiYi actually is better than she was in CTHD, she delievers a great range of expressions. Jet Li is where the problems starts, although I do think that he's a great fighter. His cold expressions were plain, and I thought that was great at first. But, he played it too cooly. They should have given him more character development. Chen Daoming was perfect for the role of the emporer, he played interestingly in his scenes. His curiousity for the truth and what he thinks what really happens. The acting team is great, but with lack of screen time, it really doesn't help out the characters and the film.The Production: The Production team is the greatest yet! With my all-time favorite DP, Christopher Doyle, he gives my eyes remedies. The lighting, the color, the angles, and the shots. They're all just perfect. The costumes are great, I especially love the white costumes, and the Emporer's Armor. The film score is very moving as well, and its a big improvment from CTHD. The editing is nice, very smooth cuts, and the special effects are great. Although I do think that the Arrow in the Red section was a bit sloppy. It must've been very hard to have millions of arrows shooting towards a building. But, I thought that it looked too fake... I did like the forest fight scene though.The Fight scenes are also great, we get to see a different kind of martial art. Something that hasn't been quite used in a while, there are clean quick movements and smooth graceful movements. It's an actual ballet with swords.The Politics: This is where MY title comes into effect. Now, I do say Miramax has done a great job of releasing Hero in America...Oh wait...they haven't! Wow....Great fighting scenes, great cinematography, great score, great editing, great costumes, great acting, great story, great special effects, and also great direction. What could possibly make Miramax shy this littleBIG film from America? Maybe, Chicago had something to do with it... Maybe Miramax won't get their money's worth when they release it only in some 100 art-house theaters across America. Well, I have so much anger for Miramax's lack of support for this film that I don't want to explain it here. I know that there are millions others that agree with me. Those who are afraid of risking there own, will have already risk losing more. So, When Miramax does eventually end up releasing the film, don't buy into it.  Miramax actually have the guts to ask Zhang Yimou to cut 20 mins of footage that was of Two Hours of film, and this was released worldwide. There is NO International Cut, or Director's Cut. Only, Miramax's Cut, which runs 98 mins. Sucks doesn't it...Maybe that's why the film was a bit less coherent.",Hero
372,thePuppetMaster,This is a Long review! Only read if you are Bore! lol,8,9 January 2003,"I love watching movies, and I can say I enjoyed watching this film. I am not going to say what it has accomplished and what it hasn't yet, but I am going to recommend this film to you if you do love films like me, this is one, which you shouldn't miss out. But like all things, it is not perfect and do contain faults. First, I will explain in my view the mistakes it has made then I will explain what it has that really attracted me to it.The main defect I see in this movie is: it is too commercial; there are some unnecessary characters in there just to boost ratings and ticket sales. Characters like `Like Moon'( Ziyi Zhang) and `long sky'(Donnie Yen) need not to be in it, I have to say Ziyi Zhang is a very beautiful woman and Donnie Yen was really good at his movies but I feel their part in it has no relevance to the story line. It seems to me they shape the movie to merge them into it rather then their present to shape the movie. There are also a lot of unnecessary fighting sequence just to make it all COOL. All of which is done so mindless people can enjoy it. The story itself is really quite simple and the time it took to explain it really amazes me in many ways, I also found the beginning a bit confusing but I guess it's just me. I myself generally like movies with meanings and Hero has tried to add meaning to it and it some ways it has achieved that but compare to similar movies like, For example, Crouching Tiger Hidden dragon. The meaning is just not deep enough, and this is the simplest way I can explain it. I can sense the importance of Love in this movie but I think it should have been explain clearer. The ending was not bad but it felt a bit rushed to me. I don't think they put too much thought into the ending and just call it hero because it sounded Cool or something. The music compare to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is really quite crap, I mean CTHD's scores actually moved me; the scores from Hero just went pass me like those arrows against Flying Snow. I do think CTHD is general a better film than Hero mainly because they didn't tried as hard to make the movie sell and CTHD do have a better story lines, more deeper meaning and sensible fighting scenes not like Hero. Not to mention the music was a hell lot better even through I think the same people did them .Not sure about that.After all I said, I still think Hero is a worthy of the title `Epic'. The sheer size of the environment is worth noticing, especially the army. The whole movie was beautifully shot and I gave all the credits to Yimou Zhang to his fine directing, and I really do mean this. There is not many directors in this world right now that could think like him. This is truly a masterpiece in colors used. I really love the way their bright color clothing changes in different scenes. I especially love the idea of those candles; bloody good is all I can say. The style is unlike CTHD but It feels similar in other Chinese movies but I am sure no other Chinese movies have achieved this level of style in fighting and directing. Each fight scenes is like a pair of ballet dancers drifting along with each other. Very cool indeed! I also love the use of arrows, not sure what I actually means but it sure looks damn cool seeing thousands of them flying across the sky like that. As Maggie Cheung and Tony leung are in this movie, I would assume great acting is involve ever since I saw `In the mood for Love', this couple is just tremendous on screen. The emotion in both of them could be felt from far away off screen. Jet Li was also good but everyone knows he was in it for the action and good action he did.I really do think this movie is very much for Chinese, I think very few non-Chinese people will actually understand the dialog and understand why those people do what they do. To most of them their actions will just seems strange and weird, I don't think this is a film for America to embrace, not that I am saying all Americans don't like it. Just this is not a Hollywood movie and not everyone is going to understand or even enjoy it at all. But I would encourage those who would want to see it to see it.",Hero

But now I have no choice but to confess I am tremendously eager to comment about this gigantic movie. Some says this movie is tightly coupled with another piano-wire-action Chinese movie, CTHD. However, Hero has a lot more than the movie. Have you guys notice all during the running time of this film very strong visual image effects and metaphores were used? The plot is actually not quite sophisticated even though it seems so. Main tense is presence, and Nameless and the Qin King's dialogue is what the audiences see really.And other stories about Broken Sword and Flying Snow are , in fact, not real, and has a form of variety. Director take good advantage of inner story plot .All stories has their own color and metaphore.White(Love), Green(Reminiscence), Red(Jealousy), Blue(Sacrifice), Black(Qin dynasty).After seeing this movie, I cannot lose the strong impression the each colors gave me . And, the way of effecting is similar to Kieslowski's trilogy(Bleu, Rouge, Blanc). I thought over the real meaning of Hero thanks to this movie, and the real spirit Chinese people has in their mind. This is a must for all people in the world, I recommend to see it.",Hero

Like flying thru the air for 50 yards (or whatever) . . . walking on air, climbing on air, walking on water, fighting on water, etc. I thought the story was also kinda dumb. About the only thing that makes this film worthwhile is the cinematography (which is why the 7). I put this DVD up for sale at Amazon right after I watched it. I was very impressed with Jet Li in the Lethal Weapon 4 . . . but most of what I saw in this film was way too hokey! When I see a martial arts movie (aside from Kill Bill, which was deliberately like a comic book) I want to see something that can actually be done, in real life, by real people.",Hero
375,showa48,Machiavellian...,10,17 April 2003,"(Contains some spoilers)The easiest part of Hero was enjoying the scenery and the use of colors - really well-made and captivating. Hero is definately technically a very superb movie.The harder part is the messages contained in the movie. The ""individual desires vs. the collective good"" and ""competing loyalties"" themes seem to have a strong resonance with east asian storytellers. Hero contains both of those dilemmas in it - and the solutions it poses doesn't go too well with some western viewers (a swedish reviewer called it ""beautifully wrapped fascism"").I disagree with this; in the end both ""Broken Sword"", ""Nameless"" and King Shihuang (the king of the Qin kingdom, who the four warriors ""Nameless"", Broken Sword, Flying Snow, and Sky sets out to kill) puts ""the collective"" (the Qin kingdom, and eventually united China) ahead of ""the individual"".However: King Shihuang's lust for power is NOT greater than he is willing to let himself get killed by Nameless after listening to Nameless' story about the sacrifice Broken Sword made (the throne room scene in the end of the movie). Shihuang is as much a ""spoke in the wheel"" as Nameless, Broken Sword and the two other warriors, hence I cannot interpret the messages as ""fascistic"" in any way. It's message (as I see it) is that the system sometimes comes ahead of the individual, however excellent those individuals are....AND that in the end it DOESN'T matter whether Shihuang or somebody else unites China, what matters is that it gets done.....",Hero
376,Lu-Yi-Si,"A true work of art, but with a weak plot.",9,31 December 2002,"I think this is without question the most beautiful film I've ever seen. As far as cinematography is concerned and it is a pure delight to watch. Some amazing visual effects, particularly with a fight scene in the rain, an entire army firing arrows and leaves falling from trees and changing colour all had the audience gasping. Also some stunning location filming too. I've heard some complaints however from my Chinese friends that the film is simply 'too beautiful'. This is because this film is considered to be not a true representation of the 'wushu' fighting style as it is slowed down and made more appealing for a western audience. To me this does not diminish my enjoyment of the film at all. My only complaint would be that the story although having a beautiful ethereal quality, it's only really somewhat of a weak fairy-tale. It could have had more of a historical storyline with a plot that was really leading somewhere of substance. In my view well worth seeing.",Hero

After you've seen it then go and get an extended length DVD if you really love it that much. If you haven't seen it at the cinema don't waste your money on some bootleg DVD!P.S. It's not like Crouching tiger, other than being Chinese (Taiwanese, whereas Hero is mainland). There are thousands of semi- historic fables on cinema and TV in China all the time. On nearly a third of all the 50 or more cable TV channels constantly every evening! These two movies just are not similar!",Hero
378,darkmedia,"Hero, 2002",9,20 August 2010,"Hero is simply a beautiful film. Unlike many other films, the reviewer is woven a story through different versions, first by Nameless, then by the King, and finally the Truth. As each tapestry falls, the true picture is developed. What we are left with is an epic tale of trust, wisdom and beauty that this film embodies to create a memorable experience.Summary: The film starts of with an unknown warrior, Nameless, surrounded by one-hundred thousand Qin soldiers allowing him passage to the Emperor Qin. His feat of defeating the three most dangerous assassins, Flying Snow, Broken Sword and Sky, earn him a place to drink tea with the Emperor at 100 paces.We then experience through retelling how Nameless defeats the three assassins. Nameless tells of how he and Sky battle ferociously. In front of a crowd of Qin soldiers, Nameless slips the sword between Sky's chest, instantly wounding him. He then travels to Broken Sword and Flying Snow. Nameless shows both the warriors a token of Sky's death and falsely tells Flying Snow, who's suitors are both Sky and Broken Sword that Sky's last words were that he only cared for Flying Snow and that she would avenge him. Flying Snow prepares to fight, and enraged by jealousy and rage Broken Sword declares he has no feelings for her. Deeply hurt, Flying Snow delivers a fatal blow to Broken Sword, his lasts words been 'we have both been stupid.' She then faces Moon, who is angered at her master's death. Moon tries to kill Flying Snow who easily defends against her attacks before striking a deadly blow. When she faces Nameless the next day she is deeply shaken and is killed easily.The Qin Emperor, who is deeply impressed allows him to come in within 20 paces, and then shares his retelling. Though more credible, Nameless still insists this is wrong. The Qin Emperor allows him to move forward, to 10 paces where it is revealed that Nameless is the assassin. Fueled by the grief of his murdered family Nameless declares that his special attack, is called the 10-pace-kill. The final moments are sure to moisten eyes. Use of colours (opinionated): Interestingly enough the film uses vibrant colours to spectacularly weave the tale. In the first retelling, Flying Snow and Broken Sword are portrayed as lovers filled with hate and jealousy and thus the colour red is used. In the Emperor's retelling which is more logical and learned, the colour is blue which brings to mind control and calmness. White is used in the final version to emphasize purity and the truth.I enjoyed this film very much. The score was beautiful and the cinematography was superb. Fighting sequences focused on the background and not of the actual fights. This heightened the sense of drama and skill in the fight and added serenity and emotions to the scene. If you haven't watched it, then I recommend you do. This film is a little over half an hour and I suggest watching it on a 32"" to 50"" screen with at least a 2.1 Stereo to create a cinematic watch. ****1/2 out of *****",Hero

I was highly disappointed, so much that I had to fast forward through a lot of the scenes. There was only of few minutes of fighting, while the rest was focused on being arty, and romantic. I assumed with Jet Li, and Donnie Yen in this movie, a lot of martial arts fighting would have taken place, but I assumed incorrectly. I watch movies for entertainment, and escapism.

381,chadrbailey,The prettiest piece of propaganda I've seen yet!,3,2 September 2004,"(SPOILERS, BEWARE)3/10.  It only made it to that because it's really a stunning film, in terms of beauty and martial arts choreography.  I saw this film as ""Hero"" in 2004 in the U.S. release.I remember this film being covered on a public radio program as being looked upon VERY kindly by the Chinese government for its exhortation to submit to the benevolent dictator who can unify ""our land.""  I was interested at the time, more for politics than anything else.  But now that I've seen the film, I have plenty of reasons for calling it a bad movie on its own.Up until the last 30 minutes or so, I'd give the film a 7-8/10.  Gorgeous scenery, clever but campy retellings of the same story, and some really awesome fight choreography all made me expect a lot from the end... and then it hit.I considered it a jarring switch in plot direction and intent, and frankly, motivated by attempts to ""quell"" the questioning populace under an undemocratic dictatorship.Broken Sword's sudden realization just prior to killing the king of Qin rang utterly hollow, and completely at odds with the development of his character up to that point in the movie.  Studying calligraphy taught him to submit to injustice?  At this point, the propaganda was way too thick, and I found myself dreading the rest of the movie.  Flying Snow changed from an impassioned and self-sacrificing fighter for her people to an unthinking rebel with a desire only for bloodshed.  Nameless followed the path of Broken Sword, and found peace in a pseudo-Buddhist self-annihilation represented by his body's outlined emptiness among on a wall of arrows. Very clever propaganda... individuals empty of desire (or political beliefs) are happy among a barbaric world (represented by the arrows sticking into the wall).Sorry, the ""round peg"" of the first 75% of the movie make the last 25% an unwelcome and forced tribute to George Orwell.",Hero
382,MooovieFan,Still the best of the genre,10,18 March 2006,"Ying Xiong is a rare gem among WuXia (chinese historical kung-fu) movies. It has the perfect balance of all the elements: story, writing, acting, cinematography, visual effects, music etc. The only other movies of the genre that achieved this are Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and House of Flying Daggers, and in my opinion Ying Xiong is the better of the three. All other movies in the genre are lacking in one or more of the elements, and especially lacking in the recent crop of big-budget WuXia movies are the story, writing and acting. More often than not, these movies concentrated too much on the visual effects, i.e. way too much CG with way too poor story and acting (e.g. Tsui Hark's Zu Warriors (2001), Wu Ji (The Promise 2005), Ching Din Dai Sing (Chinese Tall Story 2005)). But as exemplified perfectly in Ying Xiong, sometimes less is better than more. The spectacular and beautiful visual effects in Ying Xiong are perfectly in tune and blend in seamlessly with the rest of the movie, thus enhancing the overall experience instead of being jarring distractions like the CG used in so many other movies of the genre. But what's more important, the story in Ying Xiong has an elegance, gravity and nobility which is so seldom achieved in other movies of the genre. It's the result of mature writing and superb acting.",Hero
383,sm22281-1,Very moving reflection of the Chinese spirit,10,27 August 2004,"This visually stunning story illustrates key Chinese cultural concepts and behaviors. The twining of calligraphy, a literate art, and swordsmanship, a martial art, into a spiritual guiding principle within one's heart is a very basic tenet of Chinese accomplishments. The idea of revering high-level ideals above one's own personal goals and the willingness to sacrifice oneself is also very Chinese. The idea of deeply respecting one's enemy as an equal versus the political need to kill any potential opponents in order to establish unity is also a fundamental aspect of Chinese history and politics. As a matter of fact, Chinese people have a ubiquitous cultural tendency to compete constantly and to seek individual glory, frequently leading to dissension among the land. The sub-plot of Snow and Broken Sword's love story is also an interesting story, frequently illustrated in the Chinese psyche: how a woman can sometimes become caught up in one's own emotional perception without understanding her mate's vision and thus ultimately destroy each other... All scenes are breathtakingly haunting and gorgeous, whether the intimate indoor scenes, the outdoor scenes, the fight duels, the army maneuvers, or the face to face conversation with the Emperor Qin. I was moved to tears by the ending, the self-immolation of Nameless own free will... Martyrdom for the greater good is very much a part of the Chinese psyche. Thus, our Hero, he who is well-named.",Hero

Beautiful scenes and fight technique to die for! This movie is filled with glorious ancient Chinese culture, it shows values of friendship and of love that nowadays are almost completely lost. I liked 'crouching tiger hidden dragon' and the two 'kill bill' because i love and fully respect Asian cultures and I love that type of fighting. But when I saw 'Hero' (which was very worth watching on the big screen), it was another story because there is non stop action, you'll get to love the characters and respect the sacrifices that they had to face for the love of their own country and for the love for other people. This is maybe the most original movie I've ever seen; the directing is simply astonishing!!! Some people did not want their king to unify China and so many plans has been done to kill the king. At first we will be taught that the warrior without name 'Hero' killed the assassin that was supposed to kill the king but the story changes and we will learn all the intrigues that are present in the story.

385,AduinFox,Garbage,5,12 August 2004,"I acquired the movie Hero on a vacation to San Fransisco, where I encountered a Chinese DVD store and found it ON sale for $10 on DVD. I was initially shocked! A movie which will be released in theatres in a month, on dvd, FOR 10 DOLLARS!!!!! I snatched that movie faster than you can say `Orange Chicken'. So I brought the movie home and watched it. I was impressed at some of the battle scenes during the movie. I waited until the credits where over and then I wiped the confused look off of my face and decided that it was a bad movie. WHY HERO WAS A BAD MOVIE: 1. Movie has only major characters and no minor characters, the movie only employed 7 actors, and the Chinese army 2. Too unreal for me, Crouching Tiger was pushing my limit of Chinese flight while sword fighting, but this movie went way over the line. 3. How the movie was made chronologically, Just garbage. Quentin Tarentino tends to morph the space time continuum with his movies but Hero goes far over the edge by showing you scenes that don't have anything to do with the true plot of the movie!. 4. The moral of the movie. Basically the moral is that if you get revenge you only make things worse. 5. Again I say garbage, for a good reason to. Because that's where this new DVD is currently located in my TV room, In the garbage. (AF rating 57% out of 100) Grade F

387,hunter59,A Visually stunning epic,9,12 September 2004,Hero is a gorgeous looking movie probably best seen on the big screen. The colors are phenomenal and the action sequences are beautifully choreographed. A lot of people will probably be put off by the subtitles but this film will work best in its original language because it adds greatly to the atmosphere that you are viewing historic events in a distant land.Favorite scene is the fight sequence in the forest amid the fallen leaves. So amazing and Zhang Ziyi never seems to disappoint me. She is wonderful even in her smaller role here.The story is actually pretty simple on the surface though the fact that the scenes are not sequential will throw off some of the audience. You do need to pay attention. Then there are other layers thrown in to the story that deal with the philosophy of the Chinese people that give the story its richness. And the use of color in that respect is fantastic.Great movie,Hero
388,elephant1024,It could have been better...it could have been worse,7,5 December 2004,"When I watched Hero the first time, I left with an overwhelming feeling of disappointment. Hero is, by no means, a great movie. At best, it is mediocre. At worst, it flat out sucked. While all outward appearances would indicate this movie was made to match Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (which I thought was only a bit better than mediocre as well), it fell far short of its target. It has the production values--great costumes and use of color, amazing cinematography, excellent fight choreography, an all-star cast, a talented director, and all the other makings of a great movie. But none of these things could make up for its greatest flaw. Like all other ""westernized"" Chinese movies these days (CTHD being the first, Hero, House of Flying Daggers, Warriors of Heaven and Earth, Shaolin Soccer, etc.) the story is sadly found wanting, some more than others. Without doubt, Hero falls into the middle of the pack.My gripes with Hero's story is its meaningless, meandering nature. Like all other westernized Chinese movies, it was made to make money, to showcase incredible eyecandy and cool fight scenes. But note that every year, dozens of such movies are made in Hong Kong, since Shaw Brothers and the golden age of kung fu movies in the 60's and 70's. Western and westernized audiences will probably find these movies great, but only because they do not know how to tell a diamond from a cubic. Then again, because Chinese culture and history is so great (in terms of size), it may be that western and westernized audiences will not understand what makes a diamond like Once Upon a Time in China a diamond and not a cubic.Hero takes place during the Qin dynasty near the end of the Warring States period. The Emperor, Qin Shi Huang, was a ruthless tyrant who stopped at nothing to completely conquer all of China. Partly out of fear of what should happen should this emperor defeat the other states, partly because it was the way of things in that day and age, assassins from the other states decided to attempt to assassinate the Qin Emperor. Hero is about the journey of a group of elite assassins in their bid to kill the Qin Emperor.My disagreement with the political message the PRC government required to be included in the movie before allowing it to be produced aside, I found the story boring and trite. For one, it attempts to redefine the meaning of ""hero"" by labeling certain characters heroic when they really did not fit into the idea of being a hero, on top of an overused cliché of the hero. In effect, Jet Li and Tony Leung's characters are fake heroes, or ones created and honored only by their enemies--which left me in a state of limbo. Was Jet Li the hero or the anti-hero? Knowing Chinese history, and thus what was to come after the events of the movie, it is difficult to say.My next comment is that the story doesn't really move. Much of the movie is a flashback, but most of the flashbacks don't really advance anything, except perhaps the intrigue that is supposed to surround the characters. Unfortunately, because of this, it feels as if the plot is moving in circles. While there's nothing wrong with one big circle, Hero seems determined to traverse the same circle several times, each time offering slightly more insight into what happened that the previous traversal did not offer. A whole hour is wasted in the movie doing this.Finally, while the acting by most of the cast is above par, the movie offers no opportunity to actually relate to them. Thus, the outcome seems trivial and unimportant. Indeed, throughout all of the supposedly emotional scenes, I knew I was supposed to be feeling something for the characters, but there simply was nothing to emotionally grasp. For example, when the character played by Donnie Yen dies early on in the movie while fighting Jet Li, there is supposed to be sadness at his passing, for the character was considered a great hero of his people. Yet, it seemed almost as if the movie shrugged it off. Again, I blame the story for not developing the characters more.In the end, I must admit that it wasn't ridiculously terrible, and that it is still quite watchable--as much so as CTHD in fact, which may or may not be a good thing. It is merely unfortunate that it does not live up to its hype, or for that matter, its potential. I would have to say that watching one of Jet Li's B-movie, The Evil Cult would be far more entertaining than watching Hero. Even though the story was left hanging for a part two that was never made, the screenplay was adapted well (albeit very loosely) for the 1.5-hour format, and even though some of the characters were introduced late into the movie, they still had far more personality than the characters in Hero.",Hero
389,sarmoti_tiger,Crazy beautiful artwork of a movie!,8,2 February 2006,"""Hero"" is so beautiful it's almost borderline crazy. I've never payed so much attention to a film's color, scenery and such before...the cinematography is just mind-blowing.The story is good - Jet Li plays a nameless hero who meets the Emperor of Qin after he defeats 3 of the Emperor's most powerful assassins (Sky, Flying Snow and Broken Sword played by Donnie Yen, Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung respectively). The ""hero"" explains to the Emperor how he defeated the 3 assassins, prompting a series of flashbacks. After hearing the stories, the Emperor realizes that the ""hero"" is actually the most dangerous assassin of all and everything was just a set up for him to get close enough to the Emperor so he could use his special move ""Death at ten steps"" which is such an uber-cool name.What's interesting is the film's use of imagery to tell the story. During the first set of flashbacks about Broken Sword and Flying Snow, everything is in red: everyone's wearing red, the background is red, everything. Move on to the king's interpretation of what really happened: everything is in blue. Finally, ""hero"" reveals the truth and the flashback shows everything in white (and there's also this green scene which cannot be missed!). It turns something which could have potentially been amazingly annoying (three flashbacks of pretty much the same incident) into three separate stories. The scenery is also something to be amazed at. The fighting scene on the lake between the hero and broken sword is one of the most beautiful moments I've ever seen on a screen. Without all the brilliant cinematography the film would, quite frankly, not even be half of what it is. Don't take that as a bad thing though because honestly, it's just too pretty to not be watched. You'll probably want to watch it again just to analyze the film's use of color.The fighting too, without a doubt, is worth a mention. Of course, with Jet Li and Donnie Yen in it, action and intense Kung Fu is expected. Li is his usual amazing Kung Fu fighting self but all other characters, like Cheung's character and Zhang Ziyi's character also do some impressive butt-kicking (the fight scene between those two female characters is also amazingly beautiful. Both are dressed in red and fight in the midst of swirling yellow leaves).With the actual acting, it's all convincing. Li maintains a placid face almost throughout the entire movie and this just makes his character all the much cooler. Donnie Yen is good in his part...although it lasts for like 10 minutes and he has a really annoying strand of hair in front of his face. Maggie Cheung is incredibly cold...which is a good thing because that's what her character is. Zhang Ziyi is....well...her character is pretty weird so let's forget about that. In terms of Tony Leung, personally, I don't think he looks very Kung Fu-esquire so it was weird for me to see him as one of the ""most powerful"" assassins (there's this one bit when Jet Li's character explains to the king: ""Broken sword (Leung's character) is probably equal to me in ability"" and I just couldn't help but find that weird because Leung just didn't look it. I know I'm supposed to think of them in terms of the characters they were playing and not the actual actors...but seriously...comparing Tony Leung to Jet Li in terms of Kung Fu???). He looked more nomad-like than anything else but other than that, his acting was good...just a matter of me not being a fan of him.This movie's not perfect though of course. Some bits were just plain weird (like the scene where ""hero"" and Sky fight 'in their minds' which I kinda thought, yea right they're gonna close their eyes in a middle of a fight and leave themselves totally open for attack). Even though the movie itself is not that long, it IS extremely slow paced. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that I watched ""Fist of Fury"" just before watching ""Hero"" but to me, even the fighting scenes seemed slower than grip-the-edge-of-your-seat speed. I guess that it's deliberate because again, it does make it more beautiful and this movie isn't trying to be the next blood and guts action movie with monster trucks.So I guess, if you're looking for an all out action flick, rent Die-Hard instead (or ""Fist of Fury"" if you want Kung Fu fighting). If you're looking for something that will totally amaze you and make you want to live in a pagoda in the middle of a lake in China, Hero is the way to go. Good stuff. Makes you think...and most importantly, has JET LI (and he's the coolest character!!)",Hero

391,ckkoay,A Stunning Visual Poetry...,9,22 January 2003,"Zhang Yimou was quoted to have said that ""Hero"" was his most commercial work to date. I am happy to say that the director of such great classics like ""Raise the Red Lantern"", ""Judou"", ""Not One Less"" has not let his artistic touch play second fiddle to the lavish and majestic settings where this movie takes place.I won't be commenting much about the story. Anyone who enjoyed Kurusawa's ""Rashamon"" will find this movie to be a little more than a deja-vu. But then what makes this movie great is the treatment of the story in itself. Told and retold in different narative viewpoints, audiences get to see a story that slowly unravels itself. The investment in time and attention will be greatly paid off at the end when the ""hero"" has to make a choice between staying true to his beliefs or abandoning them for a greater good.This movie itself is filled with dramatic and fantastic fight sequences that had never quite been captured on film before. Christopher Doyle, known for his work with Wong Kar-Wai, has shown great restraint in the camerawork- making each frame of the movie tight and beautiful, almost good enough to be framed as an art work in a museum. One dissatisfaction that I had was that the score by Tan Dun is reminiscent of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".Zhang Yimou's touch can clearly be seen in the acting. Some of the character's face, though revealing no apparent emotion, can convey their thoughts. And that is the beauty of this movie. It seizes you from the very begining and makes you think every step of the way. Production quality was exceptional with generous but not overtly whimsical shots of Chinese mountains, lakes and desserts.  The version that I saw was 90 minutes long, though I did read reports that a 3 hour version is being shown in some parts of China.",Hero
392,cla68,Propaganda Disguised as Art,7,2 September 2004,"""Hero"" is visually stunning and beautifully filmed.  Unfortunately, the film represented, in my belief, an effort on the part of Communist China to justify the foreign policy they have pursued since the tragedy of the Communist take-over of that great country.The justification that the mainland Chinese government uses for their invasions and occupations of Tibet and portions of India, Mongolia, and Vietnam, as well as their continued threats against Taiwan, is that all of these territories were historically part of a ""unified,"" Chinese kingdom. The Chinese point to the earlier, ""unified"" Chinese dynasties to support their claim.This movie attempts to show the 1st Dynasty, the Qim, in a positive light by arguing that it united China in ""peace"" and created the uniform writing system still used in China and other Asian countries today.  The writing system claim may be true, but I personally doubt that the Qim emperor was really motivated by thoughts of ""eternal peace under heaven"" when he brutally conquered his neighboring Asiatic kingdoms.  Also, I don't believe that a ""unified"" China that includes any territory or people that ever belonged to any of the Chinese dynasties, is necessarily the true ""essence of the sword and calligraphy"" as this movies states.The victors do write the history books and that is what China is trying to do with this beautifully filmed movie.",Hero
393,KublaiBK,Stunning with expert craftsmenship,10,4 April 2003,"Zhang Yimou is one of the best filmmakers alive.  All I needed to see was Red Shorgum to know this, but Hero confirmed it.  With this cast (5 of China's (and the world's) best), crew , and budget, this film was basically destined to be great.  Even with that, I was worried Zhang might take the Kung Fu movie and slow it down (like his later work) beyond recognition. Thank the gods this did not happen.  It was quickly paced with innovative and beautiful fights that were shot as well as anything Zhang yimou has done (which is saying a lot).  The first fight of the film was particularly incredible in it's editing, sound, choreography, and cinematography.  And the narrative structure and characters were interesting enough not to get in the way of the shear beauty of this film.A couple of extra notes before I go... This movie has nothing in common with Crouching Tiger besides genre, so stop comparing them because you've seen no other Kung Fu movies, it's ridiculous. Also, if Miramax releases a shortened version in theaters (which is likely) call Miramax and tell them you hate them, because that's just stupid.  And finally, to the Americans reading, I implore you to go and find out why Zhang Yimou is as good as Scorcese and anyone else in the US and, indeed, is head and shoulders above the rest in terms of cinematography.  His films are consistently more beautiful than anything else I've seen.  I HIGHLY recommend Red Shorgum and Ju Dou.  They rock.  As does Hero...with authority.",Hero

The fate of the numerous minorities in China (the most visible being the Uighurs and the Tibetans), as well as ethnic Chinese people who are persecuted for other reasons makes the stance of this movie pernicious.That the sacrifice of many individuals (by choice or not) is always better for the collective? To make such a visually-arresting and well-acted film in this day and age, given the mass violation of human rights by the Chinese government, and to attempt to put such ""message"" under the banner of ""culture"" and ""history"" is abominable. The Chinese people deserve better than this sentimental, manipulative nationalism.The stance is so central to the story that you cannot separate it from its artistic and technical worth.

399,notcliched,Quite possibly the most beautiful film you have or will ever see,9,4 June 2005,"When I first heard about Hero, I thought to myself that someone had come along and decided to cash in on the success of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. When I saw that Jet Li was in it, my expectations dropped even further. Nevertheless, out of pure boredom or desire to be entertained if nothing else, I decided to watch Hero.By the end of the film, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was no longer in my mind. Mouth agape and heart-aching, I couldn't remember when I'd last seen a film so beautiful, so powerful and so brilliantly made. I also made a mental note to begin considering Jet Li as an actor.Hero is set in an ancient China over two thousand years ago. At that time, China was split into seven smaller countries. The king of Qin (the largest of these countries), waged many wars against the other countries. As can be expected, this made him rather unpopular with the other six nations. From this, assassins arose whose entire purpose in life is to rid the world of this man. Three of deadliest of these assassins are Broken Sword (Tony Leung), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Sky (Donnie Yen). So, when a Nameless warrior (Jet Li) is brought to the king's palace, claiming to have killed all three, he is hailed as a hero.The film proceeds to reveal Nameless' story. But soon, it is revealed that all is not what it seems and there is more to Nameless than it at first glance. And, by the end of the film, he is hailed as a hero for a completely different reason.Yes, it is a martial arts film, but one that is made by Zhang Yimou. This means that there is a solid story. Nonetheless, the fight sequences are breathtaking and beautiful to witness. However, the action can seem superfluous and tedious, and is the reason for why it takes the film so long to reveal the main body of the plot.The story is carried by a strong cast, who bring some very good characters to life. Chen Daoming, who plays the king, in my opinion, gives the best performance. But it is one that is rivalled by that of Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung, whose chemistry together really makes their heartbreaking story so much more real. Though completely overshadowed by the aforementioned talent, Jet Li proves that he is more than just an action star. And Zhang Ziyi shows once again why she is a rising star.Undoubtedly, the most striking thing about this film is the cinematography and art direction. The lavishly filmed scenes at gorgeous locations are just one of the many visual treats in store for the viewer. The superb use of colour begs an explanation, but whether there are some deeper reasons behind their use or whether it was just what took Zhang Yimou's fancy is irrelevant to how provocative it is. To top it off, the king's palace is a lovingly created set and one to rival any of any film ever made and this is epitomised in the scene where Jet Li descends a flight of steps surrounded by a circle of soldiers.The outstanding visuals are backed by some brilliant musical scores composed by Tan Dun (who also did Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon). It was a strong tool that Zhang Yimou used very well. It supported, but never moved to the forefront, of the visual drama.Unfortunately, being in Chinese, not much can be said about the script. However, being Chinese (grew up in England), I was able to understand parts of it and what I did seemed impeccable. But I am disappointed at how the script was completely butchered by the translation on the DVD.Even though it is not perfect, Hero is a film filled with passion and drama, culminating in a message as powerful and glaringly obvious as the myriad of colours used. And whilst comparisons are unavoidable, it is not Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. It doesn't stand with Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. It stands just as how a Hero should. Alone.",Hero
400,GarethBeaumains,This was an opera of motion.,10,7 September 2004,"I kept thinking this movie was staged like an opera. The Emperor's courtiers all spoke in unison like a chorus. The colors, the sets, the movements. It was dramatic, poetic, vivid.The movie also kept one guessing through its retelling of the same tale at different layers. There were some parts of the movie telegraphed surely ahead of time. Moments when you knew how it would inexorably resolve. Yet one watched them to see the playing out of tragic demise, just as one might watch Hamlet or Romeo and Juliet. It was not that they were to die, but how.The key to it was the periods of inaction. The pauses before the display of violence, or after.

403,dani18,A interesting point I would like to state,8,14 March 2003,"First of all, I AM CHINESE. Note that this is pretty important to what I'm about to say. I hope to comment on this film from a Chinese point of view. ALSO: **WARNING** SOME SPOILERS CONTAINED.1. I am proud of the cinematography of this film. Usually you won't find a Chinese film as breathtaking as your average Hollywood blockbuster, but Hero is an exception. It is by far the most beautiful martial arts film yet, and when I say this I mean both the kung-fu and the scenery. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon's kung-fu scenes are pretty boring in my eyes. It was a bit of a shame that the best kung-fu scene was put at the beginning, where two great kung-fu ""artists"" Jet Li and Donnie Yen fight. These two actors really know kung-fu, thus the fighting is the best to watch, although it isn't as visually stunning as some later scenes (like the one when the leaves changes colour).2. I am aware that some western audiences are still not accustomed to kung-fu scenes that defy gravity and other basic physics lawss. This is a bit culturally related. For example, a lot of Chinese people aren't really interested in The Lord Of the Rings. They don't really believe that there could be magical forces, goblins, elves and etc. On the other hand, we do believe that ancient kung-fu masters could ""fly"" and so on, and hence we make films like that. Hero is mild in these areas. A lot of kung-fu films nowadays has swordsmen sending out ""laser beams"" with their hands of swords. It's just to make the fighting look more intense and exciting.3. The plot of Hero, and the message that it tries to concieve (that the true hero should sacrifice himself for peace, for the country and blah blah blah) is too ancient to really arouse interest in Chinese audiences. This theme has been told too many times before in kung-fu (wuxia) novels, and basically anybody who loves wuxia novels knows it. Therefore Hero received a lot of criticism for its pale storyline. And telling the story three times in a little more than 90 minutes is both rather dumb and unrealistic. There's hardly any depth. And also the dialogues are too poorly written. There are basic mistakes like the emperor saying the chinese word for ""peace"", which is impossible, because at that time in history there was no such word as the one he used. Things like that really let this film down.3.5 I am going to expand a bit on the pale storyline. Maybe fellow IMDBers don't agree with me. That's perfectly normal. The difference is still in the culture. Like I said, because nearly every Chinese knows this theme, therefore to tell it in a very simple way would seem (to us Chinese) silly; whereas other audiences who aren't familiar with the background and the theme will find it fascinating. Modern Wuxia that attracts Chinese audiences would seem totally inunderstandable from the average foreign audience's point of view, because you don't know all the background info that the film assumes you do.4. A bit on the actors. It might be interesting to fellow IMDBers to know that Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung were sort of joked at for their bad Mandarin. It was kind of funny. The way Daoming Chen said his lines were also a bit too theatre like, as if he was performing a play and not a film.5. By now you'll probably thinking why I am criticizing the film so much. I think that what really affected Hero from being a classic is that it cares too much about looks and forgot to tell a decent story. It's a beautiful film, but nothing more, and that's a shame, because with such a cast and such a director there could have been a lot more. Yet I'm still proud of Hero as a Chinese, because I think we need to make some commercial films like Hero, as the current film industry in China isn't really booming. Anyway, Hero, with all its faults, still won a landslide victory at the Chinese box-office. And that's really important. But if you're interested in some real kung-fu films, I recommend films like New Dragon Gate Inn(made in the 1990s, and one of my favourite wuxia films) and some of Jet Li's earlier series. They are both enjoyable and interesting.",Hero
404,ZaWolven,Most beautiful film ever made?,9,29 September 2004,"Well maybe, maybe not, but there's no doubt it's something special. Right from the films opening moments through to the spectacular finale, Ying Xiong (Hero) manages to create both a sense of scale to equal Lord of the Rings while focussing on the individual stories of the central characters.Although this is advertised as Jet Li's film, and while he certainly has the lion's share of the action, the heart of this film belongs to Tony Leung Chiu Wai (Broken Sword) and Maggie Cheung (Flying Snow). Their romance, while not the main plot of the film, is by far the most intimate and intriuging part of a film which doesn't shy away from trying to link a story around its mind-blowing action sequences.Whether it achieves this is debatable, for while the Sword/Snow subplot has substance the main plot, although simply told, has its problems, especially as an audience trying to follow the story through subtitles may get slightly confused from time to time as to what exactly just happened. But just be glad the studio resisted the urge to dub it, for having the film in any language other than Mandarin would surely detract from it.Having said that though, the most compelling sequences are those where everyone shuts up and the astounding cinematography does the talking. Every fight scene from the golden autumn forest to the tranquil lake is beautifully choreographed and wonderfully shot. The film is told as a series of flashbacks, with each one having a different colour theme, such as Red, Blue, White and Green. But although this may sound like a gimmick to Western audiences, each colour represents an emotion in China and all the colour themes are just subtle enough so that, while still glaringly obvious, they act only as an aid to the story, rather than taking it over.This is an astonishingly beautiful film to look at and, although the central story is a little thin, fine performances and the aforementioned fight scenes mean this film is a cut above most martial arts films.",Hero
405,Anansi00,A Work of Art,9,29 November 2004,"I give this movie credit for being one of the most unique and beautiful that I have ever seen. Ying Xiong's acting, dialogue, and inherent art make it a standard of excellence.Going into this movie, I was expecting some sort of stock Chinese action movie, with costumes and Jet Li. What I saw was a grand but unassuming epic. The movie is based upon a historical legend dating back to the early days of China's history. The story concerns with Nameless, an anonymous commoner who has earned the gratitude of the King of Qin for his defeat of three legendary assassins who sought the King's blood. Nameless is invited to meet with the King to tell the tale of his exploits, and from there begins a solemn epic, driven by the hero's travels and exploits and enriched by a touch of fantasy. I am hardly versed in Chinese film (or foreign film, for that matter), but this one has whetted my appetite for more.Zhang's artistic vision is like no one else's, crafting inspired scenes and original action sequences that surpass the most skillful and high-minded of Hollywood's fare. Most obvious is, of course, his use of color for symbolic and thematic purposes, but I was also pleased with his manipulation of point of view and his reliance upon dialogue and character to balance out the action.Of course, all of that is, to some, a mere frame for the action sequences, which do not disappoint. Not to betray any spoilers, but from the very beginning, Zhang thinks outside the box in terms of how to make each fight original and poetic. In my opinion, there was a little too much computer enhancement (especially in the lake scene), which detracted from the quality of the choreography. Still, overall, I thought the action was superb.For as significant as the fights are, this is not just a great martial arts flick, but a great movie. That can only arise from the strength of the story and characters. The story is absorbing and masterful, and the characters are deep and superbly acted. The ideology and philosophy that surfaces throughout the movie and ultimately emerges as the story's thematic center may mesh well with Chinese communist doctrine, but I found it heartfelt and persuasive. The story blends action, character, and fantasy so well that it seems to have sprung, fully formed, from the mind of a genius.As a final note, I have to give great praise to the sheer beauty of the movie. Every setting, every scene is a visual masterpiece. Clearly, Zhang directed this movie with the intent of crafting a masterpiece, and he succeeded with one of the most visually inspiring movies ever made.From its art to its action to its acting, this is an epic of superlative quality, and I recommend it to everyone.",Hero

This is one of those films. Hero is 'a tale about loyalty and trust, about a code of honour among warriors'. It follows the story of a nameless assassin (Li) in the third century BC in China who tells the King of Qin that he has killed his three fiercest enemies. But is he telling the truth? This is the first action film from director Yimou Zhang and features non-action actors (Cheung, Ziyi and Chen) who manage to look like pros. They even did most of their own stunts at the director's request. The house of chess sequence includes a traditional Hong Kong style fight sequence from martial arts legends Jet Li and Donnie Yen. Hero is full of strong, vibrant colours and great choreography. Some of the film is shot in black and white (the house of chess sequence) and some scenes are almost totally red. Colour plays a dominant role as it has many connotations. It gives the film a stylised look. Hero is full of visual poetry. The wood sequence where Moon (Ziyi) seeks vengeance after her master's death is a spectacular action sequence. As Moon and Flying Snow (Cheung) fight, hundreds of golden leaves fly through the air. My favourite sequence is the one on the lake. It is so beautifully shot. It took three weeks to film as the water had to be perfectly still but it was worth it. It is one of the most memorable sequences of the film. The blue of Broken Sword's (Leung Chiu Wai) clothes blends well with the setting. There is a lot of wire work and when Broken Sword and Nameless bounce off the water you can imagine how much time and effort went into the choreography. The scenes of Hero are full of emotion and the music reflects the mood of the characters well. It also features a lot of exotic locations. Hero ticks all of the right boxes - action, story, direction, music, mise-en-scene, location... I could go on forever. You'll have a hard job finding a better DVD to rent this week-end.",Hero
409,Bloodriver,Chinese enchantment and beyond,10,25 September 2006,"A splendid magical work of cinematic calligraphy, beautifully authentic watermarks, and a dream of spellbinding cinematography, Hero is a movie soaked in a captivating Chinese spirit that never fails the viewer at any time, the story of an ambiguous warrior and his memories in defeating three infamous assassins, but it doesn't stop there and will surely take you far beyond your boundaries and will emotionally sway at many major points, and will arouse imminent feelings of passion, grieve and glory. The directing is superb, succeeded in carrying out the visuals intact with the storyline and the acting which is not quite solid but fair enough for the atmosphere, and I'd advise you to watch it in Mandarin and use English subtitles, it will feel more original. Hero is a movie that happens only in thoughts, so it wouldn't be wise to always refer to reality, for example the incredible fighting scenes are hard to believe but if you'd imagine yourself dreaming of it, it will get closer to your mind, watch it with your heart and you'll certainly enjoy it. Overall, hero is a must see to all enchanting marital arts patriotic spirited movie lovers, I know this isn't a category, but I certainly recommend it, and remember to feel what you see and most important of all to acknowledge the meaning of a Hero in the movie.",Hero

I thought it was going to be a pointless film showing off the vast array of wild moves that martial artists are capable of. Yet, when we rented it, I sat down and saw it. I was truly in awe when I did, it's one of the two movies that have actually gotten that reaction from me. Yes, the theme is complicated, and the movie itself is hard to follow (if you don't pay close attention)-the only inferring factor I've found is that people seem to focus too hard on the subtitles, or from what I know of. But, in all honesty, I appreciate art in true form; this is a piece of it that I highly appreciate for many reasons, the reasons being that this has an elegant storyline (depicting the birth of a nation: China), with each story being beautifully told with a predominant colour to emphasize the mood), the astonishing fight scenes (the movie, surprisingly, was not built upon one fight scene after another... which made them even more enjoyable to watch), the fluent dialogue (though all of it was subtitled-thank God, I hate dubbing in film-if you paid well enough attention to it without being distracted from the overall beauty of the movie, you'd understand that it was worded and translated masterfully), the scenery used, and the brilliant cinematography, which goes hand in hand with what I said about the colours. There's not much else I can say without spoiling at least something about the movie... but I recommend this for anyone who appreciates a brilliant piece of art shown through film, as well as follow along with a movie that has a rather sporadic way of storytelling and subtitles... whole-heartedly. 10/10 - This definitely is my favourite movie of all time!",Hero

This message of ""all under heaven"" (or greater china) being the supreme idea to uphold even if it means death and suffering for many is indeed an unforgivable slap in the face for all those who have suffered from tyranny or even found death when trying to challenge the people in power. The ""message"" is taken to an extreme when the ""wise"" King of Qin orders, with a tear in his eyes, to execute the nameless hero even after he aborted his plans to kill the king.... since the law needs to be enforced to keep order in the kingdom, right? In the movie, Nameless accepts his faith willingly and is obviously aware that it's all for the ""greater good"". For everyone remembering the tienanmen square massacre in 1989 this kind of blatant propaganda is just disgusting.

416,Sherwin,A waste of money and time,2,9 March 2003,"""Hero/YingXiong"" is a self-important movie that incorporates much of what is bad with Hollywood, and is a huge disappointment from Zhan Yimou - who should be leading chinese films into a much more progressive direction. It borrows ideas from Crouching Tiger, The Matrix, Rashomon, and adds a plot with no backbone and characters as shallow as it gets. This is the 22nd movie I watched this year, and very possibly the worst one.Martial arts movies traditionally stress a sense of fun and silliness, but we cannot ignore Ang Lee's infinitely superior Crouching Tiger had raised the genre to a new level by bringing a sense of urgency in the plot, and combining great cinematography in a way that adds to the experience. Unfortunately it has been brought down again to new lows by ""Hero"". All the slow-motion and artsy feeling do not fit in well here at all. There is no coherence, as the movie strives to be everything and achieves very little but to bore us again and again. The sense of fun is taken away by the slow pace and characters we are not made to care about. The simplistic message at the crux of the movie (""heaven under"") shows us a jingoistic view of the world, which most informed viewers will not appreciate.
Jet Li does a good job though, maybe the only positive impression I came out with.I am thoroughly disappointed by Zhang Yimou and don't feel he is leading the pack of chinese filmmakers that we should look forward to achieving greatness. I would refer all who watched this to see ""Emperor and the Assassin"", which is a straightforward (non-kung-fu) story which is also about the Qin emperor and his assassin - an old fashioned linear plot that works. Or go rewatch ""Rashomon"" for a true classic, for a similar structured plot that IS coherent.",Hero

418,Kleiny,Hype me,3,2 February 2005,"If this is meant to pass for entertainment, the Chinese didn't know it. Zhang Yimou has seen the value in turning from relationship studies to action films, particularly in Ang Lee's case, but he has not succeeded here.It has to be said, though, that Chris Doyle's cinematography is par excellence. He truly is a magnificent cinematographer, even taking into account the MOUNTAIN of grading done to the film.But back to the story. It is obviously meant as some kind of homage to Rashomon, which is great for Sino-Japanese relations, but he really doesn't pull it off here. For one thing, Rashomon was not ponderous. In fact you could say Rashomon bolted quite nicely along. In comparison to this film...but that's not fair. This film is ponderous all on it's own. You would think by the comments of most critics that they saw a rollicking good Chinese action flick, and not a pretentious exercise of western-abating aesthetics. Even though the film is only 90 minutes long, it feels 45 minutes too long.There are very many interesting stories in Chinese culture about Qin Shuang-ti, and this ain't one of them. Well maybe it is, I just think Yimou got it wrong this time, because I love his films, and I love Chinese action, but this feels like an unholy compromise.Having said that, I look forward to House of Flying Daggers.",Hero
419,kchee,"Zhang Yimou returns to epic filmmaking with a wonderful story, brilliant cinematography and acting.",9,27 November 2002,"Hero has to be a labor of love for China's preeminent filmmaker, Zhang Yimou. Based on a Chinese legend about China's first emperor Qin Shihuang and the assassins sent to assassinate him. Zhang Yimou returns to epic filmmaking last seen in To Live (1994), employing a style that that is so unique and distinctly Zhang.Hero is definitely the most ambitious Zhang film in over 8 years, with a story of historical proportions encompassing honor, love, determination and sacrifice. Set over two thousand years ago, during the time of China's Warring States period, the King of the Qin kingdom set out to unite Qin with the other six kingdoms. It was his determination to carry out his mission that made him a target of assassins from the other kingdoms. Even though he has managed to escape previous attempts, he has become fearful of three legendary assassins - Broken Sword, Falling Snow and Sky.Hero opened with the arrival of what seems to be China's new hero, Nameless, to King Qin's palace. Nameless has succeeded in defeating the other three assassins and was promised significant wealth as his reward.
In Hero, Zhang has succeeded in constructing an epic tale of honor, love and intrigue. The story is told as a conversation between the King and Nameless and in a Rashomon-esque style, Zhang brought to live a wonderful landscape filled with color and sound as the audience is magically transported back to ancient China. Zhang's directing and cinematography is impeccable and the acting was superb. Zhang has brought together a world renowned cast consisting of Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung - the two were simply amazing as Falling Snow and Broken Sword. Zhang Ziyi has also proven herself as a force to be reckoned with her powerful performance as Moon, Broken Sword's loyal student and servant. Finally, veteran actor Chen Daoming gave a strong performance as King Qin.Hero is an amazing movie. The directing, acting, cinematography, story, editing and music will leave you in awe and begging for more. There will many who will want to compare this to Crouching Tiger. I have been a fan of Zhang for almost ten years and I firmly believe Zhang did not intend to copy Crouching Tiger. You will be enthralled with the martial arts in Hero as you were in Crouching Tiger but the focus is not on the martial arts but the drama and the intrigue. The ""fighting scenes"" seem to flow like the soundtrack, complemented by the most wonderful use of color.Hero is testimony of Zhang as one of the world's most talented director.

422,Sunny99,WHY a beautiful movie with a STUPID message can't be a great movie.,2,2 September 2004,"This movie is visually beautiful indeed, but the story is just plainly stupid. Do not agree? Read on.We have 6 very well-educated Asian people, all know this part of famous Chinese history more or less, watching this movie together. At the end, some feel so disappointed about the story, and the others, worse, felt so disgusted by its built-in political messages.  Praise its photography as you wish, but please don't tell me this is a great movie.  A beautiful movie with a terrible message can't be a great movie. It simply is NOT.Even with my high respect for Mr. Zhang's earlier works, I can't help but feel so disappointed with this overhyped film.
Warning: Spoiler ahead (The version I watched is the original Asian release issued in 2002, which is longer than this US version.)1. Brief historic background In this movie, the King of Qin state use his powerful troops mercilessly to invade the six other states in early China, and eventually conquered them all to form his Qin empire.Historically, he was the first emperor to ""unite"" China. In reality, he was the cold-blooded tyrant who achieved his ambition with brutal force and at the cost of numberless people's lives and blood. One chinese legend stated that his troop was ordered to kill (bury alive) 400,000 surrendered soldiers from the neighbor state ""Zhao"" after one battle, just to crush the morale of other resisting forces. This is just one of countless example of what he did to ""unite"" China.Due to his tyranny, people hated him so much, especially those from the six other conquered states. The great empire he spent his lifetime to build only last for 15 years, one of the shortest in China's history. The empire soon turned into another chaotic battle field with all the uprising forces fighting against his heir, until another new dynasty (Han).The most laughable part (and historically incorrect) in this movie is that, although the assassin have gone through so many years of preparation aiming to kill this brutal tyrant to save his own country and people, he was so [unbelievably] easily persuaded (or tricked) by this King to give up his life-long mission, even at the cost of his own life, and knowingly let this tyrant and his massive force finish crushing all other countries.A graceful assassin? or an unbelievably stupid idiot? Of course the history ended with the King has his way and had all the people in China kneel before him.  What a glorious story with a extremely stupid assassin.2. The ""message""?  Is this really a propaganda film?So the ""message"" of this movie: the best way for suffering people to end war is letting the powerful invading force finish their job, letting the brutal tyrant be the emperor, without resisting or trying to kill him, then we will all get peace and become one ""united great country"" ?In short: Let the big bad guy have his way with us, and then we can all live peacefully afterward?  How intelligent and creative!!If the message in this movie is so true, why should people fight in WW2? We should let Hitler conquer Europe and there will be no war over there after he finish all others, just a great ""glorious"" NAZI empire?? We should let Japanese conquer the East Asia (including China) so there will be no more fighting and killing over there either???This is exactly why some people in Asia call this movie a piece of communist propaganda.  This is a good piece of work to teach the people to let their powerful (totalitarian or not) government have its way, no matter how bad or controling it is, so that there will be ""stability"" and a ""glorious united country"".Now you know why Zhang Yi-Mou, whose earlier works were not really appreciated by the officials in China, was suddenly so well funded and supported by Beijing in making this movie.Am I biased? Well, I guess so. I know so much about this part of Chinese history and also the connection between this film and the Chinese government, that I just can't pretend I am [objective] to call this movie a piece of ""pure art"".This movie did not do too well in Asia.  I am surprised it do quite well in the US.  Funny.Praise its photography as you wish, but please don't tell me this is a great movie.  A beautiful movie with a terrible message can't be a great movie. It is NOT.Sorry Mr. Zhang, I can only give you 3 stars out of 10 this time.

425,mdx,A feast for the eyes!,8,14 March 2003,"Reading the comments there seems to be many people who believe this movie is a money-ripper. However, if they read Chinese history about Emperor QIN he did in fact unite the seven kingdoms into China and rightly named himself the first Emperor of China (the one who built the terracotta figures and the Great Wall of China). History records that the emperor allows no one to approach him without his consent, and that he sleeps in a different bedroom every night just to dodge assassins.Because there were so many assassination attempts, it is easy to incorporate this story into history (albeit a biased one - since the Emperor QIN was in every aspect a tyrant). Chen Dao Ming (Emperor QIN) is one of the finest actors in China and it is a pity that he played this role since he could convey a whole series of emotions just from his eyes. Therefore, it was fictitious that the movie suggested the Emperor felt a great sadness at the end. He could not have, he was never noted for having any emotions.As for the rest of the characters. Jet Li, Maggie Cheung etc. I don't care much for their acting but people should note that in Chinese Kung-Fu novels all swordsmen of some talent had an air of coolness about them.It is interesting to note that all locations were filmed in China. And the lake with it's different colored scenes - I heard that they had to be there at specific times. As for the much-loved maple leaf scene. That's real and not a prop. The leaves in that little forest all turn red at the exact time and it happens only once a year so the movie had to wait for it, I guess.

I've watched it twice so far and I've still got a week to see it again (and again, and again....). There's a powerful, wonderfully compelling story that builds tension as the scenes progress. The fight sequences are dazzling and poetic with beautiful scenery and terrific sets. The colors used in the various scenes add mood and drama to an already sumptuous visual feast. The music, especially those drums, make me yearn for a Dolby 5.1 decoder. (I'll call my other brother to see if I can borrow his system for the week.) It's flawless.

The story appears to be fairly straightforward - set in China in the 3rd Century BC a nameless warrior (Jet Li) reports to the King of Qin how he has killed three of his most feared and dangerous enemies. But things are not so simple and we are taken on a journey of several versions of events.The cinematography is as good as anything you will see. Stunning landscapes are intertwined with scenes featuring close up slow motion work. The use of colour is spectacular, some scenes having a theme colour which is changed as we move forward. The fight scenes are fantastical with the protagonists gliding through the air swirling swords and spears in their amazing costumes. They've obviously used a large amount of wire work but unlike say The Matrix you are left admiring the grace of the movements rather than being conscious of special effects.The scale is grand, they appear to have used thousands of extras rather than CGI, and the result is impressive. There is some CGI used but it is seamless and complements rather than dominating.The soundtrack is a pleasure to hear. Funky Chinese music with plenty of drums a-banging while swords are a-clanking. And after all the main characters have spent the whole movie trying to kill each other the themes that emerge are love and peace. A nice twist.As you can probably tell I really enjoyed this movie.

For this he is bestowed with land, gold and the Warlord's respect in the form of tea with QIN at 20 paces. This is highly rare as no one is allowed within 100 paces of QIN for fear of assassination.

BROKEN SWORD and FALLING SNOW are the duo that stormed QIN's palace three years earlier with intent to kill QIN, but BROKEN SWORD abandoned the mission at the last instant when his sword sliced a small section QIN's skin on the neck.What unfolds after that, I'll let the viewers watch and digest.

436,rj0900,Simply Exquisite...,10,7 September 2004,"Having been dragged to the theatre by my wife to see 'Hero', I halfway expected it to be yet another martial arts two-hour time waster. Lord, was I wrong! This was, without any doubt, the single most stunning movie I've seen in a month of sundays. On many fronts. Jet Li plays 'Nameless' an assassin, deadly at 10 paces, sent to kill the emperor of Qin, a despot who uses whatever means available, including murder and pillage, to unite his country. 'Flying Snow' (Maggie Cheung), 'Sky' (Donnie Yen) and 'Broken Sword' (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) are the Emperor's enemies whom Nameless must kill in order to win the Emperor's trust so that he can get close to him. But things get even more complicated because while Flying Snow is sworn to the Emperor's demise, Broken Sword, her lover, must stop her.Visually (bowing to the fact that the story always takes a back seat to the visuals with American audiences), Hero was beyond breathtaking! Zhang Yimou treads dangerously the line between narrative and art, allegory and realism with this one. How he accomplished many of the effects, so seamlessly composed that even a jaded movie goer like myself was left gasping, I'll be considering for years to come. I'd love to try to describe what I saw and experienced, but I simply couldn't do it justice. Suffice to say, if you're a Special Effects aficionado, they alone makes this movie a truly worthwhile experience. On the other hand, if you happen to enjoy a movie with an intelligent plot, fully realized characters and a wagonload full of passion, I can't think of a better movie to recommend. Hero is a visual symphony.",Hero
437,dsabverticus-1,Don't get too hyped up,2,19 November 2004,"With all the hype around for Quentin's new film, one would think that you would go and see it expecting the best. Like many of his films, this is another rated with superb reviews and such. Let me just say this is not a great movie. Once again Quentin grasps the ideals that children and young adults love, with corny and predictable results. This movie truly tried to be ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", but wasn't. Flying around, near to exact soundtrack, desert scenarios, an intense love story (that wasn't in this situation) and sword fights. It fails in nearly every category, amazingly crap fights, with the exception of Donnie Yen's early fight. The fights truly are horrid, and I am a major martial arts fan. Flying around etc. Like Jet's other recent films, I believe this will give Jet Li an even worse ""not the real deal, wire climbing martial artist"" look. The love story was rather bland and the soundtrack just sounded like a rip-off. Let me suggest why this movie is horrid:Terrible Fights, and thats what supposedly keep this movie interesting!Below-par story, While it is unique, as Quentin always tries, this time it was just too repetitive and uninteresting.Another attempt at being unique by Quentin that just goes too farI nearly fell asleep half-way through this movieAmazingly corny, and too old school, think ""Kung Fu Theater""I must however mention Crouching Tiger is a great movie, but Hero just tries too hard. So what was the goods of this movie? SOME nice scenarios, but wreaked by the story...the emperor of Qin wears nice armor, Jet Li is cool (but not in this movie). Seriously, if you are a child, you may enjoy this movie. It honestly appears to be written for kids. I honestly do not see how this can entertain adults who are modern movie-goers.2/10, ""Watchable, but dead crap""",Hero
438,Khrushchev,Movie is best enjoyed by a blindly patriotic Chinese person.,5,11 March 2005,"This movie had several flaws. One was that the fight scenes are excessive and not that well done because the fighters purposely miss attacking their opponents when they are open. They are more like dances, but do not strike that fine balance between dancing and fighting that the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon fight scenes did. Another major annoyance is the constant sad music and clothes flapping in the wind. Yes it is beautiful and inspiring at first, but gets tiring quickly. Simply put, this movie's action scenes and drama are overblown. However, I can live with pretentiousness. What sinks this movie for me is the ending, as well as the characterisation of the King of Qin.Now some will accuse me of being hard on a movie that is clearly fictional, but these people should remember the movie is based on real world events. What gets me is that the emperor is portrayed as this noble, wise man who is brutal but only for the greater good. I don't know Chinese history very well, but I am almost certain the real King of Qin was not like that. He was probably a brutal and power-hungry tyrant just like the other conquerors of history. Of course the further back these events happened, the less brutal they seem and the more they get romanticised. We should not fall for it. To illustrate the point, just imagine a movie made about Stalin in 50 years or so portraying him as a wise and noble man who had to kill millions of Russians and Ukrainians for the greater good of industrialising the Soviet Union and subsequently winning the Second World War (the Soviet Union won most of the war). Would such a movie not want to make you puke? A similar argument is made at the end of this movie: that the King of Qin united China, thus saving it from conquering hordes that China could have never resisted if divided. To me it does not excuse this vulgar propaganda.Like another reviewer wrote, I bet the Chinese commissars are very happy about this movie. It probably supports their rationalisations that their brutal suppression of dissidents is for the greater good of China.For all you patriotic viewers (any of you, whether Chinese, American, British...), I urge you to reconsider your devotion to the state. Things are almost never as simple as you think.By the way, my user name has no relevance to my politics whatsoever. I have just found the name Khrushchev to be funny ever since I watched a certain Family Guy episode.",Hero
439,dnguyen1215,"Roshomon flashbacks, solid acting",9,6 March 2008,"I think that this movie is Jet Li's finest work. The story is told through flashbacks, with color schemes representing the most violent, the most romantic, and the truth. Jet Li, who was originally supposed to play Li Mu Bi in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, plays a protagonist known simply as Nameless. He is sent to see the King of Qin after vanquishing three of the kingdom's most deadly assassins. through flashbacks, we are able to see the story from the most violent perspective, the most romantic perspective, and from the truth. The color schemes used are red, blue, and white, respectively. The movie is very well acted and the fight scene between Jet Li and Donnie Yen is pretty cool. Overall, an excellent movie. Bravo!",Hero

Everithing, the landscapes, the struggles, show us something very different that we are used to watch in occidental filmmakers. Even if it's considered a ""commercial movie"", shows us a little part of the oriental spirituality expressed as calm and beauty, just by the rhythm that the movie shows and the harmony between all it's elements.However, the final part, beside I found it disappointing, I think it's offensive for the viewers of this piece of art. It's like the Commmunist Party wanted to take advantage of the film an ends it with a pathetic message of the ""Union of a great Nation"", which is everything an official lie and a way to justify the sacrifice of millions of people towards the construction of a ""Modern China"".",Hero

That's this movie in a nut shell. Made to look pretty, but the fire shown in the fight scenes in ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" isn't here. In fact the fights all look and feel astonishingly staged to the point that you are rolling your eyes. The performances are over-dramatic. Example: Jet Li is fighting another guy on a lake (and I mean on it, they're jumping off the water) and a drop of water from their fight lands on the body of the guy's dead lover, so this guy ignores Jet Li only to run over to his lover's body and wipe the drop away while looking mournful. That's not deep, that's asinine. The shallow depth of all the characters is attempted to be concealed by fancy dialogue and incomprehensible actions by the characters. Overall weak, and over-dramatic.",Hero

After seeing the comment 'possibly the most beautiful film ever made' I thought even though it was a Chinese martial arts film maybe it'd be okay. HA. I sat through 99 minutes of rubbish.For a start the plot was very complicated, although I did understand it, but it was absolute rubbish! In one bit these people died, then it flashed back and they died again in a different way...Also, the fight scenes were pathetic, apart from the big battle with all the archers which was pretty cool, but the one on ones where they run on water and fly just doesn't appeal to me .Really I hated it, in my opinion it is one of the worst films ever made, but, lots of people do like it, so, if you are a fan of this sort of film I guess you should go and see it, but if your a fan of me don't. :)",Hero

I can see a lot of meanings that the director puts in.

445,Mashi69,A harmless fable with lovely colors,5,4 April 2006,"I'm perhaps biased because I don't like overusing unrealistic battle scenes in the manner some Hong Kong-China-Taiwan directors have been doing these late 10 years or so. It's OK: realism is not the goal of a the-making-of-a-nation movie. But even wearing a pair of reality-filtering glasses I cannot be unaware that repetition and exaggeration are part of the common lexicon of parody, and I don't think Yimou's intention was to sketch a parody. All the opposite, he's damn serious.Even the fables we were told as babies, though unrealistic by nature, had some limits: they used an imaginary setting to convey a real-life teaching, but the stress was always on the teaching. Would you have the wolf blow off a dozen houses and hunt down a dozen piggies before being defeated? Or let Pinocchio's nose become half a mile long when he lies? And would you have Aladdin find three magic lamps instead of one? Just useless. So, for me 60 minutes of impossible fighting on a 90-minute movie is definitely a redundant thing.Nor I do find interesting or provocative at all its simple moral ""the ultimate good must tolerate some temporary evil"": we've been living thousands, dozen thousands, hundred thousands of years of ""ultimate good"", is it not enough to consider it just as temporary as that evil which is supposed to justify it? People fight to impose their ideals of good to other people, there is nothing provocative in this, just inescapable. Perhaps, we might say, today it is much less inescapable and when armies export democracy there's a good deal of other reasons along with the ""ultimate good"".Not much else to say. I don't know enough about the ""martial arts"" movie canon but I suspect this one just don't aim at being a super-mega-kung fu movie; as well as I know enough of the taoist principles to realize that here they have been used in a flat and shallow way, so this is not a philosophical movie either. Must we really conclude that this is a movie about heroism? I fear the answer is yes. But since I hold Yimou in high esteem, I hope the nameless hero is just a way to quote those nameless heroes who have died by the millions crushed by Chinese communism (this for what regards the ""ultimate good"" part), even though there are not enough signs in the movie to justify such an interpretation.And it's OK, but I sincerely would have preferred if in the end Yimou had respected at least the complexity he seems to infuse in the king of Qin during the movie, by highlighting his grief for the rough and merciless mechanism that leads civilization forward cutting down the passions and the ideals of the individuals. All that is left of this issue is the nameless hero's hint when he whisper into the king's ears (""remember the people who will die""). What I liked most is the dual being formed by the actions of Broken Sword and Flying Snow, that well exemplifies the contradictory pulses which live side by side in everyone of us, a complexity that cannot survive to the final judgment of decisions.So, a feeble-boned film, but what a fantastic skin! The movie is a real visual experience and stars those Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung who, for the habitués of oriental cinema, have a value added deriving from movies standing on a higher ground than this one (see ""In the mood for love"", ""2046"").",Hero
446,robertbmtan,A Wuxia masterpiece with extraordinary screenplay and action scenes,10,6 September 2017,"If I had to describe this film in one word, it would be ""surreal"". In all honesty, I wouldn't even classify this as a historical fiction film, it fits more as a fantasy film, but I'll explain that later.From the very beginning to the very end, this film has little dialogue between characters, yet the film still has an extremely interesting and complicated plot. The suspense and mystery elements of the plot are expertly crafted with just the right mix of probable yet unsuspecting. Without spoiling too much of the film, I will just say that the plot keeps viewers engaged from beginning to end. The moral ambiguities of the characters allow viewers to generate their own interpretations and understandings of the plot as it goes, which is atypical of most Wuxia films. The plot of this film isn't one of those ""good guy beats up bad guys"" films or ""saving the damsel in distress"". The protagonist and the antagonist (so to speak) are both just fighting for their country, but the theme reveals something much larger. Although some people may argue that the plot was being overly dramatic, unrealistic, and too cheesy, I would say that the plot plays perfectly to the fantasy-like historical setting and surreal action.Moving on to the characters - as I said, this film contains very little dialogue, while perfectly building each character's classiness, mysteriousness, and frankly just their coolness. Again, some may argue that these characters are way too unrealistic and cliché, but as a Wuxia film, these characters, again, fit perfectly. Where each character has their flaws, we all get a sense that these people are above human in almost every way, and that's what the director wants us to feel. These Wuxia have been training for their entire lives, and ARE above us in a godly way, making the film that much more satisfying.Of course, this film isn't known for its characters and plot, but rather the action and environment. While many Chinese films feature cheesy acting and low budget settings, this film creates a truly epic feeling rivaling that of Saving Private Ryan. The action is truly satisfying with actors the likes of Jet Li and Donnie Yen playing badass roles. And this film takes it to the next level with high budget action scenes that feel surreal from beginning to end - it's everything I've ever wanted in Wuxia action scenes. And finally, the setting of this film is absolutely stunning. Almost every single scene is worthy of being screenshotted and set as a wallpaper. The film captures the complete beauty of nature (presumably during the Warring Kingdoms in China) with the colors of every scene reflecting the tone of the film. I really can't say much more other than this film is an artistic masterpiece - see for yourself. The blend of colors by using the tone of the scene, the props, the clothing, and the scenery itself in every single setting always creates a harmonic and surreal experience for the viewers. If anything, I would highly encourage you to watch it just based on the cinematography. I haven't seen anything like it, not even in the Grand Budapest Hotel or the Secret Life of Walter Mitty - perhaps due to the oriental and historic setting, but nevertheless it's a truly extraordinary experience.I rate this film a 10/10 not because I think it's flawless (it has a few continuity issues and the pacing isn't exactly amazing), but because it's a Wuxia masterpiece unlike anything else I've seen. I'm a sucker for cinematography and action so that itself deserves a 10/10, but with an amazing plot as well, it's one of the top films I've ever recommended.",Hero

I do not think I have seen something quite this beautiful before - something kept my attention riveted throughout the movie, but, unfortunately, it had nothing to do with the storyline itself.The colours, the choice of actors, the clothing, the scenery, the composition - all of these things are, in my eyes, flawless. I nearly wept, in truth, at several points due not to the acting itself, but because the movie was so stunningly beautiful. Some of you might see where I am going with this:It is the most beautiful movie I have seen. But where the beauty is inspiring, the plot is a little less than so. I found myself longing for more depth in the characters, or depth in the plot itself. It was wonderfully told, but to a degree, shallow. I am not saying that I found the plot 'bad' or 'lacklustre', just that in comparison to the masterpiece given to us through the visual and auditory senses, it is weak. I wish that it had not been cropped down by half an hour - I have a feeling that if it had not been, I would have loved it far more. As it is, it feels as if though I find compassion for the characters only because they are beautifully presented, not because they're given anything beyond surface value.I would have liked to have seen a little further into them and I would have enjoyed more focus on the people rather than the scenery.All in all, it's getting a 4.5 out of 5 in my book.

The musical score is haunting and sweetly sad, just like the story - pay close attention to everything. Direction, cinematography, editing - all sharp and flawless.

452,uhasson,Somewhat hyped..,7,16 January 2005,"We would give this movie a 6.5, no more than that. Maybe less. What did we enjoy? The story, which is beautiful, and *spoilers* roughly, is told in a few different ways. What didn't we like? A lot of the meaning (for the viewer) here seems to be in developing ideas from similar films such as crouching tiger. While this works for the film fans, we suspect that for people who see ""Hero"" as a stand-alone project, such meanings will be lost. And in that case, what are we left with? 1. The fighting scenes in this film were exaggerated. 2. The character of the young-woman warrior (Moon) didn't really play any role. Seemed that her presence in the movie was meant to capture some viewers who remembered her from crouching tiger / hidden dragon. As some commented, the sex scene with her did not contribute anything to the film. Neither do her fight scenes. In particular, the one where she fights Flying Snow amongst the falling leaves was ridiculous. This scene seemed bent on infusing emotion into the viewer in a very explicit way  reminded me of Fleetwood Mac's music  just tries too hard to infuse you with emotion. 3. In general, it seemed that all the good motives in crouching tiger were taken to an extreme here  the flying scenes, walking on water scenes etc' simply don't play any important role here. As far as Jet-Li films go, our favorites are clearly his earlier, non-westernized works  Fist of Legend, Last Hero in China, The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk (Truly amazing film!),",Hero
453,ocha015,Visual piece of art,7,21 September 2006,"I have never been very keen on watching Chinese films. Hovever, I was told that this film would surprise me, and, it is true. It shows the story of a man who killed several assassins that wanted to kill the King of one of the seven territories in which China was divided.This plot leads us into several flashbacks, that play with different colors and songs, making the film visually attractive. Dividing the different theories in colors was a very good idea. On top of that, I like the actors, particularly Jet Li, who has done the best film in his career.However, as in many other Chinese films, the plot is too repetitive (as the one in ""House of flying daggers""), and if it wasn't for the artistic spectacle, the film must have been much shorter. I believe that not knowing the Chinese culture might make you loose some details, but the film could have had a better script.So, to sum up, I must say that this film is a visual spectacle that could have been one of the best films n history if it was accompanied by a better script.",Hero
454,potteries,Creepy film and creepy reviewers,1,4 July 2006,"There are things that people must understand when we look at a film like this - the historical background and its significance in its current political and cultural settings.So first thing first - who is the King of Qin (later the Qin Emperor)? He was (and still is) a highly controversial character from over two thousands years ago, who is notable for unifying China but also someone vilified throughout Chinese history for his cruelty and brutality in the pursuit of his objective. He can be regarded as a the founder of the country called China (the English word ""China"" is often thought to be derived from the word ""Qin""), but the dynasty he founded collapsed rapidly after his death due to widespread civil revolt as a result of the hatred for his regime.What is his significance at present time in China? The Qin Emperor was hated throughout much of Chinese history, but attempts were made to rehabilitate his reputation in recent times, most notably by Chairman Mao during the 1970's. To the Chinese, historical justification of a political regime is important; and Mao, before his death, was concerned about his reputation after his death and made a conscious attempt to justify his totalitarian and brutal regime. Thus the Qin Emperor was praised for the destruction of division in favour of unification (note that this is the point made by the film), and that his brutality was justified as necessary in difficult times. In fact the criticism of him was that he wasn't ""totalitaran"" enough, perhaps in retrospect that is something that Mao was able to outdo the Qin Emperor. This image of the good dictatorship despite the great evils done is one that the current inheritor of Mao's China is keen to maintain.The Qin Emperor is therefore not just an interesting historical figure, but someone who embodies the mindset of the ruling elite of present day China. And we can therefore understand this film in term of the political and cultural context of the current regime in China (the film has the full approval of the Government of PR China). It tells us that division means violence (therefore there can be no independent Tibet or Taiwan), and to ensure peace there has to be single dictatorship and state violence is necessary, furthermore individuals must be prepared to sacrifice themselves to achieve such end.The easiest way for non-Chinese to understand this is to imagine of something that never happened - the unification of Europe by Nazi Germany (this is not an unreasonable comparison as the Qin Emperor had in China before Mao's revisionism about the same reputation as Hitler). To ensure peace in Europe, you should argue that there must be no separate nation states in Europe, and brutality is necessary to ensure peace. Peace is the be all and end all, even if as can see that in fact there has been relative peace in Western Europe after the Second World War with the separate nation states still intact.And from this we can see from this how creepy some of the reviewers are. One guy from Germany argued that we should forget about the politics and just concentrate on the beauty of the film. Just imagine saying that about Leni Riefenstahl's ""Triumph des Willens"", strange that it should come from a German. One guy argued that it is about peace, and unification is necessary to ensure it. But we can see that this is a completely bogus argument when we look at history (unified Qin collapsed in violence quickly, while Europe remains in relative peace as separate nation states). One guy from the US argued that, unlike the self-centredness of Western culture, people in Chinese expect to make sacrifice for the greater good. Well, tell that to the Chinese people living in US that they should be prepared to sacrifice their human rights for the good of the US government and see how far you will get.Other reviewers stated that the film is not totally sympathetic to the Qin Emperor as it showed him losing control (he cannot pardon Nameless, and must execute Nameless because his bureaucrats think he must). This makes the message of the film even worse - you should sacrifice your life for a totalitarian state effectively ruled by faceless and heartless bureaucrats? I can't imagine anything worse.It is, in all, a creepy film with a creepy message, supported by some creepy reviewers. Sad to see this listed among the top 250 films in IMDb.",Hero

456,eskjellum,A visual masterpiece and a powerful message,10,30 November 2003,"This film is bound to be compared to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. You can tell by reading the other comments. Its visual style is similar. However ""Hero"" takes it even further with an astonishing colour palette that is not there for visuals alone, it serves as a metaphor for the mood and the events of any given scene. The cinematography is astounding, far beyond anything that Hollywood has ever produced. My sincere opinion is that this film dwarfs pretty much ANY Hollywood production that ever was, and it is with great joy I realize that somewhere in the world people are still into making good films, not run-of-the-mill cashcows.I register that many people feel the storyline is weak and that the message is bad - that it is a pro-imperial piece of propaganda. This saddens me. One has to have an understanding of the profound philosophical and spiritual schools that are actually the real protagonists of this film. The film of the hero and the assassins is nothing but a subplot. I'm only a little familiar with Taoism, which I'm sure is well represented in this film, but what I read into it is the Buddhadharma. I am a Buddhist and this film struck me on so many levels that it left me in awe.Essentially this film is an epic masterpiece and the teachings of the Buddha combined. It represents an understanding of life that is very alien to us in the west. Its message being that the suffering of one (""Me"") is insignificant to the suffering of the many and that the only thing with the potential to conquer the eternal threat of evil is the practice of universal compassion. The film (specifically the character ""Broken Sword"") describes egolessness and that by loving your enemy, he becomes your friend. True, people may feel that the actual conclusion of the film may invalidate this notion, but then you need to look deeper. To me this selfless message is Truth and I struggle every day to overcome the ignorance that this film attacks.However, I can understand how many people find this very notion offensive, and see it as immoral. We are after all human beings and we are all victims of the extreme ignorance and folly of our own minds. One has only to turn on the television to see this - we do indeed live in a Dark Age.This film, seen in the right frame of mind, has the capacity to open your heart and inspire you. On a more superficial level, it's just a damn good 90 minutes. Don't let it pass you by.",Hero
457,jyohockey93,"Close Contender Of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon",8,23 December 2006,"This movie was a great movie for Zhang Yimou to start his career. The martial arts in this movie are great and at the same time tells a story of controversy. Jet Li's swordplay is brilliant (seen in first fight with famous martial artist/actor Donnie Yen who also matches Jet Li's skill with the sword with his spear). Also, surprising skill from Tony Yeung with such a short sword. Stunning cinematography especially with the color theme with each different part of the movie. A must see for all action movie lovers with an actually good plot. And if you don't get it at first, watch it again and you will, that way you get to see all of the great battles over again. A well done movie that is has Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon running for its money.",Hero
458,luke_xf,"Despite succumbing to Miramax's scissors, still an amazing movie not be missed",10,25 March 2003,"The long awaited epic from art house director Zhang Yimou is finally available on DVD. Alas, American fans can finally get their hands this martial arts masterpiece that has shattered box office records in China. Despite a few shortcomings, Hero is a moving tale that will surly entertain, inspire, and teach.Hero easily has to be the most visually stunning movie I have ever seen. Zhang has created a movie that flows like a painting rather than a stream of celluloid. There are images and shots in here that easily can move people to tears.The acting is top-notch and even Li who has been so limited in his American roles comes with a subtle, yet moving performance. My favorite performance however, was Chen Dao ming, who played the king.The music is incredible with heartwrenching violin solos, angelic harmonies, and a little throwback to the Peking Opera(though I would have appreciated if composer Tan Dun would have tried a bit harder to make it sound different than Crouching tiger which he also composed). The music elevates so many of the scenes to levels that cannot be achieved otherwise.The only complaint I have is that the characters are a bit underdeveloped. While, it's true that this is a result of Miramax demanded that Zhang reduce the film's running length since the original cut ""moved too slow"", it can't be ignored. There are good characters here, however, if you blink you will miss crucial characterizations that severely diminish any three-dimensional aspects to them.The film will draw unnecessary comparisons to Crouching tiger, hidden dragon (which I believe is slightly inferior to Hero). Both are Wuxia movies and the similarities end there. While CTHD told a Western style tale of romance, Hero instead tells an Eastern tale of honor, determinism, and what makes someone a hero.",Hero
459,luke_xf,Why this is a work of art...,10,8 April 2003,"Hero is inarguably a visual masterpiece. However, it's art runs deeper than just the surface. There are so many movies that hold you by the hand the whole movie and synthesize your feelings for you. The creators have already decided how you should feel when, where, and why throughout the whole movie.
But not Hero. They have crafted a movie where it is completely up to the viewer how they feel and what they take from the movie. The story is told so delicately and so subtly that you'll never realize it. In the end, it's completely up to the viewer what they take away: who is the ""hero""?  What is the message of Hero? What makes a hero? It's not predetermined. Sure the director has his own opinion, but you'll never hear it because that's not what he's trying to do.Granted, you could argue that every movie is up to the viewer how they feel and what they take, but when you talk to the writers, they would most certainly give you a narrow look on the emotions and meanings of that film.Art should be subjective and open to a range of interpretation. People should be able to take a work of art and personalize it. Hero is a rare film that achieves this.",Hero
460,jrdorris,Brilliant,10,11 March 2004,"I was expecting a lot from this film.  After all it boasts an incredible cinematographer, perhaps the greatest of Chinese directors, two of film's premiere martial artists, and some of China's best actors.  Being an American my anticipation has been heightened over a year of theatrical postponements.  I even thought of buying the DVD on the internet.  Last week, I found a rental copy at a video store and immediately grabbed it. I was not disappointed.  It was the most beautifully shot film that I've seen, the culmination of Doyle's talents.  Though I don't think that all of the credit is his.  After all, Yimou was a cinematographer before he was a director, and his innate sense of color and motion blended beautifully. For instance, take the GREEN scene of enlightenment, the falling curtains are very reminiscent of the dye shop in Ju Dou.  Some would argue the similarities with Crouching Tiger, but this is only applicable for western audiences.  There are some similar ""floating"" shots and panoramic flying scenes, and the score is done by Tan Dun.  The plot is very different though.  The story itself I believe is a combination of themes and styles from other fifth generation films like The Emperor and the Assassin and Ashes of Time.   The movie is also enhanced by some excellent martial arts choreography and swordplay.  Jet Li and Donnie Yen move very well together. For further evidence of this see their fight scenes in Hark Tsui's Once Upon a Time in China II.  In addition, you have the stoic beauty Maggie Cheung, who always pairs well with the multi-talented Tony Leung (ie In the Mood for Love).  Zhang Zhiyi rounds out the excellent cast.  Despite all of these good points, I have heard some criticism from individuals, all Americans, who dislike the ideology behind the movie.  I know that the concept of ""All under Heaven"" has been a sticking point, but it comes down to cultural differences.  Most Eastern cultures are collectivist.  The idea of sacrificing individuals for the greater good is not as distasteful.  In America, the general consensus is that no principle, no matter how lofty, is worth the sacrifice of an innocent life.  For the King of Qin and the other characters the unification of the six kingdoms, the end of inter-tribal warfare, was worth the loss of a few innocent lives.  For some people the idea of universal goals outweighing individual ones is difficult to swallow. For additional information on this and a better understanding of ""All under heaven"", there are many psychological studies and books comparing individualistic and collectivist cultures.  The important thing is not to judge what you don't fully understand, and beyond that enjoy the movie regardless of its ideology.  The bottom line is that this is a beautiful film, with an infinite line of positive qualities.  I'm very much looking forward to its theatrical release in the U.S.",Hero

The martial arts sequences are second to none. Nothing less of enthralling can be used to describe the swordplay that is even better than the Matrix Reloaded. In between the well crafted fight scenes is a tale told so eloquently through flashback sequences of events. To date, this is Jet Li's finest performance. Perhaps even an Oscar contender for best cinematography.You will be so enthralled in this movie that even you will forget about the subtitles. A must see for any martial arts or fan of well made films.",Hero
465,uzzman,"""Hero"": Visionary Meets the Technical",10,7 September 2004,"Technical virtuosity versus the eponymous creative vision. As modern movie buffs, we are usually dealt one or the other, but rarely both. The newer Star Wars episodes and to some extent, the Matrix films, tend to be heavy on the technical pyrotechnics, but tend to be short on the pure beauty of visionary cinematography. Movies like ""Amelie"" and ""Lost In Translation"" are marvels of the color aesthetic, but their technical brilliance is subtle. One of those rare films that merge the two is the new Jet Li driven vehicle, ""Hero"" (""Ying Xiong"").This eagerly anticipated film by Yimou Zhang has finally hit the U.S. theaters, even though it was actually released overseas in 2002. Much like its genre predecessor, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", this film shows off the martial art known as wuxia, which deals with swordplay. Both films could be referred to as ""wire-fu"" since both heavily use unseen wires to allow the actors to appear to float on air, hang by a foot and walk on water. The difference between the two seems to lie in the addition of Matrix-style freeze frame style effects fused with the brilliant color play that Zhang uses to create contrast between versions of events. The combination is truly evocative and yet is still able to maintain the film's sense of integrity to the time period.The cinematography and effects are truly the main characters in this film, but Jet Li turns in a quietly effective performance as Nameless, the hero of the epic tale that is part Greek tragedy and part ancient Chinese philosophy. In addition to Li, there are remarkable portrayals by Tony Leung Chiu Wai as the introspective assassin Broken Arrow and by the stunning Maggie Cheung as the tenacious Flying Snow. For all the dazzling effects, inventive cinematography and its quixotic script, ""Hero"" owes a lot to the legacy of Akira Kurosawa, the legendary Japanese director who created some of the greatest foreign epics of all-time. Much of the storytelling and scenes are straight out of some of Kurosawa's greatest works ""Rashomon"" and ""Ran"". Even though Zhang seems to liberally channel the spirit of Kurosawa through some elements, the remainder of the film is purely modern. The use of stop action and slow motion photography is probably a little overused, but the techniques do create a striking tableau of billowy dynamics. The one problem I had with the film lies with the actual use of the subtitles, which are obviously necessary, but it makes one look away from the vivid images that Zhang creates.If you are a fan of martial arts movies, epic tragedies or just a sucker for vibrant celluloid art, then you are in for a treat as ""Hero"" will appeal to all of you in some way. As for me...I cannot wait to see it again and catch all the things I missed!",Hero
466,stefano76,how could you enjoy it? and i thought i was open to oriental culture...,4,28 January 2005,"Take Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (CTHD), remove most of the delicate love story, get rid of any character deepness, leave only: oriental-way choreographic combats, including the usual flying people (but here totally unnatural and not always beautiful)self-pleased examples of oriental wisdom, logic, and ideals including honor: hardly understandable to an occidental person - self-pleased plot which is not really as such aspects of oriental culture which i had found more deeply analyzed in other Asian moviesdialogs which, at least in their English translation were not very excitingacting pushed to the extremes of inexpressiveness (can't blame the actors)BTW. Why the ""moral"" is from Machiavelli's Principe???? Is it supposed to be the oriental interpretation of European medieval age thoughts? The inner soul of the movie is that violence can be the best solution for peace? Did USA sponsor it??I used to think i was very open-minded, i loved CTHD, I adore Kar Wai Wong, I enjoyed Dolls and like most work of Takeshi Kitano; got in love with Drunk on Women and Poetry, without forgetting Kurosawa, etc.etc.But probably I was wrong, and apparently I just can't get into the deepness of the hong-kong/Chinese way of thinking: this must be why i am one of the very few ones who did not like this movie. I am just left with the question: WHAT FOR? I did not get any compelling photography, no extraordinary special effects, no interesting analysis of oriental culture.

467,Riku2003,How people see this movie differently,7,24 March 2003,"This movie has received very different kinds of feedback, some call it the best martial arts related movie ever, while others call it a bad attempt to make yet another Kung Fu movie. I am more towards the first. I think I look at the movie in a very different way, because I do Wushu, which is what most western people call Kung Fu. I will pull out a few examples from the movie and explain the way I look at them, and how it could be different from some ordinary person just looking for a good movie. THERE WILL BE A FEW SPOILERS.The martial arts scenes most of the time include some moves which are against the laws of gravity. This would seem totally ""fake, fake, fake"" as I have read many times, to a normal person who can't see beyond the jump or the spin the character is performing. Seeing beyond, basically means thinking of the jump as a metaphor, which represents the skill and the concentration of the person. Same with running on the water, it is trying to show you that the character has a skill far beyond any of ours. It is only a simple martial arts related metaphor.The scene where Sky and Nameless confront is another really good example. It must've seemed weird that they suddenly stopped their battle to have the old man play them music. They even payed him to. They mentioned that martial arts and music are very alike. The music inspires them to fight the battle before it actually takes place. It is another metaphor, just like the running on water etc. Haven't you ever worked better with music? It sometimes does help. By going through the fight in their minds they can compare each others skills too, and see what the opponent is capable of doing before they even really begin.My last example will be the calligraphy scenes. Remember the part where they talk about the 19 ways of writing the character: ""sword"". This is really true, in the old times they did have 19 ways of writing that character. Some people in the ancient days actually ""chose"" their own way to write it and used techniques related to their way of writing it. Nameless tries to seek Broken Sword's secret twentieth character to unlock his special skills in the techniques of straight sword. This is really interesting to me, because when I look at the character I start searching for the technique, and the way the technique is hidden is really incredible.It is an amazing movie which means a lot more to people who read Chinese and/or know Wushu/Kung Fu.",Hero
468,DarkOcean,"Great story, great acting, great movie",10,26 March 2003,"I just saw this movie yesterday and I'm just finished watching it for the second time. This movie is not about martial arts. It has a meaning that rises above all the swordplay and fighting. Ofcourse the fightscenes are one of a kind and are really fresh. Beautiful images, great cinematography, it has everything. but the thing that really gets me thinking is the story. i thought Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was sometimes a little boring, don't get me wrong I love that movie, but Hero is so much different it carries the true meaning of ""gung fu"". I also love how the movie changes from color, from red to blue and green, white and black, every color looks at the movie on different way and carries a different meaning. The acting is also topnotch. I saw the 98-minute version of the movie, but i heard there's also a 128-minute version...I have to see that one too.",Hero

It wasn't like watching a movie. It was more like watching someone's dream. The screen lit up with each frame. The beauty intended for this picture was depicted so intensely that it was actually pleasurable to watch. I looked forward to each scene.And the story line actually made me think (which doesn't happen a lot in an action film). I was drawn into the writer's vision. I was truly amazed.

I have trouble feeling qualified to comment on the acting, since I saw it with English subtitles, but if I did feel qualified, I would say their performances were flawless.  I will be watching everything by the director that I can get my hands on.A few times, though, I did think, ""How could anyone see this movie and think, 'Hey, we oughta buy all the distribution rights to this, chop it up, and sell our version to Americans!'""  (I saw a preview to the American version before Kill Bill Vol. 2, and nearly threw something at the screen.

471,Cedrus,Disappointing,3,21 January 2005,"I had been waiting for at least a year when I went to see ""hero"". So maybe I was expecting too much, because it really was a disappointment to me. I don't know if the dubbing was part of the problem. When I watched ""crouching tiger,..."", I saw it in Chinese with English subtitles. But this time, the film was dubbed in English, and I can't stress enough on how bad it was. All the dramatic scenes were overplayed, and because of that, the movie theater broke into laughter on many occasions during scenes which were supposed - I think - to be dramatic. And the translation didn't help either. I mean the English-dubbed script doesn't sound of Chinese origin, at least in martial arts movies. It sounded like a parody.As for the fight scenes, well I don't want to keep comparing to ""crouching tiger,..."", but the director seemed to be over-stressing on the artistic side of it while wasting much of the substance. I understand that the color theme of each scene was on purpose and it was related to each version of the story told by either ""nameless"" or the king, but this was too distracting to really enjoy those scenes.Regarding the actors, ""Jet Li"" was plain and unimpressive as usual. ""Maggie Cheung"" was good, and ""Zhang Ziyi""'s role was useless; at least how her acting made it seem to be. Again, I never really thought that dubbing a movie could pretty much ruin it, so I think I'd have to watch it in its original version so I could make a clear opinion about it, but for now I'll give it a 3/10.",Hero

The use of the different color schemes, although not exactly subtle, was visually stunning.I know some people complained about all the ""flying"" around in the movie. However, that is how these Chinese martial arts novels have been written for centuries and thus became an integral part of these type of movies for over some 50 - 60 years.  Besides, no one is complaining about how Luke Skaywalker did some gravity defying moves in the ""Star War"" movies... which by the way has a lot of parallels to these old martial arts movies, minus the space ships of course.POSSIBLE SPOILER: By the way, in the Chinese culture the color white is associated with death and is the color people used to wear to funerals in the old days.",Hero
478,rcropperUK,The best martial arts film ever made,10,24 February 2004,"Rarely have I been so astounded by such a magnificent, awe-inspiring film. If you have not yet placed your eyes on this masterpiece of Chinese cinema then I cannot recommend this film highly enough. 'Hero' is by far the best Chinese film I have ever seen, and already a firm favourite of all time.The imagery is unparallelled, simply draw-droppingly near perfect scenes, with bold and vibrant use of colour, symbolism and scenery. The fluent flow of the storyline, the delicate direction of the sword slicing action, the Chinese cultural concepts and the emotionally charged scenes between characters combine to produce a simply remarkable achievement. This film has a few elements from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but is far, far superior in every way. The sleek direction from Yimou Zhang is so perfectly done, just imagine two martial arts experts ensuing in battle against each other, defying the laws of physics as we know it, and yet following them in 360 degrees in slow motion as one deflects a droplet of rain from one sword to the other, at the same time spinning and leaping over water... simply beautiful. The attack sequences are also superbly set, with hundreds of thousands of the King's warriors in formation, simultaneously firing enough arrows into the city which literally cover the sky, in addition to the viewer being able to watch the journey of a single arrowhead aimed during this event. The build up to the attack along with the unnerving tune of a Chinese stringed instrument help you, as the audience, to become firmly engrossed in your seat. The individual martial arts is also second to none, for myself particularly to see the distant shots of the whole battle sequence showing the true skills involved with fighting, such as footwork, perfect timing,aggression, counter attacks and defence. Jet Li shows he is truly the grand daddy of martial arts. I cannot stress enough how much you need this film in your life. The colourful imagery imposed by the director will take your breath away with luscious, vivid, bright, wind-blown,draped backgrounds as the setting for the important progression of the story. Even the story itself is brought to the audience in such a way which ensures your undivided attention, as there are twists in the tales and hidden plots which do not develop until the end of the film.Even short individual scenes are memorable due to their sheer awesome display of skill and speed. This film even holds a political message which is relevant to all times, especially in today's American-lead world dominance. This film has absolutely everything - including an extremely sexy young Ziyi Zhang who simply is the biggest hype to come out of china since SARS. This film was released in 2002, but this is certainly one of my all time favourites and will probably be the best film I see all year. I have never been more enthusiastic to pursue films in this genre in my life. For more action type enthusiasts who like more gore and violence check out 'Ong Bak', but for people who appreciate a fuller, visionary piece of martial arts filming, this will leave you speechless.",Hero

480,the_hurricane15,Stunning,10,28 August 2004,"I saw this movie last night when it first opened up in Canada, and I must say that throughout the duration of this film I was mesmerized. The use of colour to show different perspectives (although not an original idea) is used to perfection as it gives the scene more depth and meaning. I walked into the theatre knowing that the cinematography was supposed to be good, so I had high expectations. By the end of the film, i was practically speechless. And this is just the cinematography. The martial arts (although perceived as somewhat slow) is amazing. All of the actors fight almost flawlessly, with such grace and poise. It is amazing as to how each fight scene was made, as it goes to incredibly fast at times (at least in my opinion). Now I am a huge Tarantino fan (but in no way will I compare the 2 directors) and I can see where he has adopted a lot of his visual styles from.A forewarning to anyone going to see the movie: There are subtitles, so if you do not like reading what everyone is saying, this may be a little tough to watch.Lastly, I will comment on the storyline. The story starts out fairly simple. But it gradually gets harder to grasp. Now I believe that I understood what they were trying to say (although I could be wrong) but I will admit that it can be a little hard to understand.

Amazing colours, vivid photography, wonderful martial arts. But, it is surprisingly boring and the suspense in discovering the meaning at the end just collapses.If nothing was said about this and someone watched in by accident, they would have enjoyed it more- especially if they had not seen ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""- now comparing this to the former, it certainly is no masterpiece and now Crouching Tiger, in my opinion, should be elevated as a consequence.Back to watching Jet Li's other movies such as ""The One"" and ""Kiss of the Dragon"" I think....",Hero
482,MovieCouple,"Beautiful, but far too bland",6,20 September 2004,"I was really shocked and let down by the IMDb.com rating system this time around. I actually talked the wife into going to see this movie based on the 8.2 IMDb.com rating, and we were both extremely let down.Before you assume we are just another pair of idiot ""Hollywood"" film fans, we aren't. In fact, we appreciate nothing less than a refreshing and well done movie, from script to film. We enjoy movies like Memento, as well as films like Crouching Tiger, Lord of the Rings, etc.When I saw the 8.2 rating, I got quite excited, a rating usually reserved for movies that brought something original, exciting or wonderful to the table, like Jaws, A Clockwork Orange, The Wizard of Oz, The Sting, 2001, Finding Nemo and Annie Hall.We both found this movie visually beautiful. The camera work and effects were amazing. The fight scenes were well done, but it's standard stuff you've seen before (not as good as Crouching Tiger in my opinion). In fact, it almost seems like a complete ripoff of Crouching Tiger as far as the combination of dancing and people hanging on strings to fly around in (almost silly) slow motion.As for the characters ... you can almost tell they are all solid/fine actors, but their characters border on being hollow and completely out of touch. You cannot relate to any of these characters at all, with the exception of the relationship between Broken Sword and Flying Snow, which at times borders on being interesting (those times are short lived).Then you have the character of Sky, who is introduced early on, has one or two lines and becomes extinct from the movie early on.The character of Moon is puzzling and annoying, as she serves no real purpose. I largely wonder if she (Ziyi Zhang) was inserted simply because she is a ""hot item"" in the Asian cinema these days ... there is even a small gratuitous sex scene with her involved as Broken Sword's servant. Neither myself nor the wife understood what the heck she was doing in the movie, aside from a few overly melodramatic screams, cries and sword scenes.Some of the fight scenes were so silly that the wife started laughing out loud in the theater. You know that ""I feel embarrassed for the movie"" kind of feeling that you hate, where you start to feel like people are going to get up and walk out on the film? Yeah, that feeling. Two guys in a sword fight that keep stabbing the tips of their swords into a lake simply because it looks good on film visually, but with no real purpose.Basically this was like an old low-budget Bruce Lee film, with the same stone-like uncharismatic characters and facial expressions, but mix in some beautiful cinematography and some downright strange behavior. If you remove the exceptional art work, the film struggles to even be mediocre. With the advent of effects, I give it a 6/10 rating, and will certainly never see it again.Would love to see this film crew work with a better script though.",Hero
483,clarke_ryan,am i alone on this one????,5,12 September 2004,"i was a huge fan of crouching tiger hidden dragon, and am a huge fan of many other Japanese sword films. but when watching Hero, i was almost laughing aloud in the theatre. don't get me wrong, the movie was full of stunning cinematic shots that blew me away. it had some great concepts and ideas. and some of the fights were done quite well. but aside from these few things i liked, it was filled with either direction mistakes a 19 year film student wouldn't even let happen, or complete rip offs of hidden dragon.i could not possibly write out every mistake i caught after one viewing of Hero, but i'll name a few. From crossing the line of action. a guy trapped with a spear on his chest on the ground then 2 quick cuts later he's out of frame safe from danger. Yimou Zhang tying to make a new graceful style of the matrix's famous bullet time(please everybody just leave bullet time alone, and stop doing it). the forbidden city full of monks and soldiers from wall to wall, but in the opening shot you can clearly see there are only 3 rows of monks with blank white space behind them, due to a lazy vfx director thinking no one would notice. now most people might have not caught all these things and frankly to me, a few mistakes here and there will not make or brake it. but this just shows how this Yimou Zhang guy isn't even in the same ball park as ang lee. taking short cuts to save costs, and just denying so many major rules of film making will make the whole movie suffer. going into this movie i thought it was done by ang lee, then afterwards i was told it wasn't just by the same producer of hidden dragon. i felt Hero is another case of some stupid producer trying to make money off the success of another one of his films by hiring a new director getting a new script but keeping the ideas, cinematics, and vision the same. i have never seen this work before and it didn't work here either. i felt this whole movie was full of take offs from ang lee's master piece. i also felt it was way to over ambitious, every shot was so drawn out and held so long as though he was trying to build a lot of suspense. but the whole movie is a narration and we know who lives or dies next, so there can't be any suspense. if we know there's no one behind the door, it would be dumb to set up a shot to look like we didn;t. i believe a lot of people will come out thinking its a very boring film because of this. the dialogue was alright, but just dragged on to long.heres a suggestion to all film makers out there. its cool to take the style and ideas of one movie and use it in another, but the next one better be unique in its own ways as well. i'm giving it a 5.6.",Hero

If you don't have much experience in Chinese history or culture and values the final act of the movie may confuse some. The music is the movies weak point, the loud drums by Kodo can be somewhat distracting. The fight scene above the lake is the films highlight imo, the swords dip into the water like a painter dipping his paintbrush into paint, the fight scenes are literally like art. IMO this movie is on par with CTHD and exceeds it in cinematography easily, this movie deserves a U.S. uncut theatrical release.",Hero

Went with some family members and basically it was the same. The water scene was too much for them. Sure I wish filmmakers the best, it's not easy to put things together. Subtitles, sometimes came and disappeared quickly without getting a real chance to read them. Sometimes reading the subtitles took away from the action that was going on.

486,iguana1500,Another Great Zhang YiMou Film,10,2 July 2004,"Many of Zhang Yi Mou's films are artistic in their portrayal of often very simple messages. While the plot of Hero is intriguing and even sometimes confusing (seeing it twice or three times clarifies), Zhang keeps the message to a point and still places heavy emphasis on creating beauty. Like a masterful artist, he relies on a wide range of media to create his masterpiece: from simple dialogue (two words in the end) to majestic scenes (of rocky desert mostly) and (quite simply) a lot of color. Some of his other films such as The Road Home and Red Sorghum also share these similarities. Hero pushes a very simple idea and yet takes a very intricate path of telling it. Never is any scene overly emotional, nor is any scene forced. Although many scenes are seemingly repeated, they are never the same and sometimes seem to contradict what already happened. Most people I know who have seen this movie felt it was confusing the first time around. Once they saw it twice, they all agreed that the movie flows flawlessly until the end.Hero also has one of the greatest soundtracks of any Zhang movie, rivaling that of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon's Soundtrack. Dun Tan lends his skills to the soundtracks of both movies. While the two OST's cannot be directly compared, I would prefer listening to the OST of Hero anyday.Overall Score: 10/10 - No complaints here",Hero
487,bgar,Makes a person feel good about power,6,19 January 2005,"Basically, the way I felt about this movie is that while it was beautiful to watch, and thrilling in its tribute to human skill and ability, in the end it amounted to a justification for statehood and dominion.In other words, it's stylistically captivating, but one should remain clued to the ideological message being conveyed. To accept this film part and parcel one must disregard logic and justice and a few other things relating to a healthy disdain for those in power. By harnessing the ethos of pacifism, the spirit of enlightenment, and the aura of human excellence to advance the idea of dominion, cloaked in a message of peace, it makes a bad idea seem good. Namely, that peace and unity can or should be obtained by the use of force by one people over another.Some people may condemn this movie as ""Communist"" propaganda, but I think it is much more in line with the ideology of the West than anything to do with socialism, or China for that matter ;)",Hero

I always feel like I'm watching more of a beautiful ballet then an action movie, the movement is so smooth, perfect, precise, and had meaning. This was right up there with ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". This movie is a must see, specially if you like traditional Chinese martial-arts cinema. Not the bastardized versions America puts out, low-grade knock-offs that they are. All violence and no story or heart. However as I always say, Make up your own mind. Don't listen to all those people that whine and complain about everything, most of the time they don't know what they're talking about. And don't take someone else's word on it being a good movie.

Nevertheless, the directing is amazing and the photography is positively breath-taking. In fact, I'm positive you can watch this movie in Chinese with no subtitles and still be impressed.But I really need to defend this story. The relationship between Broken Sword and Flying Snow is heartbreaking, and not just at the end. The writing is such that, even with different versions of the story, the emotions between the two are similar so you don't get to meet different people every time a version of their story is told.But the concept of ""All Under Heaven""... now that's a winner.If you haven't seen this movie, you should... soon...

My views of the film changed while the story progressed. I was particularly disappointed with the first 20 minutes of the movie with the matrix-type of slow motion kung fu actions. * Caught my husband dozing off * I thought Zhang Yi Mo could do better than this, probably because I was hoping to see more traditional Chinese fighting scenes. As the story moved on with changes in the 'colour scheme' used in the movie, I began to change my opinion of the movie. I definitely loved the way Zhang chose to tell the story. It was 'refreshing' from my point of view. Maggie Cheung was excellent in this movie! In comparison with CTHD, I still prefer CTHD, mainly because of a stronger story line and good acting casts.

Why are so many fooled by the trivial relevance of Social Network's ""I use Facebook, they made Facebook"" moronic thinking whereas I almost let a film like this slip through my watch-list? Hero is what films are supposed to be; a balancing act between visual, audio, acting, writing, and editing. A poem of the arts of films. You cannot pick one of these parts and say ""that's what made this film"". You will not hear talk of the acting vs. the script vs. the music.This is a seamless balance of the filmmakers' tool kit. Perhaps it is its perfection of balance that fails to ""dazzle"" the easily amused, as the film hypnotizes in its elegance.I wish I could say I wish Hollywood made films like this, but I know they never will. So I am simply happy SOMEBODY does and hope reviews like this point people in the right direction and away from box-office opera fad.",Hero

However, unfortunately the trailer was the best part of it. The special effects were horrible and obvious. I've seen better fight scenes in Jackie Chan's movies. The story was epic and twisting and may be difficult to follow for some. The subtitles do not match the English voice overs and therefore were distracting. So either use the subtitles and do not turn on the English voice-over, or turn off the subtitles if you want the English.

The storyline is very well written and very interesting. I love the way that they portray the characters in the different roles. The action sequences are very cool, and the movie has great special and visual effects. The sensuality is very mild and last for a total of about two minutes tops. Jet Li portrays a nameless character who has something very secret planned along with some other people. But I will not let you know for if I did you wouldn't enjoy the movie! The mystical Chinese jumps and flying things are in this but it very much works with the plot and storyline. The screenplay is also very well written and with the DVD you can choose to have it's spoken language in English instead of Chinese. This movie in about every aspect is a great and awesome movie. I think that people of all ages will be able to see this movie and enjoy it very much, though younger people may prefer the spoken language to be English.

495,kevinkennedy_1,Beautiful cinematography can't (or shouldn't) help this poorly done film,4,1 May 2005,"This may be a beautifully shot film,it may also be the most beautifully shot film in motion picture history, but i'd like to think that the minds of cinema goers are a bit more open than to have a few nice shots win them over. My major problem with this film is the fact that due to the storyline, all the fights seem to involve someone letting someone else win for one reason or another, so those people wanting to go and see two guys with swords trying to kill each other will feel a little cheated here.Another problem i had was that the director/writer seemed to be trying to throw to many ideas at the screen at once, and although this did result in some good scenes (fight in desert), it did throw up some stupid CGI filled scenes (fight in forest). Which leads me to another point, it could be imagined that the country that seems to be the inventor of martial arts would like to create films that makes martial arts look real and impressive and human. But this film insists on using special effects to show a raindrop bouncing of a sword or to show a whirlwind of leaves which didn't tickle my fancy.Finally, because the script is done badly, it creates characters that are hard to relate to or understand, so when one off them gets killed off, its hard to care.

496,MichailB,A beautiful painting first and foremost,9,10 May 2005,"I watched Hero about five times but I never took it as a mere movie. Its story contents, historically and politically, may very well be questionable; I can agree on that without hesitating. The one thing however that seems to be without discussion is its tremendous visual beauty and amazing music score. I sometimes put in the Hero DVD just to listen to the music only.To get a broader view of the historical topic, the Chinese unification of the seven kingdoms under the emperor of Qin, the movie ""The Emperor and The Assassin"" by Kaige Chen may be taken into consideration as well. Yet when it comes to Chinese movie arts, Hero surpasses every Chinese movie I have seen up to now (not very many I have to admit).In contrast to other opinions I will not comment on the martial arts aspects, nor on symbolisms found all over the place. To me this movie simply represents a beautiful painting containing people moving and fighting, loving and deceiving. The painting is accompanied by one of the most wonderful Chinese music scores I have listened to so far.Hero clearly needs to be enjoyed, not discussed.",Hero

With one exception the characters are mean, one dimensional, selfish failures. Moon alone stands out with integrity and consistency. Perhaps this was the only opportunity the director dared take to get across a humanistic message. But in the end Moon is also abused by the party machine as she urges Nameless to rethink his plans to assassinate the murderous King/Communist Party. Without her character this movie is pure Communist Party propaganda = suffering, cruelty, sacrifice and oppression are acceptable for the 'greater good'. So Tibet and all Chinese democrats can expect to be obliterated for the sake of National Unity. Taiwan should also be worried. Academics can expect to be visited by a mighty army and destroyed just like the calligraphy school. I fact, the military extras were all drawn from the Red Army! It's an epic and operates on a grand scale - enjoy it for the visual spectacle and sounds and very long hair. Try, if you can, to avoid thinking about the message and its sinister undertones.",Hero

500,nitesr2long,A beautiful and intriguing film......,8,7 August 2005,"This is a wonderful film.First and foremost it is a work of visual art. Every scene is made to be as appealing to the eye as possible. There are shots from the film that one could frame and hang in a gallery. It is a pleasure to just watch.Secondly, the movie is about political intrigue. ""Who is nameless?"" ""What are his motives?"" ""Did he really kill the most dangerous assassins in the land?"" These are the questions the movie asks. The story is quite good. It has no clear good or bad guy, and flips around the perspective several times. The story is one of the best in Chinese action films, and stands up against even more story-driven films.Overall there is little wrong with this movie. Most westerners would disagree with ""The individual doesn't matter"" way of thinking, and it certainly does smack slightly of communism. However, it is a foreign film, and they see things differently. The only other complaint I have is a minor one. Some of the scenes are a touch indulgent. They last longer than necessary and are just prolonging nothing. But that is a matter of taste not quality.",Hero
501,Rookie676,My First Wire-fu,7,8 December 2015,"This is the first time I've heard of or seen Wire-fu, I had only seen it parodied and butchered in side jokes in comics before this movie. Now that I've seen it... I'm not sure what to say that I expected.I have to say, at first watching the choreography with the wires was a bit awkward, even laughable, but I am rather fond of how the wires were used to an advantage. The fight scenes were beautiful to watch, part of the fun was never knowing what turn it would take next. Although... the fight scenes were extremely drawn out, much more than necessary. Although it was pretty to watch and elegant, it became sour after seeing all the wires had to offer and the 'wow' had worn off. Something I find extremely likable about ""Hero"", though, is the way the different perspectives and stories were shown and revealed. I know it's meant to be a bit of a mystery as to what was the actual story, but once Nameless acknowledges the story the Emperor brings forth, that kind of removes the mystery factor. The plot twists involved with the changing story lines forces the reader to continually make new connections and form new opinions on the characters throughout the movie, though, which is both a bit confusing and a bit interesting.The actors, though, were a bit stale. They never seemed to change facial expression, and their actions (beside the fights) were predictable. The only actors who seemed to show emotion were the students who tried to run from the calligraphy school while it was under fire. (a valiant choice to make, such loyal and courageous students to the written word)The color palettes, on the other hand, were gorgeous. Each bit of scenery, each new location had a different color, a different mood to match the scene in the movie. The orange of the leaves, the sand of the deserts, and darkness of the Emperor's throne room, each so very different and unique. (My favorite color scene one was the fight scene with the orange leaves)Would I say I like Wire-fu because of ""Hero""? No, probably not. I'll stick to animation and CGI, thanks.",Hero

503,hyrum_tanner,My favorite moment.,8,3 October 2005,"There are a lot of things about this movie that I liked and many things that I didn't like. The cinematography was nothing less than breath taking, though the plot left something to be desired.After all was said and done, I had one favorite moment (although it sort of happened twice): when Broken Sword closed his eyes during his fight with the king. You could tell he had read his opponent and knew exactly what to do to kill him. But he also knew exactly whether or not he should kill him, because he suddenly understood his opponent (like Seraph says in The Matrix). This master swordsman was so good that he was able to think clearest in the moments where for anyone else training would have taken over and driven home the killing blow. And the director/editor/actor delivered that message so clearly and beautifully.The other time this happened was what I believe was in some ways the most significant moment in the movie. I didn't even get it until watching the movie a second time. When Broken Sword let his sword fall instead of defending himself from Flying Snow's attack. I say this is sort of the same thing because he again consciously overrode his training and made a better decision. The reason I say this might be the most significant moment in the movie is that it punctuates what Nameless just said to the king about the greatest choice a swordsman can make is to lay down his sword. Broken Sword is the real Hero of this film.",Hero

Martial arts movie were better when the fighting was somewhat believable and showed some interesting characters, historical pieces were better when related to History.

505,inanna5,Crouching Tiger meets The Usual Suspects,8,17 January 2003,"Superb cinematography, striking base-color costumes, fluid fight/ weapon choreography, exquisite sceneries ..... all at the expense of the plot - which is so thin (in order to deliver the many versions of the same events) that not even the stellar casts could pull it off. To those of us that have some background in Chinese history of the period -the entire story becomes utterly implausible, and the lack of character development rendered the main protagonists two-dimensional (only one actor shines through - the venerable mainland actor Chen whose portrayal of Emperor Tsin is somewhat fleshed out). In my opinion, Zhang YM should return to what he does best - vignettes of peasant lives or family dramas.Despite incorporating the many breathtaking Chinese landscapes and organizing thousands of army extras into some of the grandest scenes since Ben-Hur, Zhang definitely lacks Tsui Hak's vision of what constitutes a great period Kung-Fu movie (nor did Ang Lee succeed in this genre - CTHD was a novelty to the uninitiated Western audience but largely panned by jaded Asian audiences).Granted ""Hero"" was a beautifully-crafted vehicle to showcase Zhang's talents, but what a waste of resources! The film would have been a masterpiece in the hands of someone like Tsui, but now it's only a shadow of the equally inadequate CTHD.See it for some of the most stunning picture compositions in recent years, ignore the storyline and don't expect anything new in the martial arts scenes.",Hero

However it moves very slowly and, as noted above, has only the worst of Hong Kong cinema's martial arts choreography.

507,seoulbaby,great on so many different levels,10,18 April 2006,"Flat out one of the best movies that I have ever seen. You may need to see it at least twice in order to fully understand the plot. Americans should also keep in mind that this is a Chinese movie, not an American movie about China. Therefore, the acting and dialogue might appear stilted and overly formal to American viewers. Chinese historical dramas are made in this style, it's a cultural thing. The reason why this is a truly great movie is because it is great on many different levels. The cinematography alone is stupendous. There are story lines involving suspense and romance. The movie is driven not just by action, but by character development. In addition, there are kick-ass martial arts scenes. However, this movie goes beyond the typical martial arts movie because martial arts is presented as a philosophy, not a just as a really cool method of fighting. Many people do not understand that Asian martial arts is a culture, religion and way of thinking unto itself. The ultimate goal of a martial arts master is self-control,inner peace and non-violence. This is achieved by becoming so proficient and so well-known that no one ever wants to fight with you. This concept is crucial to the viewer's understanding of why the romance ultimately fails between the two lovers. The other aspect of this movie elevates it above so many others is the theme of national unity versus individual agendas, of collective nonviolence and peace and the giving up of the individual right to revenge, no matter how honorable. This movie came out during GW Bush's administration(s), when the United States was divided over the Middle East, 9/11 and Iraq. Not only is this movie well-made on many different levels, it achieves a cultural and timeless relevance. At the end of the movie, the assassin (Nameless) finally ""gets it"" and realizes that his motives to kill the Emperor pale in significance to the Emperor's attempts to achieve peace by unifying China. That is why he gives up his assassination attempt and why he becomes (one of) the hero(es), the other being the Emperor himself. In America, there are those who believe that the best way to end violence is through revenge. Others believe that giving up one's right to revenge (not self-defense) and working for peace through a higher authority (e.g. the collective authority of many nations) is the more successful way. No matter what side you're on, this movie addresses these timeless issues.Amendment: I should acknowledge that I wrote all of the above before reading some of the other reviews on this site. As an American, I did not realize that the character of the Emperor was based on an actual historical figure, nor did I know anything of the brutality of his reign. At the same time, as an American, not for one instant did I think about any parallels to the Communist party in China, nationalist propaganda or dictators such as Hitler or Stalin. Call me ignorant, but I took the movie at face value, which I saw as a fictional story about the philosophy of martial arts, non-violence and peace.",Hero

510,MehemMehem,Great movie,9,1 November 2006,"The plot may be next average but this is no big deal for this movie as far as I see it.. There are at least four reasons for that:1. Hero is a gorgeous film. The imagery, colors and cinematography are stunning in every scene.2. The battle scenes are very good. No one believes that Chinese mythology's flying or walking on water but these scenes are so well crafted that I enjoyed them very much. And also there are some awesome conventional fight scenes - as when one of the assassins humiliates seven elite royal guards without unsheathing his spear.3. The kings army strategy is the most believable I have ever seen in a movie. In all other movies archers shoot a number of volleys and then hand to hand combat begins. Stupid. In contrast the king's archers in ""Hero"" will shoot dense flocks of arrows literally for days whoever they confront (even helpless civilians, academies, etc.) and after that infantry moves to clean whats (if any) left.4. Ziyi Zhang is so hot. For me the hottest actress. I never bothered to read the subtitles while she was on screen so I have little idea of her character (Moon).",Hero

When the assassins came after Jet, I could sympathize and was shocked they didn't put him to death! His life was lived in complete self-indulgence and he didn't seem to care one bit for ""his people"". So, for the only time in history, I found myself rooting for the assassins! If you DID actually enjoy this film, I can suggest several other epics that are dreadfully dull and overrated: The English Patient, Gandhi, and Ryan's Daughter.This is NOT to say that I dislike epics or long movies--just not ones where you could care less for the characters (with the exception of Gandhi) and where the pacing is so slow.

514,erasure_1998,Assumptions...,10,25 February 2003,"The difficult aspect in critiquing Hero is that no doubt numerous people will make comparisons to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Of course, one realizes that no matter what Hero does, it will be seen as either a rip-off of, or deviates too much from the whole hearted international appeal of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Did Zhang Yimou intend for Hero to garner international appeal? I do not know. But point in case, no matter what, any film can be seen in a negative light depending on one's criteria. And just as a critique is an individual's opinion/evaluation of a body of work based on a set valued criteria, often times the expectations we bring to films can deter us from understanding the filmmaker's vision. Zhang Yimou is a filmmaker originally from China. Ang Lee is a filmmaker originally from Taiwan. Peter Pau's cinematography is distinctly different than Chris Doyle's. They are distinctly different filmmakers and cinematographers.Viewers often overlook the cultural background of the stories which such films are based upon. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Hero are based on mythical Chinese characters mixed within historical events. So while Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon's premise dealt with the ideal of being true to one's heart, Hero deals with the motto of how peace means letting go of all surroundings and being at peace with oneself. What did the emperor say towards the end of the film...""a true swordsman is at one with his sword and all that surrounds him."" Some might say the dialogue in Hero is cliche'd and repetitive. I would argue that the simplistic dialogue in the film often represents the characters at a loss of words; lack of communication often expresses more than flagrantly used words. Cinema is a visual medium, and the most dramatic context in expressing narrative story and emotion is through action, not words. Therefore, the simplistic dialogue in Hero reveals the inability for the characters to describe their emotions: more than likely a true representation of how men/women in the Qin Dynasty were unable to openly express their feelings.  What is the repeated saying in the film? ""All Under Heaven"" And in three simple words a deeper premise is outlined.",Hero

As the movie progressed and the first fight scenes came up, my thoughts were ""Well, but it's still very much like 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' ."" But then, as the movie progressed, I could see it was not. It was much better.""Hero"" has all the choreography and acrobatics of CTHD, but with a much more stunningly beautiful visual design. It is shot, after shot, after shot, that smashes you through sheer beauty of just the projected image, very often with only a minimalistic combination of shapes and colors. You can think of Gus van Sant's ""Gerry,"" only different.And when you start to get the overall picture of the story, you are faced with one that has ramifications and bifurcations and exploration of different viewpoints, very much like (and I would almost say at almost the same level of quality) many of the short stories that came out of the pen of Jorge Luis Borges. (My apologies for a possibly crass comparison between a product pertaining to Chinese culture and one pertaining to Western culture---this is a mapping that, in my lack of knowledge of Chinese culture, helped me establish cross-references.)

The most of them try to compare ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" to ""Hero"".What a terrible mistake ! As Hero cannot be compared to a classic 70's wu xia pian.For a simple but too often forgotten reason : These are only rare scenes in the storyline that are showing a neutral point of view.Most of the scenes are the visual render of what characters are telling, or imagining.And this is in my opinion the way Mr Zhang has found to admit his lack of technical talent (at this time) in filming wu xia. A modest and original way.Hero tells stories, with a rare poetry, a real attachment to the detail, that make each part of the intrigue visually unique. This is a kind of experience we all made, reading a book or hearing a story for the first time. Each person imagine the images so far from reality in the facts, depending of his visual, historical, cultural, moral bases.This is what Mr Zhang show us in this masterpiece, not a eloquent and false part of history in a unique vision, but the expression of what we could imagine, and what he and all the team made real for our eyes to see on screen.Hope you'll see his movie with that on mind.

My friend showed it to me from his DVD imported from Hong Kong, and I went out to buy it for myself the following day.I was pretty excited to hear it was coming overseas, a little nervous they would chop it up, but excited nonetheless. Now that I've seen the trailer for the U.S. release, my fears seem validated.1. The trailer gave away pretty big spoilers almost immediately. 2. The way it described the three assassins was entirely inaccurate, indicating that they worked for the emperor.This is a great film that everyone should see, but those that see it based solely on the weight of the trailer will be expecting a much different movie than Hero.",Hero

523,Kilcoe,I have to say it's not as good as many users had commended.,2,27 May 2004,"I have to say it's not as good as many users had commended. Most Chinese do not regard it as a masterpiece at all. The plot is so surreal and illogical, the theme is way too political!I was very disappointed (even now， two years had passed). It's simply not worth to see, the film is pointless. Actually, for many of us, it's quite insulting. Initially, I couldn't believe it is directed by Yimou Zhang - one of the best directors in China, who directed To Live, He understands Chinese so well, yet he directed this - a film without HEART. The acting is awful as well, practically not much acting. The actors and actresses are the best ones from China and Hong Kong. Their performances in other films, except Jet Li's, are so much better and more convincing.People (without much knowledge and background of China and its history and culture) may be misled by this film, they might think it reflects culture, history, martial art¡­, but not really. It is an ill illustration of our culture and values. Also, some people might think it is an independent film. It was the most expensive film ever made in China. Not saying this is not good. Just saying it's an extremely commercial film; presenting art is not the main purpose. And, to get a wide release in China, the theme is strictly censored and 'modified'. For Chinese, it's a lame and overly pretentious film just like the way Americans view Pearl Harbor.One of my friends told me: ""I think it is an advertisement rather than a film, because the plot doesn't make any sense to me! "". Not just an ad for martial art or scenery, it is an ad made by the government! The way it approves dictatorship disgusts me. We simply do not agree its concepts; ordinary Chinese don't want to be governed by an idiot who kills millions of people. And, it's not a film; it's just a collection of 'beautiful' photos. Yimou Zhang is a big fan of Akria Kurosawa. From his first film till now, he reproduces the ideas, the techniques and even dogmas of Akria Kurosawa. The suspense and the 'fantastic' scenes appeared in Ying Xiong is just a combination of Kurosawa's Rashomon (In the Words) and Kagemusha (The Shadow Warrior). I just can't believe.

524,abban,Force of Poetic Expressionism,10,26 June 2003,"By all means, this is a remarkably well told and beautiful movie.When I saw this movie I finally understood the meaning and function of the extreme flying and jumping in some of these Eastern martial arts movies. I've never really figured the point of it before - and it has been quite distancing to me, hindering identification and full appreciation of other similar movies.In Kung-Fu and Tai Chi there is something called Chi, dealing blows where you invest ""psychological power"" into you blows. This is what this spectacular jumping and flying comes to stand for: The protagonist investing some sort of psychological desire into beating the opponent, by jumping, flying, kicking and hitting their adversaries.Hero is also a vastly superior movie to most Chop Socky films. It ranks alongside Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Barefoot Kid as one of the best Martial Arts movies made. This really is because it is much more than merely a kick and jump movie. The Rashomon-like narrative of an historical drama, makes this movie transcend most of the genre. Best foreign movie I've seen in some time. Better than Crouching Tiger...",Hero

In Hong Kong, or China, many people will say this is not an outstanding movie. Yes, the shot is beautiful. The fighting is great. But the moving is quite boring. Most importantly, the plot is weak and does not truly refect the Chinese culture. The story of ""Hero"" is like this: there were seven kingdoms in China and Qin was the most powerful one. A few assassins (""Nameless"" (Jet Li) being one of them) wanted to kill the King of Qin. But ""Nameless"" ""discovered"" that the King of Qin can unite the China for the good of the whole Chinese citizens so he gave up killing the King.In ""Hero"", it described the King of Qin as a good King who wanted to unite China for peace finally. But in the history, we Chinese all know that the King of Qin was a cruel king who by all means of foul to achieve what he wanted. There was really (or a famous legend or story) a assassin from one of the seven kingdom had tried to kill him but failed. The King of Qin ruled the citizens under high pressure. I have no idea whether the movie has any political reasons, but it really distorted the Chinese history.Another thing which is quite absurd is the use of colors.

Maybe this happened, Maybe that happened, maybe it happened a different way - I don't care. There's a real story in there and two guys arguing about the details. It seems more that the movie is contradicting itself than different versions of the same story. Why doesn't anything actually *happen*?

537,iamconfounded,What does it mean to be a Hero?,10,13 February 2003,"There are many ways to ask this question, and many more ways to answer it. Although point of view would affect the answer in most circumstances, Hero does not present a circumstance in which the title of ""hero"" can be sullied by allegations of propaganda.The problem is ideology: one's own, not the movie's. Without an open minded concept of the world, that is, an equally high minded ideology, one could misread the Zhang Yi Mou's intentions in Hero.Hero does not glorify war, nor necessarily a country. The film focuses on individuals and how an individual can be a hero. If one is a hero for courage or strength, we have courage and strength in the film. If for undying love, we have love. If for benevolence or leadership, selflessness or sacrifice, loyalty, service, or whatever quality that one holds dear in standard morality, Hero manifests it with stunning poignancy.I understand ""hero"" as greatness of mind and heart. A hero by this definition can encompass the needs of the world in his mind, and hold the pains humanity in his heart. The setting of Hero was a time warring countries and peoples -- as tumultuous and destructive as any in history. The movie dramatically depicts one with a rare greatness of mind and heart who can set aside his own burden, grievances, love or years or his life for the worldIf you liked Zhang Yi Mou's previous movies, or the martial acrobatics in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, you won't be disappointed here. I thoroughly enjoyed Hero even though it innovatively deviated from the Chinese martial arts series I'm used to. While I don't usually like artistic pieces, I enjoyed Hero nonetheless. This is a beautiful movie not only for the sheer artistry of its scenes, but also for grandeur of its scope. I'm not saying the Communist government will or won't benefit from this movie. Then again, just because every world government would benefit from it's heroes, hardly makes every hero story propaganda.",Hero

Yet once again this gets rave reviews here in the West when countless similar tales from the last 50 years get put on television at 1am and get given 1 star in the TV guides.And why is that? Because it had a massive budget thrown at it and much more time and effort spent on the cinematography. In short it looks polished and pretty and, visually speaking, is more of the standard we expect from Western films as opposed to the usual cheap-looking Hong Kong cinema.In essence that's the bottom line here. A typical low-budget Hong Kong film will sink with out a trace or receive poor reviews because it ""looks"" amateur to the Western reviewer. One that looks nice and has obviously had so much time spent on the cinematography, no matter how basic and clichéd the actual narrative content, will get great reviews simply because the director is showing off his skill. That speaks volumes about the snobby attitudes to cinema in the West really.This film looks very pretty and is full of great imagery. But you'll find better martial arts action in any bog-standard kung fu flick with a 50th of the budget, and you'll get a deeper and more involved storyline in most soap operas. If you value style over content, you'll love it.(I should point out that this review is based on the first 60% or so of the film.

After the whole bunch of film masses products this film exposes like a fine jade figure from real master. A composing of pictures,colours, lyricks and mystic elements. The character studies are not based on deep psychological analysis, the are more representionals for the state of mind in this chinese era - pride,anger,vengeance,fear,brave,...(comparable to the Knights in Europe)and are surpassed by a higher ideal - a new time has began for the biggest Nation of the world. So its Not so deep in philosophical questions like f.ex. Nitzsches works (oh dear! :-)) but much more heart-captive. This unusual high-quality work is very unorthodox is oundstanding from the masses of Hong Kong-Productions. The film is entertaining and spiritual as well, and is especially interesting for people who are interested in China`s spiritual elements in its history. Despite the fighting scenes are awesome, this film is not made for hardcore-martial art fans, but for people who always liked to hear tales from far countries and kingdoms with surreal elements.

In one such fictitious fight, in a faultlessly designed set, Nameless and Sky (Donnie Yen) close their eyes and fight out the battle within their minds. Screen time is being spent lavishly on showing how two characters contemplated a fight, whilst fighting each other in a battle that never occurred. It is confusing certainly, but perhaps Zhang wished for his audience to get lost in the plot's design so that they would not question the warrantability of half of the battle sequences, which make up most of the film.Yet, it is difficult to ponder these details when they are made so utterly insignificant when viewing such a spectacle. The sheer beauty of the battles, the gentle floating of the assassins as they fly around their arenas (which range from a forest full of orange leafed trees, crisp leaves falling down to the ground like rain, to the crystal clear and calm of a mountain lake), the costumes of characters at varying stages in the story line (red for passion, green for youth, white for truth, blue for love), the amazing army scenes which feature thousands of arrows being fired into the sky to create a black cloud that descends right on top of the camera, all these elements combine to produce a faultlessly perfect image on the screen, each frame a worthy photograph that gently reminds you why cinema is the greatest art form of the twentieth century.And characterisation is not lost in this beauty as one may have feared. Despite the irritating two dimensional performance of Zhang Ziyi as Moon, the other actors carry off fine performances, especially Tony Leung Chiu Wai as Broken Sword and Daoming Chen as the King. Their performances are especially credible as they are often drowning in the memories of the King and Nameless - they need to change slight mannerisms in order to reflect whose mind they are now in.",Hero
547,flemming-kristensen,Visual masterpiece and quite....dull,5,30 August 2004,"Sorry can't help it. The movie IS visual stunning, it's nearly perfect in it's genre, but to me if feels as charismatic as the communist regime in China.It's a monumental CGI stunt, nothing to do with martial arts at all. Tony Leung is the best actor of the lot, but he as the rest, hasn't got anything interesting to say. It's a movie filled with symbolic, open for interpretation. I don't get a kick out of it. To me a movie like ""Oldboy"" is 10 times as powerful as this movie.See this movie for the spectacular scenery, colors and CGI and show of for friend, by pumping up the volume in some of the fight scenes...great surround sound. That's it!6/10",Hero

All the fighting scenes are surrounded by great scenarios and colorful elements and choreographed until the last detail. The directing work is impeccable; we can see the director's hand in every little detail. I also loved the music particularly the music during the fighting scene between Nameless and Sky. I enjoyed to see how the actors are, like the have to be, at the service of the movie, and not vice versa like in most of the USA movies. Honor and courage, rare elements in this time are the most significant characteristics in Hero, a movie you HAVE to see. Try to see it in a movie theater or a big screen.",Hero

I don't see what is so ""beautiful"" about this - Sure, the scenery is great, but I can't get past the fact that the ""Martial Arts"" is so completely bogus. If you want martial arts, rent a Jackie Chan flick (or at least, I should say, one of the good Jackie Chan flicks.) If you want to see a movie even worse than CTHD as far as ""hey, we're Chinese, we don't HAVE gravity or physics of any kind here!"" goes, rent Hero. I'm not sure about the message they're trying to get across with this film - it was pretty difficult to tolerate. There was no realistic fighting at all in this movie. I hate to break it to you, folks, but people can't fly. They can't walk on water, either. Or was that supposed to be ""Dueling Jesus?"" :-P Plot: mediocre at best. Scenery: great Believability: dismal Please, people, even in sci-fi most people have to touch the ground every so often!",Hero
550,Sangue_del_Lupo,Excellent presentation of story and color,9,28 August 2004,"This is an example of why I love film. The director of ""Raise the Red Lantern"" again shows his affection for color and excellent sense of cinematography in this gorgeously shot epic. Detailing one man, called Nameless, quest to for vengeance, the movie is set in the contentious warring states period of Chinese History just before the emperor of Qin began his conquest and unification of China. Every scene is a sight to behold, evoking both the landscape and the costumes grand design. Beautifully framed shots abound and the art designs use of color literally causes set pieces and characters to pop off the screen. Brilliant reds and greens are contrasted to dark blacks and browns to create an almost 3D like-effect. Minimalist dialogue is easily combated by the actors' spectacular emoting, an unfortunate rarity in today's superficial movies. The director wisely focuses on the faces of his actors allowing their pain and joy spring forth in their faces not their lines. The sound track and effects only enhance the visuals giving even more heft to the scenes.A few words of warning: 1. This is a classical Wuxia style movie - derided by some as a ropes and wires movie like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Some may feel the effects forced but frankly they appear more real than the video game-like effects in the last 2 Matrix movies. 2. Its a Chinese film and is shown with English subtitles. This really should not be problem as the dialog for almost every scene is easily readable by even an average reader. 3. Its artistic license but the Emperor of Qin, who would become the First Emperor of China, is played far more sympathetically than history has accurately recalled. By all accounts he was a tyrant but his unification did end the constant bloodshed of the warring states period.In closing this is movie art at its best, a sumptuous feast for both the eyes and ears.",Hero
551,Spectrocon,An excellent display of visual art and storyline,6,24 July 2005,"This movie is one example of movies when at it's best. The director, who also directed Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has once again created a movie with spectacular visuals and a plot that gives Hollywood a bad name. Although the plot is complex at times, it's almost impossible to not to be impressed. This movie is a masterpiece all the way. The actors does a great job, Jet Li is not known for being a great actor but in this movie he stands out, and so does the whole cast. The storyline is in fact very romantic and it contains a big deal of emotion such as jealousy and hatred. So with all those features combined with each other and a soundtrack with one of the best orchestras in China, what do you get? Do not be afraid to see it just because it's in Chinese I promise you, you won't regret seeing it.",Hero
552,edward_ruggeri,Beautiful Cinematography,8,11 September 2004,"The cinematography of this movie is excellent, as is the storytelling. It is without a doubt one of the best Asian films I've seen yet. Examples include the color changes as different stories unfold, and a rain-soaked chess house. These are some of the most interesting cinematic moments I have seen. Many people may mention a fight scene involving flying leaves and an interesting forest/garden. However, I did not find that very well done. But it was certainly interesting.Unfortunately, I have never much enjoyed the flying around which was so prevalent in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It is less obnoxious in this film, but it's definitely there. Of course, the whole genre includes that motif, but I don't like it, and I find it cinematic ally boring.The sword play is exciting and fast paced. The music of a blind beggar on an ancient 7 stringed instrument (somewhere else has the name) is very exciting when set to one of the fights. The soundtrack is definitely engaging and exotic.I thought the constant relating of calligraphy, chess, and music to swordplay was kind of trite. Though I thought it was a visual masterpiece, I felt the analogy was not very interesting. However, it was interesting to see the melancholy absorption of Broken Sword in his calligraphy work. A strong, emotional performance offsets this rather lame analogy. It didn't overly bother me.I thought the movie was great, but it's message (while terribly Chinese), kind of rubbed me the wrong way. The film is about what a hero is (which I kinda liked, even if it wasn't a new theme), but it is also about the importance of the group, the nation, the collective. That's a very Chinese thing - as an American raised in our school of Liberal Democracy, I have different ideas about the value of the state. But, it is interesting to see how our civilizations differ.So, to summarize, while I thought the hero theme was a little trite, and while I just disagreed with the ""big picture"" about society (which I don't hold against the film - it is important to be confronted with that which you don't believe in), the emotion, the melancholy, the excellent cinematography, and the music make it a masterpiece. It is brilliantly executed.I gave it a 9/10. I love it, and would consider buying it on DVD (I own precious few).",Hero
553,fault,It's a beautiful movie.,10,13 August 2004,"What people who aren't Chinese and who don't know much about Chinese culture fail to understand, is that the warrior mythology portrayed in films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero has its roots in a particular genre of fiction that has been around much longer than television or film.Having grown up reading a bunch of these stories of epic fantasy, I remember being surprised when I went to watch CTHD in the theaters, and saw the audience break out in laughter at the flying stunts. I suppose the concept probably does seem ridiculous to foreigners.The whole deal with the flying is this:In the stories, the world of ""Giang Hu"" mentioned in CTHD is the unconventional part of society in which the characters that practice high transcendent martial arts exist. ""Giang Hu"" literally translates to something like ""lakes and rivers"", which kind of is a cultural allusion to the fact that most of these people wander a whole lot participating in great duels of swordsmanship and all kinds of tragic drama.One of the forms of transcendent martial arts is ""chin guon"", which translates to something like ""the art of lightness"". It's a skill that these warrior folk develop from a young age using various methods that make it so they can move as if they were light as a feather. I think the idea is that they're trained so that they progressively have less and less of a perception of their own weight, and thus they can run up walls and fly across rooftops in style. If you don't understand, well, too bad.I find Chinese warrior mythology pretty interesting, and the problem is that these novels do not translate well. I'm not sure if anyone has ever tried. A lot of what goes on in them has a lot of cultural relevance and wouldn't be readily understood by certain people who have Western sensibilities. Hong Kong and Taiwan have for a couple of decades produced a lot of television shows that portray these stories, but they're mostly pretty cheesy like American soap operas. Which is why I find a film like Hero refreshing. Everything about the film's cinematography tells the story as as a fable, a fairy tale, a good myth where the characteristics that make the hero aren't so easily defined. I might as well also say that I enjoyed it far more than I did CTHD, since everyone else is comparing this film to that one.",Hero
554,Ancientdozer,Totally sweet. . .,10,30 August 2004,"The movie is simply a work of art.

I won't say anything about that. . but keep in mind the word ""arrows."" You'll know what I'm talking about when you see the movie. I love that part, hah hah hah!Oh, and the twist in the movie is totally badass. Of course, the American trailers screw it up and give it away to the astute viewer. Listen, people, ignore the previews and trailers for the movie unless it's, like, a Chinese version. The ones you see in the American theaters just don't present it right (unless, for some reason, they changed the dialogue in the movie).And finally. .God, I have a theory about Jet Li. He rocks in Chinese films but as soon as they put him in an American one, the movie sucks. We should learn from that, you know? Like, stop doing American movies, Li, it's not cool.",Hero
555,thechojin1134,Very moving.,9,29 August 2004,"It's a very rare occasion that a foreign, let alone Chinese, film ever graces it's presence into the local cinema around my hometown. Much to my delight, they decided to show Hero. I went into the film expecting a lot of martial arts action but received a little more than that. Not only was I treated to really amazing wire action, but the plot and the photography were actually more intriguing than the action. Jet Li, Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung, and Daoming Chen all gave wonderful performances. At some points I could actually relate to what their characters were feeling, which is very rare for me since this is first and foremost a period piece. The only performance that was a huge let down was Ziyi Zhang's. Ever since I saw Rush Hour 2 and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon I've had somewhat of a crush on this Chinese enchantress. Much to my dismay, however, I found her character quit useless in the plot except for a few key scenes, which could be questionable for their usefullness as well. Her character seemed to be a very minor character and the producers just used her mass appeal to sell more movie tickets. The plot reminds me very much of Rashomon. Rashomon is a Kurosawa Akira flick that functions mainly on flashbacks and the flashbacks are all initially the same but different as told by different people. It's always nice to see film makers make a movie featuring this kind of plot structure. It's very rarely done in this case. Also another Kurosawa reference that I noticed, is the scene with the arrows falling through the roof of the calligraphy school and the master refuses to move because he feels that his livelyhood should not be challenged by this attack. He just sits there and does what he is meant to do, make calligraphy. As he does this all kinds of chaos and destruction is happening around him, students are dying left and right, and he just sits there. This particular scene very much reminds me of Kurosawa's Ran when the king's castle is being attacked and all he can do is just sit there. While the context and theme is very different, they both remind me of the same thing. Sometimes you have to accept (or in Hero's case, challenge) the chaos that is happening all around you and accept your fate. -9 out of 10-",Hero
556,LeaLea,Visually Stunning,9,6 January 2005,"This movie was one of the most visually stimulating experiences I have ever experienced. The use of color to express the emotions felt by each character in each scene was breathtaking. In one scene, I'll call it ""leaves"" you are touched as the foliage changes before your eyes. It left me speechless. It was more of an experience of visual poetry than anything else. Yimou Zhang proved yet again that he has amazing vision. If you do not like martial arts films, watch it for the visual aspects, if you do, You shall be pleasantly surprised at the superb quality and the gorgeous way that they regressed to the old school way of martial arts films.

561,joseph-posnanski,Utterly Disappointing,4,4 May 2005,"It seems every Chinese action movie I've seen since Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is favorably compared to the Ang Lee classic. The problem is, the writing in movies like Hero and House of Flying Daggers is standard pap, there's nothing deeper, no overtones of things like honor, freedom and loyalty, things that made Crouching Tiger soulful.Hero is certainly visually stunning. But, it is without a soul, the Chinese equivalent of a Bruckheimer movie. Basically, I thought the story condoned any form of tyranny or suppression, to the betterment of the country. With this, I figured the neocons must love it, but that's off topic. And if the director was pressured by the nationalists to make it this way, fine - Howard Hawks and Billy Wilder were forced to conform under national pressure back in the 30s, but they still snuck in subversiveness, little hints that drove the story further.

But, even with all of these twists, it was still easy to follow. But i must say, the writing of the script definitely made the film. Although the dialogue didn't play a major role throughout, it was very simple and philosophical. As great as the plot was, lets not forget that this was an action movie. And it did not disappoint, the mystical fighting i feel has not worked in the past (crouching tiger, hidden dragon sucked), but it definitely did in this movie. The scene where they fight over the water was incredible. Not to mention that each scene throughout this movie had a theme of colors that typically followed what the characters were wearing in that scene. This particularly worked well throughout this movie because the colors are so vibrant and alive that it made the fighting sequences throughout that more special. Overall the camera work and cinematography was without a doubt some of the best i've ever seen, and i definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to take a break from all of the Hollywood crap.",Hero

564,topquark2,Shed your Western pretension to sophistication to enjoy the movie.,10,30 October 2005,"I will not get into summarizing the plot here, as many reviewers have already done so splendidly. However, I would say that it is advisable to lay down your prejudices against China/the Orient if you want to have a chance at enjoying the movie.It appears that quite a few Westerners jump all over ""Hero"" for its supposed ""Communist"" message, namely, sacrifice for the greater good. This criticism is, in fact, quite asinine. Though the message comes through very strongly in the movie, it is hardly a Communism-specific ideal. In fact, I would say that all historical heroes, the Western ones even, became heroes not for acts petty self interest (called ""individualism"" in the US), but rather for acts based on ideals which transcend individual gratification. It is thus quite interesting to see many Westerners decry Hero's message as Communist. This curious phenomenon brings us to the point of Western pretension to sophistication.The crux of the matter, truth be told, is the knee-jerk hatred and contempt many Westerners have for China. Most Westerners know next to nothing about China. Yet vitriolic polemics are always guaranteed to spout like the Old Faithful. This is the antithesis of individualism at work. This is ""group think."" Nowadays, it is no longer sufficient to simply watch a movie as a piece of entertainment. One has to ""interpret"" the movie, back and forth and inside out. There MUST be a deeper layer of meaning. One MUST see past what's apparent to dig out a hidden twist. Unfortunately, given the general ignorance of Westerners about China, there is not much material to work with except mindless bashing. Communism! Propaganda! The same o' Western tripe.So what is a hero? It seems that for many Westerners (not all), it is someone who survives 500 rounds of bullets to rescue the damsel in distress and, of course, to eventually fornicate with her.""Hero,"" or ""Ying Xiong,"" is not a historical documentary. If you can't figure that out, you have much graver problems in life. ""Hero"" is a piece of entertainment. A visually stunning and emotionally powerful one at that. Have no fear, go ahead and watch it. It won't turn you into a Communist.*PS: The words Broken Sword writes do no mean ""our land."" It literally means ""all under heaven.""

565,loom91,"Toxic trash, sublimely packaged",6,18 August 2005,"This movie is probably the greatest example in History of how to destroy divinely poetic cinematography with a toxic story.The cinematography was sublime, supernatural, heavenly. The soft glowing lighting schemes, Crouching Tiger style martial arts and brilliant photography makes the movie a seven-star extravaganza for the eye. There's some good music. And that's where the good things end.The story is trash, but not some harmless trash, but radioactive toxic waste that will send the Geiger counter flying.(WARNING:SPOILER COMING) Taking the logic used to justify the Kings actions in the end(the King is taking over other territories to unify China), one can justify all sorts of despicable imperialism. Going by that logic, you can not blame Hitler for trying to take over the world, he was only trying to unite the world under the banner of Germany. The best course of action for the Allies would have been to step down and let him do his stuff, for the good of the world.The concluding propaganda about the Emperor was also a bag of black lies. The Emperor historically was no where near the heroic figure made out by the movie, he was a vile fascist man who attempted to erase all records of Chinese history before him by indiscriminately burning all libraries in China. The Hero is not a Hero, but a misguided man who rendered mankind a great disservice by refraining from killing the King. Making out the Emperor to be a noble man is as great a crime as holding Stalin to be mankind's savior.

Personally, I don't feel that the label ""martial arts"" even applies to either of these films, since they both go SO far beyond that convention and stand strong on so many other merits. The story of ""Hero"" is not that complex, but does offer a uniquely suspenseful trail. The unfolding twist in the story appear to have one main goal....""color"". I don't know that I've ever seen a more visually beautiful film, in my entire life. To me, there is a gigantic power to a film that is so grand and magical....while not superficially falling prey to a large budget or CGI.

570,vicisaran,visual poetry,10,8 March 2006,"As a martial artist I am very picky about a lot of things when I go to watch action films. As a movie enthusiast I'm not really looking for much more than good, thoughtful, solid, entertainment. ""Hero"" is the only movie I can say deserves MORE than a perfect 10. It's not that this movie is good, or is artistic, or stars 2 of my favorite martial artists (Donnie Yen and Jet Li), or is big budget (by HK standards). It's just that this movie BLEW ME AWAY.So people complain that the martial arts in it is unrealistic. So what? Martial arts is my life, but I don't expect every action movie I see to be realistic. If that were the case, then car chases in films where the cars flip over and crash and immediately explode would not exist. No action film would be innocent of staying completely realistic then. Plus, this story is about a myth, a legend. You expect everything to be real? People say most fights in real life end up on the ground anyway, and if Jet Li and Donnie Yen fought and ended up on the ground, it'd take away from the artistic aesthetic of the film.Both my parents are half Chinese, my dad speaks Mandarin and Cantonese fluently and my mom speaks Mandarin. They loved this film Even though the Emperor was portrayed in a way that undermined the Chinese view of him, it still doesn't take away from the film. As far as I know, Hero is not a documentary. It's a movie, and the actors portraying the characters do a great job to further the plot. Even if these characters really did exist, historical accuracy was not the point. If it was, why was everything from the sets to the swordplay to the music so poetic? Why was the focus on the characters and their relationships and on the aesthetics and not on this dynasty that existed? Hero is visual poetry, and poems have no use in life other than to please/entice/stimulate/provoke the emotional center of the human spirit. And Hero did just that.",Hero
571,movie-buffalo,Exquisite Chinese Martial Arts Ballet,9,16 March 2006,"""Hero"" is another one of those Chinese sword-fighting action films, exquisitely designed from the same kind of cloth that was used for the recent Academy Award-winner, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" Both films help to define a unique cinematic genre that might be called martial arts ballet.Like Crouching Tiger, Hero features lush imagery, constant acrobatic sword-play, intriguing special effects, and characters who leap impossibly through the air while they fight. Like Crouching Tiger, Hero uses the structure of having a character tell a narrative, with flashbacks interwoven at different segments of time to illustrate the narrative. Then, another character relates the same salient events from a different point of view, thus rebutting the first character's version while twisting it into a new and exciting dramatic situation. This type of story-telling technique not only provides a flexible and versatile (if somewhat artificial and forced) cinematic structure, but it also conveys the message that nothing is at it seems at first sight: there is always one more way to view a series of events. The truth will come out only if you can obtain the correct perspective on events. At that point, a person's true character will be revealed by the action he takes.Woven deep within the fabric of the acrobatic sword-play, Hero, like Crouching Tiger, has a poignant love story element, in which the lovers must somehow sacrifice for the greater good. In this case, the meta-message of Hero, which is set in a time of China's distant past, turns out to be that even unnamed heroes possessed with skills that go far beyond the reach of ordinary citizens, must sacrifice for the greater good of a unified China, poetically referred to as ""Our Land."" The clever way in which this political, ideological theme is interwoven into the love story and the martial arts scenes makes this a very powerful movie for nurturing a sense of nationalistic pride and patriotism among modern Chinese, for it mythologically links them back thousands of years ago to their ancestral past. In a country where ancestor worship is an established religion, this is powerful stuff.Unlike the rugged individualism and the Ayn Randish self-centeredness that functions as the primal undercurrent in the heroic cinema of the West, movies like Hero spring from a culture in which the primary social value requires that the individual subordinate his egocentric self for the greater good of his family, his community, his nation. While the West seeks to question tradition and to promote individualism within the context of developing an independent or rebellious spirit of mind, in the Orient, it is much more important to be interdependent with those around you, as well as to respect the authority and the values of those who preceded you.The entire narrative of Hero —and its underlying meta-message— is so seductively cloaked by a magically droning, ethereally haunting sound-track that you are slowly, but surely, hypnotized as you watch the different versions of the story unfold. The overall effect on a viewer's psyche is so subtle that no one would dare call this outright propaganda. But the legends which are being narrated, the new myths which are being created, and the cultural collective unconscious which is being nourished through martial arts ballets like Hero (and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) lead me to believe that these brilliant Chinese filmmakers have raised the art of cinema to an entirely new level of integrating mind, heart, and psyche. Western filmmakers, psychologically savvy statesmen, and open-minded, cross cultural entrepreneurs should take note.",Hero

I'll make a feeble attempt to say what an amateur might say about this movie. First, I do not understand why Quentin Tarantino's name is involved in any way with this movie. He was on the bonus material for a short while but added nothing to the movie itself. Secondly, the movie. The photography was like almost nothing I have seen before -- it was wonderful -- from the huge palace to the battle scenes involving thousands of actors. Also, from the falling leaves to the unforgettable sword fight on the most beautiful glasslike surfaced like I have ever scene. To me the story itself got confusing, but the photography, the settings and -- oh, yes -- the magnificent music (I have ordered the CD) made this a totally enjoyable experience for at least two of my senses if not more. I thoroughly enjoyed it.",Hero
573,Hahn,A stunningly beautiful thesis on the role of a hero,10,11 March 2003,"As many will say, this is not a mainstream movie.  It is an art film.  And if you watch it, hoping for some grand epic tale, you will be disappointed. However, if you look closer, you will find one of most well-done films in recent memory that attempts to define what the role of a hero is and the sacrifices it requires.  It is an essay on human nature and how circumstances may often compel us to do what we would have previously considered unthinkable.  The real strength of this movie lies in its structure - it is a story told within another story.  This framework provides the director amazing flexibility in utilizing visual cues to portray metaphors and symbols.Note:  Reading up a little about early imperial China and the Seven Kingdoms helps to provide context for the movie and brings greater weight to the events and allusions in it (such as the emperor declaring that he would standardize the written language).",Hero
574,frosty-19,trying to hard and failing,3,27 February 2006,"I usually don't write reviews, but on this one I felt the need to do so, because too many people seem to be misguided by this movie. First of all I find the message, that has been transported to the audience, all wrapped up in beautiful, different colored cloth, absolutely unswallowable. Open your eyes, this movie is so much propaganda it hurts. It clearly could be seen as a glorification and justification for fascistic regimes. I'm not the first to recognize, so if you stay focused and try to filter the ever so thin plot, you should actually get it. Understanding this and then seeing the reference in storytelling to great Kurosawa (Rashomon) made me very uncomfortable. Regarding the acting I have to say that it is below par. They all want this to be epic and fail on every level to achieve it. So you get these 'pregnant with meaning' looks, that go on for ever while the violin fiddles in the back. 3/4 of the flick is shot in slow mo to give it pathos, but after a while it just feels like they are trying to hard and they're just using the formula the wrong way. In the end these to the hilt extended scenes got me really annoyed, because with hardly no plot existent, it felt just ragged. Next I want to comment on the often praised style and sheer beauty of the picture. Yes, they did pick breathtaking locations and enhanced picture and sound and rounded it up with over the top martial arts (fighters flying over water - not my kind of pie), but, like I said, the excessive usage of slow motion and the bad acting often got me laughing, but seeing what message is transported through ""hero"" the laughs died on my lips.",Hero

A warning to viewers not used to Chinese cinema, this movie includes a lot of wire work and surreal feats of skill.  This all adds to the majesty and passion of this film.  Those put off by this might have issues with this movie, but you must understand that this is how Chinese fantasy is.

The philosophical concepts developed are also interesting. However, there is a disconnect between the fairly serious concepts of a real hero and the beautiful but fantasized fight scenes. Despite many people saying the flashbacks are like those in Rashomon that is not exactly correct. In Rashomon they deal with three different people's descriptions of an event, each favoring the individual speaking. The viewer is left to conclude what really happened for his or her self. This is what makes Rashomon a great movie. Hero's flashbacks go from a simplified deception to more or less what really happened, eventually resolving the ambiguities. In Hero the flashbacks and dialog develop a concept of what makes a real hero. It is an interesting concept of a hero; not exactly the usual one we see in typical American films.",Hero

And its real hero, a first for any action-adventure or martial-arts movie, is calligraphy.This is epigraphy, the graphic meaning of words that is added by writing. At its core is the Chinese word for sword, and in this pre-machine Qin dynasty, the sword is the meaning of fighting, of war. And the ending spells this out in a transcendent way.The formation of the guards, the battles, the classical Chinese special effects that enhance, the symmetry of the dance-fighting, and the frequent evocation of words, made me forget that the plot by typical standards is thin, and the dialogue almost non-existent. Just a few words and a few conversations of their meaning, tied together by Dun Tan's sweet score, and beautiful cinematography by Christopher Doyle.As a graphic designer, it is gratifying to have a movie where the hero is letterforms!",Hero

Also how they had a lot of martial arts action and the fighting scenes were very interesting to watch over and over again. One thing that I did not like was that Sky had to die right in the beginning and show up in the end and he was the only one who used a spear and his motion with it is just so swift and steady. He would have been a big help in the movie if he was still alive. One of my favorite parts in the movie was when Nameless and Snow were defending the school, it was amazing how they blocked the arrows and hoe Snow was using her robe to stop the arrows.

But if Crouching Tiger make it to the top at the Oscar as Best picture nomination then shame on the Academy if this film ( that is better than CT ) can't.This film is an equal to Crouching Tiger in it's fighting scene and beautiful setting. Maybe if you just see it in a glimpse it looks like a repetition of CT, the director just try to make money from CT success. Well it don'tThe epic story about the six kingdom and how they united as one great Empire of China is not a easy one to tell, and its cleverly told with only one long conversation of No Name ( Jet Li) and the Emperor. The story cleverly turns into many versions as the conversation goes on along the film. These many versions of the conversation visualized in the film required all actors/ actresses to change how they act on the same character! It is not easy but all the cast has done wonderful job especially Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung.A lot of Chinese philosophy  are brought along in this film and finalized with a great ending that will make people understand unlike CT that brings questions to western mind.Well enough said.

I guess most western audience may don't know Qin Shihuang(means the first emperor), the king in this film is the most notorious tyrant in ancient China. The Tianxia(Chinese word was spoken by the king, means 'the land and the people') spoken from his mouth is totally lie. From then on, one after another, all the king in ancient china spoke the same thing but very few of them did as what they said.Another fact is, Qin Shihuang's empire only lasted about twenty years before it was destroyed by people.Well, I do like the beautiful scenes of this movie, but it can not make me accept the idea that people should die for a tyrant.",Hero

586,mrwiseguy,Excellent,9,22 January 2003,"While i enjoyed this movie very much, i believe Hero will get the kinds of reviews and responses that Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (CTHD) did, and still does, ie. either you liked it very much, or you couldn't see what the fuss was all about.  This dichotomy of opinions makes for interesting study because it seems to cut across cultural and intellectual differences. Everywhere the film is shown, there will a segment of the audience that will love and rave about it, and another segment that will be wondering if they had been watching the same movie.  I can't explain why this is so, but i suspect it has a lot to do with a viewer's initial expectation of the movie, and then his perception and appreciation of the nuances in the telling of the storyline.Hero is a film that is beautiful in many aspects.  The direction and photography is artsy without being pretentious.  Every shot is worthy of being a work of art in itself.  The language spoken is traditional mandarin, but oh, so easy to the ear, even though i couldn't understand every word. (I don't think Tony's and Maggie's voices were dubbed, but i could be mistaken).  The main characters were very well acted out, especially that of the role of the Qin Emperor.  Zhang Ziyi's character was largely insignificant though, so i think she's been put in to add some star power to the production.  The fighting scenes are unusual by most standards, employing an interesting combination of CGI and real action.  Some of the powers that the characters possess appear too amazing to be true, but remember that some of the fights only took place in the fighters' imagination.  The music, though quite similar to that in CTHD, is appropriate, and sticks hauntingly to the back of your mind long after the movie is over.I went to the cinema having heard some of the hype leading to the movie, but with no real knowledge of the storyline, and not expecting a lot.  I think that helped me enjoy the movie more, because the way the story unfolded actually set me thinking and anticipating in a manner that i could not have had i known more about the storyline.  The message at the end of the movie is simple, but certainly open for debate.  In fairness, i don't think the director attempted to provide an answer, as to whether the decision made by the Nameless One was the correct one or not, but rather to ask questions. I'd better not give out too much here, but it certainly set me thinking about things for a little while after the show had ended.  These days, any movie that can get me pondering after the credits go down has got to be pretty good.Overall an excellent movie.  I'm sure some areas could be better, but i can't think of any right now.  Highly recommended.Score: 8.5/10",Hero

Worst of all, this movie delivered such a message: it is a good thing to contribute your life to a dictator, since this will keep the ""peace"".I cannot understand why it get such a high rating.

This was at the time, the most expensive HK production in history, and it's easy to see why. Armies of extras, lavish sets and costumes, wonderfully chosen locations, and obvious excessive care and time taken with lighting make this just beautiful to watch. The combat sequences themselves are just as artistic to watch. Once again, a warning to those who just can't get into the mythos of Master's skill, and can't accept the possibility of ""flying people"". Go and watch a Hollywood film where the hero survives 500 rounds of bullets instead. For those who appreciate the beauty of said combats, these are a joy to watch. A combination of slow motion and real time, make the sequences mini dramas with in their very own. Acting, which is sometimes found lacking in such martial arts fare is surprising good, especially Broken Sword and the King of Qin. Using Yimou Zhang, who's known for his drama rather than action, really makes a huge difference to the performances, especially the actors, who are more martial arts than dramatic arts. Overall, a visually stunning film, that doesn't lake in many other aspects of the film, but truly only for those who appreciate such films, as it will just be too long and unacceptable for others.",Hero

The best thing about this movie is the gorgeous swordsmanship scenes. Jet Li was able to devise a movie featuring various scenarios of sword-fighting without getting too repetitive. Some are subversive. While some are so beautifully poetic.This film is beautiful from the orange leaves to the green fabrics. This is a very beautiful film worthy to be seen by it's shots alone. To add to that, it's cinematography is mixed with it's sword scenes which creates visually arresting and unique scenes. Lastly, it's. use of color is just stunning. Google some of it, you'll get why.Okay:
The writing of this is full of exposition and it's rarely subtle. Some scenes are very self-explanatory but it's further explained by dialogues and monologues. It really doesn't add depth, it's just unnecessary. On the other hand, the film would greatly benefit if the characters were developed more. If it wasn't for the techincal aspects in some scenes, it would've totally failed. There's little emotional stakes, really.The themes in this one are just meh. It really doesn't provoke any intellectual arguments. If it does, it does so very little. I didn't leave the movie changed or anything. The theme's greatest strength is to help move the plot along and create pathos among the characters. Other than that, it's not really special.Bad:
The worst part is to sit through the acting of the king. He just delivers his lines, that's it. There's no gravity to what he says. There's no presence around him. It would make you wonder why he's king in the first place. You won't feel that he's malevolent. You won't feel uncomfortable around him. He's just there.

It is true that Qin Shin Huang is a ruthless tyrant who killed scholars, burned books and buried an army of 40,000 alive; it is equally true that his dynasty lasted mere 15 years. However, you rabid anti-CCP mouth pieces fail to realize that Qin Shi Huang lifted China out of 500 years of constant war, paving the way for successive dynasties by unifying not only China, but its writing and culture. Had it not been his brutal methods, China might well sink into another 500 years of tribal chaos after his death.That being said, I do not like this film. This whole movie revolves around the message of unity, but it does not lend this message any solid support. Its plot is mired by muddy narrative, and the motives of its characters unconvincing.

The story proceeds with the man relating the story of how he killed the 3 to the king.The cinematography is excellent with a great deal of blatant if somewhat obvious symbolism. The heavily stylized fight scenes are often interesting and creative.The film has a few problems. First, the characters are not developed very well. Fully one third of the film turns out to be false character development. There are at least 2 fight scenes which have nothing to do with advancing the plot, the characters or the story, and in fact are being told to the king by the Nameless man who was not even present to witness the fights. The dialogue is often boring and as unrealistic as the fight scenes.I found myself halfway through the movie saying please get to the point I've seen enough of people flying through the air and blocking arrows with silk dresses and unexplained physical abilities.The other thing I found uncomfortable about the film is it's simplistic message of the benefits of totalitarianism.

It's a sellout in box office, true enough, and also a sellout to our culture, only to please westerners who have no idea what real Chinese Martial Arts Literature is.In most of recent decades' Martial Arts Literature such as Jinyong's works, the Martial Arts Hero/Swordsman (pronounced Xia), just like Euorpe Knights and Japan Samurais, has a basic belief that is to help the poor civilians, overthrow tyrants and corrupted officials. Martial Art Heroes are often against the government, they don't belong to any kind of authorities or organizations, they stand on the same side with the people, just come and go in their own will, carrying out their own beliefs in justice. And in Hero, it works the other way around.Sure enough, Hero is a propaganda movie made by the Chinese Communist Government. Remember what the movie is all about? It teaches people that, for the course of greater good, one must sacrifices his own life to fulfill the country's need. Even though in the real history, the emperor killed all the scholars at that time, and burned out every book he can find, in order to keep his people from getting educated, so that the mind-numbed-never-go-to-school-people will not stand up against him, the movie teaches people to just tolerate the tyranny for the country's sake.That's so nonsense. So right winged. Hero is just a tool for political brainwashing.",Hero
606,sven_007,"Good, despite being disappointing on nearly every level (contains minor SPOILERS)",7,3 April 2003,"My DVD of 'Hero' (the latest epic soon-to-be-blockbuster to come out of China) arrived yesterday from Hong Kong. Who knows when it will even reach the cinema here. Anyway, I unexpectedly found myself with a free evening, so I settled down to watch it. It has 2 of my favourite Chinese actors in it, Jet Li and Donnie Yen, as well as Zhang Ziyi (who you will know from Crouching Tiger and Rush Hour 2), the critically-acclaimed Maggie Cheung, and Tony Leung, who I've only seen in comedies before. I'm afraid I will make comparisons to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (hereafter CTHD) - I know I shouldn't, as the films are very different, and intended to be very different, but to an international audience, this is probably the only other Chinese film they will know/have seen. And there are certain similarities... For example, the music in Hero is once again composed by Tan Dun. I say composed, but he practically takes the CTHD score and changes 2 notes, then says 'look what I came up with'. It's that similar, which slightly annoyed me, as I was never that impressed with CTHD's music anyway. It works for some scenes, but Tan Dun (for me) doesn't know how to add atmosphere to a fight with his music. Nor was I particularly impressed with Faye Wong's theme song, despite being a big fan of her's generally. The storyline of the film, once I understood what direction it was taking (3 variants on the same story told from different perspectives), was pretty good and worked well, avoiding become boring by repetition. However, the character development was really not up to much. The film only scratches the surface of the characters, particularly Broken Sword (Tony Leung) and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung). In acting terms, these two are Chinese superstars, and were sorely understretched. We learn far too little about their relationship in the past, their devotion to each other, and their current difficulties. All this is explained away in a few sentences. Thus, I never felt the intended emotion at the prospect of their separation through death, or convinced by the commitment they finally decide to make. Perhaps this is the limitation of telling a story 3 times in 90 minutes. Similarly, Zhang Ziyi was underused, and her role was overly similar to her character in CTHD: a young, impulsive and passionate girl. Jet Li, I thought, did well, as did the Chen Daoming as the Qin Emperor.And, like CTHD, this was beautifully filmed, although again a few scenes seemed to borrow from its famous forerunner; fighting in treetops or skimming across a beautiful lake, for example. Having said that, the scenery is also very different - this is northern China as opposed to the leafy green south of CTHD.  Overall, I still enjoyed the film, despite being a little disappointed with just about every aspect of it. I'm glad it didn't win Best Foreign Film at the Oscars; it's certaintly not that good. And, I don't think, as good as CTHD. Above average, but unspectacular. 7/10",Hero

The cinemagraphy is simply breath-taking.I know some people are having problems with this movie because people were flying (or jumping high and wide) or two people could defeat 3000 people. However, it's probably because they don't know old Chinese, Korean or Japanese history.  In Asian history (by formal historic record), there have been many martial art experts who could jump over high walls or defeat thousands of people by himself.

609,kate-805,"Practicality, not propaganda",10,23 May 2008,"This is not a piece of communist propaganda. It *looks* like propaganda in order to get past the censors, but the underlying message is subversive. Look at the cold sterility of the imperial scenes, the facelessness of the imperial armies and servants, the isolation of the emperor. Look at Nameless' very namelessness, showing us the destruction of the individual that the emperor's plans have brought about. Look at the way the imperial empire crushes the calligraphy school, a place of learning and spirituality, and the master calligrapher's statement that the emperor's archers may destroy their school, but they can never destroy their culture. Look at the way the rebel Broken Sword remains the most wise and noble character in the film, and how his nobility, and the final nobility of Nameless, is not to kill for peace, but to die for it. And at the end, Nameless doesn't spare the emperor because he's been brought round to his point of view, he spares him because he sees that, thanks to Broken Sword's calligraphy, the emperor has finally seen the value of peace; and Nameless' final words are to exhort him to remember the terrible cost of his great plan.Zhang Yimou has had a lot of trouble with the censors in his career. Before Hero he was known as a rebel, making dangerous, subversive movies, many of which are still banned in China. He hasn't suddenly turned his coat. He's learnt how to sneak his message past the censors.Wherever you stand on the politics, Hero is a truly masterful film. The direction, cinematography and choreography are some of the most creative and beautiful in the history of cinema. And the acting is similarly masterful. Where most directors would have cast established wuxia artists, Zhang Yimou cast two of his favourite actors, Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung, who are usually to be found in highly psychological Hong Kong dramas, and it was a great decision. The two of them have the ability to break your heart and convey the most complex emotions with the tiniest changes in expression, and they play off each other wonderfully. No wuxia star could have done this so powerfully. Especially impressive is the subtle distinctions they make in their characterisation between the different tellings of the story.",Hero

But on the whole it's not a very good movie.The biggie: the plot. It's annoying to see the same scene played out over and over again. (as one filmgoer asked, how many times is she going to die?). The overt message of peace (in a martial arts flick?) is blatantly contradicted by the explicit endorsement of the brutal slaughter of innocents in the name of 'Greater China'. The dialogue seems stilted, and the story is shortened to incoherence by being played out four times.Also weak: most of the action sequences. The wirework (flying scenes a la Crouching Tiger) is not up to Crouching Tiger/Matrix standards. It's hard to explain, but where in those movie people leaped gracefully, in this movie people sort of shoot here and there like jet planes. It's distracting and not very elegant.Other annoyances: Most of the acting is not very good and the movie demands acting since there is a lot of screen time devoted to lovers sacrificing themselves, tense dialogues, and political statements. Xhang Ziyi is badly misused as little more than a pretty porcelain doll that cries rather too often. The soundtrack is really rather bad, distracting from and sometimes clashing with the scenes, mostly too loud but sometimes hard to hear. There are also a lot of 'Gladiator' style graphics that are poorly executed, especially the flying arrows.On the whole it could be enjoyed over beer as a rental but it's no 'must see in the theater' classic. Not only is Crouching Tiger greatly superior but so are a whole generation of Hong Kong kung fu epics (including most of Jet Li's earlier movies).

615,maja06,Wonderful exploration of issues -- pity about the translation!,7,16 January 2003,"First things first -- while I enjoyed the movie tremendously with its alternative take on the concept of the Hero with its various possibilities played out through the different scenarios, I was also horribly annoyed by the gratuitous display of flying / floating figures in the film. It's time we moved on from Crouching Tiger!On the subject on the concept of the Hero, I wouldn't attach any political reading to the narrative of this movie though. What this movie really illustrates, perhaps, is that what heroism is really about is making a choice, being true to your beliefs, and taking your beliefs with you right to the very limit. This is perhaps what makes the rather unique genre of wuxia films rather universal in this regard.This being a 'Chinese' movie with a rather unique cultural setting, it is perhaps understandable that certain aspects of Zhang Yimou's filmmaking have been 'hidden' in cultural barriers...*caution: rather unfamiliar cultural references to be made next*One example of this is the motif of the wind. While this is more visible visually then as a metaphor, it did not help that 'all hail! all hail! all hail!' was chosen as the translation for 'feng' (i.e. the Chinese noun for wind). However, this reference may also be taken as an allusion to the Chinese 'feng chen', which may be loosely translated as 'happenings in the world around us'.Many other instances of culturally obsolete constructions abound. Unfortunately there may not be a better translation ever, or a 'Chinese Culture 101' guide handy when you watch a film. Kinda sad that an intelligent film is lost to a large audience this way.",Hero

If you're looking for another action/martial arts film--this isn't it. This is a traditional Chinese film whose focus is more on artistic cinematography. If you've seen director Yimou Zhang's earlier works like ""Raise The Red Lantern"" or ""Happy Times"", you'll appreciate this film.Pay particular attention to the use of colors that the director uses to re-tell the same sequence of events several times.

It was about 2250 years ago. At that time, China was composed of 7 major kingdoms that nominally subject to their leader: King of Zhou. King of Qin disposed of King of Zhou and then started his war to overwhelm other Kingdoms. It took him about 30 years to complete the plan.The assassin hero-ed in this movie is derived from a real assassin sent by prince of Yan. He had a name rather than nameless. Yan was the last Kingdom remained independent at that time, so prince of Yan plot the whole deal: he negotiated with King of Qin and would like to buy a peace treaty by offering 15 major cities to the King. He send-ed the assassin as missioner along with the rolled maps of the cities, among which a dagger was hidden. The assassin should kill the King with the dagger while he rolled open the maps and introduced the cities to the King. It was a very good plot but finally failed for one of the bodyguard of the King took the thrust rather than the King. The assassin was killed by the King right after that. And Yan, the last kingdom then was taken by Qin. And the king of Qin finally was crowned to be Emperor.Unfortunately, the King finally turned out to be a tyrant. He burned most of the books, buried scholars alive and built Great Wall by summoning 1.5 million men, using another 3 million men to build his tomb and palace.(Total population of China at that time was merely above 20 million) So his dynasty fell apart just 15 years after his death.For the King of Qin was supposed to be a bad guy according to our history, so the assassin sent to kill him turned to be a good guy. I should say that the director rephrase the history and would like to talk about something different from our traditional perspective, but in China, we did not think the making a success, for no one would like a movie to sing high praise for a tyrant.BTW: The Emperor also sent a general to the north frontier, beat-ed Huns tribes that harass his empire, those tribes were migrating to Europe in the next couple of hundred of years and finally nearly destroyed (West) Rome Empire under their intrepid leader: Atila - Whip of the God.",Hero

621,SwankyJosh,"Dull Jet, waste of Donnie, overall mediocre",6,19 April 2003,"Angst, angst, angst.  Fight fight.  Angst, angst, angst.  That's really what Hero comes down to.  Where is the charm?  The gentle humor and intimacy that complements the pathos and makes Wushu films so enchanting?  Well, let's start with the good - the cinematography is amazing, an excellent use of the entire widescreen aspect and a wonderful use of lighting and color; some clever directorial decision-making, as well, in the changing colors of Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung's costumes and the lenses used to tint the film. Also, these two actors also put forward very very strong performances; unfortunately, I've only seen each in one other film, and I was very impressed by their work here (especially with Maggie Cheung, though I've only seen her in the mediocre The Heroic Trio, so I came in with ""modest"" standards!).  Donnie Yen also does a fairly good job...but just isn't given enough screen time to really develop a character.  But the fighting choreography is superb.Now the bad.  First, Jet Li's performance is dull.  Very dull.  Usually the man can add life to the weakest script, but in his effort to project stoic hatred, he just projects, well, nothing.  Nothing at all.  And as I noted above, Donnie Yen doesn't get enough screen time to contribute much, other than a little moping...what a waste of talent!!  But the real problem is bigger than the actors; the movie lacks intimacy - we're TOLD the story, not SHOWN or DRAWN INTO it.  That's also the problem with CTHD, in my opinion. And hiding behind an ""artsy"" or intellectual facade just doesn't cut it. For a far, far better analysis of Kantian vs. utilitarian ethics (the question of killing the emperor; the question of whether or not to kill Jet at the end) check out Iron Monkey, in the brillant contrasts drawn between the ethics of Dr. Yang and Wong Kai Ying; similarly, to continue the CTHD comparison, for a much more fun - and more probing - examination of gender roles, watch Wing Chun, an earlier Michelle Yeoh work (with Donnie Yen too). These two hours of vast landscapes and non-stop tears, with no fun and joy and humor inserted here and there...well, it just wears you down and moves you from catharsis to boredom.So, in sum, Hero is not at all horrible...but with such an outstanding cast and respected director, it should have been much more.

Part of the beauty of this film is seeing it in it's original language, and not dubbed in English, often the re-dub takes away the emotion the film is trying to convey. The use of color in this film is simple, and spectacular at the same time. They mostly billed this film as a Jet Li vehicle, and while he has shown more range than he ever has before, the other actors deserve Kudos for their performances, all of them. What I would like to say about this film is the underlying social commentary about ancient China is very poignant, and still holds true today all around the world.

The film is set at the end of the warring states period in China (221 BC), and the essence of a Hero is portrayed throughout the film.  The key figure of the film, the First Emperor of China is the very same Emperor who completed the Great Wall of China.  You may have heard of the Terra Cotta soldiers discovered in China.  This film is about 3 assassins who plot to take out the man who eventually was buried with this terra cotta (full size life like replicas in clay) army of men and horses to ""protect"" him in the afterlife.This is the first martial arts movie of Zhang Yi Mo, however he has successfully directed many movies in China which have received many awards within China and abroad, including Red Sorghum, Raise the Red Lantern, and Zhu Dou.

This is an instant movie classic on par with Crouching Tiger. And like Crouching Tiger, this film stands firmly as an adventure/drama and does NOT attempt to weave in comedy or slapstick, as the last follow-up to Tiger did (Iron Monkey - also a great and classic film but very different). And also like Iron Monkey, Hero was previously released in Asia years before the American debut. I would highly recommend this film to any fan of martial arts films. Jet Li has a champion role, but Donnie Yen, Maggie Cheung & Zhang Ziyi are all in top fighting form. Plus, the acting from this all-star cast is excellent as expected. Unlike Iron Monkey and Crouching Tiger, Hero uses a non-linear approach to tell the story. This approach works very well for Hero, even though some of the flash-backs/perspectives may confuse some. However, in our post-Pulp Fiction era, this approach is to me always refreshing.

I wouldn't have a problem with that except for the fact that the changes are subtle, and on the third one I was just praying that the plot advanced with something different and not with another 'version' of the same little story.Aside from that, in line with what everyone says, the movie's cinematography is second to none; the handling of composition, color, and themes is breathtaking.

Unlike Kill Bill or Rush Hour, though wonderful movies in their own right, Ying Xiong stands apart in it's attention to one of the most essential elements to martial arts: art.  The action scenes are flawlessly smooth and textured both in the movements of the actors and their surroundings.  The various settings of each fight set the tone of the actors movements, as well as the movement and subjectivity of the camera.  When not fighting, the camera presents us with shot after shot that would each unto themselves qualify as a work of art.  When meshed together, they create a seamless continuity into which the fight scenes mesh perfectly.  This attention to the art of martial arts was touched upon in both Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (Bamboo forest) and Brotherhood of the Wolf (Opening rain fight), but neither of these films had the daring of Ying Xiong's pacing.  The camera work is so confidant in it's depth that it dares to slow fights down for artistic effect, not dramatic, and to slow the scenes between fights down rather then rush it's audience to the next fight.  This respect for the audience is evident in every shot of this visual masterpiece, and as both a martial artist and a Movie goer, I give this film a strong vote of ten out of ten.",Hero

This movie has some of the most powerful imagery of any I have ever seen. Though some may not like the high-flying wire martial arts (a la Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon), no one can deny the grace of the combat. Though the movie was released under Quentin Tarantino's name, and is often compared to his Kill Bill series, the resemblance is only passing. Where Kill Bill revels in violence and excessive gore, Hero focuses on the thought and philosophy of combat, and blood is seen infrequently. Instead of relying on pools of viscera to affect the audience, Hero uses clever and artistic camera angles. Though the swordplay makes up a large portion of the film, at the end of the day Hero is a tale of emotions, motives and philosophy, sacrificing oneself for the greater good. The films most noticeable blemish is the pacing, some scenes are just too long, but this is a minor complaint. Based in history, and steeped in the Chinese mythos, Hero's real battle takes place in the minds of its viewers, challenging perceptions about what a martial arts film can be.",Hero

The film relies on extended drawn out sequences of slowed choreography which were impressive in many of Jet Li's other works but lose all meaning when such vast quantities of CGI are added that the actors themselves seem detached reciting their lines.Whilst the cinematography is not to be laughed at and the landscapes, both natural, man made and their juxtaposition in certain shots are more than impressive I found it impossible to really appreciate either whilst surrounded by a narrative that repeatedly attempts to glorify the ideals of one dead and many living fascist dictators.",Hero
633,Shrike_Priest,Art.,10,9 June 2004,"Martial-arts-movies as a genre has forever been plagued by the lack of substance. While no one is going to argue that the classics aren't fun to watch, the truth is that most of them are just flash, with little or no emotion behind the flurry of kicks, sword thrusts and wire-work.This is not the case with Hero.In this movie, director Zhang Yimou, together with the brilliant cinematographer Christopher Doyle, and a stellar cast, has created a modern masterpiece.Every frame of this movie is art, and it's painfully beautiful. And the fights are brilliantly realized.The use of different colour-palettes for each of the segments work beautifully well, and adds a dimension, and a level of polish rarely seen in this genre.But it's not all eye-candy. Despite the fact that not much time is spent on the story, Yimou manages to give every character just the right amount of time to establish itself. You're never wondering ""Why did she/he do that?"", nor do you suffer from an over-explanatory narration. You aren't daddied around.And this is all accented by the brilliant cast. Maggie Cheung, Zhang Ziyi, Tony Leung, and Jet Li all deliver amazing performances. This is a movie where everything clicked. The art direction, the cinematography, the choreography, the music and the acting. Zhang Yimou proved once and for all that martial-arts is just that, art.",Hero

635,tresorstar,Excellent photography end up a lousy movie,2,30 September 2004,"Meretricious, impressive only in appearance. This movie use a imaginary story to reverse a previous judgment about a tyrant, King of Qin. It is OK that director has his own view, but when he tries to change the tradition, he need a better reasoning. There are so many details against the real history 1. No wonder Qin always win, because they never cherish their sword..., there is less than 10 people in the town, Chin army shot 100000000 . They are so rich.... 2. The cloth, setting is not even close to real situation. I don't understand why the hairstyle of King of Qin is copied from the common solider. And suddenly I realized that King of Qin loves his people so much. So much that his hair is not king style but a common solider.Of course, this is Kung Fu genre, not a documentary; there should be imaginative part in the films. But my point is, when the director want ""preach"" or he want to convince us that King of Qin is good. It is a serious topic; he shouldn't use such a fictitious story and so many inconsistent part. How could believe his point of view about the king when this movie is totally not loyal to history? The basic theme of this movie is ridiculous. And director spend so many effort to show ""Chinese style movie"". The Namless and Broken sword has 2 imaginary fights, which are so ludicrous. Because their fighting skill is 2 high to use real combat, so they have to use imagination. Then why director still use reall combat to depict the process of fighting? I have to say this director is really lack of creativity but try to told ""foreigner"" what is Chinese ""Zhen"". And it proved to be a failure. Chan is a good director, especially in scene and color setting. But this film is only a good Chinese painting, I can¡¦t find any Chinese culture behind.",Hero

I decided on the movie based on IMDb's high rating, and was disappointed. I think the plot probably has some merit, and the flashbacks hold some interest, however, the flying through the air with swords? Not for me. The colors and costumes were well done and choreography interesting, but comical. If it had been a comedy, I might have enjoyed it more. The theme of ""hero definition"" was excellent and permeated the story-line from start to finish. I would have enjoyed a film with the plot and theme without the flying through the air--even with the subtitles; that's another thing, there was very little dialogue anyway, so the subtitles were more of a surprise than a hindrance.",Hero

Being from Australia where thankfully this film has enjoyed a wide release. I think a lot of people will go see this film expecting to get a strait up action/martial arts film which well sells this film short of what it is. When viewing this film a group of young man where laughing at several stages of the film (strangely enough not at the martial arts) To these people please do not go and see this film, if you are expecting a fine peace of art please by all means see the film.

638,AlanTeeW,Hollow Spectacle,5,27 August 2004,"I have mixed feelings about the film. Surely it is a amazing work of cinematography, probably of editing, sound editing, sound design, and production design. The layers and layers of presentation are astounding, such as when we are witnessing the hero telling of his first fight, and he remembers looking forward to the fight. In his memory. And then the fight happens--but it's different. Whoa. The integration of color into the layered revelations of ""the hero's"" purposes and motivation is fantastic.I thought the acting was clumsy, almost comical, with the exception of Tony Wai (Broken Sword) and Maggie Cheung (Flying Snow). This movie is not a step forward in the acting--the art--of martial-arts films, especially in the way in which I thought Crouching Tiger was a huge leap forward--and much of that may be due to Chow-Yun Fat and Ang Lee. The cast of Crouching Tiger gets my nod any day over this.I am also very troubled by the connotations in the movie's OVERT political message, which robbed the movie of much of its power for me. Having recently seen Sansho the Bailiff (Japanese), I found the historical romanticism in this film hard to take. This movie is to China what The Patriot is the the U.S.A. Much more shallow, actually.Even with politics aside, I thought CTHD told a much more human story, and is a much better film, if less visually gratifying. I cried for the characters in that movie. I pitied the characters in this one.",Hero

It has an interesting and authentic story, together with wonderful scenery, music, and of course, action. The fighting is at times, almost like ballet and it's accompanied by soft, calm music. The whole film, is just a joy to look at. The locales are almost surreal, though they are actually places around China.

The stories which are not real, the fantasy that is built towards the real story; and it was with that that Zhang Yimou played so magically. Even the slow motion fight scene people failed to understand! Which I refuse to explain. It's a very moving and beautiful movie. The photography and the astonishing use of colors are breathtaking.

I think this is a very good and accurate comment on this film. I personally enjoyed this film a lot because of the cast (Maggie Zhang and Tony Leung are my favourite), the score, the cinematography and even the costume design. It is indeed the largest budget film ever made in China, and with Zhang yimou, it can not be bad.However,the ideology of Hero is a strange and arguable thing. On one hand, the idea of union and sacrifice is perfectly understandable to Chinese people (if not so understandable to people from other parts of the world.) This is the reason for those people who burst into tears. On the other hand, it is somehow overdone and appears to be too ideal. People who fell asleep said the story is hollow and stupid; the film clearly aims to get an Oscar,therefore just a piece of commercial rubbish. I am in between of these two argument, I believe that as the best director of the fifth generation in China, Zhangyimou is ambitious to make something big. And if An Lee can won an Oscar by directing Crouching Tigger, why can't he make it? This motive certainly add the commercial factor in the film. But as Zhangyimou said, he is a Wuxia fan since childhood and always desires to make a film about it. He is now in his prime of career and has gained enough fame to make the world take notice of his talent, I think it is natural that he directed Hero which is so different from his previous works. And now his second Wuxia film is coming out soon, I am looking forward to see it.",Hero

Action, romance, and history are all a part of this movie and how it is all sequenced together is well done. The martial arts scenes show the exotic ways to defend one's self back at a certain time in history. Also it was not only one way shown, but a couple. Jet Lee's character is very well played as he goes through the movie portraying a man who actually could be a ""hero"". One con i may have is that the movie might have had some unrealistic areas.

It requires concentration, but at the same time an open mind to allow this epic story to sweep over you.Let the movie carry you away like rushing water.

So I was prepared to do the same with this film until I read a review by Roger Ebert. Roger said that the best way to accept the unbelievable was to think of this story as myth and legend. Afterall, no one expects mythology to be true to life.I gotta tell you, it worked! My suspension of disbelief during this movie allowed me to appreciate the true beauty of the film. Great scenery, fantastic sets, great acting, an emotional and involving love story, great direction and a story based on the history of China all combined to make an actually great film experience!This movie had jumped just about to the top of my list of all-time favorites.

649,springwinterfall,A work of art with many different angles.,10,6 September 2004,"For those of you who think this movie as a propaganda movie, it's really sad that you ignore the history and knowledge of propaganda. I am a Chinese and grow up in China. I have seen many propaganda movies but this one has nothing similar. This movie is definitely operatic. For those of you get confused about the story, here is the plot. The story has been told three times. First time, Nameless make up a love triangle story but the King reveals that the story is not true. Then the King starts to tell a story from his own view. Of course, this is not true either. Eventually, Nameless told the true story. If you watch the three different versions of the story carefully, it tells you a lot about the characters' personalities. The fake story told by Nameless is a common love triangle story, which shows the limitation of Nameless' view of the ""Tian Xia"". The second story in the King's mind really shows his respect to Broken sword and Snow. The way he thinks how the story should be really touched Nameless' heart. The third story(the real one), really shows the love and passion of broken sword and snow.Another confusion has been the fact that Broken sword has been killed for so many times in the movie. You have to watch it carefully that many killings in the movie are fake ones. Sometimes the story is fake and some other time the victims are just seriously wounded ( pretend to be killed to convince the king).I can't believe some people, especially some Chinese people claim they saw propaganda in this movie. It sounds like they have never seen a propaganda movie and they already forget about Chinese history. The fact at that period of history is that 7 states were fighting with each other for a long period time. Every one of them wanted to conquer all the others. Qin was the strongest one during a particular time. There are no similarity of between what we saw in this movie and the current Taiwan-China, Bush-Iraq issues. The movie is trying to deliver a dream for peace of human kind. Unfortunately, different people have different views. It is true that the king of Qin becomes a brutal one after he unify China. But it's not going to be better if Nameless kill the king. The movie doesn't even particularly praise the king. All the main characters in the movie can be considered to be hero. If you are particularly interested in the King, it's your own view. Clearly, that's not the director's intention at least.I love this movie and I love the style of the director. The most beautiful scene is when moon is dead after fighting with Snow in the fake story. It's simply beautiful and beyond imagination. Many people hate the part where the actors are flying around. If you watch more carefully, they flying around only in imagination and those fake stories. In the real story, none of them are actually flying around. To me, I have no problem to see those characters flying around so elegantly. It's just a fantasy and imagination. I enjoy this more than watching spiderman flying around.",Hero

The action scenes are typical Chinese-styled indulgent impossibilities of both physics and entertainment and the entire goal of this film (which contains less illuminating dialogue than can fill a scene, let alone this ponderous attempt at a movie) is a shameless retelling of the attempt on the life of the hated first emperor of China.The representation of Shi Huang Di is especially ridiculous. Portrayed as a strong, upright individual whose goal is the ""noble"" unification of what was to become China, he bears no resemblance whatsoever to the picture history paints of the first Qin emperor. An insane and overbearing legalist who was so unloved by his court that an assassin was allowed to make an attempt on his life without the slightest intervention from the attending mass of courtiers who supposedly owed him allegiance, he was thoroughly despised throughout the ages following the end of his brief dynasty. Contrary to this undisputed consensus on the first emperor is his portrayal as a man who stands up to his would-be assassin and engages in a farcical pseudo-philosophical debate which further alienates the discerning viewer.I was ashamed to see Quentin Tarantino associate himself with this pathetic piece. None of his films are baldfaced attempts at revisionist history whose sole goal is the unashamed glorification of a nation's manufactured past.

Also it was very interesting to see a metamorphosed Jet Li with a much better acting that his usual movies. Another interesting thing about this movie is the reaction of the public. After seeing Hero I highly recommended it to all my friends though I made sure not revealing a thing more. I noticed most of the audience enjoys it while there are some who say this movie is overrated and their enjoyment wasn't that big. One thing I can tell you for sure: after watching it, either you liked it or not, you will not be sorry for giving up 100 minutes of your life, because you will get to see one of the best Chinese movies ever made and one of the best world-wide movies of the last 2-3 years!",Hero

656,geniusj00,"""Hero""",8,27 August 2004,"The sound of beating drums entices the audience to the suspense of the most masterfully produced Chinese movie ever. For even before, 'Hero' had begun and Nameless (Jet Li) had spoken his first lines of the movie, the audience could sense that this would not be a movie without much talking, but one that would rely on the audience to use their senses and emotions to carry them through the intricate yet at first glance seemingly unsophisticated story line.As unification of China by the King of Qin (Daoming Chen) becomes only a side focus of the movie's murderous plot. At first I was critical that the movie wouldn't work due to its English subtitles, for all speech is done in Chinese, but as the development of the sword fighting develops speech and subtitles become seemingly irrelevant. The plot thickens as Nameless advances toward the King of Qin from the respected one-hundred paces out to a mere ten paces away from the King himself. However, as Nameless advances so does the story behind the movie. The movie's story itself is told in a series of flashbacks by Nameless. Both prior/subsequent and especially during these flashbacks the special effects of material arts and sword-fighting are so often expressed it becomes a welcome tone of the movie, despite realistic or not. The use of dark/contrasting colors with those of vibrant bright colors adds a nice touch to each scene of this epic story. It is initially apparent Nameless has done an important task, killing all three assassins [Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung), and Long Sky (Donnie Yen)] who've been after the King of Qin. Yet unpredictable plot twists and turns lay just one step ahead of the audience at each revelation by Nameless as he enlightens the King of Qin to his anecdote. Overall I would give this film a four out of five stars (eight out of ten) as it kept me quite captivated and I tremendously enjoyed the surprise outcome. I expect 'Hero' to become just that, a hero of the box-office due to its superb plot twists, great scenes of sword-fighting, and good acting.",Hero

What on earth were they thinking?The producers are DARING stupid audiences not to like it. They seem to think that you'll be so distracted by the style of it, and that you'll be so fascinated with a ""period piece"" of history you know nothing about that you will be loathe to admit how often your mind wanders during the interminable fight scenes between invincible fighters who martyr themselves for their own definition of ""hero"".Definitely a matter of the emperor's new clothes.",Hero

As a poor student from Hongkong I do not qualify to be part of the target audience, and am quite disappointed by the filmmaker's misuse of a kickass cast, a large budget, and many interesting aspects of Chinese culture/history.There are many cool concepts that were put into the movie, but are almost always mishandled: For example, the crossbowmen scene--the interesting posture the archers use to tighten their crossbow string was actually depicted in ancient military illustrations. Yet it was immediately marred by the horrible special effects showing the arrows flying into the city--which was too much exaggerated and definitely not nicely done. The use of different monotonal color schemes for different sections of the movie is also a very cool idea, but some of the monotonous building interior are simply ugly. The custom design is extravagant but have neither originality nor historic accuracy. The Qin soldiers rather looks like they are borrowing customs from the roman infantry in the ""Gladiator"". Extolling the ""hero"" (Jet Li), who gave up the chance to kill the tyrant of Qin as he was convinced that Qin Dynasty would unite the whole China (which it did, if only for a few decades) and give the people peace (which it did not, nor was it likely the emperor's intention), director Zhang Yimou unnecessarily sings along with the political agenda of the Chinese government--to unite Taiwan with the People's Republic. The movie lauds the role of the Qin dynasty in uniting China, while ignoring the fact that Emperor Yinzheng was without doubt a tyrant--he enslaves people for his vast building projects, burnt books and buried intellectuals who disagree. Such things are of course encouraged to be forgotten in the new China, because analogous crimes are still being committed by the current government.Hero's strong nationalistic sentiment and lack of taste might not be felt by the average western film-goer seeking a good kungfu fight scene or some artsy cinematography in an oriental setting. For everybody elsethe earlier film ""the Emperor and the Assassin"" offers far superior treatment of the same story and is in every aspect (plot, customs, acting, cinematography, customs, sets--and the characters are actually human beings with emotions, not robots talking about building empires or fighting for humanity) a far better movie. Were ""hero"" mainland China's answer to Ang Lee's ""Crouching tiger"", it is a very pathetic one. Sadly, though the film hardly gets any enthusiastic response from Chinese communities inside/outside mainland china, it is still a reflection of a force in contemporary Chinese culture that is rather twisted: a tendency to de-emphasize human conditions while glorifying national greatness and material wealth.",Hero

While an action film may seem out of place in Zhang's amazing body of work, Hero is nothing short of an Epic in the Kung Fu genre. Like Shane, Gone With the Wind, or Chinatown before it, Zhang takes an existing format and brings a wider breadth to the genre and an artist's view to every aspect of film making. With an eye towards history, myth, legend, life and death, truth, and the perception of many truths; Zhang masterfully melds them all with a familiar genre and a story line that is nothing short of a creation myth for Imperial China.With amazing locations unique to China, flawlessly incorporating vast vistas with the inner vistas of the mind, Zhang takes us along on a spiritual journey in the life of the perfect assassin (Jet Li). Using a twisted flashback reminiscent of Rashomon, with the addition of the lush use of vibrant colors and imaginative sets, Zhang unfurls the enlightenment of the soul of a vengeful Nameless assassin in his single minded pursuit of his quest.This film is a revelation and an impeccably crafted masterpiece. Zhang perfectly balances the campy, physics defying, tradition of wire work Kung Fu films with a deeply philosophical story of rebirth and personal sacrifice. While some political overtones may distress some viewers, these should not stand in the way of appreciating the masterful crafting of one of the best films ever made in this genre or I dare say any other.I most strenuously recommend this film as utterly entertaining, deeply moving and surprisingly thought provoking. I hear that Miramax may have butchered the American version a bit as well as changing the interpretation of a rather important two symbol phrase that holds a key to a deeper understanding of the films subtext, but the Director's cut is already available on DVD and lets just say that I have the DVD on order now.Enjoy.9/10",Hero
662,TobascoKid,Dig the change up and go rent it.,8,29 December 2004,"Alright, since this came out in theaters a long time ago the question really is whether this film is a valuable ninety-six minutes of your life spent or if you should do something else, like drinking beer while you clean the garage. First off, this movie IS a lot like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon only because there are big kung-fu, sword and other really cool exotic weapons battles. Also, both have that epic flavor to them, you know like with the scenery and the music and costumes and all that talk about Zen and climbing the mountain and all. Oh yeah, everyone was Chinese. Other than that, at least to a good old boy like myself, that was about it. CTHD was a love story, but with a lot of martial arts. Hero is really more of, well, a hero story. So all of yall can quit comparing the two because they are apples and oranges. I like to keep my reviews short so here it is. To the Tobasco Kid this was worth your hour and a half time. I guess if you have half a brain you can follow it, and it keeps you interested until the end waiting to see what happens to the hero and the Emperor and the slow parts don't drag it down too much. My score: ""Go ahead and dig up the change and rent it while it is still in the primo section at the video store and don't wait for it to get downgraded to the regular DVD section (I think that is 4 stars of of 5 for DVD's)"". In my opinion, it is worth the $3.96 plus part of a Saturday afternoon. Just send the kids to their room to play Nintendo and tell the wife that you are trying to get more intellectual by watching foreign movies. Maybe they will leave you alone long enough to watch it.",Hero

665,Londongwailo,Visually stunning,10,10 October 2004,"I went to see 'Hero' having read some negative comments on the script/plot line. Fortunately those fears were unfounded - Hero is a visually stunning epic. The choreography and photography are first rate, with some truly unforgettable scenery and martial arts.The multiple flashbacks a la Rashomon could be confusing, but thankfully the careful use of colors to ""mark"" each version of events helps to keep the momentum going. Admittedly Jet Li is a bit distant for a leading character, but this is a relatively minor quibble.Anyhow, this is more than compensated for by a show-stealing performance by Maggie Cheung. She delivers a whole spectrum of emotions (from passion to cold murder) with great screen presence, and the heartbreaking scenes at the end were perfectly handled.All in all, a masterful performance. Let's hope the upcoming House of Daggers manages to deliver to this level of quality acting and filming!",Hero
666,K_Whymark,Lovely and Evil,3,26 September 2004,"Visually this is a beautiful movie, however at it's heart it feels like propaganda meant to explain why it is okay that the Chinese government massacred the students at Tiananmen Square, why it's okay if they may attack Taiwan to unify the country and why Tibet must be occupied: it's for the greater good. So when you see the scene where the defenseless calligraphy students are killed by the King of Qin, remember he didn't want to do it, he just doing it for the good of China 'Our Nation' (a phrase coined by Mao Tse Tung and force down the throats of his subjects). The suffering or death of individuals doesn't matter as long as the greater good of the masses is served. It carefully promotes the ""One China"" myth invented by the government to explain China's expansion and absorption of places like Tibet.It's really part of China see? Just like so much of Europe was *really* part of Germany...Speaking of Germany: This movie is on par with the worst propaganda the Nazi's created. I can only hope that people who are drawn in by the great cast, or beautiful cinematography are not so fooled that they let the evil propaganda at the end of the movie to sneak into their brains. I can see now how Joseph Goebbels (Nazi Propaganda Minister) was able to fool so many educated people. You just shroud your evil argument with beautiful images so that the victims swallow it whole. I don't discourage you from seeing the movie, just don't be afraid to talk about what it really is about.",Hero

669,AdrianPK,Hero is the absolute wuxia masterpiece!,10,20 February 2020,"It's strange to consult a thesaurus for words that mean ""beautiful"" while I'm writing a review of a martial arts epic. But that's what Hero does to its audience. The gravity-defying duels between swordsmen are some of the most spectacular you'll ever see.
As the film opens, the king honors a warrior called Nameless, who has slain three famous assassins that threatened the throne during the conquest. The reward: a private meeting with the king. This hero, played perfectly by international martial arts legend Jet Li, grants the king's wish; he relates the stories of how he outwitted these legendary killers-Broken Sword (Tony Leung), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung), and Sky (Donnie Yen).
In the style of Rashomon, Nameless's stories are offered to us in multiple, contradictory flashbacks. Each story he relates raises the king's suspicion and requires a revision. Thus, Nameless and his targets are portrayed in a variety of relationships, sometimes meeting different fates. Each enthralling flashback is portrayed in a distinct array of colors.In one, Nameless and Sky meet in a spectacular duel that's as much a match between their minds as it is between their blades. In another, Nameless helps Broken Sword and Flying Snow defend a calligraphy school from the oncoming forces of the king's warriors. This involves deflecting relentless torrents of arrows that are launched in a siege that resembles the ferocity of The Two Towers' Battle of Helm's Deep. Nameless opposes this siege in order to gain the killers' trust, to learn their weakness, and to defeat them using their own passions for one another. Zhang Ziyi, sporting the same youthful ego and impertinence that she portrayed in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, plays a key role here as Broken Sword's servant, Moon. Two more astonishing clashes-one a breathtaking ballet in a storm of falling yellow leaves, the other a battle on the surface of a magnificent lake-are each worth the price of admission; it's unlikely you'll see anything so memorable all year.
But the most important clash is the one between the hero's narratives and the king's questioning. Nameless is clearly superior to those whose weapons he has claimed and set down before the king. But what has made him such an unparalleled warrior? And what will he ask of the king now that he has performed this feat as a volunteer?
To say more about the plot would be to spoil the story's most interesting twist. And besides, there is much to say in honor of the cast and crew.Nameless is a perfect role for Jet Li. The part asks little of his acting talents (fortunately) and much from his athletic abilities. Similarly, Donnie Yen (Blade II, Shanghai Knights) turns Sky into a man who gets right down to business, letting his sword do the talking.Hero also burns with immediacy and relevance. As China struggles with the division between Beijing and Taiwan, Zhang Yimou poses a heartfelt challenge. He acknowledges the value of unification and peace. He knows that militant resistance of the empire's progress can lead only to more violence and loss. But he reminds the viewer that the peculiarity of unique, diverse cultures produces valuable, irreplaceable rewards ... and people. It is as if the storyteller cannot find a satisfactory conclusion to his own epic.
Thus, American viewers may be unsettled by the conclusion, as there seems to be no room for democracy in Hero's paradigm. In a worldview that reveres the will of a conqueror over the will of a benevolent God, ""peace"" comes at a cost that will give no one true peace. That is why, in the end, Hero remains a conflicted, colorfully turbulent film. By the time the climactic challenge occurs, few will find themselves unmoved by the king's good intentions; but after his bloody campaigns, he is not the man who earns the title ""hero.""Seen in this light, Hero's distinct, aerobatic duels come to represent the power of art to communicate ideas across borders and languages, from common people to kings, emperors, and presidents. The story's emphasis on the art of calligraphy is connected to its exhibitions of swordsmanship-in developing an artful style of writing, Broken Sword and Flying Snow prove that the pen can indeed be mightier than the sword. This metaphor, along with the film's explorations of conscience, fidelity, trust, and responsibility, make Hero ultimately an insightful and rewarding achievement.",Hero
670,dturk-2,Breathtaking epic!,10,5 November 2004,"I am not familiar with the genre which this movie represents, so I am not competent to comment on how well it works -- or doesn't work -- within its constraints.However, I have a long background in appreciating samurai movies (well, that dates me!) so I relate to this movie from that perspective.With those caveats, let me say uniquivocally that this is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen!Each frame is exquisite, yet the human dimension is not overwhelmed by the emphasis on color and composition. I certainly was moved by the death of the lovers and by Nameless' stolid fatalism at the end.Quite frankly, I was so in wonder at this movie that I think my mouth was open in astonishment during the entire film.It had the emotional depth of opera, dance, and the greatest war epics like Ran. It's use of CGI may have been wanting to some aficionados of that technique, but I thought the overwhelming forces produced by these effects compared favorably to those in Lord of the Rings.The fight scenes were perhaps too dance-like for some, but for me, they were a transporting experience.Well, I should stop gushing.

672,xwei,"A Political Movie, In Fact",7,26 January 2005,"This movie which has a historical context may be difficult to understand if you do not know the details regarding this time in Chinese history. You may be astounded by the scenery, the music and the martial arts. However, this movie, as pretty as it looks, is a piece of work which delivers a secret political message which happened not to be my favorite one.This king in the movie, Emperior Qin, was one of the most ruthless governors in Chinese history. He conquered other kingdoms and united China not in a merciful way but as barbaric as he could. After he united the Chinese territory, he killed many intellectuals, collected and burned books and applied the cruelest laws upon his people to take away their rights such as the freedom of speech (if the Chinese people have any right now) and freedom of mobilization. The period under his governing was a dark age and his empire collapsed right after he died mostly because of his brutal governing.In this movie, the assassins all failed because ""Nameless"" could not kill the king, eventually because he came to believe that ""To Unite the Country"" is more important over a person's identity, nationality and suffering under the government of the worst leader. Associating that message with the communist dictatorship in China, you can see what the director intended to tell you. And in fact, it is why Chinese movies are usually under very tight scrutiny by Chinese Media Inspection system. A lot of movies that talked about human rights are being banned in China but this one was the government's baby.I was a big fan of Yimou Zhang (the director) since he made ""Hong Gao Liang"" and really liked movies such as ""To live"", ""Ju Dou"" and even the ""You Hua Hao Hao Shuo"". But in recent years, his fame has apparently distanced him from the common life of the majority of Chinese people. His recent movies, as beautiful as they are, seem to have no soul to me.",Hero

The movie is enjoyable to watch, and you'll be thinking about it long after you watch it. The beauty of the film remained intact despite the potential for gore and disgust. It left a lot to the imagination which was very exciting. Performances by all the actors were very good--nothing too corny or out of place to make you cringe. Although people want to compare this to CTHD, I think the comparison is needless and this movie should really be recognized and distinguished from a rivalrous love-story.",Hero
674,kingsigy,A very touching and emotional film.,8,23 December 2009,"Hero is a film I've seen numerous times over the years since I first saw it in theaters back in 2004. It ignited my flame for kung fu and it touched me with it's deep story about death for the greater good of one's country (even if it's message is actually Pro-Communist). Having just re-watched it (on a rather disappointing Blu-Ray), I can still say that Hero is fantastic. The cinematography is out of this world (and is still one of the most beautiful things to be captured on film) and the action choreography is thrilling. It may not be realistic, but the movie stands for something much deeper than that. The plot is very daunting the first time you watch it, but after awhile you begin to understand exactly what is occurring. To explain the story would almost ruin the joy of discovering what is happening, but I will sum up the initial beginning. Nameless (Jet Li) is being brought in front of the King of Qin because he has slain three of the greatest assassin's in the land. He is to receive a reward for this gallantry. During this retelling of how he defeated one of the assassin's, the King notices something is off with Nameless' story. This leads into the rest of the movie, a guessing game of who done it or what really happened. Once you figure it all out, the plot is actually extremely basic. What it contains, though, is tremendous depth of character. The many assassin's that Nameless faces, Broken Sword (Tony Leung), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Sky (Donnie Yen) all place their lives on the line for the unification of China. Regardless of how blatant the movie wants to promote Communism as the greatest, one can relate with these characters. They are true patriots and seeing their courageous deeds nearly brings a tear to me eye. The acting is fairly good, even if Zhang Ziyi contributes little to the overall story. Jet Li doesn't have the most physically demanding role of his career, but he still gets to perform many spin kicks and jumps. Seeing him and Donnie Yen in a rematch (after Once Upon a Time in China 2) is just amazing, especially considering how Yen has almost gotten better over the years. Tony Leung was always a great dramatic actor and his performance here is very subdued and endearing. His talk about the king towards the end will make you question your own rivalries. Maggie Cheung also steals the spotlight in most of her scenes. As I mentioned, too, the cinematography is stellar. Most of the action takes place on what seems like a poetic dream of landscape. CGI is used to enhance certain moments of terror or plight. One memorable scene in a section of forest with falling leaves will leave you breathless. The music, scored by Tan Dun, is also some of the greatest music I've ever had the benefit of listening to. Most of the themes have been stuck in my head for the past five years, but seeing this movie again really did make me humble. There really isn't much bad that I can say about the film. I suppose some of the CGI could be noted or even that the plot, after being solved, doesn't hold much gravity. Being a Wuxia Pen film, the action may be a bit too over-the-top for viewers of traditional martial arts films. But that honestly shouldn't matter when watching the film. You're being transported to a land where National Pride means everything. You don't fight because you're a bad-ass, you fight to gain a sense of pride. It's a very dramatic and gripping tale and I recommend it to everyone, even people who dislike foreign films.",Hero
675,erichnorton,2nd worst film I've seen,1,4 February 2005,"Well, where to start? OK, I know, here: nothing happens. You think something may have been happening, part way through the film, but you discover that none of that really happened. And when something does happen, it is either a) completely pointless, or b) based on pretentious and overblown philosophical ideas, which can actually be summed up as ""the end justifies the means"". To convey this you get a lot of use of single colours (all one colour of yellow leaves...which later turn to all one colour of red leaves, all green hanging silks, etc. etc.) and lots of lingering looks on people's faces after they have just a) been betrayed b) been killed c) been betrayed and killed or have d) betrayed, killed or betrayed and killed someone else - apart from the fact that nobody actually gets betrayed, and nobody gets killed until the final 3 minutes of the film (apart from hundreds of extras, of course). It's like a grossly inflated version of one of those poor stories that 9 year-olds make up which end with ""... it had all been a dream"". The fight scenes are highly stylised with lots of spinning and twirling miles away from the opponent.In short, an hour-and-a-half film that seems like 4 hours. A friend of mine actually liked the film but refused to believe that it was only 1 1/2 hours - he thought it must have been 3.The only film worse than this? ""The End of Violence""",Hero

In the first version the storyline was really simple, and the characters were rather simple, they seem not thinking a lot. However in the next storytelling, it gets more sophisticate, there was more emotional feeling on the characters and how they acted. The last version revealed the true story and more elements were added on this time. The end was sad but it reflected the main idea of the story. The fighting scenes were okay but a bit over exaggerated. In the scene of two guys trying to kill the King, they could well have done it by night and in a more silent manner rather than entering the palace beating hundreds of guards.

680,a_john_w,Orb in the movie? I think so.,10,27 March 2005,"Fist of all I would like to say wow! When I watched the film for the first time it was like looking at a beautiful painting for the first time. It felt like pure art and that is exactly what it is. Art. The film is about a warrior who has defeated the three most threatening assassins to his king. In return for his efforts he is awarded money, land but most of all the privilege to sit within ten paces of the king. As the warrior tells the king of how he defeated these three brilliant assassins we go back in time and get a quite stunning visual interpretation of the warriors story. However the king is not convinced of this story as he knows of these assassins and almost lost his life to one of them. What we get now is the story from how the king thinks these events unfolded and this includes the king thinking this warrior has defeated these assassins because he knew he could get close enough to the king to kill him himself. Is the king right? I don't want to give anything away because this was an absolutely incredible experience for me and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. The movie has many layers and unfolds very exquisitely bringing out almost every emotion we have as human beings. Not many films can do that.Now time for me to explain the tittle of my review. What is an orb? We know they are in the shape of a ball, small and fast moving. They are also sighted in areas that are ""haunted"" or areas that have a lot of history or/and both. Orbs are not visible to the naked eye and they are either caught on camera and rarely captured on home video. Nobody really knows what an orb is. Some say electricity causes them and some say they are a form of ghost. Either way I have seen a lot of movies and never in my whole life have I seen an orb captured in a motion picture. Until now.The first couple of times I did not notice it. But yesterday I watched ""Hero"" and noticed something in the corner of the screen. I thought nothing of it at first but I wanted to be sure so I skipped back a scene and watched very carefully. If you want to see this orb skip through the movie until the time passed says exactly 1 hour 26 minutes and 39 seconds. This object which I believe is a orb is visible for exactly one second and it starts off at the top right hand corner of the screen and ends up in the bottom middle of the screen. When the DVD is on pause I suggest you zoom in as much as you can and press the pause button another nineteen times and you can see the path it takes from start to finish. Now that's something you won't find in the special features.",Hero
681,kunal-1008276,The movie beautifully shows us how martial art can be seen as an art form.,8,24 August 2015,"Star Castings:- Jet Li as Nameless, Donnie Yen as Sky, Zhang Ziyi as Moon, Tony Leung Chiu Wai as Broken Sword, Maggie Cheung as Flying Snow, Chen Daoming as Qin Emperor.Director:- Zhang Yimou.Hero a 'Wuxia' film directed by Zhang Yimou is a martial arts extravaganza defining the styles and lives of its fighters within Chinese tradition. The film is based on a story from the Warring States period, which depicts Jing Ke's (a confidant of the crown prince of Yan State) assassination attempt on the King of Qin in 227 BC. The storyteller is Nameless (Jet Li), who comes to the Emperor Qin claiming that he killed three of the most dangerous enemy of the Qin. Qin dreams of uniting all of China's warring kingdoms under his rule, his plans to end war. The king after hearing the story from Nameless allows him to sit withing a close approach. Nameless true intention was to assassinate the king to bring peace and to take revenge from the king for murdering his entire family. But in the end, Nameless finally realize the words of Broken sword ""All Under Heaven"" as the emperor could be cruel but his idea of uniting china's seven warring states was good and can bring an end to the war.The Warring States period (476–221 BC) is a historical period in ancient China following the ""Spring and Autumn period"" and concluding with the victory of the state of Qin in 221 BC, creating a unified China under the Qin dynasty. Director Zhang Yimou was very articulated to his artistic expression through this film, which often submerged the political point. The entire film was highly influenced from traditional Chinese Paintings, Calligraphy and Poetry which can be seen as the film showcased MARTIAL ART as an ""Art form"" rather a ""Militaristic combat technique"".Like both 'Crouching Tiger' and 'House of the Flying Daggers', Hero is a modern-day ""wuxia"" film that utilizes wire technology for its impressive and beautiful action scenes. Unlike 'Crouching Tiger', however, Hero has a tendency to overuse these elements. Zhang Yimou occasionally becomes so enamored with the colors and landscapes that they seem to preempt the story, which is the real heart of the film. On the other hand, the script is undeniably good. As Nameless gets closer to the king, not only are the viewers coming closer to the truth of the story, but as it turns out, they are getting closer to understanding the heart of the king himself. Overall, Hero is just another fine example of why China's contemporary ""wuxia"" films have gathered such a following worldwide. I highly recommend it.",Hero

Still, what comes to this movie as an experience, for me it doesn't matter really why somebody has made movie like that, as it isn't literally a political movie, direct propaganda, or something alike, as I see it.Maybe it is because I have luxury to be distanced enough from Chinese situation, and politics. Maybe played other circumstances in as well.My conclusion, specially after first viewing, was a great spiritual experience which gave me plenty of insights to figure about for quite a while. For that, for me, this movie is quite unique and I consider it to be one of the best movies.Then again, I understand other point of views. Just wish I could share even my experience to others as well.;)E/X",Hero
685,cmegohp,A pure delight to watch,10,25 May 2005,"This movie was the best movie I have seen in a very long time. It was a masterpiece of art and action and cinematography. The storyline was excellent and the action was such an added bonus. Stunningly beautiful is the only way to describe this film with it's use of bold splashes of color, the uses of symbolism and the locations used are simply visions of beauty. The storyline doesn't get tangled and twisted up between the powerful and highly detailed action sequences, everything flows so beautifully throughout this movie. The acting is superb with pure emotion colliding onto the screen, nothing in this movie overpowers it or understates it. The action scenes are very tasty morsels. I've never seen martial art moves like the ones in this movie. They are meticulously thought out and so well choreographed. Like I said before, everything just flows so well in this movie. I purchased Hero on a whim and I am so thankful I did. I have never seen such a beautiful movie in all my life, the scenery, the colors, the story, the acting, the action. This is a must see!!!",Hero
686,aj_malt,A minor visual flaw - No blood!!,9,26 February 2006,Did anyone notice that Zhang Yimou is so inclined towards making a visually excellent film that he doesn't use blood even when shadow and snow's bodies are pierced by a sword in the end. Minor details though. A brilliantly captured film. Akira Kurosawa used paintings to complete his storyboard. I believe that Zhang Yimou did so too. Every sequence is beautiful. Another Asian film which can boast of stunning visual imagery along with a brilliant storyline is the Bollywood film Black directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali.Everyone should check that one out too for world class performances. The Direction,Hero
687,kle4x-1,"visually and technically brilliant, but it is propaganda for oppression",5,13 January 2006,"I gave the film a 5 to reflect a 9 for its brilliant aesthetics and a 1 for its abhorrent message.This movie is superb in its artistry, technical skill and engaging story. Unfortunately, if you look just a bit below the surface, this is an apologia for Chinese repression of ethnic minorities and ""renegade"" provinces. Though set in the warring states period, the ultimate message of the movie, as evidenced by ...SPOILER ALERT...ITS COMING NOW...Don't LOOK IF YOU Haven't SEE THE MOVIE...Jet Li's acquiescence to his own murder is that the needs of the individual, no matter how just, must be sacrificed to the cause of order. The other Chinese states, by wanting to remain free, cause disorder and war. If the King of Qin can conquer and rule them, there will be peace and less loss of life. Jet Li, who in flashbacks shows us his exploits in killing enemies of the king, is allowed close enough to the king to be able to use his finely honed killing ability. The king eventually sees through the ruse and ascertains Li's true purpose is to assassinate him. The king then engages Li in debate, defending his brutal conquest as the only way to peace and the ending of senseless slaughter. While he is brutal, his rule would ensure the end of war, and thus no more rebellious deaths. Li must decide between freedom and chaos, or conquest and order. His self-sacrifice is meant to be a lesson to people to not put their own desires ahead of order and the state. So, all you Tibetans, Taiwanese, Uighurs and other restive peoples in China, stop being so selfish and just submit to the rule of the CCP. Of course Leni Riefenstahl also made visually engrossing and technically proficient films, but in service to Hitler and Nazi ideology. Is Hero much different?",Hero
688,yusongzhou106,Clever plot...a classic,10,6 July 2005,"Great fighting...but you should first understand the historical background. Takes place in of the most interesting time periods. Throughout the years people of told numerous stories of assassination attempts on the great Emperor Qing. This one is by far the most dramatic, action packed of all. This movie has a wonderful plot that will leave you in shock! All the characters come to life with the wonderful acting of the actors. Zhang, the master at creating martial arts classics delivers us his best work of Hero. The movie is flawless combined with amazing soundtracks. Hero is definitely Jet Li's best performance. Don't miss out on the story of an ancient empire that once rocked the world!",Hero
689,wijaya_adi,Most audiences are missing the main points of the movie,10,12 May 2006,"Many audiences, especially the western audiences have misunderstood the messages of this movie. This is not a movie about choosing tyranny for a greater cause such as peace. It is about choosing peace over revenge.In the movie, the king of Qin was close to unify the whole country and thus end the continuous wars. The assassins all have grudge against the king. But they realized that if they kill the king, the whole nations will plunge into another endless wars. Killing the king won't give them back what they have lost. But it will surely cause more suffering to the people. So they choose to let go their revenge and even their lives for a greater cause, the peace. It is like what the nameless said in the movie, the ideal warrior will know when to lay down the sword.",Hero
690,alm19,Too much,2,12 March 2006,"This movie was just too much over the top artsy for me. This left the rest of the plot confusing, and at the end of the movie you are left wondering what the point of all the characters actions was. I have no problem with people enjoying the artful scenes in this movie. They were good in my opinion. The problem with this movie is that the movie doesn't change gears enough to fill in a coherent plot. The entire movie is the same artsy fight scene after another. These wind up being too long, and you just want them to end already. A good movie would use this to complement the story, but in this movie, the story plays second. I would recommend watching the first minute of each scene, or just looking at stills of the movie.",Hero
691,myname_is_gladiator,Hero was a false story,3,9 September 2005,"I watched only trailer,but that is enough to form my opinion against it.Hero was filled with pretense and falsity not only visually but historically.YiMou Zhang made a beautiful fictitious film without true grand spectacle a historical film are supposed to has.the so-called battle scenes are all funny ones:Qin army fired arrows not towards enemies but far into civilians in houses;also,the costume of soldiers of Qin army were seriously out of accord with real history;Those pupils and their teacher were quite fools that they stayed to paint in spite of coming arrows.Right pretense!The martial art designs are another failure:Jet Li was like a acrobat flying everywhere and used supernatural abilities that was a misleading and a exaggeration of true Kong Fu. So,if you would like to watch true epic films from China,""The emperor and The assassin"",""The great conqueror's concubine""and""The emperor's shadow"" are my recommendations.",Hero
692,alamafroz-25681,Mesmerizing movie.,8,10 August 2016,"Hero is visually pleasing and artistically beautiful masterpiece by Zhang Yimou. It is a Chinese martial art film and the director presents this majestic art from using minimal bloodshed in the movie. Zhang Yimou re-tells his version of the assassination attempt of King of Qin( 220 - 210 BC ) with Jet Li as his protagonist - ""Nameless"". This movie also brings up the subject of Maoism.Hero is a rare movie which blends storytelling into a visual poem. The color composition it blows your mind away, even more so when you realize the significance of each color with respect to the story. It is the central grace of the movie and the director, Zhang Yimou, reportedly made incredible efforts to fulfill his requirement. There is mesmerizing natural imagery and costumes in the film which takes us back to the ancient china.The acting was good, though at some places it felt a bit unreal and forced. Music in the movie complemented the visual poem Yimou was trying to create. In conclusion, I would like to say that I liked this movie a lot and would recommend this to anyone who appreciates natural beauty and art.",Hero
693,ygblue,one of the most beautiful films,9,13 April 2006,"I really like the beautiful/colorful scenes and music in this film. Being the most successful commercial film in domestic(china) history, although there are many criticisms about it, I think it will get the positive admission at last. Some fans don't like it because they think the film praised the emperor who was really tyrannical and the film isn't artistic enough, but I think the reason is really ridiculous. Everyone knows the director is an artistic film director, and he never directs a commercial film before. But he made a big surprise to everyone. This film introduced a commercial way for Chinese film industry. Before that, every Chinese film is low budget and low box office revenue, including the director's own films. Many Chinese directors shoot their films for international awards, because the awards can bring back investment. If no box office revenue, how will the capitalist/company invest the film？ At last, the film Hero indicates a path: high budget, high revenue.",Hero
694,dataa7079,My review w/o spoiler,9,18 September 2005,"When people take the time out of their lives to go to the theaters and see a movie, usually people go there to escape and be submerged in the story. Hero definitely did this for me. I was so into this movie that I hadn't realized how much time had passed. Most movies I believe spend most of their funds getting a Star in their movie, then it goes to the special effects and the story suffers from it. Hero presents a story within stories that doesn't leave you hanging. Magnificent story of warriors dedicated to their mission and would do anything to achieve it. The visual's were excellent, the use of bold colors in the story made it easy to connect it with the whole plot. The acting was great and the fighting scenes weren't bad at all. This movie has it all. As an American who really didn't know much of the famous actors in the East, they were definitely marvelous and remarkable.",Hero

696,jessica_d_hermosa,The Meanings Behind Hero's Colors,9,28 September 2005,"According to Robert Mackey's interview with Christopher Doyle (the cinematographer of Hero) which was pubished in the New York Times, the choice of colors for the film ""Hero"" was aesthetic, not symbolic. However, as viewers, we are bound to create our own meanings for the color choices based on the emotion and mood of the scene. Here are the few reasons I thought of to explain each color choice. Red was used in the first version of the story wherein Broken Sword and Flying Snow are portrayed as foolish lovers ruled by jealousy and anger. Red may have been used to emphasize the furious passion between the couple. Blue was used in the Emperor's version of the story. It complemented the subdued, more rational re-telling. Blue brings to mind ""calmness"" which can be used to describe the King's version as well. Blue also highlighted the gloominess evoked in the scene wherein Nameless and Broken Sword grieve for Flying Snow through a sword fight. White was used in the final version of the story which was the true version. White usually connotes purity so it is a good choice of color for the true version which is untainted, uncolored. White, a color associated with death and mourning in Asian culture, also foreshadowed the death of the key characters.Green is usually associated with memory, with cognition. It is a perfect choice of color for the flashbacks. Black, the dominant color in scenes where Nameless and the Emperor converse, could have been used as a strong contrast against the colored versions to differentiate the actual narration from the various stories. Notice that black is the color worn by the government officials, the soldiers, the emperor's advisers, and even by Nameless when he affiliates himself with the empire. Black may also symbolize the neutrality of the government.These are merely my own rationalizations and should not be taken to be factual. After all, colors do not have exclusive meanings. The use of color in Hero was a really effective way of making sure the viewers understand the delineations between the different versions of the story.",Hero
697,jjy7,No plot,2,14 December 2005,"Hero is basically a pretty painting without context. The plot holes are so numerous is it impossible not to be distracted by it while watching the movie. ZhangYiMou is more concerned about making the movie look nice than developing the characters and storyline. He arbitrarily added Zhang Ziyi's character just because she is his new ""protege"" and he wants to use her to get back at his last ""protege"" Gong Li(Zhang Ziyi looks like Gong Li's younger sister) by making her more famous. The director also spent 1 million dollar painting the red scene the precise color of red he wanted and yet refused to pay his extras more than 1 dollar a day. It is probably an entertaining movie for people who just want to see some Asian kung fu. Sleep fest for anyone already familiar with the genre.",Hero

699,sharkyfinns,My god was it BAD,1,22 November 2005,OK i am a fan of Jet Lee Movies BUT this suck ass!!!!!wire fighting i think is the lowest form of entertainment (Lower than Mimes)and that thing with the colours! I was sitting through that movie watching my watch more than the film after suffering for so long with the fights scenes that never really happened crap over and over again. Wost thing though after it finished on the way out of the cinema and everyone saying 'thats the greatest movie ever' i walk past a sign explaining the colours. Which for me was a bit late after suffering it.So a note to anyone going to watch this movie. 1. Read stuff about the colours 2. Be prepared to have a head ache 3. Know there is a lot of refuting 4. Have a few drinks before had as you will not care about the plot holes.,Hero
700,dtenenbo,Colorful Propaganda,1,19 December 2005,"The message of Hero is quite clear: the idea of Greater China is more important than the death and the suffering of millions. At a time when China is dangling its war toys over Taiwan, it is unacceptable for Western viewers to endorse this piece of over-produced, government-sponsored, dogmatic trash.Particularly surprising is the promotion of this film by the liberal media. Roger Ebert of Chicago Tribune, David Edelstein of Slate, Charles Taylor of Salon, and many others have wholeheartedly endorsed Hero. In so doing, they have implicitly legitimated its reactionary political message. The only critic (that I know of) who saw through the film's glossy facade was J. Hoberman of The Village Voice, who wrote of the film's ""sanctimonious traditionalism"" and its ""glorification of ruthless leadership and self-sacrifice on the altar of national greatness."" I, for one, sign my name under Hoberman's final pronouncement: Hero is nothing more than ""fascinating fascism.""",Hero

Well but they were mostly Chinese, but when i saw this movie i see some Japanese people in it with ""chinese"" sword and i say to myself ""wow! how did they pull that off, i mean aren't Japanese and Chinese people enemies?, well getting off the subject"" i think this movie is good, not good but good, just good:)i am happy to inform you that hero is one of the best action film,yet, by this new director and i would like to see more of his movies! The martial arts that was in the movie was well directed and the part where Jet Li fights this legendary martial art dude it was the best part of the movie. The armies that they show in the film was very realistic and very time well spent because it was pretty cool. This may be a little off subject but; one thing i don't get about the movie is how the servant to the emperor can go near him but the law is that no person can be 10 paces from the him. Why didn't HERO tries to become one of the servant that carries stuff to the emperor and kills his then, or why didn't anyone do it that way! But anyways its a pretty good movie and everyone that has not seen it should because it is a wonderful experience because of all the beautiful scenery in nature. Like the yellow forest with the two girls in red frothing and JEt Li and the other guy fighting in the Lake. Well Go Hero!",Hero

It is very delicate and fine, so you must watch more than one time to understand what happen and what movie idea. If you don't like fighting movies, watch this one and can be that you change your mind about that genre. Of course specials effects is very good too, so it don't take you boring and time waste. I strongly recommend it to see all who can do it.",Hero
