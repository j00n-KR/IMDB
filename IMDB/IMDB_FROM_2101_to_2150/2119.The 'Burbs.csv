family with wife Carrie Fisher and son Cory Danziger. But a strange new family has moved into the house next door and he spends his week trying to figure out
what their story is.Meet the Klopeks who have all the characteristics of a Charles Addams creation.
When one of their neighbors, elderly Gale Gordon goes missing without an explanation imaginations run wild.At least the imaginations of neighbors Bruce Dern and Rick Ducommon are
stirred and they get Hanks involved. Dern has a real flair for comedy with his
creation of this man who loves all things military. Ducommon is a man with a
big imagination and no clue.With the title I thought this would be a general satire on suburban living. It
isn't but that's all right. It's a very funny film with a nice twist for an ending.I also have to say Corey Feldman has one of his best roles though if the creators of The 'Burbs are giving some commentary on 80s American youth.
He's kind of a Greek chorus of comment himself on the stupid goings on of the
adults.Very funny stuff, catch it if you can.",The 'Burbs
1,Leofwine_draca,And you thought your neighbours were weird...,9,25 June 2012,"Like a lot of Joe Dante's output, THE 'BURBS is a film that's impossible to dislike. Yes, it may be cheesy, it may be obvious, and some of the characters in it may be more than a little irritating, but for the most part this is a fun-filled thrill ride tinged with Halloween chills and a healthy dose of paranoia.Of course, the real joke is the supposedly ordinary neighbours who spend the movie spying on the newcomers inhabiting a ramshackle old house are far more bizarre than the would-be villains of the piece. Tom Hanks is the everyday Joe who's taken a week off work and becomes increasingly unhinged as the film progresses; Carrie Fisher is his ever-exasperated wife. Rick Ducommun, who bags one great gag-scene in which he threatens to eat his neighbours out of house and home, is the loudmouth conspiracy nut. Bruce Dern in a particularly inventive piece of casting is an ex-army loon with a fine line in gadgets, and Corey Feldman, who has grown up a lot since THE LOST BOYS, is good fun as a teenage slacker.The creative casting alone is reason to keep watching, but Joe Dante brings a lot of life to Dana Olsen's script. Dante has a natural love of cinema in all its forms which makes even his clichés seem like a lot of fun. The ghoulish antics surrounding the creepy old house are often hilarious, like the scene involving the femur and the neighbourly house call. Henry Gibson steals his scenes as the sinister doctor and watch out for Dick Miller in a particularly engaging cameo. The climax is completely spectacular and ends the film on a real high, paying off on all the kooky tension that's come before it.",The 'Burbs
2,SnoopyStyle,fun and funny movie,8,13 April 2015,"Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks) is staying home for a week of vacation. There are strange things going on next door at the Klopeks who moved in last month. His friend Art Weingartner (Rick Ducommun) has wild theories about them. Along with military vet Mark Rumsfield (Bruce Dern) and Ricky Butler (Corey Feldman), they try to convince him of the worst. Mark's wife Bonnie (Wendy Schaal) finds neighbor Walter Seznick's dog Queenie running loose. Walter is nowhere to be found. Ray's wife Carol (Carrie Fisher) insists on the best and drag the Rumsfields to visit the creepy Klopeks.This is such a fun premise of nosy neighbors in the suburbs. Tom Hanks is a great everyman and he has a lot of fun. The guys are basically full grown boys and the Klopeks are the creepy neighborhood bogeymen. It's not suppose to be scary. It's a bit wacky. It's just a fun time.",The 'Burbs
3,mark.waltz,Everybody loves Ray....except the new neighbors.,2,16 March 2016,"It is so ironic that Tom Hanks' first name here happens to be Ray, because from the moment I started watching this, it reminded me of the darkness behind the sitcom ""Everybody Loves Raymond"". The neighbors are as darkly freaky as the rest of the Barone family with Hanks a definite variation of Ray Romano and Carrie Fisher as uptight and irascible as Debra Barone. Add in such odd characters as Gale Gordan's grumpy old man, chronically high teen Corey Feldman and Bruce Dern's redneck. This is suburban hell, and there appears to be no escape.When Hanks, Dern and another neighbor snoop on the newcomers, they spot someone who looks like Eddie Munster and Lurch's love child with what appears to be a body bag, they suspect foul play. Then, grumpy Gordan disappears, furthering the mystery. The three men begin to get spooked out, and from there, things just weirder and weirder, starting with a dream sequence that make Tevye's nightmare seem like having tea with Mr. Rogers. With neighbors like this (which includes ""Laugh-In"" actor Henry Gibson as a rather strange doctor), who needs cul de sacs?I've had my share of strange or annoying neighbors over the years, but at least I could find things to laugh about. I found minimalistic things to laugh at here, and the whole black comedy theme is truly overdone. Perhaps on paper, the script seemed funnier, or overtime it has just been weighed down in bad taste. The late 1980's and early 90's had a slew of strange neighbor comedies with suburban themes, and a good majority of them are truly bad. But this one is even worse, because it seems to pride itself on thinking that it is much funnier than it is, and in retrospect that smugness is what kills it.",The 'Burbs
4,gavin6942,"Enjoyable Joe Dante, Though Not His Top Work",6,8 April 2012,"An over-stressed suburbanite (Tom Hanks) and his paramilitaric neighbor (Bruce Dern) struggle to prove their paranoid theory that the new family in town is a front for a cannibalistic cult.Joe Dante is a strange director. He graduated from the Roger Corman School of Film, and quickly made a name for himself with ""Piranha"" and ""The Howling"". Even non-horror fans saw his work in ""Gremlins"". Dante was a master of horror... with a comedic edge. And that is where this film comes in. Really much more of a dark comedy than horror, we have Tom Hanks, Corey Feldman and Bruce Dern (with a special cameo appearance from Corman graduate and Dante regular Dick Miller!)...Is this Dante's best work? No, not at all. After ""Gremlins"", it is hard to top that... though, he has made some good things since (""Gremlins 2"" and ""Matinee"" come to mind, and even ""Screwfly Solution"" was pretty decent). But this is probably not the worst of his work -- it is very fun, very enjoyable and silly in a way that makes it a good film for both kids or adults (or adults with children inside them).Roger Ebert says, ""It's hard to put your finger on exactly what's missing from the movie."" And that is somewhat right. He ranks it much lower than I do, but it is very much true that it seems that the film is so close to greatness, but almost fails. What is missing? I do not know... but I do know it is not Carrie Fisher, who is not used to full effect, but may help court the geek viewer.Whatever is missing, it is better to enjoy a half-baked Joe Dante film than a fully-baked film fro ma lesser director. Where else will you find Tom Hanks interacting with such a motley crew, digging up the yard looking for human remains?",The 'Burbs
5,lee_eisenberg,Go figure!,7,12 May 2006,"It seems that ""The 'burbs"" has usually been regarded with scorn, but I actually found it to be worth seeing. Portraying a suburban neighborhood where the something seems a little strange about the new neighbors, director Joe Dante really knows how to build everything up. Tom Hanks stars in his usual everyman role, this time as the man convinced that the neighbors are up to something.All in all, I would agree with a previous reviewer that this would be a neat movie to experience (as are all of Joe Dante's movies). Weird? Deliberately so. Will you trust your neighbors after watching this? That's up to you. But mark my words, this is a cool flick. Also starring Carrie Fisher, Bruce Dern, Gale Gordon, Henry Gibson, Courtney Gains, Corey Feldman, and of course, appearances by Dick Miller and Robert Picardo.",The 'Burbs
6,jboothmillard,The 'Burbs,6,30 November 2011,"From director Joe Dante (The Howling, Gremlins, Small Soldiers), I had maybe tried the first few minutes of this film twice, but I guess I didn't really get into or understand the concept, but I did finally watch it in full. Basically at Mayfield Place, Hinkley Hills, Missouri lives Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks), and his neighbours, Vietnam veteran Lt. Mark Rumsfield (Bruce Dern), teenager Ricky Butler (Corey Feldman) and often paranoid Art Weingartner (Scary Movie's Rick Ducommun) all have their questions about a house on the block. The family known as The Klopeks have lived in the mysterious, dreary looking old house across the way for a little while, but nobody has been seen any come in or go out of the house, and no-one knows what is going on inside with family members, there are suspicions with all the strange noises. Ray is on a long home vacation, and with his free time he decides with his neighbours that they should try and communicate with and bring out the strange family to answer their questions. It turns out it not just the house that is peculiar, but also the family themselves, with weird Dr. Werner Klopek (Henry Gibson), hick looking Hans (Courtney Gains) and elderly oddball Reuben (Brother Theodore), they even get to go in the house that is reasonably alright, but there is obviously awkwardness trying to get to know them. Eventually, with all the bizarre goings on, to the protest of their loved one, including Peterson's wife Carol (Carrie Fisher), Ray, Mark and Art decide that they should break into the Klopek compound and investigate all over, especially the basement, and find incriminating evidence of foul play, e.g. bodies or bones. In the end it at first looks like they had the neighbours all wrong, and that the big disaster is their high paranoia taking over and making them the weirdos, but actually Dr. Klopek was apparently murdering, as they find skulls in his car trunk, so it turns out alright for Ray and the good guys in the end. Also starring Wendy Schaal as Bonnie Rumsfield, Dick Miller as Vic the Garbageman, Star Trek: Voyager's Robert Picardo as Joe the Garbageman, Gale Gordon as Walter Seznick, Bridesmaids' Franklyn Ajaye as Detective #1 and Mars Attack's Rance Howard, Ron and Clint's father as Detective #2. Hanks is fantastic with his overacting being mad and complaining, Ducommun is likable as the slightly moronic and theorising friend, and the other cast members are okay as well, it is essentially a conspiracy kind of thing played out like a humorous mystery with slapstick and weirdness thrown in, all in all not a bad comedy. Good!",The 'Burbs
7,ccthemovieman-1,Ducommun Delivers In One Of My All-Time Favorites,10,6 March 2006,"Sometimes a bizarre comedy just hits the right notes with me and, despite none of my friends liking it, I love it. This is a premier example of such: one of my favorites in that category. The fact others don't share that opinion doesn't bother me, but I am glad to see reviewers on this site who appreciated this black, very underrated gem.I always get a big kick out of this film, no matter how many times I see it.I credit a little-known actor for making this so entertaining to me: Rick Ducommun. I think he steals the show from well-known stars Tom Hanks, Bruce Dern, Carrie Fisher and Corey Feldman. Actually, I think this film is panned a lot because they didn't expect Hanks to be in something this goofy. Too bad, but I bet he had a lot fun making it, along with the rest of the cast.Ducommun and Dern are the hilarious wackos who try to help straight-laced Hanks find out about the really-strange neighbors he has next door. Are these people some demented killers or just the figment of these nosy neighbors' imagination? Fisher is Hanks' always-complaining wife and Feldman is the teen across the street who watches all the lunacy from his porch, getting his getting nightly entertainment from these crazy adults.Director Joe Dante, of ""Gremlins"" fame, does a good job entertaining us in here, too, and providing some fun camera-work. Dante also used music to great advantage, mostly for humor.This is one of those ""not for all tastes"" films, so chances are you won't like it and think it's stupid. For a number of reasons, I love it.",The 'Burbs
8,BA_Harrison,In a neighbourhood like this you know it's hard to survive...,5,7 September 2012,"Even though it displays many of director Joe Dante's recognisable trademarks-dark humour, quirky characters, cartoonish violence, Dick Miller (all of which usually guarantee me a good time)-I still struggle with The 'Burbs. Quite simply, it's protagonists, a trio of paranoid suburbanites, aren't all that likable: their pointless lives consist of petty squabbles with family and neighbours, and when a strange family from Eastern Europe moves into their neighbourhood, the persecution of outsiders.Despite very little evidence to support their feelings of distrust, Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks), Mark Rumsfield (Bruce Dern) and Art Weingartner (Rick Ducommun) launch a campaign of intimidation, based purely on the fact that their neighbours are different. Of course, Dante vindicates his characters' behaviour at the end of the film by revealing that Ray and pals were right all along-the people next door ARE psycho killers after all-but the underlying message is that foreigners are evil and cannot be trusted.",The 'Burbs
9,moonspinner55,"Playful enough dark comedy, but one with a minimum of jokes...",5,19 May 2010,"After suspicious new residents move into the creepy old house on the block, neighbors next door and across the street come to believe they are Satanists. Unsubtle, poorly-directed black farce, though one with a game troupe of players and a handful of amusing scenes. The suburban world depicted here looks so artificial that the movie never transports us, never takes us off the studio backlot, while screenwriter Dana Olsen fails to fill the movie's running time with enough jokes to sustain the premise. Tom Hanks is given too much slack from director Joe Dante, who allows the star to go overboard with brash outbursts; however, the rest of the cast pulls together nicely to create a colorful, amiable small town community, and the finish is satisfying. ** from ****",The 'Burbs
10,paul_haakonsen,An enjoyable friendly neighborhood movie...,6,15 August 2017,"""The 'Burbs"" is a movie that I have watched a couple of times over the years since 1989, probably about 4 times or so since then. It is the type of movie that never really gets old, and it does have that classic value to it, so it doesn't lose its entertainment value.The storyline is about a quiet and idyllic neighborhood that is turned upside down when the mysterious Klopek family moves into the neighborhood. Strange happenings and the curiosity of the neighbors soon have Ray Peterson (played by Tom Hanks), Mark Rumsfield (played by Bruce Dern) and Art Weingartner (played by Rick Ducommun) cross the line and start snooping into the Klopek's business and trespass unto their property.Writer Dana Olsen put together a very entertaining story that contains elements of mystery and comedy, and mix them together quite well. And the character gallery in the movie was quite interesting, and the characters really added so much flavor to the movie. And director Joe Dante did a great job in bringing the movie to life on the screen.Now, one of the more impressive things about ""The 'Burbs"" is the ensemble of talents that they rounded up for this movie. The lead roles are played by Tom Hanks, Bruce Dern and Rick Ducommun, whom all carried the movie quite nicely. But there is an equally impressive support cast which includes names such as Carrie Fisher, Corey Feldman and Henry Gibson.There is a lot of funny situations throughout the movie, and I always find myself well amused and laughing throughout the course of ""The 'Burbs"".If you haven't already seen ""The 'Burbs"" then I can warmly and strongly recommend that you take the time to do so, because this is a classic in its own.",The 'Burbs
11,Quinoa1984,The *other* (superior) 80s Tom Hanks movie involving a house and tomfoolery,8,23 June 2019,"The *other* 1989 movie where the main character staggers all covered in ash near the end and... Yeah that just rocks (and here something *does* blow up, kids!)At first, I wasn't sure completely about this movie. By this I mean, I was admiring it for the first few 5-10 minutes, but I also thought ""hmm, maybe Dante is laying on his manic/giant cartoon dollies and zoom and BIG choices style a tad thick here - even complete with a somewhat unnecessary Leone homage."" But then two things happened: first, the story really got cooking, with the constant paranoia and the Hammer horror aesthetic. And secondly, it clicked why this works: these guys, Hanks and Dern and (looks at notes) Ducommon are man-children (or really 7 year olds in grown ups bodies) with Carrie Fisher as the one grown-up - aka, Mom - and it's all just madness.And yes, even with the climax and where this leads to (oh Henry Gibson, the best. Just ::chefs kiss::), it doesn't diminish how absolutely nuts these suburbanites are. Every step of the way, the film is not showing these dudes in a light where we're made to fully get on their side (well, Hanks can do that in his sleep, and he helps add a human dimension where the others are playing to type, even Dern), and that's the only way this can work in its core. The rest of the madcap and horror is like icing on the cake.And really, we all are nuts, is what I want to add. I don't know if it will be on everyones comedic wavelength (my wife as a night time cuddle buddy was meh on it, and I wasn't going to judge her for that, different strokes is all), and I think I just found so many awkward beats totally uproariously funny (every second where Fisher Hanks and Dern go to the house midway through to meet the neighbors is gold, leering facial expressions from the ICONIC Brother Theodore included). Dante's aesthetic takes a few minutes to take off, but once it does, it's like digging into a bowl of candy... But it's got a real KICK to it.Plus, Dick Miller, naturally. And I do like what Carrie Fisher does with her hair!",The 'Burbs
12,BandSAboutMovies,Purely great!,10,19 February 2019,"Screenwriter Dana Olsen wrote a script called Life in the 'Burbs that he based on his own childhood. Growing up, he learned that what seemed like a normal life from the outside revealed a world of psychotic people. He said, ""As a kid, it was fascinating to think that Mr. Flanagan down the street could turn out to be Jack the Ripper. And where there's fear, there's comedy. So I approached The 'Burbs as Ozzie and Harriet Meet Charles Manson.""Once the film entered the hands of Joe Dante - who we've often written about as someone who deftly skews the American middle-class while planting his feet firmly within it - it got even crazier. He placed the entire film on the Universal Studios backlot and brought it stories he heard all the time of that one house in every neighborhood where you never see people leave, you see the lights on all night long and the grass never gets cut. It's kind of like that Tom Waits tune - ""What's He Building?""""What's he building in there?What the hell is he building in there?He has subscriptions to those magazines.He never waves when he goes by.He's hiding something from the rest of us.""Mayfield Place is one of many identical neighborhoods inside Hinkley Hills, which is one of many identical neighborhoods in Iowa, which is one of so many identical states across the country. It's also the name of the neighborhood from TV's Leave It to Beaver, which was also shot on the same lot.Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks) has a week vacation, which is just enough time to learn that his new neighbor's, the Klopeks, are at the best strange and at the worst a danger to every house on the block.After all, that's what Art Weingartner (Rick Ducommun, Snik from Little Monsters) thinks. And so does military vet Lt. Mark Rumsfield (Bruce Dern!) who watch Hans Klopek (Courtney Gains, Malachai from Children of the Corn) use the family's car to drive garbage a few feet to the curb. And that's not all. Soon, the entire family is digging up their backyard with pick-axes in the middle of a torrential rainstorm.Mark's wife Bonnie (Dante favorite Wendy Schaal) finds another neighbor, the elderly Walter (Gale Gordon, long the TV sitcom enemy of Lucille Ball and you can see photos of the two of them together all over his house), missing and his dog running loose. All that's left? His toupee.Ray's wife Carol (Carrie Fisher!) tires of this silliness and invites everyone over to the Klopeks. While everyone else meets Dr. Werner (Henry Gibson!) and Uncle Reuben (Brother Theodore!), Ray sneaks to the basement where he finds Walter's toupee.Hijinks ensue, as they must in any great movie. This is a film that you can come in on at any point and find something magical and hilarious. Are the Klopeks really killers? Has the entire neighborhood gone insane? Will Ray blow up their house? Just watch it!Here's some trivia that I love about this movie:The structure used as the Peterson home was also used as the home of the character of the virgin Connie Swail in the Tom Hanks film Dragnet.While they were editing the movie, Dante used Ennio Morricone's ""Se Sei Qualcuno è Colpa Mia"" from My Name Is Nobody as the temporary track for the scene where Ray and Art walk up to the Klopeks' house and ended up falling in love with it. It's in the film instead of the Jerry Goldsmith score.Walter's toy poodle Queenie? That's the same dog that played Precious in The Silence of the Lambs.Corey Feldman and Michael Jackson were close friends during the filming and Bubbles the Chimp was a frequent set guest. Unfortunately, the celebrity monkey regularly defecated all over the place, so Dante had to ban him from the set. Yet dog poop was needed throughout the movie, so prop master Mark Jameson made an actor safe version from canned dog food and bean dip that he loaded into caulking guns.The Klopeks house is filled with TV and movie references. One of the paintings is from Night Gallery. Their dog Landru is named for an alien overlord from Star Trek (or a French serial killer). The sled Rosebud from Citizen Kane is in their basement. But ironically, it isn't their house that was from The Munsters. Feldman's character Ricky Butler's family lives there.At one point, Ray studies a book called The Theory and Practice of Demonology. That book isn't real. How do I know? Its author is Julian Karswell, the bad guy from The Curse of the Demon.Much like every Joe Dante movie, Dick Miller shows up. Here, he's Vic the garbage man.Finally - on the subject of Brother Theodore - I first discovered him as a kid when he was a frequent guest on David Letterman's early shows. These blasts of strangeness still amaze me. I'm shocked that they ever aired on a major network they're so odd. And if you're wondering where you've heard Theodore before, perhaps it's in the trailer for Fulci's The House by the Cemetery.",The 'Burbs
13,Coventry,Something's Rotten in Suburbia!,6,25 October 2007,"According to this wondrous website, ""The Burbs"" is a horror film as well as a comedy. I concur up until a certain point (otherwise I wouldn't even have written the comment), but surely it's predominantly a comedy effort; in particular a pitch-black comedy and a satire of the most quintessential type. It may not be obvious at first, but ""The Burbs"" is actually very reminiscent to Tim Burton's ""Edward Scissorhands"" (or vice versa, since the latter came after), as both films cleverly and not-so-subtly parody the typical ambiance & lifestyles within American suburbs. Both films excessively juxtapose the sickly jealous, overly noisy and fake-friendly suburbanites against the supposedly outcast new arrivals, and rapidly come to the conclusion that they are at least equally weird, if not weirder. Ray Peterson, a typical neighborhood fanatic with a week of holiday to relax and work in the garden, quickly joins his extremely paranoid neighbors with spying on the new Klopek family. Admittedly the Klopeks act a little weird, like dig up the garden at night and beat up the garbage cans, but Ray and especially his friends (a tactics-obsessed war veteran and a chubby guy obsessed with murder stories) are pretty deranged themselves. ""The Burbs"" thrives on over-the-top comical situations, far-fetched misunderstandings and delightfully grotesque acting performances. The pacing is quite energetic and doesn't allow you to contemplate too much about the exaggeratedly stupid concept. The horror elements of the film are obviously very soft, still the sequences inside the macabre house of the Klopeks are quite atmospheric and the set-pieces (all the stuff in their basement) are effectively sinister. Deep down in his heart, Joe Dante primarily remains a horror-director, so his fans also this means that ""The Burbs"" is literally stuffed with slick references/tributes towards classic genre films and real-life terror. The giant family dog is even named Landru, after the infamous French serial killer! Nowadays Tom Hanks is a highly respected actor and frequent winner of prominent awards, but personally I'll always prefer his joyful 80's comedies. Hanks is truly terrific in this role here and he's got a superb supportive cast to back him up, including familiar names like Bruce Dern, Rick Ducommun, Carrie Fisher , Henry Gibson, Cory Feldman, Courtney Gains (the creep from ""Children of the Corn"") and Dick Miller. ""The Burbs"" is by no means classic cinema, but an irresistible and charming piece of entertainment nonetheless.",The 'Burbs

Hey somebody start a thread on the boards and we`ll swap tales of terror Yeah , many of us have suffered in this way and hopefully with THE `BURBS the audience will be able to relate to the premise. Unfortunately we cant , not really because there`s a slight problem with Dana Olsen`s script . It`s maybe just a little too slapstick and not serious enough to be persausive enough to be true therefore the movie doesn`t really work as either black comedy or satire and I can`t help feeling this movie might have started along the lines of STATIC another film poking barbed fun at American surburbia  Strangely director Joe Dante both increases and decreases the movie`s intelligence . He plays up to the movie`s slapstick element , a good example being the oft shown clip where a bone is found and the camera pans in and out of the characters screaming faces , but he also refers to other movies like having music culled from PATTON  and HELLRAISER and having Bruce Dern playing the stereotypical ex- Vietnam vet which does improve the enjoyment of a film that would have probably have been very forgettable otherwise",The 'Burbs
17,Hey_Sweden,Satan is good. Satan is our pal.,7,27 March 2017,"""The 'Burbs"" is writer / co-producer / actor Dana Olsens' deliberately warped invention. The idea is to remove the picture perfect outer layer of average American suburban life and reveal what potential insanity could be bubbling underneath. In so doing, he also makes fun of suburbanites who seem to make it their business to know everybody elses' business.Tom Hanks stars as Ray Peterson, your typical 'burb dweller, who ends up severely stressed out when his nutty neighbors - Bruce Dern as ex-military man Mark Rumsfield and the late comedian Rick Ducommun as nosey instigator Art Weingartner - spur him to action. They keep hearing weird noises, and seeing weird things, concerning the newcomers to the street, the Klopeks (Henry Gibson, Brother Theodore, Courtney Gains), and wonder just what the hell is going on inside the Klopek house. To make matters more interesting, their elderly neighbor Walter Seznick (Gale Gordon) goes missing. Could the Klopeks be responsible for his disappearance?Ray tries his best to be rational and skeptical, but finds himself drawn in more and more by his kooky comrades and the things he witnesses. Acting as a genuine voice of reason is his understandably frustrated wife Carol (Carrie Fisher).The whole thing becomes rather over the top, but then a sense of anarchy to his stories has always been filmmaker Joe Dantes' (""Piranha"" '78, ""The Howling"", ""Gremlins"") strong suit. Olsen and Dante have fun with the dark comedy aspect to this yarn, and there are some quite funny bits along the way. Viewing the whole circus from the sidelines is neighborhood teen Ricky Butler (Corey Feldman), who tries to convince his peers that the goings on here are better than any movie they could watch. Among those who really get into the spirit of the material are production designer James Spencer and composer Jerry Goldsmith.Hanks is terrific, and much like the legendary Gene Wilder, proves to be a master at freaking out in a comedic way. But the whole cast is great, with Ducommun often going to town on the scenery. The cast is filled with familiar faces: Wendy Schaal, Dick Miller (Dantes' good luck charm for many years), Robert Picardo, Franklyn Ajaye, Rance Howard, Nicky Katt, Kevin Gage, Patrika Darbo. Olsen himself appears as a cop.While the story is ultimately rather predictable, it does keep you watching, and amused - and may make you wonder what goes on behind your own neighbors' doors.Seven out of 10.",The 'Burbs
18,preppy-3,Pretty bad,4,3 April 2002,"Tom Hanks is now considered a great actor. After the huge successes of ""Philadelphia"" (1993) and ""Forrest Gump"" (1994) (along with two Academy Awards), every film he's in is a hit. But, back in the 1980s, he made a string of pretty bad comedies (""Splash"" and ""Big"" are exceptions and I have a soft spot for ""Bachelor Party""). But does anyone remember ""Volunteers""? ""The Man With One Red Shoe""? And the one we're talking about now?It's pretty mediocre. A strange family moves into a picture perfect neighborhood in suburbia and people come to believe they're murderers. Basically this is a satire on suburban living but it doesn't say anything new or different about it. The cast is great, it has beautiful production designs and a fantastic score that is very clever---but it has a bad script.The jokes are there but they aren't funny--after a while it becomes a chore to watch this movie. I was dozing off during the last half!The only thing that keeps this watchable is the good acting by the cast--especially Tom Hanks (who is always good), Carrie Fisher, Henry Gibson and Bruce Dern. Also it's the late Gale Gordon's last movie. It's always great to see him and he was always funny, but he looks terrible here. Sadly he was suffering from cancer. So, this isn't unbearable just not very good.A few lines do work, but it's not worth seeing. Go rent ""Splash"" or ""Big"" instead. One of the few bombs director Joe Dante has done.",The 'Burbs

Fantastically entertaining black comedy that's a personal favourite of mine...",8,4 June 2005,"The 'Burbs starts with a cool manipulation of the Universal logo, the word universal disappears & the camera zooms in from outer space on the trademark globe eventually coming to rest on a cul-de-sac named Mayfield Place situated in the American town of Hickley Hills.

No one in the street knows anything about the Klopek's, not even how many of them there are. The Klopek's are strange neighbour's, they've never introduced themselves, they don't take care of the house, the garden is full of weeds & dead trees, bizarre lights & noises emanate from their basement, they dig holes in their back-garden at night during rainstorms, Ray's dog Vince digs up what looks like a human thigh bone from their back-garden & they even manage to act suspiciously merely taking out the rubbish. While on vacation for the entire week Ray's friends Art Weingartner (Rick Ducommun) & Mark Rumsfield (Bruce Dern) being to fill Ray's head with story's which almost overnight seem all too plausible as Walter Seznick (Gale Gordon) an elderly resident suddenly disappears without trace, the loony trio suspect the Klopek's of everything from murder to satanism. Seeing what's going on Ray's & Marks wives Carrol & Bonnie (Wendy Schaal) decide to put an end to the spying & speculation by going round to the Klopek's & introducing themselves to their strange neighbour's, but things don't go as the ladies had planned as Ray & Mark leave even more convinced of the Klopek's guilt, they just need to find out guilty of what exactly...Directed by Joe Dante I love The 'Burbs, I've seen it quite a few times & never tire of it. Dante manages to keep things moving & really pile on the paranoia as the film progresses without giving too much away & he creates some great scenes which contain both comedy & tension. The well thought-out script by Dana Olsen is almost perfect, it's interesting & entertaining, it feels refreshingly different, it moves along at a great pace & is never boring or dull. I love the idea of Hanks being the normal sceptical guy who manages to twist ordinary situations into something sinister as his idiot friends put crazy ideas into his head. The use of paranoia is excellent throughout as we find out what's going on as Hanks does, by the time The 'Burbs finished I was thinking up lots of crazy solutions & scenario's as well! All the characters are fun & likable which helps immensely to just become lost in their crazy world. I also thought The 'Burbs was an incredibly funny film throughout, the dialogue is littered with some absolutely terrific one-liners & is just entertaining to listen too. I love the scene when they introduce themselves to the Klopek's for the first time, the way they all just sit in a really awkward silence as Reuben (Brother Theodore) stares menacingly at Hanks, Hanks eventually breaking the silence by talking about drainage. Or when Hans (Courtney Gains) offers him a raw sardine which Carrol makes him eat. There are many, many more examples of great individual scenes & sequences throughout The 'Burbs which had me quite literary laughing out loud & it's not often a film makes me do that these day's. There is a definite dark streak running through The 'Burbs, it has some cool creepy horror elements & tries to make us think about who the strange one's really are, the people who don't conform to a certain way of living & society in general or the people who persecute them because of it. I just love the way The 'Burbs is constructed & how it all builds up to a slightly over-the-top & somewhat silly ending which is the weakest part of The 'Burbs but still works & is a satisfying enough way to round the film off I suppose. There is no real gore in The 'Burbs but there is are brief sequences from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986) & The Exorcist (1973) as Hanks imagination is fuelled even more by late night horror films on T.V. which we catch a few shots of, there are a few human skulls as well. There's a fair bit of swearing & language too so I'm not sure it's suitable for all the family. The acting is great from everyone, Hanks is brilliant as the hero & really likable as the ordinary man living a boring life in suburbia who lets his imagination run riot, Cory Feldman makes an appearance as Ricky Butler one of the neighbour's & surprisingly even he is good in it, a great cast for a great film. On the negative side The 'Burbs is a little bit silly at times & one or two of the characters were a bit annoying on occasion, but these are small quibbles generally speaking considering The 'Burbs is just such good, funny entertainment. Technically The 'Burbs is strong with a great atmospheric Church organ sounding main theme by Jerry Goldsmith, good photography, editing, special effects & production values. Overall I love The 'Burbs, it's fantastic fun that I never seem to tire of. Highly recommended as something a bit different, quite thought provoking at times with a great speech by Hanks at the end & all that's left for me to say is watch it as soon as you can!",The 'Burbs
20,Bunuel1976,"THE 'BURBS (Joe Dante, 1989) ***",7,10 November 2008,"I'd always heard good things about this suburban comedy with a touch of the macabre about it; director Dante (whom I saw numerous times at the 2004 Venice Film Festival) was adept on both fronts  since he usually dabbled in horror stuff done with a sense of humor.Anyway, the simple plot involves a trio of typical American families living on the same street who become curious about their newly-arrived neighbors  the latter not only live in a dilapidated house but hardly ever emerge outdoors, though light can be seen coming from their basement at night! This was still fairly early in lead Tom Hanks' career, so his comic/nervous traits rather than the thoughtfulness of his later performances are at the fore here. He mainly comes off as amiable, and is nicely supported by Carrie Fisher as his wife and, playing the neighbors, military-minded patriot Bruce Dern (to this end, composer Jerry Goldsmith knowingly incorporates cues here from his classic score for PATTON [1970]!) and overbearing goofball Rick Ducommun.The various situations which see the three men attempting to determine what goes on at the mysterious house next door  especially after yet another neighbor (whose dog everybody hates) goes missing  are both inspired and funny. Best of all perhaps is Hanks' nightmare, brought on by an occult tome penned by one Julian Karswell (Dante's films always involve some cinematic in-joke, in this case referencing Niall MacGinnis' formidable villain in Jacques Tourneur's NIGHT OF THE DEMON [1957]), which has him being barbecued during a satanic rite! Others have physically painful repercussions on his associates: Ducommun is electrocuted while trespassing onto the eccentric neighbors' property, whereas Dern (distracted by teen Corey Feldman and the pals he brings over just for the occasion) falls off the roof  with rifle in hand firing away!  during one of his strategic maneuvers. Equally hilarious, however, is a scene highlighting Dante regulars Dick Miller and Robert Picardo as garbage collectors  having seen the neighbors' hirsute kid put out the trash the night before, Ducommun and Dern think the bags may hold the dismembered body of the missing person, so they climb into the garbage depository of the van and proceed to throw everything back onto the pavement! When they finally get to meet the Klopeks (including obligatory mad scientist Henry Gibson and the sinister-looking Brother[!] Theodor as, well, his elder sibling), of course, the latter come off as daffy but essentially harmless. Even so, our heroes aren't satisfied (Hanks' dog digs up what looks like a human thigh-bone from the garden next door) and, when the neighbors make an infrequent trip out of town, Hanks and Ducommun take the opportunity to search the house  but only manage to hit a gas pipe and blow up the house! At this, Hanks has had enough and, though bandaged up, physically assaults Ducommun  this scene, in which Hanks denounces suburbia as both prejudiced and paranoid, suggests that the film may have had a serious intent after all; that said, it ends by proving Ducommun right  as the Klopeks, who arrive on the scene just then, reveal themselves for the monsters they truly are! At the end of the day, this surely emerges as one of Dante (and Hanks') most satisfying efforts; for the record, apart from adding the same director's INNERSPACE (1987) to my collection (after having also recently acquired the two beloved GREMLINS movies), I'll be following it with his EXPLORERS (1985) and HOMECOMING (2005), the latter being the first of two entries Dante helmed for the ""Masters Of Horror"" TV series",The 'Burbs

There are terabytes of Ring video to watch of package thieves, crapping trespassing dogs, and careless postal workers. If that's not exciting then I don't know what is.Well, ""The 'Burbs"" was a little more than that, but that is how it started. Until the Klopeks moved into the quaint suburban cul de sac on Mayfield Place the most exciting action was Rumsfield (Bruce Dern) going after his neighbor, Walter (Gale Gordon), for allowing his dog to defecate onto his lawn. The Klopeks, though, were mysterious and eerie. They never came outside and there were always strange noises coming from their house.Ray (Tom Hanks), Rumsfield, and Art (Rick Ducommun) decided they were going to finally investigate. Would they find dead bodies or would they find that the Klopeks are just eccentric foreigners with different proclivities than their ""normal"" neighbors?""The 'Burbs"" is really a warning to any and all foreigners: don't move into our neighborhood. If you're different then we'll distrust you, harass you, and eventually blow up your house. The message was very clear to me. I know that they were ostensibly hinting at the fact that the 'burbs will make you go crazy with its uniformity and monotonous routines, but just beneath the more apparent message was the message of: ""Keep Out!""",The 'Burbs
22,FlashCallahan,Pretzel and sardine perhaps?....,4,2 October 2014,"Ray Peterson takes a week off from work just to walk around in pyjamas all day, read the newspaper and lay low. However, Ray has some very peculiar neighbours. In fact he has no normal neighbours, but one neighbour in particular is especially strange. Ray and the other neighbours decide to investigate what's wrong with the Klopeks, and the relaxing week off from work becomes something far from that...I must have missed the boat with this one. It came out in 1989, a brilliant year for cinema, and this was quite a prolific release for that year. But it just passed me by.25 years later and it lands on my lap, I give it a chance, and let's say, I won't be bothered if its another 25 years until I see it again.I love Dante, he made some of the most innovative films of the eighties, and the story is good, and it does hit home. We all have mysterious neighbours who appear a little alien to us, even a little weird.And the less we know, the more we spy, pry, and gossip, making our own assumptions delusionally true, this could have really been something, but it plays it way too kooky for its own good.If this was a straight up thriller, it would have worked, but the comedy just seems too forced, and it's trying to be over the top dark.Hanks looks bored throughout, and the scene where they think they have Walters bone and the camera pans in and out quickly while they scream, Hanks has never looked so embarrassed in his life.It tries to reference too many old movies, but it doesn't work.Which is a shame, because the idea is wonderful.",The 'Burbs
23,Aaron1375,The burb's is a rarity...a black comedy I enjoyed.,7,9 July 2009,"I generally do not like the movie format and category of the black comedy. Usually, they become so dark that they cease to be funny or entertaining to me...a good example of this is ""War of the Roses"". There have been some that I enjoyed though and this is one of them. I usually like the ones that only really edge towards the dark side a bit and I would say this one does that. It kind of goes into horror at times, but still remains funny unlike another black horror/comedy ""Parents"" with Randy Quaid. This film features a new family moving into a very old and not so attractive house. These newcomers are under immediate scrutiny and suspicion as they move in the middle of the night, do not do anything to really fix up the place, and are generally strange looking when some of the people in the neighborhood pay them a visit. Tom Hanks character is not really suspicious at first till his crazy neighbor and a paranoid one convince there is something up with the new family in the burbs. You get many funny scenes as these guys try to find proof that the new family is as strange as they look and are in fact up to something as the poodle a man who lives in the neighborhood shows up dirty and the neighbor ends up missing. The movie plays out rather good and is funny for the most part, at times it becomes a bit to dark as most black comedies tend to do. The cast is very funny and I think this is like the only movie I have seen Carrie Fisher in besides the Star Wars trilogy. Bruce Dern to me steals the show in terms of comedy followed by the neighbor who deduces the bone is human. Not sure of his name or any other movies he has done prior to or since this one. Even Corey Feldman does a rather good job. So all in all this is a nice trip to the burbs.",The 'Burbs
24,zetes,Misses its own point,5,20 September 2009,"The residents of a cul-de-sac grow suspicious of their new neighbors in this '80s comedy. Tom Hanks, Bruce Dern and Rick Ducommun lead the charge against the mysterious, foreign-sounding people (Henry Gibson, Brother Theodore and Courtney Gains). There's a good satire at the heart of it, about xenophobia and general mistrust of so-called regular people, but Dante misses it for the most part. The neighbors are, in fact, a freakshow. He way overdoes this aspect. Their yard and home is so unkempt (they've only lived there a month, yet all their grass and trees are dead), I would imagine the police would have at least given them a citation by this point. When we actually meet the people, they all seem to be out of 1930s horror movies. The rest of the cast overacts terribly, too. Hanks may have been very popular in comedies at the time, but he really was a pretty poor comic actor. Ducommun is particularly annoying (yeah, he's supposed to be, but he shouldn't make me want to turn the movie off). Dern was the only one who was kind of funny, but he plays too much of a nutjob to be one of the ""heroes"" of the picture. Most of the movie is actually pretty watchable, if unremarkable, but the final act is not only anticlimactic, but retracts the well-observed moral of the story.",The 'Burbs

The Burbs is a satisfactory film about neighbors, suspicion, and the perils of suburban life. When the strange new neighbors move in next door, Tom Hanks and his neighbor friends like Bruce Dern and Corey Feldman start searching for answers. This was a Tom Hanks vehicle long before his Oscar winning roles in Philadelphia and Forrest Gump. Now that he is the king of Hollywood films, movies like this won't happen anymore. Tom Hanks' role as a suburban father is actually quite typically having fun. Soon, you wonder if he misses these roles rather than Oscar depth roles of today.

26,deloudelouvain,It has it's moments but in the end it's just okay,6,14 May 2016,For the eighties The Burbs was probably a good movie. It's still okay now but there are just much better movies then this one so that's why I only give it a six. I probably would have scored it higher when it came out. It has a couple of funny moments but overall it's not good enough to compete with the classic comedies. As for the mystery I have to agree that you will try to figure out what is going on in that house. So for that it got my attention. A thriller I would certainly not call it because it just isn't. If you like the early Tom Hanks then you will probably like The Burbs as well. To me it's just a good enough movie to watch on a Saturday afternoon but not that of a big deal.,The 'Burbs
27,SimonJack,When you don't meet your new neighbors,7,5 September 2017,"""The 'Burbs"" is a very funny movie. It's not loaded with witty dialog, but it has one funny situation after another. The men who live on their street wonder about the folks who have moved into the unkempt house in the neighborhood. It resembles a haunted house, and they have seen and heard strange things going on there at night. Tom Hanks plays Ray Peterson who's starting a week's vacation. Wife Carol (Carrie Fisher) wants him to go to their rustic lake cabin to relax. But his interest in the unseen neighbors who moved in three months before has him all keyed up. Neighbors Art Weingartner (Rick Ducommun) and Mark Rumsfield (Bruce Dern) convince Ray that there's something strange going on. These three go through a series of falls, slips and jolts as they try to uncover and maybe expose the unseen folks. The mayhem that results is hilarious. All of the cast are very good.

For some reason I had confused this with Arlington Road. That film (also firmly set in suburbia) starts with seeming unfounded claims of sinister goings on and the viewers' standing is constantly undermined. Here things are so much more straightforward and despite some marvellous and amusing cinematic cleverness and inverted cliches, this is essentially a slapstick and rather broad popcorn jape. It has not worn well, as in my opinion is the case with many late 80s films, and it is hard to fully appreciate 30 years on. I always find the acting style of Carrie Fisher and Tom Hanks rather embarrassing and only Bruce Dern and Henry Gibson, for me, do the job required. They both remain solidly in character, throughout the madness and I rather feel that if director Dante had so instructed the rest of the cast this might have been easier to enjoy.",The 'Burbs

31,MovieAddict2016,Flawed but addictive.,8,13 April 2004,"The opening credits of ""The 'burbs"" give us the impression of a film that could turn out to be extremely witty. It's about a small suburban neighborhood in Middle-America comprised of a bizarre array of really wacky people. Tom Hanks plays the main character, an amiable guy who has taken a week off of work, and is now just sitting around the house all day in his PJs, suspecting that his new next-door neighbors are hiding something. Another one of his neighbors, a paramilitary nut with no war to fight (Bruce Dern), decides to investigate a little - and they soon believe that the family is a pack of murderers.As the film progresses onwards it becomes a bit dumb, especially towards the very end, which was allegedly re-filmed after test audiences did not like the original climax. Maybe they should have kept their mouths shut.The pack of apparent murderers is led by Academy-Award nominee Henry Gibson, who is one of those great underrated characters actors, and who always manages to creep out the audience without having to say anything at all. The movie leads us to believe that he is a murderer. What's awful about the end is the ""twist"" - or how sloppily it is presented. I would have bought it; I would have been surprised by it, if it didn't seem so forced and unbelievable. I started wondering whether the whole ending was a dream sequence. Much to my disappointment, it was not. But just now I thought of a way that the film might have ended that would have sustained its dignity and actually shocked people instead of embarrassing them with its ineptness.I will not lie: ""The 'burbs"" is pretty mediocre, and I can understand why many people might dislike it. Yet as with many comedies from the '80s, it carries a sort of charm and is almost criminally fun and easy to watch. I just watched it again at 12:50 a.m. this morning, having not seen it for quite some time, and it not only held my interest, but I learned to appreciate the movie for what it is - again.""The 'burbs"" was directed by Joe Dante, a man with a lot of wit and talent at making dark camp films. ""The Howling,"" which I disliked, was nevertheless superbly directed; ""Gremlins,"" one of my favorite films, was dark, humorous and smart; ""Small Soldiers"" was the perfect example of a unique idea helmed by a man who knew what he wanted; and ""The 'burbs"" is just about the most solid example of Dante's style. Mixing elements from Tim Burton and Steven Spielberg, Dante is one of cinema's better directors, if only because he is great at presenting us with crazy material and doing it tongue-in-cheek and not taking himself too seriously. He's a man with a lot of imagination that crosses over onto his celluloid; I don't think he's as much as a mainstream sellout as he is an old-fashioned storyteller, like an old man who gathers around a campfire at night and tries to scare his audience, but manages to insert some laughs for good measure.What propels ""The 'burbs"" past simple fun and into the realm of strangely addictive and satisfying viewing is the subtle genius of its plot. We all know about those closely-linked neighborhoods where everyone waves at each other in the morning as they collect their papers in their PJs, where the grass is always neatly-trimmed and green; where the newspaper boys always randomly throw papers and miss their targets by at least five feet; and the sort of neighborhoods where everyone is always watching everyone. ""The 'burbs"" is a movie with a lot of good idea, never sampled before or since in any mainstream production I have seen. There will always be movies with the stereotypical suburbs, but rarely will there ever be a movie that mixes them in with the core idea of ""The 'burbs"" - that the people in these suburbs all have quirky traits, and all take spying on each other to an extreme level; to such a level that they would suspect a strange new neighbor to be a mass murderer. ""One day after mowing your lawn you just snap!"" Hanks shouts towards the end of the movie. ""The 'burbs"" is at its best when it's toying around with the suburb clichés and at its worst when it is distracted by tacky subplots. It's technically a rather poor movie, and I can understand why it received negative reviews in 1989. But fifteen years later it stands as an enchanting, but flawed, film that has an undeniably watchable undercurrent flowing through its veins. If this movie were on TV a week from now I'd probably watch it again, just like I have been for years.3/5 stars.John Ulmer",The 'Burbs
32,OllieSuave-007,Horrible horror comedy!,2,16 September 2015,"I was pretty excited for this movie since the plot summary about a suburban family worried that their reclusive and mysterious neighbors might be a cannibalistic cult sounded intriguing. However, what really resulted was just a comedic mess of overzealous and overly excited characters, corny and annoying acting and a slow-moving story.Because of the forced humor that succumbed most of the movie, any suspense and thrills of the mysterious-neighbor plot device was lost. Rick Ducommun was one of the nosy suburbanites and created much of the annoyance and damage to the course of events, as did the childish, clownish and ridiculous Bruce Dern. Corey Feldman tried to pull off a bad boyish teenager look, who really didn't do anything in the film, and Tom Hanks acted like he was overly frustrated much of the time during the movie. I actually thought the mysterious neighbor characters had the best acting and chemistry.There may be a tidbit of thrilling moments in and there, for example, the part where Tom Hanks sneaks into the neighbors' house at night to try to find incriminating evidence. But, don't let the horror genre label fool you - this movie is just a poor attempt at black comedy that even kids won't find funny.Grade D---",The 'Burbs

Not according to this movie!Ray (Tom Hanks) is your average suburbanite. He has a quiet life with his wife (Carrie Fisher) and family. He's trying to spend a quiet week of vacation at home when a couple of his buddies (played by Bruce Dern and Rick Ducommun) convince him that there's something suspicious about the new neighbours who've moved in next door. They've been there for a month; no one has seen them. The house is run down, the grass is unkept. An elderly neighbour has suspiciously gone missing. Something must be wrong. The movie basically unfolds the mystery of these new neighbours and it does that pretty well, so that once they're introduced you do go back and forth between thinking that they're just plain weird and thinking that they're weirdly sinister. Director Joe Dante builds this well. The first hour or so is really fairly low key, and the last 45 minutes starts the buildup to a wild and chaotic conclusion.There are parts of this that are quite funny. I don't know why but the scene in the strange house, when Ray and his wife and friends finally show up to introduce themselves, really worked. I don't know what was so funny about watching Ray eat a sardine on a pretzel but that had me laughing.I enjoyed Tom Hanks. This was still fairly early in his career, and he showed the talent that would eventually lead to his two Oscars. He captured his character well. In fact, the only part of this movie that I really didn't like was the role of Ricky (played by Corey Feldman.)

""THE 'BURBS"" is an outrageously spontaneous and lunatic black comedy by filmmaker Joe Dante. I distinctly love the look and tone of the film. It's expressively photographed and playfully scored by Jerry Goldsmith. The material satirically pokes fun at mundane suburbia by playing on the paranoia of a comfortable lifestyle being disrupted and the consequences of making someone else's business your own.The one-joke premise really does milk out the idea with constant slapstick visual gags, chaotic plot developments and rapid-fire witty dialogues. Once we meet the Klopeks it can get a bit blotchy in its pacing. Nonetheless it implodes again for a crazy finale. I did enjoy the numerous horror references littered throughout and you can't go wrong with a Dick Millar cameo. You could say it's one of the best comic scenes in the film. The madcap combination and comic timing of the ensemble cast is always on the mark. Tom Hanks, Rick Ducommun and Bruce Dern head the laughs. Henry Gibson in a familiar ghoulish role still nails it.

Not only is it funny and a modern satire of suburban life, it is quite creepy and suspenseful. This movie is like an 80's version of Disturbia, but a more funnier version. Not every joke was funny, but many of them were. The movie seems perfect for a Halloween film for families, and this movie ranks up there with another 80's classic, The Goonies. Joe Dante's film is about a suburbanite named Ray Petersen who decides to take the week off. But he is worried about his creepy new neighbors. Along with a crazed military veteran and the eccentric neighbor named Art, they decide to investigate the neighbors when an old man goes missing. I thought the acting was very good. Tom Hanks is a natural actor and gifted at comedy, at least he was in the 80's. He was very good as the man who tries to stay out of trouble. Bruce Dern was absolutely fantastic as the lieutenant who knows the gadgets, but fails to use them correctly. Corey Feldman was decent as the teenage neighbor. Carrie Fisher played the typical wife who persuades her husband to stay out of trouble. Overall, The 'Burbs was an excellent movie that pokes fun at the eccentricity of suburban life. It not only succeeds at being a simple- minded comedy, but it succeeds at being a suspenseful thriller. I liked the ending as it perfectly ended the movie.

During his ""week off"" he has nothing to occupy his time and so takes to intruding upon his new neighbors. The ""foreign"" Klopeks are not following the Mayfield Place rules. Their lawn is dead and weedy, the house is ramshackle and faded, they hardly ever leave or appear outdoors, and they certainly don't bother making friends or filling the void with meaningless chit-chat.A reason enough to be suspicious according to Ray, his screwball pal Art, and ex-military Mark Rumsfield (Rick Ducommun and Bruce Dern, forming a perfect comic trinity). Multiple attempts to ""politely"" get to know the Klopeks fail, so its fair game for trespassing, snooping around, and breaking and entering. It certainly seems like the Klopeks are up to no good but by the end of the movie it's largely irrelevant as the big reveal comes and goes with no explanation or real connection to the story.What The 'burbs does have going for it is manic energy between the cast and a lively, inventive, and massively fun score by Jerry Goldsmith. The supporting cast could have been improved though. Carrie Fisher as ""the wife"" just doesn't do it for me with her mannish hairdo and short stature. It would have been a much better idea to cast someone like Meg Ryan instead. Fisher is loses to Wendy Schaal who is much funnier as Rumsfield's wife. Corey Feldman also loses as an unholy combination Ted ""Theodore"" Logan and Patrick Swayze's Bodhi. His Valley Kid dialect and surfer/80s drop-out culture styling are completely out of place.Despite the shortcomings there is still loads to enjoy with The 'burbs and it will keep you coming back again and again.",The 'Burbs
40,The-Sarkologist,A dark look at American Suburbia,6,5 November 2011,"The 'Burbs is about a cul-de-sac in the average American suburb in the average American city. When the movie opens, it zooms into the middle of the United States to what is simply a normal city. Yet Mayfield Place is anything but normal as weird noises are coming from a house that is very much in need of repair, and has no lawn to speak of. The owners of this house are the Klopeks, a weird, monstrous looking, Slavic family.The inhabitants of the street are a teenager left home by himself to paint he house (Corey Feldman). He spends his time sitting on the porch watching the events of his neigbourhood unfold, and offers some cheer as well. There is the old rich guy who has everything immaculate, and the army head who is right of Hitler. Then there is the neighbour who seems to live in everybody else's house, and finally there is Tom Hanks, who is the sane guy that is influenced by his peers.Everything starts off when the old guy vanishes, and they instantly suspect the Klopeks because they are odd. The thing about this movie is the definition of what is normal, and the pressure of American society to conform. Unfortunately this movie undermines this idea by actually having the Klopeks as being vicious monsters and that unless you are wholeheartedly American (ie like everybody else in this movie) then you are evil and should be arrested and locked up.Tom Hank's spiel really catches the essence of the theme in this movie. Throughout the entire movie the neighbours were causing a lot of problems for the Klopeks, for the main reason that they never left their house and never mingled with the people around them. This is seen as being strange and unamerican - if you do not associate with your neighbours then you must be up to something bad. Hanks says that this is not always true, and the reason some people hide away is not because they are mischievous, but because they are sick of people nosying in on them. He says that it is not the Klopeks who are insane, but those who are convinced that they are up to something.This movie is an attack at suburban, or even American paranoia, that those who do not behave like everybody is out to destroy their way of life. The American's value freedom (and this is written into their constitution) and movies such as this suggest that their pursuit of freedom infringes on the real issue of freedom, and that is for people to live how they like. What truly is freedom, and how far does one go to protect their freedom and not hinder the freedom of others. This is what the movie makes one think about.",The 'Burbs
41,tomgillespie2002,"An amusing ride, but missing something",6,5 August 2014,"Combining two genres that really flourished in the 1980's - horror and man-boy comedy - The 'Burbs is a slightly eerie minor work from Joe Dante, the director that gave us genre classics The Howling (1981) and Gremlins (1984), both of which blended spatters of gore with goofy comedy much more successfully. The 'Burbs just seems to be missing something. Whether it's the surprisingly subdued Tom Hanks, who is allowed only glimpses of the energy he was so famous for in his early days, or the film's failure to really subvert any of our expectations, it's unclear.The grumpy Ray Peterson (Hanks) has just begun his one-week vacation, which he has decided to spend lounging around in his pyjamas and drinking beer rather than going fishing or taking his wife (Carrie Fisher) and son on a trip. He is soon drawn in to best friend Art's (Rick Ducommun) curiosity at the strange behaviour of the street's most recent additions, who have moved into a Gothic building that sticks out like a sore thumb. They keep to themselves and are rarely seen outside the house, but at night, great discharges of electricity flash and boom from their basement. Just what are they up to? Ray, Art and ex-army nut Lt. Rumsfeld (Bruce Dern) are determined to find out, while lazy stoner Ricky (Corey Feldman) enjoys the show from his porch.Every now and then, The 'Burbs throws in a bit of inspiration. Whether it's the crash-zoom, over-the-top screaming of Ray and Art upon learning of possible foul play, Ricky's discovery of reality 'TV' years before morons couldn't get enough of it, or the sight of the strange family digging holes in their lawn where you get a real sense of Dante's skill at horror, we get only glimpses of the film that perhaps could have been. Dante doesn't seem invested in the story somehow, as if it was a half-baked idea that was never given the dedication it needed. The observations of suburban life seem dated, as if torn out of a 1960's comic-strip, and the various vignettes which play out in the early scenes are not as funny as they should be.Apart from Ducommun, whose prat-falls and incessant man-child behaviour gets old very quickly, the cast perform extremely well. When Hanks is occasionally let off the leash, his semi-improvised lunacy reminds us of what he did best before all the Oscar-winning nonsense of Forrest Gump (1994), and Dern is the only consistently funny character in the entire film. But when the credits rolled, I found myself pondering the point of the film. It doesn't sway the plot in any direction other than the one you expect it to go, and although it's a mildly pleasant ride along the way, when Feldman's Ricky says to camera at the climax ""I love this street!"", I couldn't help but think ""why?"".www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",The 'Burbs

43,eddie_baggins,A hugely enjoyable comedy,7,16 December 2014,"Something 80's movies did better than perhaps any other decade was put simply, fun. A huge range of films released in the much loved decade had fun as their number one mantra and director Joe Dante was a filmmaker that well and truly delivered on this front. The Howling, Explorers and his much loved Gremlins were all fine examples of this entertaining spirit that washed over many an 80's gem and Dante tried in similar vein but less successfully to replicate the good times in later films Gremlins 2, Matinée, Small Soldiers, Looney Tunes: Back in Action and The Hole. During this 80's high time of fun Dante produced one of the decades last bastions of silly good times with his 1989 hit, The 'Burbs.A fitting movie for any person that may have found themselves apart of Suburbia, The 'Burbs is a film entirely set in a particularly interesting street where neighbours spy upon neighbours, dogs do their business on other peoples lawns oh and a seemingly murderous family conduct nightly experiments and dig graves in the backyard. Dante taps into the spirit of neighbourly comrade and the gossip that comes with it and makes the brave move of keeping the action entirely set in the suburb of Mayfield Place which gives The 'Burbs a real sense of character and atmosphere that was so prevalent and important to films of its vintage. It's all part of the films charm and gentle tone and makes us the viewer feel a part of the adventures these characters have, led by the always enjoyable Tom Hanks.The 'Burbs features an incredible variety of rag tag figures with Tom Hanks's wishing for a quiet housebound, pyjama clad holiday at home Ray Peterson the central figure. Surrounded by Carrie Fisher's demanding wife Carol, Bruce Dern's army obsessed ex-lieutenant Mark Rumsfield, Ray's obnoxious best friend Art and Corey Feldman's typically loud mouthed teen Ricky, The 'Burbs succeeds most completely at creating an interesting and oft relatable bunch of figures in an at times downright bonkers story. Not a whole lot that happens throughout the movie makes a whole lot of sense, right down to the explosive and overblown finale but it doesn't matter as the key flow on from having too much fun, is not really caring about what does and doesn't seem to glue together.An easy to watch, occasionally laugh out loud tale, The 'Burbs has slowly become a lesser seen example of the 80's comedy staples and a somewhat forgotten part of Tom Hanks's impressive filmography. Joe Dante is still a prevalent filmmaker in today's market but sadly his films have been relegated to direct to disc or TV show fair and it would be lovely to see him once more tap back into his 80's mojo and provide us with something along these lines, as fun is still as important to films as it ever was.3 and a half femur bones out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",The 'Burbs
44,filipemanuelneto,"A forgettable comedy, a little (especialy for me) hard to understand.",4,1 August 2020,"In this film, situational comedy reigns as a trio of crazy neighbours get together to discover what is going on with a family that has just arrived and no one knows yet, but that totally clashes with them. They get to the point of ridicule, entering each other's houses, rummaging through personal possessions and stirring up the most absurd theories about new neighbours. It is a film that it's not for me and I did not find it funny, but rather a little offensive. I do not belong to that culture. I will never understand the American suburban mentality with open lawns, open doors, neighbours who strangely see themselves present at the door of newcomers, with welcome gifts and who seem willing to, amicably, meddle in each other's lives under cover of the friendliest and most well-intentioned thoughts.Starting from this premise of natural cultural difference, I look at this film with some incredulity and, sometimes, shock. A welcome commission on arriving at a new home? It seems absurd to me. Have the worry of introducing myself to my new neighbours? I was never going to do it in my life. Seeing a neighbour invade my home or my private life because they think something strange is going on? Poor guy, he signed his death sentence! For me, situations like those in this film, even the simplest ones, seem unbelievable. For me, an open lawn is an invitation to enter, so the higher the wall and the sharper the barbs on top of it, the better. And a good neighbour is the one who gives me the least trouble. I don't care if I don't know his name or he doesn't give me the good days, as long as he stays in his corner and leaves me in peace and quiet in my corner. It's my culture, it's the world where I was raised, and where that neighbourhood culture doesn't exist. But this film is all about it and shows the sense of community that exists in some American neighbourhoods, where hypocrisy goes hand-in-hand with mutual assistance, as can be seen in the way everyone is concerned about the disappearance of an older character, the same they used to be angry with when his dog poop on their lawn. A sense of community that creates patterns and makes everyone follow similar lives, ostracizing or taxing as ""weirdos"" all those who choose to put themselves out, live a more reserved life or simply adopt different habits. The film stinks of satire, in fact, and it seems a harsh criticism of that way of thinking, but it is a criticism that is not funny to me.Tom Hanks is the main actor, and literally carries the film on his shoulders as he is the best and most talented in the cast. In any case, the characters are stereotypes or just pure comedy figures. There is no depth or complexity, and the work of each actor is simplified to a minimum: saying the lines, making laugh and looking funny. Next to Hanks is a good supporting cast, with strong comedy figures like Rick Ducommun, Bruce Dern and Bruce Dern, as well as a more restrained but very effective Carrie Fisher. Everyone did a good job. The film is not notable for its technical aspects or production values, but the sets and special effects worked very well and helped a lot in the comic effect.For those who like silly comedies and cardboard characters, just to spend some time, this film should work very well. I had a lot of difficulties with this film, I felt the culture and mental clash but I recognize that its not a bad film, although it is totally forgettable.",The 'Burbs
45,funkyfry,fun comedy from Dante,7,5 April 2009,"There was a time in the 1980s when Joe Dante, who directed this film, was almost as hot as Spielberg and Zemeckis. He worked with Spielberg on his most successful films, the Gremlins films. This little film, which looks like it was shot entirely on leftover street sets on the Universal lot, came out of that period. Tom Hanks was still mostly known as a comedian (thank the heavens!), and it was still a time when Corey Felman being in the movie was a sign of hipness. For younger viewers who missed this time, the movie must be a time capsule. I remember seeing it in the theater and enjoying it a lot, and while it hasn't really held up necessarily as one of the best comedies of its era at the very least it offers some fun performances and a neat ironic perspective on suburbia.Hanks plays the suburban everyman, Ray Peterson, whose wife Carol (Carrie Fisher) wants him to relax and enjoy his vacation but whose best friends in the neighborhood (Bruce Dern and Rick Docummun) want him to take part in their juvenile spying games. When it starts to look more and more like their strange Eastern European neighbors might actually be serial killers or something of the sort, Ray and his friends go to extreme measures to try to infiltrate the spooky house.Rick Docummun is a bit annoying for the amount of screen time he gets here, but Bruce Dern is the best thing about the movie. He plays a paranoid 'Nam veteran with a trophy wife (Wendy Schaal) and an overdose of tenacity. Fisher and Hanks are good as the central couple as well. Feldman is awfully irritating in this movie because Dante chooses to let him basically narrate to the camera as if he were Frankie Avalon or Ferris Bueller. The brilliant comic actor Brother Theodore and notable character actor Henry Gibson are wonderful as the bizarre Klopeks. Dante/Corman regular Dick Miller shows up in a funny bit as a conservative garbage collector paired with a hippy type partner (Robert Picardo) who insists that the customers have the right to look at their neighbors' trash. I would have liked to see a whole movie just about Picardo and Miller.The unfortunate thing about the film is that it promises a lot more than it delivers. The first 20 or 30 minutes are great, with setting up the fun characters and the goofy situation. But by the end everything is a bit forced. There's no reason for Dr. Klopek to betray himself so obviously, it seems like it was just done to wrap the film up on a sort of ""Twilight Zone"" vibe that doesn't fit the tone of the film. It could have been a smarter movie if Hanks' character and his friends truly were delusional. But for whatever this movie is, I'll take it. It's pretty much the last movie that I thought Hanks was funny in (no, not ""Joe Versus the Volcano"" no thank you). It was great to see Carrie Fisher in the movie after she hadn't been on screen in any movies I'd seen in a few years, and it's still fun to see her in this kind of domestic housewife situation. She could always add a funny moment or two to a comedy, as she did in ""Austin Powers"" as well. The early parts of the movie though seem to promise something like Tim Burton's ""Edward Scissorhands"", a smart dark comedy on suburban absurdity, but the film doesn't really follow through.",The 'Burbs
46,southdavid,Butcher of Suburbia,5,19 November 2020,"Another film that I'd seen before, but not in a while, ""The 'Burbs"" showed up on Amazon Prime and I decided to give it a rewatch. If I'm honest, I found it a bit light on comedy to make it a worthwhile recommendation.A group of neighbours in the Suburbs of an American town come to believe that their mysterious new neighbourhood family are murderers. Led by Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks) and supported by Army Vet. Mark Rumsfield (Bruce Dern) and actual idiot, Art Weingartner (Rick Ducommun) the group bind together to investigate the house and are speared on when another neighbour, Walter (Gale Gordon), disappears.""The 'Burbs"" is a very 1980's film, in terms of fashions, sensibilities and the fact that Corey Feldman is in it. Tom Hanks is ridiculously young looking but is already a decent leading man and has nice chemistry with Carrie Fisher, who plays his put-upon wife. They are the sensible grounded pair in the film, with Dern playing the ex-military man who has somehow snagged a beautiful wife who is twenty years younger than him, played by Wendy Schaal. Rick Ducommun is someone who I didn't really know, despite being in dozens of films that I enjoy. I found his character here though to be more annoying than funny.Despite some amusing moments, generally I found ""The 'Burbs"" to be a comedy that wasn't very funny. Too many pratfalls and too light in jokes completely in the second half. I don't believe in the world either, by which I mean nobody reacts to anything in this with any degree of believability and I have to admit that I was bored by the story well before it's conclusion.I do like Joe Dante films, and I was around in the 80's to see these films the first time, but reassessing this one now I'm afraid it doesn't do much for me.",The 'Burbs

When people, animals, start to go missing, there goes the neighborhood. Paranoid neighbors, Hanks, and his real paranoid eccentric neighbor, (a marvelous Bruce Dern) are determined to get to the bottom of this. Just check out Hank's ""C'mon, you want to f..k with me, I'll take you on"" expression on the cover. The Burbs, sadly wastes some bloody good actors, though we're glad to have them in this mess of suburbia, where in the end, The Burbs don't add up to much, in a sort of ho hum way.

Tom Hanks plays the lead, a meek all-American dad who's plagued by quirky neighbors throughout his long-awaited staycation. There's a lot of truth at the core of these characters, who should seem quite familiar to anyone who's ever so much as visited a similar neighborhood, but their personalities are so thoroughly overinflated that at some point they cross a hidden line and become straight-up cartoon characters. The storyline, which seems to have plenty of fuel to burn in the setting alone, is strangely preoccupied with other things. What seems like a simple side story, about the creepy neighbors in the big, spooky, haunted house, instead dominates the entire picture, taking the film in weird, obsessive directions. Hanks is good as the weary everyman, deeply curious but terrified of confrontation, and he enjoys good help from his supporting cast: Carrie Fisher, Bruce Dern and Rick Ducommun work well together as the not-quite-cordial neighborhood welcoming committee. It's strange to see Corey Feldman, just four years removed from The Goonies, as a hard-drinking, home-owning Spicoli clone, but it works for him.

54,barnabyrudge,"Thinly plotted parody, boosted by clever performances and an atmosphere of suspenseful paranoia.",7,27 December 2006,"Joe Dante is exactly the right director for this kind of parody about suburban paranoia. His ability to put a humorous slant on dark and twisted stories is put to good effect in The 'Burbs, a light-hearted tale of sinister goings-on in small-town America. While the story itself is thin and inconsequential, the clever playing by the cast of oddball character actors is a joy to watch and compensates for a lot. It's particularly interesting to see pre-superstardom Tom Hanks in another of the roles that nudged him up the star ladder, plus Carrie Fisher doing something other than Princess Leia, and of course Bruce Dern as an intimidating ex-soldier struggling to adapt to a quiet life in the suburbs.Mayfield Place is a small cul-de-sac in an unspecified town in America. It resembles any one of a million streets all over the country. Pretty much the most normal residents on the street are the Petersons - Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks), his wife Carol (Carries Fisher), and their young son (Cory Danziger). They are surrounded by wackos and oddballs such as paranoid Art Weingartner (Rick Ducommun), ex-military man Mark Rumsfield (Bruce Dern) and his flirtatious young wife Bonnie (Wendy Schaal), dumb teenager Ricky Butler (Corey Feldman) and unsociable old timer Walter (Gale Gordon). But the oddest family of all lives next door to the Petersons. The Klopeks are reclusive Eastern Europeans who live in a run-down house that comes straight from the world of nightmares. No-one ever sees them out and about, but strange noises come from their basement in the middle of the night and they have a strange habit of digging holes in their back yard under the cover of darkness. During a week off work, Ray gradually convinces himself  with a little help from his OTT neighbours  that the Klopeks are mass murderers. When old Walter mysteriously vanishes, Ray is sure that he's the latest victims of the Klopek killing spree so he hatches a plan to break into their house and find the corpse..Dante creates a very believable atmosphere of paranoia, where the resident's prejudice against the Klopeks seems intentionally absurd, yet at the same time suspenseful. We laugh at these nosy neighbours because their actions against the Klopek family are outrageous, but at the same time the Klopeks appear so wonderfully weird and creepy that we find ourselves believing that they might be mass murderers. Hanks plays the normal family man caught up in what might be a non-existent adventure with fabulous skill, upstaged only by Dern, who is hilarious as the demented army freak. Dern manages to make even the straightest of lines amusing with his acerbic delivery  at one point he tells an interfering teenage neighbour to ""shut up and paint your goddamn house!"" and succeeds in making this simplest of lines hysterically funny. The film is deceptively simple, with much less going on than actually seems to be the case, but generally-speaking it works very well. If you've ever had suspicions that your neighbours are up to no good, it's definitely a film that will plant some outrageous thoughts in your head!",The 'Burbs

(spoilers),7,3 June 2004,"The 'burbs is classic 80s fare from director Joe Dante (it even features his two casting regulars, Dick Miller and Robert Picardo). It looked like a lot of fun to make. Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks) and his neighbors live in the epitome of Suburbia. They're very neighborly folks (aka nosy) who spend most of their time primping their yards and spying on their neighbors, the reclusive Klopeks who just moved in next door to Ray. They live in the only desolate house on the block, the one with the dried up grass and lone, dead tree in the front yard. At night, when Ray walks his dog, he hears strange noises and sees weird things coming from the Klopek's house. So, everyone in the neighborhood assumes the only logical thing--that the Klopeks are murderers.When their neighbor Walter goes missing, Ray and his idiot friend, Art (Rick Ducommun) are sure the Klopek's murdered him and buried him in the backyard. When the Klopek's leave their house to attend a University lecture for the day, Ray declares ""I'm going over there and I'm not coming back until I find a dead body. Nobody knocks off an old man in my neighborhood and gets away with it."" Ray's wife, Carol (Carrie Fisher) is fed up with Art and Ray, as they continuously seem to get into trouble in trying to prove their theory that the Klopeks are murderers. But, when the cat's away, the mice will play.All the while, you're left wondering whether their paranoia has overtaken them, or whether the Klopeks really are capable of murder. It's always the quiet ones...There's a lot to enjoy here in this stupid comedy. Bruce Dern, above all else, is my favorite character as Ray's neighbor, Mark Rumsfield who is usually hilariously wimpy despite being a former soldier. (During a break from the final invasion, Rumsfield sits atop his roof carefully nibbling the heads off of animal crackers). Or when Art has to climb up an electrical pole to cut the power to the Klopek's house, Ray asks Mark why he didn't climb up there. ""It's very high,"" he says innocently. And I get the most laughs during the conversation Mark has with Uncle Rueben Klopek (Brother Theodore) when they all get together and pay the family a visit. ""About a nine on the tension scale, eh Rub?"" he asks the annoyed brother.Art is pretty funny too because he's a giant idiot who is really responsible for the mess that he and Ray and Mark get in when they go snooping around the Klopek's house. And, 80s fans won't want to miss Corey Feldman who, despite previously being an annoying teenager in later films, is actually quite funny here as slacker neighbor Ricky Butler who ""really knows how to throw a party."" He knows that if Ray, Mark, and Art are up to something, then it's worth calling up all his rock n' roll stoner friends to come over and check out the action. ""This is my life. This is my neighborhood,"" he says proudly. Says Mark Rumsfield to his wife about Ricky, ""that kids a meatball.""Joe Dante really does a good job here and works with a fantastic cast of characters, especially the supporting cast, in this story that parodies Suburban life. It's a really funny movie that is best for 80s fans. Loosen up and give it a go.",The 'Burbs

61,Movie-ManDan,"""I Called The Pizza Dude!""",9,7 February 2021,"Joe Dante is not that good of a director. He hit a luck-shot in 1989 with his thrilling and hilarious deranged comedy ""The 'Burbs."" No disrespect to ""Gremlins"" or ""Small Soldiers,"" but his 1989 flick remains his very best.Fresh off his breakout blockbuster, ""Big"" Tom Hanks is just as good as average-joe named Ray. He is married to Carrie Fisher and they live in a nice suburban neighbourhood where everyone knows everyone.The beauty of the flick is we are introduced to a group of friends and neighbours that are unique, real, and likeable. Ray is a normal man in need of a vacation. His best friend, Art (the underrated Rick Ducommun in his best role) is the dumb one of the group; Mark (Bruce Dern) is a retired army veteran who always uses his expertise; and Ricky (Corey Feldman) is a wise-cracking teenage metalhead. Right away, we love these characters. These people drive the film as the best ones do.Ray and his friends begin to suspect that their new, creepy neighbours-the Klopeks-are killers. The house is rotting, the people look messed up, and they have heard stories about killings. These bored suburbanites are willing to believe anything. When one of their neighbours goes missing, Ray and company suspect the family are the culprits.The audience has reason to believe that the Klopeks are as sadistic as they look. We see them through the eyes of Ray, Art and Mark. Since the movie tackles all of this in such funny and clever ways, we know that there will be twists that will heighten the experience.Throughout the film we wonder if the family are truly sickos or if Ray and company are just plain paranoid. See the film for yourself and have a roller coaster of fun.Cheers to Hanks, Dern, Ducommun, Feldman and Fisher for bringing to life a film of great pleasure.3.5/4",The 'Burbs

Unless someone were to slot it under ''s@do-m@sochism,"" in which case it would at least be accurately labelled. Because you'd really have to hate yourself to sit through it.The acting is over the top, particularly by Bruce Dern and Corey Feldman. To Tom Hanks' credit, it took him at least a half hour into this dull mess to start up with his usual unfunny screaming shtick. I'll say it again, if Hanks' agent had not got him the lead role in Philadelphia, we would be talking about a washed-up comedian who peaked in the mystifyingly popular lzzbian affirmation sports comedy, A League Of Their Own before going on to star in Celebrity Apprentice and as guest host of The Price Is Right.The smug, obnoxious, um, ''patriotic American whiteness"" of this particular burb deserved a comeuppance, but it didn't pay off.

63,screenman,Decent American Comedy,7,27 June 2010,"Tom Hanks offers up another of those performances that cemented him as a Hollywood top-earner. Here he's a hapless suburbanite in a modern development of variously odd-ball people who find themselves suddenly confronted by the family from weirdness inc. These people move into an inexplicably blighted-looking empty house in the street and do - nothing.It's for the 'normal' neighbours, who are anything but, to lose control of their curiosities and goad comparatively reasonable Tom Hanks into spear-heading their paranoia. Most of the comic situations are typical American slapstick, but the timing is good and there's a sprinkling of witty or crude one-liners that move the otherwise flatulent effort along.However; it transpires that these neighbours really are a devilish crowd. The movie ramps-up a gear as even the scathingly pragmatic wife - here well played by Carrie Fisher, in between Jedi romances - becomes infected by the common suspicion. There are car crashes, houses catch fire, misunderstandings accumulate. A downhill out-of-control stretcher-ride through the suburb culminates the denouement.I think this movie deserves a '7' because it does at least find something to keep your attention most of the time, whether it's slap-stick stupidity, script, or situation comedy. Not exactly collectible, but well worth at least one watch.",The 'Burbs

It was creative and original, the actors are all excellent, it was funny as hell and the soundtrack was brilliant. Weingard (is that the proper spelling?) was HILARIOUS, that guy is really what gives the film its comedic spark, and the plot of ""what's going on next-door?"" adds an extra creepy element to it to give it some edge.To properly enjoy this film, it's better watching with with your friends.

65,Howlin Wolf,Too self-consciously weird to be funny.,3,6 April 2001,"Weirdness can work in sketch format.  This is because there is no setup or explanation required for what is going on; the humour is supposed to be instantaneous.  We see something that is weird on screen, and we laugh because it is weird, also in the knowledge that whatever's on screen will go away shortly.   There is potential for comedy to be found in the premise of ""The 'burbs"", but unfortunately the script fails to extract any of it.  I know the ineptitude of the film can be traced directly back to the quality (or lack thereof) of the script, because director Joe Dante is capable of crafting great entertainment given the right material (""Gremlins"", ""Innerspace""). There are also a number of usually reliable performers here struggling with the weakness of what they are given.  The paucity of the end result that reaches our screens can be explained by the approach that the script tries to take.   This is a feature film, so some attempt should have been made to flesh out the main character, to make the audience relate to him.  You have a basic plot here, USE IT!  USE IT TO AT LEAST HALF OF ITS FULL POTENTIAL PLEASE!!!  There is no need for the humour here to be instantaneous like a sketch show, because we're working from a much broader canvas where the plot can even be established before the humour arrives.  The 'sketch' analogy that describes the approach of the movie presents various problems which dog the film throughout its running time.  In a sketch, we laugh because something is weird.  In a film, we expect the comedy to originate from the situation that has been presented to us. Too often in this film, we are shown things that are strange, and are expected to laugh because of this, despite the fact that their importance to the situation is TOTALLY arbitrary.  The situation would still be the same if they weren't there, they're just thrown in to make us laugh.  I would say though, that if you can't develop the situation competently enough so that it makes us laugh on its own, without the aid of cheap gimmicks, then comedy isn't your forte.  That's a message to the writers...  Also, as I said, we laugh at a sketch because we know it will be over shortly.  It should be obvious that the funny parts of the sketch are not strong enough to be sustained over a longer period.  One of the worst things about watching ""The 'burbs"" is that if you don't find the 'awkward' weirdness funny (as you can surmise I didn't), you know that the execution period won't be mercifully brief, unlike a sketch.  It was an awful moment when I realised I had to sit through this unfunny tosh for AT LEAST another hour and twenty minutes...   If you like the idea of stupid events that don't sit well with the overall plot of the film, then you might like this.  The rest of us will just scratch our heads in wonder at why anybody might enjoy a comedy that is otherwise laugh-free.",The 'Burbs
66,Screen_Blitz,Darkly funny Tom Hanks comedy doesn't quite hold up,5,11 January 2017,"Comedies were definitely not the same in the 80s as they are today. The 80s was the decade of some of the most unconventional comedies that inspired many comedic tropes incorporated in countless entries in the genre since then. Evidence can shown by the evolutionary change in humor over the decades, from the quirky days of the National Lampoon franchise, to the age of over-the-top R-rated sex comedies have now dominated the comedy genre since the dawn of the 90s. This quirky dark comedy directed by Joe Dante who brought this part-comedy, part-horror piece 'Gremlins' in 1984 stars Tom Hanks less than half a decade from the more dramatic work he is often known for. The 'Burbs places its likable cast in a mix bag of quirky slapstick humor and darkly humorous gags while taking an unconventional approach on the Suburban culture during the Cold War-era. For a comedy, it should have been funner than it is. Unfortunately, it pervades with an outlandish style of humor that by today's standards, feels awfully dated and just plain silly. Set in an suburban neighborhood in Des Moines, Iowa, this film follows Ray Paterson (played by Tom Hanks), a lazy man in this thirties taking a week off from work to lay around the house and possibly spend time with his wife Carol (played by Carrie Fisher) and his son Dave (played by Corey Danziger). When a mysterious family of demon worshippers moves next door, Ray's paranoid neighbor Art (played by Rick Ducommun) and his army-retired neighbor across the street Mark Rumsfield (played by Bruce Dern) grow incredibly suspicious them, fearing they might be sadists.Although Tom Hanks is more of a veteran in the non-comedic territory particularly when looking at his work in films like 'Philadelphia', 'Saving Private Ryan', and 'Forrest Gump', he has still demonstrated evidence that he is capable of showing his comedic side (even if his comedic works don't come as memorable). Hanks demonstrates a fair amount of comedic chemistry here, but is it enough to carry the film on his shoulders? Not quite, and either are his co-stars Bruce Dern and Rick Ducommun. This darkly funny comedic piece boasts a somewhat promising premise that some individuals growing up in a suburban community can relate to, and it clear early on that Joe Dante and writer Dana Olson hold intentions to tap into viewers' funny bones. But throughout the time Tom Hanks, Rick Ducommun, and Bruce Dern come on screen, there are only less than a handful of moments when they are successfully funny. This trio show a decent amount of chemistry between each other along with a few hilarious one-liners. But the film too often relies on silly slapstick gags and macabre humor that often evoke nothing more than a snicker than a fully fledged laugh. Most of the time movie works is when it dives into the darker territory when the characters are forced to encounter the neighborhood demonic deeds, plenty of thrills to be offered there. The only one who remains remotely consistent in terms of laughter is Corey Feldman as Bruce Dern's loud-mouth teenage neighbor who shows out with a few energetic one-liners each time he comes on screen. Everyone else appears to struggle on providing the proper laughter viewers deserve.The 'Burbs is a semi-entertaining dark comedy that has its clever moments here and there but doesn't quite hold up to this day. In conclusion, it never rises up the more memorable works of Tom Hanks though that is not to say this is his worst. After all, he at least takes his time to shine here.",The 'Burbs

Joe Dante puts in a few western references in this tale of some weird neighbors somewhere in an upscale suburban cul-de-sac, spying on... their weird neighbors. Though not hilariously funny all the time, the actors work well together and their mostly slapstick-based endeavors make for plenty pleasant viewing, as do the almost dreamlike surroundings in which it all takes place.But just when I thought Dante would end on an intelligent note about unjustifiable paranoia, he throws in a (in itself pretty funny) twist that keeps 'The 'burbs' from being anything intelligent or reasonable; 'if your neighbors are weird and keep to themselves, they're probably mass-murderers'... hmmm, well...Could have done with a lot more sharpness and subtlety. 6 out of 10.",The 'Burbs

He, along with fellow dimwits Dern and Ducommun, set out to prove his suspicions right; with pretty much hilarious results.Director Joe Dante always has a big humorous side to his movies, even in his relatively straight horror flicks ""Piranha"" and ""The Howling"". In the latter he even managed to cleverly make fun of self help groups so evident in the latter part of the 70's and early 80's with great results. Here the folks in suburbia take quite a beating and the stereotypes depicted are not flattering at all.As for the jokes; most of them work really well. ""The 'burbs"" is also quite stylishly creepy at times, especially during the night scenes early on and a well realised dream sequence. Tom Hanks, Rick Ducommun and especially Bruce Dern are all having a good day here and supporting players are no eye sore either (Carry Fisher still looking quite lovely).As said, I may have done the movie in with too many viewings but the fact remains that this flick is very funny and combines well horror elements and relatively goofy fun.Highly recommended.",The 'Burbs
70,Stampsfightclub,A wonderful parody of the suburbs - Hanks steals it,9,27 October 2009,"On a week off from work Ray Peterson (Hanks) and his neighbours become suspicious of the new residents next door who are hardly ever seen in daylight.In and amongst The Da Vinci Code, Charlie Wilson's War and Cast Away it is easy to forget how brilliant a comedy actor Tom Hanks is.Has it really been over 20 years since his first Oscar nomination in the groundbreaking Big? That vintage scene stealing presence with a charming innocence was exquisite method acting by the American, in which his child was trapped inside the vulnerable adult figure. Of course you only have to visit a few years back for his last ""comedy"" if you can call The Lady-killers that. Dark reality humour encoded but his awkwardness peeked through in perhaps the Coen's worst picture.Nevertheless here we were in 1989 having come back off the monumental success of Big and Hanks was up and running towards Hollywood stardom and this Joe Dante picture showcased much more of the comic genius of its central star.With a plot spilling out mystery about quiet and non fundamental neighbours this is a perfect example of what society in the suburbs is reflected as from an outsider's view. You only have to flick on the TV to see the same representation in a sitcom such as Desperate Housewives or a film in Little Children to find gossipy neighbour's prying eyes over their fence for a good nosy at everyone else's dirty laundry.The Burbs' sensationally capitalizes on this conformed ideology of the nosy neighbour by parodying all the way through by running delicious gags at how formula and formality gets shaken up by the arrival of the unknown. This is simply staggering, the benchmark to judge what is and isn't out of realism.Spilling with parodies, over the top pranks and marvellously hyperbole suspicions about the activities, this is vintage physical comedy with people getting hit, top actors screaming silly and dog mess on the front lawn.But if this sounds a bit over the top then no need to worry as come the end there are so many turnarounds you'll be spinning and a wonderful shouting emotion from Hank's Ray that you know he is telling the truth and everything never feels the same again.Dante adds wonderful spice to this picture. Opening with a conventional bird's eye view of the suburb we see his intent to make everything normal but then when the mystery builds and the wind blows at night with the garbage can then the director lets his exuberance flow and this flies from normal everyday life to wondrous fantastical comedy horror with some splendid sets and a purposeful tension overflow for extra laughs.Hank's is brilliant as is everyone and everything; this is splendid comedy and a true reflection with an added spice of misrepresentation.",The 'Burbs

It is very successful at being a light, suspenseful, comedy. It's a fun, old, blast-from-the-past, movie with a weird script and solid, workmanlike, but unexceptional acting. Strange new neighbors move into Tom Hank's 'hood, and he and his current (also) strange neighbors begin to suspect that they're not entirely benign, which sets up the comical investigations to follow.I can't believe I never saw this before, and while it's not great film-making by any means, it's different enough and well-done enough to be easily justify the time spent on it, and, if it's a concern of yours, it's very clean to boot.",The 'Burbs

The one few of your friends know, but you could quote all day long? (My brother and I still refer to weird neighbors as ""Klopeks"").That's The 'Burbs for me. A small gem by Joe Dante, this black comedy follows a bunch of nosy neighbors investigating a strange family. Ominous noises erupt from their cellar at night; dark shapes dig in the garden at unlikely hours; when an elderly man disappears, schlub Ray (Tom Hanks in one of his best comedic roles) and his pals take action.The movie co-stars a young and pretty Carrie Fisher as Ray's wife Carol, Rick Ducommun as a petty conspiracy theorist and Corey Feldman. Best of all is the great Bruce Dern as unhinged senior veteran Rumsfield, a mix between John Goodman from The Big Lebowski and Clint Eastwood from Gran Torino. In a casting gag, Henry Gibson as the Klopek patriarch sees the other side of his famous Fright Night role.Thanks to Dante's deft touch and to sly performances, even little moments shine. My favorite is probably the sardines scene: Carol attempts to take charge of the situation and have a civil meeting with the Klopeks, who offer them a nasty-looking snack with pretzels and sardines. Rumsfield keeps badgering the neighbors (""Hans! A FINE Christian name... Hans Christian Andersen!""), with Ray uselessly trying to deflate tension; when the situation escalates, Ray jumps from the couch and rushes to the bathroom. It's silly, but has me in stitches every time. Even throwaway lines are brilliant (""He is not coming out until he resembles the man I married!"", ""We don't have that kind of time!"").Jerry Goldsmith provides one of his best comedic soundtracks, throwing in everything from sinister organs to Morricone-inspired guitar blasts.Brisk, clever and endlessly quotable.9/10",The 'Burbs

It's not as mindless as ""The Bachelor Party"" or ""The Money Pit"", though. There is quite a bit of rattiness in there. As the title says this movie is about suburban life and it gives a good roasting to the bored, nosy inhabitants of the ""'burbs"".Tom Hanks plays Ray Peterson, who is somehow the hero of the story and the leader of the neighborhood. He always acts as if he was the reasonable guy when he's really no different from his acquaintances. He's a henpecked husband and he spies on the Klopeks, the strange new people who moved in next door, just like everybody else does. Ray and his friends suspect weird ongoings in their new neighbors' house and begin to investigate the disappearance of Walter, an old man from the block.Besides its satirical look at small-minded small town-folk, ""The 'burbs"" is first and foremost a light comedy with countless classic one liners and hilarious characters, all embodied perfectly by the respective actors (I always thought that Dan Aykroyd would have made a great Art, but Rick Ducommun also did a fantastic job).Director Joe Dante, the man who had also made ""Gremlins"", ""Innerspace"" and ""Explorers"", is a master when it comes to making dark adventure movies, so ""The 'burbs"" has more than just a touch of that, too. As Peter and his pals begin their investigation with all their supposed cleverness and their military spying toys one feels like watching ""The Goonies"", except with grown men in a grown up world. (Speaking of ""The Goonies"", Corey Feldman is in this movie, too, in one of his last great roles as the neighborhood's ""meatball"" MTV kid.) We, the audience, get sucked into the adventure ourselves. We also want to know whether the Klopeks are just cranky people or if they're really hiding something.

83,FilmFlaneur,Political Allegory?,9,26 March 2007,"The 'burbs: one of those rare occasion where political allegory slipped virtually unnoticed into a mainstream Hollywood product (another perhaps being the anti-isolationist strictures of Open Water (2003)), the prescience of which seems more relevant today than it ever was. In a street of mutually complacent, smugly democratic neighbours comes a rogue family of unknowns, whose differing life style, secretive manner and foreign manner invites suspicion. Feeling their overtures are rebuffed, 'our' side concoct increasingly bizarre suspicions and allegations against the new arrivals, driving them into isolation until damage and conflict inevitably occurs after increasing ostracisation... Alert viewers may notice an amusing similarity of names: Art Weingarter - Caspar Weinberger (Reagan's hawkish Secretary of State), or see in Bruce Dern's Vietnam-eccentric a broader caricature of the military complex which frequently inform American national debate, in which foreign policy is often shrill, polarized between support of those we know and deep suspicion of those we don't. Others have expressed disappointment in the ending which, although neat enough, is conventional and a little false, primarily due to it running against the previous scheme of things. I felt the same disappointment incidentally at the end of Lehmann's Heathers (1989) of the same year, when I really wanted that whole rotten school demolished by explosives, corrupt institutions and all) The reason why the end of The 'burbs feels odd is that it leaves the allegory considerably compromised by a last minute reassurance that yes, We were right all along - while Ricky's final 'I love this street' is enough to urge viewers that, with all faults, America is still the best place to be. But, especially in this modern world of increasing intolerance towards other cultures (by both sides), and some mistaken assumptions as to the intentions of 'rogue states', on to well known, controversial adventuring abroad, it's worth seeing this brave film again.",The 'Burbs
84,richieandsam,A good 80's film... but there are much better out there.,7,9 November 2013,"THE 'BURBSI had never seen this before yesterday.The movie is about a street where everyone knows everyone. But one of the new neighbours is unlike everyone else. They only come out at night, they don't look after their house like everyone else, they spend the night digging in the back yard. The rest of the street start talking and a couple of the guys decide to snoop around as they have suspicions that the new neighbours have killed their other neighbour.This is a dark comedy from the late 80's. It is funny, but i would not say this is an 80's classic. It definitely had that 80's feel which I love and the story was entertaining, but i just felt that all of these actors have done much better films.The movie stars Tom Hanks﻿ as Ray. Tom is brilliant as always. He did not disappoint at all. Tom is in my top 5 actors of all time. He has made so many fantastic movies. This film also stars Bruce Dern, Rick Ducommun, Carrie Fisher, Corey Feldman﻿ and Henry Gibson. The casting was very good. It is a very strong cast list. Corey Feldman is another actor that is in my top 5 favourite actors list. I always thought that he didn't get the recognition that he deserved. When he was younger he was an amazing actor, with a very impressive CV. I love so many of his movies. I have actually met Corey twice now. The first time I met him he was really friendly and very chatty. I spoke with him and Corey Haim that day. It was so good to meet them and tell them that I loved their work. The second time I met him, he was not as nice. He pretty much ignored me. He signed an autograph for me, but basically sat on his mobile phone texting someone and laughing with his friends. I would understand if I was bothering him in the street, but he was at an official signing. It was a disappointment. But that does not take anything away from him as an actor. He is still in my top 5. Carrie did a good job in this movie. She played Toms wife. I found this very difficult to come to term with. I don't know why, they just didn't seem to go well together. Maybe I am still struggling to think of her as Princess Leia. I should have got over that by now. I have seen quite a few of Carries films, but she will always be the princess to me.There were a few slapstick moments in the film, which I found very funny. There were a few laugh out loud moments too, but not too many. I was expecting this to be funnier than it was, but it was still good.I really liked the ending too. It was full of twists and it did keep me guessing.I will give this film 7 out of 10.""Now they know that we know that they know that we know.""For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",The 'Burbs
85,DavidSim240183,Nice setup. Engaging middle half. Shame about the ending,9,31 August 2007,"On every street, there is that one house that looks dilapidated. A house no-one would ever dream of living in, but they do. And you can't help but wonder about the lives of the people in that house. What are they like? What are they up to? They're a family who keep to themselves, which makes you all the more curious about them.Joe Dante's The Burbs takes this conceit to the wackiest of heights. And its quite a fascinating little film too. Because it paints an interesting picture around a group of suburbanites. People who live mundane, sheltered lives who are just dying for a little excitement to shake up the status quo. The film falls apart at the end, but up until then, it was a fun ride.Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks) is taking a weeks vacation at home. He just wants to get away from the stresses of work, lounge around the house, watch TV, guzzle a few beers and watch the world pass him by.But he doesn't get the chance. A family called the Klopeks moved onto the block a month ago. Their house looks like something out of the Amityville Horror. Hardly anyone goes in or out. They dig up the garden by night. And arcs of electricity are seen through the basement windows. What are they up to?Ray lives next door to these people. And although his curiosity is piqued, it quickly turns to suspicion and then paranoia, thanks in no small part to his fellow neighbours Mark and Art. Mark's a Vietnam vet who treats the neighbourhood like a battlefield. And Art is a walking encyclopaedia on gruesome murders.The Klopek's odd behaviour and appearance spurs our threesome into action. And their ambition to unravel the mystery turns to obsession until all hell breaks loose.The Burbs is quite an enjoyable film for about three quarters of the way through. I liked the way Joe Dante directs the events. The change in the characters emotions from harmless curiosity to outright paranoia is very well conveyed. And Dante has great fun shifting tones.There's something almost Hitchcockian to it, with a little black humour thrown in for good measure. A fellow neighbour goes missing. A human bone turns up in the back garden. The Klopek's themselves look like extended cousins of the Addams family. And inevitably things erupt into chaos.Because of Joe Dante's cartoony style of film-making, things do sometimes overbalance into childish farce. But for the most part, he keeps things going at a brisk pace.If you look hard enough, there's a hidden subtext the film touches base with at times. The town of Hinckley Hills is a suburban conformists dream. Neatly trimmed lawns. Freshly painted homes. And then a family moves in that couldn't be more different. The idea is that the townsfolk are upset by this interruption into their ordered lives, and want to restore the delicate balance. That idea comes out a bit muddled from time to time, but when The Burbs gets its priorities right, its a very good film indeed.Its such a shame then that the film takes a nosedive in the final act. At the end, the Klopek's home is blown up thanks to Ray's nosiness. The Klopeks witness this. And in that one moment, you feel real sadness for them. You realise how wrong you've been. They've lost their home thanks to some stupid people who couldn't respect their privacy and just leave well enough alone. Tom Hanks makes a very angered (if heavy-handed) speech about their own stupidity. They're the ones climbing over fences, breaking into people's homes and even blowing them up. They're the real lunatics.If the film had ended on that note, it would have been much better. But instead it cops out with an entirely false ending where the Klopek's were the bad guys after all. It sends out the strange message that Ray & Co's antics were completely justified. And that is an ending I just couldn't buy into.What a shame! The Burbs had the potential to be a scathing attack on the lives of suburbia. And with anarchist Joe Dante at the helm, I thought it couldn't go wrong. If only he had the courage to see things through to the end, he could have had something really special here. Dante explored this to far greater effect in Gremlins, and in the wonderful suburban paranoia TV series Eerie Indiana.Oh well, fun while it lasted! Still, The Burbs has much to recommend, especially the wonderfully wacky film score from the late Jerry Goldsmith. Just don't be too surprised if you feel entirely cheated when the credits roll.",The 'Burbs
86,AvidClimber,The 'Burbs — Suburbia antics and over active imagination,6,6 January 2013,"The 'Burbs is silly to say the least. Imagine goofy suburbanite neighbors with a over active imaginations, add strange new comers, and you can get where it's going.Most of the action takes place on the outside set, and it really gives this small neighborhood a lived-in feel. With the different point of views, and each persona well integrated, the whole place quickly becomes real in your mind.It's definitely from a late 80s mold and it doesn't go out of its way to break it, but it has aged well. The story line is interesting, and the antics of our eager spies comical enough to make us easily forget that it is getting old.There's only two scenes I don't like. 1) Art's over eating. Movies often over do it when it comes to food, and food noise, but that's ridiculous. At least, it's all located in a single spot and it doesn't spill over the rest of the film. 2) The husband and wife fight which is poorly placed to serve as a hinge.Finally, I only realized last year that the wife of the main character is Carrie Fisher, miss Princess Leia herself. After Star Wars, it got difficult to pick her out of a lineup, and this movie is a good example of that. She's not a bad actress, she's just a plain one.It's good entertainment, if you don't mind the 80s or if you're a fan of Tom Hanks.",The 'Burbs

88,Li_85,One of the funniest films ever made,10,12 June 2006,"This is one of the funniest movies ever made. A brilliant mix of slapstick, intelligent comedy, with shades of darkness. I thought of Tom Hanks as a serious actor, but he proves that he can master comedy. The Burbs is a simple tale of a group of neighbours who suspect the new family in their neighbourhood of being strange. They suspect that this new family are killers. The Ending of this movie is a perfect ending, for those who have not seen this movie, its better if you see it for your self. The Burbs was not a BIG Hit that it deserves. I'm my opinion this is a very underrated movie that deserves recognition. Many people have not heard of this film, which is a surprise. If you haven't seen this movie, then i recommend you buy it. It is worth the price, with 2 hours of entertainment. I'm sure you will not be disappointed.",The 'Burbs
89,jcbutthead86,"An Excellent,Hilarious,Underrated Black Comedy. Tom Hanks And Joe Dante At Their Best.",10,26 September 2013,"The 'Burbs is a brilliant,hilarious and underrated Black Comedy that mixes great direction,a terrific cast,a wonderful script,amazing laughs and a fantastic score making The 'Burbs not only a Cult Classic but also Tom Hanks and Joe Dante at their best.The 'Burbs tells the story of Ray Peterson(Tom Hanks)a middle class Suburbanite who is on vacation from work. While on vacation,Ray begins to hear strange noises next door from his neighbors The Klopeks people who rarely come of their house. Now,Ray along with his other neighbors Mark Rumsfield(Bruce Dern)and Art Weingartner)want to investigate their mysterious neighbors and laughs and insanity ensues.Released in 1989,The 'Burbs was a great,hilarious Black Comedy that did modest business at the Box Office and received mixed reviews from movie critics and was basically ignored at the time when it was released in theaters but thankfully over the years The 'Burbs has gained an audience and wonderful Cult Following since it's release and is seen as the fantastic,underrated Comedy that it is. The 'Burbs is in my opinion of the funniest films ever made and is one of those movies where when you first see it or watch it for the first time on Home Video or Television you will love it immediately because every neighborhood has a tale about mysterious and quiet neighbor or neighbors and The Burbs puts it on the movie screen. From beginning to end The 'Burbs is a film that is filled with great laughs that are nonstop as well as hilarious and funny and the Comedy is surreal and demented,dark and twisted and at the same time quirky and offbeat with dialog and one-liners that are done with dry wit and over the top style. While the The 'Burbs is a Comedy director Joe Dante mixes in elements of other genres such as Horror,Mystery and Satire. The Horror and Mystery elements of the movie make the film and certain scenes eerie and Suspenseful where one minute you are laughing the next you are on the edge of your seat. I think that the mixture of those different genres gives the movie an atmosphere that is creepy and weird but also haunting and sinister in a truly nightmarish way with rain and noises but the atmosphere is done in a funny and stylish way that fits the strange and bizarre world of The 'Burbs The Satire is also one of the things that I love about The 'Burbs is the way the film mocks and makes a Satire of Suburban culture showing all the things often associated with the suburbs green glass that's clean,beautiful houses and concrete ground that is spotless and the suburbia in The 'Burbs seems perfect and flawless but underneath the perfect style of Suburbia there is something off and very wrong going on and the wrong things going on in The 'Burbs is done and told in a funny way. The character Ray Peterson is a great and funny character because he's just a regular guy that wants to rest and enjoy his vacation but when Ray and his neighbors investigate The Klopeks he gets himself into situations that are hilarious and over the top and with Ray and his neighbors Rumsfield and Art investigating The Klopeks you never know what's going to happen next. The screenplay by Dana Olsen is fantastic and well-written,with Olsen giving the main characters memorable dialog that is funny and clever and telling a great,off the wall story about Suburbia. The ending of The 'Burbs is laugh out loud funny and thrilling at the same time with laughs and surprises all around. The ending is a great conclusion to the film that will have viewers smiling.The whole cast is great. Tom Hanks is excellent,hilarious and at his best as Ray Peterson,with Hanks bringing laughs and energy to the role. Bruce Dern is amazing and funny as Lt. Mark Rumsfield,with Dern saying great one-liners. Carrie Fisher is wonderful as Carol Petersen,Ray's wife. Ray Ducommun is fantastic and a laugh riot as Art,Ray's neighbor and Ducommun has great scenes with Hanks. Corey Feldman is great and funny as Ricky,a observes everything and loves his street. Wendy Schaal is wonderful and sexy as Bonnie Rumsfield,Mark's wife. Henry Gibson(Dr. Werner Klopek)Brother Theodore(Uncle Reuben Klopek)and Courtney Gains(Hans Klopek)are terrific and quirky as The Klopeks. Gale Gordon(Walter),Dick Miller(Vic,Garbageman#1),Robert Picardo(Joe,Garbageman#2),Franklyn Ajaye(Detective#1),Rance Howard(Detective#2),Cory Danziger(Dave Peterson),Heather Hasse(Ricky's girlfriend)and Nicky Katt(Steve)give good performances as well.The direction by Joe Dante is brilliant and stylish,with Dante always moving the camera and using great angles,close-ups bringing a wonderful energy,pace and visual style. Fantastic direction,Dante.The score by Jerry Goldsmith is amazing,haunting and intense and truly matches the tone of the movie. I also love Goldsmith's homage to Ennio Morricone's Spagetti Western scores in one of the scenes. Great score,Goldsmith.In final word,if you love Tom Hanks,Joe Dante,Comedies,Black Comedies or genre films in general,I highly suggest you see The 'Burbs,an excellent,hilarious,underrated Black Comedy that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",The 'Burbs
90,TheMarwood,"Classic 80s comedy, even though it writes itself into a corner by the end",9,17 June 2014,"The 'burbs has a certain charm that wins me over on every viewing. Its mix of an Amblin Entertainment style suburb and innocent horror blend perfectly and the script is consistently clever, even though the end is never quite pulled off. When a bizarre family moves into the neighborhood, their middle of the night activities raise suspicions amongst a group of neighbors until their snooping leads them to believe these new neighbors might be murderers. Hanks, Dern and Ducommun make a great trio and their efforts in getting to the bottom of these nocturnal goings on are usually hilarious. The 'burbs has a premise that writes itself into a corner by the last few minutes. There's equal evidence these strange neighbors are psychos and also could be innocently misunderstood, so any resolution outside of leaving it to the viewer's imagination is bound to come across a contrived disappointment. But then again, if the script offered no resolution, the film would feel incomplete and the viewer would be robbed of an ending -- so, it's really impossible for this film not to be written into a corner and while the last few minutes fumble character motivation and logic, the preceding running time works effortlessly. It's my favorite work from Joe Dante.",The 'Burbs
91,Coffee_in_the_Clink,Very underrated,9,10 May 2020,"""The 'Burbs"" is a very underrated, quirky and hilarious comedy film with gothic-horror overtones, directed by Joe Dante of ""Piranha"" and ""Gremlins"" notoriety and starring Tom Hanks, Carrie Fisher, Bruce Dern, Rick Ducommun and Corey Feldman. There is a strong Tim Burton-esque look to the film, and centres around the inhabitants of your typical suburban cul-de-sac, and their reaction to a strange, Eastern European family that move in to a dilapidated house on the street. Tom Hanks plays Ray Peterson, a burnt-out man on a week's vacation from work. His wife (Carrie Fisher) wants him to make the most of it and go 'up to the lake' for the week with her and their son, but Ray just wants to lay around in his dressing gown, watch TV and drink with his next door neighbour and good friend Art, whose wife is away at the moment. Across the street there is young Ricky Butler (Feldman) whose parents are also not at home this week, so he throws parties and has his friends over, old man Walter is at the end of the cul-de-sac and has the best garden on the street, according to slightly unhinged Vietnam War vet Mark this is because he allows his dog to defecate on everyone else's front lawn every morning. Mark lives with his much younger and bimbo wife Bonnie. The new neighbours are right next door to Ray, and weird things are going on there. No one has seen them, but there are uncanny rumblings and lights flashing from the house at night, and when old man Walter goes missing, Ray, Art and Mark look to finally become acquainted with the new neighbours and find out what is going on behind their shuttered windows and locked doors...""The 'Burbs"" is not considered a classic and, on the contrary, is generally not well received, but for me, it has cult-status written all over it. I think the horror/comedy is blended very well together, and while Joe Dante paints the film to look very like Tim Burton's style, I think this only serves to add credit to the film. It's a laugh-a-minute and has a wonderful atmosphere. It hits all the right keys in portraying the typical suburban street and denizen; everything from the people who cut their grass every day while gawking and gossiping about their neighbours, to the cliques that are formed and the subsequent distrust and curiosity as soon as someone new moves in. It works as a social satire in this regard because in the wind up, Ray and his pals become the very thing that they claim to be afraid of behind their well-trimmed hedges and manicured lawns. The cast of characters are very likable and extremely quirky. The superb screenplay from Dana Olsen (who appears as a cop near the end) is full of great lines and plenty of madcap misadventure. This street is summed-up by an anonymous bin-man when he encounters Ray and the gang: ""I hate cul-de-sacs. There's only one way out, and the people are usually weird.""",The 'Burbs

93,ReelCheese,I Love This Movie,9,10 October 2006,"Originality can go a long way in movieland, as THE 'BURBS so perfectly illustrates. Tom Hanks is Ray Peterson, an average schmuck not sure what to do with his at-home vacation. He soon finds his excitement when he and his paranoid neighbors convince themselves the weirdos on the block are responsible for the strange disappearance of the neighborhood's beloved old man. So they do what any of us would do... break into their home to find proof of the dastardly deed.So many critics charged that Hanks tarnished his reputation with this effort. But for the umpteenth time, the critics were just being overly critical. THE 'BURBS is a hilarious, well-written and wonderfully creative piece of work. It's the kind of movie Joe Dante (GREMLINS, Matinée) does best. He takes a situation we can all basically relate to, turns it upside down and shakes the hell out of it like a snow globe.An unnecessarily heavy-handed ending is all that stands between THE 'BURBS and a 10-star rating. All of a sudden a fun little ride is derailed by an angry outburst and contrived syringe battle. If Dante had it to do over again, he surely would have come up with something more suitable (and humorous).Of course THE 'BURBS is not for all tastes, but if you like the pre-PHILADELPHIA Hanks and are in the mood for something completely different, you won't want to mi",The 'Burbs
94,heisenberg12,"Goofy '80s Comedy Classic, Weird but Entertaining",8,3 February 2021,"The Burbs has several major issues such as annoying and bad musical selection to accompany many of its scenes, and a couple of cringeworthy lines that are too cheesy. However, with that being said, most of it works.This is an unforgettable dark comedy that earns many rewatches whenever it's on if you are on vacation and just looking for some pure entertainment. Before Hanks rose to dramatic stardom, he was mostly a comedy actor in the 80s, and as usual, he draws the laughs along with Bruce Dern, who really steals the movie as a whacky retired army ranger who pursues the case of investigating his new suspected satanic neighbors like a mission in a war. Dern sets up communication bases, dresses in camouflage, pulls out infrared telescopes, and climbs onto his roof with a rifle while participating in Hanks' and his friend's paranoid escapades in the neighborhood.Although I recommend this movie, it is not for everyone; if you are expecting any kind of artistic depth or any kind of challenging worldly material here, you surely will be disappointed, and some more highbrow viewers would possibly shut it off when the cheesiness kicks in. However, if you just want to be entertained, have some cheap laughs, and be absorbed into an interesting dark comedy for a couple of hours, then the Burbs just might do the trick.8/10",The 'Burbs
95,David_Frames,HANKS a million,8,11 January 2006,"You may remember an excellent comic actor called Tom Hanks who was brutally and callously murdered in 1992 by Tom Hanks: character actor and James Stewartophile. The crime shocked the world and provided a none too subtle acknowledgement that Hanks the serious actor didn't value his comedic counterpart's abilities. In effect he was saying 'look, I take myself far too seriously to contemplate being remembered as just another comedian - I want gravitas, respect from my peers, er, Oscars. Oscars? Any chance do you think?' Unbelievably there was. Playing everything from AIDS victims to the retarded and lets not forget a gangster(!) Hanks proved that Hollywood does indeed reward its own for worthy performances, just a pity that the audience is an afterthought. Hanks is not a great serious actor. His name says dependable but never exciting. One thing he was good at was comedy, in fact as the everyman who gets dropped into the most unlikely situations he had an unbeatable niche which unfortunately for us he tired of sometime in 1991. Nowadays Hanks looks back on comedies like 'the 'burbs' with a faint wisp of embarrassment - the way you and I might look at Baby photos of ourselves. In a telling interview circa 1999 with Mark Cousins on the BBC's scene by scene, in which actors talk about their movies while looking at clips, he gave the game away by describing the burbs sarcastically as 'a great film'. Too bad - because Dante's divine comedy (do you see what I've done there?) is great and worth 4 Philidelphias or approximately 15.3 Forrest Gumps at the current rate of exchange.Its smart, witty stuff - notable for its clever references, particularly the nod to once upon a time in the west and anchored as ever, by Hanks' everyman, gradually losing his grip in the midst of an escalation of disturbing circumstances.

Cory Feldman also does great with his small but important role in this film.  As for Tom Hanks, he does great with the part that is given him.  It definitely wasn't award winning but sometimes you have to do the ""fun"" film.  I also loved how the movie played with people's paranoia.  It shows just how far people will go if they listen to rumors instead of trying to find out things for themselves in a normal manner.All in all this film is funny and probably one of the great 80's film.

The plot on paper seems very interesting, but they just do nothing with it!. 3 quarters of the movie is literally just dialog with nothing interesting except them trying to make jokes and saying ""somethings odd about those neighbors"" then finally it becomes really interesting the last quarter which ultimately earned this a 5 star instead of a 3.Summary:

Actually it reminded me of Dantes TV series ""Eerie, Indiana"" anyone remember that? Anyway the burbs is well worth checking out, Tom Hanks is as good as ever and Bruce Dern is brilliant as a nutty ex-soldier. One other person commented here that he pictured Dan Ackroyd playing the role of Art, strangely enough I though it would have been great if John Candy played the part as he and Tom Hanks made a great team. Although the actor who played the part of Art did a perfectly fine job. Nice to see Corey Feldman in a decent movie for what was probably the last time, he was a really promising actor at one point, check out his performance in Stand by Me for proof.

Still, it's not as funny as I was expecting, not that it's a dull film. Quite the opposite, it is great entertainment and contains a great performance from Tom Hanks, one that is far from the post 'Forrest Gump' Hanks we now see.

107,kdavies-69347,A Slightly Dark Romp Through Suburbia,6,15 April 2016,"The 'Burbs were one of those semi-clean comedies that my mother and father approved of in our VHS library when I was a child. Directed by Joe Dante (of Gremlins fame), and featuring some of the biggest names from the 1980's, it's a movie that still is still hilarious from a somewhat gentler political time.Tom Hanks and Carrie Fisher play the central family unit during a weekend holiday, representing the ideal American family living somewhere in unknown suburbia. Every neighbour plays a wonderful caricature of the typical melting pot that makes the U.S such a weird and wonderful place to live. There is a retired war veteran (Bruce Dern), and his beautiful young wife (Wendy Schaal) ready to play taps and raise the American flag every morning. The young rock and roller (Corey Feldman), left home alone for the weekend with a few chores to do around the house, but will spend the majority of this weekend drinking beer and running amok. And the 'everyman' neighbour Art (Rick Ducommun) who plays the instigating and downright rude best friend to the main character. Each one brings a different persona to this crazy little neighbourhood, and they blend well together.The plot revolves around a family of recluses, the Klopek family, who rumour has it are mentally disturbed, extremely secretive, maybe even homicidal. Every neighbour has a different story to tell about them, and following a night of a massive power outage, the rumours spread quickly. Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks) becomes quickly paranoid and the neighbours become more and more aggressive when it comes to finding out what's going on in the Klopek's house. It doesn't take long before a few of the more suspicious neighbours decide to sneak into their home and finally figure what's going on in their dilapidated home.A comedy from a different generation, where breaking and entering was considered a petty crime. It's a fun romp through an a-typical U.S suburb, and even slightly dark at times. A definite classic in 80's comedy, before Tom Hanks entered the more dramatic era of his career.6/10",The 'Burbs

It has an incredibly lame story, good actors (like Hanks, Bruce Dern, and Carrie Fisher) who are wasted, and who look embarassed to be there, and a plot that goes nowhere. Thank goodness Hanks has moved on from this and become one of the best American actors today. While watching this on tape, I found myself fast forwarding through the movie just to get to a scene with any substance.  I'm just glad I didn't have to see it in a theater.

But the strange family that lives next door make him and his other neighbors highly suspicious, and then plain paranoid.Don't be fooled by the poster picture, which shows only Tom Hanks. His character is very restrained, and he does a good job. But Bruce Dern and Rick Ducommun as Rays neighbors definitely steal the show here, with the first delivering great one-liners while Rick is hilarious in his ADD paranoid portrayal of Art. Corey Feldman is here as well, and his presence is an instantaneous flashback to the 80s, which was refreshing given the movie sometimes dark settings.The beauty of this film lies on its unpredictability on a first viewing, and hilariosity in repeated ones. There are so many good one-liners, shots, and unexpected things that makes you want to revisit the movies universe.Joe Dante directed this piece, and it shows. The plot is focused on the quirks and behavior of the neighbors, and in particular the characterization, its a simple thing so well done, that at the end of the film I felt like I knew the surroundings just as well as them.What can I say?

A great supporting cast also includes Bruce Dern playing the military obsessed Rumsfield and Rick Ducommun (The dad from scary movie) playing Hanks's even more obsessive neighbour. The story is about Hanks starting to realise that his new neighbours might be murderers. The family Klopeck who are weird start getting to Hanks and Hanks becomes obsessed with finding the truth. There is no toilet humour in this movie. Some may wonder if its good or bad. The acting is great and the slapstick falling from roofs and fences by Ducommun and Dern make it even funnier. At first I didn't know Joe Dante directed this but then I spotted...... SPOILERS?I spotted...Dick Miller and Robert Picardo playing garbagemen. The music is the same in all of Dante's movies.

112,audrablum,"Funny, Silly, Memorable Film",9,11 March 2018,"This week I watched The Burbs (1989). In spite of the fact that I had never heard of it, I really enjoyed the film. It was interesting and full of quirky components and characters that had me wondering what would happen next. I liked that film felt very 90s sitcom turned comedic thriller. I also liked the film for its relatable components (the my neighbors are all weirdos factor) as well as the originality of the plot. I don't think I have ever seen another movie take this approach to the ""what are my neighbors really doing?"" theme. This film made me feel inspired to write my own work and to direct something comedic. The editing is an interesting topic of discussion here as the hallmark of a good editor is that you don't notice their work. That being said I think the editing was good. I feel like the shooting style combined with the editing is what gave this film the 90s sitcom turned comedic thriller. The film editing gave the film a lot of life as there was definite ebbs and flows in the pacing. During moments where we needed to feel like there was danger the editing held longer shots that gave the viewer ample time to ask questions like ""what did they find?"" ""What's around the corner"" or ""What does this mean?"" While the comedic sections of the film generally didn't hold shots quite as long and only really gave time for the viewer to laugh before hitting the viewer with a comedic line of dialogue. Overall, I enjoyed the film and would recommend it for anyone looking for something in the comedy, mystery, thriller genre.",The 'Burbs
113,shadow_blade-89459,Good Dark Comedy,6,9 March 2018,"""The 'Burbs"" (1989) is a comedic mystery thriller about a typical suburban neighborhood where something is off about the new neighbors. The film is from the perspective of Ray Peterson, played by Tom Hanks, as he tries to enjoy his time off and deescalate the neighborhood snoops, Mark and Art played by Bruce Dern and Rick Ducommun respectively. I love Tom Hanks, but I am not a fan of this film. The film is put together well, but the character of Art was extremely annoying to me and really turned me off the film. The editing and pacing flowed well with the story. However, the film is solid for the late 80s.The director, Joe Dante, stayed true to his horror comedy style where most of the comedy isn't in your face like ""Gremlins,"" which I loved. He effortlessly snuck in little bits of comedy without completely taking away from the mystery, thriller concept. I was initially unsure of the point of this film, but the reason is there are two. Don't be a nosy neighbor and revealing the second which equates to the payoff would spoil the film. Overall, this film is solid and if you can ignore Art, you may be able to enjoy it.",The 'Burbs

As much as I enjoyed those, it was The 'Burbs that became my go to film for many years and still is.Hanks plays Ray, a suburban dad who is on a short vacation and just wants to sit back, drink beer, smoke a cigar and watch the game while his wife (Carrie Fisher) and son, go a see relatives. But as soon as he tries to relax it becomes very clear that his new neighbours, The Klopeks, are a strange breed. It also doesn't help that his friends Art (Ducommon) and Rumsfield (Dern) increase the paranoia with their conspiracy theories and wild accusations. But with more and more strange happenings occurring around the neighbourhood Ray can't help but get drawn in and investigate himself.This film is dark and funny and perfect for basically all ages. It can be lightly terrifying and a little mature in some very small aspects but it is very comedic and good natured in a way that makes it a must see. They really don't make them like this any more and because Joe Dante (Gremelins) was at the helm you can be sure that what your getting is quality.",The 'Burbs
115,anchoreddown,What's wrong with this movie????,8,5 June 2009,Definaltely Tom Hanks at his best! Not sure why this movie isn't part of any 'top' list because I think it deserves it. This film somehow is believable to me. It's a neighborhood much like any other with neighbors who may act and look like misfits. I'm sure every street has one. I actually have nicknamed the misfits on our street the 'Klopecks' after the the ones in the film. It toys with the concept that you are never to sure who your neighbor really is. They could be murderers for all you know. This is what sets the tone of the film and it was actually used as well when Robert Bloch wrote the original Psycho novel. Much of the humor develops from the male adults who basically are acting like curious kids. It's not terribly graphic or anything super scary and can be welcomed by kids who don't get scared that easily.,The 'Burbs

Its a dark little comedy about the every man Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks) who is wondering what is going on at his new next door neighbour's house. But after two of his whacked out neighbours both wonderfully played by Bruce Dern as Mark Rumsfield and Rick Ducommun as Art Weingartner lead Hanks to believe that something very dark and mysterious is going on over at the Klopek's house. Things start to really get going when their neighbour Walter goes missing.I can't describe it, but to me Hanks brings something to this film that many other actors who if were in the same role he plays would not be able to bring. I mean yes he's silly, but he's also a bit of reasonable character when put with Art and Rumsfield.The music by Jerry Goldsmith is also great! It meshes perfectly with what Dante is bringing to the screen. They both bring fun and excitement to the viewer.Ron Howard acts as executive producer. Also starring Carrie Fisher as Ray's wife Carol, Corey Feldman as teenage neighbour Ricky, Henry Gibson as Dr. Klopek and Dick Miler and Robert Picardo as garbage men.If you like dark comedies I would say give this Joe Dante film a try.

Only mildly funny ""The 'burbs"" seems to run out of fuel before it ever gets started. I am a huge Tom Hanks fan, but I could not sit through this film again. It is worth seeing at least once, but I think you'll agree once is enough.The story is about a new family that moves into an all American suburb.

118,Zoopansick,My favorite movie of all time!,10,30 May 2002,"The Burbs' is without a doubt my favorite movie of all time.  Not to say that it is the best movie of all time, but rather my favorite.  I am often skeptical when someone says that their favorite movie of all time is something like the painfully overrated Shawshank Redemption, or a true classic like Citizen Kane, The Godfather, or even contemporary best picture winners like A Beautiful Mind or Forrest Gump.  I think that while some (and I do stress SOME) or these movies have more accomplished casts, a better plot, and in some cases revolutionary filmmaking, they aren't really people's favorites.  They aren't movies like the Burbs' which one can watch time and time again and continue to laugh or think of past times watching the movie.  They aren't movies that one is likely to watch every two months or so, or sit down and watch them at 3:00 AM if they happen to be on.  The movies that people watch at 3:00 AM are movies like The Burbs'.  These movies are funny, hold sentimental value to the watcher, and are easy to watch over and over again.Now onto precisely why I like The Burbs' soooo much.  First and foremost it is a funny movie.  The characters, especially Bruce Dern's are all quirky and deliver some good lines.  For example when Bruce says, ""There go the god damn brownies!"" after he part of the Klopeks porch collapses, it makes me laugh...hard.  It's in his delivery.  Like I previously mentioned sentimentality also plays a big role.  I have fond memories watching this throughout my childhood and now into college.  I lived in the suburbs all my lives and find some of the characters though somewhat cookie cutter images, to be accurate.  I really like the Corey Feldman character, and every time I go outside to do yard work, or paint the house (like he does), I pan the block and hear that song in my head (I don't know the name, but the heavy metal one he puts on that goes ""I am your war machine...."").  Tom Hanks is great in this movie also and some of the stuff he says like ""I believe a man's furnace is his own business."", is priceless.  My Justin and I like to fill our conversations with Burbs lines.  He particularly likes the lines offered by the grizzled uncle Reuben; even his harsh ""No."" is a favorite.No, this movie isn't going to win alot of awards or be held in high regard in most circles, but it should be.  Just the way the characters interact with each other is funny.  The Burbs has a certain charm about it that allows me to keep watching it over and over.  It doesn't rely on gags that may make the viewer howl with laughter the first time they see it but fade with future viewings.  Instead it relies on funny lines delivered Hanks' funniest outing.  For God's sake this is a Corey Feldman movie that is good! While some of you are bound to disagree that this movie is very funny, I kind of like it that way.  I like that the Burbs is kind of developing a cult following (not a really big one, but big enough that I run into people that really like it).  I like that this movie has it's own little audience.

121,mrtimlarabee,Light dark comedy,7,31 March 2008,"The 'burbs is a fun diversion from the usual neighborhood comedies. Joe Dante has a way of combining dark humor and outright horror and make it convincing to a mass audience (see 'Gremlins.') That this film has a lot of dark elements and remains just a light romp at the end is a feat unto itself. All credit goes to Hanks' good natured comedic performance and Dante's fun with the material.Dante paints a portrait of the neighborhood at the very beginning. Hanks plays Ray, probably the most normal among the neighbors. Art is like a big kid and the first one to suspect the neighbors of foul play. Bruce Dern plays a war vet where Ricky Butler, played by Corey Feldman is the loud teenager. All is well in suburbia until clues pop up that might reveal the new neighbors, the Klopeks, as murderers.With any other talent behind the film, this could have been a very dark comedy. But instead of playing up the horror, Dante has fun with it, playing up the comedy talents of his performers (notably Hanks and Dern, who take turns chewing scenery). Dante also has fun with visuals, notably in a hilarious dream sequence that Ray has.Everything comes together to make this film work, including a great score by Jerry Goldsmith, that is part suburban comedy and part horror, complete with organs culled from a funeral march.

122,smithpaulusmc,Love Thy Neighbor,5,11 March 2019,"Tom Hanks is a household favorite. He is a stone-faced, humourous legend best known for his success in Big, Forrest Gump, Castaway, and You've Got Mail. Hanks' greatest talent is his familiarity. His characters feel like our kind older brother or a genuine reflection of ourselves. He makes any screenplay a hit. But that is not true for the 1989 horror-comedy The 'Burbs.The 'Burbs presents itself as a blend of Plains, Trains, and Automobiles' buddy humor and a calmer version of American Pie. It tells the story of a quiet suburban cul-de-sac whose newest residents are quite peculiar. Fearing the unknown about the newcomers' intentions, the legacy tenants launch an overzealous investigation to prove their fears are justified. Nearly every character, from the local teanager to the Vietnam veteran, is an unbelievable caricature. Tom Hanks alone offers a real performance as a disaffected father who carefully balances household obligations with personal sanity.There are several times the film lacks motivation and seems to drag on just long enough for an exciting incident to shock its heart back into action. From the script's perspective, there is no real structure and the characters have no real goal. The only real saving grace and delightful moments arrive in the form of slapstick conundrums and comedic aversion to Art Weingarter's (Rick Ducommun) eating habits.To be fair, the movie blends in with a majority of 80's American comedies. There is no real lesson learned or major takeaway. It is a farce of a universe where our own abnormalities and presuppositions can be tested and understood. For these reasons and a refreshing splash of Tom Hanks, The 'Burbs is tolerable. In all, the film oversteps its perceived genre and caters poorly to a large audience rather than treating a smaller group to genuine story.",The 'Burbs

The three suspect them as murderers as they begin discovering more and more ""clues"" about the Klopeck's, until Ray is finally pushed over the edge and they decide to clean out the Klopeck's once and for all.Full of wit, humor, and genuinely creepy thrills that will send shivers up your spine, The 'Burbs creates its own unique mix and in the end, is able to pull off the perfect balance of its scary moments and humorous ones. Some of the jokes do misfire but the script is loaded with them, so you'll be laughing at least every 2 minutes. Each character does great in their role (espcially Tom Hanks), although Rick Duco...something does nothing more than average job in his hilarious role.The showdown at the end is excellent, the truth behind the veil of the Klopeck's mysteries is lifted and is probably the best scene in the whole film (although the the scene where they visit the Klopecks is a close second), and in the end you are just...smiling.So while The 'Burbs is nowhere near perfect (some of the scary moments are far too scary, the story is usually at a standstill and a handful of the jokes can misfire), the 'Burbs is a wonderful film that you will want to watch over and over just as I have. And you will never get tired of it. 7.9/10.",The 'Burbs
134,mockfilmreviews,Makes you miss funny Tom Hanks.,8,24 January 2016,"Alright kids, time to jump into the Wayback Machine and watch a blast from the past. We are going back to a time before Tom Hanks was only seen as Oscar gold and wasn't afraid to go for the gut laugh. If you don't know of this time that I speak then ask your dad and watch this weeks slice of late eighties fun called The 'Burbs. This film is reminiscent of so many films of that time. Weird, off the wall flicks that seem like a stoner fantasy but for some reason, the kismet was there and they work. They shouldn't, but they do.Driected by Joe Dante (Oh, you know we are going to visit the Gremlins, both 1 and 2, at a later date), The 'Burbs takes all of the old tropes of nosy neighbors and builds a slapstick horror around it. Ray Peterson (Hanks) is off from work and becomes obsessed with the strange new neighbors, the Klopecks, with a fair amount of goading from his friends (played hilariously by Rick Ducommun and Mock Films Blog alum Bruce Dern). With little or nothing to do with their free time, the three buddies spy on the eccentric activities of the new residents, like digging up their own yard in the dead of night or the odd noises emanating from their basement. As the strange behavior continues next door, one of the members of the block disappears mysteriously, adding to the speculation from Ray and his cohorts that the Klopecks may be a family of serial killers. What follows is a well crafted, keep you guessing mystery which brings genuine laughs to the audience.—",The 'Burbs

The reason why I gave it a 6, is just because the movie feels quite old when you watch it. I don't really blame the mannerisms of the actors, but the camera work and editing might get you almost to the point of cringing and wondering wether it's a real movie or a parody of a comedy movie itself. E.g. The Goosebumps TV series had a soother camera work/editing.
The concept behind the movie is also quite cool, and the movie is in many ways still a classic (watch it with your family!).",The 'Burbs

Having watched the film over and over, I seem to appreciate more each time, it is very engrossing. Despite the ravaging the critics gave it on it's release, I thoroughly recommend you watch this film if ever you get the opportunity and record it for repeated viewing.""The 'Burbs"" is set in the small suburb Hinkley Hills, a close-knit community consisting of various people with very different characteristics to one another.  Tom Hanks (""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Forrest Gump"") plays down-to-earth Ray Peterson who is becoming rather suspicious of his knew next-door neighbours, the mysterious and seldom seen Klopek's.  After hearing strange noises coming from the Klopek's basement in the dead of night, other neighbours begin to sense that something is not quite right. Larger-than-life (literally) Art Weingartner (played by Rick Ducommun -""Groundhog Day""), Mark Rumsfield (Bruce Dern -""Small Soldiers"") and young Ricky Butler (Corey Feldman - ""The Goonies"", ""Stand By Me"") all convince Ray to help them in their under-handed investigations into what exactly is going on at the Klopek residence.The film is hilarious from start to finish (Dern and Ducommun deserve special praise for their comedic performances) and there is some inspired direction from Joe Dante (""Gremlins"", ""Small Soldiers"") and the mood is established perfectly with a cracking score, ""The 'Burbs"" gets 10 out of 10 from me and is one of the best - if not THE best film of the '80's.

141,Idolprincess,Evil Neighbors 129392,7,13 July 2004,"Another 80's neighbor movie! Great. Before starting this review, I have to say that I don't know what could have possessed the people who classified this movie as horror. This is an 80's comedy, and a typical one. I have a weak spot for movies like this one, because they're so silly, so maybe I'm too biased to write this review, but I'll give it a shot anyway.This definitely isn't the funniest comedy. This isn't even the funniest 80's comedy, or even the funniest 80's neighbor-related comedy. But it was funny, and it has a formula that works, or at least that worked back in the 1980's. Many goofy suburbans trying to figure out what type of strange neighbors have moved in last month, suspecting them of murdering another of their neighbors? Sounds good to me!I have to admit that this movie has it's dull moments, but there's extremely silly moments too. Tom Hanks is really funny in this, I thought. This was maybe his last goofy light-hearted movie before appearing in more serious movies like ""Forrest Gump"" or ""Saving private Ryan"" in the 90's. Some of the characters in this are so typical of 80's movie. By example, the sexy bubble-headed neighbor who's always half dressed and always nice to everyone and the annoying typical teenager played, of course, by Corey Feldman.
This really isn't a movie for everyone. Most people would find it stupid and unfunny, but if you're not difficult and you like the 80's, you'll like it. Also, it doesn't rely on exploitation or sex jokes to make it interesting. A good movie to watch if you're stuck at home on a rainy day.",The 'Burbs

144,Critic-46,'Burbs Review - from Average Man Critic,10,13 August 1999,"Story -1. Three nosey guys; one possible dead old guy; half naked ladies; bodies in the backyard; a home furnace set to 1000 degrees; dogs the size of horses; a very nice explosion scene and neighbors from hell... welcome to the wonderful world of the 'Burbs.Characters -1. Characters any person can relate to. Lets see... I'm more of a Ray Petterson - the wackos are livin' right next door to me, I want to do something about it, but its not my style. Art - a compulsive overeater who is fully convinced that the neighbors are up to something. Rumsfield - ex-marine and arms dealer, he also feels that the neighbors are up to something and is ready to set up high tech surveillance to prove it. Ricky Butler - your typical teenager who goes around making up stories about the neighbors. He is dying for something to happen because his own life is boring and pointless. Carrol and Bonnie - your typical wives who feel the guys are crazy and should mind their own business. The Klopecks - homicidal maniacs or merely doctors who have strange tendencies? You have to see the movie to find out.Acting -1. Tom Hanks, Carrie Fisher, Corey Fieldman, and the rest of the cast were perfect and played their parts without a hitch.Cinematography -1. The ""House"" was spooky and sinister. And even though the film never left the Cul-de-sac, not for a momemnt did it get boring. Everything was so beautifully done you hardly noticed it.Beginning -1. The opening scene, with Ray standing in front of the ""House"" where a loud irritating noise is coming from the basement with the spooky music playing in the background, sets the mood for the movie and instantly intrigues its viewer.End -1. A twist with a twist... pure genius. Nice explosion too.Believability -1. All homicidal maniacs have neighbors... in this particular film, the neighbors decided to do something about it. Could happen.Attention Holding- 1. 'Burbs like other great films, has a quality not many other films possess- the ability to hypnotize the viewer and not make him/here move from the seat or even blink. I love it.Memorable -1. Absolutely. Burbs is a film you won't soon forget. Especially the Klopecks and Rumsfield falling off the roof with a loaded gun and Ray blowing up the house or Art eating five breakfasts and wanting more or when the three guys are going through the garbage truck in broad day light or... get the picture?Could Watch Again -1. I own it on DVD and VHS and I watch the film at least once a week if not more. Also to any 'Burbs fan... the DVD contains the Alternate Ending.'Burbs = 10+. One of my all time favorite movies. No excessive violence or vulgar language, just good clean fun, cooky characters and a perfect script. I never get tired of this one.",The 'Burbs

When the Klopecs move into a quiet neighborhood in the suburbs, strange occurences take place that lead a group of friends to suspect their new neighbors are up to no good.Characters -1.  I love seeing movies about crazy people and 'Burbs has just about the craziest group of people I have seen on film.  Ray Peterson - a quiet man who chose the wrong week to stay home.  His idea of fun is sitting at home and watching the ballgame, but because of his friends he won't have any time to relax.  Art Weingartener - a nosey overeater that is fully convinced that the new neighbors are up to no good.  The only problem is that he is too chicken and too lazy to do anything about it alone.  Mr. Rumsfield - ex marine, who also feels that the Klopecs are evil.  He is the take charge on, ready to set up high tech survailance to prove he is right.Acting -1.  Tom Hanks gives the performance is his career.  Personally in his recent movies, he has played straight forward characters that showed his dramatic capabilities.  In the 'Burbs it shows that he has a cooky and comic side and its absolutely hillarious.Cinematography -1.  Though the set designs were quite basic and the film never left the cul-de-sac, I was always intrigued by the location and I never grew bored of it.  The explosion scene was well done and the camera angles were perfect.Beginning -1.  It was funny how the characters were introduced to us; we see Ray standing outside before sunrise in his pajamas listening to an annoying sound from the House next door.  Rumsfield is the patriot.  He step out in leather vest, army boots and sunglasses with the American Flag in his hand, then he steps in a big pile of dog poop and looses his mind.  Art is seen with a gun trying to kill a crow, but nearly blows Ray's head off in the process.End -1.  Excellent.  A great blend of suspence, action, comedy and drama.Attention Holding -1.  Like any great film does, 'Burbs has the power to hypnotize the viewer.  You won't want to blink... trust me.Memorable -1.  Every aspect of this movie is memorable.  The characters, the old house, and especially the end.Could Watch Again -1.  I watch this one almost every night before I go to bed and I always laugh at the same jokes.  It's timeless.Full package -1.  'Burbs is perfect.'Burbs = 10+.  If you love silly movies and appreciate great writing and excellent filmmaking then you should definetly enjoy this movie.  I have it on DVD and the alternate ending is one of the special features, it was cool to see, but the ending which they went with was much better.",The 'Burbs

It is seriously underrated movie, a little dark and strange, but very funny and containing a great cast. Tom Hanks delivers a convincing performance as the normal guy, next to all his strange and quirky neighbours, especially the murderers next door. Everyone is cast brilliantly. It is a clever film that keeps you guessing the first time you see it, you wonder if the neighbours really are murderers or if it really is all just crazy nonsense, and when you find out the truth you actually are a little surprised because the film does a good job of showing, not telling. Underrated but that is one of the reasons I love it, not a huge blockbuster but a quiet, under-the-radar kind of film that, if you're lucky enough to spot it, gives you lots of laughs and a couple of goosebumps too.

149,smiths-4,One of my all time favourites,10,16 December 2002,"I am 17 and I first saw this film about 10 years ago and i still find it the most quotable movie ever. I know it isn't the best film, but for pure enjoyment this one wins everytime(in my opinion). I love Joe Dante's movies because they are funny, low budget, weird and use the greatest character/b-movie actors since Roger Cormen(whom Dante worked for). My favourites in this movies are Dick Miller, Brother Theodore, Henry Gibson, Bruce Dern and Corey Feldmen. If you have seen the movie you'll know what parts they play (all equally funny). Add to this a youngish Tom Hanks, Rick Ducommun (when he had a career, before a bit part in Groundhog Day), Carrie Fisher (post Star Wars drug addiction) and Wendy Schaal (who i recently saw in Dantes Small Soldiers and the awesome Six Feet Under series) and you have a cast to match the best b-movie and then some!!! It makes references to many things not least b-movie horror, winnie the pooh(bee scene), the exorcist, suburban America and neighbours from hell. Standout scenes being the beginning starting from the universal logo (you know what i refer to), Bruce Dern going mad about dog poo, Bruce Dern falling of his own roof and shooting his own car window setting the alarm off and the wicked finale (citizens arrest!!!)

150,thelastjedi_good,"The plot of ""Rear Window"" and the campiness of ""Arsenic and Old Lace,"" makes for a hilarious romp",9,23 November 2016,"This is a silly movie that fits the Halloween season perfectly. It's shocking to me that critics and filmgoers hold this movie in somewhat low esteem.""The 'Burbs"" tells the story of Mayfield Place, a (usually) quiet cul-de-sac in a suburban town. Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks) is on a week-long ""staycation"" in his house, and he wants to meet his new neighbors, the Klopeks. Through a spooky series of events, Ray begins to suspect the Klopeks of killing a man who lives across the street. Ray and an entourage of goofy neighbors begin to investigate the suspected murder, and hijinks ensue.This movie is a cartoon. All of the characters are silly archetypes, and the setting is an overly colorful suburban cul-de-sac. The setting looks like a cheap Hollywood set, and that's by design. There is no realism in this movie. Like I said in the title, this film feels a lot like Capra's classic spooky comedy ""Arsenic and Old Lace."" This cartoonish, colorful feel is not a shortcoming at all- it's the perfect tone for the story Dante wants to tell. The laughs are consistent throughout.The comedy takes center stage, but the mystery in this movie is actually pretty clever in its own right. As the neighbor team uncovers clues about the murder, the audience tries to piece everything together at the same time. This is not a complex mystery that will leave you thinking weeks later, but it fits in this movie, and it helps keep the audience engaged from start to finish.This movie's central message is predictable: are the Klopeks the villains? Or are the true villains our nosy protagonists? The commentary is light, but it fits this movie, and it's something that everyone who has lived in suburbia can relate to.At the end of the day, this movie isn't a great artistic achievement.

153,tbuchalski,"The 'Burbs: My Good, Bad, and Ugly",8,22 July 2019,"The Good:
This film presents a late 20th century critique of the Treaty of Paris, wherein Germany, among others, was required to demobilize and disarm, and take responsibility for the losses from World War I. In the film three suburban American families suspect their new neighbors, perhaps Slavic immigrants, of foul play. The three patriarchs of the American families played by Hanks, Dern, and Ducommun can be interpreted as the three major players from the Allied Powers in the peace negotiations - France, The UK, and the US. And, the Klopeks with the repeated references to their Slavic roots can be seen clearly in opposition as Germany and other Slavic nations that helped make up the Central Powers. Hanks & Company are intensely nervous about what their neighbors are up to pointing to Germany's militarization in the years between World Wars I and II. Furthermore the subtly Jewish surnames of Hanks & company point at an historic hindsight wherein global tragedy might have been avoided if the Allies had focused less on punishment, and more on a continued peace. After all, some of the greatest physical pains of the film are inflicted on Hanks, the tacit leader of the neighborhood, when the film is over. It's this new interpretation of the film that adds to the layers of its value after 30 years.The Bad:
There is little narratively to support the behavior of Hanks and his neighbors. And, there is more here to be explored in gender relations and equality that is left on the table as the wives in the film, played by Carrie Fisher and Wendy Schaal, try to insist that their husbands not let their paranoia get the best of them. So, even as their attitudes are more rational and cool-headed, they are still found to be incorrect. There is almost an insistence that the more illogical choice must be the right one, and that fear-driven paranoia is the best course regardless of the pain and suffering it will inevitably cause. This film is ultimately a fun romp and an 80's comedy classic, but outside of the obscure yet interesting interpretations related to xenophobia and The Treaty of Versailles that I've introduced above, there's little else that sets this film apart.The Ugly:
No other film presents the critiques of suburban American paranoia quite like this film, but there are a few that did it differently, and arguably better. Disturbia (D.J. Caruso, 2007) is a more exciting presentation of the subject matter because it ascribes to the tropes and conventions of a thriller genre film. With a little comic relief from LaBeouf as was trademark for his films of the time his suspicion turned to paranoia turned to fear and panic takes the driver's seat in this film as the stakes double down as each act comes and goes. Similar suspense is intentionally avoided given the comic nature of The 'Burbs, so greater and more exciting elements of the story are muted and opaque.",The 'Burbs
154,JKazoo,Poor Casting Choices Ruin Great Idea,4,10 July 2008,"I really wanted to like ""The 'Burbs"". I really, really did. But the choices of the ""normal"" neighbors ruined any fun I may have had with it. Don't misunderstand me. I loved Henry Gibson, and you shouldn't be able to go wrong when you have Brother Theodore in your movie. But Tom Hanks, I'm sorry, is not a good actor, and despite what many of you may say, an Oscar does not exclude someone from such criticism. He's simply exceedingly mediocre, and casting him as a mediocre person does not help matters. Steve Buscemi, as evidenced by the movie ""The Big Lebowski"", would of made a much better choice in terms of making a dull person interesting. Corey Feldman, well, I just don't like him. He hasn't made a good movie since ""The Lost Boys"", and even that one's up for debate. His part seemed to of been as a sort of narrator, then the script got changed after he signed up. In other words, his part was really unnecessary, get rid of him. But most of my rage goes toward Rick Ducommen, who plays the ""annoying"" neighbor. Now some people, Randy Quaid for example, can make an annoying character likable. Ducommen's portrayal is simply annoying for the sake of being annoying, and I find myself using the mute button a lot when he's on screen. That said, I enjoyed most of the characters otherwise, especially the Klopeks themselves, but they receive so little screen time, and a majority of the movie was spent hanging out with these people I did not want to hang out with. Now, perhaps this was the point of the movie, that suburbia makes you dull and have to hang out with people you don't like, but that doesn't give the filmmakers the right to both bore and annoy me with it. The production design is also top-notch, but a pretty piece of crap is still a piece of crap. All in all, I recommend you FFWd 50 minutes, when we finally join the Klopeks, and keep the FFWd button handy for when they're not on screen from then on.",The 'Burbs

Hanks is Ray Peterson who just got few weeks of vacation and instead of leaving his small town, decides to stay at home for timeless relaxation. But his plans are interrupted as strange things start to happen in his neighborhood. The Burbs can be described as suspenseful sitcom, as some thrilling episodes go together with sudden laughs.

158,beedebee,an overlooked gem,10,17 September 2001,"Joe Dante always had a keen eye on American suburban life and popular culture and it truly shows in The 'Burbs, his 1989 effort, starring Tom Hanks.Basically it's the story of a bunch of neighbors, living in a cul-de-sac of an unnamed city, somewhere in the Midwest, that go absolutely paranoid when the slightly eccentric Klopeks move in next door. See, the Klopeks never go outside, don't socialize and strange sounds emanate from their cellar in the dead of night. And one day, old Walter has disappeared, his hairpiece left as evidence of the crime.So what else is there to do for bored Tom Hanks, the fairly reasonable central character, chubby pal Art, who's wife has gone for the week and Vietnam vet Bruce Dern, who's just looking for an excuse to relive the good old days, but to investigate. Fueled by Art's speculations and following a disastrous soiree with the Klopeks, Hanks decides to take matters into his own hands and make the neighborhood the safe haven it once was.The result is a quirky, light-weighted comedy with good all-round performances from the cast, some great lines, but it's the tone of the movie that I like best.

160,TheRagingBull94,Dark And Delightful. The 'Burbs Is Classic Tom Hanks and Joe Dante,9,17 October 2011,"I'm not completely familiar with the films of Joe Dante. I've watched Gremlins which is an absolute classic and I'm looking forward to seeing The Howling. The 'Burbs is one of his films and I don't think I can say anything less than that it was a really fun movie that had some witty yet dark humor, a wonderful 80s feel, an expectedly brilliant performance by Tom Hanks and an engaging mystery. On top of that, I've detected a lot of influence from classic thrillers from Alfred Hitchcock, notably Rear Window and Psycho as well as slight resemblances to To Kill A Mockingbird.The story is set in a neighborhood like any other. Ray Peterson is off from work and doesn't have anything to do on his vacation other than to walk around in his pyjamas all day looking for something to do. A month earlier, new neighbors moved into the dark house next door to him but something's strange about them. Nobody has seen or met them, weird noises come from the house at night and the property is an absolute mess. One of Ray's other neighbors, Walter disappears and Ray along with his other pals being to suspect that the Klopek's are committing murders. A very Hitchcockian plot, and who doesn't love that? The humor in the film is dark yet witty and always amusing. I especially love how the filmmakers have gone out of their way to make the Klopek family seem as unusual as possible. It creates the right sort of mood to fit with the fun loving tone. I do feel that the design of the family and their household does come off as really clichéd and corny, but I can see what they were doing when putting the movie together.The acting is great. Outside of a wonderful performance by the always great Tom Hanks, the other actors do very well too. Rick Ducommon and Bruce Dern are highly entertaining as Ray's neighbors and provide a nice mix of verbal and physical humor which I really got good laughs out of. I also quite liked Carrie Fisher. I haven't seen many movies with her outside of the Star Wars trilogy, but I feel she did fine in her role as the wife reluctant to embrace her husband's far fetched theories. Another favorite of mine is Corey Feldman. I don't think this is the best performance of his career and his character isn't all that important, but I still enjoyed him nonetheless.One thing I think is worth criticizing though is a movement done with the camera in the scene where Ray and Art find a bone. The camera quickly zooms in and out. It seemed like an attempt at creating tension or indicate surprise, but it just looked silly to me and I admit that I actually got a little giggle out of it. As for my reference to 'To Kill A Mockingbird'... look at the design of the house and the way in which the Klopeks are viewed by the other neighbors. As if they aren't making a reference to Boo Radley. Another thing worth making note of is the wonderful level of twists and turns in the story. This film didn't come out in a way I expected it to and I freaking loved that.Overall, The 'Burbs is a classic and criminally underrated film. It's a great piece of fun that mixes lightheartedness with slight Gothic undertones which results in a film that can be enjoyed by almost everyone. For Tom Hanks fans, it's a must see.9/10",The 'Burbs

The movie moves so slowly because it doesn't have an engine. Is it a comedy? No. A horror flick? No. A thriller? NO! It's just a weak commentary on the desperation of the suburbs with xenophobic overtones. Plus they treat the wives like objects with no personalities (except nags).

My parents showed me this a few years back and it's definitely become my go-to movie when I'm doing anything or just bored. Sure, it has it's creepy moments and there are some visuals that can be disturbing to some like blood and skeletons. However, it has some very well-written humour and great overall acting. The movie is serious when it needs to be and genuinely funny when it can be. Also the overall plot (and rather weird one at that) in my opinion was pretty good. Weird neighbours move in, no one really questions it but the odd friend. Other neighbours are intrigued, do all these ridiculous but funny stunts to find out more, eventually uncover a doctor to be a murdered. Sure, may sound stupid to some, but I thought it was very, very well done with a great cast. Overall I would recommend this to anyone who wants a funny/slightly creepy movie to watch.",The 'Burbs

167,oecobius,Waste of time,1,26 March 2013,"If you are very bored and just want a film to kill time, The 'Burbs might do the trick. If you want a film that will intrigue or inspire you, stay far from this one.The film centers around three utterly unlikable suburbanites: Hanks as bland weenie Ray Peterson (could the filmmakers have picked a more generic white-bread name?), Ducommun as grating slob Art Weingartner, and Dern as a wacky over-the-top veteran Rumsfield. The film could have gone in any number of clever directions with these characters, but they are all very dull and 2-dimensional. Ducommun's character fails to ever be clever or amusing, instead just being obnoxious with no payoff--many viewers tend to mute or skip through the drivel featuring him. I hoped that Rumsfield would be quirky and interesting, but he's a very stereotypical and predictable character. Thankfully, Hanks turns in a passable performance, but Ray is such a dull ""everyman"" character that we never become invested or even interested in him.The plot involves the protagonists becoming suspicious of their Eastern European neighbors, the Klopeks, and ultimately trying to prove that the Klopeks are psychotic murderers. Cheesy, predictable and slapstick hijinks ensue. The protagonists are too selfish and mean-spirited for us to like or care about them, and so there is no tension or suspense to draw you in. At the end, the movie looks as though it will feature a satisfying twist about the self-righteous, xenophobic main characters being proved wrong and having to own up to their mistake. Unfortunately, they are all proved right and vindicated in their small-minded, nasty outlooks.The film starts out with plenty of promise but goes nowhere; its ending, however, makes it utterly irredeemable. It sends an unpleasant, stupid and destructive message that people who don't conform to the privileged white American's way are insane and criminal. If you pay any attention to this film at all (instead of just using it for background noise at a party or something), you will find it either nasty or pointless.",The 'Burbs

The acting isn't even that bad!  Tom Hanks is so pathetic in his role as the ""skeptic"" of the group, and, although he has a small part, Henry Gibson is freaky.  And did you know that Carrie Fisher is in a movie other than Star Wars?Other than its comedic value, The 'Burbs has an excellent moral value too (yes, only I would look for value in a movie like this).  It shows us that even though we see others as being weird or creepy or stupid, if we look at ourselves we may find that WE are really the weird ones.

172,DaShAg,Don't mess with these suburbians !,8,8 March 2010,"""The Burbs"" is basically a satire about the daily life of suburbia, on a typical American street. The plot is very basic and won't be the reason to watch this movie. It's the characters, the suburbians that steal the show, portrayed by some awe-some comedy actors. And somehow it all falls on it's place and makes this movie a real enjoyment to watch. I've watched it a couple of times now and it still cracks me up, never gets old.Tom Hanks takes the role of Ray Peterson, a man around his 30's. Got 2 kids, a nice wife and a great house on this peculiar street. Ray is on a 2 week vacation, but he doesn't feel like going anywhere. He tells his wife he just wants to spend his free time by hanging around the house, watching TV, doing basically nothing. His character immediately reminded me of a stoner, in fact they should've made him one. All that needed to be done was giving him a big reefer in his hands, and a couple of plants in the garden. Anyways, the house next to Ray has new people living in it since a month now, and the strange thing is that nobody ever saw a single one of them, nobody is ever leaving the house and no one has ever entered it. How do they get their food one wonders. So Ray and his fellow suburbians are going to find out who the heck those people are and what they are up to. His party members consist of:Mark Rumsfield ( Bruce Dern ), a Vietnam veteran, still thinking as a die hard soldier and acting accordingly. For me this is the funniest character in the movie.Art Weingartner ( Rick Ducommun ), The big mouth know-it-all neighbor. Who can show up uninvited just to get some food or a beer. He is the one that starts the conspiracy theories against Ray's neighbors. According to Ray's wife, Art's influence changed the person she married.Ricky Butler ( Corey Feldman ), The high school kid. Enjoying everything that is happening in front of his house from the safety of his porch. He even invites his friends to come over and watch the show, while his brave neighbors are investigating the strange next door neighbors of Ray.Further more you have your typical old grumpy guy, and the hot chick which happens to be Mark's wife.So in this flick you are following these people in their quest to unravel the mystery of Ray's neighbors. Things get really intense when they find out the grumpy old man Walter Seznick ( Gale Gordon ) has disappeared and off course they all think the Klopeks ( Ray's neighbors ) have something to do with it. The movie is full of great one-liners and colorful characters. You will constantly laugh out loud and will have the urge to watch it again.Get this hidden gem and you definitely won't regret it !",The 'Burbs

All we really know about Ray Peterson is that he's on a two-week summer vacation from work. We never even learn what Ray does for a living, or where he lives, exactly, but that's a nice touch- this character is designed to represent the typical family man of American suburbia. In THE BURBS, this ordinary man stumbles onto an extraordinary mystery when a strange new family moves in next door.  The ordinary man/extraordinary situation device was perfected, of course, by Alfred Hitchcock, and Hitch seems to be the main inspiration for director Joe Dante, who masterfully weaves the darker, suspenseful scenes with hysterical comic touches.

Included in this terrific cast are Tom Hanks, who plays the skeptical neighbor of the new family on the block (a bunch of oddballs who never leave the house); Rick Ducommun, who plays the gluttonous friend of Hanks, who is convinced that the new neighbors are brain sucking murderers; Bruce Dern, the ex-soldier who hasn't quite left his miilitary roots behind him; and last, but not least, Corey Feldman, who plays the dopey teenage neighbor who basically watches the events of the movie unfold from the comfort of his front porch.  These characters are so well-acted and so downright wacky that you just have to believe there is a neighborhood somewhere with people like this.  The chemistry between everyone of the characters is simply impressive, and much of the humor of the film can be found in the often ludicrous way the director portrays their interactions.I urge anyone who has seen this film before to watch it again, this time paying little attention to the story and focusing on the superbly acted characters.",The 'Burbs

191,mastac-1,A deliciously black comedy...,8,17 August 2004,"The world of black comedies has seen few truly classic entries in the past few years. It's a very specific sub genre of comedy that is extremely hard to do well as films like Very Bad Things frequently signify. Too many of Hollywood's more recent offerings feature truly tasteless gags that poke fun at subjects that should simply be left well enough alone. Well I have to say that Hollywood could learn a thing or two from its own past in this department. I recently rediscovered a childhood favourite of mine, The Burbs, and I have to admit that age has not in the least bit dulled the film's razor sharp wit and acid tongued dialogueTom Hanks plays Ray Peterson, an overstressed suburbanite who's decided to spend his vacation lounging around the house in a vain effort to relax. Of course he finds his efforts hindered by the constant presence of his somewhat excitable neighbors Art Weingartner (Rick Ducommun) and Mark Rumsfield (Bruce Dern) who suspect the new family in the neighbourhood, the Klopeks, of being mass murderers. Together these three decide to look into the suspicious nature of their new neighbors and just what exactly it is they get up to at night, the time when the otherwise reclusive Klopeks seem to be at their most active. The premise is basically the set up for another of Joe Dante's (who directed both Gremlins and its remake in all but name, Small Soldiers) bedlam filled romps through suburbs in which he casts a sideways glance at all things American dream.Quite frankly, my nostalgia for this movie makes it hard to find fault with it. Hanks is as funny as ever, playing it relatively straight compared to his other performances of the period and bringing a lovely shade of deep seated unease to an otherwise grounded character. Bruce Dern fills his role wonderfully, as the military obsessed Rumsfield, a character surprisingly reminiscent of survivalist Burt Gummer from the Tremors movies in both his nature and ability to steal scenes. The only weak link in the leading trio is Ducommun, which is a shame as it is really Art that drives the story more than any other character in the movie. Sure, Art has to be slightly obnoxious and a little irritating but Ducommun overplays these aspects so much that I began to find it painful to watch him as the end of the movie approached. It's hardly a surprise when Hanks tries to kill him. I can't help but feel that perhaps the late John Candy would have fit the role slightly better, bringing some more human and likable qualities to the character. At times however, The Burbs can feel a little uneasy in its pacing and sense of humour. Scenes like the screaming at the bone, although funny, seem out of place in what is otherwise a movie with a very dry sense of humour. Meanwhile the Klopeks are unveiled as characters perhaps a little too late in the story for the audience to truly develop any kind of opinions about them.Despite some small problems however, The Burbs remains an extremely funny movie with some terrific dialogue and almost universally good performances from its cast. I defy anyone not to laugh at Rumsfield's fall from the roof of his house or every man Ray's furious rant at the movie's close. For fans of black comedies, The Burbs is a perfect antidote to the current glut of obnoxious Hollywood gross out comedies and the Farrelly Brothers increasingly desperate to offend pieces.",The 'Burbs

Back when I first saw The Burbs, I appreciated the crazy moments, and the image of suburbia. Everything was cozy and familiar, yet had an air of mystery and danger. It catches that sense of what a suburban town in the 80's was like to a kid, even though it's from the point of view of adults.Today, that sense still sticks, but now I enjoy the character and situational humor. It's great how the film pokes fun at the men home on vacation. How they all start acting like children at the first hint of adventure. They all seemed to be out playing with toys.

Aside from a few recognizable regulars from previous Joe Dante films (Henry Gibson, Robert Picardo, Dick Miller, etc.,) there is nothing in this film to indicate that Dande directed it. None of the odd twisted humor he brought to Gremlins, none of the manic action he brought to Innerspace. Duds like the 'burbs and Small Soldiers are simply below Dante's comic talent, and what was the writer thinking? As to the cast; Tom Hanks looks lost, possibly imitating Chevy Chase, Carrie Fisher's depressing presence reminds one of how beautiful she was long, long ago, and Bruce Dern, an actor who often goes from over-the-top loony performances to interesting thought provoking performances with surprising ease, appears to be sleep walking through every scene.

203,Mephisto-7,an underrated hitchcockian comedy masterpiece,9,28 August 1999,"THE 'BURBS is another one of those movies that just never seems to get the kind of recognition it deserves.  Having seen the film many times, my appreciation for it only grows with every consecutive viewing.  My respect for its director, the darkly witty Joe Dante, also grows with leaps and bounds.  A film that may be written off as campy 80's schlock at its first viewing, closer inspection inevitably reveals something more calculating and sinister.  Dante has managed to harness suburban paranoia and turn it against his audience, making them see things that may or may not be there. His direction also successfully captures the growing paranoia within his on-screen characters, and it seems like the neighborhood becomes darker and more sinister as the movie progresses.  Through all of this he maintains the ambiguity of the focus of the paranoia, the Klopeks.  Are they murderers or not?  Almost the entire movie can be viewed from either perspective, as the answer is only revealed at the very end of the movie.  All the elements are very reminscent of another director who turned fear and paranoia against his audience numerous times in numerous ingenious films.  That director is of course Alfred Hitchcock.  The term ""hitchcockian"" has been thrown around enough times, many times quite undeservedly.  In THE 'BURBS, the term finds a perfect home in a movie that would have done Hitch proud.  Is THE 'BURBS campy? Yes.  Is it dumb?  Not remotely.  Joe Dante weaves a intelligent narrative out of Dana olsen's shrewd script that holds us in with amusing characters and comic suspense.  He guides us along, letting us see what we want to see, waiting for the true answer.  That answer only comes at the very end of this aptly-described Hitchcockian film with an ending that is very -to coin a phrase- Dante-esque.",The 'Burbs

Tom Hanks is at his comedic best in this film, so much so that if I had any pull with the MPAA I'd have given him an Oscar back in '89. The rest of the cast is superb as well, and each of the characters is so well defined you feel like you know them. Even Jerry Goldsmith's score is a riot. I've seen this movie quite a few times and remain in awe at how sharp and funny it is with every viewing. Ray Peterson's awkward and nervous behavior in the Klopek's house is one of the most subtley funny things I've ever seen on film. Tom Hanks is a comedic genius! I cannot comprehend how Washington Post critic Hal Hinson can call The 'Burbs ""...not remotely, momentarily, intermittently, or otherwise funny."" He is simply dead wrong.

This film follows a traditional Hollywood style of plot, however it is arranged in such a way to make the entire movie feel mysterious and suspenseful while remaining very warm and welcoming. Characters are always critical, and here, the minor character are very stereotypical however the way they react to the rather natural main character Ray, played by Tom Hanks, is comedic and interesting while they are shoved into this plot driven narrative. The main character acts like a window with a revelation of the audience and he acts very predictable in all scenarios.

I've seen this movie countless times and everytime I watch it I just find new jokes to laugh at. The Noooooo...! bit is a classic and also the 'take me to the hospital I'm sick' scene is a classic moment in cinematic history. It's a real shame that it's never really been noticed because so many people are missing out. I've been spreading the word of this movie to many of my friends and when they do watch it, they just love it as much as I do. If you haven't see this, please do!! The cast is superb, especially Tom Hanks/Ray Peterson as the crumbling neighbour but the strong leading performer, Bruce Dern/Rumsfield as the the freaked out veteran and Rick Duccomun/Art as the nosey know it all in the street. Others include Corey Feldman/Ricky Butler (whatever happened to him?) and Carrie Fisher/Carol Peterson as Hanks' wife. The Klopek's are such a freaky bunch, Ray's nightmare scene is also superb and really lets everyone involved shine! Tom Hanks is my fave actor for two main reasons (excluding his charm, niceness, wit, smartness and darn good looks- BTW I'm only 15 so I'm a bit of an odd ball compared to the rest of my classmates!!! :) 1. He never fails to disappoint and 2. He is such a versatile actor. All the more reason to see this!I think I've made my point now! :) Enjoy it when you see it!

Bruce Dern is hilarious as Rumsfield, an ex soldier who still dresses in uniform and uses the terminology. The humor is kind of subtle which acutely makes it more funny. In my opinion, makes it more realistic. Subtle humor is good because you don't have the trouble of having the jokes forced out. Good comedies have been ruined by forcing jokes out.

It's always been one of those movies that you can throw in the DVD player on a rainy day or one of those days when you just feel terrible and are staying home from work or school. The way Joe Dante directs this film is perfect: it hold the tone of a late 80's/early 90's flick, yet still has an ageless essence that everyone can relate to.Tom Hanks plays the type of role that suits him best; an everyday guy that faces some kind of huge task (in this case it's proving that his neighbors are human sacrificing devil worshippers). Bruce Dern plays my favorite character, a militaristic Vietnam veteran who is filled with paranoid fear about the people across the street (and he never fails in delivering hilarious one-liners. Example: ""Smells like they're cooking a goddamn cat over there!""). Rick Ducommun fits perfectly as annoying, yet oafishly good humored friend of Hanks' and is really the one responsible for the suspicions they all share about the Klopeks. Carrie Fisher, Corey Feldman, and Courtney Gains round out the cast of believable, average citizens.The key to enjoying the film is in being able to relate to it. If you can't relate to this film, chances are you won't enjoy it.

The first time I saw it, I wasn't sure what to make of it.  I mostly thought it was weird.  I wasn't sure if the tone of the movie was supposed to be serious or funny.  Now, after having seen it many times, I realize that there is nothing serious about this movie.  I think all the critics who gave it bad reviews just didn't understand it.This is one of those movies that can be watched over and over again and it just seems to get funnier, especially when watching with people who also appreciate it.  This movie has become something of a cult film in my family. All my siblings can quote the many, classic one-liners.

I-I've never seen that.""""Klopek.  What is that, Slavic?""""In Vietnam we used to call this sort of thing bad karma.""""Sure was damp today.""
I think the funniest scene is when they go visit the Klopeks at their house so they can get to know them.  The small talk they try to make (""How's the drainage on your property?"") and the part with the pretzels and sardines and the accompanying sounds just makes me laugh.

It is set in every day America in a typical suburban setting. Even the name of the street on which this story unfolds, Mayfield Place, evokes memories of middle America.

Tom Hanks is perfect as Ray, the guy next door who doesn't want to believe what's going on in case he has to do something about it. Rick Ducommum is brilliant as his neighbor Art, who thinks that the weird new neighbors, the Kleopecks, are satanists who kidnapped the old man on the block and are using him as a ""human sacrifice"". Bruce Dern is hilarious as the retired, patriotic war veteran with his night vision goggles and arsenal of weapons. Corey Fieldman and Carrie Fisher are also good in their supporting roles and all the Kleopecks are excellently cast, especially 'Rube' and 'Hans' (""sara-deen""?). There are also some good cameos from some Joe Dante regulars including Robert Picardo. Excellent flick! If you haven't seen it, check it out.

246,lumberjackmilitia,The don't make comedies like they used to,9,30 November 2008,"It's odd for me to title my review like this considering my age, I was born in 1990 so I'm still fairly young and for the most part I am a red-blooded American teenager who loves all the new-fangled media and gadgets. However, one anomaly holds true in my mind that comedies made today are just not clever enough anymore. I am a big fan of nineties and eighties comedies because they took a basic premise and ran home with it to make it surreal (much the opposite of how comedies work today, take a surreal concept and beat it like a dead horse). The 'Burbs is a perfect example of this. I've been watching this comedy since I was five and (although my understanding of the jokes has grown immensely) I now not only enjoy the speaking jokes but the sight gags from my childhood still give me fits of giggles. You see there is a certain fondness given to each character in this, they have subtle behavior ticks that is used to it's fullest potential. Be it Art's overconfidence in his capability in various situations or Mr. Rumsfield's ridiculous veteran antics it all meshes together to make a believable silly neighborhood filled with colorful characters. The execution of various scenes is top-notch, the writers tactfully navigate the different scenarios with finesse you can't find today. Every attempt Ray and Art execute to try and expose their new neighbors is handled in a manner that will make you smile every time you recall. And rather than ending the jokes at the climax and going serious like so many comedies do now, they make some of the best jokes in the final act. It is a hilarious affair that, without giving too much away, involves some of the best physical comedy and use of character insanity to create a potent blend that you will never forget. It's not perfect, I personally find that Art can be a little obnoxious at some points, but it is definitely worth anyone's time who want to be entertained all the way till they roll on the floor.",The 'Burbs

My favorite being the character of ""Art"". He probably has the funniest lines in the movie. Corey Feldman's character isn't half bad either. There is also a neighbor in the movie that is an army veteran and unwilling to let go of his military ways. He treats every situation like he is preparing for war, or some covert espionage.

However what I can add is this, your probably not gonna like it. You might after watching it find some things funny, others just plain strange, and end up feeling ""eh"" about the movie (probably why the movie has an overall score of 6.6). To be honest, I felt the exact same way when I watched the movie for the first time. However, as it is a favorite of my parents, we would watch the movie about twice a year. I found, to my surprise, after each time I watched it I saw or heard things that I missed, found things funnier, understood references or jokes etc, and grew to love it. My point is this: So you may not like it after the first time you watch it, but give this movie a chance and, you'll love it and watch it for the rest of your life!

We all have weird neighbors and can relate to what Hanks is going through. It has also been a fantasy for many of us to try and find out exactly what our neighbors are up to, but we never have the guts to do it. Movies are made so that we can escape reality for a couple of hours and feel like we are doing things that we would most likely never get to do. This movie does it better than any other movie I have seen. Most of the other people that I have talked to have agreed with me that 'The 'Burbs' is one of the most underrated comedies ever made.

I really think there is no reason to tell more words to describe this poor story! Neither Tom Hanks, early in his carrier nor the good picture are enough to hold us in front of the big screen.

The acting is almost always done very good all the way through, Tom Hanks and the rest of the cast do a very good job of acting as the oblivious suburbanites and the villains give off not only a creepy feel but a humours one as well. The place in which it takes place is so typical of a movie of it's time that it's hard not to laugh about it.

I just hate the way TV butchers movies. I saw a TV adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula that totally omitted the character Renfield. Is that screwed, or what? There are many reasons why The Burbs hits the target when it comes to satire. Most of them seem to be covered in the other reviews given here. The one point no one has mentioned, at least in the first twenty or so reviews showing here, is the obvious nod to a particular Twilight Zone episode. I'm referring to ""The Monsters Are Due On Maple Street."" When I first saw The Burbs, I saw the plot heading right towards the Zone episode's conclusion. I just knew The Burbs was going to leave us with the Zone message: ""Just because the neighbors appear weird, doesn't necessarily mean..."" or ""They are not the monsters, WE are..."" Instead, Dante left us with the message: ""How much weirdness must a guy put up with before he says ""OK, That's it!"" or ""Yep, they's monsters alright!""",The 'Burbs

It's the story of a group of eccentric neighbors banding together to find out the identity and history of the new family(the Klopeks) that has just moved into the neighborhood.  Joe Dante does a great job of creating the perfect suburbs atmosphere with the music and sets.  The interactions between the crazy neighbors themselves are hilarious, as are their adventures as they try to discover the source of the strange noises and lights that come from the Klopek's basement at night.

For the next 6 months, I watched it every time it was on any of the ITV channels (I'm going to guess they have the UK showing rights to it?) and finally bought it for myself in May 2006.""The 'burbs"" is all about a regular kind of guy Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks) who wants to while away his week off from work by being lazy around the house and fixing the barbecue (which, by the way, never gets fixed) ... but his quiet week is interrupted by suspicious neighbours Art Weingartner (Rick Ducommun) and Mark Rumsfield (Bruce Dern) who suspect Ray's new neighbours, the Klopeks (Henry Gibson, Brother Theodore and Courtney Gains) of foul play with the other residents of Mayfield Place.

It's the kind of film you either see once and can't understand why anyone would watch it or you watch for the first time and think you've finally found what's been missing from the film industry ... then proceed to watch hundreds of more times because it's that good and that rare. If you like your films containing action and/or things to make you think, then you'll probably be the former; if, however, you just want to watch a simple comedy that's been made with real people doing things that real people do - something I've personally had trouble finding in the last few years in films - then you'll probably fit into the latter group.",The 'Burbs

278,stephen-wilson,A celebration of suburbia!,9,27 June 2004,"It's easy to mock the suburbs - there are a lot of cheap laughs to be had. Joe Dante delivers a fantastic madcap film set in the suburbs that pokes gentle fun at the foibles of suburbanites (without derision) and shows them worthy of defending. The film is a celebration of suburbia and suburban values - such as the value of being neighbourly (embodied in Mister Rogers, whose show appears partway through). Tom Hanks is Ray Petersen, and unassuming everyman whose suspicions of his sinister new neighbors blossom into a life or death struggle to protect his cul-de-sac. Featuring a host of familiar faces (including Carrie Fisher, Rick Ducommun, Henry Gibson, and Robert Picardo) the movie keeps a steady pace of action, funny dialogue and slapstick humour, all the while unfolding a mystery with wonderful melodramatic camera work and score. One of the things I love about this film is that the characters of Ray, Art and Rumsfield are very believably normal, excitable and goofy guys who come to save the day without much in the way of talent. One of the few flaws I found in the film was Corey Feldman. Admittedly, he's funny now just for being Corey Feldman, but his character irks me, and acts as little more than a running commentator on events that explain themselves. It seems that he was tacked on, perhaps even to, I don't know, appeal to a younger demographic in marketing the movie. The only noteworthy point he illustrates, that ordinary life can be entertaining to watch, is adequately implied elsewhere in the film. I might mention that the movie reminds me of the novel 'The Last Coin' by James P. Blaylock, and I can affirm that both can be enjoyed again and again.",The 'Burbs
279,DapperDanbo,"Red Rover, Red Rover, let Dante's career not be over...",7,7 July 2004,"The 'Burbs isn't one of the greatest movies ever made, but I think movies like this definitely have a place in the world of film because it's fun. Sure, it's not very sophisticated or artistic, but it wasn't just made to earn a buck, either. I appreciate the time that it took Joe Dante to figure this film out and make it. The cast is excellent. Tom Hanks is a little underplayed, even though he has his moments of fun. Rick Ducommun is the great boob of a neighbor that resembles a leech more than a man (we all know those kind of people). Finally, Bruce Dern is sweet as the Vietnam vet living out the rest of the war on his front lawn, while eating animal crackers. The other roles are fairly downplayed, not really offering the characteristics or foibles that stand out as much as our three heroes. The crew is made up of one of my favorite teams: Dante and Goldsmith. Joe Dante directs and Jerry Goldsmith writes music for it. Dante includes all his trademarks in this film: cameos by Dick Miller and Robert ""The Doctor"" Picardo, numerous homages to other films, and whimsy you can cut with a knife. Goldsmith takes the film to another level beyond the visual elements of the storytelling and adds the musical elements, which subtly shape the feel of the movie. Without the organ motif, the Klopeks wouldn't be as creepy or mysterious. Why would their neighbors suspect them of anything? Without PATTON motif, would Dern's character have been as likable or tough? Overall, ""The 'burbs"" inspires me, as a filmmaker (an amateur one at that), to go out and make a whimsical movie that's fun for the audience and shows them a fun time for an hour and a half. I'm inspired by the gags, the eccentric performances, and the music. I recommend everyone see this, just so you don't sound so lame for seeing only the popular movies that all your friends and neighbors have seen. STICK IT TO THE MAN! Oh wait...I'm one of them!",The 'Burbs

281,Batesmartinb,MUST BUY to watch,10,20 September 2013,"Gave it a ten because I love the movie but, I joined IMDb to watch this movie and it cannot be watched without purchasing. What reason did I have to join??????????? Are we required to purchase all of the good movies? Are the bombs free only? I would like to know a safe place to watch The Burbs free without spam, etc. Help please. I've tried at least 20 movie sites and problems exist at each one. Suppose I'll have to purchase but not yet. Many good reviews but no one mentions this. Funny movie. Bruce Dern's best comedy appearance by far. I suppose it's always true you get nothing for nothing but I was lead to believe I could watch it free by IMDb adds. Very misleading.",The 'Burbs

283,jruunderhill,"Predictable, Frustrating, Annoying...",1,3 July 2015,"I watched this movie solely because of the fact that it stared Tom Hanks, one of the greatest actors Hollywood has ever seen. Starting the movie, I knew nothing about the plot, what genre it fell into, or even a vague sense of what it was about. As the movie started, I was captivated by the interesting characters, the engaging dialogue, and the spot-on on satire of suburbia. After the first fifteen minutes, the movie took a sharp left turn. Every scene and every joke became painfully obvious. During the build up to every ""humorous"" moment, I found myself saying aloud what was going to happen. On top of the movie's predictability, I found it highly frustrating that the characters continually discovered seemingly incriminating evidence, but took it upon themselves to play police detective. There is a certain piece of evidence, in particular, that the family dog discovers, but the characters just chalk it up as a potential misunderstanding. In real life, if you find this type of evidence, you don't discuss it, you call the police. This ridiculous denial of hard evidence absolutely ruined the movie for me, not to mention the over-the-top, near senile, ending to a monstrosity of a movie. I didn't expect greatness from this movie when I began watching it, but I did expect to be entertained. Instead, I suffered through it because I felt vested and was constantly hoping that it would turn around and surprise me...but it never did. Sorry Tom, you are amongst the best ever, but this was certainly your worst.",The 'Burbs
284,darius-24,Ha Ha Funny,9,14 February 2006,"If you're looking for a good clean fun then you will love this movie. I have watched this movie over 100 times in ten years and I have only slightly felt bordom with it since I hit my thirties. It has an excellent storyline which draws you into a sinister genre of humor. The actors in this movie do an amazing job, the camera usage is excellent, and you can watch it several times without catching all the details. Even the garbage men in this suburban neighborhood will crack you up.Spoiler: Even the creative look of Universals splash opening pulls you in. You begin by zooming from a distant look at our planet to a small cul-de-sac in the heart of the U.S. which subty ensnares you into a wonderful, sunny suburban neighborhood. The music is melodious and soothing drawing you further into a state of suburban tranquility. It all starts with someone stepping into someones ""mess."" As the movie progresses the stepping gets deeper and deeper until the whole neighborhood becomes infected by this bizarre prying play on suburban life.",The 'Burbs
285,rtjim,What a magical experience,10,22 December 2005,"What a film to escape into! This movie captures my childhood and is still watchable today. The director/writer has paid close attention to human interaction for this movie. I love Tom Hanks's one-liners or slight facial movements, both speak volumes in a scene.Unjustified credit for this classic comedy. I would recommend this film to anyone. Some regard this as a silly film, but i don't think that comment degrades it in anyway. I like silly films, something where actors egos don't get in the way of the story. We're all here for a laugh for 1-2 hours so entertain us, we say. And this film delivers gags, and visual comedy time after time.I love the scene showing the guys as if they're kids in a street. I love this movie and have recently purchase the Soundtrack off ebay.I can watch this movie over and over again. Mrs Rumsfield is still as sexy when you watch it now. Classic quote Mrs Peterson - ""He will not come out until he resembles that man that i married."" Art Weingartner - ""We don't have that kinda time !""",The 'Burbs
286,david-27722,My favorite movie!!!,10,10 February 2020,Nothing fancy and definitely not a big blockbuster. Just a great dark comedy from the 80s about a battle for their neighborhood. I freakin love it. Coincidentally Tom Hanks just played Mr. Rogers and he was watching Mr. Rogers on tv when he woke up from his nightmare. It just takes place and is filmed right around his and a few neighbors houses. Nobody travels out of the neighborhood.,The 'Burbs
