0,bkoganbing,Percy Fawcett 1867-1925?,8,16 July 2017,"No doubt that Percy Fawcett has shuffled off this mortal coil in at least the year 1925. The British explorer and his son vanished in the deep Amazon jungle in that year on a quest to find Fawcett's fabled Lost City Of Z(ed)which is how they would say it across the pond. His quest proved to be his undoing. He was convinced that evidence of this city showing a high civilization deep in the tributary country that make up the Amazon. Quests for lost cities did in Spanish conquistadors like Hernando DeSoto. Coronado looked for his 7 cities of gold in the American southwest and Ponce DeLeon died in Florida looking for the Fountain Of Youth.Seeing the story of the real Fawcett makes me think he was the inspiration for Arthur Conan Doyle's George Challenger and those stories regarding the Lost World he sought in the same area.Fawcett had a home and hearth as well. Sienna Miller plays his wife and Robert Pattinson of the Twilight series plays his son in his last years. Fawcett is played by Charles Hunnam and all distinguish themselves in their performances. Fawcett's domestic life was hardly serene as his wife wished he'd be home more instead of weeks and months at a time when he would leave her with yet another mouth to feed.Like Francois Villon, Jean Lafitte, and Amelia Earhart whose last days are unknown and open to speculation, Fawcett's have also been ripe with argument. The scenes here with Hunnam and Pattinson resolved to meet whatever fate awaits them with the Amazon tribes they encountered are beautifully played and sure to illicit an emotional response.The cinematography is stunning, it looks a lot like the Scorsese film The Mission. The cast is perfect and the film is quite the tribute to one intrepid explorer.",The Lost City of Z
1,Leofwine_draca,Middling execution,5,10 January 2018,"THE LOST CITY OF Z is an unusually uninteresting Hollywood biopic that tells an interesting true story in a middling way. It's the tale of explorer Percy Fawcett who famously went missing in South America in the early 20th century, and the circumstances that took him there. I was hoping for some jungle madness intensity a la Herzog's AGUIRRE, WRATH OF GOD, and there is a little of that, but certainly not enough. This lengthy slow burner is too intent on charting Fawcett's other activities, including his family life and experiences in WW1, rather than focusing on his fateful exploration. Three jungle trips are featured but aside from Robert Pattinson proving himself in an unrecognisable turn, there's little of interest; it's just too drawn-out and circumstantial. Charlie Hunnam is okay as the lead but hardly makes for a charismatic figure and the film overall has little feeling or depth to it. You're left not really caring about what happens, despite the handsome photography et al.",The Lost City of Z
2,SnoopyStyle,beautiful but meanders,7,20 January 2018,"It's 1905 Ireland. Major Percy Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam) with no medals is snubbed for his unfortunate choice of ancestors. He eagerly accepts the Royal Geographical Society's mission to map a river in the amazon to calm the near-warring Bolivia and Brazil. He leaves behind his wife Nina (Sienna Miller) and young children. He is joined by Henry Costin (Robert Pattinson). The group guided by a former slave native finds evidences of civilization in the jungle. Percy returns to ridicule for his claim of a lost city of Z. James Murray (Angus Macfadyen) is one of his few supporters who joins him on the next expedition. Murray turns out to be an incompetent coward who sabotages the quest and demeans him upon return to London. He is dismissed by everyone including his angry son Jack. After being temporarily blinded by a heroic action in WWI, he returns to England vindicated and his son Jack (Tom Holland) convinces him to lead one final quest for his lost amazonian city.There are some beautiful scenes. The quest is a personal epic. The acting is fine. At its best, the river journey is Apocalypse Now. The story does meander since there are actually three journeys. The back and forth keeps the flow disjointed. My favorite parts are all in the Amazon. The native in the first quest is compelling. The second is Murray's cowardice. The third is the native warriors. I almost wish for a fictionalization with one simple journey.",The Lost City of Z
3,boblipton,Piffle,5,16 March 2020,"No decision should ever be made without consulting women, who are each and every one wiser than any man. White men are evil, particularly those who are successful; if they have packed on some extra weight, they are vicious. Only people who live in the back of beyond and shoot anyone who shows up are possessed of true virtue. These are the accepted assumptions of modern people, who make technological constructs costing tens of millions of dollars about this, like, well, this movie.My cousin and I saw this Sunday, and I have spent the last couple of days being annoyed. I went to see a movie set in the years 1910-1924. I saw a movie about 2017 characters. Perhaps this is always the way of movies; maybe it's not just the hair style that gives away the fact that a movie set in 1478 was actually made in, say 1948. Likely as I grow older and more disjoint from this world, I see the anachronisms more clearly: not just the devices, but the attitudes.Anyway, it's based on Percy Fawcett, British Major, surveyor and general nut, and his expeditions to Amazonia. It's a hagiography.Apparently the farmers who lived and worked near where the crew shot this wrote to the papers complaining about the noise, the explosions and gunfire from where the crew was shooting. That's just like farmers, always putting their interests ahead of movies made by White men explaining how bad White men are.",The Lost City of Z
4,Horst_In_Translation,Great watch for people who are into explorer movies,6,6 May 2017,"""The Lost City of Z"" is an American movie from 2016 and this one is the newest work by writer and director James Gray. This time he did not collaborate with Joaquin Phoenix, but despite being a great Phoenix fan I must say this movie does not need him to be a success. It runs for a really long 2 hours and 20 minutes, but time pretty much flew by and the movie never dragged. This film is about the life and work of British explorer Percy Fawcett played by Charlie Hunnam (""Sons of Anarchy""). I must say I have not come across anything (memorable) by this actor and saw little in him beyond a hunky physicality, but he played his part well here and is one of the main reasons why it all worked out so well. Robert Pattinson (""Twilight"") plays one of the biggest supporting parts and he is surely the biggest name attached to the project. The likes of Sienna Miller, Tom Holland and perhaps Angus Macfadyen will be known to film buffs too though. And I see that western legends Franco Nero has a small part in it too. Shame I did not recognize him.Anyway, the best aspect of this film is the story/writing though. This already starts with the character of Percy Fawcett, who was entirely unknown to me before seeing this movie, but he really should not have been. They made a good choice I guess in focusing not on just one of his many journeys, but including several as at this runtime, 2 hours, exclusively in the jungle may have been too much. But the path they took made it interesting too as we do not only learn a lot about the central character's family, but also for example about his time with the military. And these parts weren't worse than the ones in the jungle. Not at all. Like I said, they added a nice mentality to the entire project and kept it from having lengths. The ending is also a nice addition because you never knew what to expect and if it takes the happy route or not as you (or I) were not aware of the central character's fate eventually. In terms of the visual side (costumes, sets, cinematography) there is nothing wrong either and it's a solid job no matter which component we are talking about.I can see why this film garnered a good deal of awards attention already despite how new it all is. At least here in Germany. I really cannot think of any weak component here and the only reason why I do not give it a higher rating is probably because the genre itself is not really one that appeals to me that much. But those who like adventure films will have a great time watching for sure. The real life references, even if a lot has been changed for dramatic purpose (like for example that in the end it's just the two of them), make it even more interesting. Tough to find flaws. I think I could have done without the Sienna Miller (she still was really good in her scenes) epilogue eventually, even if it includes an important reference to the real Percy Fawcett too, but I still may have preferred the film to end in the jungle somehow. I particularly recommend this movie to those who for example like ""Master and Commander"", but even those who have little connection to the genre like myself can enjoy it for what it is. I very much recommend checking it out.",The Lost City of Z
5,nogodnomasters,The Green Desert,6,20 April 2018,"This is based on the true story of British explorer Colonel Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam ) searching for a lost city of Zed in the Amazonian rain forest. The film did not use some of his more extraordinary claims of fantastic beasts and where to find them. It stuck to the bare bone facts. I was waiting for some great scene to make the film, and it wasn't there. His exploration appears to have been a walk in the park with arrows. Perhaps the fascinating bit of the film was that after centuries, the native populations held traditions and stories of Zed whose existence has been confirmed, but the forest has reclaimed the details. Where is Harrison Ford when you need him?",The Lost City of Z
6,kosmasp,Lost and Found (not),8,14 February 2021,"A true story - real characters to portray. Not always something easy to convey. And as the rating shows here not always welcome. Especially if the movie is relatively tough to watch and even tougher to promote. You got quite the interesting cast together - with Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson two ""rivals"" from different comic universes, portraying arguable the most recognizable of each brand. You may disagree with that of course, don't take it personal.Also remember that this is not a comic book movie. This is about exploring the wilderness and fighting against prejudices in every which way. And a family drama ... so as I said, it really is tough to put a finger on this and make it accessible to the masses I reckon. But anyone who is smitten by its story, will get quite the epic adventure and drama. A journey that is more than worth watching, flaws and all considered.",The Lost City of Z
7,classicsoncall,"""A man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a Heaven for?""",8,24 January 2019,"While watching, I had no idea the film was based on a true story. That makes it more interesting in retrospect. Reading some of the trivia notes for the picture here on IMDb, I was intrigued by the fact that the novelist Sir Arthur Conan Doyle based his Professor Challenger character on that of Percy Fawcett. They in fact were good friends, and Doyle was present at the Royal Geographical Society lecture of February 13th, 1911, the one in which Fawcett described his expedition to Huanchaca Plateau in Bolivia. Fawcett's memoirs, which were posthumously published, spoke of the possibility of ""monsters from the dawn of man's existence"", an idea taken to heart by Doyle when he came up with his science-fiction novel titled ""The Lost World"". Quite coincidentally, the silent film version of ""The Lost World"" was released in 1925, the same year Fawcett went missing with his son in The Amazon.What fascinates me about Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam) is that he was determined to return to the Amazon time and again following the first expedition to delineate the border between Bolivia and Brazil. Though that occurred over a span of twenty years, the man never lost his innate desire to find out the truth about a possible 'lost city' that might have existed deep in the jungle, pre-dating the arrival of white men who would doubt the ability of savages to create a civilization. The only disconnect in the story for me was when Fawcett encountered various tribes and attempted the use of Spanish to address the natives as 'amigos'. Barring contact with the outside world, the idea didn't make much sense to me, especially when he would occasionally get a response.Beautifully filmed, the jungle scenes are breathtaking in scope, and painfully illustrate the types of hardship and discomfort Fawcett's expeditions would have to contend with. Determined to find glory for his home country of England, it was devastating to learn that his final foray into the Amazon was one of no return. The scene in which Fawcett and his son (Tom Holland) were taken captive by a tribe who saved them from an earlier fateful encounter eventually resolves to speculation about how they may have met their deaths. One would also have to speculate as to the veracity of that scene in which Mrs. Fawcett (Sienna Miller) returns the watch presented to her husband by the Royal Geographical Society. Despite the various anomalies, I enjoyed the story and found it a rather thought provoking one, soon to be a century since the tragic disappearance of Percy Fawcett.",The Lost City of Z
8,lee_eisenberg,it's a story for the ages,9,15 August 2017,"I had never heard the story of Percy Fawcett and his search for a lost city until now. ""The Lost City of Z"" is an impressive piece of work. It not only focuses on Fawcett's quest to find the presumed city, but also his British peers' disbelief of his claims (and the general British attitude towards non-white people), and briefly on World War I.It's not a great movie, but it has some amazing shots of the Amazon rain forest. The cast does well enough in their roles. I particularly liked Robert Pattinson and Ian McDiarmid, both of them playing roles markedly different from their most famous ones.Whether or not we eventually find out the full story of what happened, I still recommend this movie. It might make you feel like doing a little exploring.",The Lost City of Z
9,LeonLouisRicci,Expansive Entertainment with a Throw-Back Style...Beautiful but Bewildering,7,3 September 2017,"Sprawling, Episodic, and Beautiful to Look at, but this Ambitious Effort to Tell the Tale of Real-Life Explorer and Adventurer Percy Fawcett may be a Let Down for Modern Film-Goers as it chooses to more or less Document with Little or No Embellishment. In the Entertainment World that is as Daring as its Human Subject.The Movie is an Expensive, Laborious Shoot that some may say has No Money Shot. The 2 1/2 Hour Film takes its time with the Foreplay setting up Real Conflicts, Politics, and Family Drama.This is Interspersed with Percy's Trips to Amazonia, all 3, and in each case the End barely Justifies the Means. His Persistent Passion is Evident as He not only Confronts the Unexplored Jungle but Societal Roadblocks and Class Snobbery. The Movie even takes Time with Nods to Feminine Warriors and the War to End All Wars.The Movie is a Real-Life Mystery in the End and Percy's Reach Never Grasped the Glory of Discovery. It's a Glorious Story, well Worth Telling and is Presented here with some Gusto and it is Fine Film-Making with Artistry Apparent in Every Scene.Worth a Watch for Lovers of Old-School Adventure, a Throwback Cinematic Style, and Stories Summoned from a Pre-Modern Era Filled with Lost Worlds and an Earth Worlds Removed from Satellite Data Available to Anyone at Anytime with a Click.",The Lost City of Z
10,CinemaSerf,Interesting story of grim determination...,6,3 April 2020,"This is a slow burn, but worth the effort of sticking with as Charlie Hunnam takes on the role of real-life explorer Col. Percy Fawcett; who is initially charged with sorting out a tiresome border dispute between the colonial powers in Bolivia. Accompanied by his aide - Henry Costin (Robert Pattinson) they set off and battle exhaustion, disease, heat and natives on their quest. They also, surprisingly, discover evidence of a civilisation so vow to return - better equipped, and despite the concerns of Fawcett's wife (a somewhat stoically resigned Sienna Miller) - to find the source of these artefacts. Despite their best efforts, again the elements defeat them; then WWI intervenes before, finally - and this time with the support of his son Jack (Tom Holland) they go back for a final attempt. We know not what happened to them all so the narrative is somewhat speculative, especially at the end, but it does build a clear picture of the grim determination of the man; clearly inherited by his son, to seek out ""Z"". It is too long, there is a repetitive element to the search/retreat/search again structure of James Gray's film that does lead to bouts on ennui at times; the photography is beautiful and conveys the relentlessness of the unforgiving forest - but just a bit too often. That said, though, this is a fine piece of acting from Hunnam showing that he is not just an handsome lad with limited scope.",The Lost City of Z
11,oscaralbert,Considered the Primary Source Material for about half of Literature's Jungle Books . . .,8,8 May 2017,". . . Percy Fawcett was friends with the authors of SHERLOCK HOLMES and SHE. He's also the inspiration for the Monty Python skit in which one of the crew takes a Backbush Constitutional and another soon stumbles into the steaming pile, removes his boot, sniffs its sole, and remarks, ""Dr. Livingston, I presume."" That's because Percy entered the Amazonia Rain Forest on his Lucky Seventh Expedition intending to install his eldest son Jack as God for the local tribes, only to Beta Test the Art of the Deal: Percy himself wriggled out of a sticky wicket by divvying up Jack's remains among the tribe in question, cementing his own future as a Cannibal King and giving rise to the English fatalism, ""Sometimes you eat the Gods, and sometimes the Gods eat you."" Essentially, THE LOST CITY OF Z covers about 8% of the tamer events in Percy Fawcett's known life. In addition to discovering perhaps half of South America's various unique species, Percy may well have stumbled across one or more Fountains of Youth, in which case he's still alive and chowing down on ""the other White meat"" even Today!",The Lost City of Z
12,evanston_dad,Unforgivable Bastardization of Actual Events,3,31 December 2017,"If a viewer didn't read anything about the actual adventurer Percy Fawcett and his experiences exploring the Amazon jungle in the early part of the 20th Century, ""The Lost City of Z"" would probably strike him as a pretty decent historical adventure with some good central performances and a welcome message about embracing little known cultures that gives it a sense of relevancy in our current cultural climate. But if one reads even a little about the real Fawcett and his attitudes, this film becomes an unbearable concoction that takes a complicated story and character and turns it into yet another white male savior story, one that is totally tone deaf to conversations happening in the real world at this moment.Percy Fawcett was a bigot who pretty much abandoned his family for his megalomaniacal obsessions, and he had so much trouble reconciling the actual Amazonian natives he found with the preconceived notions he had of them in his head (in other words, they weren't as savage as he wanted them to be) that he invented the theory that a race of ""white"" natives emigrated to the Amazon first and created a new race. But in the movie, Fawcett, as played by Charlie Hunnam, is fascinated with the people of the Amazon and advocates for them in the face of obstinate English attitudes about white European supremacy. And his family, particularly his wife, played by Sienna Miller, maybe once in a while misses him, but mostly are proud and supportive of his exploits. In the real story, Fawcett left his family destitute and they had to live a nomadic existence, moving from her to there in an effort to scrape together the means of subsistence.I'm the last person to demand that movies based on historical events be rigidly faithful, and I'm comfortable with dramatic license. But there are limits, especially when the director and writer chooses to focus his story on race during such a racially charged moment in history. James Gray has defended himself by saying that he wanted to focus on Fawcett's accomplishments rather than his faults, and that if he had been portrayed as the ass that it sounds like he was audiences wouldn't have been able to see past that. To which I say, ""Why don't you let your audience figure that out for themselves?"" Instead, he decides to condescendingly give us the version of the story he wishes had existed, as if the people going to see it don't know how to look things up on Google, and doesn't give us the chance to digest a more complex version of events for ourselves. Where is Werner Herzog when you need him?This is by no means a badly made movie, and in many ways is actually a well made one, but its casual distortion of history prevents me from being able to give it a high rating or recommend it to anyone.Grade: C-",The Lost City of Z
13,ferguson-6,3 trips,8,20 April 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. We aren't likely to watch a more beautiful or expertly photographed film this year. Director James Gray's project looks and feels like a throwback to days of epic filmmaking, and cinematographer Darius Khandji (Se7en, Evita, The Immigrant) fills the screen with green and gold hues (similar to Out of Africa) that deliver both a sense of realism and a touch of romanticism. The minor quibble here is with the emphasis on the biographical rather than the more interesting and compelling and adventuresome expeditions to the ""new"" world.Our true to life hero (and the film's portrayal provides no other description) is military man and explorer Percy Fawcett played by Charlie Hunnam. Based on the book by David Grann, the film divides focus into three areas: the stuffy, poorly lit backrooms of London power moguls; the 1916 WWI front line where Fawcett proves his mettle; the jungles of Amazonia wherein lies Fawcett's hope for glory and redemption. It's the latter of these that are by far the most engaging, and also the segments that leave us pining for more detail.The three Fawcett expeditions form the structure for the quite long run time (2 hours, 21 minutes). In 1906 the Royal Geographic Society enlisted Fawcett for a ""mapping"" journey to distinguish boundaries around Bolivia in what had become a commercially important area due to the black gold known as rubber. Fawcett was not just a manly-man, he was also obsessed with overcoming his ""poor choice in ancestors"" and gaining a position of status within society. Using his military training and personal mission, that first expedition (with help from a powerful character played by the great Franco Nero) was enough to light Fawcett's lifelong fixation on proving the existence of Z (Zed) and the earlier advanced society.Back home, Fawcett's wife Nina (Sienna Miller) shows flashes of turn-of-the-century feminism, though lacking in judgment when she suggests a ridealong with her husband on his next expedition. Although the couple spends little time together, given the years-long trips, they do manage to produce a hefty brood of kids, the eldest played by Tom Holland (the new Spider-Man).1912 brings the second Amazonia expedition, the one in which renowned Antarctic explorer James Murray (a snarly Angus Macfayden) joins Fawcett and his by now loyal and expert travel companion Henry Costin (a terrific Robert Pattison). The trip proceeds as one might expect when an ego-driven, unqualified yet wealthy passenger is along for only the glory. Murray's history is well documented and here receives the treatment he earned.It's the third trip in 1925 that Fawcett makes with his son that will be his last, and the one that dealt the unanswered questions inspiring Mr. Grann to research and write his book. It's also the segment of the film that leaves us wanting more details  more time in the jungle. With the overabundance of information and data available to us these days, the staggering courage and spirit of those willing to jump in a wooden canoe on unchartered waters and trek through lands with no known back story, offer more than enough foundation for compelling filmmaking. It's this possibility of historical discovery that is the real story, not one man's lust for medals and confirmation. More jungle could have elevated this from very good to monumental filmmaking.",The Lost City of Z

His journeys are quite scary but what did he really achieve? Then fighting in WW1 trenches after that is just too much.OMG the ending is so depressing. Father and son dumb and dumber. Both of them being cannibalized or worse? With the advent of airplanes they didn't need to go by land. What's wrong with the 2 of them? And to go alone at the end?

Sienna Miller is on hand as Fawcett's wife back in England.""The Lost City of Z"" (2016) is based on the real-life account, although Fawcett's eight expeditions into the Amazon are truncated to three in the movie. Some things are naturally reminiscent of ""Fitzcarraldo"" (1982). While I like that picture a little more, this one ain't no slouch if you're in the mood for a realistic biographical adventure. Being based on a true story, don't expect any goofy Indiana Jones shenanigans, although there are a couple of scenes evocative of the opening jungle sequence in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981).The film runs 2 hours, 21 minutes, and was shot in Northern Ireland and Magdalena, Colombia; the river is Rio Don Diego.GRADE: B",The Lost City of Z
16,lasttimeisaw,certainly a rewarding viewing experience,8,4 May 2017,"An epic biography of British explorer Percy Fawcett, at first glance, doesn't seem to be in the American filmmaker James Gray's elements, his fifth feature film is also his first venture into a period setting, traversing two continents and spanning two decades (from 1905 to 1925), as our current fatigue towards the obsequiously awards-coveting biopic genre still persists, could Mr. Gray's offering dissipate the lethargy of blasé and inscribe his own footprint in the rut? The answers are no and yes. The blasé timber lies in the material itself, it is after all, a heroic story (tinged with a pinch of mythos) begging for adulation, and Gray chooses to recount Percy's (Hunnam) extraordinary life in a faithfully chronological order and establishes him as an every-man but bristling with vim and vigor, thus we could safely rule out the imperious internecine conflicts à la Klaus Kinski in Werner Herzog's two expedition pieces, during his perilous adventures among the tropical jungles and waterways. The character development is formulaic and painstakingly eschews a larger-than-life approach, for example, a full-bearded Robert Pattinson downplays Percy's fellow explorer Henry Costin, shadowing his footsteps but is left with no florid delivery to chew on, neither does Hunnam's taciturn hero, but perversely, that is where Gray makes his mark.The film is anything but a hagiography, which entails that Gray's script gives the room to let his characters live and breathe as authentic as possible, emotions are measured, feelings are understated, words are superfluous (except for the sporadic wrangles and squabbles, whether they are marital, familial or academic, Angus Macfadyen palpably plays an exasperating benefactor who is not prepared for the expedition and comes off as a petty denigrator), but the awe towards an unfamiliar culture is immeasurable (however primordial and savage it transpires), so what we are privileged to watch is a series of minutely orchestrated fluxes of Percy's life: the first two botched voyages, his WWI stint, the calm days after and his last outing with his eldest son Jack (Holland) to look for a closure towards his life-long pursuit, all is rendered with ineffable beauty through the craft of its art production and Darius Khondji's stunning camera-work, which doesn't operate the usual method of sweeping aerial shots foregrounding the Amazonian locale, but takes a closer inspection of the mysterious lushness buzzed with vitality and danger, simultaneously. The nocturnal ritual sequences during the climax are transcendent, when our protagonists are carried off-screen to their ambiguous destiny, what we see is the misty, ethereal environs, shimmering with a dark-blue sheen, that is a reverent homage to the unknown and the divine. So is the final shots, focusing on Nina (Miller), Percy's forbearing wife, whatever has happened, happened, it is what her husband and son want, she has to come to terms with that. So a gorgeous finishing touch shows Nina seemingly wend her way into a tropical forest, to unfold that hopes are never dashed, even it is solely for her sake, a reunion (or reconciliation) is powerfully but quietly sublimated, however ambivalent it looks.Hunnam exudes a more internal aspect of his acting range through his deeply immersed effort, his version of Percy is a hyperbole-free doer, a trailblazer, a leader; whereas Miller, ostensibly is saddled with a traditional wife role, who is platitudinously burdened with child-bearing and an often absent husband, but doesn't sit contently in the back seat, Gray's sensible script commendably amps up her narrative arc, and Miller shines beautifully when being granted a chance to express her feelings and views, counterpointing the milieu's conservative reality. Perhaps out of the respect of his subject, James Gray doesn't deign to buoy up the narrative with cinematic gimmicks or unwarranted action enhancers, thus the final outcome is an attentive, albeit conventional adaptation of a real-life adventurer combating his way through the untrod-den path, it takes some patience to dawdle through its longueur but ultimately it is certainly a rewarding viewing experience.",The Lost City of Z
17,Hellmant,"What's most impressive about the film though, is how much it resembles classic cinema of yesteryear!",8,11 May 2017,"'THE LOST CITY OF Z': Four Stars (Out of Five) An adventure biopic, based on the 2009 book (of the same name) by David Grann. It's about the British explorer Percy Fawcett; who disappeared in 1925, with his son, after trying to find a lost city in the Amazon. The film stars Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson, Sienna Miller and Tom Holland. It was written and directed by James Gray; who also performed both duties on such critically acclaimed films as 'THE IMMIGRANT', 'WE OWN THE NIGHT', 'TWO LOVERS' and 'THE YARDS'. The movie has received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, and it's performed modestly at the Box Office so far. While the film is a little too slow-paced at times (for me), I mostly found it to be a very well made and entertaining movie (especially for a biopic).The story begins in Ireland, in 1905, when Percy Fawcett is a skilled British officer participating in an elk hunt (for the benefit of visiting Austro-Hungarian nobility). Although Fawcett kills the elk, he's snubbed at the after-party (due to his social standing). The next year he's asked to lead an expedition in the Amazon jungle (over a Brazil and Bolivia border dispute). While on the expedition, Fawcett meets Corporal Henry Costin (Pattinson); who was sent to join Percy (due to his knowledge of the Amazon jungle). While exploring, Fawcett and Costin discover evidence of an ancient lost city. They have trouble convincing others of it back home in England though. Fawcett then makes it his life obsession to return to the Amazon, and find the city once again (to prove of it's existence to the world). He makes multiple more attempts at it, over several following years, before his disappearance.The movie is extremely slow-paced, as it starts out, and I had trouble staying interested in it. It does get much more interesting, and involving, about 30-minutes into the film though. From then on, I really enjoyed it. It's definitely not an action-packed movie, but it is very fascinating and intense (especially for a biopic). Hunnam is great in the lead; and Miller, Pattinson and Holland all give fine supporting performances as well. What's most impressive about the film though, is how much it resembles classic cinema of yesteryear (from several decades ago). Grann has definitely proved what a talented and highly skilled director he is.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/217879519",The Lost City of Z
18,MOscarbradley,An art movie more than a conventional adventure epic...and a very fine one.,9,27 May 2018,"Far from a conventional 'jungle adventure' James Gray's outstanding ""The Lost City of Z"" has more in common with the films of Werner Herzog than ""The Mission"". Bases on real events it's the story of explorer Percival Fawcett's search for the lost city of the title deep in the Bolivian jungle. It is a long, slow film more concerned with the psychology of its characters than their actions and it's very well played by Charlie Hunnam, (a revelation), Robert Pattinson and, in a major supporting turn, Angus MacFadyen. It's also stunningly shot by the great Darius Khondji and superbly written and directed by Gray, moving away here from the gritty confines of the American city where we usually find him. It wasn't really a commercial success but then in this day of action superheroes did anyone really think it would be.

The strengths of The Lost City of Z lie with its unique journey the protagonist takes, and not necessarily with the protagonist or the film itself. What I mean by that is that I think the actual story the film is based on is more interesting than how the film portrays it. Sometimes biopics that span a great length of time are difficult to effectively portray on the big screen. Because 'Z' takes place over the course of roughly 20 years, it becomes increasingly tough to grapple onto something worth enjoying. Every time one of his explorations seems to get interesting, we get interrupted by his abrupt return to civilization and more family drama. Whether or not that's how the true story of Percy Fawcett went is irrelevant. Sometimes it takes some tweaking to make for an entertaining feature length film.Charlie Hunnam plays Fawcett, an explorer who seeks glory in finding a mysterious city of people which has ""never been touched by a white man"". Fawcett himself is an interesting character, especially when the film dives into his own psychology and obsession over 'Z'. He's a lot like Matthew McConaughey's character from Interstellar, always searching for something nobody has seen before even if means leaving his family for years at a time. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why Fawcett isn't very likable. We constantly see him leave his family even though, with the exception of war, he has a choice in the matter.There is something to admire about someone, or in this case multiple people, who keep searching for the dreams no matter the cost. Fawcett, along with a few consistent compadres, go on dangerous expeditions through the jungle to find what they think is a real lost city. The aspects of the film I enjoy the most are watching men go through hardships in search of something they truly care about. In this regard, the film is a fascinating exploration physically and mentally.Aside from Hunnam, there are a few great performances from Sienna Miller as Nina Fawcett, Robert Pattinson as Henry Costin, and Tom Holland as Jack Fawcett. All elevating each scene they are in and making the journey worth it for sure. There's a lot this film does well, including making a lasting impact on viewers minds in terms of exploration, but the writing can be a little bit more polished with certain changes made to fit a movie and not just serve the story properly. There's a happy medium there that I think could have benefited the final product.+The Story+Brings back a lost genre-Uncharismatic characters-Uneven script6.7/10",The Lost City of Z
20,A_Different_Drummer,Unusual Review Notes for an Unusual Movie,7,27 June 2017,"That the movie succeeds is a credit to Hunnam, who comes of age both literally and figuratively in this movie with a performance of great humility, charm, and grit. A far cry from his breakout role as a motorcycle gang leader, and an even further cry from his awkward performance in Guy Ritchie's unique (and hopefully never-to-be-repeated) view of young King Arthur as a slum thug.Props to audiences worldwide who are connecting with a 2 hour and 20 minute opus that is as far from the new Transformers attempt as the earth is from the moon. Shows that quality film-making will always find an audience.Would have been nice if the script were historically accurate but perhaps that is asking too much. Ironically, because of the internet, the amount of solid new archaeological evidence being released each 24 hours in today's world would be the equivalent of ten years of time in Fawcett's era. In particular, I am referring to the material of late which suggests lost civilizations submerged in both the Atlantic and the Pacific over 12,000 years ago (see Graham Hancock's lectures for more, most free on Youtube) would explain how Brazil, centered between the two, could indeed have hosted a ""lost city"" which, thousands of years ago, entertained guests from both realms.Finally -- for hard-core history buffs only -- the written diagrams preserved even today in the Archives of Rio de Janeiro (""Folio #512"") which constitute the last known ""communication"" from the ACTUAL final, ill-fated, Fawcett expedition were discredited because ""experts"" of the day claimed they contained elements of different language roots, not one root, and hence ""must"" be fake. However, if indeed the area was a centerpoint between two now-lost civilizations originating in two different oceans, the multiple language roots would be expected and natural, and not an indication of fraud.",The Lost City of Z

Neither father nor son returned to Nina Fawcett (Sienna Miller).The haunting tale of Fawcett's real life disappearance that still remains unsolved, this artfully shot biography is an engaging adventure saga that is hindered by poor editing, a prolonged narrative and a weak lead.Incidentally, if lost tribes wanted Englishmen to find them then they would build pubs.

I did not expected much from this movie, but what i got to see is one the best movies from 2016 which i saw only now. Shame on my for missing this movie on a big screen back in the day.""The Lost City of Z"" is not a commercial movie to begging with. The story here is kinda slow, and seemingly there aren't many ""involving adventures"". But this is a movie which literally transported me into the time and location. And what a haunting, harsh, beautiful and bold this world was.Directing was simply amazing. At running time 2 h and 15 min i wished this movie lasted longer (seriously). Setting were simply real. Acting by great - this has to be the best performance by Charlie Hunnam yet. Robert Pattinson totally disappeared into the role - its one of his very best - great two lead performances.Overall, ""The Lost City of Z"" is kinda old fashioned movie about journey, discoveries and everything in between. It is superbly crafted, amazingly acted and sometimes very haunting journey into unknown. Its also sadly one of the most underrated and overlooked movies in resent memory. Great movie.",The Lost City of Z
23,clanciai,The problems of adventure on the highest level,9,7 March 2021,"The main point of this film is that it is a true story, and it's a great story, telling the quest of Percy Fawcett in his irrepressible idealism and fixed idea of finding the lost city in the Amazonas which he on his first journey thought he found a trace of, before he had to turn back - that was usually the case with such expeditions in the old days, they found something and had to leave it there for next time. He simply has to turn back again and again, just like a mountain climber has to try again after the first and second failures, because the mountain is still there challenging him. It's also the story of his family, he gets two children already before the first expedition and a second son before the second, and in between he suffers a grave injury in the first world war, losing his eyesight for some years. Still he has to return, and on his last voyage his eldest son is actually the chief prompter of the expedition, and no one will ever know what happened to them. The main red thread of the film is the penetration into the exploration spirit and its mentality, which becomes an obsession, like of any gambler, but concerning exploration it is on a so much more monumental scale. Perhaps the greatest credit of the film is its consistent realism, nothing is romanticised or euphemised, the ordeals of both the expedition complications and of the war are displayed in abhorrent sincerity, and Charlie Hunnam makes an absolutely convincing personality of his role. It's a great film, and it will be worth watching again at times.",The Lost City of Z
24,Reno-Rangan,"He wasn't the first, but came close to let the world know his founds.",7,24 September 2017,"I don't know what were the people expecting from it, another 'Indian Jones'? Booby traps, man eating ants, ancient alien ship et cetera? Well, I agree it was slow and boring in parts, but most importantly, it was only revealed the true story. Not all the biopics are delightful entertainer. Originally this tale took place for three decades, but what you saw on the screen was merely a highlight. All about the adventures. The personal life was less focused. Especially the final act was honest. Because it is a mystery. So people should appreciate for the effort from the filmmakers.I really enjoyed it. A film like this hard to come by. I mean when a film based on a real person was made a film, people expect the only heroic act, instead of truth. That kind of mindset need to be changed in order to enjoy it. Or else pick the those similar commercial films instead of it. Charlie Hunnam was impressive, probably his film best I've seen so far. He always reminds me Tom Hardy for having a similar facial. There were others in the film, but only he had piloted it.It's weird that it should have been a British film, but Hollywood made it. Above all, the funny thing was they correctly pronounced the Z as Zed. Anyway, that's how the real story was. The jungle scenes were awesome. In many parts it was very suspense like when they had contact with the Amazonia tribes. I was very curious about what would happen. Because all I remember was 'The Green Inferno'. Those who are interested in the history and archaeological expedition, this film would be the right choice, but anticipate reality, not something out of the world.7/10",The Lost City of Z
25,cruise01,A mans obsession on achieving his goal for a search on the lost city.,8,30 April 2017,"A mans obsession on finding the lost city in the amazon can achieve his goal. The Lost City of Z is an adventurous drama film based on a British explorer Percy Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam). I thought the film was fast paced and explored several years and the events attempts of Fawcett going out in the amazon to map survey and finding artifacts about a lost city. The plot follows Percy, who is assigned to survey the amazon and to follow a river path that is in uncharted territories. Costin (Robert Pattinson) is also with him on this journey, were they will come across indigenous tribes. Percy made the sacrifice to go on this several year journey, leaving his pregnant wife Nina (Sienna Miller) behind, along with his son Jack (Tom Holland). This struggle on taking this assignment is difficult on being away from his family but he will claim his family's name, if he does this task. Percy and Costin traveling through the rivers, coming across a tribe that is cannibalistic on eating their own with a belief of setting their spirit free when this tradition is done. They reach the rivers end only to see pottery artifacts that Percy believes there was once an advanced civilizations and a lost city. They arrive home, only to see his son all grown up and his wife. His obsession on finding this lost city which could have gold and ancient artifacts gets worse. With the support of his son Jack, who is willing to go with his father to go searching for this city.What I liked about the film is it is well paced when it begins with Percy in the military and getting offered to go on an expedition. Many years go by, and seeing Percy and his relationship with his wife, slowly getting distant when he is gone for so many years. When he is home, his desire to go back out is always putting his own family in second to this obsession. The film does have an incredible tone and direction seeing Percy and Costin traveling in the amazon with tribes that are attacking them and the eerie wilderness. The cinematography work was impressive. The cast did great. Charlie Hunnam delivered a good performance with a characters obsession that he will never give up his dreams on this search. Robert Pattinson also had a better performance as well. Sienna Miller did great. Along with Tom Holland and his short appearance. What I did not liked about the film is I did feel like the movie was quite long. It did have a perfect flow with the pace and storytelling. But it started to slow down in the final half hour of the movie when Percy was giving up and his son motivated him to go back into this expedition. Overall, The Lost City of Z is a good adventure drama film with great performances, direction, and plot. Especially with this being based on an actual explorer and the events that led to his disappearance in 1925.",The Lost City of Z

Had somewhat high expectations given how strong praise this film is from critics. As a film, it drags on and the story is ultimately dull and boring. Was hard keeping focus on what was occurring. This film was a box office flop and after watching the film, one can see why.",The Lost City of Z
27,eddie_baggins,An impressively old-school adventure film,8,22 August 2017,"It seems like many moons ago that we first heard of news of a big screen adaptation of The New Yorker staff writer David Grann's famed non-fiction novel The Lost City of Z.At one stage or another starring Brad Pitt and then Benedict Cumberbatch as real life early 19th century explorer Percy Fawcett, this passion project of acclaimed dramatic director James Gray is a visually sumptuous epic that draws out the best big screen performance yet from its leading man Charlie Hunnam, as we're drawn deep into the Amazonian jungle as Fawcett and his small band of men venture off into the wilds to find evidence of a mysterious ancient city that would rewrite the history books.It's fantastic that Gray stuck by this fascinating story and ploughed on no matter the hardships as The Lost City of Z feels like an adventure film from yester year.Filmed beautifully on 35mm film by DOP Darius Khondji, Z feels like it's come directly from films of old and Gray cares little when it comes to Hollywoodizing Fawcett's intriguing story, one that is more focused on one man's journey to prove his convictions right in the face of overwhelming odds and while the film takes detours to World War 1 and back to the green fields of England, Gray's tale is mostly centred around Hunnam and his arduous treks into the heart of the jungle and into the very heart of madness itself.After a string of rather mediocre big screen turns, it's great to see Hunnam shed his Sons of Anarchy persona to embody Fawcett's stoic determination and rock solid charisma and while ably supported by the likes of Robert Pattinson, Sienna Miller (in yet another low screen time turn) and Spider-Man himself Tom Holland, this really is the Hunnam and Gray show.No better displayed than when we're thrust deep into the dangerous and ominous Amazonian jungles, when Hunnam and Gray hit the waters and we go alongside them, Z's ability to transport us to this time and place is second to none. Which makes it a shame that Gray's film lacks a true emotional connection to pull us into this world even more.It's not easy pinpointing exactly why or how but despite Z's quality production and committed turns, Gray's film harbors a coldness to proceedings that makes it's supposedly emotionally charged human interactions and the films sombre end coda less impactful that one would've hoped.If Z had managed to connect us more to its emotional tics and the culmination of Fawcett's ambition that was edged forward no matter the cost to his personal wellbeing or family life, it's highly likely that this often impressive feat of filmmaking would've been more of an event it has ended up being.Final Say – There's a lot to like about The Lost City of Z and Gray's refreshingly old school approach to Fawcett's fascinating story should be commended but the films disappointment in the emotional connection stakes holds it back from discovering its true potential, despite Gray's best efforts and proof that Charlie Hunnam can in fact act.4 upset Peter Parker's out of 5",The Lost City of Z
28,TheMovieDiorama,The Lost City of Z explores the density of obsessive discovery shrouded in a jungle of abandonment.,8,17 September 2019,"Exploration. The yearning for discovery. To set foot where no man has ventured before. To excavate rarities that determine ancient civilisations. There's nothing quite like it. The addiction for reconnoitring. That overwhelming chase for glory in the ambitious overlay of cementing one's name in the history books. During my childhood, I desired to gain such credibility as an explorative scout. The inner Indiana Jones or Rick O'Connell within me, presenting film as a means of inspiration, screaming for adventure. Alas, working behind a desk will have to suffice, as Gray's portrayal of Amazonian fauna and flora proved to be devices for both the dangers of adventure and character self-destruction, in what is the most realistic depiction of exploration presented in film.Percy Fawcett, a young officer, is sent to the unknown Amazon jungle to map out the boundaries between two rivalling countries. His expedition proved fruitful, as he continually lusts to discover greater finds and prove the existence of an ancient civilisation. A jungle city covered in gold to which he describes as ""the lost city of Z"".First and foremost, Gray's illustrious biographical feature is a character study. Surveying a man corrupted by obsession, determination and compulsion. Selecting the option to risk his life discovering an ancient city, on multiple expeditions, as opposed to residing in England with his family fathering his newborn children. Representing the Amazon as a means of escape, Gray balances Fawcett's fanatic behaviour against his wife's abandonment with such infirmity that it instantly allows connectivity with each character. Nina's lust for her husband's safety and adventurous opportunities coincides with Percy's painful sacrifice of missing out on his children's adolescence. His unavailability scarring the mentality of his offspring, as they fail to grasp their father's longing for exploration.This isn't an outrageous adventure film where Percy is fleeing from an oncoming oversized boulder. Not even an action blockbuster where colonialism results in ""savages"" being viewed as antagonists. It's reality. Gray grounds the story and characters in realism, and rarely explores the route of fantastical ambiguity, with several scenes tackling societal issues. Fawcett's speech after his first expedition unravels the conflicting ideologies of what makes a society civilised, showcasing the narrow-minded viewpoints of RGS academics. Nina arguing with her husband for his misogynistic remarks in an attempt to level out equality. His son, Jack, reconciling and following the footsteps of his father, presenting the themes of respect and admiration. It's epic, both literarily and in scope.The extensive runtime is rarely noticeable, with only one or two segments slowing down the pace. The Battle of the Somme, just to further highlight Fawcett's lust for pride and provide reconciliation with his son, diminished the intent obsession for ""Z"", which consequently made the third and final expedition feel more like a holiday than an adventure. And that's really my only gripe. Gray expertly maintained the aura of compulsion for the first two expeditions but faltered at the last hurdle.However, the deliberate slow pace meticulously produced plenty of opportunities for cast and crew to display their talents. Hunnam gave a mesmerisingly commanding performance as the lead, although slightly lacked nuance in the calmer moments. His ferocity and thirst for adventure was truly infectious, as was Pattinson's role who yet again proved he is no longer the sparkly vampire of 'Twilight'. Miller and Holland, although lesser roles, had important scenes that were conveyed beautifully, affecting Fawcett's mentality in poetic ways. Khondji's cinematography was stunning. Emphasising the frivolous shades of yellow and green to complement the natural environment that these characters have embarked upon. And Spelman's score, shifting between uplifting and sentimental, portrayed Fawcett's conflicting interests euphorically. Technically, an astounding achievement that cements Gray's understanding of filmmaking.The slowness, despite not accessible for all audiences, works in Gray's favour. It coincides with Fawcett's gradual susceptibility to pride. And at its core, The Lost City of Z is a wondrously engaging character study. One that is eloquently performed, meticulously written and creatively constructed. A biographical adventure that, whilst set a century ago, seals its relevancy by exploring not just luscious jungles, but societal issues. A drama that, providing you put in the investment, may just quench your thirst for dangerous adventure. Just don't take James Murray with you...",The Lost City of Z

30,paul-allaer,Better than average explorer-adventure movie,7,22 April 2017,"""The Lost City of Z"" (2016 release from the UK; 141 min.) brings the true story of British explorer Percy Fawcett. As the movie opens, we are told it is ""Cork, Ireland, 1905"", and we get to know Major Fawcett and his wife Nina. Even though he wins the prestigious deer hunt event, he isn't highly regarded (""he choose the wrong ancestors"", sneers one). The next year, Fawcett is transferred to the Royal Geographical Society in London, and it isn't long before Fawcett is asked/offered the opportunity to settle a border dispute between Bolivia and Brazil. Off he goes, and the adventure of a lifetime awaits. At this point we're 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the big screen adaptation of the book of the same name, directed by James Gray (best known for his film ""The Immigrant"" a few years ago). Here, Gray gets the opportunity to bring an epic adventure to life. Indeed, once the story settles in South America, one cannot escape the gorgeous photography. But thankfully it's not just eye-candy, as the story telling is quite solid. In particular the second half of the movie soars, as we see what becomes of the quest for this legendary location. Along the way, we even get treated to a tough episode in WWI, shot with a veracity that rings true. Charlie Hunnam in the lead role of Percy Fawcett gets his meatiest role to date, and Sienna Miller is quite good as his wife Nina. But the big surprise is surely Robert Pattinson, unrecognizable as Fawcett's sidekick Henry Costin (it's only when I saw the end credits roll that I realized this was Pattinson). Last but not least, Christopher Spelman delivers a rousing orchestral score,""The Lost City of Z"" premiered last Fall at the New York Film Festival. It finally opened in theaters this weekend, I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, somewhat to my surprise. If you are in the mood for a better than average exploration adventure movie, I'd readily recommend you check out ""The Lost City of Z"", be it in theaters, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",The Lost City of Z
31,subxerogravity,"Interesting portrait of a man, indeed but as a movie it almost lost me.",7,15 April 2017,"It's one of those labor of loves it seems as the film felt like it was more interested in making an artistic narrative than it was about making money. I can respect that, but it was a boring movie for that reason. The Lost city of Z is about a British explorer named Percy Fawcett who while on a survey mission in the amazon discovers evidence that the ""savages"" once had a civilization the might even be older than the one he came from and spends his life trying to find it.I loved Charlie Hunnam in it. Hands down, his most grown up acting performance, and really made Fawcett a compelling man to follow. In fact the whole cast was impressive with Sienna Miller as Fawcett's wife and Robert Patterson who I totally did not recognize under the bread as Fawcett's most trusted companion on his trips. Tom Holland is also in the movie as Fawcett's oldest son who joins him on his last journey to the amazon. Other people gave great performances, but these are the ones I knew by name, making it a pretty stellar cast for me.While this movie does such a great job making Fawcett's life look fascinating,following him through his time with the army to his time as an explorer, I must admit that the slow burn of the narrative almost put me to sleep. It reminds me of another project Brad Pitt (who produced the movie) was evolved in, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. Though the Lost City of Z is not as painfully slow (Notice the tile is half that of the Jesse James movie), the combination of the quiet tone and it's speed was not something I wanted to sit in a movie theater and watch. It's not that the movie is long, it's that it feels long, and it feels like something that the movie does on purpose.I feel like the movie tries to gives us the realest accounts of a man's life as they can and I can respect that, but man, the two hours and thirty minutes this film comes in at was not easy at all to get through. That's just my warning.http://cinemagardens.com",The Lost City of Z

I'm not sure the reason, perhaps I'm craving an exotic adventure for myself. Whatever it is though it's got me watching every one of them I can find. I had been meaning to get around to 'The Lost City of Z' but the runtime of two hours 20 minutes had me a little bit sceptical. The pacing of a film with that length needs to impeccable otherwise it can drag on and become a real chore. I finally got around to seeing it though and what I discovered wasn't a bad film, but it certainly wasn't as enjoyable as I'd hoped for.I'd hoped for a film much more like 'Jungle' starring Daniel Radcliffe where they enter the jungle, the action begins and then never lets up. Instead I found it a very frustrating and choppy film. Every time the action was just starting to begin they'd suddenly cut back to civilisation with them out of the jungle and the boring set up nonsense would start again. The film is undoubtedly at its strongest when it is set in the jungle.It sounds like there was a hell of a lot of adversity during the shoot. I commend the cast and crew for committing to actually film in the jungle. It sounds like it was bloody awful at times. There's some very strong dialogue throughout the movie that helps pave over a lot of the cracks. There are unquestionably better jungle set movies out there that I would recommend checking out before this one.",The Lost City of Z
33,alindsay-al,An above average true story,6,29 March 2017,"After being made to watch the trailer for this film a few times before other films I actually had some interest in the lost city of z and this film is alright but I don't really care if I ever watch it again. The premise of the film sees an explorer go on an adventure to find a lost city in the amazon. Charlie Hunnam plays the explorer in this film and he does a great job in this film, at first I thought he was a little stoic but he really grows as the film progresses. He brings a lot of passion an humanity to his character and you do care about him and his family situation. Robert pattinson from the twilight franchise is in this film and he was really good as well, I really liked the friendship that builds between him and hunnam and bought it. Sienna miller plays hunnam's wife in this film and I thought she was a strong character and her chemistry with hunnam was really good. Tom Holland who is the new spider man is in this film and he does a really good job especially when you consider that he is still a young man. Also it is great to see ian McDiarmid who Is the emperor in the star wars franchise in a film again. The story is easily the weakest part of this film, it follows this guy and really his obsession with finding this city without really good motivation. You never fully care about him finding the city and this film goes through a lot of side plots that just aren't focused or interesting enough for you to care. The script of the film has some great dramatic monologues and dialogue that does help make you care about the performance's. However, this film is a complete humourless affair and it does hurt the film as there isn't really a moment to relax. The style of the film has some decent action scenes in it and some great cinematography. But it has severe pacing issues, as mentioned before the film attempts to much and it makes this film a rather boring affair.

British explorer Percy Fawcett did put all those secondary to his long duration adventures into the depth of the Amazon in the 1920s. Much to the chagrin of his wife and kids as well as to the mockery of many of his fellow peers. Perhaps he was driven to succeed in reclaiming the social status of his family name that had been downgraded as well as his passion for adventure. While the movie had quality cinematography and stellar settings, it felt a bit choppy as time passed and many characters' emotions took 180 degree turns without any explanation aside from the passage of time. Seeing why specific feelings changed would have ratcheted up the drama and better tied together the various periods of time. Of course, the big question is will he discover a new civilization?

35,aharmas,A Sense of Wonder,9,14 April 2017,"""The Lost City of Z"" tells the story of a soldier, a man who lives to explore, to discover, to make a name of himself in a world that has started to suffocate him because of the restrictions it places upon him and his family. One day he's presented with the opportunity to find a ""lost city"", a place full on wonder and riches, something that will make him famous and allow him to recover his family's good name.Soon, he's in Bolivia, finds his way into Amazonia, and with the help of a native, he reaches the end of a river. There he finds some old pottery artifacts, which plant the idea that something lies hidden in the jungle, the remnants of a civilization that according to legend was far more advanced than anything he has found in the jungle. However, he must turn around and plan a return trip, with more resources and more funding.Convincing his countrymen proves to be more difficult, but with the help of his wife and an antique document that might be evidence of the existence of the lost city, he finds his way back to the jungle, getting closer to his goal. Unfortunately not everything works out as he expected, and the second trip becomes a missed opportunity. When he returns, he has to confront members of the Royal Geographical Society because of a decision he made during the trip. He makes it clear he will go back, but he's delayed once again when he goes to fight for England in World War I.Many years have passed since his original trip, and this time he's joined by his own son, financed both by the Americans and the British. He wanders deeper into the jungle, only to run into other tribes he hasn't seen before. There is some speculation as to what really happen here, but he disappears and never heard from again until an object shows up back in England, and it's the only connection left to the explorer.There is an epic feel to the movie, to the way both worlds are presented in their majesty. The British world with its luxuries and civilization with its rigidity and the class divisions, and the new world, full of mysteries, opportunities, and dangers. It's a world that charms and frightens, with such power and plenty of darkness, with the lure of promises that might or might never come true.The picture is a representation of what the establishment is, and how societies change because of different reasons. One can have plans, but it doesn't mean that they will always be fully realized.",The Lost City of Z
36,questl-18592,The Lost City of Prime,8,19 March 2020,"What a wonderful surprise treat. I had heard this was a good movie but beyond that and the fact that it's based on a true story, I knew next to nothing. Wonderful performances all around, obviously Hunnam is center stage here and he's great but I feel like Pattinson and, to an extent, Holland steal the show.A movie like this is hard to pull off, I feel. It would be so easy to add unnecessary spectacle, to turn the lead into a hero, to amp things up to 11 or shove in some Hollywood's stereotypes. It never stops to that though and instead we get a relatively even handed look at a flawed man with an obsession that dominates his life and the people around him that have to navigate it all.Unfortunately, I think it starts to flounder in the third act. The focus is gone and suddenly we're bouncing all over with sudden character movements that, maybe they're not completely unfounded but they feel rushed. It's as if they made it through the first two hours and suddenly remembered they needed an ending. That's probably unfair of me, because I do still really enjoy this but I couldn't help but notice how the slow, explorative tale suddenly switched gears.Still, it's an excellent movie. Is available on Prime, so it's highly accessible. Absolutely give it a shot if you have the chance.",The Lost City of Z

Charlie Hunnam gives a riveting performance as the driven explorer working to prove himself to his peers (he's a military officer who'd never seen combat), working to restore his family's good name after being disgraced by his father, and working to financially provide for his family. There have been many masterfully made films about explorers, but I was most taken with how ""The Lost City of Z"" was a near perfect blend of old fashioned Rudyard Kipling type of adventure story while also tapping into the likes of Werner Herzog's ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God,"" unafraid of delving into Fawcett's obsession and creating a haunting, hallucinatory film experience. Gorgeously photographed by Darius Khondji (""Se7ven,"" ""Delicatessen,"" ""The Beach,"" and many more), the film is worth watching for the location photography alone. What I think held this film back from being a masterpiece is that although it was at once a ripping old fashioned adventure film and also a smart meditation on obsession and escaping one's past, it never quite goes deep enough into either. It never goes as far as ""Aguirre"" or ""Apocalypse Now"" into it's heart of darkness, and it never fully embraces it's Edgar Rice Burroughs inner heart. Still, it's an ambitious film and Hunnam terrific in the lead, as is Sienna Miller as Fawcett's loyal wife who only sees him between expeditions. Overall, writer/director James Gray has made something unique and fascinating, which made me want to go back and look at some of his previous films, which I seem to recall being interesting, but also mixed bags.",The Lost City of Z

42,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"Disjointed, episodic, also uneven and overlong, filled with peaks and valleys.",6,30 April 2017,"Screenplay jumps from one segment of Fawcett's life to another, without a lot of connexion.I didn't really object to this film's two and a half hours long run time, I just wish more time would have been spent in the jungles, searching for the lost city, because when they're in the jungles, the film works well, as unseen natives launch arrows at them, and their rocky trip through some rapids, and the film is well worth watching for those scenes. More of the screenstory should have dealt with this, as well as the jungle natives themselves.Instead, the first fifteen minutes are unrelated hunting stories, and it later veers off into feminist ramblings for one lengthy scene, and a completely out of place, and needless sequence on a WWI battlefield, which seems to occupy about fifteen minutes of the run time as well, and for what purpose? It seems like the filmmakers had abandoned the premise of searching for a lost city, and padded the plot out with these scenes, and as a result, the search for a lost city only makes up about 40% of the movie. There are occasional questions of whether the explorers are more savage than the natives, but even that doesn't seem to go anywhere, as the film will quickly go off into a different direction.This is (or should be, anyway) a film where its setting and location should become a character in its own right (like the jungles in Predator, or the building in Die Hard, or the hotel in The Shining) but we see so little of it that it could just simply be an overgrown section of land in Hawai'i.",The Lost City of Z
43,bkrauser-81-311064,Cartographers Have it Hard,7,7 May 2017,"Living in a world informed nearly every millisecond by GPS can make the life and times of Percy Fawcett a bit hard to fathom. Especially when you consider that the last small segments of the world supposedly unseen by modern man, were explored just as the First World War began. The Amazon Rainforest was once described derisively as the ""green desert"". A land so inhospitable that those who ventured in were never heard from again. To Fawcett however, the rainforest was where he would plant his flag as it were.Why learn from the natives when we can just shoot the natives! The Lost City of Z tells the true-ish story of Fawcett's (Hunnam) exhaustive search for remnants of an ancient civilization hidden deep within the jungles of Brazil and Bolivia. At the time, his theories and archaeological finds were met with considerable ridicule - a scene even recreates a sample of that ridicule with a House of Parliament-type roasting at the Royal Geographical Society. Yet despite multiple professional and personal setbacks, Fawcett managed expedition after expedition entrancing the world with fascinating stories of rugged deep-jungle adventuring.Fawcett was partially the inspiration for Indiana Jones and it's easy to see the resemblance. Charlie Hunnam plays him with an understated charm that belies a lifetime of hard-fought, real-world wisdom. He's a glory-seeker sure, but he's the kind you'd want around in a pinch if for no other reason than he'll share the credit.Yet the movie often feels at odds with the character. Director James Gray has steadily built a reputation for making deliberately paced classically pure films that use old-fashioned sensibilities of style and melodrama. The Lost City of Z is certainly no exception having the same restraint as The Immigrant (2013) while never skimping on the savory, visceral bits that come with jungle exploration. At its height, you can almost feel the muck and sticky air cake around you.Call me a cynic but when a movie's mis en scene knowingly channels Aguirre (1972) while the star channels good 'ol Indie, it becomes very hard to peg a movie like this down. Sometimes it feels like Hunnam's star-like quality is threatening to torpedo the film, while other times it feels like the movie is a pip-pip-cheerio away from going awry. It never does, but because of the movie's pacing, it's easy to get your mind worked up about something else.The film also doesn't seem to know what to do with its third (or I would argue fourth) act. We get a satisfactory character arc complete with a heartfelt family reunion and what probably amounts to British fanfare. Then the movie kind of keeps going on for another twenty minutes. It's not to tie up loose ends mind you, but rather to setup something thematically new then leaves you with the bag.Despite its fault however, The Lost City of Z remains a fine film whose pedigree deserves to be recognized if not loved by archeologists, cartographers and fans of Arthur Conan Doyle. To modern, casual filmgoers however, The Lost City of Z might feel a little too constrained and for reasons that don't justify the pomp and circumstance.",The Lost City of Z
44,shakercoola,An enticing quest but without clear narrative focus,6,11 March 2019,"An American biographical adventure; A story about a man who journeys into the Amazon at the dawn of the 20th century and discovers evidence of a previously unknown, advanced civilization that may have once inhabited the region. He was aiming for a city he called 'Z'. It's a film which hearkens back to classic exploration epics of the mid 20th Century. Charlie Hunnam gives a well measured performance as the British geographer, Army Major, and explorer Percy Fawcett. The film centres on passion and determination and obsession and escape but also the losses suffered by leaving the home - his growing family and dutiful wife - in service of fantastical dreams. It is a biopic by numbers and this is a troublesome area because Fawcett and his story have many critics. Nonetheless it is a stately adventure despite the slow pacing.",The Lost City of Z
45,tomsview,What happened to the snake?,7,29 November 2017,"Percy Fawcett was one those British explorers we learnt about at school back in the 1950's, but nearly all the illustrations of his trips into the Amazon showed his encounter with a 62-foot anaconda. I waited for it, but it was a no-show.It could have given the film a boost especially after all those sessions at the starchy Royal Geographical Society. However we do get piranhas. ""The Lost City of Z"" is an interesting film more than a riveting one. Like the book by David Grann, the story is one long frustrating search. Fawcett, played in the film by Charlie Hunnam, was a driven man who was the first European to explore vast areas of the Amazon and South America. But his search for a lost civilisation deep in the Amazon jungle became a life-long obsession.He seemed more of an eccentric in Glann's book although in the movie you have to wonder what was going on in old Percy's head when he leaves Sienna Miller behind in England for years at a time. She plays Mrs Fawcett and although we don't have a giant snake to lift the film, we do have her.This film is beautifully photographed with authentic looking scenes and Indians. Obviously it wasn't an easy film to make, however, the various journeys are somewhat hard to follow. The film avoids old-fashioned narration but it may have helped us navigate our way a little more easily.The story takes a side trip to WW1, but like much else in the story it gives us yet more doom, gloom and mud.Eventually Percy heads back into the Amazon one last time with his eldest son; the product of one of his trips back to England. However just like Captain Cook on his last journey, Percy misreads the natives with unpleasant consequences.Films about explorers tend to be a bit glacial. This film is similar to 1990's ""Mountains of the Moon"" and in both cases the books they were based on gave context and detail, while the movies struggled to be as cohesive.With that said, this film does give a very believable feeling for the times. If you can get your heart rate in sync with the ""Merchant Ivory"" pace of the film then there is much to admire - even if they didn't bother with the snake.",The Lost City of Z
46,krocheav,The Lost City of Z - Offers Much to Contemplate,8,9 June 2018,"Director/Producer/Writer James Gray certainly takes on complex subjects - giving himself some difficult tasks as well as a challenge for his distributors. As with his lushly detailed 'The Immigrant' in'13, 'The Lost City of Z' presents us with a series of dazzling images from prolific director of photography Darius Khondji, to grace this haunting, factual, unsolved expedition into the jungles of Peru. The title (while accurate) may be an unwise choice as it suggests a silly Indiana Jones type adventure yarn - and that, this high quality, serious, movie is defiantly not. This feeling can be picked up through the tone of some unkind viewer comments from those only wanting cheap action fiction. Superb locations, performances, and a lush music score all contribute to an engaging cinema experience. While the movie is quite longish (though, fully sustained) one curious problem re-occurs in several sections - that the film looks as it may have been edited from a longer narrative via pre or post-production cuts. If this were the case then it would explain some odd continuity gaps tending to leave the viewer to fathom out some unexplained time shifts. Otherwise, it's always compelling and offers totally professional production values to recommend it to the discerning viewer.",The Lost City of Z
47,Foutainoflife,Somewhat Disappointing,6,6 October 2018,"This movie is a nice look at Fawcett but it failed to deliver much entertainment.

48,arungeorge13,Slow-paced but well-directed biography! [+71%],7,17 July 2017,"If not anything else, James Gray's 'The Lost City of Z' based on David Grann's non-fiction book of the same name will make you look up the life-history of British explorer Percy Fawcett and what led to his disappearance while in pursuit of unraveling the secrets behind the existence of an early civilization in the Amazonian jungle.This is most likely Charlie Hunnam's career-best performance, ably supported by Sienna Miller, Robert Pattinson and Tom Holland. A sense of poignancy pervades all through the film, even when Percy returns from his first few Amazonian expeditions in one piece. One keeps getting the feeling that there is something even grander to follow. The film unfurls at snail-pace, which might seem off-putting for certain viewers. The intimacy between Percy and his wife Nina is a beautifully-painted portrait. However, there are scenes that don't fit into the investigative tone of the film (especially the WW I scene, that barely adds anything except how it leads to the reconciliation between Percy and his eldest son Jack). The movie does suffer from a few shortcomings other than the pace such as its wistful effort in trying to bind the elements of jungle adventure and character-driven drama, which does not always work in favor of the film. Certain scenes could have been processed better or avoided. Nonetheless, this is a film with its heart in the right place and is mostly able to hold Percy Fawcett's name up high, in the books of history. Some subtle cinematography work from Darius Khondji, employing the right kind of filters based on setting, is one of the film's strong- points. Viewers who are familiar with James Gray's dilatory mode of story-telling will be able to gloat over 'The Lost City of Z' a great deal.Verdict: Lengthy but whole-hearted!",The Lost City of Z
49,pyrocitor,"Welcome to the Jungle, we got no fun or games",5,20 May 2017,"Percival Fawcett - intrepid explorer, whose exploits into charting the Amazon jungle in search of a mystical ancient civilization captivated the world and inspired a generation of adventure writers - would probably fall asleep during his own dour, flaccid biopic. Now, this isn't to say the only way to cinematically interpret Fawcett's life would be to whip-crack into full-blown Indiana Jones (though a film this allergic to fun could do far worse than shallow, Romancing the Stone mimesis). Instead, director James Gray strives to tap into Fawcett's mythos and mystique with the lyrical, abstract profundity of a Terrence Malick or Werner Herzog (indeed, his telling is irreconcilably indebted to Herzog's own parable of jungle madness, Fitzcarraldo). Sadly, he's too clumsy a director to commit to the kooky poetry of his thematic earmarks. Instead, his lolling sequences of Fawcett's crew wandering through the jungle or circumnavigating stuffy British Geographical Society politics - amazingly, equally drab and aimless - at times pleasantly hypnotic, but threaten to turn proceedings into The Lost City of ZZZzzzzzz. Fawcett's memoirs tell of encounters with 60 foot snakes, deadly spiders, and enough peril and adventure to galvanize Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to write The Lost World. These tales may have been tall (who's to say? are YOU going to forage through the jungle to fact check?), but it's a rare exercise in cinema purposefully downplaying the fun factor of its source material. The film starts promisingly: after an effectively squirmy opening with Fawcett failing to advance through the ranks of claustrophobic military culture in rural Ireland thanks to disgraced parentage, Gray bequeaths us a fun Ian McDarmid cameo as the evil Emperor of Geography, whose ominous monologue hypes the exotic perils of the jungle, stopping just shy of him purring ""Goooood. Goooooood!"" So far so good (gooooood!). But, after a thrilling (not) foray into the fine details of cartography, we finally follow Fawcett into the jungle. And wait. And walk. And wait. And cough. And fidget. And try not to check our phones, but my goodness, is that the time? But don't worry: you've two hours of more of the same awaiting you. (I could tell, as a Canadian viewer, that my crowing this triumphantly at hearing the titular legend correctly[!] pronounced as 'Zed' rather than the customary big-screen 'Zee,' was a sign of how dire the cinematic experience was here )One brief sequence, where Fawcett's raft and crew are besieged by indigenous arrows, only to meet a bloody end by looming piranhas, plays as a lively prelude to more thrilling adventures to come. Instead, it's the activity high point, an uneasily early climax paving the way to two thirds of increasingly diminishing content. There's no facts, literature, or even conjecture to establish even the skeleton of a mythology enough to share Fawcett's burning desire to unearth the titular lost civilization, apart from a few nonchalant shards of pottery, quickly whisked away from. Instead, we're reminded that the film shares a production team with 12 Years a Slave, and is thereby a Film With an Important Social Message. Behold: lengthy, awkward, anachronistic shoehorned-in diatribes shooting for feminism and anti-colonial racial equality instead playing as Hallmark pandering, patronizing asides of white saviourism. Think of Brad Pitt's uncomfortably didactic, self-congratulatory monologue in 12 Years a Slave. Now imagine sinking into a full 30 minutes of it, in a film that really isn't an organic platform for filmic slacktivism du jour. Yeah, I saw you checking your watch there - don't even pretend. Even such a feeble ebb of a film could have coughed up some embers with an appropriately charismatic, magnetic lead. Unfortunately, Charlie Hunnam is effectively the antithesis of any such qualities. If his cross between snoozy murmuring, overcooked pontificating, and absentminded smugness were meant to play as enigmatic, he clearly dropped out of Mumblecore college too early to find a balance skewing anything close to watchable. If anything, Robert Pattinson appears to be practically bursting at the seams to chew scenery as eccentric comic relief with deranged relish - so, naturally, after an encouragingly wild-eyed introduction, he's rendered effectively mute by Gray, his performance as much of a dud as his surroundings. Sienna Miller is similarly too swamped by the script's quicksand of 'frowny, long-suffering wife with absentee husband' cliché to cough up anything resembling a spark of humanity to grab onto. So we're left with Tom Holland, funnelling every ounce of sprightly energy, charisma, and irresistible earnestness into Fawcett's son-with-prodigal-father, heralding the film's only genuine character arc. Try as he might, he's barely in it. It isn't enough. Gray's film is not entirely without minor blips of enjoyment: it's well-shot, and makes good use of the beautiful Amazonian scenery (even if it is all dulled by a frustrating grey filter - there's really no need to live up to your namesake literally, James). Add the serene, soothingly ethereal score of Christopher Spelman, and many of Fawcett's jungle walks attain a pleasantly elegiac peacefulness, like a meditative nature walk. It's just a shame that this is the extent of the film's ambitions, as we otherwise see next to nothing of the excitement, mystery, or peril that made the jungle so obsessively captivating for Fawcett, instead making each jungle reprise, instead of bustling with possibility, at most muster a murmur of placid indifference. The Lost City of Z may be benignly, mildly engaging, but, remains overall, like Fawcett, a promising curiosity fated to be buried in the annals of cinema history. So, if that feat of metatextual anticlimax was Gray's aim, he accomplished it masterfully - the only such instance of mastery throughout. Oh - are you still awake? You're doing better than me.

During this trip, he discovers signs that indicate the possibility of a lost civilization. This causes a fascination that draws him to discover more about the region.The film and its main performer have a few things in common: they are both visually attractive but their respective depths are each just slightly above average. One would expect more from a film of two hours and twenty minutes. There isn't anything necessarily flawed in the film. There are just moments when one wants it to go further.The cinematography by Darius Khondji is stunning and the main draw for this film.

Charlie Hunnam was great as a m/c thug, but he clearly isn't suited to play a British gentleman at the turn of the 20th Century. His accent comes and goes, but it's his non-verbal behavior that betrays the 21st Century. His co-star Sienna Miller (playing his wife) is wonderful, but the film is almost exclusively HunnamThen there is the directing. The film fails to give us any feeling for the enormous undertakings, the claustrophobia of the jungle, and the hardships of the journey. Just about the time you might get a sense of it, the director cuts away. Weeks are conveyed in seconds, and years in minutes. You couldn't do a worse job with actually trying.The editing is a problem too.

Probably not as accurate as it could be both in script and content this film still had something about it which didn't offend me too much, and allowed me to get to the end of the film without too much trouble or anger. There wasn't as much depth to the film as I would have liked, I came away from the film having not learned much - it seemed to be just a vehicle to say 'hey look, there was this explorer dude who lived during times of conflict, and he managed to find things that other people couldn't and wouldn't'. It was beautiful looking film and maybe that, coupled with the delivery that Hunnam and Pattison brought that allowed me to just switch off and keep watching things unfold. I have to say, I'm not a fan of Hunnam or Pattison (or Miller either for that matter), I think they are unproven and over-hyped -but they actually delivered decent performances which didn't have me shouting at the screen, and at times made me root for their success. That's probably high praise, because the script they were working from was fairly bland, predictable and none engaging. This is a long film so if you do want to give it a try prepare for a numb bum - oh, and prepare for an ending that leaves more questions than answers.I'll give this 4 out of 10.

54,rockman182,The Lost Ciity of Z (2017),7,28 June 2017,"This film kind of crept on me but when I found out what it was about, I was interested. The expedition and mysterious disappearance of Percy Fawcett was curious upon reading about it, and I wanted to check out and learn more about his life leading up to that. I really liked The Immigrant by James Gray, especially because of a stellar showing by a very talented Marion Cotillard. I didn't expect sensational performances here (not a big fan of Charlie Hunnam based on what I've seen). I've heard critics rave about this film but I was feeling 'eh' about what I saw.As mentioned earlier the film is about the life of Percy Fawcett, starting off with his early expeditions and gradual progression and obsession with a lost city of 'Z' that he has heard of from a local. The film progresses and portrays different moments of his life, leading up to his final expedition where he disappeared with his son. The film has some really great looking scenes. The sunsets, the jungles and the aerial views look fantastic. The scene with the dark jungle and river with lights is absolutely gorgeous.While the film often looked beautiful, I felt like the writing of the film wasn't always sharp. With a biopic (especially one with a larger scope) its important to avoid skipping over crucial periods. This film jumps forward quite a bit so you kind of lose a bit of development and intrigue in what goes on. The film is overlong, which isn't exactly a problem if the film remains engaging throughout but that is not what happens in this case. The film needed a bit more urgency and you could tell that the film was padded.I haven't seen Hunnam in Sons of Anarchy but I have never been impressed with him in film. Its the same here. He lacks charisma and just seems to be a straight laced man that's going through the motions. In contrast, Siena Miller was excellent, very underrated performer. This is also a cool look into seeing future Spider-Man, Tom Holland. Even Robert Pattinson was decent. I'm not sold on Hunnam as a leading man, which is why I have no urgency to check out the new King Arthur film.I thought the final expedition and the re-imagining of it was strong and evoking. I wish that could be stated for the rest of the acts of the film. I was hoping to get a lot more out of this film. Its not bad but its just not something that fulfilled its potential. There's a certain something to the pictures of James Gray though; an alluring element. I'd still be interested to see what he can do in the future.6.5/10",The Lost City of Z
55,dave-mcclain,"""The Lost City of Z"" is a slow-moving, but engaging historical epic.",7,21 April 2017,"Percival Harrison Fawcett. Probably the most famous explorer you've never heard of. A more recent explorer (from only about 100 years ago) than those we learned about in school, he was in search of some of the same places as the explorers of old. Fawcett, a British army officer who had studied geography and cartography, became obsessed with the search for an ancient Amazonian city that he called ""Z"". 16th century explorers called it ""El Dorado"", a mythical city of gold which is said to have existed deep in the jungle of present-day Brazil. The Spanish conquistadors searched for El Dorado, as did the famed English explorer and ""New World"" colonizer Sir Walter Raleigh. In a tragic irony of history, the Europeans' diseases (to which the natives had no immunity) probably wiped out the indigenous civilization for which they searched. Over three centuries later, Fawcett was looking for the remains of ancient peoples in the Amazon – not to find riches, but rather, to add to the ""civilized"" world's understanding of and appreciation for the peoples that most of his contemporaries still referred to as ""savages"". Fawcett's expeditions deep into the jungles of central South America inspired the creation of fictional characters ranging from Sherlock Holmes' creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Professor Challenger (in his 1912 novel ""The Lost World"", about dinosaurs living in the Amazon basin) to George Lucas' Indiana Jones (portrayed by Harrison Ford in several movies directed by Steven Spielberg). In 2005, David Grann, a staff writer for ""The New Yorker"", personally visited a native tribe in the Amazon researching Fawcett's expeditions. Grann turned his resulting article into an award-winning best-selling 2009 book which, in turn, became the 2017 film of the same name, ""The Lost City of Z"" (PG-13, 2:21).Major Percy Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam, from TV's ""Sons of Anarchy"") is a good man with a complicated family situation. He's unable to earn his due credit in his career in the British Army because, as one so-called ""gentleman"" puts it, ""He's been rather unfortunate in his choice of ancestors,"" which is a reference to the character of Fawcett's late father. Percy is also the head of his own growing family (yes, head of the household – it's 1906, after all). His wife, Nina (Sienna Miller) is an independent-minded woman (especially for her time) and Percy respects her, but her desire to become involved with her husband's career is rebuffed (by Percy and others) on account of her gender. Nina is relegated to the role of primary caregiver of their growing family, including their son, Jack (and, later, Brian and Joan). Nina values her role, but it's harder due to Percy's lengthy absences, which cause resentment from Jack (once, as a boy, asking, ""Are you my father?"" and, later, as a teen, proclaiming his hatred of his dad).After completing the latest of his postings outside of England proper, he is called home for a special mission. The Royal Geographic Society wants him to draw upon his earlier training as a surveyor to go into the Amazon and help settle a border dispute between Brazil and Bolivia. A successful mission could help avoid a war between those two countries, help insure the continued success of his country's rubber trade in the region, bring him some decorations for his unadorned uniform and help restore honor to his family name. In short, the RGS makes him an offer that he can't refuse. And, even though it means going into a dangerous place (what with the lack of personnel support, uncharted terrain, harsh jungle conditions, diseases, wild animals and unfriendly natives) and being away from his family for two or three years (IF he even comes back), Percy accepts the assignment and Nina supports him doing so.While in the jungle, Percy's native guide tells him about an ancient city that he says is nearby. With the help of fellow (and more experienced) explorer Henry Costin (Robert Pattinson) and other members of his party (including one named Arthur, played by Edward Ashley), Percy completes his assigned mission – and also finds well-made pieces of ancient pottery. Percy returns home to a hero's welcome, but he quickly alienates the scientific community which was cheering him on when he makes a speech proclaiming that he was close to finding evidence of a sophisticated Native American civilization that may predate their own. But then, with the support (and company) of a wealthy gentleman named James Murray (Angus Macfadyen), who fancies himself an explorer, Percy, Henry and Arthur head back to South America. A combination of run-ins with the natives, Murray's lack of intestinal fortitude, the beginning of World War I and other factors complicate and delay Percy realizing his ultimate goal, but he keeps trying and is ultimately joined by his son, Jack (played as a young man by Tom Holland). And then my summary ends. I'll reveal none of the movie's surprises. For the rest of the story, you can read up on the history of Percival Fawcett and his search, or, better yet, see the film. Here's why you should ""The Lost City of Z"" is a slow-moving, but engaging historical epic. Little-known writer/director James Gray (""The Immigrant"", ""We Own the Night"", ""Little Odessa"") tells this little-known story very well. He does a great job of humanizing Fawcett's adventures and distilling them to their most important elements, creating an enlightening and entertaining film in the process. Gray also lays out the plot in a way that makes it relevant to current social and political issues, without preaching. Strong performances by Hunnam, Miller and the rest of the cast help Gray's cause. The film's energy sometimes wanes, but the journey is worth your time. ""B+""",The Lost City of Z

From the dull performance and stiff delivery of the lead character as he tried too hard to do the accent, to the unimpressive cinematography and locations, this was nowhere near as entertaining as it should have been. And it wasn't like it was without budget. The WW1 scenes and the UK period crowd scenes couldn't have been cheap and easy to stage, so why not plow the same effort into the jungle scenes, where the whole point of the wonder and awe of the story is about? They actually went to the Jungle, why not find some decent shots while you're there? Robert Patterson did deliver a good performance, and the last 20 mins was halfway decent possibly just because the mood was set as mysterious and disorientating via some finally decent music choices. There were quite a few cliché clunker lines and dilemmas in the film, you know the sort of thing, class issues, gender stereotypes, war pep talks, my eyes rolled every time one came along and it added to my non enjoyment of the film. We expect more in modern cinema. Overall the story just wasn't told that well. Things that could have been dramatic were delivered in confusing ways and just sailed off having left no mark.

James Gray wrote the screenplay and directed the film that tells the story of Percy Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam). Percy is introduced languishing with a bad legacy of his father and an unrecognized military rank of Major though he shows exception at hunting shooting a large deer in Cork, Ireland. He is transferred to the Royal Geographical Society and given an opportunity to redeem his father's troubled legacy by traveling to the Amazon.His wife Nina (Sienna Miller) is not happy about his extended absence but agrees to raise their two sons without him. On his first trip out, he is accompanied by Henry Costin (Robert Pattinson) and commissioned to map the river to help prevent conflict between Brazil and Bogota. He witnesses the slave trade of the natives and the disrespect societies have for these isolated civilizations. The trip up the river is deadly for many of his crew but Fawcett and Costin make it to the source with the help of a native who escapes. Percy finds pottery and becomes convinced there is a lost city, which he names Zed. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",The Lost City of Z

He makes several journeys to Brazil before going missing.This kind of Boy's Own type of adventure may at times seem as though it's all been done before, but it doesn't do the Indiana Jones bit and tends to go on a more mysterious path by highlighting Hunnam's Percy Fawcett character who is a more fragile individual who creates family conflicts due to his increasingly obsessive quest. Now a forgotten character, Percy Fawcett was nevertheless a well known figure at the time.Maybe a stronger character would have been able to do more with the role, but the production values are very good in this interesting story about an interesting character, despite its moments of dullness.",The Lost City of Z
59,brankovranjkovic,Overlong and Hard to Get Through,5,28 March 2017,"This is a film about exploration, about class structure, about being able to fit in, and about success and failure. The protagonist (Percy Fawcett) has a tainted reputation due to his father being a drunk and a gambler. Percy is a military officer who is offered an assignment to chart the Amazon and particularly the area around Bolivia where rubber production was the most lucrative industry, we learn there was a dispute over the position of the border, charting the area would avert a war between the rubber producers. He accepts the mission in an attempt to repair his family name and restore some reputation. This film challenges the belief that Western Civilisation was the first to be established. Percy flits between jolly 'Old Blighty' and the Amazon several times to continue his obsessive search for this civilisation.It's hard to believe that he leaves his wife pregnant before leaving for every 3-4 year long expedition, she shows an incredible level of personal sacrifice. It might have been a good idea to have explored her character in more depth. The film really irritated me because Percy was an absent parent, his eldest son had a justifiable hate / love relationship with him which seemed to miraculously improve from one scene to the next without any stimulus. There could have been more dramatic filming of the jungle areas. Scenery around the Amazon should be easy to photograph, although we see far too little of this or the atmosphere.This could have been a more fascinating epic. Although I really like true stories, this was extremely long and dull. A viewer at the end of my row actually fell asleep within the first 30minutes and remained that way for the majority of the rest. Not a bad film but overlong and ultimately irritating (for me).",The Lost City of Z

I dived into any true adventure story and yearned to see big screen epics of these remarkable stories. So thank you James Gray for turning the incredible story of Perry Fawcett into film!This film really felt like they were trying to remain as faithful as possible to the Fawcett story while cramming as many events in. Sure it can move a little slowly at times, but ultimately I found it quite captivating and found myself drawn into this man's dogged pursuit of a dream.The lighting was a bit too dark at times (plenty of shadows, indistinguishable faces, lots of fire glows) - but I guess these kind of things are part of trekking thru a jungle. The jungle was definitely made to feel suffocating.Was great seeing Charlie Hunman in a role outside of 'Sons of Anarchy'. I also really enjoyed the 'old time' feel of it - the style of storytelling and orchestral music especially.

While at times it feels like an ordinary biopic following the events of Fawcett's life and justifying his lifelong belief that there was a native city and civilization in the Amazon, it often was more focused on broader cultural ideals, particularly in that time period. It's very well directed, with scenes clearly showing the resistance Fawcett faced in a more traditional time period. The script doesn't give Hunnam as much room as I'd like to express his intensity and passion for exploration and success, but his performance was nevertheless extremely strong. His relentless attitude in the jungle while being reasonable towards Murray was very well executed. The cinematography was also one of the biggest strengths, especially the jungle scenes which conveyed the uncertainty of what was out there and constant fear, even if the script didn't show the depth of danger of the Amazon as the book did. One of the elements that didn't emotionally connect was the reconciliation between Jack and Percy - in the hospital scene, with no dialogue Jack goes from being disgusted at Percy's promotion to colonel to hugging and idolizing him? The ending was necessary in terms of the truth of what happened, but was anticlimactic in the lifelong journey we had seen Fawcett go on.

65,CineMuseFilms,a solid tale made lacklustre in the telling,6,28 August 2017,"Deceptive titles might improve box office but they do little for a film's integrity. The Lost City of Z (2017) will no doubt attract audiences with the prospect of a lost antiquity but that is not what this film is about. It's a true story based on an ego-driven British explorer who is obsessed with finding an ancient civilisation so he can restore honour to his family name.Set in 1905, the storyline covers an epic quarter of a century in several bold leaps of time and place. Percy Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam) struggles for advancement as a British officer because his gambling and boozing father brought disgrace to the family name. When given an opportunity to map the Amazon rainforest Percy leaves his pregnant wife Nina (Sienna Miller), knowing it might take years, all for the hope of personal glory. During the expedition, he learns of a lost ancient city full of untold riches but is forced to return to England before he can investigate. While British scientists scoff at the notion of a lost civilisation he is soon back in the Amazon, this time to find the lost city he calls 'Z'. Forced again to abandon the expedition, the cycle is repeated many years later when he sets off for the Amazon with his now young adult son.Despite having high production values, this film is an interesting example of thematic incoherence. Put simply: it does not know what it wants to be. It mixes an old-fashioned adventure tale with romantic melodrama, historical biography, thriller, period drama, with a World War I movie thrown in for good measure. The narrative arc is repetitive and the timeframe leaps are jarring. There are just so many times one can endure the sight of explorers encountering the same dangers and similar outcomes. The cinematography is magnificent but does not offset the trite dialogue and contrived skirmishes with Amazon natives and the British establishment. At times the dangers of exploring the Amazon appear as arduous as a weekend scouting camp except for the implausible moment when Percy stands tall under a shower of native spears shielded only by his journal. The colonial supremacy and the 'all-men-are-equal' themes are laboured to the point of lecturing, and the script at times falls through the floor, like when Nina farewells a son she may never see again with the words ""have fun"". The main actors seem to play their stereotypes rather than express their roles with nuance and authenticity, and the relationship between Percy and Nina is meant to be foundational but conveys as plastic. While the film's title promises excitement, the meandering story keeps disappointing so that by the end one doesn't really care if the city existed or not.Of course, British filmmakers are excellent in depicting the snobbishness of their society and this is a highlight of the film. The attempt to include moral discourse on British colonialism and feminism is tokenistic, but it does provide some insight into the ideas and attitudes that prevailed early last century. Some will find this uneven film engaging while others will welcome the credits when they arrive after what feels like an excessively long two hours and twenty minutes. At best, it is a solid tale made lacklustre in the telling.",The Lost City of Z

67,dcarsonhagy,A Journey to Nowhere,8,25 July 2017,"""The Lost City of Z"" is an ambitious movie (based on fact) regarding Percival Fawcett, an English explorer who sets his sites on Bolivia. He learns of a ""lost city"" and decides if he should discover such a place, it could change history. He finds traces of such a city on his first outing, but is so ridiculed and doubted by his fellow Brits, he realizes he will receive no further help and must now look for the City on his own.The movie is well acted, directed, and the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking. It is rather slow, but there is so much covered in the film, you need time to process everything thrown at you. Personally, I always had a sense of dread during the movie. Mr. Fawcett explored a jungle that had never been explored before and encountered mostly cannibalistic tribes during his searches.The movie is rated PG-13 for violence and adult situations.",The Lost City of Z
68,Mike_Devine,Hunnam brings Fawcett's trials and travails to life in 'Z',7,8 October 2017,"Not all period films are created equal, and those that focus on expeditions to uncharted territories are scrutinized even more. Amazon Studios' modest effort 'The Lost City of Z' explored the life of Percy Fawcett, a British colonel who explored the jungles of Amazonia in the early 20th century.With James Gray at the helm ('We Own the Night,' 'The Immigrant') and Charlie Hunnam in his element as Col. Fawcett, 'Z' is a more of a high-quality biography that focuses on character development than it is an epic blockbuster that is obsessed with special effects and antics found in action films. Following Fawcett's inaugural voyage to South America, it's clear to see the spark of desire to unearth the mystery around the indigenous civilization that inhabited the lost civilization. From this point on, Fawcett's thirst for discovery seems to take over more and more of his life, which takes a toll on his family, including his young children and wife (Sienna Miller).This personal struggle is one that is constant throughout much of 'Z,' which adds more meaning to the film as opposed to just focusing on the travails in the piranha-infested waters and among the arrow-wielding natives of the Amazon. Of course, the sacrifices Fawcett must make are necessary, but seeing them play such a central part of the film is unique. Another one of the film's strengths is its focus on the politics of the Royal Geographical Society and British society as a whole, as the pressures forced upon Fawcett as a result of the disbelief among those who never set foot in the ""lost city,"" as well as their protests at the insinuation that the civilization could have been ""advanced.""Another element that works in 'Z's favor is its smart pacing. Instead of wasting time on the multiple months-long transatlantic voyages, we instead see how Fawcett's life and fortunes turn both at home in the UK and abroad. It's also worth noting that Robert Pattinson's portrayal of Fawcett's sidekick Henry Costin is actually a pretty good performance, suggesting there might be some more niche roles he can play in the future.'Z' may not have found a strong following at the box office, but the fact that Amazon Studios was able to deliver another quality picture suggests we're in store for even more. It also would not be out of the question for Hunnam to be a dark horse for acting noms come awards season.",The Lost City of Z
69,doug_park2001,"""Nothing will happen to us that is not our destiny""",7,24 April 2017,"Many people will approach this film expecting to see a riveting historical adventure. While there is a great deal of compelling exposé of Percy Fawcett and crew's exploration of the Amazon, encounters with Indians, wild beasts, and so forth, as well as some tense battle scenes of the WWI Battle of the Somme, those people are likely to be disappointed in the end. ""The Lost City of Z"" is more of a philosophical think-piece and character study of a tragic hero than anything else. The story of how Percy Fawcett must find the Lost City that he has no certainty actually exists, even when it means probable death and neglect of his own family, is thought-provoking, but no more so than many other films of this type. We don't really empathize that much with Fawcett's obsessions, mainly because the film doesn't make the unexplored Amazon seem terribly alluring, nor does it really show what makes him so confident the City is out there somewhere.Some plot-holes and ambiguities, but nothing just ruinous. LCZ is basically watchable, with some pronounced draggy spots. Yet, it lacks that necessary something it needs to make it truly satisfying. The whole mood of the film is somber in a way that's likely to lose much of the audience. There have also been some criticisms of its lack of historical accuracy. I'm not really sure of the real story, but like most ""docudramas,"" LCZ should certainly be taken with a dose of salt.All this being said, the acting by all is quite good, and Charlie Hunnam (Fawcett) is an actor we're likely to see more of in the future. Same for the cinematography and directions, particularly in how LCZ utilizes details of its setting in time: It really takes us back to the early 1900s.",The Lost City of Z
70,emuir-1,Very disappointing,3,20 August 2017,"As an avid viewer and collector of every film and book about exploration in South America and Africa, I could not wait to see this film. Living in rural America I had to wait for the download or DVD, but oh, was I ever disappointed! Rather than the multiple viewings of Augirre, Fitzcarraldo, the Mission, King Solomon's Mines, Rhodes, even Raiders of the Lost Ark and hokey old Republic movies, this film completely missed the mark. For one thing it was murky and dark. I checked the box to see if it was SD or Standard as the resolution was so poor. Where we should have had brilliantly clear images of the mountains and jungle, we got a few seconds, then back to the gloom. A lot of time seemed to be spent floating upriver on rafts. The book by David Grann, on which the film was based, was a journalist's account of the life and subsequent disappearance of Col. Percy Fawcett who made seven expeditions to Amazon region, not three. Mr. Grann did not have much to work with, so like a good journalist, he hyped up what he had and speculated on the rest. Fawcett was an army officer who after serving 20 undistinguished years in Ceylon and faced with a lack of advancement, took a surveying course and was sent to impartially survey the borders of Peru and Bolivia on behalf of Britain to avoid hostilities. He made several trips, and after a break for WWI, in which he did not serve on the front line as shown in the film, being too old, he became obsessed with the idea of a lost city, which along with the discovery, would help British prestige by placing another jewel in the crown. At the time, British explorers had been planting the flag in Africa and spreading the good word throughout the savage world. Fawcett may also have been driven by a desire to get there before the Americans, as Hiram Bingham's discovery of Machu Picchu had captivated the world's imagination. Captain Scott, whose ill fated expedition to the South Pole, where he was beaten by a Norwegian by 10 days and perished on the return journey, was regarded by an outraged Britain as a hero cheated of his rightful victory by that cad Amundssen's use of dogs! Make no mistake, the British firmly believed in the superiority of the British Empire, and that all future discoveries belonged to British gentleman by right, not Americans and foreigners! WWI was to shake that belief and any heroic exploits which could be seized on to beat the drum and restore the faith was seized upon. The film conveys little of this. Where I expected longer sequences showing the hardships and near starvation and deaths endured by the explorers, we got three brief expeditions which might just as well have been a boy scouts weekend camping trip. One expedition failed after 10 days starvation, of which a photograph still exists of the emaciated survivors. Where were the clouds of biting insects which made sleep impossible, dangerous snakes dropping from trees, the 62 foot long Anaconda which was killed, waterlogged boots rotting from the damp? The journey to reach the expedition sites took months, usually overland from Buenos Aries, but the film gave the impression it was two days by air. One minute they are in the jungle, a few seconds later the ocean liner is being welcomed by cheering crowds in Britian. Fawcett may not have been the heroic expert explorer that was portrayed by the press of the time, desperately searching for heroes and in the process glorifying some flawed men. In leaving his wife to raise their children alone he was really no different from Captain Scott and serving army officers posted to India and the far east and naval officers who left their families for years on end. He was a man of his time doing what was generally accepted. Had he not disappeared during a highly publicized expedition, he may very well have been forgotten. The one thing he was right about was the belief that there had previously been an advanced civilization in the Amazon. We now know from recent discovery and satellite images that there had indeed been an advanced culture which supported thousands of people, and that the remains have been swallowed by the jungle regrowth, and the descendants of a people and culture destroyed by the European discovery have fallen into a dark ages. Whether his belief in and attempts to discover a lost city were entirely scholarly, or motivated by fame and the possible discovery of gold, we don't know and probably never will.To be fair and to give the film another chance, I will watch it again to see if my boredom (I switched off three times and went to do something else, including the washing and ironing) was just that I was not in the mood. Sometimes my opinion has changed on a second viewing.",The Lost City of Z

72,austin0731,"Unconventional, yet an all encompassing recount of the intriguing search for the Lost Cities of the Amazons",8,15 June 2017,"After coming out of the gates strong, but then slipping in terms of reviews I went into The Lost City of Z intrigued but unsure of what I would come out with. I must say I felt that The Lost City of Z was extremely fascinating and interesting, it is a well adapted recount of the life of Colonel Percy Fawcett. I found this film to be bold and tackles multiple themes in its long runtime of over 2 hours, a factor that may have caused the film to drag a bit yet I still enjoyed it quite well. Firstly the cinematography was amazing, the crew has spent time shooting in the Amazons and there is a real payoff that can be seen in the final works, all the scenes filmed in the jungle was magnificent. The acting from the more minor characters such as Tom Holland as Jack Fawcett and Sienna Miller as Nina Fawcett were great whenever they are on. But, I must talk about the two leads; Charlie Hunnam as Percy Fawcett and Robert Pattinson as Henry Costin. I really, truly don't get it. I do not get the Charlie Hunnam hate, I've seen this in the reviews for this film and also saw this for his role in King Arthur. I personally enjoyed his performance very much, in Arthur I found his charismatic and comedic whereas in the lost city he delivered quite well also, he manages the role quite well despite poor aging makeup (I finer detail that is a rather minor point). I felt that his emotions towards his family came through in his portrayal and I truly did not see him as a dull act. Now, Robert Pattinson on the other hand was just amazing, and this was truly a surprise after being bored through the entirety of the Twilight saga. He plays this grizzled and experienced character of Costin impeccably and this came as such a surprise because the character looks nothing like Pattinson's usually perceived young and sexy image. A true sign that Pattinson can pull off much more complex roles. So about the narrative itself which has been pointed out as poorly written I once again disagree, I found the story of the search for a hidden city extremely intriguing. The film deals with the theme of a questing adventurer quenching the audience's thirst for action and adventure but also tackles more profound themes also. It deals with the theme of obsession through Fawcett's undying need to find such a hidden city, to the point where it leads to the struggle between whether or not such a city existed at all. The film deals with the theme of 'the journey', the idea that the search/journey is more important than the destination and gave much character development and emotional development as the characters travel through the Amazons. There are themes of family, a man's duty, gender roles, the classic 'hero's journey' all sprinkled in yet all were dealt with accordingly and appropriately. It did not become a case where a film tried to encompass everything and end up in a mess precisely because of the extended run time and the expertly devised roles each idea played, none had too much of a presence to overtake the central theme of the film and that's why for me The Lost City of Z truly worked and is quite a masterpiece. This is unconventional filmmaking, is is a bold move from director James Gray. I cannot say that it paid off for everyone but personally it worked for me and I enjoyed this fascinating adventure film.",The Lost City of Z
73,daniewhite-1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzz,3,17 December 2019,"Dreadful waste of talent (both in front of and behind the camera) and material and one of the most disappointing films that I have watched compared to my expectations.Perhaps the jungle photography and some of the period costumes come out of this effort with the most credit....but all other departments are lacking.One question that I had was how come this films version of Fawcett was a cartographer and surveyor and therefore deemed appropriate to send on exploratory expeditions into the un-mapped unknown?I really couldn't understand that. So I had to check that out afterwards and the answer explains a great deal about how this film was so badly botched.The factual Fawcett was an officer in the British Army artillery. Which meant that he was required and trained by the army in all the disciplines necessary to lay artillery barrages. Skills and techniques directly transferable to the explorer-surveyor and a direct explanation as to how he would be deemed suitable to participate in surveying expeditions and, from that stage on, a full blown explorer.Instead here in 'The Lost City of Z' there is no link made to a real, tactile, believable military environment for Fawcett. No convincing context for him to exist as we are meant to believe that he does.Clearly, I would posit, this redrawing of the man's military heritage was done so as to enable him to fight, with line infantry, on the front line trenches of the WWI western front. This is the most famous part of that conflict with the general audience and it affords a great chance to place our protagonist in extreme harms way back in his ""normal life"", his European homeland.This is low hanging fruit in terms of dramatic art and causes any semblance of believability to depart the picture in the long run when you consider that this film is attempting to portray the literal and meta journeys of the character Fawcett.Had the 'The Lost City of Z' retained a more accurate military background for its protagonist then a far more interesting journey for our hero would have been sustained. The skills that have latterly made him a journey-er have caused him to be added to the battlefield carnage of a European generation.It would also have generated a more interesting angle on covering the combat of this conflict: indeed what is little known by the wider public is the truly astonishing level of expansion of field and siege artillery forces on the western front; with prodigious quantities of resource and manpower dedicated to this military arm by 1918's war end. This would again lead us closer to a telling of the story of the man Fawcett, in his time and place in this film, with all the potential for more resonant and powerfully dramatic situations that a more realised protagonist affords thoughtful dramas.Instead unbelievable, non-contemporaneous ideas and motifs are utilised to illuminate character interactions and ""help"" us learn our characters for ourselves. I learnt that I didn't remotely believe that any of these characters had, or could, exist as portrayed here.As a last point to reinforce this, the real Fawcett disappeared on his final expedition accompanied by his son and his sons best friend. Now that sounds so real. So 1920's British. It could easily fit into any fictional tale originating from that very world. So 'muddle through'. So amateurish. So clubish. Essentially it sounds likely true to its time.This film decides to take the easy decision and omits the sons best friend. Because it would convolute and distract from a conventional and convenient father/son narrative.Altogether disappointing considering the level of critical acclaim earned. The film seems to pay homage to other sources, quite obvious film sources, rather than find an illuminatingband involving treatment of the actual source material: Percy Fawcett and his real happenings.The Lost City of Z is not totally without merit but I can only raise a 3/10 score myself; acting is competent but never convinces that these are people being portrayed by actors rather than actors playing characters that could be anyone; direction and editing lack thrust and nuances; music and sound design are unremarkable; creative decisions and writing were disagreeable to me but as I say, photography and costumes were quite easy to appreciate.",The Lost City of Z

It's about a man that believed in a city lost in the jungle (not forest like they call it many times in the movie) and was obsessed with finding it, and for the good reasons, to share and learn. Maybe if there were more man like him (assuming the portrait is accurate in terms of the reasons for which he wanted to find the city) in history, now the world would be different and the past not so bloody.
Besides the controversy, the movie is well acted and beautifully filmed.
I see many complains about the writing, I didn't think it was bad at all, it's maybe just not so commercial as people always expect from Hollywood, looks like it tries to be faithful in the order of the events as they happened and might have failed a bit on engaging certain public, but it was definitely not boring for me.
I very much appreciate the thematic and enjoyed this production.
By the way, I'm from Argentina and traveled all South America, if that counts for the fact that this movie doesn't offend to south american people.

80,PotassiumMan,"Exploration epic, stirring beyond belief",10,16 April 2017,"One of the few films I've seen in recent memory that lingers on in a haunting way after you've seen it. It tells the story of Percy Fawcett, the British military officer and explorer who made it his life's work to discover an ancient civilization hidden deep in the Amazon jungle. Charlie Hunnam gives the best performance of his career so far as Fawcett. Equally superlative is Sienna Miller, who plays his devoted wife who willingly accepts her husband's insistence on sacrifice in the name of the family and greater glory.Although this film has a lush, visually splendid look, there is nothing self-indulgent or superficial about it. It epitomizes how arduous Fawcett's objective was and how he never let go of what became his deepest longing. The film earns its running time by portraying the psychology of a man whose dream never leaves him.I am not sure the extent to which the film scrubs Fawcett of his own attitudes toward the tribal peoples that lived in this part of the world and I don't care. The film does a good enough job or portraying Fawcett in morally ambiguous shades but also refuses to judge him for the man that he was. The film is more about what went from being an impromptu assignment to an intensely personal cause for one man. It is one of the richest pieces of cinema in recent times. Recommended to the highest degree.",The Lost City of Z
81,yogeshevolution,A good mix up,7,27 January 2020,The movie is good describing the condition in early 90's where society was real obstruction to do something new. The story is real so it seems dull but is really interesting and of bravery. A good watch.,The Lost City of Z
82,rutzelb,A Well Told Story,9,13 July 2017,"This is based upon a True StoryBefore WWI, British Officer Major Percy Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam) is ordered to survey a border dispute between Brazil and Bolivia because rubber is the product both countries want. On his second trip to the Bolivia jungle he discovers pottery made by natives who he believes are a much older civilization than most Western countries. Of course, he is not believed and is somewhat ridiculed. After the War, he goes back to find what he has labeled as the City of Z (The British pronounce it ZED), but this time he goes back with his son Jack (Daniel Huttlestone).This is a well told story and considering the amount of material involved in here, this is some accomplishment. This is very well done. The acting all around is excellent. We see Fawcett's wife Nina (Sienna Miller) who is instrumental in discovering an article by a Conquistador who believed there was a civilization of Natives much older than believed by the West. And she wants to go on Fawcett's next trip and, of course, that can't happen (Shades of Womens' lib here). I have to tell you that Robert Pattinson is in this movie because no one will recognize him with his beard and he really isn't given many lines of dialogue: basically he is just there beard and all. He is Henry Costin, Fawcettl's right hand man and good friend. I have only 2-objections: We should have been privy to more landscape scenery of Bolivia and, perhaps, the more important one: lack of a good musical score. This movie made me recall the movie THE MISSION that had a wonderful and memorable musical score. Didn't happen in here and it should have. Bummer. The objections aside, this is a story told on a grand scale and we cannot wait to see how it all plays out. Kudos. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: Yes. Language: Only one GDI was heard.",The Lost City of Z
83,Freedom060286,Disappointing,3,1 November 2017,"Other than the fine acting of Charlie Hunnam and Tom Holland, this movie was rather disappointing.It was rather poorly-written and directed, and painfully dull to watch in parts. The historical inaccuracy was annoying. Fawcett was portrayed as a very liberal person with an agenda of proving that the natives of South America had an advanced city many centuries before European civilization. In reality, he was more of an explorer, adventurer, surveyor, soldier and mapmaker who wanted to learn more about a former agricultural culture in the Amazon basin. The movie has it that Fawcett, after disappearing in the jungle, lived out the rest of his life after being accepted as a respected member of a cannibal tribe, but most historians agree he and his son were either killed by hostile natives or succumbed to tropical diseases.",The Lost City of Z
84,diand_,Exploitation and exploration,5,22 February 2017,"Based on the true story of British explorer Percy Fawcett, who made several expeditions to the lost city of Z, believed to be the remains of El Dorado in the Brazilian jungle. The movie follows three of these expeditions and first picks up his life with a long introduction from his military career onwards. The movie becomes only interesting with the start of his first map making expedition on the border of Bolivia and Brazil in 1906. Based on documentary and field research (pottery finds), Fawcett became ever more convinced that a complex civilization had existed there. The movie then touches upon a second expedition initiated by the Royal Geographical Society that lead to controversy about his role in that expedition. The first World War comes in between before he makes his last expedition in 1925 with his son.The script is based on the fascinating book by David Grann, who visited the region in 2005 and came back with interesting findings about Fawcett's expedition. By now, Fawcett has turned into an icon of exploring ancient civilizations, making its way into popular culture, Indiana Jones and The Lost World come to mind.The movie and script is however too obvious for the story at hand. It is painting by numbers, going from phase A to B in Fawcett's life without any intelligent storytelling, ending up with a movie that I first thought was made for TV or online. Compare this to the classic Herzog movies Aguirre or Fitzcarraldo, and it is clear what went wrong here: Being about exploration, the movie itself shies away from exploring cinematic possibilities and just plays it safe. Wouldn't it for example not be far more interesting to just focus on that final expedition and make the multiple accounts into a movie? Why Pitt's Plan B saw anything in this is beyond me, as the company has by now a reputation of risk-taking (and often being awarded for that).But don't get me wrong: The movie is still watchable and the story itself is enough to keep your attention. And it is very nice to see Darius Khondji popping up here as DoP, you can still see his groundbreaking work in Se7en shining through.",The Lost City of Z
85,samyoung-82648,"Excruciating, but so much potential",5,30 June 2017,"For the first half of this movie, I grit my teeth. Between Charlie Hunnam's off-key acting (not dissimilar to his other recent King Arthur block buster) and Sienna Miller's terrible lines and lackluster delivery (oh, why must men make me wear fashionable clothing... really? Just like high heels today Sienna! It's men who make women do it. As an actress, Miller should have rejected this line as ridiculous rather than using it to promote propaganda).This movie was ham-fisted. The director tried to push far too much misguided politics hoping to appeal to the lowest common denominator. He tried to revise history (like a waltz 1/2 a step out of sync). The actors didn't have the chops to pull this off. Even the natives came across as simpletons far too frequently. To top off the clichés, Hunnam talks to a mystic woman, who talks about his desires and dreams. I left teeth marks in my knuckles, trying to dull the pain of the acting (and yes, I really do bite myself when seeing ham-fisted movies that have potential).Despite my criticisms, there were some scenes that felt genuine and exciting. Many of the river scenes felt realistic (and I later found they were shot in remote areas). Also, the scenes between Charlie Hunnam and Tom Holland (Percival and Jack) actually felt quite natural when they were exploring together (and ONLY when they were exploring).If anybody stole the movie, it was Robert Pattinson as Henry Costin. He was charming, funny and added the only authentic heart to this story. It was also a treat to See Ian McDiarmid (the the Emperor Palpatine fame from Star Wars) back on the screen.I respected Sienna Miller's attempts to add depth to Nina Fawcett (Percival's equal wife - a notion I highly applaud), but her insistence on over-emphasising that she was a woman (far too often) was heavy handed and clichéd, like most other movies for the last 10 years. Then Miller has the audacity to say her performance was different because it was a strong female character (when it was lacking because she played it like a modern feminist rather than a human being: I MUST go on this expedition despite having young children because I'm a woman and I can do ANYTHING a man can).If you're strapped for a movie to watch, consider watching this one. It's definitely over-rated (unless you like pompous speeches by someone with an English accent). If you like revised history, cheesy acting and less emotion to your stories, you may like this one. Hunnam and Miller let the film down. This film is not suitable for kids due to graphic imagery in a few sections.",The Lost City of Z
86,justinwfirestone,Sad. Terribly sad.,5,30 April 2017,"The title almost says it all. It is really The Lost City of ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZs, as in total snooooooooooze fest. Actually, it's a British affair, so it's The Lost City of Zed. But then it's not very funny to say it's really the Lost City of Zedddddddddddddddds. Or is it?Charlie Hunnam, he is not a good enough actor to pull this off. My brain, it is not capable of handling 141 minutes of a movie like this. At one point, I thought I had been trapped in an episode of The Twilight Zone, watching Percy Fawcett going to and leaving from the Amazon River, over and over again, in a never-ending loop. Or was that actually an episode of Black Mirror?It's an action-adventure-biography, according to some movie sites. There's not much action, and the adventure of getting lost in a jungle and not finding what you're after is, well, not much of an adventure. We've seen better river dangers in Apocalypse Now and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.It is, however, squarely a biographical film. It was nice to see an imaginary end for Percy and his son, Jack, played swellly by the new Spiderman guy. You see, the Fawcetts probably drank some ayahuasca with some natives and then got carried away into a bunch of candles. Oops. Spoiler alert!In all actuality, they probably got swallowed up by a big, black snake. Sad.

87,barbagvido,"Advertised as thrilling, but it's pretty much just a biopic...",7,10 October 2017,"The Lost City of Z is a movie about a British man at the beginning of a 20th century who goes to expedition in Bolivia, but finds more than he was looking for and that grows into an obsession. It stars Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Tom Holland. Judging by the trailers, it looked like a grounded and thrilling adventure movie, but it's really not that. It's pretty much just a biopic, actually.I knew that it's based on a true story, but I thought it was a bit more fictionalized version of it. Maybe it really is, I don't know. But if it is, then it could have been a lot better. As you see, I don't know some of the facts about the movie. That's because the movie didn't grip me enough to actually be interested in all that. It's well-shot, extremely well-acted (particularly by Hunnam and Holland) and it does have it's interesting moments, but with the bad pacing and aside from the main character and some of his family no one is really developed. So I couldn't really connect to the characters. For example, Robert Pattinson's character is a large part of the story, but do you know much about him? Not really.The movie does have this character arc for the lead and I liked that, but I still feel it was a bit overlong. Not all of it felt really necessary, but there were some really emotional moments with the characters that actually were developed and those at least felt kinda earned.While it can get interesting, it's sluggish pace and some flat characters make it less exciting than it should have been. But there are also some beautiful moments that make up for it.",The Lost City of Z

I was reluctant to look at this as Hunnam does not have a good track record, for me. But continued praise and 'best movies you've missed' lists made me reconsider
My opinion is raised somewhat after this. My opinion of Pattinson continues to rise.
The little 'fails' are due primarily to the need for drama, such as the over-amped bombastics of the RNG lecture. Yes, there were ridiculous arguments in the Society over intractable preconceptions, and it's very possible that those very words were spoken. But in my nit-picky fashion I feel I can sense when the director has decided to 'juice it up a little'.",The Lost City of Z
89,murtaza_mma,Percy Fawcett comes across as a thinking man's Indiana Jones,8,30 July 2017,"It's really heartening to see Hollywood still making such movies... it's heartbreaking to see American audiences snubbing it even as they continue to embrace the dumb superhero films. Had David Lean made Embrace of the Serpent then perhaps it would have looked like The Lost City of Z. Here is a film that reminded me of so many great movies. A discernible viewer would find shades of Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now, The New World, The Wages of Fear, and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Charlie Hunnam plays an English explorer Percy Fawcett who comes across as a thinking man's Indiana Jones. The movie also features deeply nuanced performances from one of my modern favorites, Robert Pattinson, and the intelligently beautiful Sienna Miller.Kudos to director James Gray for his vision and courage to realize a film like The Lost City of Z.

However despite its long run time it doesn't really dig in too much at any point which leaves it kind of hovering. Sienna Millers character as the modern thinking wife somehow manages to make some impact, as does a pretty good Robert Patterson as the fellow explorer. Hunnam does his best to pull off the exploring gent however there's very little of the film spent in the forests and the journeys come across as more easy on screen, which I'm sure they were not. Tom Holland as the son joins the fray also, however very uneven especially with the membership of their own Amazon trooping fellowship expanding and contracting its membership with the wind. Very much no Indiana Jones here, I can see what the film is trying to do however maybe the scope being such a long period of time left it without some focus and impact.",The Lost City of Z
92,SimonD1900,Few seem to enjoy this movie.,7,5 July 2019,"The movie is about Percy Fawcett, a real life English explorer from the early 1900s. He was a man driven by ambition and had a passion for mystery and the unknown. Charlie Hunnman does the best role in his career here in my opinion, with a great potrayal of what this man could have been like.This is not the classical adventure movie, in the themes of, for example Indiana Jones. And this is probably where some lose interest. It's slow passed and perhaps a bit boring during it's over 2h run time. Though it is a remarkable story to tell. I would not have known it, if not for this movie. Exactly how accurate this film is to reality, is hard to tell, but for me, it did let me fantasies about what it could have been like. It also tells the story of man's will to go against great hardship in the pursuit of glory and adventure and that the journey is selldome as pompous as one would like to imagine.Also, it speeks of a time when England was this greatly sofisticated nation in the world but still knew very little and suffered tremendous ignorance.
There are also some sidenotes of how the roles of men and women in society were different, as it still is today but more ditinctivley back then. And perhaps these roles have been neccicary to be what they are, for many reasons we won't embark on now. But Fawcett's wife is portrayed as a very strong woman, as she probably was in real life, she always has to miss here husband, but still supports him. In many ways, she is as strong as him, raising the children while he is gone for many years in different periods again and again.The movie covers a lot of time in the characters life's and does soo with many big jumps, blanks you kind of have to fill in yourself. But I personally liked that, it made the movie more emersive since I really have to imagine what is going on, on many levels, to fully understand the characters and also what a big escapade like this was like and how it was known and received at the time by the public, but mostly the characters inner life's.Apparently Fawcett was ridiculed a lot through his career, but that never stopped him, and today, almost 100 years after his disappearence and death, we know that he was right all along.
In my opinion this movie tells a great story of a great man, also a great story of history and a great story of humanity as a whole. It was artistically and beautifully made. Though, perhaps a bit slow and boring at times.",The Lost City of Z

94,tstudstrup,The lost city of ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,1,2 March 2018,"One of the most boring movies I have ever seen. Charlie Hunnam is a terrible actor. At least this time, we don't have to suffer through him trying to fail at an american accent. Robert Pattinson is obvilusly trying to shed his Twilight image. Unfortunetely for him he is not nearly as good an actor as Daniel Radcliffe. And he is giving nothing to work with in this crap. He only accomplishes being almost unrecognizable with a huge beard and glasses. I dont know what kind of man the real Fawcett was, but he's not very likeable. He choses, time and time again, to leave his wife and kids, to look for a city in the Amazones, that will prove that a civilization was there, long before our own. 
 
He already has a small boy, before he goes on his first expedition to map the Amazones in order to clear his fathers name. I know these were different times, but why he cares what some old snobbish a-holes thinks of his father and why that is more important to him than his own family, is beyond me. He then porks his wife and leaves. He comes back, porks his wife again and goes on one more expedition. After he comes back from his second expedition, he now has three kids. Then WW1 breaks out. He considers it his duty to serve and once again put his own honour and country before his family. His eldest son is understandably pissed at him for deserting his family again and again. Fawcet survives the war but temporarily loses his eyesight. Finally he decides to stay home and take care of his family. But all of a sudden his eldest, now adult son, for no reason at all wants to help him find Moby Dick, ehr I mean the lost city. They leave, as heroes of all England. They meet some tribe and live with them in the rainforrest. They are carried down to a river in a scene that made no sense. They're not injured and seem fine. And later were told they dissappeared. Nobody ever took Fawcett seriously. And he died as a failure. Both as an explorer and as a husband.  The EndWhy we should care about some military man and explorer, that wasted his life, looking for his white whale, who died 93 years ago, is a boring mystery.

96,makleen2,"Somehow manages to make an incredible, real-life story boring",5,3 October 2017,"Written and directed by James Gray, The Lost City of Z (2016) traces the life of British soldier and explorer Percy Fawcett. Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam) is compelled to scour the Amazon for evidence of a lost civilization. Along the way, he'll repeatedly abandon his wife Nina (Sienna Miller) and his children and overcome resistance from skeptical colleagues, all to ultimately come up empty handed. It is based on a book of the same name by David Grann.I've been looking forward to seeing this film since its release, because it's one of those real life stories more incredible than fiction. Percy Fawcett's adventures inspired both Indiana Jones and Arthur Conan Doyle's novel The Lost World (1912). Unfortunately, The Lost City of Z was less an adventure film and more a plodding, meandering biopic that never quite finds its footing.As the film opens, we see Percy Fawcett at the cusp of the British upper class. He is a major in the army, but has no medals; he goes on a hunt and kills the stag, but is not invited to dine on it. We see he's skilled, daring, and willing to take risks. However, this isn't quite an introduction.The filmmakers assume their audience already knows who Percy Fawcett is, but he is a relatively obscure historical figure, especially to American audiences. It's crucial to quickly establish the identity of the main character and why he is important. Otherwise, you lose the audience's attention.Thirteen minutes into the film, a plot finally appears. We learn Fawcett's father was a gambling drunkard, and he is told that if he completes his mission to map the Bolivian border it will redeem his family name.Fawcett discovers pottery deep in the Amazon, but on his return to England, Royal Geographical Society members are skeptical that South American natives are capable of producing such artifacts. He convinces a few members to accompany him on another expedition, which turns up nothing. Fawcett goes off to fight in World War One where he's wounded in a gas attack and later reconciles with his eldest son, Jack (Tom Holland).Jack convinces him to embark on one final expedition. We see them wander around the jungle for a while until they're captured by an Amazon tribe and drugged, leading to a pointless flashback / hallucination before the screen fades to black. Back home, many years later, Nina presents the president of the Royal Geographical Society a compass Percy said he would send home if he ever found the lost city.Historically, no one knows what happened to Percy and Jack Fawcett, who disappeared on May 29, 1925, but it's likely they were killed by hostile natives or succumbed to disease. Over the past several years, anthropologists have discovered concrete evidence of a lost civilization in the Amazon, near where Fawcett went missing.This film is more or less accurate, although it softens some of his unusual beliefs, including that the lost city of Z was an outpost for ancient extraterrestrial gods and a remnant of Atlantis. In one interesting scene, during the First World War, he's shown consulting with ""Madame Kumel"" (Elena Solovey), a character based on psychic and occultist Madame Blavatsky. Although Fawcett was a devotee of Blavatsky's, she died in 1891.The Lost City of Z somehow manages to make an incredible, real-life story boring. It suffers from lack of direction and plods along unmercifully for 141 minutes. The film should have started right in the middle of the action, on Fawcett's last expedition. His personal history and previous expeditions could be retold through brief flashbacks. Instead, it takes so long to get to the point, then leaves audiences with a cheap teaser to make up for lack of a satisfactory conclusion. As a result, it bombed at the box office, grossing $8.57 million in U.S. sales off a $30 million budget. What a disappointment.",The Lost City of Z

98,trevor-82944,A Great Manly Trek That Could Use a Compass,5,21 April 2017,"The Lost City of Z; the one place men way back when thought of only as an obscure concept. Uncharted territory will always exist in our world, so who holds the right to claim it? It turns out a whole extra layer of humanity exists in our home called Earth, and it was the achievements of soldier Percy Fawcett who helped us dig deeper. Based on the book by David Grann as well as factual truth, The Lost City of Z aligns remarkable close with real life to tell us about how our past can help us press onward. ​ Director James Gray (The Immigrant) retells history through the perspectives of whoever influenced the great man's journeys, including the British council, his three children, and his committed wife. The missus criticizes him for leaving home to explore new worlds, sharing no part of it with them. She wants him to think women have it harder than men, considering the pains of childbirth and house care. Yet she barely knows anything about the true unkind nature of South America's rainforest, a world ruled by snakes, bats, and starvation.Yes, every character expresses enough inner conflict to keep any man invested along with his wife and son. Although Gray's feature may just as well best suit male audiences, as the whole family side to the feature gets underused rather poorly; Mr. Fawcett's three kids hardly have anything to say, let alone any attention. While the oldest, played by Tom Holland (Captain America: Civil War, Lo impossible), delivers a strong treatment, his screen presence offers no justice. He does not give the worst performance ever, but you could still buy into him, unlike the insufferable child who plays the younger pre-teen version of himself.Away from all familiarity, Mr. Fawcett takes on the dangers of the outside world in Brazil's rainforest. His team goes on the search for a hidden civilization void of previous White folk visitation. They eventually find ancient pottery, only miles away from a native tribe, who quickly become allies. These non-English speakers contribute well to the story, except they receive too little dialogue to leave a true impression on anyone, including the protagonist.In fact, most of the time, these Red-skins are the arrow launching, bloodthirsty savages the British stereotype them as. Their weapon of choice cause unimaginable chaos for these sightseers, including entanglement underwater behind a cloud of blood. It sets all sort of energy upon the screen, guaranteeing an aggressive transportation into the environment, clearly the film's best moments.Then once the action screeches to a halt, we have the camera-work by cinematographer Darius Khondji (Evita, Se7en) to watch. In fully sincerity, he has created probably the worst efforts of his career—no contrast exists in the already dark and grainy image. He just makes everything green and sunny, even if it means blowing out details in the facial features. Thankfully however, the tremendous eyesore turns slightly merciful three-quarters of the way through the movie. Here, the genre briefly turns into a relatively unimpactful war drama, which still manages to deliver Saving Private Ryan-esque thrills to those testosterone senses.Numerous other traits uplift this average joe of a biopic, such as the believable period costumes and the breathtaking greenery, while others pull it back, such as a forgetful musical score and Robert Pattinson's acting (progress is being made though). Maybe things could have worked better if Bleecker Street aimed for a hard-R rating, as the Brazilians themselves features all sorts of related red flags: naked overweight women, cannibalism, to name a few. At least nothing appears excessive enough to make any teenagers squirm with immaturity.So now the question remains: ""should I bother sitting through a biopic that probably won't make it past 20 million in the box office?"" The Lost City of Z may not be the riskiest motion picture ever made, but it offers precisely what worldwide audiences need while considering the ancestry of ourselves, and how the inadequateness of our self-knowledge points us towards a single reality: we all come from the same soil.",The Lost City of Z

There isn't a single, solitary scene that doesn't have its place. Every single aspect about this movie is executed with perfection. The story of this explorer who becomes obsessed with finding proof of a lost civilization that predates what his peers and elders believe to be true is pulled off with true tenacity in its writing, direction, cinematography, editing, tone, pacing, and performances. Charlie Hunnam takes a hold of the entire screen and commands every line he projects. In the years to come I do hope that this film is remembered fondly as being one of the greats of all time because I sincerely believe that this film is one of the greats. This is an epic in the same vein as something that would have been made back in the New Hollywod Era of the 1970s and early 1980s such as Godfather Part 1 and Part 2, Papillon, Heaven's Gate, and even The Mission. If this film isn't studied in film schools at some point down the line just like how Citizen Kane is, then there is something wrong with this world. Lost City of Z explores a man's obsession to find something greater than himself, what a man's legacy means and if the acts of a person should be what he's remembered in history for or who he really was as a man. Is a man's legacy what makes the man or is the man what makes the legacy? I loved this film and I hope that it finds way more love in the future.",The Lost City of Z

106,pronker,"Fascinating Fawcett, Fine Film.",9,8 February 2018,"Since about 1970, I've been interested in Fawcett and so this movie fits into the niche of 'gotta see it.' I liked the movie's daring to be made at all, frankly, so congratulations to Pitt; the subject of exploration with hype suited to early 20th century mindsets rang true. The depiction of the departure final trip's acclaiming crowds made me happy for Fawcett and to see him charmed by the fame and financial support touched me. He certainly had it difficult for years and years.Now I've read Grann's book and yes, admired its treatment of a difficult personality to our 21st century ways of thinking. For him to explore years at a time, and on more numerous expeditions than the film covers, by leaving his growing family behind is hard to take. It's like workers who leave their countries to work in other countries for the money and leave their families behind; it's acceptable but certainly not desirable to have to go 'where the work is.'As a movie, the cinematography of jungle and countryside captivated me and the British costumes looked right. The attitudes of Fawcett and his wife seemed to me to be okay for the period, as Fawcett lived in a strict military world and Mrs. Fawcett played along to a certain extent. Her yearning to accompany her husband into the wild was wrong-headed basically, but her 'independence' dictated that she at least try to come along, I guess, in terms of emotional logic. A movie without Miller's Nina Fawcett would have been a poorer movie. I liked her performance even while disagreeing with the urge to leave her three children behind. Other reviews stated how the raft miraculously floated upstream and ha, I didn't even notice that bit! The character study that was this movie carried me along and I didn't care about that unrealistic part. All in all, I recommend this movie as a paean to courage and love of the unknown; the cost of that love sure looks to have been paid by Fawcett and his son.",The Lost City of Z

It leads the audience to believe that Fawcett actually found Z. For the sake of cinema, you can have some license by excluding certain factors. These include Jack's friend Raleigh Rimell, who's health was a drag on the final expedition trip. You can even downplay Fawcett's pre-expedition's career. But you cant try to blur the lines between history and reality. Especially at the end. It's unforgivable. That being said, the acting was excellent on all fronts, with the exception of maybe Sienna Miller as Nina Fawcett at the end. Her portrayal of a now delusional wife, was a little off kilter.The cinematography was great.But what she hands to the man at the end never happened, period. Is it worth the watch?

110,scottingram,The Lost City Of Z Film Review,8,25 March 2017,"The new film The Lost City Of Z based on the true story of the British explorer Percy Fawcett starring Charlie Hunnam, Sienna Miller, Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson.In The Lost City Of Z which is based on author David Grann's nonfiction bestseller, THE LOST CITY OF Z tells the incredible true story of British explorer Col. Percival ""Percy"" Fawcett (English actor Charlie Hunnam - US TV Series Sons Of Anarchy, Pacific Rim), who journeys into the Amazon in South America at the dawn of the 20th century during the 1900's to the 1920's and discovers evidence of a previously unknown, advanced civilization that may have once inhabited the region. Despite being ridiculed by the scientific establishment who regard indigenous populations as ""savages"", the determined Fawcett – supported by his devoted wife Nina Fawcett (American actress Sienna Miller - American Sniper, Foxcather), son Jack Fawcett (English actor Tom Holland - Captain America: Civil War, In The Heart Of The Sea) and aide de camp Henry Costin (English actor Robert Pattinson - Twlight films, Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire) – returns time and again to his beloved jungle in an attempt to prove his case, culminating in his mysterious disappearance in 1925 which is 92 years ago now.Amongst the other actors / actresses in The Lost City Of Z include English actor Harry Melling (Harry Potter films) as William Barclay, Italian actor Franco Nero (Die Hard 2: Die Harder, Django Unchained) as Baron de Gondoriz, Scottish actor Ian McDiarmid (Star Wars films, Sleepy Hollow the 1999 film) as Sir George Goldie, Scottish actor Angus Macfadyen (Braveheart, We Bought A Zoo) as James Murray, English actor Daniel Huttlestone (Les Misérables 2012, Into The Woods) as Brian Fawcett Nina and Percy's other son, German actor Aleksandar Jovanovic (Collide, UK TV Series Close To The Enemy) as Urquhart, Edward Ashley (In The Heart Of The Sea, UK TV Series Last Tango In Halifax) as Arthur Manley, English actor Bobby Smalldridge (What We Did On Our Holiday, UK TV Series White Gold) as Young Jack Fawcett, Nicholas Agnew (Kingsman: The Secret Service, The Man Who Knew Infinity) as John Coundley, Johann Myers (The Bank Job, The Medallion) as Willis, Michael Jenn (Unleashed, Quills) as Brigd- General Sidney Thornton, John Sackville (The Wedding Date, The Hoarder) as Simon Beauclerk, Tom Mulheron (The Time Of Our Lives) as Young Jack Fawcett, English actor Adam Bellamy as Cecil Gosling and Matthew Sunderland (Out Of The Blue, The Devil's Rock) as Dan.Filming locations in The Lost City Of Z include places like Colombia and Bolivia in South America, Belfast the capital of Northern Ireland and County Down, Northern Ireland.Overall The Lost City Of Z is a good film filled with explorers, exploration, shooting, bows and arrows, weapons, some violence, soldiers, explosions, things getting blown up, rivers, boats, Indian tribes in groups, forests, some hard hitting scenes, the way of life between the 1900's to the 1920's, horses, family, people in uniform, music, dancing, political figures who meet up on a regular basis, green grass fields, impressive looking mountains, river rapids, Spanish language, good performances from Charlie Hunnam and Robert Pattinson as their respective characters and many other things throughout the film.So I will give The Lost City Of Z an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and I will say The Lost City Of Z is worth seeing if you like films based on true stories like Gorillas In The Mist or any other films along the same lines as this. So if you get the chance to see The Lost City Of Z in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later.",The Lost City of Z

It's mostly a slow drama that takes place in modern civilization outside of the jungle, which is pretty disappointing for a movie supposedly about an explorer who's going to EXPLORE the jungle.

114,mkivtt,Yawn.,4,8 December 2017,"Another disappointment. This mishmash of a movie doesn't seem to know what it wants. It pretends to be an adventure movie, but more than half of it is spent in England's high society. It pretends to be a thriller, but not for a moment was it riveting or scary. It also wants to be a drama, but not for a second did I care even one iota for one of the characters.The plot is clearly made-up and juiced up for Hollywood. I.e. the hero and his two buddies who have been on his two prior expeditions, are conveniently and magically reunited in the same World War 1 trench (sure, sure, it say they were both transferred to him, but in reality you know the army brass wouldn't give a hoot).The jungle scenes are brief and short and you never really get the idea that they're really out there roughing it. Sure, the movie tries, but it fails. The piranhas and Indian arrows and whatever else seem more of an afterthought that the director threw in there to mark the boxes on his ""checklist of excitement"" and it just doesn't work.The hero sure is a moron too, by the way. His ""expeditions"" consist of a handful of men, a rickety raft, and they are always short on supplies. He's just asking to fail. Couple this with his ridiculously naive worldview where Indians who wear loincloths and live in mud huts somehow aren't savages, but his ""equal,"" and he deserves what's coming to him. One of his quotes is, ""oh look, these people managed to build a field of maize, with mathematical precision"" and he practically gushes about how smart and civilized and wonderful they are.... OK, buddy...The movie ends without really knowing what happened to the hero and his kid, but given that they were stupid enough to go into the jungle all by themselves without supplies or support, I'm sure he got what was coming to him.Not gripping, not exciting, just yawn and stupid.",The Lost City of Z

116,targe1314,"A bunch of guys, mumbling in the dark",5,8 August 2017,"I went in with high hopes, I like Indiana Jones, was this guy the spiritual inspiration for him? I like ancient cities in the jungle. I knew they just found one in the forests of Peru with satellite software. This movie could have been so much more.Instead we are 'treated' to endless 'in-the-dark room filming', with stoffy English gentlemen 'harrumphing' at each other endlessly.When our hero finally DOES find the ancient city, by magically riding a river BACKWARDS up it on a raft to it's source, he finds, a black panther guarding a bunch of broken pottery under the leaves....Big Tip for the director here... Ancient Cities bury EVERYTHING in feet of dirt when they go vanished, EXCEPT their gigantic cyclopean RUINS.... you know, the gigantic step pyramids?? People think they are triangle shaped mountains? This is all that remains. You certainly don't find them by tripping over broken pottery that is scattered around on the jungle floor, which would make it at most, what, 100 years old?After weeks and weeks of searching for this, (or is it years and years... we really don't know, his wife was preggers when he left, and has a 1 year old when he returns, yet somehow mysteriously his son has aged at least 5 years...), he immediately does a 'well, that was neat. Let's get back.' and they jump back on the raft and leave, with ZERO exploration, investigation, anything.Then we have a brief interlude in WWI, where our hero charges a German machine gun position with a pistol, get's gassed, and loses his vision.One annoying thing is this movie was the attempt to bring modern day morality and rights into early 20th century England. Women demanding equal treatment and defying their husband, and children yelling at their father. It was all very jarring and 'out of period'. If your going to do a historic piece, make it historic, complete with the sexism, the heavy handed discipline, etc etc.Finally the sound quality in this movie is atrocious. We had to dial it up to 75 to make out what they were saying in many scenes, and then you realize it's because they are mumbling! Mumble mumbles, all the way through, and WAY too many dark scenes. Dark English mansions. Dark ship holds. Dark jungle floors. You need a flashlight to watch this.",The Lost City of Z
117,laurelhardy-12268,They really don't make movies like this anymore.,8,4 March 2021,"First, this saga has, (what many complain about), slow scenes. But as an adventure/biography, it's a must. One must merely be in the mood for it. The dialogue spells out so much, it's a must.
Without being a spoiler, it's interesting to learn so much about the manifest destiny to worlds unknown by both England & America back around the onset of the 20th century, and thereafter.
Otherwise, this movie possesses much action in Amazonia. And it depicts a truly fascinating interpretation of certain tribes of the area at that time.
My wife got hooked on it and so we finished it on night 2 (as it is lengthy.). I became more and more engrossed with each scene, both at home (their England), and abroad. I'm very glad I watched it.All that said; this is an very high quality production. that Hollywood forgot how to do decades ago. And with great character consistency throughout. Filming and cinematography are time stamped beautifully as well.Bob",The Lost City of Z
118,iamjacksmoviechannel,Exploring the Amazon with Percy Fawcett,7,25 April 2017,"The Lost City of Z is a mostly historically accurate docu-drama about the search for a lost tribe, one that may even predate Britain's modern man in the early 1900's. I say mostly because the film makes it seem like something was found, when in actuality the man at the center of this could have fallen into a hole and died for all we know. That man is Percy Fawcett, who was a military man trying to regain his family's good name after his drunken father kinda sent it down the crapper. He wound up working for the geographic society in London and it's on a mapping mission for them that he found evidence of a whole society that may have or may still be living in the Amazon.And really the whole movie is told through his viewpoint so you really gotta like Percy to want to get through this 2 hour and 20 minute movie because it is definitely a slow burn all the way to the end. I mean sometimes like watching Paint-dry slow. But Charlie Hunnam, this is the dude's best performance as a movie star. His fans know him most as Jax Teller on Sons of Anarchy, but with Pacific Rim and Crimson Peakumm, not great. Here you see the rousing excitement Fawcett has at studying the unknown, but not so much you miss his remorse at having to leave his family for years at a time. Fawcett is also a man fighting a battle on two fronts. He's looking for the tribe but he's also trying to convince those at home it actually exists, most of which portrayed as overwhelmingly British to the point they arrogantly shout everything. There's not a lot of comedy here but most of this made me laugh, including scenes with actor Angus MacFayden. And this again proves Tom Holland is going to have a career long after Spider-Man ends. He plays Fawcett's older son and is by far Hunnam's best acting partner in this. Sienna Miller is good here but doesn't get much to do besides be the supportive wife, while Robert Pattinson..he's trying to make amends, not Kristen Stewart just yet.This movie was directed by James Gray and some of the shots he puts together here really are incredibly suspenseful, like arrows shooting out from the jungle or an epic looking World War 1 creation. Most of the time we're in the jungle with these guys, you feel the heat, you get a sense there's danger behind those jungle trees.So overall this is really a slowly paced movie but it's fantastically acted and you always want to see where this all goes. Not something I would run out for but definitely worth a recommendation and a watch, so I go 7 out of 10 guys.",The Lost City of Z
119,Nolamoviedude,Another dud for Charlie H on the big screen,4,1 January 2019,This is the story of a British colonel( I may have the rank wrong) who goes off on multiple explorations of the Amazon to find the Lost City of Zed. He pretty much leaves his wife to raise their kid while he goes away for years. He finally comes back to a child who resents him then goes off to WWI and gets injured. Later his son and him go back to the Amazon for 1 more try but never return.Apparently this is based on a true story and is a great premise. Unfortunately the film falls flat and is boring at times.

120,horizonbts-206-628336,Great Adaptation from Bestseller to Big Screen,10,29 April 2017,"It has been a while since I read a book, then followed it up watching the movie on the big screen. I loved the book and enjoyed the true life story of Colonel Percy Fawcett. What these explorers experienced in the perils of mapping the Amazon were horrific. The book was very graphic with the true life descriptions of their encounters especially in the insect form. The movie as with most going to the big screen from book can't and wasn't able to capture all the details in the book. Still I found the adaptation to the big screen very enjoyable and heard people talking as they exited the movie wondering as to why this movie wasn't getting more press! I couldn't agree more as I found the movie captivating and was entranced the whole way through, not only because I read the book, but the actors and the true story was engaging (I would also recommend that you seek out the bestselling book). The movie covered more than I imagined it would on how Percy's family and wife were tormented with his long departures into the Amazon and the years that they spent without him being home. So glad I finally got to see the movie, as I was highly agitated that it took so long to get to a local screen-for the last two weeks it was over 100 miles away in a theater. This movie is worth seeing and I recommend that you seek it out, shame on all the theaters for not showing a movie of this high quality-very Oscar worthy! My only negative was that I wish they would have spent more time shooting the movie in the jungle versus the time he spent at home and on the battlefield in WW1. Also they could have done this movie similar to ""Titanic"" as the author of the book re-traced Colonel Percy Fawcett's last trip in the Amazon and also got information from the British Geographic Society in the form of documents and journals.",The Lost City of Z

What I DIDN'T like and found extremely distracting and just plain wrong was the time line of the movie. I found my self thinking about the kids way too much and how old they were and how old I thought they should be considering the previous dialog or scenes. Although the director did give us time stamps throughout the film, I couldn't reconcile them with the children's ages and the age progression of Percy Fawcett. Also, I was personally let down by the fact that we never do see the lost city. It is post scripted that now in modern day there has been evidence found showing indications of a lost city in both the location and in detail of what Fawcett was searching for. But what about the compass?? DID he and his son make it to the city of zed and then held captive so no other White Man would ever know, OR did they chose to stay until their end of days??

125,peter-stead-740-486963,Massive let down,3,28 March 2017,"It's a really good example of how a terrible script can completely destroy a movie. There are too many things which make no sense to list, but the key issues are:For a film that seems so keen to virtue-signal about white ignorance and racism, it does nothing to explain to us Fawcett's theories about the people of Z. Who were they? How did their civilisation operate? Why did they disappear? Surely these explorers would have built up far more of a picture from the surrounding tribes, artefacts, and previous finds. There is a tiny smattering of these things, but in 2h21ms nowhere near enough to build up a mythology. Therefore it's difficult to see why this obsesses Fawcett. You literally get more detail from the quests in the Indiana Jones movies.Instead it focuses relentlessly on the most tedious and dangerous aspects of the trips, their suffering, or switches back to London with almost every old man of course a stiff- upper-lip racist and sexist cliché. Imagine a more insidious General Melchett from Blackadder Goes Forth and you won't be far off.There is an extremely cringey attempt to insert a modern feminist perspective. At one stage, Nina wants to go on the expedition. Her reasoning? She found an important document relating to it. This apparently makes her equal to Fawcett's many years of soldiering and survival skills. It's clumsy and anachronistic. The trip could very well kill them both and so would leave their children orphaned. Surely a more logical argument would be whether he has to go at all. He is, after all, a father, and has responsibilities at home.The First World War section adds absolutely nothing and captures none of the horror of the battlefield. It's all just tally-ho chaps, almost Hallmark channel-like. Just awful.Sienna Miller, Robert Pattinson and especially Charlie Hunnam wring what they can from such a sparsely-written script and should be commended for that, which is why this isn't a 1.Don't be fooled by the title - it's not about a lost city or even a lost man.

126,bonsai-superstar,Well Done - Ignore Ignorant Reviewers,7,3 August 2017,"Ignore the rantings of the fool on the front page who completely missed the point. Sorry, buddy, but the movie is not about ""white ignorance"" and ""a modern feminist perspective"". In fact, it was excessively kind to your apparent heroes, the colonialist British. Crack open a history book and be forced to admit the truth (or, more likely, continue to wallow in ignorance). The true stories in this movie were about a man (Fawcett) trying to make his family name mentionable in polite society again (by pursuing glory at all costs) and the struggle of a woman forced to raise their children alone in the face of this. It's told subtly, yes, so any viewers expecting robot cars smashing things may be let down or, as in the case of that reviewer, confused. Any concessions made by the filmmakers to modernize the film were clearly done to make it understandable to a person such as peter-stead-740-486963. Again, to dumb it down for him, the movie WASN'T ABOUT ""the people of Z"" or ""how they operate"" (?). Looks like somebody didn't stick around for the postscript of this movie. Dear Pete: the movie is based on a true story. ""The people of Z"" were never discovered, so ""how they operate"" can sadly never be explained to you. How does IMDb choose which reviews are featured on the front page when such an ignorant review is prominently featured?Was it a great movie? No. Was it better than average? Yes. Was it a ""massive let down"" (chuckle)? To Petey, perhaps. To a critical thinker, it was a good movie.

For that reason, they could've used real life events on film to incorporate the tension of going through a jungle would be like (especially the amount of gear you need).
It really lacks in any emotional punch - nowt. It would have the actors at breaking points with filming in such conditions, then why not use this to the viewer's advantage? You need that sort of exploitation to tell this particular story.It was far too comfortable.
 
How did they ever keep on travelling back? To and fro throughout the film, and nothing of these particular journeys except of some parts of getting ""there"" (many theres in this film).Too big of a life for such a small film. Fixate on one aspect of life I would suggest - just pick one of these events and pull out the emotional and physical effort needed to draw on.

131,aranormer,Dull,3,4 February 2020,"I wasn't familiar with the hero of this movie beforehand, the great expeditions weren't really a thing taught in our schools. What little I know on the subject I picked up from random documentaries, old Tarzan movies and not as old Indiana Jones movies.Basic material of this movie was interesting, an age old story of adventure and discoveries. Both of them weren't to be found. Instead we were treated with a glimpse of the dreary side of a life of an adventurer and his family.Now, don't get me wrong, this movie still could have been watchable, I do not believe a second that Indiana Jones was an accurate depiction of a real life explorer.What constantly threw me off and kept me from immersing myself in to story was that there really was no story to speak of, and script writer, as well as the director seemed to have lost any sense of time. From what I have understood from documentaries and movies, expeditions weren't taken lightly. First they were several months, even years at planning and funding stage. Actual expeditions took at minimum several months, even years to complete. Yet kids at home got born during expedition. Same kids kept growing only when plot required it. Same kids completely forgot their dad only after what seemed to amount a few pitiful months, year at most.In addition to poor concept of time there was no sense of ecxitement. At no point I felt the burning need to see the lost city which was supposed to be the ultimate goal of the movie. Basically I sat on a chair, waiting and hoping for the city to show up or the hero to give up and die as a bitter old man.I can not recommend this movie to anybody.",The Lost City of Z

I didn't know anything about the true story and had not read the book it is based on, so I don't have any complaints about accuracy and I didn't compare it to the book. So from the point of view of a simple movie watcher, it was a great movie.The cast, locations, costumes, sets etc. were all great. The story was very enjoyable and it seemed quite authentic to its time period.
With a running time of 2hr 20mins it could have ran the risk of being long-winded and boring, but it kept my interest the entire time. I didn't think it felt like a long movie.
I'd only seen Charlie Hunnam and Robert Pattinson in a couple of movies before this, but I think they played quite different roles to usual and were both very good, as was the entire cast.

This movie however was long , drawn out and did not contain anything of interest even though it kept you hoping throughout that something exciting would occur. I think I have seen more action and adventure in a comic book. Acting was good, but nothing in this film will surprise you or get your adrenaline going.. 2 hours 20 minutes wasted,, I gave it one star for the acting,, otherwise it was a terribly disappointing film.",The Lost City of Z
135,mchinni-42999,The unknown,8,12 October 2019,"The most profound theme that this film explores is battling the unknown. We do not know for certain what is going to happen to us, the next moment or the next year, yet we must go on. For what? That we cannot answer. We console this uncertainty by thinking we do this for our loved ones.Another thing that really kept me interested in the film is the character of the protagonist, excellently portrayed by Mr.Hunnam, I must say. The protagonist seeks to find the lost city of with a fervent zeal. Why? Because he wants to call out the superiority his fellow English carry themselves with, by proving that the people that they've labelled as 'slaves' and 'uncivilized' are in fact far more advanced in civilization than they could ever imagine. He wants to once and for all, question the bigotry of the Church, of the English, by finding the lost city of Z, proving this to all the world. His ideals kept my resentment towards thr British stop me from watching this film. Whatever may have happened to him, he was a good man and a good man, and this I will always respect him for.I want to put in by saying that, if you wanted to prove that the colonized are in fact much more civilized than the colonizers,i.e, your fellow Englishmen, you should have come to India instead of South America.",The Lost City of Z
136,martin-807-452270,Someone managed to make the exploration of the Amazon incredibly dull.,2,29 March 2017,"*****Spoiler Alert**** I was really looking forward to this film, as how can the exploration of the Amazon be anything other than amazing? Well I was wrong, this was utterly boring, excruciatingly dull and just plain awful. I can only give it a 1 out of 5 rating. After the first 30 minutes I was looking at my watch and wondering if I should bother, as I had more important things to do, like clean the oven. How can anyone make the exploration of the Amazon so tedious? This could have been like real life Indiana Jones! There was absolutely no sense of danger at any point, just flat as a very thin pancake. The film should really be re-named The Lost City of Zzzzzzz.It was a truly odd film, this bloke gets asked to go Bolivia for the Royal Society to do some maps and stuff, doesn't want to go, But they offer him a shiny medal so he goes (leaving his wife and new born son), has a rubbish time, comes back to London, goes back to the Amazon (leaving wife, and second son), comes back to London, Goes to France for WW1, comes back to London and then goes to Amazonia again... For Heaven's sake man - just choose one! I shouted through gritted teeth.It's terribly directed and the cinematography is really bad (and I say this as a trained cinematographer). It's so dark that I actually wondered if the bulb in the projector was bust, but then it would cut to a scene outside in a garden and it would (almost) be correctly exposed. Some interiors were so badly lit I actually couldn't see who was speaking, and a huge number of shots were so out of focus I again wondered if we were watching a dud print. There was a really important (cough) scene with two blokes on a train having a chat about something. Now one bloke has a beard and one has a moustache, so that helps tell them apart in the dark, but for some reason we are looking at them over their shoulders and not 'at' them, and Mr Moustache-bloke turns away from camera (probably trying this 'acting' thing) and I can no longer see his face just his ear. Now it's so dark I can't tell if he has a nice ear, if it's too big or too small or if it sticks out, and By God this must be damn boring if I'm wondering about the relative angles of ear projection rather than what the hell is going on.The framing is really odd, and the eye lines are all over the place, so I don't know who is speaking to who, and often the camera operator decided to be above or below eye-lines, making my head ache as it was so badly composed. The first three scenes of the film could all be cut, or would serve better as flash backs, as they just don't go anywhere at all. OK a bit of back story, but we know the Major wants a medal with a single line of dialogue, not three flipping scenes as dull as a rainy Sunday.The main character Major Blokey-pants was utterly dull and his motivation was all rather thrust down out throats, and I didn't care for him. Only after 90 minutes or so did his wife start talking about some bloke names Percy and I thought ""Who is Percy?"" and I realised it was the main character, who had been referred to as Major something or other (I forget) for the entire rest of the movie.Couple of massive plot holes: they were in the middle of nowhere running low on food on a raft made of branches saying how no white man had ever been here before and clearly in the background is a bloke on a horse in a field. I kept thinking they would pan around and explain but they never did. I also wondered if they were travelling to seek the source of the river, how they were just floating along and not constantly rowing, as a river flows away from the source to the ocean. They have been travelling down river for a year apparently and it all goes wrong and they decide to send this bloke back on a horse. Where did this horse come from?And they are in the middle of the river all weak and dying and the other bloke (Beard-o) says to the main bloke ""and here's a letter from you wife."" FTAF??? Where had he been keeping that then? When we finally get to the WW1 scenes the dead bodies in the trenches are clearly shop window dummies and for a film that is this expensive that is just rubbish. These scenes add absolutely nothing to the film, we could just have had a Voice over which went ""After the first world war, where I saw active service in France and that bloke I knew who was on the trip to Bolivia with me, you know, thingie, was killed, I returned to London...""Eventually we get back to Amazonia for the third time and Major Blokey-pants has bought his son with him this time Blokey-Pants minor, and they bang on about finding this lost city of Zzzz but never does he put forward a reason why he thinks there might be a lost city or indeed, why he is so keen to find it, he just wants to find it. Who were these people? Why did their civilisation die out? what was their favourite past time? Did they like cheese? None of these questions were answered or indeed even asked.Compare this film to the savage Aguirre: The Wrath of God (1972 Herzog) the bonkers Fitzcaraldo (1982 Herzog) or even the rather depressing The Mission (1986 Joffe) and you will be sorely disappointed.",The Lost City of Z

The film could have easily fallen in cliche, but instead took surprising choices in narrative. The cinematography is gorgeous - the swirling colours of the jungle shown as a dream or nightmare. The pacing is very slow, which is not always a problem - but the film could have benefited from a shorter run-time.Fine performances from all the main cast - particularly Robert Pattinson. Charlie Hunnam was apparently not the first (or even the second) casting choice for the lead - but does a good job regardless. He tries to shows inner-complexities here, but the role is quite one-note. The plot is repetitive, but this makes sense in a story of an obsessional quest. Unfortunately some scenes become incoherent - specifically a moment taking place in trench warfare that is almost comically strange. Some would find the ending unsatisfying - but I enjoyed it. A profound and ultimately sombre film.",The Lost City of Z

The best thing about these types of larger than live personalities is that they have the wildest stories. Here the task of showing us the great dangers and the exciting nature of an explorer falls a bit flat. The journey is almost entirely skipped while the wonders of the jungle are reduced to a couple of scenes.This film feels too conflicted with it parallel acts. While the jungle is mysterious and exciting the action taking place in London cant be left out as well. I think we get the bad part of both. Add a family drama to the mix and it becomes too overwhelming for itself. Maybe a mini-series would fit the story better.Another disappointment for Charlie Hunnam, who as usual does a good job but cant seem to find the right project.",The Lost City of Z

140,alex-klein2424,Take Me Back to the City,9,13 June 2017,"You know a movie is powerful when you continually think about it after it is long over. What makes this movie great is showing the lengths someone will go to achieve their dream. As well, it shows how one moment can change the way you look at things in an irreversible way. With all of that said, Lost City of Z is a powerful movie, and one that can't be missed.Charlie Hunnam plays Percy Fawcett, a soldier in England in the early 1900′s and starts out as a tale of redemption. He feels this urge to be something greater because all the soldiers around him have medals and awards and he has none, yet he is better than his peers. We come to find out due to his father his family was in a sense shamed. It is at this point that a group of men in the geographic society task him with charting the jungle in South America. We find out that Percy was an explorer previously and while reluctant, he takes up the offer as a way to clear his family name. Upon going to the jungle he discovers signs of older civilizations deep within and that is where the movie flourishes. At this point he realizes his dream to discover a lost city not just for glories sake, but to further mankind and show to those close minded English that there are older civilizations predating the Empire. This then becomes his life's journey as he makes multiple trips over the course of the movie and his life for which the movie follows almost completely.What makes this movie so great is the power behind it. Told over time and many large events, the filmmaker manages to capture that old world feel and the sense of wonder and grand scale. Shots of lush jungles and desolate battle fields along with various civilizations will have your jaw dropping multiple times. Often times this movie will have you thinking of Apocalypse Now and also in some ways Paths of Glory, but never in a lazy way but with admiration. Charlie Hunnam, along with all the other actors, knock it out of the park. I have not seen Charlie in much except trailers for King Arthur but from what I surmised he seems like a macho action movie guy, but as this was my first real look at him, I saw the makings of a determined actor with heart. This will clearly be known as one of his best performances. Robert Pattinson also stood out to me as he can sometimes seem achy to me just based on what I have seen him in *cough* twilight *cough*. Here he was embodying a completely different person and did excellent work. Tom Holland is also a perfect addition not just because I am a Marvel fan but he does a great job.Overall this movie just oozes with old world charm and grandiose ideas of purpose. It made me want to become an explorer and chase down lost cities, too. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking to visit South America or who enjoys searching for glory. This would also be a good movie to watch on a date but just make sure you eat a proper meal after that would embody an explorers meal.",The Lost City of Z

At times it was interesting enough, but other times seemed to drag and was a bit disjointed. Case in point; the suddenly estranged relationship between father and son and then all of a sudden near the end, the relationship was miraculously repaired and to the point where son was advocating he and Dad go out together and discover the ""fantasy"" his father had been chasing most of the kid's life.

Obviously was supposed to have big themes and deep meaning, but kind of a schizophrenic mix of film noir, nostalgia, gritty crime drama, golden age comic book flash gordon stuff.Although it may not seem all that significant the atmosphere seemed all WWII era film noir, yet the jarringly incongruous soundtrack had music from the 60s and seventies. Dr. Manhattan seems like gee whiz fifties atomic age comic book, but then they try to throw him into deep philosophical discussions. None of the superheroes really have any superpowers except Rorsarch has a freaky mask (never explained to my knowledge) and Dr. Manhattan (who is given some backstory).The old group, the Watchmen, never seemed to really care about each other much, past or present, and none of the characters are really likeable or relateable. Perhaps because the only one we really had any clue about regarding character and motivation was Rorsarch (well played by the way).The violence often seemed gratuitious and unnecessary to the story. The story, I got the general gist, but would have to watch it again (not likely) to get all the twists and nuances and flashbacks they threw in there.

As you watch it, you get the sense that the writers have decided to dramatize much of the actual story and that there are really, really important things missing. I read the Wikipedia entry for Percy Fawcett and, it turns out that they've taken what should have been an exceedingly interesting story and ruined it because they didn't understand what they were working with. What was Fawcett's underlying drive in life? How is it that a man can be motivated to attempt such an arduous and probably fatal task not once, but four times? There's an answer and it is given in one three-second throw away portion early in the film, then ultimately ignored.

150,fahdshakir,"Long-winded, unfocused, unconvincing",3,4 August 2017,"And that was before I looked up the true story and found the plot was based on exaggerations and outright lies. They had me skeptical about historical accuracy with the piranhas which have been shown repeatedly to pose no danger to people, but the real problem were all the melodramatic obscenely tedious scenes. The movie was simply too long and poorly edited. First, for a story about uncharted jungle exploration, the audience never feels any tension from their journeys. One moment, they look like they're sauntering through a compliant and friendly trail, the very next they're dying of mysterious maladies on a raft, somehow at once emaciated and paunchy. Similarly, the hostile Indians they meet are exceptionally accurate with their first dramatic arrow, then storm-trooper incompetent with every other shot. Every issue is resolved almost instantly which gives everything a feeling of in- consequence. Still, the jungle scenes were the only bearable parts of the movie, but even there the movie would have really benefited from just showing one of the excursions, instead of haphazardly traipsing through all three. None of the characters are well developed, and I can't think of any that were even somewhat relate-able. So many scenes should have been cut out. The wife's anguish might have been enough to show the high cost to their family life, but the eldest son's sporadic outbursts were pointless overkill. But again the conflict is resolved so quickly and easily that the melodramatic moments later on hold no gravitas whatsoever. Every single problem Fawcett comes across resolves itself summarily and disappointingly. The entire world war 1 scene could have been cut. It's such a bizarre divergence from the plot that even if there is a semi-prominent character's death in it, all you really remember is the random fortune teller brought to the front lines for some stupid reason.The ending is pretty obvious, but the movie tries to make it out to be some unsolved mystery. Apparently, the actual fate of the real life Fawcett was determined more by his incompetence than the dubious luck the movie would have you believe. Don't bother wasting your time with this movie. Watch Aguirre: Wrath of God, or Fitzcarraldo, or even Apocalypse Now if you want to see how this sort of movie is competently and brilliantly done.",The Lost City of Z
151,robastyk,Ultimately Unsatisfying,6,6 December 2020,"The acting and directing, the evocation of the period are all of high quality. However, the story of a man who makes a discovery only to be dragged away from it by events beyond his control is a worthy subject. Had the script spent more time on the events leading up to the initial discovery and then told us briefly of the frustrating ending there might well have been a story with some dramatic impact. Unfortunately the last third of the movie simply carries us down hill to a conjectural ending that might better have been a closing title. Sienna Miller gets far too little screen time. Her role as the rock holding a family together would have made a fair movie better had she been more significant in the story.
As I watched this film I kept thinking of the nearly contemporary Endurance expedition of Ernest Shackleton. It too was a mission frustrated by failure. Still, the story of the return from that failed mission is infinitely more dramatic than the mission itself. The returns from the Amazon jungle might well have been equally interesting but they had no place in this movie.

This one dispenses with that, however, and characters appear at midpoints in scenes as though they were always there. It is a REALLY weird directorial or editing decision! Maybe it had to do with the film's budget...but it was very strange.With all that said, what really killed this film dead for me is it's heavy handed moralizing.If you love being lectured as you watch movies...then this one is for you.If you're looking for a somewhat realistic story, decent acting and some sense of being entertained — then run from this one as fast as you possibly can.",The Lost City of Z

161,sil328,So clunky and filled with holes,1,10 March 2019,"I normally watch even bad films through to the end in case they either get better or are so bad they are good. however, I think this is the first film I have ever watched where after an hour and ten minutes I was so disinterested that I just gave up. This was not only because of the pace of the film, but also because there were just so many mistakes with the editing, the story, the character's behaviour, the timelines, plausibility - almost everything really. For example (in no particular order):1. They are on a hunt, the stag they are chasing heads one way, then our hero decides to veer off to one side to enter a forest. Why? 'Don't do it!' cries a colleague. Why? Miraculously the stag seems to have magically appeared in this forest and evidently stands conveniently still rather than running off when he hears the horse coming, and so no sooner has Fawcett entered the forest than he is able to take a good shot at it and kill it. After this, he is feted as a hero by all and sundry. Again, why? None of it made sense.
2. Two horses with riders fall over as they chase the stag. Why?
3. Fawcett and his wife are lying next to each other talking in bed. She raises herself up and says something. Then the camera cuts to a different angle and suddenly she is sitting up half way down the bed. Clunky editing!
4. Fawcett first meets Henry Costin on the ship, but only after, for no reason at all, Costin stalks him on the boat and Fawcett hides behind a door to catch him. Huh? And this after already being on the boat for a week? Huh? Both knew they would be working together so why not just say hello on day 1? Made no sense at all.
5. The raft manged to float upwater, no paddling required.
6. Random people appeared on the raft who were suddenly crew members.
7. One crew member randomly threatens our leader with a huge knife for no reason. He has the knife up against his throat. Camera cuts to another angle and now he is lunging from a distance, giving time for Costin to shoot him in the ear (huh?). Then we never see that man again. Made no sense.
8. Natives kill a disposable crew member with the first arrow. They then launch what seems like 100 arrows a minute at the raft and can't hit anybody. Fawcett stands there with his arms open and every arrow misses him, and all the other crew members too. He holds a book up to his face and an arrow then conveniently hits the book. He stays there, relying on their good nature not to hit him again. Has he got a death wish? That isn't bravery, it is stupidity.
9. They reach the source of the river, thousands of miles upstream, on what seems like Day 2 of their journey. It turns out to be a big waterfall. Did they not think that maybe the river carries on back from above the waterfall?
10. James Murray is supposed to have been Shackleton's 2nd in command but is fat, and in the jungle a complete wimp, unable to carry his pack without moaning it was too heavy. He then decides it is safer to run away rather than stay with his colleagues. All completely unrealistic.
11. At the scientific academy presentation, half the room seems to be jeering and mocking Fawcett's proposal that there were advanced civilisations in the jungle right up until the last minute, then he says one thing and they all, in unison, cheer wildly and throw their hats in the air. Huh?
12. In the jungle, Fawcett gets a letter from his wife advising he has had a son. First he gets Costin to read it because it would be too 'painful to read' (huh?), then he learns he has a son and barely reacts, then he take the letter and burns it in the fire. Why?
13. Half way down the river a crew member suddenly gets out some more letters from family and hands them round. Why not do this when the letters first arrived?
14. Fawcett gets back from his first trip and his son, who looks about 3 months older than when he left, now doesn't recognise him.
15. What was the point of the 'opera in the jungle' scene? Why did they bring fully costumed European opera singers to the jungle?
16. Fawcett appears to speak the language of everyone he encounters, including remote Amazon tribes people. Totally implausible.
17. His native assistant speaks Spanish but understands English perfectly but can't speak English. Why not? Fawcett understands English and can speak Spanish but only talks to him in English. Huh?
18. If you thought the trip to the source of the Amazon was quick, the trip back was so quick you didn't even see it. He turned away from the waterfall towards the raft then bingo, suddenly, he was in England.
19. At one point as Fawcett was pushing the raft to shore, a man in jeans leading a horse on the riverbank was clearly in shot for a good few seconds, right over his shoulder. Who was he? Where did the horse come from? If he wasn't supposed to be there how could the cameraman, director and editor all failed to have seen him, and what was he there for?I could go on. There were just so many plausibility issues you could not enjoy the film as a narrative. I could also see that the film was so badly edited that the enjoyment was being sucked out of it. I couldn't see it through to the finish. My journey ended.",The Lost City of Z

I was taken on a journey and carried graciously as a passenger privileged to see what this explorer saw and experience some of what he felt. And not just him. The story conveyed the emotion of all the central characters - usually without words. I was pleased with the direction and content. The film did not rely on excess and exaggerated action to tell its tale. Highly entertaining. Highly recommended. Memorable and well done.,The Lost City of Z

164,seawolfvii,Unremarkable Film for a Remarkable Life,6,22 September 2017,"I enjoy the idea of bringing to life real-life adventurers/explorers. I understand there will be some artistic license in the story-telling (writing), cinematography, and editing. I read the book prior to seeing the movie. It was pure circumstance that the movie was out in a near-by theater just as I had finished the book. And as a final precursory note, I had started the book a while ago and don't remember all the details so I can't say to what degree it followed the general story of the book only that it did not seem to as much. Which, yes, tends to be the way of things. Though I think the book was very good, tough to put together so many pieces of research and story but still good.Possible Spoilers Alert It was a rather long movie (2:21) for having communicated so little to the audience. You had to ""piece together"" much of what was said, with what you saw (or think you saw) on the screen. There was much left to doubt. But so much that could have been communicated with perhaps a story teller/narrator. I mean tell us names of tribes, uniqueness of tribes, locations (more than were told), etc... Use the story-telling like in ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" where he was journeying into the mountains in search of Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn). You know with the journal entry on screen, the music and the video.I wasn't expecting an action-packed, archaeological thrill ride of Indiana Jones proportion but take lessons from ""The Medicine Man"", ""The Emerald Forest"" or other similar Amazonian films and tell us more what's going on. Tell us those are maggots eating his flesh, not just there is disease and such. I think Percy, Jack and Jack's close friend Raleigh were adventuring together but Raleigh was no where to be found. Sure a nice touching story of father and son but still. And it would have been fine to end with the ""Find a place for their spirits"" if you have given use the desperation and hopelessness, the lack of closure that his wife, son (Brian) and daughter felt. Brian, in the book, went looking for his father, brother and Raleigh. You wouldn't have to spend more than 15 minutes on ""Brian"" (maybe at the end when Percy and Jack were ""being killed???"") but it could have given the audience the sense of mystery, desperation and emptiness that surrounded the lives of his mother and sister at not knowing for sure if Fawcett, or Jack, were dead or alive.But I guess no one likes to learn from movies anymore, no one likes a truly great story. Or maybe the movie makers just didn't pull it off.Lastly, movies that end with script on the screen are, in my opinion, are a lazy way to finish and often more of a let-down than in support of the story. Give us a ""vision"" of what Brian saw in his mind that was the lost city of ""Z"" instead of a paltry script on a movie screen. You know, have him standing there in a tribal village, and have the camera pan-out into a drone-view traveling along the ancient city like in the book, ""I began to picture the flutists and dancers in one of the old plazas. I pictured them living in mound-shaped two-story houses, the houses not scattered but in endless rows, ... I pictured the dancers crossing moats and passing through tall palisade fences, moving from one village to the next along wide boulevards and bridges and causeways"" (from the book) with some appropriate wording, maybe lines from Fawcett's journal, or some of the quotes his referenced from other authors. But the ending was very anti-climatic instead. So much potential...such a remarkable explorer, considered one of the last great solo explorers, and yet such an unremarkable film.",The Lost City of Z

There many characters that seems to vanish without sense and the encounter with the natives at the amazonian jungle are absurd and implausible under the conditions shown.

It is moving without being sentimental and is a genuine attempt to understand the attitudes and motivations of a bygone age that authentically evokes the time in which it is set.

Based on a true story, it paints a vivid picture not only of the Amazonian region which Percy Fawcett and his men set out to explore, but also of the Western society they came from, but in a fairly balanced way - this didn't feel like another case of 'weren't Western white people before 1980 all absolutely dreadful' but rather a portrayal of a society with its own beliefs and attitudes (as all societies have) faced with the prospect of discovering another, much older, civilisation.This wouldn't be a film for fans of action movies as such.

181,animausimages,A journey worth discovering,9,6 July 2017,"2017's ""The Lost City of Z"", written and directed by James Gray.Starring Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson, Sienna Miller, Tom Holland, Angus MacFadyen, Edward Ashley, Clive Francis, and Ian McDiarmid. Based off of the novel, ""The Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon"" by David Grann, ""LCoZ"" is about the real life geographer/archaeologist/artillery officer Percy Fawcett (played by Charlie Hunnam). Fawcett was commissioned to explore and survey parts of South America for the National Geographic Society starting in 1906, and over multiple trips Fawcett came to believe that a great historic city lay undiscovered deep in the Amazon jungle. He called it Z, but it was believed to be the fabled city of El Dorado. Not content to be a world class explorer, Fawcett also served in WWI, and had 3 children (1 of whom is played by Tom Holland) with his wife (Sienna Miller). Fawcett's life was such that Arthur Conan Doyle used some of Fawcett's field reports for his novel, ""The Lost World"". Coming off of the excellent 2013's ""The Immigrant"", director James Gray brings more of the same vintage 70's look to the picture, with characters appearing to be lit by chiaroscuro oil lamps when in interiors. But don't be mistaken by the retro formalism: Gray brings some of the most chaotic jungle footage ever filmed, making lovers of ""Aguire: Wrath of God"" or ""Apocalypse Now"" with plenty to swoon over. Casting Hunnam as Fawcett, a man who has plenty to prove from an absent father who sullied the family name, proves fruitful. Hunnam's intensity comes across especially well as a man of intellect and confidence who never seems to panic, no matter how treacherous the river, how unfriendly the aboriginals, or hypocritically civilized when back home. Equally inspired is Fawcett's leading man, played wonderfully low key by Robert Pattinson. Serving as a toilet brush to the feces smear that is the Twilight series, Pattinson's work here (along with 2012's Cosmopolis) shows he can do more than stare vacantly at mortal girls. Miller is also good as the wife who is far smarter than society thinks she is, but understands her family members' calls to exploration and bloodless conquest. Gray expertly navigates the decades of time depicted here condensed into 3 trips to the Amazon (with a detour into service in WWI), and he very much crafts something here that is a tribute to the spirit of adventure. Hunnam is shown as a man who has little options for himself as he goes about satisfying others, but by the end he would probably do the adventuring for free by himself if it meant he could be in the jungle, where the veneer of polite society is stripped away in favour of a more simplistic fatalism. The spirit to explore proves infectious, as Hunnam attracts followers throughout the movie, for better or worse. ""LCoZ"" also features a scene that is a manual as to why I love cinema. Combining the poet Rudyard Kipling with a montage proves to be both beautiful and effective. As in past films, Gray brings subtle societal undercurrents to the fold, always in the background as the characters go about their daily motivations. True to life, Gray keeps the ending ambiguous but likely, as we observe Fawcett- he has finally found himself. 4.5/5For more work, check out: https://animausimages.blogspot.ca/",The Lost City of Z

The movie does not have the hook that the book did. Like many other reviews stated, the screenplay is seriously lacking. Instead of doing creative storytelling, the movie does a very linear story and tries to cover as much of Percy's life as possible rather than focusing on his goal of finding the lost city.I was surprised how little we were actually in the jungle, as the story chose to focus on Percy's home life and the Great War, as well as his dealings with the Royal Geographic Society. What I did not feel as a viewer was that I was in the Amazon Rainforest. The film made it seemingly easy to communicate with local tribes to get information and like they would definitely find something if they kept looking. The movie does a terrible job at revealing the vastness of the jungle. I visited the Amazon on a trip to Ecuador and hiking through it and looking around, it is so possible that there is a lost city there because there is SO MUCH to explore. But the movie almost made it too believable.I would love to see a remake of this in 20 years with more creativity and cinematic power instead of, essentially, a biopic.",The Lost City of Z

After all, filming on 35mm, having a sizeable budget, and all these huge time leaps are not easy challenges. And yet, I found Hunnam's acting awkward and uncomfortable. Does he always tilt his head to the left? He truly gives off the impression of trying to play someone much larger, in presence and charisma. Mr. Costin was far more believable character, as was Mr. Murray, even if you loved to hate him. Jack Fawcett was perhaps the most painful, not just for his acting but also the film's attempts to first make him appear a young boy, then a resentful adolescent (obviously his most natural state), then finally a young adult (massive fake squared-off jaw prosthetics).

Neverless, they tried. While I will say they did not fail, it was simply not, in the end, compelling. The characters were engaging, if not stuffy and the film simply never reached its zenith. I found myself confused in the middle and toward the end of the film- but not on purpose by the filmmaker. When a script has both teeth and lacks some, you tend to only remember the gaps.

195,jordanrossreviews,"""A beautiful film of the life of a brave explorer, with a few debatable changes.""",7,12 October 2017,"JordanRossReviews: The Lost City of Z – 7/10 Rating: PG-13 | Family Friendly: No. 13+ | How to Watch: StreamingPercy Fawcett's story was one I had no prior knowledge of, yet I found inspiring and adventurous as it was told through The Lost City of Z. I can't remember a film I've seen that began with the story of a cartographer, which I thought was an interesting call-to-adventure deep in the Amazonia. A story like this one stirs my explorer's spirit, but then quickly douses the boy-like fantasy as it reminds how dangerous these explorations could be. Charlie Hunnam cast as the British explorer was a decision that was questionable to me, although I found out that Benedict Cumberbatch was originally supposed to play the role which would've have been much more fitting. I'm not sure if Hunnam is just too American, but his accent seemed a little unnatural. Although at times I thought he really sold the character, there were others when I felt he just wasn't the best choice for this role. I think he could handle the spirit of the character, but it was more of an issue with his look. Not the worst casting, just not the best. That being said, the casting of the supporting roles were great, and it may have just been me who took a moment to recognize Robert Pattinson as Henry Costin under that thick beard.My favorite aspect of this film was the cinematography from Darius Khondji. Director James Gray made a decision to shoot with 35mm film which I enjoyed immensely. From Cork, Ireland and London, England to the wilds of the Amazonia the scenes were beautiful. Every shot was rich in color and had wonderful contrast. Gray had a vision that he executed with richness and beauty with Khondji. Although the decision to shoot with the 35mm cost the production an additional seven-hundred and fifty thousand dollars and logistical issues I think it was more than worth it in the end. The largest issue I had with the film was the script. At times and certain scenes I thought the characters motivation and direction was clear, but other times I wasn't so sure. For example the obsessiveness of Fawcett in finding his lost city seemed under- explained. I wasn't sure of why he even called it the city of Z until I did my own research. For a man willing to leave his family and life behind he had to have more reason to go back to the dangerous amazon. Historically I found that the story of Fawcett was changed a lot, and Gray focused more on the characters then the actual adventure which gave me even more reason to want a more historically accurate tale. The scope of the film was huge from the beginning and I think it was inspiring. In the end The Lost City of Z was a beautiful tale of exploration and sacrifice, yet could've held truer to the actual events. Even though I didn't agree with the casting of Charlie Hunnam it was a decent pick when Benedict Cumberbatch had to back out, although I still wish it was a British actor to take the role. The soundtrack was fitting with the amazing photography and the tale of such bravery into the wilds of the jungle rekindled my own sense of adventure. A challenging film to make and one that I'm glad I spent the time to watch.

196,Detri_Mantela,"Is based on real life, unfortunately.",6,12 October 2020,"For some reason when I watch movies based on real events I tend to forget that they are based on real events. Even worse - it looks like my mind does everything to not notice words like ""biography"", ""based on true story"", ""true-life drama"", etc. So all the movies I watched that were based on true story were watched by me who wasn't aware of the fact they are based on true story - it always is something I find out afterwards (the main reason for that is my lack of research before watching a movie - on the other hand why movies don't state it in the very beginning of a film as they did before?). This movie wasn't an exception. I thought I am about to witness some modern version of Indiana Jones, a picture full of discoveries and action but what I got is just expensive and clumsy depiction of quite boring and fruitless fragment of some failed artist.The plot. Somewhere in the middle of the movie I suspected it to be a book adaptaion considering how clumsy and pushed the main plot felt. It felt as though this movie was supposed to be 10 hours long and they had to cut out 80% of the initial material.The cast. The cast is definitely overkill aimed to attract viewers. I can't say Charlie Hunnam and Robert Pattinson (let alone Tom Holland) brought anything valubale (in terms of artistic value) to the table any other actor woudn't be able to.The final. The conclusion of the movie definitely left me dissapointed but the second I realised the film is based on real events I reconciled with the frustrating ending and even more: I forgave the overall problems of the plot. I am sure the writers tried to be as close to the real events as possisble that's why everything turned out to be so dull. Real life is boring. That's why I rated it 6/10 and not 5/10 or less despite basically saying how everything was bad throughout my whole ""review"" - I am sure if I knew ""The Lost City of Z"" is based on real events I would enjoy the picture more and would be more forgivable.",The Lost City of Z
197,joao-madrid,Average Hollywood (Play Safe) Film.,6,26 March 2017,"3 / 5 - While the story the originated the film is remarkable and worth knowing, the movie and script are too obvious and do not explore the real complexity of a character such as the British explorer Percy Fawcett.I personally see two ways of dealing with jungle exploration films. You can follow the classic adventure style, think of Indiana Jones, or you can do something more serious like Aguirre and Embrace of the Serpent. I do not know if we had a clear direction in this film. It tries to verge into a more serious and tense moments to suddenly goes all Hollywood action packed.The acting is quite below average and even the script is just OK. Nevertheless, the film is still watchable and you do get some nice images from Amazon forest.",The Lost City of Z

But it's still enjoyable for those who like this type of storytelling. My favorite thing is the performances of the actors involved, especially Mr. Hunnam.

201,rafolejniczak-65111,For the Explorers at Heart,8,2 January 2021,"A high quality and well casted movie. The sets and extras (actors) are particularly impressive. I love how the movie captured the topic of exploration, adventure, as well as the topic of family.It spands about 20 years, jumping between South American exploration, life back in England, and through World War 1. It's a lot to pack into 2 hours and 20 minutes. I felt that some of the cuts through location / time were disconnecting and confusing, but that's the only negative for me.I think this movie is underated at the time of my review at 6.6/10 based on
78,409 submissions. It also seems to not have done great at the box office. I think potentially this is going to be one of those hidden finds for many people, as it was for me.Robert Pattinson plays an interesting role and shows a lot of versility as an actor compared to his Twilight era. I was surprised to see that Brad Pitt as an executive producer and that he intially was meant to be the leading role. I think Charlie Hunnam did an amazing job.If you're looking for a movie about exploration, adventure and drama, this is it. Bonus that it's based on a true story.",The Lost City of Z

To me, it looked like a more realistic version of Indiana Jones, if that makes sense. As I watched the movie, however, I quickly realized that this was more of a drama than a adventure story. But that was fine with me. I sat back and enjoyed myself as much as I could. This movie is really interesting in the way it talks about how far a man's obsession with something will take him. How much will someone give up to gain recognition? In that sense, I enjoyed this film. The acting was also pretty strong all around. Everyone gives a decent performance. One of my main gripes with this movie is the lack of a climax. The movie just kinda ends. It's not that we don't get a sense of closure. It's that this entire movie is building and building and building, and then just ends before we get to what we were building to. I guess this may have been the point, but I just felt like this film had no climax. I'm glad I saw it, but I will probably never watch it again. Unless I'm watching with someone who hasn't seen it yet maybe.",The Lost City of Z

The British ""accent"" he uses makes Costner's in Robin Hood seem Oscar worthy. He is offered a job as a cartographer to find the source of an Amazonian river. The act would bring him the honor and prestige that he is seeking.Despite supposedly heading up river to the source, the travel in a wooden raft with no propulsion and travel downstream. The small vessel does not seem to have any supplies loaded on it at all. The journey is supposed to take over a year, yet Hunnam's facial hair does not grow at all, despite his crew mates growth. Without provisions they try to fish the river, which is seemingly overrun with piranhas with no other fish to be found.At the source of the river they finally bring out their map making equipment. They find some pottery from an ancient civilization and head back, again downriver.Back in England he convinces a sponsor to send him back to find a city of gold he calls Zed. During the return, again downriver, they are attacked by natives who are soothed by a song to stop attacking.It all seems to get worse from there. The whole production was just so boring and silly. The ""climax"" itself was so very expected and droll.I think that after this movie and the awful King Arthur flick, it appears that Hunnam should have stuck to television, not be the lead, or fire his agent.",The Lost City of Z

Since I didn't read the book, I had no expectations and was able to enjoy the movie for what it was-a great adventure/drama. It breaks my heart to see such a wonderful movie do so poorly in the box office. It shows that you really have to look sometimes to find the good stuff. It was a truly engrossing movie that felt immersive to see on the big screen. I enjoyed every minute of it.

206,tigereyes3,Such a Disappointment,1,28 April 2018,"After reading the book this film was based on, I was so excited to hear it was being made into a feature film with Brad Pitt as the star no less. I see now why Brad had the good sense to bow out of this project. I have to say the acting and cinematography was fine, the script is what sinks this in the mud.
The book went into detail about Fawcett learning his explorers trade at the RGS and made it so fascinating! The film touched on the most mundane minutia of Fawcett's time with the RGS. It made me wonder why they even bothered with it at all? Most of all I was ready for a great Jungle story with all its horrors and heroics.
It was as if someone read this wonderful adventure book, picked out the boring bits ( there weren't many ) and made a film with the same name. Like filming War and Peace with the ""War"" left out. The book made sense of everything the film didn't. The why's and the reasoning behind everything Fawcett and Nina did. The book also told the story of the author's research, a back story almost as interesting as Fawcett's.
Facts that were intentionally deleted to make the film more appealing. Such as Fawcett being bald in his twenties. The lush head of hair Mr Hunnam sported, bothered me as much as if you had an actor with Dreadlocks play Winston Churchill. The WW1 trench scenes, the ""over the top"" charge, in reality never happened. Fawcett was an artillery Lieutenant Colonel pushing 50 and never got close enough to the front lines for any of those clichéd heroics. That's even if the brass would have let him try them in the first place.
Lastly Fawcett's Son's friend Raleigh Rimmel who went along on the last expedition was totally left out? As I sat there wondering why such a Great story was so disfigured, the scene in the native village is shown, Walmart Tiki torches with wicks, lining the way to the river! Really? Maybe today but Not in 1925. I guess what is so maddening is this could have been another Bridge over the River Kwai or Lawrence of Arabia. Instead it's a boring, talky, overly long non-epic destined to be forgotten.",The Lost City of Z
207,rsn711,"Not perfect by any means, but well worth your time.",8,29 August 2017,"James Gray's ""The Lost City of Z"" (pronounced 'Zed', to my chagrin) is a contemplative study of purpose and what drives us to seek what we see as our destiny. Subverting the expectations of the viewer, Gray takes us deep within the Amazonian jungle only to frustratingly yank us back just as we get used to our surroundings. Each time we get closer to where we think the film is taking us, until we are thrust back out again. The same can be said for Charlie Hunnam's Percy Fawcett on his quest to find his lost city.Hunnam proves capable of shouldering the weight of the lead performance, an irony due to the simultaneous presence of his King Arthur movie in theaters. But he deserves the credit he is being given for this film, as I haven't enjoyed a performance of his this much since his time on Undeclared (and I suffered through all seven seasons of Sons of Anarchy). Robert Pattinson gives an understated yet powerful performance as Fawcett's aide-de-camp, Mr. Costin, and seems to be on quite the ascent in his career right now.Not perfect by any means, but well worth your time, The Lost City of Z provokes discussion at its conclusion. Apt, as the themes explored in the movie do not fit neatly inside a box, wrapped up tightly with a bow.

As for Angus Macfadyen; he obviously thought he was in a different movie entirely. Three times during this film Fawcett travels to the Bolivian jungle yet we barely learn anything about the place or his expeditions. The director skips hastily from one badly written scene to another with all the depth of a Stephenie Meyer novel. This film is an episodic series of set pieces, many of which should have been left in a heap on the cutting room floor; the entire WW1 sequence brings absolutely nothing to the story except filling quarter of an hour of screen time with clichéd dialogue and hackneyed visuals.

220,Prin23,Rather boring for something that should be the opposite.,2,4 November 2017,"For a film that deals with the matters of exploration throughout South American rain forest and jungles in the early 20th century, this film was exceedingly boring and unevenly paced, causing me to pause it numerous times and finish it the next day, today from my initial start last night. The story focuses on real life British explorer Percy Fawcett as he attempts to discover a lost city of immense wealth and power, filled to the brim with native South Americans that would prove to the ho-hum people of ""civilized"" society that not only does civilization as a concept not belong only to ""white men"" but it was derived far earlier by those considered to be savages.With that premise, you would think the film would be exciting with many perilous scenes, yet throughout the run time I was left wanting, wanting a better script, better score, better characters, and a better premise to be honest. The run time is well over 2 hours and does not justify it. Each scene barely transfers into the next one, instead leaving the audience with a hobbled mess of mismatched scenes that are barely relevant to each other. For instance, the scenes in the Trenches during WWI had no bearing upon the rest of the film other than to show the audience why Major Fawcett was given the rank of Lt. Colonel. It had no relevance whatsoever on the plot other than that tidbit which should not have mattered, and the ten or so minutes it focused on this major part of World History, merely seemed to provide us with a very cheery portrayal instead of the grim and downright ugly truth. Instead, we are treated to a ""psychic"" that tells Fawcett his destiny is to find this lost city, then a boring and melodramatic speech about fighting for each other which I have seen done better in other films, before a quick and dramatized rendition of Fawcett's unit storming Germans and their artillery post, before stopping due to a slo-mo shot of Fawcett succumbing to gas after he just told one of his comrades about it. Just plain stupid.The acting was well done and Charlie Hunnam as well as Robert Pattinson should be congratulated at the very least for not turning in their performances as they could have but giving a little more effort than others around them.The score as mentioned previously was practically nonexistent and certainly not memorable and even as I type this, I am having a hard time remembering if there even was one, which really is rather poor on the music department and the director and producers for their lackluster effort.My main complain other than this film being boring is the lack of any progress. I read a bit on the real Percy Fawcett and shrugged my shoulders, as reading what I did and watching the film made it seem to me that this was not material worthy of going on film as nothing of substance was ever accomplished due to these explorations others than a few jottings on pieces of paper. I would much rather have walked around in the local park near me for two hours with a journal than to ever see this film again.A lackluster effort but what else can be expected from Amazon Studios.

In the movie he ages significantly 2 or 3 times and changes his performance each time. His character, also, is one of the larger + for me. An interesting man attracted by medals and achievements, changes at once when on a surveying mission in Bolivia. He grows as a character and see beneath the shallow of the 'Indians'. I think the sudden fast forwards in time were very clever as I found myself not being sure was the character dreaming or was it reality.On the negatives I felt that the relationship between Fawcett and Costin wasn't given enough time. We only see a little bit of interaction between them and in the final scenes it is clear that they have developed a brotherly relationship, we're sort of thrown into that. Another things is that I found the plot of the movie to be rather predictable and sometimes unengaing.

Occasionally but briefly in intricate detail, but predominantly with a general lack of substance. To return to my analogy, I imagined myself at one point saying ""That's incredible! Tell me how you felt at that moment, did you realise right then the magnitude of your discovery? Tell me about the gruelling journey home, was it fraught with peril?"" Only for the storyteller to continue.. ""So I arrived back in London..."".No! Please give me more details. I've dedicated over two hours of my life to hear your story, but I've come away with roughly the same amount of information as I could've gleaned from the back of a primary-school student's pencil case. You know, like the ones that just have a time-line with monarchs' names or some such alongside, but are lacking in any further description.On the plus side, it was quite nicely shot at points although it did feel as if this, coupled with the apparent fact that this film was shown in selected, more 'prestigious' and therefore expensive theatres/screens were little more than candid narcissism and was tantamount to the director pleasuring himself in my face for the price of my £16 ticket. Additionally, and somewhat bizarrely, the first 20% of the film had a near-constant and somewhat mediocre musical score, immediately followed by a scene wherein some mediocre opera playing within earshot of the characters could be easily mistaken for a continuation of said score. This was intrusive and unnecessary, and although it didn't continue throughout the duration of the film, this did not excuse its inclusion in the first place.Due to the lack of detail or any attempt at interconnection between what I shall continue to refer to as 'the episodes' with a deliberate lack of capitalisation as I don't consider them worthy of a title, alongside abrupt changes in setting, the experience could also be likened to that of being held hostage in a stranger's living room as they mindlessly alternate channels between a Channel5 period drama and a recap of a Blue Peter trip to the Amazon told from the perspective of a donkey wearing blinkers, such is the lack of momentum and detail. Dialogue is painfully slow and, were this not the case, the running time could've been significantly shortened or better still been put to good use in filling in at least some of the notably absent detail. I am an advocate of a move away from the 90minute format of most films but this does nothing to support that argument.There is also a borderline-distasteful adoration of Fawcett's alleged delivery of faux-profound proclamations worthy of being printed on the back of a market-stall iPhone case. I am left unsure of whether this was artistic licence or if Fawcett really was that much of a nob. Similarly, little reference is made of his questionable attitude toward the role and capability of women or his insistence upon prioritising the recognition of his peers and reclaiming of the status of his family name over the emotional well-being of his dependants.Ultimately, his blind faith led only by local legend and a randomly placed Russian fortune teller, and failure to commit to his children led Fawcett either to his death and that of his son or, according to this film, to his decision to remain in the utopia he may have discovered, thus abandoning his wife and remaining children and leaving them only with a faint hope that he survived. The former is likely more plausible, though the latter would come as no surprise.In summary The Lost City of Z is a vacuous, self-indulgent and ultimately forgettable portrayal of what may have been a great man, but likely was the exploration equivalent of a modern-day philosophy student embarking upon a degree in order to suspend the responsibilities of adult life.Recommended as an alternative to viewing your Auntie's slide show of sunburn-heavy holiday snaps from her latest trip to Alicante or similar Sun holiday destination.",The Lost City of Z

It strays away from the typical adventure movie formula, which often feeds a colonialist attitude towards unknown lands. The film instead undermines this trope, opting for a personal, spiritual look into the protagonist's obsessive journey to lands surrounding the Amazon. This is not merely a quest to find a lost city, but one that questions numerous aspects of our lives - family, marriage, social culture, mortality - and pushes for a meaningful outlook. With such a wide range of themes to touch upon, the movie can feel meandering and sluggish, but the impact of this one stayed with me long after its beautiful ending shot.",The Lost City of Z
237,alejandros15,Great Inside Adventure,8,3 July 2017,"The latest movie from the great director James Gray. This time with his most ambitious film to date, in terms of production. Based on real facts, and at the same time adaptation of the novel of David Grann, tells the story of the British explorer Percy Fawcett, who at the beginning of the 20th Century participated in several expeditions to the Amazonas. I have read several reviews from the critics and the public, and there is a differentiating trend, the critics praises it and the public hates it. Something common in the movies of James Gray too, but reading the synopsis several expected a great adventure film with lots of action, and clearly were disappointed. In cases like these the role of criticism is appreciated, because the film is a delight. I felt it as a great adventure, but clearly Gray puts his stamp, is a specialist in taking apparently traditional arguments, and delve into them in unusual ways, achieving great results author. The Lost City of Z is not just an adventurous journey, it is the portrait of an obsession, and a passion, and how it leads us to drag everything in our path, even our dearest ones. I found it great, excellently done, with its usual elegance and classicism; It is also beautiful and terribly devastating. It lasts more than two hours but never goes down, and I personally kept myself in suspense and suffering in many moments. Of adventure and its dangers, betrayal, friendship, war, family, and the cruel uneasiness of life, tinged with vile hope. It's James Gray, one of the great live filmmakers.",The Lost City of Z

Now, I didn't had any expectations of this movie, yet alone that it is based on true story. The whole story seemed so incredible, yet I had never heard about this man or his expeditions. Actors were convincing,and could really give those deep emotional moments in a non cheesy way. Cinematography was really good especially at the ending part. I am not gona spoil anything from the plot (the less you know the better). The only thing that bothered me was when they were supposed to be going upstream but in the movie logic they were going down stream.I haven't written a single movie review in my life, but the first best rated review came from a ""tool"" who felt offended by 1 feminist remark in the movie.

But if you want to see a quite,yet passionate story about a man, his dream and what it takes to live this dream, you definitely enjoy this film.This film has a magic in it too. I can still see this magical conversation between enslaved but free spirited ""Indian"" and free but enslaved in his vision of world ""English"". And these last scenes of Nina with this compass, and Fawcett with his son, both taken to their destiny... This was magic. And then there was a brutal reality of a human kind. Sharp words and deadly bullets. This apology that James Murray demanded from Fawcett and to whom this apology was given in the end. It was such a powerful scene. The way Arthur Manley was shot.... It looked so ordinary, nothing prepares you to this scene. Cause this is the war and people get shot in it. Man down, move on. The whole cast gave their souls to those characters. I can just list every one. Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson (forget this damned Twilight already, he is so past it!), Sienna Miller,Edward Ashley, Angus Macfadyen, Tom Holland.

Historically wise, as it claims to be based on ""true facts"", it's extremely unrealistic, very biased and historically inaccurate. First of all, since when, did the Indians, with their bows and arrows, became stronger than the Englishmen in the 1900s with their multitude of fire weapons?? Secondly, OK, there are certain diseases which an European can be exposed to in a jungle like Amazon, such as yellow fever, but, did you know in truth it were the Indians who died most from a myriad of diseases brought to America by Europeans?? This movie doesn't even scratch the subject, and that's the only truth there is to it. Anyways, in short, the ""savages"" and the ""dangerous forest"" are the bad guys and the poor, fragile British men, venture in this hostile territory looking for the unknown. Also, as far as the plot goes, this is a bloody long movie and the story is disappointing in my opinion, and it's boring at times.

247,edwards-52118,Unconvincing,4,31 March 2017,This film lost all credibility when the expedition party were shown crossing the Atlantic on what looked like a 1950s cross channel steamer. Also clips were shown of an English Great Western Railway Castle class locomotive built in the 1930s with a train of 1960s carriages which was supposed to be the train on which they were travelling through Bolivia. British built locomotives were sold to Bolivia but not this type and anyway it was 30 years too modern. Although there do not appear to be any heritage railways using steam locos operating in Bolivia it would have been easy to arrange a shot of the steam locomotive hauled trains in Ecuador or even an Amerian steam tourist line such as the Cumbres and Toltec which uses convincing looking locos. Mistakes like this are lazy and contribute to a shoddy production. And by the way Stoke Canon is not by the sea or even on the Exe estuary.,The Lost City of Z

Not my first time here though I'm always reading the reviews before watching a movie. I just found it very hard to believe how badly this movie was received so, I had to see for myself, not something I regularly do. I have to say, all the bad reviews were spot on. This was one of the worst movies that I've ever wasted this much time on. The pace of this movie is so slow that it was very hard to to hold my attention or to even stay awake. The script was so very bad and the music score was terrible, it never seemed to match what was happening at the time. I literally had to force myself to watch it to the end, hoping that it would finally get better but, it didn't. And then there was the ending, I don't think it could have possibly ended any worse. I was left with the feeling of being cheated out of 2 hours of my life for nothing. There was absolutely no feeling of satisfaction for the wasted hours hoping that it would pick up and get better. Don't do what I did and try to give this movie a chance, just pass this one by and find another movie to watch,you'll be a lot happier.",The Lost City of Z
251,timothycrouch-77902,A stunningly shot and classically told story,10,24 March 2017,"This is a wonderful film that restores faith in the traditional art of movie making. Richly shot on 35mm by DoP Darius Khondji, every frame feels like an exquisite painting, carefully constructed by a filmmaker at the top of his game in James Gray. The backdrops of England, the Western Front and Amazonia all have interest on every inch of the screen and yet for all this color and texture, it is the characters that leave you thinking long after exiting the theater.Charlie Hunnam, as Col. Percy Fawcett, is adequate and measured, but it is star turns from Sienna Miller (Percy's wife), Robert Pattinson (companion Henry Costin), and a ruddy cheeked and opulent Angus MacFadyen (wealthy explorer James Murray) that make the film. The haunting struggle and draw of the jungle and the world Percy leaves behind is revealed through committed portrayals of three dimensional characters who are both authentic to their era and yet still relevant in 2017. And that is the theme that is so skillfully woven throughout the film by Gray, the conflict of portraying the ""other"" as whole and independent in a world that simplifies and condescends. That Gray could make a story about an early 20th Century British explorer resonate so profoundly with the world we live in today, shows that this is his finest work to date. All lovers of cinema should see it, but anyone able see it from a beautiful 35mm print should definitely not miss the opportunity. This is filmmaking as it is supposed to be.",The Lost City of Z

253,herveherve,The Lost Art of Script Writing,1,28 March 2017,"This is the first review I have ever contributed to IMDb which I use on a regular basis to inform my viewing choices but I feel compelled to write it as the high ratings are so unjustified I feel I have a duty to share my experience and balance the 7.4 (!!!!) score. I went into this with high expectations... every ingredient was present to potentially make this my new favourite movie, unfortunately the script and narrative (if they originally  had one at all) failed to deliver.My main problem was the narrative. The story takes place over a few decades and follows the efforts of Fawcett to discover the ""Lost City of Z"". He embarks on 3 ""perilous"" expeditions going up the Amazon but no sense of danger or suffering is at any point conveyed by the narrative. The 3 trips are each expedited under 20 minutes of screen time. We have absolutely no idea of the time involved (apparently the expeditions lasted a few years each) nor any feeling towards the hardships the crew faces. To make matters worse, new crew members keep appearing out of nowhere and at some point even a horse!! which was nowhere to be seen on the raft in previous scenes. If this was not enough.... the raft keeps going downstream when they are supposed to go UPSTREAM, towards the source of the river.... oh well, I could have lived with these inconsistencies if I had a character to root for. Unfortunately we never feel any sympathy towards any of the protagonists. The character development is non existent and not helped by the fact the acting is very stiff at the best of time and downright awful for most of the movie. I didn't find Charlie Hunnam convincing as a Hell's Angel in SOA but he is seriously laughable as an English Army officer. This absence of feeling and empathy is also to be experienced towards the wife and children he leaves behind, every time he embarks on one of those trips. We simply do not care for them.I obviously did not go into it expecting a new Fitzcarraldo or Apocalypse Now but for a movie which should have dealt with a man's obsessive doomed quest for a Lost City, the jungle and/or the river should have been part and parcel of the movie, a character in itself, an omnipresent entity. No such thing. The whole movie could have been shot in a winter garden for all I saw... You never have the feeling you are in the mud with the protagonists. The only feeling you experience is one of utter detachment and an urge for the movie to finish as soon as possible. Extremely disappointed. Do not believe the hype!",The Lost City of Z
254,wiln-55662,Disappointing movie despite exciting cast,3,30 March 2017,"After watching the trailer for the lost city of z i was excited to see the film. The cast was promising and i'm a huge fan of historical exploration films and unashamedly the Indiana jones franchise. Having recently watched Master and Commander i thought this could be of a similar calibre. Unfortunately the script was dire and the acting was so awkward and cringeworthy i thought of leaving the cinema (which i've never done) there were times where the film felt like a satire, the main character played by charlie hunnam was paper thin and had no believable or relateable character traits that made you care about his struggle. The plot was pieced together and i cant recall a single scene which felt gritty or believing, as you would hope an amazon rainforest set epic would be. Instead we saw a single dimensional poor acting display from almost the whole cast, with Tom Holland (protagonist son and upcoming actor of the new spider-man) breathing a slight breath of life into the film with a more believable and rounded character. The attempt at having a strong female character was a good idea but it was poorly done and not in sync with the usual characters submissive role, not seeming to care of her husband leaving her and their children in England. Overall possibly the worst film i've seen at the cinema, mainly because of my expectations being let down so drastically. I'd avoid this film and wait for it to be on TV or Online and watch on a rainy Sunday in August. I'd imagine if you went into this film with no expectations it could be enjoyable, but unfortunately a big disappointment from what could have been an enthralling period adventure.",The Lost City of Z

The incredible attention to the most minute detail is really amazing. For example, in a scene where Fawcett is being visited by his wife and children while he's in the hospital, the shot is from the opposite side of the bed from where his family is standing. In the scene I couldn't help but notice the white painted iron headboard, grimy from hands clasping it for the purpose of moving the bed around for many years. This small detail just really struck me as indicative of the why the film maker went about locking every scene down perfectly.As for the story, its' a fascinating tale and one I'd like to know more about. Sadly, the script was not up the job of informing me. The acting was good, but the pace of the dialogue was slow and at times very deliberate, to a fault.

258,triplesixphix,Very weak,1,23 April 2017,"**spoilers but not so important** Me and my friends were at the shopping mall where they have a cinema and we decided to watch some movie. So we saw the list of movies that this cinema offered. And we immediately saw a big Z in the movie title and we thought wow they brought a second part of World War Z this has to be thrilling and good. We bought our tickets and instantly after the first scene we were like o man this has nothing to do with zombies.(I know we were stupid for not asking or watching the trailer). I was like OK lets give it a try but the movie is so boring i was so happy when it finally finished this 2hrs seemed to me like eternity. The story is so lame a guy who is obsessed with the idea of finding an ancient city full of gold, culture and experience and the whole movie circles just around that idea and his behavior towards this idea(from lacking as a parent, to his greed for fame etc..) At the beginning I was like OK huh maybe there will be some good scenes at least they are in the Amazon some skulls, bloodthirsty cannibals, some ancient penalties, wild animals, traps, good looking Indian women only in pants i was expecting at least something of that and yea OK I got something from the list but so weak and lame that i couldn't believe it. First the cannibals were the most friendliest beings ever, from animals only a little snake, one panther that was not even 1% bloodthirsty and a few piranhas but if u don't follow the movie u wont be even able to recognize them, so if u looking forward to get thrilled and seat settled trust me its the opposite. Now just a short movie recap Percy the main role is a officer or general and has to do some exploring to design a map for the world and they traveled the first time to finish the map the second time to find the city which they don't because of some illogical things like leaving one man behind and give him more food then they all have together left for the trip then he goes randomly into WW1 which makes absolutely no sense there is no single parallel(maybe just to show how egocentrically Percy is with his greed to be appreciated in society) to the movie title and story so it's practically 30min waste of time. And then after war ended his children grew up his oldest son wants to travel for a last time with him to finally find the city and nothing special happens the closing scenes are so sucked off and then after the last scene I felt a big relief like could it be true the movie is over I made it and I learned a lesson I will never ever go watch randomly a movie cos now the only one who is happy are these producers who took our money for zero entertainment.

I didn't get bored for an instant and I thought that all the actors and actresses did a great job of acting, and spent less time thinking of how they looked for publicity, which made the story more believable. I was totally convinced. Amazon did a great job of depicting a man who loves his wife and children for years at a time who otherwise basically thought of no one but himself. Fawcett went so far as to create children whom he then left to the other 50% to take care of, and to blame a man who was almost losing his life for ruining his expedition instead of worrying about making sure the man was OK above all.

265,cathalgodonovan,A delightful story of personal exploration,10,2 September 2017,"This movie took me on a personal journey. The central character's disillusionment with privileged western society is beautifully captured in his fervor for new horizons. The reluctance he initially experiences as he is presented with his quest and until he finds his passion echoes a real journey through life.The mystery of his ending finishes the story with bitter-sweetness. This is matched only by the shocking realisation that the story is based on truth. I loved this Iliad of love for the planet, it's people, and for ourselves as reflections of the universe. It is a clear untainted lens in the directors camera that also captures the behaviors and attitudes of ignorance and wanton selfishness.I like that it made no attempt to comment or intellectualise on societal and cultural differences between the advanced and 'primitive' peoples and nations of the world, reversing perceptions and championing the pioneering spirit of adventure and exploration as the real reward that grows within those who accept their hero's journey.I thought that the central character was played well as a quietly spoken but passionate gentleman of self-awareness, integrity and single-minded stubbornness as he is unwavering in facing the mediocre distraction of the mob.In his attempts to tenuously balance his love for his family, he perhaps fails as the mere human that he is. That fluctuating and flawed tension between his fervent passion and deep compassion gave the story an eternal energy, and is, I believe a universal experience of the pioneering spirit.Refreshingly low-budget, with lesser-known actors and without the pomposity of block-buster inanity, this is a small personal story that says much about the human heart and spirit. It is a great show and a must for those who thirst for adventure and new horizons.",The Lost City of Z

The practicalities of the story didn't make sense (they floated down a river to find the source of it, etc.) The ending was bizarrely made up with no explanation of the legacy left behind or discoveries since made.But it's worse than that.The problem is that this movie will ruin every viewers' perception of an incredible and important true story.

I wanted so badly to find this film satisfying, but it truly falls short in the end. If you want to experience the disappointment of the characters themselves, without any true sense of fulfilled purpose, the writing accomplishes this marvelously. If you want to feel, at the end of a movie, like to was worth all the investment of your hopes and emotions that's were so expertly developed throughout this otherwise well-made film, skip it. I'm not sure how to better make a film about not fulfilling your passions, but this felt like slow death in the last act, with a lot of unclear messaging. Percy's half-developed lines in the end about ""nothing will happen to us that is not our destiny"" are not convincing nor consistent with the lifelong struggle of a man against all odds to pursue that which truly seems out of reach (and who we think will succeed against expectations). The story is set up to be a ""triumph against the odds"" tale, as currently written, and of course ends in failure and no satisfaction for the audience after rooting for our hero. It's like a movie in which Superman slowly dies of high cholesterol all the while talking about getting better. And then he actually dies...no sequel. The closest thing to a believable message by the end of the movie (as confusingly stated and unclear as it sounds) is: ""Push hard against the odds and make every necessary sacrifice for that which you believe in, and in the end, no one will know if you ever succeeded...even you. Odds are, you probably won't succeed. But somehow it's worth it...maybe...but we don't really know."" Except I'm pretty sure that's not what the writers were actually going for, so...flop. Spoiler alert: he doesn't find the lost city and maybe (?) dies at the hands of natives who actually exemplify the very stereotype of ignorance Percy fought so hard to dismantle throughout the movie...Either that or he decided to never again communicate with or return to the family he is portrayed to have so deeply loved and to instead stay in the jungle forever eluding search parties (not likely)...Except I'm pretty sure that's ALSO not what the writers were going for. Really disappointing writing and poor waste of otherwise phenomenal filmmaking. Sorry I spent the time.",The Lost City of Z
