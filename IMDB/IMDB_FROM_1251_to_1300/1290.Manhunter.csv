0,TheLittleSongbird,Very arresting,9,7 June 2015,"There's always going to be inevitable comparisons between Manhunter and Silence of the Lambs. To keep comparisons brief, to me Silence of the Lambs is the superior film, but Manhunter is almost as good and a great film in its own right.It's very stylishly made, with use of colour and lighting that is beautiful and gritty and photography that is both luminous and unnerving, while Michael Mann's directing is top-notch and some of his tightest ever. A clever and incredibly thought-provoking script helps as does the strong characterisation(Dollarhyde is particularly well realised here). The story, which does a credible job compressing an in some ways unfilmable book in two hours(even if you wish there was more detail sometimes), in Manhunter is very arresting, with a particularly suspenseful first half and an atmosphere that gives one chills. It begins grippingly, setting up what's to follow very well indeed, and ends excitingly if slightly anti-climatically. Pacing is deliberate but never dull.When it comes to individual scenes, three really stood out, both as three of the best of all the Lecter films and also as an example of how great a director Mann is. One is the Tooth Fairy Letter analysis, two is the Dollarhyde and Rena encounter and three is Graham's nail-bitingly dream-like visit to Lecter. Nothing to complain about the acting, coming off particularly strongly is Tom Noonan who is truly frightening as Dollarhyde while also giving room for pity. Brian Cox's Lecter is very different to the more iconic performance of Anthony Hopkins, it's more ambiguous and more understated but no less creepy or entertaining(in fact because Cox acts like a killer-acting-completely-normal-to-the-outside-world it's somewhat more realistic and unsuspecting). It may not be as well known a performance but it's a great one in its own way and shouldn't be overlooked just because of it being different. William Petersen's lead performance is fine too, at times appropriately haunting.My only complaint actually is the music, a couple of the song choices come off well and fit, especially In a Gadda Da Vida, but most of them come over as cheesy and misplaced, Heartbeat being the biggest offender. The electronic score is also at times too intrusive, often really doesn't fit the tone of the film at all and has a really dated sound to it, even for a film made in the 80s. Overall though, Manhunter is great, arresting stuff and not to be missed. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Manhunter
1,Leofwine_draca,Stylish serial killing greatness,8,21 August 2016,"Although THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is the film that everyone remembers for Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of the cannibal Dr. Hannibal Lector, I find that in most cases the general public don't realise that Hopkins was not the first actor to play Lector. No, that dubious honour goes to Brian Cox, whose brief but powerful turn as Lector in MANHUNTER is just one of the film's many highlights. I didn't really know what to expect when I watched this film; I'd heard that it was good, but little did I realise just HOW good it was. MANHUNTER is one of the very best films about a serial killer I've seen; this is an intelligent, exciting and thought-provoking story which I actually preferred to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS in some respects.This is a disturbing film too, although without the grossness of the film that followed it. Here, the violence is left to the imagination, which makes it all the more effective. Usually the police investigations in these films are dry and boring, but here, as the characters doing the investigating are very human, it becomes interesting and watchable. The cast is first rate; especially good is Peterson as the slightly disturbed FBI man haunted by his previous encounters with Cox. He is equalled by the underrated Tom Noonan, who is simply brilliant as the killer, Francis Dollarhyde. Noonan would forever be typecast as a baddie after this performance, but his work here is excellent as he creates a childish, sympathetic man who cannot control the urges or what he does.The strong supporting cast includes Joan Allen (very good) as a blind victim; Dennis Farina as a fellow cop (wait, doesn't he always play that role?), and Stephen Lang as a nerdy reporter who meets a fate worse than death. Michael Mann's assured direction keeps the film believable and interesting at all times; MANHUNTER is exciting when it needs to be and very disturbing at other times (especially that scene with Dollarhyde with the stocking over his head... an image guaranteed to give you nightmares). Odd scenes like the burning wheelchair victim are unexpected and help to keep you on your toes. A rare film that doesn't underestimate the intelligence of the audience, MANHUNTER is a perfectly-made film that should be rewatched in the days of populist stuff like SEVEN and THE BONE COLLECTOR just to remember how good it is.",Manhunter
2,SnoopyStyle,stylized Michael Mann thriller,8,29 March 2015,Will Graham (William Petersen) and his wife Molly (Kim Greist) are retired in Florida with their son after getting worn out by his FBI profiling job. His former boss Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina) asks him to return for one more job. The serial killer 'Tooth Fairy' kills entire families in their homes during the full moon. He decides to consult with serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecktor (Brian Cox) whom he put away years ago resulting in his retirement. Lecktor manages to steal Will's home address using Dr. Sidney Bloom (Paul Perri)'s office. Dr. Frederick Chilton (Benjamin Hendrickson) discovers that Lecktor is in contact with the Tooth Fairy. Will uses muck-raking reporter Freddy Lounds (Stephen Lang) to write an unflattering article about the Tooth Fairy who turns out to be Francis Dollarhyde (Tom Noonan). He takes revenge on Freddy and then he falls for blind photographic expert Reba McClane (Joan Allen).It's fascinating that the serial killer isn't in the movie until late in the first hour. This is more about the procedural. It's not a whodunnit mystery. It's also a chess game between Will and Hannibal Lecktor. This was before CSI in 2000 or 'The Silence of the Lambs' in 1991. This was the mid-80s and it was probably the first time I've ever heard of the term profiler. The detailed forensics are more compelling than ever before. Michael Mann has made a stylized movie probably influenced by TV show Miami Vice. He uses colors to accentuate moods. It's got a specific look. William Petersen is great as Will and basically reprises a similar role in CSI. Brian Cox is functional as Hannibal Lecktor but nobody is ever going to touch Anthony Hopkins.,Manhunter
3,Horst_In_Translation,"Major flaws in this one, but still entertaining enough",6,20 May 2017,"""Manhunter"" is an American crime thriller from 1986, so this one had its 30th anniversary last year. The director is Oscar nominee Michael Mann and he is also the one who adapted Thomas Harris' ""Red Dragon"" for the screen here. And if you hear that title, you maybe already realize that this film takes place in the universe of Hannibal Lecter. Actually, it is the very first film about this subject, even if not too many remember it anymore, at least not compared to the follow-up(s). This certainly also has to do with all the critics praise and awards recognition for ""Silence of the Lambs"" that came out five years later roughly. But this one here also features a solid cast including William Petersen for lead actor, who is very much known for ""CSI"" today, or Joan Allen, who has several Oscar nominations, or Stephen Lang from ""Avatar"" (almost unrecognizable with all the hair) or the late Dennis Farina and Americans will perhaps recognize some other names too. This is a relatively long movie at slightly under two hours and this film frequently looks like a typical one-man badass routine movie from the 1980s filled with macho moments and stuff like that. Not sure though if Petersen was the right choice from that perspective. I mean he's not totally off, but also he's certainly no Charles Bronson and his screaming into the open as if his enemy was there also felt a little pathetic at times. In general, how he talks to the villain in the latter's absence just felt all kinds of wrong and the explanation that a previous case did something to him psychologically is not good enough to justify all that.Story-wise, the film could have been better, could have been worse. The moments in which the main character comes closer to solving the case, especially when he fully solves it by becoming aware of the killer's area of profession, feel pretty scripted honestly and not in a way that you could say they happen in real life too. The Lecter moments with the criminal mastermind in his cell were probably still among the better (despite some strange acting/writing from/to Petersen's character, especially when he storms outside), but the general crime story did not work out too well I must say. This is a bit disappointing as the main antagonist had solid moments when he was actually getting screen time, a lot on one occasion even like two thirds into the film, especially with his physical presence. But he does not even come close to getting enough screen time to turn this into a great film. Otherwise, he could have been the saving grace as the character was written in an interesting manner. I was not 100% sure if the blind woman really wanted him, but I guess they indeed had sex and it was not just in his mind. So he was really insecure afterwards and jealous and mistakes a random moment of closeness between her and her boss for something else that really makes him lose his cool. But I am writing almost more here than you see from the killer. Instead, it is all about Petersen's character, but he is no Jodie Foster either. I am a bit surprised to see the strong reviews, high ratings and a pretty positive reception for this one here as I found it a bit bland and uninspired on more than one occasion. The final shooting wasn't bad, there is so much mediocrity before that unfortunately that I am not sure it's worth waiting for . Maybe it is worth checking out for the very biggest fans of everything Lecter-related, but everybody else can indeed skip it.Mann is a filmmaker of whom I have not seen too much yet, want to though, but I must admit this film here did not get me highly curious about his body of work. Still, I should not judge him, even if from what I have seen, this could be my least favorite effort from the Oscar-nominated director. It was also a bit of a letdown from the atmospheric side. There were locations in this movie that could have been more memorable with better precision and attention to detail. Still give it a go, especially if you like Petersen. I am always a bit undecided on him, his big screaming moment admittedly also felt a bit ham. But I have just not seen enough from this actually really prolific actor to make a final statement. His character's know-it-all personality, not just here, but also on CSI for example where he plays the exact same dude with more focus on science and less focus on police work, does not feel positive to me at all (although I should not mistake unlikable for unrealistic, but still these characters are so full of stereotypes...) and I don't remember if I have seen him in anything else. Also this movie here takes itself way more seriously than it should with the alpha male troubled genius character at the center of it all. One thing, even if it is somewhat linked to that too (looking at who the singers are), that I liked was the music. Not the score I mean (although the score is alright too), but the soundtrack, some really catchy tunes in here that we listen to and almost make it easy to forget about scenes like the ending when Petersen's character after jumping through the glass and being knocked to the ground by the bad guy still manages to gun him down after the bad guy takes out two or three other cops. But he does not take out super cop. Of course, Petersen's character must be the one to end it all and save the helpless blind girl before she has her head cut off. Oh, but that is not the very end. It does get worse. The scene with the turtles at the beach and the question linked to survival and the answer that most of them made it was so cringeworthy honestly. Like the humble hero there doing great on the family front too and this metaphor about all the humans outside living with the bad guy being dead now felt utterly clumsy. So yeah, there is this conflict with the main character's family and he goes out to catch the bad guy and the danger is not that he is getting killed, but that he loses his sanity once again or even further. Honestly all the scenes with the woman and son are not good, some even pretty bad like the question he has answered for himself already pretty early on. What a desirable male! Sure knows what he wants. And even can make the pink panties work haha in the last shot. So 80s.Thinking of it, there are indeed many pathetic aspects here in terms of the writing and also some that may not be pathetic, but still weak like the obviously innocent jogger. He could have sued for racism now in the 21st century. Luckily, it was mostly the supporting cast who kept this thing going and watchable. Not just Noonan, who plays the bad guy really well also with his voice, but also Farina, Lang, Cox and a few others. Maybe Allen too, but Mann (fittingly with the name) has always been more about the males in his films. The funniest moment was probably from Farina's character when he laughs in an awkward manner when there is talk about the possibility that the killer could have had a sexual relationship with his mother back when he was a child. And his face expression right after this laughing moment. Petersen is all about business, all about saving his family when they could potentially be targeted by the bad guy and not one bit about comedy. True professional and no time for jokes. Again not sure he is the right actor for this. The only moment with him when I smiled a bit after he said something was when he mentioned that it was Lecktor's (unusual spelling!) insanity that gave him a massive disadvantage back then. But yeah with the Lecktor character here and what he does and how he does it, you could already see that this one had huge potential for his own movie and this was when Foster and Hopkins came into play half a decade later. The phone scene is telling enough, even if it was a little too fast for my taste to understand all that was really going on there and showed us what a mastermind he was. Not just the gum paper.Now as for this one here, it is a truly close call for me, but I will be generous and give out the positive recommendation, even if it is by no means a must-see and I wish they could have gone more for subtlety on many occasions here. But the opposite is the case, especially with how Petersen's character is depicted throughout (please don't tell me he could win a fight man vs. man against Stephen Lang like when he knocks him onto the car! oh well, maybe back then). Just far too exaggerated. Also, despite the SotL connection (and let's keep in mind that the original franchise ended a long time ago and Mikkelsen's take on the character is also not new and fresh anymore), I was pretty surprised how many people were in the audience last night. Despite the virus. Maybe this film is indeed not going under the radar anymore. Oh yes, how they decrypted the code with these (not) Bible references was also extremely absurd. In-between, I honestly felt that there could just be a very different ending. He falls for the blind girl, maybe she falls for him, and with another gigantic maybe they live happily ever after and he never kills again and Petersen's character returns back to his home in the sun after nothing happens the questionable night where John Doe was supposed to kill again (they really should have done more with the full moon reference from the very start, that one was gone completely...) and also lives there happily ever after, but I guess this was no option with alpha male cop in charge here. Pity, it maybe would have been the better and more authentic route. Now, really enough. Go see this one and, if you want, also come up with a review afterwards. Unless you haven't seen the way superior ""Silence of the Lambs"". Then go for that one instead. Or just pick both.",Manhunter
4,claudio_carvalho,Engaging Thriller that Has not Aged,8,28 October 2014,"In Florida, the retired FBI agent Will Graham (William Petersen) is visited by his former chief and friend Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina). Graham lives with his wife Molly (Kim Greist) and their son Kevin in a seaside house and was retired after capturing the notorious Dr. Hannibal Lecktor (Brian Cox) that affected him and left Graham disturbed. Jack needs Graham to help him to trace the profile of the Tooth Fairy serial- killer that attacks in the full moon and has killed Mmes. Jacobi in Birmingham and Valerie Leeds in Atlanta and their families. Graham discusses with Molly and accepts the assignment, and he immediately visits the crime scenes and the dangerous Dr. Lecktor in prison to seek help to find the motives. Then Graham asks Jack to send his efficient agent Jimmy Price (Dan E. Butler) to Atlanta to seek fingerprints in the bodies of the members of the Leeds family. Soon they learn that the Tooth Fairy has contacted Dr. Lecktor that gave Graham's address to the serial-killer. Will Graham succeed in stopping the killer before the next full moon?""Manhunter"" is an engaging thriller by Michael Mann based on the novel of Thomas Harris that has become famous years later with the movie by Anthony Hopkins. I saw ""Manhunter"" many times, the last one on 30 April 2003, and this thriller has not aged. Yesterday I saw again now on a shameful DVD released by Universal-Studio Canal with the most ridiculous subtitles in Portuguese that makes impossible to understand many parts if the viewer does not understand English.""Manhunter"" has top-notch performances with great development of characters and outstanding music score. Brian Cox is a scary Dr. Hannibal Lecktor. The climax with Iron Butterfly's ""In-a-Gadda-da-Vida"" is frantic and scary to see the blind character of Joan Allen in the middle of the chaos. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Dragão Vermelho"" (""Red Dragon"")",Manhunter
5,gavin6942,Awesome Police Procedural,8,5 June 2015,"Former FBI profiler Will Graham (William Petersen) returns to service to pursue a deranged serial murderer named ""the Tooth Fairy"" (Tom Noonan) by the media.This film, which I last saw on VHS (probably around 2002) is not as ""Miami Vice"" as I recalled. Sure, it is still Michael Mann in the 1980s and you have some bright colors and beaches, but that is relatively minor. What you have more than anything is a really smart police procedural with a detective tracking a killer and trying to get inside his head.We also have the advantage of knowing the killer from the start, so we get to follow him as well, and see how he reacts to his budding romance with a blind woman. For a man so hideous and doing such hideous things, she may be the perfect companion.",Manhunter
6,jboothmillard,Manhunter,7,19 June 2008,"I saw Brett Ratner's remake based on the novel of the same name, Red Dragon, and with most remakes, this original version is much better, from director Michael Mann (Collateral). 5 years before Sir Anthony Hopkin's Oscar winning turn in The Silence of the Lambs, plus 2001's sequel Hannibal and the prequel remake I mentioned (both also starring Hopkins) came Brian Cox, best known The Bourne Trilogy, and even though he doesn't have the same great delivery of lines or pure evil look, he's still more memorable than most other characters. Anyway, basically a sophisticated serial killer is on the loose, and ex-detective Will Graham (William Petersen) is brought out of retirement to help hunt him down. The only person who may have some idea of how he thinks and where he might go is the man Graham caught and caused his retirement, Dr. Hannibal Lecktor (Cox), who without anyone's knowledge manages to use his phone time, fiddle with the wires and tell this serial killer anything that helps. This killer by the way we do eventually see is Francis Dollarhyde (Tom Noonan), a sadistic man most of the time wearing a balaclava on his head, quoting from the bible, and (briefly seen) hanging out with a blind girl. Also starring Kim Greist as Molly Graham, Dennis Farina as Jack Crawford, Stephen Lang as Freddie Lounds, The Bourne Trilogy's Joan Allen as Reba McClane, David Seaman as Kevin Graham and Benjamin Hendrickson as Dr. Frederick Chilton. Like Cox, Noonan is also not as convincing as Ralph Fiennes (with Hopkins, the only good reason to see the remake), but like I said, there is enough mystery and suspense scattered, and good performances to keep you interested. It was number 41 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die. Very good!",Manhunter
7,ccthemovieman-1,'Hannibal' Before He Became Famous,6,14 October 2006,"This was the first look at Hannibal Lechter, but it really didn't have the impact of ""Silence Of The Lambs"" and the two subsequent movies also dealing with Lechter. Those - ""Hannibal"" and ""Red Dragon"" (a re-make of this movie) - all had Anthony Hopkins as the famous criminal. Hopkins ""take"" on the character was so memorable, so riveting that he made it his own. In this movie, Lechter is not memorable. Few people could tell you who played him in this film. The answer: Brian Cox.That's not to say it's a bad film. It isn't, but it's no great shakes, either. The first half is very suspenseful but the second half of the movie is disappointing. It is interesting to look back now and see a young Bill Peterson in the lead. I am used to seeing the CSI television star as a more mature ""Gil Grissom.""I watched this movie back in the '80s before I knew Petersen, Cox, Hopkins and the rest.....and it was better. Sorry to say, the other films have simply eclipsed this effort.",Manhunter
8,rmax304823,Tidy FBI vs. Serial Killer Story.,6,15 February 2009,"William Peterson is a traumatized FBI agent drawn back to duty by his colleague, Dennis Farina, to track down a serial killer, named ""the tooth fairy"" for his habit of removing his victims' teeth, played by William Noonan. Brian Cox is Hannibal Lecktor, who remains safely locked away and plays a minor part in the hunt. Joan Allen is a blind woman taken captive by Noonan and saved from slashing at the last moment.It precedes ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" by the same author, William Harris, but is independent and not quite so commercial. I GUESS it wasn't as commercial anyway, since it didn't receive nearly the media attention that ""Silence of the Lambs"" did.I'm not sure why. Maybe because it didn't have Jody Foster in the lead, and lacked Anthony Hopkins' touches as Horrible Hannibal. But William Noonan brings his own kind of menace to the role of the tooth fairy. Noonan is a strange-looking guy. The character is supposed to be seven feet tall and he's shot in such a way as to make the claim convincing. He's balding and dolichocephalic and always speaks in a direct, matter-of-fact mid-American voice. He's far more ambiguous a character than Hopkins, to whom I'm comparing him because he and Hopkins are the chief villains in each film. Noonan can feel human emotions. He sensitive. He meets the blind photographer, Joan Allen, and is attracted to her, so he takes her to a veterinarian friend and lets her feel the fur and the fangs of a giant narcotized tiger. Well, that's quite a thrill for her, so she seduces him. Can you imagine Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector being seduced? It's only later, when Noonan comes to believe that Allen has betrayed him, that his cool rage emerges.Tightly directed, except for a couple of action-scene clichés that appear in slow motion. The image of a red dragon has cropped up now and again during the film, and when Noonan's bullet-riddled body is spread eagled on the floor, the blood spreads out from his torso like dragon wings. The photography is uninviting -- not that it's inappropriate -- with all the lights apparently being fluorescent. Or, if they happen to be blue or pink, they seem to be coming from neon signs. It's summer but the entire film seems to be filled with chill.There are some gruesome scenes that might disturb some people, though maybe not much more exuberantly horrifying than some of those in ""Silence of the Lambs."" Okay, so there's a man strapped in a wheel chair, set on fire, and rolled down the ramp of a parking lot into the camera with flame streaming behind him. True, it's worse than what my dentist does to me, but it's no more shocking than what Richard Widmark did with a wheelchair in ""Kiss of Death.""",Manhunter
9,Tweekums,A gripping thriller,9,8 September 2017,"A killer, dubbed the 'Tooth Fairy' by the police has murdered two apparently unconnected families; one on Atlanta, the other in Birmingham, Alabama. He strikes each month on the night of the full moon so the race is on to catch him. With no other leads the FBI call in Will Graham, a former profiler, who retired after a particularly traumatic, high-profile case. In order to get his mind back in the game he goes to visit Dr Hannibal Lecktor, the infamous killer he put behind bars. This meeting gets reported in the gutter press and ultimately puts his family in danger. As he reviews the crime scenes Will starts to get into the head of the killer; working out how he operates and ultimately how he selects the families he intends to kill.This is a gripping thriller with Nietzschean undertones. Will Graham is an interesting central character; a man who as looked into the abyss before and felt it looking back and now he is being asked to do it again. We don't see the killer until a scene where he is clearly identified; this isn't about the viewer figuring out who did it ahead of the detective it is about seeing how the detective closes in on the killer. Director Michael Mann keeps everything very stylish; not surprising that he'd previously given us the TV series 'Miami Vice'; the epitome of '80s cool. William Petersen does a really fine job as Will Graham; an interesting character with a history. Brian Cox may only have a small part as Dr Lecktor but he manages to be menacing in a subtle manner. Tom Noonan is suitably menacing as the killer, especially in the scenes where he takes a blind colleague on a date and later gets jealous when he sees her talking to another man. The supporting cast is pretty solid too. Given the subject matter there could be plenty of disturbing content; thankfully it is more restrained and apart from a brief shot of crime scene photographs and blood stains in a house there is little in the way of disturbing material; it is described but not shown. Overall this is a really solid thriller that I'd certainly recommend.",Manhunter

11,BA_Harrison,Better than Silence Of The Lambs.,8,20 June 2020,"Five years before Anthony Hopkins' iconic portrayal of Hannibal Lecter in Silence Of The Lambs (1991), director Michael Mann introduced film-goers to the infamous cannibal in Manhunter (albeit with the slightly different spelling of his name as Lecktor). Played by Brian Cox, Mann's Hannibal isn't the central villain in Manhunter -- that would be sick serial killer Francis Dollarhyde (Tom Noonan) -- but he does play a pivotal role in FBI profiler Will Graham's hunt for the killer, who has been busy slaughtering and mutilating entire families. As Graham (William Petersen) gets closer to his quarry, putting himself in the mind of the killer, he risks not only his sanity but his life.Coming from the man who gave us ultra-stylish '80s TV series Miami Vice, Manhunter is a great looking film, Mann as focussed on image as he is narrative: there's plenty of beautifully framed architecture, cool night-scapes and stylish interior decor. The director's clinical approach -- every shot carefully composed, every camera movement meticulously planned -- gives the film a precision that complements Graham's work ethic: no detail is too trivial.Unlike Silence Of The Lambs, which suffered from a plot that took some swallowing at times, Mann's movie is a slick, streamlined thriller that runs from A to B without a hitch. It might seem a little sterile at times, with its stark imagery and seemingly emotionless synth soundtrack, but one cannot deny the mastery of the storytelling and the strength of the performances (Noonan is excellent as the psycho, and Cox lays down much of the groundwork for Hopkins' future performance).Mann skilfully builds things to a tense climax in which Graham finally locates Dollarhyde as he is about to kill photo-lab technician Reba McClane (Joan Allen), who, being blind, has been unable to ascertain what a weirdo she has been dating. The use of Iron Butterfly's classic rock song In A Gadda Da Vida (baby) during the final showdown is the clincher, making Manhunter better than Silence of the Lambs (at least in my humble opinion).",Manhunter
12,paul_haakonsen,Quite boring...,4,31 December 2015,"I was lured in by the Hannibal Lecktor (yes, it is spelled that way in this 1986 movie) and wasn't familiar with this movie prior to finding it by sheer random luck in the local secondhand DVD store for $2. So I bought it and gave it a go......and I wasn't particularly entertained or thrilled.It was the story that failed to impress or captivate me. And not even the impressive cast could manage to salvage the sinking storyline. And it should be pointed out that the cast was fantastic with talents such as William Petersen, Brian Cox, Dennis Farina, Tom Noonan and Stephen Lang. As good an actor as Brian Cox is, he just didn't cut it as Hannibal.I quickly lost interest in the movie as the story never caught my interest and it was only half-hearted that I made it through the two hours that the movie dragged on for.I am sure that this movie will appeal greatly to the hardcore fans of the Hannibal legacy. But for a casual viewer this was a less than mediocre movie experience.",Manhunter
13,wes-connors,The Roar of the Red Dragon,8,9 January 2015,"In Florida, retired crime scene investigator William Petersen (as Will Graham) is approached by former co-worker Dennis Farina (as Jack Crawford) about returning to work. He's recovered, but Mr. Peterson had to quit after a mental breakdown; for good reason, he survived a confrontation with notorious serial killer ""Hannibal Lecktor"" (Brian Cox). Yes, it's the same one who eats people and was famously portrayed by Anthony Hopkins. Lecktor is in prison and a new serial killer, called ""The Tooth Fairy"" (Tom Noonan), is on the loose. This one slaughters entire families every month, during the full moon. Peterson takes the case and, to get into the killer's mind, he seeks advice from Lecktor. This is helpful to Peterson, but Lecktor is also communicating with the new killer...""Manhunter"" was adapted, by director Michael Mann, from Thomas Harris' novel ""Red Dragon"". The most famous of the author's books is ""The Silence of the Lambs"", which won a truckload of awards for its 1991 film version. This movie was a relative failure, but it's excellent. His screenplay holds back when it could condense more information from the novel; however, Mr. Mann directs with imagination and flair. The cinematography, by Dante Spinotti, is a great asset. The aforementioned cast members are nicely supported by blind love interest Joan Allen (as Reba McClane), fiery-haired tabloid reporter Stephen Lang (as Freddy Lounds), and worried wife Kim Greist (as Molly). Although you can often catch Mann trying his damnedest to be cutting edge, he succeeds.******** Manhunter (8/15/86) Michael Mann ~ William Petersen, Dennis Farina, Tom Noonan, Joan Allen",Manhunter
14,BandSAboutMovies,A perfect movie,10,7 January 2018,"Sure, Silence of the Lambs is a great movie. But you're reading my words right now, so I want you to know that Manhunter is a way better movie. In fact, it's nearly a perfect film, one whose perfect union of light, color, tone and sound nearly moves me to tears.Dino De Laurentiis was involved in this, changing the title from Red Dragon, and being his usual hamfisted self, but Michael Mann was coming in hot from TV's Miami Vice (he'd previously directed Thief and The Keep before that show caught fire).William Petersen (who would go on to star in CSI) is phenomenal as Will Graham, a former FBI profiler who has to come out of retirement to help solve a murder. Working on his character with the Chicago and FBI Violent Crimes Units, he learned that profilers often had to compartmentalize their personal lives, because it was near impossible to turn off the things they'd seen. In fact, at the conclusion of the film, Petersen found it near impossible to shake the character.Tom Noonan (Frankenstein's Monster in The Monster Squad) researched serial killers, but found himself sickened by what he learned. Instead, he tried to become a man who saw that he was doing good for his victims instead of harming them. He was doing it out of love. Improvising during his audition, he noticed that he was frightening one of the casting agents, so he pushed hard to frighten her even more. He claims that this is what secured the role for him. But the real star of the show is Michael Mann's eye and his work with director of photography Dante Spinotti. There are color tints throughout the film, ala Bava, with cool blue representing love and green with purple and magenta to denote the violent moments. Petersen has said that Mann wanted a visual aura for the film, so the story could work on an emotional level.Even the framing of the shots - watch how close Petersen is with other characters in the film, particularly how Dennis Farina (whose acting career began in Mann's Thief) nearly collapses before coming near him at the end of the film, where once they could sit side by side.Let's get into the story: Will Graham (Petersen) is a retired FBI profiler who had a mental breakdown after being attacked by the serial killer Dr. Hannical Lecktor (yes, that's the correct spelling and Brian Cox (Zodiac) is commanding in this role). His old boss Jack Crawford (Farina) needs him to come back and enter the mind of the Tooth Fairy (Noonan), a killer who preys on families. Graham and Crawford both promise his family - Molly (Kim Greist, C.H.U.D.) and Kevin - that he will only look at the evidence and not get involved.What follows is a cat and mouse game of trying to find the Tooth Fairy while Graham must return to confront the man who nearly cost him his life and sanity, Dr. Lecktor. Everything the police try backfires, including using a tabloid journalist to draw out the killer, which puts Graham's family in direct danger when Lecktor gives the killer their home address.There's a great scene here where Graham and his son shop. In what would be a throw away scene in any other film, the true humanity of Mann's work, in contrast to his meticulous editing and color theory, shine through. You can tell that Kevin has been forced to grow up and become the man of the house while his father was destroyed by Lecktor. And now, his father has to prove that he can protect his family again.Meanwhile, the Tooth Fairy has found love with Reba (Joan Allen, Room), a blind co-worker. She cannot see his hairlip. She isn't aware that he's watching his victims while they enjoy a romantic dinner. His love for her and her acceptance has suppressed his bloodlust. Yet just as Graham's profile discovers just how important that acceptance is, he sees her go home with another employee. It's simply a ride home, but the killer goes wild, killing the man and abducting Reba. She calls him by his name and he replies, ""Frances is gone. Forever.""What follows is my favorite scene in the film, where we visually see how Graham's mind works, as he figures out the connection between the murders where families were killed and their eyes replaced with mirrors. He figures out that all of the films came from the same lab. As he looks out the window, sure that he is right and ready to be confirmed, even when the lab says they have different labels, he confidently looks out the window and asks them to peel the label back. His hand against the window, the moon bright, he is proved correct and the chase is on.As they determine the Tooth Fairy's identity on the plane, leaving police cars barely enough time to meet them as they land, you know that Graham will not wait for backup. He is back, in his element, no longer a beaten man. As they make their way to the Kansas City riverfront (a bravurra scene with a house that was made just for the film), Graham and Crawford race through the woods as teh Tooth Fairy begins shotgunning cops.During the final encounter, Mann shot multiple speeds, so that cameras were recording the same scene at 24, 36, 72 and 90 frames per second. This gives the shootout a feel that Spinotti said was off tempo and staccato. I found it disconcerting, the violence, not Hollywood glamour but messy real life.Even more intriguing is that the climax was shot after principal photography and when the union crew had run out of hours. There wasn't even an effects crew on hand, so the skeleton crew that remained blew ketchup across the set through hoses to simulate blood spray. The home of the Tooth Fairy is an otherworldly place, blasting Iron Butterfly's ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Via,"" lunar landscapes blocking rooms, before Graham busts through the window, breaking the Tooth Fairy's carefully created world. Despite this act of heroism, the killer simply drops him to the floor and continues killing cops. yet Graham rises and defeats the man and confronts his victim. When he asks him who he is, he replies, ""Graham. Will Graham."" He has left the other demons in his mind behind. He is himself again, ready to leave this world behind and return to his family.So how is this film a giallo? Simple. Where it has no connection to the fashion and female protagonist that are hallmarks of the genre, the color choices, driven hero and psychosexual motives of the killer are pure giallo. So is the devotion to symetry in the shots, echoing the work of Argento. However, this is a film stripped of the camp that is at the heart of so much giallo. Yet there it is, inside the DNA of this film.",Manhunter
15,michaelRokeefe,A serial killer is asked to help find another.,6,3 March 2001,"This is the first in the Dr. Hannibal Lecter trilogy. William Peterson is a Special Agent with the FBI and is called on to help track and find a serial killer before he strikes again. The manhunter pays a visit to another killer, Hannibal Lecter(Brian Cox), whom he helped put in prison. Talking to Dr. Lecter just might give some insight in tracking down the current stalker/killer on the loose.Awesome camera work and chilling use of soundtrack featuring Iron Butterfly and Red 7. Frightening, thrilling and tension filled film. Director Michael Mann teams well with Thomas Harris, who based the screenplay on his novel ""Red Dragon"".Peterson's character is fearless, yet laid back. Cox is creepy in his short scene as Lecter. Tom Noonan plays the lumbering, but volatile villain. Dennis Farina and Joan Allen also appear.",Manhunter
16,sunwarrior13,The Movie That Introduced Us To Hannibal,9,17 October 2011,"The legend of Hannibal The Cannibal started all in this film - Manhunter.It is an American thriller film based on Thomas Harris's novel Red Dragon. It was written and directed by Michael Mann.The movie stars William Petersen as Will Graham and features Brian Cox as Hannibal Lecktor (not Lecter).The story begins when FBI profiler Will Graham comes out of retirement to help investigate a killer known as ""The Tooth Fairy"".In doing so,he must confront the specter of his past and meet with a jailed killer,Dr.Lecktor,who nearly counted killed him and counted him amongst his victims. Dennis Farina co-stars as Jack Crawford, Graham's superior at the FBI, while serial killer Francis Dollarhyde,The Tooth Fairy,is portrayed by Tom Noonan.The movie was good but it does not hold a candle to the other great Hannibal movies like Red Dragon and Silence Of The Lambs.The acting were good and so was the screenplay but the movie lacked the tension and the suspense needed to keep the movie interesting.Comparing Manhunter and the Red Dragon,I have to place the latter as superior as compared to the former.Acting: Edward Norton was better as Will Graham as compared to William Petersen.Anthony Hopkins was better as Hannibal as compared to Brian Cox. Ralph Fiennes was better as Francis Dollarhyde as compared to Tom Noonan. Harvey Keitel was better as Jack Crawford as compared to Dennis Farina. Philip Seymour Hoffman was better as Freddy Lounds as compared to Stephen Lang. Emily Watson was better as Reba as compared to Joan Allen. Only Kim Greist from Manhunter was better as Molly Graham as compared to Mary Louise Parker. So for acting,Red Dragon was better compared to Manhunter. Direction: Michael Mann of Manhunter did a better job as compared to Brett Ratner of Red Dragon. Rating: Red Dragon is a 10/10 while Manhunter was a 9/10.",Manhunter
17,hitchcockthelegend,Recover the mindset.,10,17 June 2012,"Retired FBI specialist Will Graham is lured back into action to track a serial killer who is killing families, seemingly linked into the lunar cycle. In the process it opens up some old mental wounds that were born out during his last action out in the field...Before the gargantuan success of Silence of the Lambs, where the name Hannibal the Cannibal moved into pop culture, and before director Michael Mann became a named auteur often referenced with relish by hungry film students; there was Manhunter, Michael Mann's brilliant adaptation of Thomas Harris' equally brilliant psychological thriller, Red Dragon. It feels a bit redundant now, years later, writing about Mann's use of styles to bear out mood and psychological states, his framing devices, his commitment to his craft, but after revisiting the film on Blu-ray, I find myself once again simultaneously invigorated and unnerved by the magnificence of Manhunter. Visually, thematically and narratively it remains a clinical piece of cinema, a probing study of madness that dares to put a serial killer and the man hunting him in the same psychological body, asking us, as well as William Petersen's FBI agent Will Graham, to empathise with Tom Noonan's troubled Tooth Fairy killer. Here's a thing, too, Francis Dolarhyde (The Tooth Fairy) is a functioning member of society, he is quite frankly a man who could be working in a shop near you! This is no reclusive psychopath such as, well, Buffalo Bill, Dolarhyde is presented to us in such a way as we are given insight into this damaged mind, he is fleshed out as a person, we get to know him and his motivational problems.Dream much, Will?Mann and his team are not about over the top or camp performances, gore is kept to a premium, the real horror is shown in aftermath sequences, conversations and harmless photographs, but still it's a nightmarish world. Suspense is wrung out slowly by way of the characterisations. Will has to become the killer, and it's dangerous, he knows so because he has done it before, when capturing Dr. Hannibal Lecktor. Needing to pick up the scent again, to recover the mindset, Will has to go see the good doctor who has a penchant for fine wines and human offal. These scenes showcase Mann at his deadliest, a bright white cell filmed off kilter, each frame switch showing either Lecktor or Graham behind bars, they are one. When Lecktor taunts Will about them being alike, Mann understands this and visually brings it out. Dolarhyde's living abode is murky in colour tones and furnished garishly, and with mirrors, paintings and a lunar landscape, yet when Dolarhyde is accompanied by Joan Allen's blind Reba, where he feels he is finally finding acceptance, this house is seen at ease because of the characterisations. Switch to the finale and it's a walled monstrosity matching that of a killer tipped back over the edge. Brilliant stuff.If one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is.Lecktor, soon to be back as the source material Lecter in the film versions that follow, is actually not in the film that much. Brian Cox (chilling, calculating, frightening and intelligent) as Lecktor gets under ten minutes of screen time, but that's enough, the character's presence is felt throughout the picture in a number of ways. The Lecktor angle is very relative to film's success, but very much it's one strand of a compelling whole, I realise now that Mann has deliberately kept us wanting more of him visually. Noonan is truly scary, he lived away from the rest of the cast during filming, with Mann's joyous encouragement, the end result is one of the best and most complex serial killer characterisations ever. Lang scores high as weasel paparazzi, Allen is heart achingly effective without patronising blind people and Farina is a huge presence as Jack Crawford, Will's friend and boss who coaxes Will back into the fray knowing full well that Will's mind might not make it back with him. But it's Petersen's movie all the way. His subsequent non film career has given ammunition to his knockers that he is no great actor. Rubbish, with this and To Live and Die in L.A. he gave two of the best crime film portrayals of the 80s. He immerses himself in Will Graham, so much so he wasn't able to shake the character off long after filming had wrapped. There's a scene in a supermarket where Will is explaining to his son about his dark place, where ""the ugliest thoughts in the world"" live, a stunning sequence of acting and a showcase for Petersen's undoubted talents.Newcomers to the film and Mann's work in general, could do no worse than spend the ten minutes it takes to watch the Dante Spinotti feature on the disc. Apart from saving me the time to write about Mann's visual flourishes, it gives one an idea of just how key a director and cinematographer partnership is in a film such as this. The audio is crisp, which keeps alive the perfect in tone soundtrack and eerie scoring strains of Rubini and The Reds. Some say that the music of Manhunter is dated? I say that if it sits at one with the tonal shifts and thematics of a story then that surely can never be viewed as dated. And that's the case here in Manhunter. The director's cut is included as part of the package but the transfer is appalling, and for the sake of one cut scene that happens post the Dolarhyde/Graham face off, there's really not much to the DC version anyway. The theatrical cut is perfect, brilliantly realised on Blu-ray to birth a true visual neo-noir masterpiece. 10/10",Manhunter
18,Theo Robertson,Dated But Not Unimpressive,7,24 October 2005,"Comparisons between Michael Mann's MANHUNTER and the other films that followed the Hannibal Lectar franchise are inevitable but unnecessary . Stylistically and context wise MANHUNTER is an entirely different movie from its successors which makes it difficult to say whether it's a better or worse film As a stand alone movie it just about works . The audience needs no pre knowledge of Dr Hannibal Lector because he's very much a peripheral character so much so that if you cut him out of the story no plot changes would be needed at all , in other words Hannibal is a disposable character and to be honest when I first saw this movie in 1990 I found Cox's performance very distracting as I tried to figure out where in the British Isles the accent was from ! Perhaps if Dr Lector didn't appear this film would be entirely forgotten today ? It certainly has little to do with Hannibal the cannibal and concentrates on FBI specialist Will Graham tracking down a serial killer dubbed "" The Tooth Fairy "" Michael Mann directs in a minimalist 80s style which I'm afraid appears somewhat dated viewed today . Mann was well known at the time as the creator of Miami VICE and like the 80s cop show the synthesiser soundtrack coupled with non original rock tracks often seems the most important aspect . In the mid 1980s I was a teenager and used to love movies and TV shows that had pop music playing over the narrative but like I said this type of directorial flourish quickly become dated . Though to be fair to Mann he does manage to bring a depressing and bleak atmosphere to the movie without ever having to resort to blood and gore and gimmicks unlike Ridley Scott did with HANNIBAL If you like murder mysteries or films that have a typically mid 1980s feel then I can certainly recommend MANHUNTER",Manhunter
19,Hey_Sweden,"""It's just you and me now, sport.""",9,12 May 2012,"""Manhunter"" certainly is noteworthy for first introducing us to the character of Hannibal Lecter, five years before ""The Silence of the Lambs"" firmly fixed him in the publics' consciousness. While ""Silence"" is famous and well regarded for good reason, this movie is every bit as good and deserves a look from dedicated thriller fans. Based on the Thomas Harris novel ""Red Dragon"", it follows the actions of a former FBI agent, Will Graham (future 'C.S.I.' star William L. Petersen), who made his name capturing Lecter (here spelled Lecktor). His associate at the Bureau, Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina) appeals to him to help out in their search for a psychopath who butchers entire families every full moon. And the clock is ticking, for the next full moon isn't too far away. Graham has an uncanny ability to get inside the heads of serial killers and think as they do, which he puts to use here (however, this ability is also taking a toll on his mental well-being). Now, folks conditioned to more explicit serial killer films that amp up the body count and ladle on the gloomy atmosphere may be somewhat disappointed with ""Manhunter"", but its subtlety and nuances should be appreciated by others. We don't get introduced to our villain, Francis Dollarhyde (a truly scary Tom Noonan) until past the half way point, and even then we don't purely see him in the act of stalking and killing; we actually see him make a connection to a blind new acquaintance (an appealing Joan Allen) that leads to his downfall just as much as any detective work. And the detective work here is quite compelling, as this film does work as something of a procedural in the various means of working clues. The film is stylishly directed by Michael Mann, who also adapted the novel, and looks great as shot in the 2.35:1 aspect ratio. It begins with an awfully creepy sequence, yet it's careful about doling out any and all shocks, never being in too much of a hurry. Some sequences truly stand out: the fate of sleaze ball journalist Freddie Lounds (Stephen Lang), Reba's (Allen) encounter with a sedated tiger, Francis and Reba spending time together while, unbeknown to her, footage of the next family he intends to slaughter rolls in front of them. The acting from all concerned is effective. Brian Cox has a different take on the role of Lecter than Anthony Hopkins - it's less flashy, but in its own way suitably chilling. Here Lecter plays a similar part to the one he plays in ""Lambs"" as he gets consulted on how to get into the mindset of the killer. Kim Greist, as Grahams' wife, has not much else to do other than be concerned. Familiar faces in the supporting cast include Bill Smitrovich, Peter Maloney, Michael Talbott, Dan Butler, Patricia Charbonneau, Frankie Faison, Garcelle Beauvais, Chris Elliott, and Marshall Bell; buffs will know that Butler and Faison also went on to appear in ""Lambs"" and that Faison has been in all of the adaptations of Harris's Lecter series. The film is long, but worth sticking with; only towards the end does it get a little silly as Graham insists on playing Super Cop. Until then, it's grimly compelling. The story would be filmed again under the ""Red Dragon"" title 16 years later. Nine out of 10.",Manhunter
20,poolandrews,Solid serial killer thriller.,7,20 August 2005,"Manhunter starts with FBI agent Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina) trying to persuade friend & former psychological profiler Will Graham (William Petersen) to come out of retirement & help him catch a brutal serial killer known as 'The Tooth Fairy' (Tom Noonan) who has slaughtered two entire families already. After a few psychological tricks & emotional blackmail Graham agrees, leaving his wife Molly (Kim Greist) & young son Kevin (David Seaman) behind Graham travels to Atlanta & the scene of the Leeds family murders. As Graham walks around the Leeds house he begins to get a feel for the killer & his motives but he still has little to go on except that both killings were committed on a full moon & the next one is fast approaching. He still needs help so Graham decides to visit notorious serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecktor (Brian Cox) & ask for his help but doesn't get anything out of him. Then Lecktor's prison Doctor, Frederick Chilton (Benjamin Hendrickson) discovers a note in Lecktor's cell from the 'Tooth Fairy'. Graham quickly figures out that Lecktor & the 'Tooth fairy' have been communicating with each other by use of a secret code placed in a newspaper advert. Once the FBI have broke the code they find it tells the 'Tooth Fairy' the location of Graham's wife & son, he becomes even more drawn into the case as he desperately tries to unmask the identity of the 'Tooth Fairy' & save both his family & sanity...Written & directed by Michael Mann I thought Manhunter was a good film but not a brilliant one. The script by Mann based on the novel 'Red Dragon' by Thomas Harris is slow burning & concentrates on characters rather than action. The bulk of Manhunter is made up of Graham's attempts to capture the 'Tooth Fairy' rather than showing lots of killings, in fact only two people are actually killed on screen & you can guess who one of those are. Forget about seeing Hannibal Lecktor either, he gets a cameo which amounts to less than five minutes & that's it. Not much background is given to any character as Manhunter likes to deal with the here & now rather than the past, having said that the characters are well fleshed out & you care for them which is essential for a film such as this. Manhunter is a good film that has a gripping storyline, is basically well made & is quite absorbing but was a bit too slow for my tastes & thinking back to it now (I just finished watching it an hour or so ago) nothing sticks in my mind & not that much really happened when all said & done. Forget about any gore or violence as there isn't any, a few gunshot wounds is your lot I'm afraid. The acting is one of Manhunter's strongest points with great performances all over the place from Cox as Lecktor to Petersen as Graham. Technically Manhunter felt bland & unremarkable except for a cool shot when the sun was setting producing a visually great looking backdrop for one scene. I'm not sure about the use of music & songs either, a couple of the songs in Manhunter seemed really out of place & actually annoyed me. So that's it I suppose, there's nothing really wrong with Manhunter as it tells a good solid story but at the same time didn't do anything spectacular or impress me that much. Definitely worth a watch but I much prefer The Silence of the Lambs (1991) to Manhunter in every regard.",Manhunter

As I have always said, a book is a book, and a movie is a movie, and there should not be any comparison in a review.This was an interesting movie in many respects. It was a good thriller; like an episode of ""Law and Order"" and ""CSI"" together. I don't really like Dennis Farina, so I am glad he was just a peripheral player.I like seeing William Petersen long before he was tapped for his ""CSI"" role. I hardly recognized him at first. It is easy to see why he got the role because he exhibited many of the same qualities in this film.Michael Mann (Heat, Miami Vice, Collateral) does a good story in this genre and I really enjoyed his writing and directing of this film.Veteran actor Brian Cox made a great Hannibal Lecktor, and was so much more of what a serial killer should be that later reincarnations of the character.A really interesting movie that was only weakened by the fact that is was in the style of the 80s.",Manhunter
22,view_and_review,How Fortuitous,7,27 January 2020,"This was just dumb luck. I had no idea that Hannibal Lecktor was ever cinematically represented before ""The Silence of the Lambs."" ""Manhunter"" is based upon the book ""Red Dragon"" by Thomas Harris, which was also made into a movie starring Edward Norton in 2002. I don't know if ""Red Dragon"" is a remake of ""Manhunter"" or if it's considered its own thing.""Manhunter"" was good. It's not ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" but it's still good. In this movie Will Graham (William Petersen) is aiding the Atlanta P.D. in finding a killer dubbed the ""Tooth Fairy."" He has a pattern of killing on the full moon which gives Graham and others roughly a month to catch him before he kills again.The trailer I watched for this movie did not do the movie justice at all. After watching the trailer I was very reluctant to watch this movie, but since it was free I watched anyway. It carries much of the same suspense that you find in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" which comes with hunting a psychopathic killer. It was impressive to see the various law enforcement agencies use the best of 80's technology to try to track down the ""Tooth Fairy."" There was no shortage of equipment and no shortage of brain power working around the clock to track him down.Unfortunately, for me there is only one Dr. Lecktor and that's Anthony Hopkins. I never knew who Anthony Hopkins was until his role as Dr. Lecktor. Brian Cox did his best and he was the first, but that role is Hopkins' now.",Manhunter
23,ferguson-6,stuck in the 80's,7,21 August 2001,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Re-visited this one and was disappointed that the film making does not hold up well.  Michael Mann had a real 'reel' feel for the 80's with ""Thief"", ""Miami Vice"" and ""Manhunter"".  Problem is, none of these have held up well over the past 15-20 years.  The thumping, pulsating music now overpowers the film and the story and the performances. However, try to block out the soundtrack, because this story is excellent, and Petersen and Cox shine in their roles.  For those who say this is better than ""Silence of the Lambs"", I say you are living in the past.  Tom Noonan is very creepy as the bad guy ... a much more subtle role than the ""Lambs"" villain, but too many scenes appear to have been rushed to meet a deadline. For another creepy Noonan role, check out 2000's ""The Pledge"" with Jack Nicholson and the wonderful Robin Wright.  I do wish Petersen would do more movie acting, and I trust Michael Mann finally escaped the 80's with ""The Insider"".  I have high hopes for his upcoming ""Ali"" with Will Smith in the title role.  ""Manhunter"" is a good rental, but Anthony Hopkins IS Dr. Lechter.",Manhunter
24,zetes,Awesome. Way better than Silence of the Lambs!,9,29 April 2012,"A tremendous film. Based on the Thomas Harris novel, this was the first appearance of Hannibal Lecter (here spelled Lektor). He's not a huge part of the film. Played by Brian Cox, he serves a lot of the same purpose as he did at the beginning of Silence of the Lambs, as he gives advice about a serial killer to the lead FBI agent on the case (William Petersen). Petersen and Dennis Farina are after a murderer known as the Tooth Fairy, who has murdered two families on nights with a full moon. They're hard at work before that third full moon. As with most Michael Mann films, this is mostly about style, and that style is absolutely gorgeous here. It's very 80s, but Mann takes all the worst tackiness of the decade and makes it look oh so cool. The story is excellent, very breathlessly paced and tense. Creepy Tom Noonan eventually pops up as, of course, the murderer (no spoilers) and Joan Allen plays a blind woman whom Noonan starts to date. I would easily label this as a masterpiece, if it weren't for one completely failed element: William Petersen. That guy is an awful actor. Besides being able to grow a cool 80s beard, I'll never get why anyone ever hired him. Those scenes where he sits alone speaking aloud, trying to get inside the mind of the killer, are laughable. There's also one big plot point that pisses me off (SPOILERS): when Petersen approaches the home of the killer, he sees the guy straddling his next victim with a piece of broken mirror in his hand. Instead of just shooting the guy through the window, he smashes through it with his whole body, lands right next to the guy, allowing himself to get his ass kicked and several cops to be ventilated by Noonan's shotgun. What an idiot!",Manhunter
25,mm-39,Twisted movie,6,23 December 2015,"Manhunter is a twisted movie. A look into a the deranged mind of a psycho. Peterson plays the protagonist who must profile, and catch a serial killer. The depths of depravity is too much. Peterson suffers the emotional stress in order to figure out the inner workings of the sociopath. The protagonist becomes distressed with the case, and needs the help of Hannibal Lecktor. Lecktor knows the detective who captured him is fatigued from the ordeal, and Peterson must struggle with Lecktor. One finds the social depravity hits a new low when (Cox) the Lecktor character is introduced. Cox portrays a colder and harder Lecktor, better than the Hopkin's role of the evil doctor. Mann directs Manhunter in a 1980's (Miami Vice) music, blue lighting, cold/direct, and blunt style. Manhunter left an impression on me. Maybe too effective of a movie. Six out of ten stars.",Manhunter
26,Mr-Fusion,Brimming with style,9,24 October 2012,"Since both movies share Dr. Lecter in common, you can't help but compare ""The Silence of the Lambs"" with ""Manhunter"". And both of them are fantastic movies, so this clearly isn't a contest. That having been said, ""Manhunter does have Brian Cox as the psychotic doctor, and it's such a resonant performance. He does so much with so little screen time (seriously, the guy's like a footnote in the grand scheme of things) and you feel like he's a real person. Really scary, 'natch.But ""Manhunter"" is above all a Michael Mann film, and that's what I love about it. It has the mood and color use of ""Miami Vice"", a great eye for visual compositions, and it's psycho-thriller-as-police-procedural. There's energy to be found even in the usually mundane lab scenes, so the whole thing comes off understated yet kinetic.

This the original Lecter flick focuses on the manhunt while delving into the disturbing think-like-a-cannibal mindset which Agent Graham must achieve with the help of his old adversary in order to catch the killer. More of a traditional whodunnit-style drama, ""Manhunter"" trades sensationalism for realism by emphasizing the hero over the villain. A solid journeyman flick with no huge stars, ""Manhunter"" makes for an intriguing watch which requires less dumbing-down by the viewer than either ""Silence..."" or ""Hannibal"".",Manhunter
29,MovieAddict2016,"About on par with ""Silence of the Lambs"" in my opinion",7,22 August 2005,"""Manhunter"" was the first actual Hannibal Lector movie, although his name is ""Lecktor"" in this version. It was based off of the Thomas Harris novel ""Red Dragon,"" which writer-director Michael Mann adapted himself and transformed into a very different kind of film.It was remade in 2002 as ""Red Dragon"" starring Edward Norton, Harvey Keitel, and of course Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal. (It was, in my opinion, the best movie of the series so far - though many disagree.) ""Manhunter"" is almost as good, and about on par with ""Silence of the Lambs"" in my opinion. William Peterson (""To Live and Die in L.A.,"" TV's ""CSI"") plays the role of Will Graham, an ex-detective drawn out of retirement by a cop named Jack (Dennis Farina, who you might have also seen on TV a few times before, har-har) to hunt down a serial killer who seems to be choosing his victims at random.Will enlists the help of imprisoned serial killer Hannibal Lecktor (Brian Cox, ""Adaptation"") to track down the serial killer.First things first: this movie is NOT a Hannibal Lecktor film. It's a Will Graham film. Lecktor is in it a bit, but his presence is not as strong. It's not as intellectual and subtle as ""Silence of the Lambs,"" which is ironic because Mann is actually quite a subtle director. It's more of a bloody, gory thriller rather than a quiet serial killer film.Then again, I think ""Red Dragon"" always was more of a horror-thriller than the others. (Hannibal had yet to be truly developed in the novel.) Mann does a good job of creating a solid thriller that's scary, suspenseful and surprising.The acting isn't as strong as ""Red Dragon"" or ""Lambs"" (I won't mention Ridley Scott's ""Hannibal"") and Cox isn't as impressive as Anthony Hopkins. But overall I liked the film better.I really enjoyed Mann's direction (as always) and found it more entertaining than ""Silence of the Lambs,"" which I think is overrated (good, but nevertheless overrated).If you liked ""Silence of the Lambs,"" you may not like this, because it's a big change. And if you saw ""Red Dragon,"" you might prefer Brett Ratner's vision for the series. However, I personally think ""Manhunter"" is a well-made, underrated suspense film - the forgotten entry in the Hannibal Lecktor/Lecter series, and a movie that should be seen regardless of your blind love for all things Hopkins.",Manhunter
30,Red-Barracuda,Excellent serial killer thriller,9,28 April 2013,"Manhunter kind of went under the radar when it was released in 1986. It wasn't until the massive success of The Silence of the Lambs five years later that it started to become more widely noticed. The reason, of course, is that Manhunter is the first cinematic outing for the character Hannibal Lector - made so iconic in Lambs by Anthony Hopkins. In this movie he goes under the different spelling of 'Lecktor' and he is played by Brian Cox. There has been a fair amount of debate as to which is the better performance. I personally think both are great but very different. Hopkins is considerably more over the top albeit very well controlled; whereas Cox plays the character in a subdued way. There is considerably more ambiguity about his Lecktor. He and his sterile cell appear more realistic than Hopkins in his dimly lit dungeon. This approach makes this Hannibal a more intimidating one in some respects. He hides his psychopathic nature far more but, of course, we know it's there. He seems more normal and by extension, deadlier. Like before, in this film Lecktor has an acolyte serial killer actively working on the outside, in Lambs it was Buffalo Bill, while here it is the Tooth Fairy. Tom Noonan is excellent playing the latter, unlike Buffalo Bill he is portrayed with an element of sympathy at times. Noonan is very good at showing the lack of self-esteem that is in some way connected with his psychopathic violent tendencies.The story itself follows the character Will Graham, a criminal analyst who has the ability to enter the mind-set of a killer. This skill makes him highly adept at catching maniacs but extremely vulnerable to mental breakdown. His previous exertions in catching Hannibal Lecktor had made him quit the FBI. At the beginning of the film he is persuaded to return to service to hunt a serial killer who has just murdered two families.Manhunter is a very different film stylistically to Silence of the Lambs. Both may come from novels by Thomas Harris and also share broadly similar plot-lines but the look and feel are entirely different. This film is directed by Michael Mann who was the creator of the Miami Vice TV series and the later acclaimed thriller Heat. He is a visual stylist and this factor is evident throughout Manhunter. He makes consistently great use of colour and framing. The visual polish is at odds with the gritty material. I would guess for some viewers this will be a weakness but I felt that in some ways it made the disturbing aspects of the story slightly creepier in that they stood out more glaringly against the sheen of the presentation. The underplayed performances also contributed to this, the horror of the events didn't need being overplayed; they spoke for themselves. The soundtrack is more variable in effectiveness. For the most part it worked alongside the visuals very well but there were some 80's rock tunes that were a little cheesy; Iron Butterfly's In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, however, was well used in the nerve-jangling climax.",Manhunter
31,Rainey-Dawn,Great Film - Underrated,8,1 October 2021,"I have to admit that this film is great - it might be better than the Red Dragon movie. What saddens me is that Hannibal Lector doesn't play a big part in the film, which is a shame because Brian Cox was great in the role.IF you enjoy the Hannibal Lector films/books then I highly recommend you to watch Manhunter!!8/10.",Manhunter

33,thesar-2,The Better Dragon of the Two Red Ones,5,15 October 2009,"Despite the very unfortunate and clichéd title such as 'Manhunter,' it's sad this little tight suspense film didn't get more notoriety when it hit theatres in 1986. There are a lot of huge positives in reference to the book it's based on, 'Red Dragon' (why they changed the movie title escapes me.) For, they got the Will, Freddy, Reba and Francis characters down to the tee, especially and mainly Will (William Peterson). Tell me, this wasn't Peterson's audition tape for 'CSI.' They were all but one in the same people. Another thing they got right (and later, the remake 'Red Dragon' got horribly wrong) was the just snippets of Dr. Hannibal Lecter (along with the title change, they somehow managed to spell his name wrong. It's a wonder if they read the source material.) This isn't a 'Hannibal' film, though it introduces him and thankfully, author Harris saw something in Lecter as he's an enormously interesting character and spawned more books/movies specifically centered around him. The bad in this film is the deletion of some key plot points/characters, such as Francis's Grandmother and his trip to the museum. Sure, the movie can't go on forever, but like most of Mann's films, he wastes a lot of time with very SLOW moving, I suspect ""tension building"" scenes but in reality, it's just slow. The movie's horribly dated in action and music – and at times overbearing to the action on screen. And the ending was downright hilariously bad, terribly edited and psychedelic. So, that kinds of ruins any tension Mann slowed down shots might have raised. The plot revolves around retired FBI Will hunting a serial-family killer before the next full moon and the affects it has on him and his own family. Watchable, but just about average.Side note: I don't generally read/watch videos a lot about the movie prior to my review, such as quotes, trailers, other people's comments, trivia or goofs, so in order not to ruin my opinion. I'm sure the goof I will mention has been noted before. It was hilarious in the grocery store as the products behind Will & son continued to change as they stood still. Unfortunately that broke the tension it was attempting to build.Overall, I liked the movie – oodles better than the Edward Norton/Anthony Hopkins 'Red Dragon' version. I've read the book and loved how Peterson portrayed Will Graham. He was quiet, thoughtful, and powerful even in his silence whereas Norton was loud, dumb and spoke way too much. He also looked years younger than the character he was supposed to be. Joan Allen was perfect, and it was creepy as she had to sit there and ""not watch"" the home videos. Finally, Noonan was one hundred times scarier than Fiennes. Seriously, who wouldn't be scared of 6'7"" man vs. someone, what, 5'11"" on heels?",Manhunter
34,sol-kay,Tale of the Dragon,8,22 November 2003,"********SPOILERS******** ""Manhunter"" is about an FBI agent Will Graham, William Petersen, who's job of getting into the minds of vicious serial killers and start thinking like them in order to be able to catch them, as well as a brutal physical attack by Lector, landed him in the hospital with a mental and physical breakdown and had him retire from the agency with a service related disability. At the start of the movie Graham is asked by his friend and FBI agent Jack Crawford, Dennis Farina, if he can come out of retirement and help in a case that has the FBI and the local police stymied. There's been two brutal murders of families in two different cities, Birmingham AL and Atlanta GA. that evidence shows were committed by the same killer. But there seems to be no connection why they were targeted except that they accrued when there was a full moon. The FBI now feel that he'll strike again the next time the moon is full. Graham goes back to work with the FBI to solve the murders but as soon as he does his mental state starts to suffer when he tries to think and act like the killer. Even worse with the help of Dr. Hannibal Lector,that's how they spell it in the movie ""Manhunter"", Brian Cox, the serial killer that Agent Graham put behind bars that led to his breakdown incites the killer to target him and his family. Based on the book ""Red Dragon"" by Thomas Harris the film is more effective even though not as extravagant as the three Anthony Hopkins films about Dr. Lecter. With the Dr. Lecter in this movie being more reserved and normal he thus comes across as more of a psychopath and far more dangerous then the Anthony Hopkins Lecter. The crazed Anthony Hopkins doctor Lecter was so off the wall with his eyes bugging out of his head and almost drooling from the mouth that it made him look more like a cartoon then a person. Even the killer in ""Manhunter"" Francis Dallarhyde, Tom Noonan, is also more normal in his relations with those around him. Dallarhyde even has a sweet girlfriend Reba McClane, Joan Allen, who thinks that he's creative, then the killer ""Buffalo Bill"" in the Anthony Hopkins version ""Silence of the Lambs"" which makes Dallarhyde far more dangerous because he can easily fool you until it's to late. Agent Graham correctly hit's the target almost at once; The mode of operation of the killer and that It's visual which Graham couldn't at first understand. But there's one important clue that takes him until the end of the film to decipher, it has to do with what the killers blind girlfriend does for a living. And with that key Graham unlocks the mystery and sets the stage for the movies smashing and explosive final.",Manhunter
35,lost-in-limbo,Absorbing film that oozes with gloss!,9,17 September 2005,"Will Graham (William Petersen) an gifted FBI agent in the field of forensics has the ability to think like a killer and this is the reason why he's persuaded out of retirement to help in a nationwide manhunt of a crazed serial murderer called the Tooth Fairy (Tom Noonan) that the FBI can't seem to get any clues on. The pieces start to fit in Will's profile of the killer who is murdering families on a lunar cycle, so now it's a race against time to stop him slaughtering another family in the next full moon. One thing that hits you about it straightaway is the strong 80's awe, so it feels really dated, but honestly it didn't disappoint me, as what we get is an intelligent and polished effort by Michael Mann. Don't be expecting whole lot of energy and action, as it's an incredibly slow and realistic set-up, with moody performances and a plot that is a thought provoking mystery piece, which has its grisly moments mixed into many subtle and haunting situations. Gladly it doesn't overplay any of their characters or gimmicks, especially its killer. Anyhow, this prequel is basically overshadowed by ""Silence of the Lambs"" which is a good film, but I just don't get the hype that surrounds it. I guess I'm of a small minority when I say I would actually watch this over ""Silence of the Lambs"" any day. And there's ""Hannibal""; lets not go there. Also throw in ""Red Dragon"", but I haven't come across it. But, it would be interesting to compare that version to ""Manhunter"". Definitely depressing in tone, with a certain amount of emotional drive that compounds this slick thriller. The plot closely builds on Petersen's characters' torment and how he becomes so close to the killer that he studies; it affects his life and the way he thinks. And no, it isn't a Lecktor film. But when Lecktor and Graham shared the screen, the burning conversation they had was uneasy. Basically the plot concentrates more on Petersen's FBI agent, rather than the serial killer. And, I just found the attention to Graham's determination and effort to capturing the killer rather gripping and incredibly well driven. It's a smart screenplay that closely draws on the victims more than anything. Tension and horror is built up in a slow manner to reach its thumping conclusion. The performances were top-notch, especially that of William Petersen who nails the part of the scarred FBI agent Will Graham with conviction. I thought he was somewhat of an underrated actor. Brian Cox as Hannibal Lecktor was subtly eerie and hardly over-the-top (like Hopkins) in the small amount of scenes he got. Tom Noonan striking features and quiet tone suited the role perfectly as the serial killer called the Tooth fairy. There's also some good supporting roles from the likes of Dennis Farina, Joan Allen and Kim Greist. Mann's direction is remarkably stylish and well executed, he creates some brilliant sequences and that especially goes for smacking and high-octane climax. Cinematography by Dante Spinotti is beautifully set-up with the many angles and well-constructed shots that truly catch your eye and really make you pay notice. The lush visuals and rich colour patterns are incredibly vibrant. With good use of lighting. The Reds groovy electronic score might feel out of place at times, but still it had an enchanting nature and powerful punch. Overall, it's an intelligent and slow grinding film that is directed with flair by Michael Mann.",Manhunter
36,MOscarbradley,Surprisingly toothless.,6,27 August 2020,"Of all the films to feature Hannibal Lecter, Michael Mann's ""Manhunter"" maybe the most subtle and probably the least obvious. It was based on Thomas Harris' book ""Red Dragon"" which was subsequently filmed with Hopkins reprising his role as Lecter but with very little subtlety and a lot of gore. Here Lecter is a superb Brian Cox in a performance that doesn't make you think of Hopkins at all. Unfortunately he's only on screen for a few short scenes. The rest of the time we have to endure William Petersen's one-note performance as Will Graham, the supposedly smart F.B.I. agent on the case. Personally I could never see Petersen catching a fly on fly paper let alone Lecter or the Tooth Fairy.If Petersen is a problem the other problem is Mann himself. For some reason he's decided to turn ""Manhunter"" into an art-house movie devoid of the excitement a good serial-killer chiller needs. It's magnificently shot by Dante Spinotti but it doesn't engage you and it's climax is ... well, anti-climatic to say the least. No pun intended but Hopkins' Lecter had bite; this Tooth Fairy is a curiously toothless beast. If ""The Silence of the Lambs"" sequels were crude affairs at least you knew they were there. This one just disappears as you're watching it.",Manhunter
37,bowmanblue,Sir Anthony not included,7,21 February 2016,"Yes, believe it or not, the award-winning 'Silence of the Lambs' wasn't the launch-platform for one of cinema's greatest villains – Dr Hannibal Lecter. In fact, he was with us back in the eighties, albeit in the guise of one Brian Cox. Now, many dismissed this as an inferior film to 'Lambs' and, indeed, it doesn't really fit with what is basically the 'Hannibal trilogy,' i.e. Lambs, Hannibal and Red Dragon. However, it doesn't mean it's a bad film.Just because we have a few names we recognise (mainly Dr Lecter, but if you're familiar with Silence of the Lambs you may also remember the name 'Jack Crawford') don't go thinking it fits neatly into Sir Anthony's take on the charismatic cannibal. It's kind of its own body of work with Brian Cox giving us a very different take on Dr Lecter. Whereas in Lambs Dr Lecter was basically the star (certainly more memorable than poor old Jodie Foster, who couldn't compete with Anthony Hopkins when it came to great and devilish lines) in Manhunter, he's kind of a side character, only in a few scenes and only just about relevant to the plot.Here, a former FBI agent comes out of retirement to catch a killer, nicknamed 'The Tooth Fairy.' And he pretty much goes about tracking the beast down, only popping in once or twice to get his old pal Dr Lecter's opinion on the goings on. Okay, so maybe I'm being a bit flippant – there's more to it than that, but not an awful lot more. It's not about Dr Lecter, that's what people who have seen Hannibal etc need to know before they invest a couple of hours of their lives into watching it. It's basically an FBI agent tracking down a killer, but that's not so bad.For a start the direction is pretty cool. Yes, it all looks a little too eighties in places, but the shots are pretty nicely done – often filtered in blues and reds, depending on the danger level. Plus you have the soundtrack. Although that will appeal more to people who are fans of electro eighties music. Having grown up in the decade that fashion forgot, I approve of the film's score.Don't go expecting an Anthony Hopkins Hannibal performance. Brian Cox is far less 'Pantomime' and much more understated, but, what he may lack in overt menacing, Tom Noonan more than makes up for in general sickness, so if you're into your serial killers, he should provide the creepiness factor.It's not Hannibal. It's something else – an eighties serial killer hunting movie. If that's your thing, give it a go (just close your eyes when men in tight pink shorts come on!).",Manhunter
38,Bored_Dragon,First Hannibal,7,29 June 2018,"The first movie about Hannibal Lecter, based on a book ""Red Dragon"". Not as good as ""Silence of the Lambs"", but anyhow, it is a good movie with a great cast.7/10",Manhunter
39,tabuno,One of the Best Movies Ever Made,10,27 January 2019,"3 July 2002. I had to read through the comment index twice to make sure that I had never commented on this film. Before there was Silence or the Lambs or Hannibal, before CSI, William Petersen starred in an amazingly similar role (of his now famous, number one hit television series) in the movie Manhunter, which I consider one of the best movies ever made. I can understand some of the criticisms written about this movie, but it really depends on what you look for in a movie. For me, this movie had realism, a stylish seriousness that didn't try to make fancy, polished statements. The dialogue was real, hard-hitting something you could listen and hear in real life, but in a dramatic - slice of life way, hitting the key points in a murder investigation.Yes, there were many, many slow moments, but real moments - a father and his son in a grocery store - that scene was polished, wasn't acted to perfection. This scene was one real kid talking about his fears, he wasn't even looking at the camera or his father, just off into space like a real kid. The investigation process was smooth, methodical, scientific and luck. There was the early scene in the meeting room which played out as in real life - and the Tooth Angel - comment was portrayed as a serious event even though people laughed. The serial killer was real, even sympathetic at times. And Hannibal was even more scary because he was so cool, somebody without a soul but who could be charming as a good salesman on the phone.There really isn't a bad scene that I can find in this movie and I've scene the movie perhaps ten times. The music blended well into the fear and excitement, drama and tension without being overwhelming. The deaths were not for shock value for themselves but as stated factual reality - sometimes death is bloody, but not for cheap thrills for moviegoers.The seen where police come to protect some innocent people was a great scene of (what I would think) were real police officers talking as they would normally, ""I think you better go into the house ma'am."" It was anything like in the mothers. That scene by the police wasn't acted it was a re-enactment of what would really happen, and it was compelling, dramatic. Yet, the movie at the same time amazingly never came across like real TV. There were production values, there were lines performed, but they were performed with serious intention, to communicate more dramatically what occurs in real life. The movie was like a photograph that was touched up to make the edges appear sharper, the colors more brilliant. There were dramatic ocean scenes, stark blood-bathed bedroom scenes.The characters were memorable, their relations with other characters moving, the plot riveting in its steering away from typical Hollywood productions, playing over the top, shooting, mayhem, action just for special effects sake. Nothing was done in this movie but to really let the audience soak in the experience - the building tempo, building urgency of crime investigation, the humanity of the people killed and those targeted for death. The only flaw was the reporter who really was the only character who for whatever reason was a stereotype of tabloid journalism.I would recommend this movie to any one who cares about murder mystery in a slow, methodical way that builds into a more heart-pounding climax. It is definitely not all action, blood and guts, it is an intellectually stimulating thinking, feeling movie that even those emotional women and men might be able to appreciate. This is a must see if you like to soak in the colors, the hard edges of step by step forensics and a no-holds barred snap shots of style and substance combined into one sleeper of a movie that Anthony Hopkins will have a real challenge in starring in a remake. 10 out of 10.",Manhunter
40,kenjha,"Oh, Mann!",2,17 January 2010,"An FBI agent who specializes in catching serial killers comes out of retirement to track a psycho who idolizes Hannibal Lecktor. Peterson is laughably bad as the cop who is so passionate about his job by golly that he endangers his family and breaks into impromptu monologues directed at the killer. Initially, the film gets so bogged down in the minutiae of police work that it's simply boring, then suddenly the focus shifts to the killer's romance with a blind woman. Huh? Mann's overly flashy style is better suited to music videos or toothpaste ads than a feature film. The director's tendency to randomly use weird camera angles and slow motion is quite distracting.

42,slightlymad22,My Favourite Movie Featuring Hannibal Lector,8,29 November 2016,"Plot In A Paragraph: Former FBI profiler Will Graham (William Prterson) returns to service to pursue a deranged serial murderer named ""the Tooth Fairy"" by the media.Giving much bigger roles to William Peterson and Dennis Farina, both actors he had used in his first movie Thief, Mann is back on more familiar and solid ground following his misstep with The Keep. Hands down Manhunter is my favourite movie featuring the character Hannibal Lector. I actually rented this movie on video the same day I rented Twins. I'm not too sure if there was a delayed release or if the video case was just placed back in the wrong place but I didn't see it years later. This is a brilliantly directed, excellently acted, intense movie that sucks you in and drags you along with it. As with Thief, we get a nice Beach shots, with lots of shots of the ocean early on as we see Graham enjoying his retirement. Similar to how Caan was shown enjoying his life after his supposed last job in Thief. Once again we get another other great score too. Mann sure does know how to pick his composers. As for Petersen, he stars in two of my favourite mid 80's movies, this and To Live & Die In LA, yet other than those, Young Guns 2 and a remake of 12 Angry Men I down recall seeing him in anything agin till the CSI shows. I'm surprised as he is handsome, in good shape and he could act.With an $8 million domestic gross Manhunter finished the year the 76th highest grossing movie of 1986.",Manhunter
43,paulclaassen,Went from reasonably fast-paced and interesting to slow and almost boring.,4,17 February 2021,"I must be honest, I never realized there was a Hannibal Lecter film (spelled Lecktor in 'Manhunter') before 'Silence of the Lambs'. As I'm not a big fan of reading books, I wasn't familiar with the original novel 'Red Dragon', on which the film is based.'Manhunter' is a very thorough detective murder mystery horror thriller. Lecktor is excellently portrayed by Brian Cox, but it is a pity he received such little screen time. I found William Petersen a bit too reserved as Will Graham, the film's protagonist. His character (and the actor himself) didn't seem enthusiastic enough.The film's first half is very well scripted, but the film went from reasonably fast-paced and interesting to slow and rather boring the moment the killer showed up. I (almost) completely lost interest during this second half. So much so that I might have difficulty remembering the film after a while. I therefore rather suggest watching the Hannibal Lecter trilogy featuring Anthony Hopkins. Much better! 'Manhunter' is also laden with obvious editing errors.Would I watch it again? No.",Manhunter
44,Dr_Coulardeau,The monster is born,9,23 June 2009,"The first episode of Doctor Lecter, before ""The Silence of the Lamb"" and ""Hannibal"". The Doctor is already in prison and he is already playing from there with some serial killers and the FBI. But the book is slightly still in construction, and the film is too. We do have the serial killer, and the new technique of profiling. But it is still not entirely squared out. The FBI man is still relying on his instinct, his sixth sense, his intuition, his inner eye to understand the feelings and the thoughts of the killer and capture him by being able to foresee what he is going to do. But that paranormal element is not convincing, though it is commonly used in some detective TV series. Thomas Harris is going to get to real profiling only in the next volume. Even the great visionary power of Doctor Lecter will become the unavoidable logic of the mind, of the psyche, of the deranged mental power of the insane doctor only then. He is a genius in his psychiatric field and his derangement gives him the capability to know no limits. But that is still to come. Here though Thomas Harris settles some accounts with journalists and has one burnt alive. He also settles some revenge with story telling and twists the story line in some unforeseen ways now and then. These moments are magic in a way since they are unexplained and they restart the dynamic of the tale that could have become humdrum. The story seems to settle some accounts with a couple of commonplace if not trite ideas. The whole logic of the killer is to think that his being seen over and over again by a women during the last five minutes of their lives as if their eyes were silver mirrors would lead him to be loved and to come to terms with his desire to kill. His last victim actually loves him in a way and/but she is blind. She loves him because she is blind and he kills her out of no reason and she will not be able to ""see"" him when she dies. Of course that victim will survive because our FBI man-hunter will come into the picture unannounced. Thomas Harris also deals with the idea that all serial killers were boys who were mistreated when children, probably by their parents, even more probably somewhere by their mothers. That kind of a cliché is so simple that it does not sound true nor serious, some kind of a joke, maybe a big wink with a grin at the nasty and dirty mind of the reader. But this cliché will be present in absolutely all the Doctor Lecter books, in a way or another. In this case it is really superficial. It is interesting to see, after reading it, this first episode in the story of Doctor Lecter, first episode as it came out of the mind of its author because we can see and feel the genetic dimension of the saga, because it was to become a saga and today it even has become a cultish trip into criminal insanity.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID",Manhunter
45,johnnyboyz,Could well be one of the most unfaithful adaptations ever made.,4,15 February 2007,"Having recently finished the novel and having seen the other adaptations, I was eagerly looking forward to seeing the first Lecter film ever made. This turned out, however, as a huge anticlimax.As a book, the story worked; but as seen in 'Manhunter', the evidence suggests that it wasn't material that was good enough to transfer to the silver screen although Brett Ratner did do a fine job in his version so that proves that it is possible. Here, in the 1986 version, the adaptation is just an absolute mess.First of all, the film has aged terribly. I would go as far to say it has aged in the same vein as 'Top Gun' as it's clearly the 1980's with music, costume and hair playing a big part in convincing us this film is very questionable as to take seriously or not. These things that have not aged not only make Manhunter more of a comic viewing but also take away any psychological feeling of uneasiness that might have been there (and was in Ratner's version) if the film had been done properly. The music is very inappropriate given the film's theme and content. A serial killer in a psychological/detective thriller is killing these families and generally causing havoc so what kind music do we hear? Cheesy 80's pop music; that's what and it's not even done intentionally as it was with 'Stuck in the Middle With You' from 'Reservoir Dogs'. This makes it more comic than disturbing. The film also feels like it's in a rush. Characters act and talk far too quickly to know what's going on and it's only because I had read the book and seen Ratner's version that I could fathom any kind of clues as to how they were getting nearer to the killer. This would suggest that people who haven't read the book will be in absolute disarray when watching it, which isn't good. In fact, those who have read the book will probably feel like I felt when viewing it: a little insulted.Numerous things are missing from the novel which made it so effective and which made the killer so effectively disturbing. For one, the killer is hardly in this film; we only see him eliminate a certain character and more towards the end when he starts his relationship with Reba. Secondly, there is no hint of his past whatsoever and nor does it mention his grandmother whom is, basically, the reason for his killings. Thirdly, the fact he lives in a modern looking apartment as opposed to the large, creepy old house that he did in the book completely infuriated me as it served the basis for his evilness. It's mentioned that the killer lived and grew up in that house, suffered his abuse in that house and wasn't used to going to other people's more modern houses (like Reba's in the book and Ratner's version) building up a dangerous profile of him that he is severally alienated from most up-to-date people. In this film, it's all wrong.Another thing is Hannibal Lecter himself. The filmmakers couldn't even spell his name correctly in this film; let alone get his persona right. Brian Cox portrays Lecter in a way in which he is more akin to a locked up east-end, London gangster than a mass murderer/cannibal. He talks too quickly and too colloquially, destroying any sophistication which should have been present in the film. In the book, special attention is paid to the ways in which Lecter moves; his tiny instances of body language are described but here, everything you thought you knew about Lecter is annihilated in an instance. Here, Lecter talks in an everyday way, sits with his feet up on the wall and talks down the phone like a laid back guy, lying on a sofa. There're also no references to his cultural knowledge. No pictures or no paintings on the wall; nothing. Just a few books.What also drives Manhunter towards the tag of 'Hollywood nonsense' is the way it builds its final third. The killer's relationship with Reba is dealt with far too quickly in a filmic sense and the touching scenes involving him making his way to the museum to eat the painting were left out; destroying the fact that he was undergoing a change due to his love for Reba (who is blind, by the way!). The way in which the police storm the house towards the end, crashing through windows like in a 'Lethal Weapon' film was just insulting and the way in which he was finally dealt with was equally bad.Unfortunately, Manhunter is a real disappointment and those that say they like it; well, I really can't see why. If this is your first taste of the Harris/Lecter series then so-be-it but expect much better things when you watch the others.",Manhunter
46,leplatypus,Watchable because Subtle (web),7,7 May 2017,"I didn't know that my last movie with Kim was about this degenerate (as David Lynch told) character of Hannibal! But while all the others movies are famous, this one is rather leftover and it's a pity because it's a very tense thriller and very cautious movie: Unlike the nauseating Scott movie that keeps on talking and showing the thing, here it's always unexposed and you don't see anything. So on the other hand, the psychological tension is really high and with Mann stylized directing (big frame, slow pace), the movie keeps on playing with your nerves and sometimes it's even very ironic: Manhunter talks about Hannibal with his son in a grocery store! The next female victim drinks with a long, thick glass in front of this sexual pervert! ...The cast is really excellent: the Manhunter is a newcomer for me and he is really good to play his torments; Noonan is always impressive with his dark nutty parts and if Kim is indeed totally wasted in her small part, she is always this same cute girl!

48,Anonymous_Maxine,Manhunter is a perfect example of how easily a truly exceptional crime novel can be badly screwed up when made into a movie.,4,20 August 2000,"Did you read the novel ""Red Dragon,"" by Thomas Harris, the book on which Manhunter is based? If not, watch the movie, you'll probably love it. However, if you have read the book, be advised that the movie will disappoint you in every way you can imagine.Red Dragon was just a great book. The story was intense, and it was extremely difficult to put down. Given that, it is hard for me to understand what would make Michael Mann think that he should change anything in the story. While not necessarily really pretty, the ending in the book was different and completely unexpected. It left you with that ""wow"" feeling that is so satisfying, especially when you almost unconsciously expect a flowery ending. I would have LOVED to see that put on film! But no, Mann decides to scrap the surprise ending and slap on a cutesy Hollywood ending. That really p****s me off. Can I say that? And it's not just the ending, by the way, there were enormous chunks of the story that were simply not included in the film. ENORMOUS chunks of the story. This movie would have been so much better if it remained faithful to the full story presented in the book.Not only that, but they obviously hired some idiot to do the casting. Brian Cox performs horribly as the evil supergenius Hannibal Lector, but that may be a result of the fact that I had already seen Anthony Hopkins' performance of the same character (one of the best performances I have ever seen on film) before I saw Manhunter. I'm sure Michael Mann felt like a complete idiot when Silence of the Lambs was released. Tom Noonan was HORRIBLY miscast as Francis Dolarhyde, the insecure serial killer in Manhunter. Oh, did you not know that he was insecure? That's because those idiots didn't put anything about that in the movie, even though this extreme insecurity (the background of which was also left out of the film) is the fundamental reason for Dolarhyde's homicidal tendencies.If you liked this movie, I can understand why. It was an entertaining enough film. But I can also tell that if you liked this movie you did not read the book. The book is about 10,000 times better than the movie, and the conversion from book to film is so manipulative and disappointing and generally poor that once you realize what has been left out, it is almost painful to watch. Basically, what they did was they took a spectacular book and made it into a run-of-the-mill crime film. For shame.",Manhunter
49,jzappa,A Healthy Shift in One's Gauge for Judgment,7,1 June 2010,"What I find intriguing about Manhunter is both what makes it appealing and what makes it less impactful than it could have been. That is Michael Mann's stylistic comportment, his handling of Thomas Harris' material as one of his trademark masculine crime thrillers. It falls under the umbrella of Heat, Thief and Collateral. Seeing it in this way makes it appealing because of how the gruesome elements are taken in stride with Mann's modern police procedural flavor, again casting wonderful real-life cop turned character actor Dennis Farina for good realistic measure. But just as well, the impact is dulled by what a subsequent trilogy has shown to be Mann's comparatively narrow vision. The Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal and even Red Dragon were given such potency by such utterly fascinating and memorable characters. Mann keeps himself at arm's length from them by foregrounding the mechanical and methodical aspects the plot.Still, Manhunter is definitely a very effective dramatic thriller, because procedure, physicality and technology are not only Mann's idiosyncrasies but his approach to his characters. He skillfully and almost subliminally injects the film with an undercurrent of inner panic. Part of this is because of the implicit inference that, in his capture of the diabolical Dr. Lector, Detective Will Graham's approach of putting himself in the place of sociopathic killers may have led him to having unsound feelings towards his own family. This is something, it is delicately conveyed, Graham has never entirely recovered from, a thought suggested by the nature of his reluctance to come out of retirement to track a serial killer of entire families known as The Tooth Fairy, a thought that still lingers in light of the pawn of a Hollywood denouement. But where the sense of the repressed is most externally evident is in the way the otherwise suave Graham always appears to be diminished by the film's attention-drawing modernist architecture and design (which oddly works as the exterior for a mental asylum), as well as in the way the rhythm of the film suddenly shifts from drawn-out scenes with the pensive Graham to eruptions of racking terror and brutality.Manhunter opens with a scary middle ground between both: The camera, chaperoned by a nasalizing 1980s synthesizer, tracks the beam of a flashlight through a pitch black house, up a staircase, to a bedroom where a couple slumbers. The beam settles on the wife, who stirs, then sits up and gazes into the harsh light, whereupon the image goes black. The point has been made. This has been the caravan of The Tooth Fairy, who will massacre these people and their children, though it could also be Graham's conception as he relives the night of butchery while fixing on crime-scene dailies and blood-tainted chalk lines. They're sharing a fearful rapport.I know it is not at all fair hinging criticism of Manhunter on a comparison to Red Dragon, which was based on the same first novel of Hannibal Lector, because between the two, Manhunter is definitely the better film. Red Dragon is part of Hannibal's official film series which deeply explores not only Dr. Lector but the emotional gamut of each character, but Brett Ratner's version gives us hollow scenery characters and is far from faithful to the nature of Dr. Lector. What makes Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal so extraordinarily formidable is that he has the forethought of a genius, having risen so far above the collective conscious that he can scarcely be troubled by the comparatively negligent and inactive view of the ordinary person, even a famously brilliant FBI psychological profiler. Red Dragon nearly butchered this sense. Manhunter is superior because it neither augments or diminishes the character, played by Brian Cox. It is a separate film, interested in other things.It is actually a healthy shift in one's gauge for judgment to see a completely removed take on Anthony Hopkins' trademark character, who has not only risen high above the collective conscious but cut deeply into it. Manhunter is the objective angle, before Lambs shifted the whole paradigm on Harris' ominous creations. Declining any comparisons is the key to enjoying Manhunter. Indeed it can actually be fascinating to see Cox take Lector on an entirely different trajectory, Mann seeming completely unaware of the untapped watershed he had in the palm of his hands. He's kind of like Mike Yanagita in Fargo, a character from the cop protagonist's past with only peripheral involvement in the action but functions as a necessary thematic connector to a character in the cop protagonist's present. Regardless, Mann is fixated on the anxiety and torment of the hunter more than his psychotic quarry, and with that focus on voyeurism it is very effective.Here, Tom Noonan's creepy rendition of The Tooth Fairy is the more interesting psychopath, a deeply tormented soul, responsible for monumentally monstrous acts, finding compassion for the first time in his life at the same time Graham is mercilessly hunting him down. Noonan's look is what lends him such presence as a character actor, an imposing six-foot-six menace, another figure by which Graham is dwarfed. Played by William L. Petersen, Graham seems to reflect Mann's uninflected cerebral self-involvement. And it seems to have bred a slew of subsequent film and TV thrillers harboring categorically cultish depictions of forensics, as well as sole protagonists who roam fresh crime scenes alone in order to dive headlong into a sociopath's upsetting animus. Manhunter paved the way for the age of insight into the devil, which is vital to depicting him.",Manhunter
50,videorama-759-859391,"Petersen is the man, hunting a sicko, in one of the 80's most engrossing films",9,28 May 2014,"Manhunter is a much overlooked movie, that didn't play in some states in Australia. When I first saw it, I didn't appreciate it, as expecting action, whatever. When I saw it six years and more accepting of movies and story, my whole view of the film changed. I choose this over Red Dragon any day, and I reckon a lot of other will too, if they haven't seen this. Take my advice. See it. This one has much more suited actors, and is more scary and bloody suspenseful. William Petersen is tailor made for this role, truly showing a guy, torn and scarred, slowly recovering day by day, from Lectors attack, that fateful night, after din din, which didn't only leave physical scars. An array of affected emotions is where Norton vastly lacked in showing us. From the very first frame, Petersen's performance has us. He reluctantly, though out of guilt, if feeling morally obliged to the victims, accepts the case to track down the tooth fairy, who's selecting families as victims for his sick and repressed sexual fantasies. Brian Cox's Lector is different, from Hopkin's where I still think Tony's better, but Cox is chillingly riveting, showing just what this great and versatile actor was capable of in his heyday, and still is. The others are also great, the tooth fairy killer, Dollarhyde, will made the hairs on your wrists stand up literally, while the blind woman is very strong too who could be the psycho's next victim, unless hot shot tracking expert, Will Graham (Petersen) has anything to say about it. The great character actor, Stephen Lang is at his scummy best, as a low life reporter, who gets his just desserts. The music rocks, a little unnerving when played to the tense scenes, affecting when played against the sad ones, and there are a few scores, all of which I liked. This excellent movie's a serial killer's smorgasboard, scarring unforgettable moments, triggered from writing this. If a lover of SOTL or Hannibal, and.... Red Dragon, the remake of this, you'll be totally absorbed by this, where the movie choosing more story over action, where too here, we get to know Graham's family more. The music works beautifully against the story but that's a trademark of Mann's films. The climax is smashingly terrific would say, while the whole movie is filmed to A1 perfection. The movie almost has a flawlessness to it. Violence is moderate in quota, and one feels this quota restrained, though some images are pretty strong, and like the others, this film is definitely not for the disturbed where this made four years, prior to Silence Of The Lambs, doesn't change that fact.",Manhunter

52,FiendishDramaturgy,Red Dragon was way way better.,3,13 January 2004,"As the much-touted initial installment of the ""Hannbal Lecter"" series, this movie really did not impress me. Again, I stand against the flow of the mighty river that is public opinion, but I felt the portrayal by Cox as ""Leckter"" was shallow, superficial, and otherwise lacked the intensity generated by Anthony Hopkins.The part of Graham was also better portrayed in the Red Dragon remake. While it was well played here, it was much better done in Red Dragon, as it created an electrifying feeling, and generated that wonderful suspense I had come to expect from these movies, and did not get...with this one.Also, there is present, one of the most horribly distracting musical scores in the history of theater, aside from 2001: A Spade Odyssey. The worst case for music and its affects on an audience, play out well here. This was horrid, and succeeded in killing whatever mood the scene had managed to achieve.For this movie to be so highly praised by horror fans, I was sorely disappointed. While the scenes and dialog play out pretty much exactly as they did in Red Dragon, this production was by far, inferior to the remake. The sets were poorly and cheaply designed, the performances were sub-par to what I experienced with the remake, and the story (while compelling) moved along far too slowly for my taste. There are times when a slow-moving story can generate that wonderful level of suspense, create an air of mystery and tension which is so needed in these movies of the psychological sub-genre. This attempt failed to create much of anything with its slow build-up for me, besides boredom with the whole first half of the movie, and frankly, by the time I muddled through the first uneventful portion, I really did not care wither or not they caught the ""Tooth Fairy,"" killed Graham and his family, or succeeded.If you are a horror fan, see this movie. It is, after all, the movie which spawned Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal, and the prequel remake Red Dragon. But that is, honestly, the only reason to see it. It is dated, slow and rather a ""B"" production all around.This rates a 5.4/10 on the ""B"" scale.That's a 3.1/10 on the ""A"" scale, from...the Fiend :.",Manhunter
53,generationofswine,An Honest Review,9,25 November 2016,"The focus in this film is wonderful.Movies like this often shine the spotlight on the killer. Hannibal Lecter is the star, Ted Bundy is the star, whatever killer the movie is about tends to be the star of the film.It means you are watching roughly the same movie over and over again, and, what's worse is the killer really has the easy job.Manhunter focuses on the real hero, it focuses on the person that has to hunt down the killer. It makes for one heck of an entertaining movie and one you don't often see. January Man is really the only other prominent movie like this that comes to mind.The difference, however, at least what sets Manhunter apart is that it really gives the audience the sense that, yes, the good guys have the daunting task of finding a needle in a haystack and that really ups the tension. You get the sense that they have to find one person out of millions before he kills again.Because of that it's moody and wonderful to watch, it does a better job of creating the tension, the sense of over-whelming difficulty the good guys have to face than the more killer focused Red Dragon could ever do.",Manhunter
54,freemantle_uk,Above Average Thriller,8,10 February 2009,"When watching Manhunter I was a little underwhelmed, I was hoping for more. Saying that it is above average and a solid serial killer/cop thriller.Manhunter was based on the book Red Dragon by Thomas Harris, the first film about Hannibal Lector. and led to the films of Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal, Red Dragon (a remake) and Hannibal Rising. This was Michael Mann's baby-steps into theatrical film making after television work, and led he to direct excellent films like The Last of the Mohians, Heat, the Insider and Collectial.The plot of film was Will Graham (William Petersen), an expert profiler, who is called out of retired by the FBI to investigate a serial killer, the Tooth Fairy, who had brutally murdered two families in the Deep South of America. Graham is reluctant at first but he scene of duty makes him get involved with the case. After some early success, the case becomes stuck and the intelligence serial killer Hannibal Leckter (Brain Cox) is enlisted to help. Things take a further twist when the the Tooth Fairy starts to communicate with Leckter and the FBI investigation becomes a race against time because the Tooth Fairy kills his victims on the full moon.The acting is top-notch. I thought William Petersen was better suited to the role of Will Graham then Ed Norton was. Brain Cox was chilling as Hannibal and did do well in the role, and overall I think Cox is a better actor then Anthony Hopkins. Other good actors were involved in this film, such as Joan Allen, Tom Noonan and Dennis Farina. The tone of the film was more understated then the other entries in the series, and realistic in performances. You get to see the psychological battle within Graham, but I thought the dream scene wasn't needed. Michael Mann also shows that he is a good set-piece director, to gun battle, to the attempted police set-up and the torture scene of a reporter. Some other aspects I like was you didn't get to see the Tooth Fairy until the middle of the film and you done get to see what drives him or even much about him. Compared to Red Dragon their is a scene when you hear the Tooth Fairy getting psychologically tortured by his guardian when he is doing weight and that felt clichéd. Also in Manhunter, it attempts to humanize the villain and show he was intelligence; like a serial killer in real life you most possibly wouldn't know of what he gets up to. However, watching the film, it felt a little heartless and therefore you lose some of the feelings of engagement with the characters and the events. Also, the soundtrack was awful.Grade: B-",Manhunter
55,JoeB131,Judge the film on its own merits,7,27 November 2010,"The thing about this film is that it contains characters, notably Hannibal Lecter, before they became household names. In ""Red Dragon"", Lector is a minor character (it's even spelled ""Lecktor"" here, and he only has about three scenes in the movie, and they are effective enough, because he's not the key character.) Obviously, the character was expanded in ""Silence of the Lambs"" and its sequel ""Hannibal"", prequels, ""Red Dragon"" (based on the same source novel) and ""Hannibal Rising"" so people watching this film wanting more Hannibal, and wanting Anthony Hopkins to play him.Watch this movie pretending none of those other films ever existed, and that Hopkins never played the role, and you'll enjoy the film.William Peterson (who later went on playing a very similar character in ""CSI"") delivers as a profiler who gets too close to his work, just getting burned by the insanity he has to try to comprehend without being swallowed up by it. Dennis Farina (Law and Order, amongst other things) plays Jack Crawford, an FBI agent who balances his friend's sanity versus the need to stop a maniac. These are the important characters in the film, and it's about them. The remake ""Red Dragon"" shoe-horns Lector into the film where he doesn't need to be, really.The scenes with the Dollarhyde character are truly uncomfortable to watch, which is the point, I guess, particularly when he seduces the blind girl and then wants to kill her in a jealous rage. It's very effective.Okay, we have to look at it, Brian Cox as ""Hannibal Lecktor"", not to be confused with ""Hannibal Lecter"", played by Sir Anthony Hopkins and having become a pop-culture icon. Cox is very effective. His ""Lecktor"" is not possessed of super-human powers. He's just a very clever psychopath. He's effective for his role in the plot, compared to the way he gets portrayed in the sequels and prequels and remake.In short, check your preconceptions at the door, and you'll enjoy this film.",Manhunter

Brian Cox is first in line to tackle Lecter, but seems misdirected. He comes off as just some guy in a cell, not the overwhelming, absurdly intimidating presence he is in the book or, later, in the expert hands of Anthony Hopkins or Mads Mikkelsen. That's not the only bit of directorial blunder. In fact, given the amount of star power involved in the film and the gripping power of the source material, it's a major surprise that it's all so blunt, dull and empty. William Peterson (of later CSI fame) leads the show as Will Graham - bland, erratic and prone to nearly-comical mood swings - with a similarly underwhelming effort from character actor Dennis Farina as his supervisor, Jack Crawford. And it's not like the director is some hack. Michael Mann is typically very good behind the camera, but in this case he's just completely missed the mark. There's no underlying tension to the proceedings, none of the complicated character arcs that made the original tale so engrossing. Francis Dollarhyde, the fascinating maniac behind the string of murders driving it all, is cut off at the knees thanks to a criminal lack of exploration. His famous full-torso tattoo is left glaringly off-screen, the false teeth that become his trademark converted into a rudimentary, totally unexplained, side prop. As he falls, so does the film. Despite the two-hour running time, it seems shallow and incomplete, rushed to an unsatisfying new ending that's painfully generic.

57,Lechuguilla,Split Script,6,11 February 2013,"A very serious, and conveniently photogenic, FBI man named Will Graham (William Petersen) takes a personal interest in catching a serial killer. It's an average thriller.The first half is quite good as Graham, recovering from psychological trauma of a previous case, learns about the current killer, called the ""tooth fairy""; consults with other cops; and gathers forensic evidence. He interviews Hannibal Lecktor (Brian Cox) in prison, to see if Lecktor can help him psychoanalyze the tooth fairy. There is a subtle sense of alienation about all the characters, trapped in their urban environments. Glass and windows play into this motif.Unfortunately, the second half is terrible. It's like it was written by an amateur scriptwriter. While the first half focuses on Graham, the second half alternates between Graham and the tooth fairy, presenting a choppy, back-and-forth plot structure. Further, the killer is introduced too abruptly, and scenes generally lack effective transitions.We never learn much about the killer's motivation. The ""lunar cycle"" theme is not explained, nor are we given much explanation about the ""red dragon"". Various geographic locations seem arbitrary. The appearance of the killer, especially when he's first introduced, is laughable. And the film's ending is preposterous and silly.The film has a distinctive 1980s look and feel, with its fashions, slow-motion camera shots, and music track. Except for the killer, casting is acceptable. Acting ranges from acceptable to below average. Joan Allen gives a really nice performance.If the second half had maintained the quality of the first half, this film would have been quite good. As is, ""Manhunter"" is an average cop movie, wherein the villain is a kind of stereotyped, and rather typical, bogeyman.",Manhunter
58,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Chilling atmospherics and wicked performances,9,18 September 2015,"I'm honestly ashamed that I hadn't seen Michael Mann's Manhunter, at least entirely, before tonight. When I was younger I was enamoured with Jonathan Demme's taut, frazzling Silence Of The Lambs, intrigued by Ridley Scott's bizarre, velvety, comical Hannibal and very underwhelmed by Brett Ratner's Red Dragon. Then, recently I've been singing the praises of NBC's crack at the Lecter mythos, which has been nothing short of mind blowing. But I never thought to go back and revisit this sleek, moody genesis of the tale, and damn am I glad I did. Mann, one of my all time top directors, gives his usual class to this macabre procedural, feeding surreal, almost paranormal vitality into a story which could easily go the clinical route of pedestrian thriller. William L. Peterson is minimalist glory as the profiler who goes a bit too deep into the minds of serial killers, Will Graham. It's the best work I've ever seen him do, and both Mann and him let the character organically percolate into some scenes of rare maturity among Hollywood fare, for instance explaining to his intuitive son in a supermarket just what his job entails, in explicit detail, and that there are monsters out there that have to be dealt with, not sugar coating the horror for his son. He's called by Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina, deliberate, down to earth, my new favourite incarnation of the classic character) head of the behavioural unit at the FBI, who needs Will's specific skill set to capture an elusive killer called the Tooth Fairy (Tom Noonan, using his ghostly appearance and unassuming, soft voice to work wonders of creeping, contemplative dread), who is slaughtering families in their beds. Will consults the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lektor, here played by Brian Cox. While Anthony Hopkins took the theatrical route, and Mads Mikkelsen the abstract, esoteric approach, Cox grounds the good doctor in a jovial state of good natured charm, with brief, unnerving glimpses at the beast beneath. Because in this film we never actually see Hannibal outside his jail cell, let alone committing any of his notorious atrocities, it makes the character, and Cox's performance all the more effective. The fear of apprehension is worse than knowing exactly what it is we are afraid of. Joan Allen is great as a blind girl who unwittingly finds herself in The Tooth Fairy's clutches, and Kim Griest must be commended for her work as Will's wife, a thanklessly written role that she skillfully brings to new heights, turning the few scenes that her and Petersen share into pure cathartic gold. The film clocks in at a streamlined two hours, with the fat trimmed and not a moment wasted on anything but the sheer breathtaking atmosphere of the story. Mann, who clearly was getting homesick for the dulcet tones of his go to composers Tangerine Dream, employs the next best thing, in this case The Reds, radiating an ambient soundtrack of pure malice and suspenseful, synth drenched beauty that encapsulates the mood perfectly. I must say that even after NBC's recent booming success with Thomas Harris's source material, I feel like this is the finest manifestation of his work I've seen put to film as of yet. Just don't hate me for taking so long to finally see it lol.",Manhunter

As the film was directed by Michael Mann, it has a cool sensuality and style that seems perfectly appropriate for the subject matter.Will Graham (Petersen) trails serial killers by immersing himself in their mindset. He's already put Lecktor (Brian Cox) behind bars and is using him as a type of ""consultant"" in his search for a new killer, ""The Tooth Fairy"" (Tom Noonan). But being the smart, sharp tack that he is, Lecktor is also using Graham for his own nefarious purposes.""Manhunter"", shot by Dante Spinotti and designed by Mel Bourne, has a unique Euro/Miami vibe and is enriched by a great electronic and contemporary score by artists as diverse as Kitaro and Klaus Schulze. Will Graham's pursuit of The Tooth Fairy is visually compelling and a fascinating study of forensic procedure and one's man's professional and personal obsession.Dennis Farina's TV and movie career exploded due to his superb performance as Grahmam's FBI boss Jack Crawford, as did Petersen's. Tom Noonan is a revelation as The Tooth Fairy (Francis Dollarhyde) and brings amazing depth to his psychotic but tragic character.Brian Cox, in my opinion, is the scariest Lecktor, an anal retentive intellectual who spends the entire film behind bars, but never permits us to feel safe around him.The violent conclusion, where agents raid Dollarhyde's house, is spectacular but flawed, and appears to reflect post-production problems. Some shots don't cut properly and the use of optical slow motion feels more like a band-aid than one of director Mann's stylistic choices. The film's prologue is atmospheric and creepy, and the short scenes of Petersen with his son (on the beach) and wife (in bed) are beautifully shot and scored.The film is less a horrific experience (like ""Silence of the Lambs"") than a dark, sensual odyssey into the mind of a very disturbed individual, one of many who lurk amongst us.",Manhunter

The ""Dragon"" is played by Tom Noonan, who is very believable and ominous in this role.The set is based initially in the Florida Keys and we have atmospheric music from Michael Mann. William L. Petersen is the ""profiler"", and needs to work with Dr. Hannibal Lecter to discover the motivations of the more recent culprit; the Red Dragon. He watches his prey, somehow, and fantasizes about the methods of murder he may use. His identity is a question mark, until we get further into the film, which adds suspense.Joan Allen is very good in an early role, as a friend to Francis Dolarhyde, who was born with a cleft palate and several other handicaps. As she is blind, she does not discriminate against Dolarhyde as most others would. In the book, Thomas Harris delineated Dolarhyde's childhood a bit more, and perhaps a few of these flashbacks could have been inserted for added interest.Steven Lang as Freddie Lounds (a despicable magazine gossip reporter) is appropriately detestable, and is also ill-fated when he crosses the infamous Red Dragon.With a few missing details, this film was rather close to the book, but you must read the book to get the full effect. You will definitely enjoy it. Thomas Harris has a brilliant way of keying into characters, and manifesting their pathology in strange and unique story-lines. 8/10",Manhunter
64,aidanratesmovies,Not a fan,4,15 October 2020,"Well acted, and with an interesting premise, Manhunter is ultimately weighed down by its shallow approach to its source material- as well as its incredibly dull take and execution on such a peculiar and interesting mystery. This film is largely recognized as the first appearance of Hannibal Lecter, who is portrayed by Brian Cox in this film. Unfortunately for any fans of Silence of the Lambs or just Hannibal in general, you will most likely end up being disappointed. I have never seen Silence of the Lambs, as I wanted to experience this film with a fresh perspective, but sadly I wasn't very impressed. This film is incredibly dull. It has some good performances scattered throughout, but the way it tells its story is so incredibly dull, it makes the film quite a bore to watch. It's such a shame to see such potential go to waste, especially with such great talent involved. I enjoyed William Petersen's performance in the lead role as Will Graham, as well as Tom Noonan as the ""Tooth Fairy,"" and even Brian Cox as Lector (not that there is much of him to see). In the end, Manhunter is a disappointing mystery flick with a huge loss of potential and waste of talent. It's a peculiar take on crime mysteries, and serial killers in general, but sadly it doesn't make anything significant of it, and ends up being a rather forgettable thriller.
My Rating: 4.5/10",Manhunter
65,Agent10,The best of the Lector movies,8,23 July 2002,"With Red Dragon coming out fairly soon, I feel I should help defend the original film. Sure, Anthony Hopkins wasn't in the film, but who cares. With a fairly small budget and a bunch of no-name actors (even to this day, except for Joan Allen), this film helped create a character more sinister than Hannibal. The villain was so graciously portrayed by the underrated Tom Noonan, was more evil and hateful than Lector, and unfortunately, this role will most likely change in the upcoming `Red Dragon.' Even Brian Cox gave a great performance as Hannibal Lector. Sure, Red Dragon will be darker and better financed, but the true believers of the series know Manhunter will still be the better film simply because it didn't rely on a gimmick (like Red Dragon and Hannibal). Nonetheless, I felt this film was well made, even if it did feel like an extended television show (which was Michael Mann's day job at the time). Hopefully, the original will still outlast the lavishness the new version is promising.",Manhunter
66,ShootingShark,"Riveting, Crackerjack, Ultra-Stylish Crime Picture About The Ultimate Burnt-Out Cop",8,19 July 2007,"Will Graham is a retired fed with emotional problems following the traumatic case of a serial killer called Hannibal Lecktor. He is persuaded to help find another horrific killer on the proviso that he is not directly involved. But before long his obsession with the work overtakes him, clouding his judgement and endangering his family ...Michael ""The Man"" Mann's Manhunter is my favourite of the many excellent films by this great director. He adapted it from a great novel (Red Dragon, by Thomas Harris) and it was funded independently by Dino DeLaurentiis, allowing him an artistic and editorial freedom which he exploits to the hilt. It's probably the definitive eighties stylish crime picture, with achingly beautiful photography by Dante Spinotti, and ultra-intense synth-and-snare-drum music by Michel Rubini. The style is excessive for sure (when this cop has a hunch, they scramble a Learjet in five minutes to follow it up) - Will's family is impossibly perfect, the killer's artistic egocentrism is ludicrously pretentious and Farina's character seems to control more resources than a modest-sized country, but it's just so damn cool it doesn't matter. I like movies that take fantastic subjects and treat them with banality (e.g. Dark Star or Time Bandits), but this one does the reverse, creating a hyper-reality to each frame; every furrow in Petersen's brow becomes an exhausting emotional moment. The style suffuses even the conventional moments, like the bit in the motel room when Will literally jumps up and has a Eureka moment - in any other movie it would be silly, but here it is entrancing. Mann's seamless direction extends to the cast - Petersen and Farina epitomise his macho intelligence, Noonan is riveting as the giant, impenetrable killer, Allen is terrific as the blind girlfriend and Cox is suitably creepy as the haunting spectre of the previous case - all five performances are outstanding. Petersen is of course very famous now as the cop in the TV-show C.S.I., but his character here is almost an action blueprint for that, evidenced by the scene where he visits the crime scene and tapes his thoughts. The movie keeps coming up with original scenes (the infra-red imaging of the note, the stakeout in the backyard, the tiger at the dentist). It also explores its twisted killer as something more than just a psychopath which makes it much more tragic and compelling, and is something its many imitators have failed to recreate. This is of course the original Hannibal Lecter flick (the film misspells his name from the book as Lecktor), followed by Jonathan Demme's Silence Of The Lambs, Ridley Scott's Hannibal, and the odd French prequel Hannibal Rising, and unnecessarily remade (as Red Dragon) in 2002 with Anthony Hopkins playing Lecter. The others are all good movies, but none are as good, or as unconventional as this one. A point to note - occasionally movies make minor continuity gaffes, but surprisingly in this - a film which is designed perfection - there is a real howler in one scene which takes place in a supermarket. It's nice to know even geniuses are human.",Manhunter
67,valleyjohn,Highly regarded,7,25 February 2021,"I think people look back at Manhunter with a lot of nostalgia. I had someone say to me yesterday that it's the best film that features Hannibal Lecktor.
That's so wrong .
It's not even the third best film that features him in my opinion but it definitely has its memorable moments and I can see why it's so well liked .This is the story of Former F.B.I. profiler Will Graham who returns to service to pursue a deranged serial killer named ""the Tooth Fairy"" by the media.What surprised me was that there is only six years from the release of Manhunter and Silence of the Lambs.
I always though there was a much longer gap between films and watching Manhunter , i looks so dated , you would certainly think it's at least fifteen years older .What I like about this is that it's all about getting into the mind of the killer .
Will Graham had already suffered mental health issues doing the same thing previously but he's willing to go through it again to save another family .
The problem I have is that the threat to the family never actually materialises because the Tooth Fairy sets his sights on a blind woman instead , which seems an odd turn of events.Brian Cox is good as Hannibal Lecktar but doesn't have anywhere near as much menace as the Anthony Hopkins version but you can't blame him for that , seeing as this was made before that brilliant incarnation.Manhunter is a decent film but I'm not buying that it's better than the films that followed , because it's not , but you have to be extremely grateful that if it wasn't for this , then we'd probably never have seen Silence Of The Lambs , Hannibal & Red Dragon .",Manhunter

70,Galina_movie_fan,Moment of Truth,10,3 November 2006,"""Manhunter"" (1986) directed by Michael Mann - is a masterpiece, pure and simple. It took me five times but I finally realized it. I see it as the best adaptation of the favorite book written on the subject of serial killers and investigation of their crimes. I also discovered William Blake and his fascinating art, including the painting which gave the book its title, ""Red Dragon"", thanks to Mr. Harris. Michael Mann certainly read the book ""Red Dragon"" before he started to work on the movie and he was able to get inside of it as well as the book's main character, Will Graham was able to get inside a murderer's mind. The scene where Will Graham (William Peterson) finds out who the killer is makes me shiver every time I watch the movie. I can not recall another ""moment of truth"" as powerful and convincing as this one. It is more powerful that the similar scene in ""The Sound Of The Lambs"" where Clarise Starling figures out who and where the ""Buffalo Bill"" can be. Michael Mann took his time understanding how important the scene was and it received a royal treatment in the movie. I used to be disappointed that Mann cut the book's very impressive ending but after many viewings I think I understand why he did it. For me, the whole movie was a build up for the ""moment of truth"" scene and after Graham figured who the murderer was making us the participants of the process, it did not really matter (at least for me) how they were going to catch Francis ""Red Dragon"" Dolarhyde.",Manhunter
71,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,"A crime movie that has a good story, just misses on thrills",8,11 April 2021,"Crime and cop movies have been around for a long time. The idea of seeing the authorities catch their perp before they commit their next act is always something people want. Of course most people would expect the criminal to be a simple one. It's when that criminal is more slippery and hard to understand, that it begins to get tough and super stressful. While this particular film did not get many awards or nominations, it is still considered a decent crime film thanks to the material it was based on and the people involved. This was also the third film for director Michael Mann who would later direct The Last of the Mohicans (1992), Heat (1995), Ali (2001) and Public Enemies (2009). Blackhat (2015) is also under his name but let's forget that one. The only thing is here, for a thriller it doesn't do much of that, which is kind of surprising.Based on the book ""Red Dragon"" by Thomas Harris, with a screenplay written by Michael Mann, the story follows William Graham (William Petersen) a former F. B. I. Agent being reeled back in to help solve a crime no one seems to understand. Hoping to make it his final time since his last encounter was with the traumatizing Hannibal Lecktor (Brian Cox), Graham agrees to help with his friend Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina) leading the case. Another reason why Graham will not take another assignment after this one is because he has a wife Molly (Kim Greist) and son Kevin (David Seaman) he'd rather not endanger. The killer who's being nicknamed the ""Tooth Fairy"" (Tom Noonan) so far has been getting away with his killings without leaving a trace. Noonan would not long after this role be known as Cain in RoboCop 2 (1990).Believe it or not though, this film displays many familiar faces on screen before they created their signature characters. William Petersen is best known now as Gill Grissom from the original CSI: Crime Scene Investigation show. Brian Cox has been in all kinds of popular movies like X-2: X-Men United (2003) Trick 'r Treat (2007), Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) and R. E. D. (2010). Joan Allen who plays a film developer assistant in the movie would be in the The Bourne Supremacy (2004). A very young Stephen Lang appears too but would get noticed more in Gods and Generals (2003), Avatar (2009) and Don't Breathe (2016). There's Dan Butler known for voicing Mr. Simmons in Nickelodeon's Hey Arnold! Paul Perri who plays a friend of the main character Will would have a shining moment in Demolition Man (1993).There's the girl technician from RoboCop 2 (1990), a young Chris Elliot, that one guy who became a thing in John Carpenter's The Thing (1982) and even David Allen Brooks aka Agent Manners from Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman (2000), who's featured only in an archive video. As for performances go, the actors all do great jobs. William Petersen truly plays his character like a guy who doesn't want to get involved again but is still determined to catch the killer. Tom Noonan as the ""Tooth Fairy"" shows even before being in RoboCop 2 (1990) he knew how to act like a mentally unhinged person. Lastly who gets the least screen time but relishes every moment is Brian Cox as Lecktor. Cox plays it smooth but sneaky all the same. It's an underrated performance considering who would play the character later on.For cinematography, Dante Spinotti handled the camerawork for this picture. Right from the start viewers should be able to easily enjoy Spinotti's skill. Because of the wide shots, the camera captures much of the surrounding areas that the story takes place in. Spinotti also later shot for Hudson Hawk (1991), Heat (1995), L. A. Confidential (1997), X-Men: The Last Stand (2006), Hercules (2014) and Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018). Lastly the music composed by Michel Rubini and The Reds had an interesting sound. Amazingly there is a theme for Graham and the music works for the film. Whether it's memorable or not is debatable. The music is definitely a sound from the time, but the soundtrack does have other moments that stand out featuring other artists like Shriekback, The Prime Movers and Iron Butterfly.As the start to making of the Hannibal films, this crime thriller has everything but the thrills. This doesn't make it bad as a good cop film can entertain without it. But it does feel like something's missing. The acting is exceptional, the story works well, the camerawork is effective and the music is appropriate for the time.",Manhunter

Michael Mann is one; Peter Weir and Terrence Malick are the other notables in this league. Mann uses good music here but the choice of Iron Butterfly's In a Gadda da Vida in the crucial scene in Manhunter was smart. Mann's music choices in Heat, Violent Streets (Thief) , and The Last of the Mohicans are other examples of his acute aural talent. He enhances his films with his soundtrack management and choices.

73,winner55,Disturbing without ever patronizing,9,7 August 2007,"One of the central problems of the Hannibal Lecter series as it was revamped for the '90s and beyond became apparent to me when I heard one of the producers remark on the DVD of ""Hannibal Rising"" that they wanted to bring ""new blood to the franchise"". Beyond the tasteless quasi-pun, the real problem surfaced as a question: how do you turn sadistic serial murders into a profit-making ""franchise""? There was a time when writers made serial narratives concerning infamous villains - i.e., e.g., Fu Manchu or Dracula - because there was something unexplored about the villains particular genius for committing evil and escaping that had not yet been completely explored in the first entry of the series; interestingly, Bram Stoker wrote only the one Dracula novel, which explored the character exhaustively; when that character arrived in Hollywood, his first appearance was an extreme truncation of the original novel, thus leaving plenty opportunity for further exploration of the character in film.So the problem the producers of ""Hannibal Rising"" raise is, has the character been exhaustively studied or not? Because if he has, additional sequels are a waste of time.And having witnessed ""Hannibal Rising"", I confess I believe the character exhausted; but that's another review.Here, let me just say that it was good to see Mann's film again recently, to return to the series' cinematic origins, to get a clearer perspective of the Lecter character as he was originally conceived.What makes the Lecter character fascinating in ""Manhunter"" is that he is pure genius become pure sociopath. This is a character who first committed murder just to see what it was like, not out of any sense of outrage or revenge. The most important line in the film is when Lecter remarks to the FBI profiler, ""if you do what god does often enough, you become god"" (assuming that what god does most often is kill people). While the character of the practicing serial killer, the Tooth Fairy, is rich in unresolved and unresolvable sexual tensions, this line from Lecter describes the real ground both he and the Tooth Fairy walk, a march towards some assumed omnipotence that requires murder as its ultimate manifestation.what's disturbing about this wish for god-hood is that we all either feel it or at least the temptation of it pulling at us at some time. Like the profiler in the film, we aren't really sure we have a real defense against Lecter's claim that he and we ""are alike"".Mann's success in this film is his ability to recognize the seriousness of these issues while still constructing a rock-solid police procedural around them. Unlike the later series, there's nothing romantic about this film, although there are certainly thrilling set-pieces sprinkled through-out. I notice that some of the reviewers critical of the film remark the naturalistic, low-key atmosphere of the film as (severely critical) ""slow"" or as (apologetically lightly critical) ""low-budget"". Actually, Mann has all the resources with which to make his film, and he moves it along at a pace that is thoughtful while allowing sudden interjections of rapid action sequences. This is what Mann does best, this is why anyone would hire him to direct a film, this is why his fans pay to see his films. This is a thinking adult's director, not a splashy flash-in-the-pan wannabe.I don't know if I will ever see the other Lecter films again in 10 years; but I've seen ""Manhunter"" once a decade so far, and it remains wholly satisfying - albeit in a disturbing way, of course, given its subject. But I have a suspicion I will like it just as much 10 years from now, when I see it again.By the way, I prefer the 'director's cut' (which rates a 'ten').",Manhunter
74,brando647,A Decent Psychological Thriller with 80's Flair,5,16 September 2008,"There are apparently a lot of people out there who feel Michael Mann's 1986 thriller, based on a book by Thomas Harris, is an under-rated gem. I'm not one of those people. It's not a bad film, but it never really made much of an impression on me and I find myself having a hard time sitting through the whole film sometimes. William Petersen stars as retiring FBI Agent Will Graham, who returns to his job for one last case. A serial killer on a lunar cycle is killing entire families in grisly fashion and the FBI has no leads on the psychopath, and Will Graham (the man who caught Hannibal Lecktor) is the only one who can enter his mind-frame and stop him before the next full moon.One aspect of Mann's film that catches me off guard every time I watch it is the blatant 1980's flair accompanying it. There were a lot of films from that decade that you can watch and they are somewhat timeless; this film slaps you in the face with it's 80's style. From the bright neon green opening titles to the 80's rock soundtrack swallowing some scenes, there is no forgetting what era this film is from. For the best example of all this, rewatch the final confrontation at the end of the film: the use of Iron Butterfly and the strange neon purple dawn feel like something from an 80's music video.The movie did have it's highlights, mostly from the cast. While Anthony Hopkins will always be THE Hannibal Lecktor in my eyes, Brian Cox did a fantastic job as the first person to play the character. He had the same eerie sense of menace and evil as Hopkins would years later. Tom Noonan was great as psychopath Francis Dollarhyde. I didn't think he was as good as Ralph Fiennes in the 2002 version of the film, but I still enjoyed his performance as the disturbed antagonist. I should also give an honorable mention to Dennis Farina, whose performance I enjoyed in his role as Jack Crawford (Graham's superior in the FBI).The first Lecktor story has never been my favorite of the series, but it's not the worst either (that dishonor goes to the 2007 prequel fiasco). I enjoyed the novel and, while this movie takes quite a few liberties with the storyline, it manages to say true for the most part. I wish they have delved into Dollarhyde's back-story as was done in the book, giving the audience a better understanding of what created the monster; I also felt the Reba McClane plot was rushed during the final act. We get some good performances from the cast and a visual style that feels like an LSD flashback at times. It's a good addition to the Lecktor series but certainly not the best.",Manhunter

So what went wrong at the box office for this film? I don't know: because it was great and there weren't too many issues with the pacing or cinematography or casting: though the music feels really dated at times. Still that's not enough to sink a film's prospects at the theatres.My guess is that MGM and De Laurentiis didn't know how to market the film in a way that made it a viable project to the average cinema-goer in the mid-80s: something that wouldn't be resolved until Silence of the Lambs came out in 1991 and took the world (as well as the Oscars) by storm. Manhunter wasn't a horror film like 'Lambs' was: but though it still had genuine scary moments it was more a psychological thriller with neo-noir undertones and brooding. Honestly: Manhunter proves itself to be a more-than-fitting introduction to the world of Hannibal. And I'm glad this film's been reappraised since it came out in 1986.Manhunter is a good film that came out at the wrong time I guess: even then it's still a genuinely good piece of cinema give-or-take The Silence of The Lambs factor. Oh: and yes, this film's BETTER than Red Dragon (this film's later 'Lambs' canonical re-adaptation of the same book).For Hannibal fans out there this is a crucial slice of history that shouldn't be missed.

The array of methods (mostly related to forensic evidence) used by the team of police personnel to identify and track down the killer were simply ingenious. You stayed true to the book and incorporated nearly all of Thomas Harris' ideas. Manhunter's status as a police procedural is punctuated by the fact that you paid a lot of attention to the sets - the police meetings are all located in places characterized by an almost sterile white corporate cleanliness. They are notably different from the sets used during the other scenes. Manhunter is also a really scary horror film. It has one of the creepiest beginnings ever with the grainy point of view shot of the killer as he flashes a light upon a sleeping couple. The scenes inside Dollarhyde's abode were genuinely frightening. It offers more than a glance into the motivations of a serial killer. William Petersen is perfectly cast as a tortured cop struggling with his inner demons. I loved the use of slow motion in the two action scenes. You channeled a bit of De Palma in the scene where Dollarhyde gazes upon his lover and another man. It was a really deft touch. A lot of people complain about the background score. But I thought it was excellent and added another dimension to this film. The film looks gorgeous on Blu Ray. Great job, Michael. Best Regards, Pimpin. (9/10)",Manhunter

83,hnt_dnl,Best film of 1986... a supercool thriller by Michael Mann,10,6 April 2008,"MANHUNTER came out in 1986, around the time of the TV show Miami Vice craze. And there's an obvious reason: the same man that created VICE also directed MANHUNTER...Michael Mann! The VICE touches are evident in MANHUNTER: very bright colors, regardless of setting, an uber-cool look, 80s music underscoring important scenes (yet, ironically, even today, the music seems appropriate for each scene and still adds to them rather than take away). But MANHUNTER is certainly not a VICE ripoff! It is the engrossing story of some severely disturbed, deeply wounded human beings. In the pre-credits, we get a point-of-view shot of a figure lurking inside a home up the stairs, then the wife awakens...roll credits...MANHUNTER begins! Opening scene, we are introduced to our hero, retired FBI profiler Will Graham (played brilliantly by William Peterson), who quit after being traumatized by his last capture of gruesome serial killer Hannibal Lecktor (played here in chilling form by Brian Cox). That's right, Brian Cox, not Anthony Hopkins! And although SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is the wider-known film, you'll still enjoy this film a lot and Cox's interpretation of Lecktor (the way it's spelled in this film). Graham is recruited by his old boss Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina in an extremely fine performance) to help nab the serial killer who killed the family of the opening credits, the Leeds family. The first half of the film focuses strictly on Graham, his inner demons, his quest to catch the killer and the convolution of these two things. Graham has the unenviable ability to go into the mind of his prey and outthink them at their own game.Then Mann does something brilliant. He dares to tell the story of the killer in the second half and his introduction is a smooth transition. The killer is named Francis Dollarhyde (Tom Noonan in a truly magnificent performance), a tall, hulking, yet immensely sensitive man. Dollarhyde's love interest, one of his co-workers, is a blind woman Reba McClane (played by Joan Allen in a very fresh, sexy, captivating performance). Reba is actually attracted to Dollarhyde and they have a rather touching courtship, a kind of beauty-and-the-beast relationship.The two separate, yet overlapping, stories collide to a very exciting climax as Graham and the cops close in on Dollarhyde, who has taken Reba hostage. This climax has an energetic pace and a rocking music score to go with it that I've always loved. MANHUNTER is also a great example of the police procedural and the thought and detail it takes to catch this killer. The cast is pure gold here: Petersen, Cox, Noonan, Allen, Farina. Additionally, Stephen Lang as a scumbag reporter and Kim Greist as Graham's wife are well cast. Watching Mann's recent masterpiece COLLATERAL actually reminded me of the brilliance of MANHUNTER: the atmospheric mood, stylistic look, and cool music mixed with complex characterizations and great pacing. I actually find MANHUNTER a much more watchable film than SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, which is so mired in slowness and horror, that it has a lot of dull moments and boring characters. But MANHUNTER, while very stylish in presentation, has a lot more working for it. It is filled with substantive detail, has a great premise, and contains great acting, esp. by Petersen, Noonan, and Cox. It is a very deliberate, intense film. They actually re-made MANHUNTER as RED DRAGON, which is an excruciatingly boring and unwatchable film...Trust me, MANHUNTER is the film to see!",Manhunter
84,Karl Self,Recommended,7,20 February 2001,"Before I start, I should state that I have seen Manhunter (Red Dragon) on video and dubbed, so it obviously wasn't a great cinematic experience.I think one's opinion of this movie depends on whether one has read the book and seen the ""sequels"" Silence Of The Lambs and Hannibal;  I saw SOTL first and then many times again, then H, then MH;  I have not read any of Thomas Harris' books.MH is a very accomplished and entertaining movie.  It has no gory scenes, no great special effects but great suspense.  Unlike SOTL it is less of a rollercoaster ride and more realistic (a dubious compliment for a fiction movie), especially in the portrayal of Hannibal Lecter (Lecktor).SOTL, IMHO, is even better, more of a classic, whereas H is utter tripe.  I will watch MH again, hopefully on the big screen and in original English.",Manhunter
85,Fernando-Rodrigues,Assassin Hunter,5,10 July 2021,"Its script was poorly written (it has lots of some action but almost no mystery, many characters were not well developed and misused, etc.), its too slow for a thriller, the performances weren't solid (they even seemed choreographed at some moments) and this moving is slow-paced to a point where it gets obnoxious... this movie might have cult status, but falls short at many moments.",Manhunter
86,sharky_55,"Three, four, five and six.",6,24 December 2015,"A hand-held POV opens Manhunter, and the serial killer known as the Tooth Fairy silently intrudes on his victim's home, climbs up the steps, pokes a harsh light at their sleeping body, and we know what happens next. It is as frighteningly effective as the night-vision sequence in the basement, or how Lecter and the countless male eyes hover over Clarice in the masterpiece Silence of the Lambs, the next in Thomas Harris' series. And then it steps into a different film, something quite drudging and overly serious and so unmistakeably 80s. In what is Mann's most stylistically distinct film, he creates a strict colour code that maps out our characters. For the brilliant profiler Graham and his wife he drenches the frame with a cool, romantic blue, which is an easy way of hiding just how shallow of a character she really is, and how little solace she actually provides to the man who could have easily become a killer himself. Elsewhere, Dollarhyde's remote home is lit overhead by this eerie green glow as if a UFO was endlessly hovering above, and for much of the police work and office and holding cells we have pure white - nothing grimy, nothing morally decadent, but it matches Brian Cox quite well. The entire building is even more impressive - the post-modern architecture of the Hugh Museum of Art in Atlanta, with its cavernous spirals, pristine walls and more glass windows than you could imagine.In Cox we have the most polite and affable version of Lecter, which has sparked endless debates on him vs Hopkins' performance. His supporters argue that it is precisely the veneer of authenticity and kindness that makes Cox so genuinely psychopathic and terrifying, but what good is it if there is no opposing force, no shattering of the mirror? Near the end of their conversation, Graham want to hear no more, and goes to leave, and the door conveniently does not open immediately, and he is forced to block out Lecter as he struggles to escape. He runs and runs and runs until he is outside, huffing and puffing with fear, and that is how he is captured candidly by Lounds (and that further ridicules the reaction). Lambs had no need to do this, to force emotional stress - Clarice was terrified, but all the same she could have left Lecter in that cell and never visited again, but she doesn't, and it is all the more intriguing, personal, and intense. Cox's Lecter provides no reason to fear or be swallowed up by his gaze, and brings nothing substantial to the film's narrative. What doesn't help is Petersen's performance, who takes each whispered and immersive comment profiling the killer to maximum profundity, and then adds second person perspective to milk very last drop of seriousness. In one moment, Petersen simply gazes at the camera in close-up, brooding endlessly, and the score hits overkill as it attempts to signal a moment of fear and retrospection. As if that wasn't enough, each scene is also heavily synthesized, painfully and overly so. It's as if the sound mixer had somehow been snubbed on the credit list, and to compensate they had turned the volume knob all the way up in every pivotal moment. It makes no attempt at subtlety, but blares and blares, drowning out everything else on the screen. One of the film's better moments is marked by the score's absence; the quiet, intimate, conversation between Graham and his son, where he attempts to explain the current situation, and does not resort to dumbing down or use of clumsy metaphor. A rare moment of triumph for the soundtrack has Shriekback's Coelocanth sync up perfectly with the booming heartbeats of a tranquillised tiger, and the way the flute repeats three notes immediately conjures up imagery of a powerful beast stalking its prey through an Eastern jungle. Dollarhyde feels drawn to that kind of natural power, but it is also an intensely intimate moment for the blind Reba, as she runs her fingers through the fur. We have been warned of the serial killer's intentions for the 'surprise', and yes there is surprise, but in a good way, and the anxiety we hold is blissfully replaced with a scene of such sensuality, a hundredfold more for someone who relies on hearing and touch. And so, they sleep together later that night. The film ends in the messiest climax of them all. A small consolation to this is something I liked; the way in which wife and son are remarkably safe and out of the picture, and it is not some life or death situation which forces the detective to take action, but his own increasing fears and troubles. But it is nigh impossible to sell the slow-motion jumping through glass moment. Mann had to shoot this with a skeleton crew and no special effects backing him up, and it shows; he switches up all the lights to obscure the packets of ketchup masquerading at blood, his edits jump erratically from profile to close-up with no regard for coherency or pacing, and in perhaps the weirdest decision of them all, he utilises jump cuts to show gunshots and flailing bodies drop again and again. Oh, and he tosses more slow-motion in there.",Manhunter
87,aciessi,"""Open your Eyes""",8,14 June 2015,"Welcome to the first incarnation of the Hannibal Lector cinematic franchise. It pales in comparison to The Silence of the Lambs, but Manhunter has incredible moments of it's own. The direction by Michael Mann is outstanding, and visceral. Every set piece is vividly colorful, and eerily dangerous. The cinematography is beautiful. The acting is top notch. The portrayal of the Tooth Fairy here is so terrifyingly done by Tom Noonan, who even looks like Ted Levine in Silence. I know, it's in the same universe, but the resemblance is scary. I also loved Joan Allen's performance as the blind woman, played absolutely so convincingly. I wasn't too crazy about Brian Cox as Hannibal Lector, because once you've seen Anthony Hopkins do him, you can't see anyone else doing him. After all, that's why they remade the film with Hopkins in 2002. Silence stole the thunder, but you need to see this first attempt at the source material. I was fascinated, and really creeped out.",Manhunter
88,KnightsofNi11,Creepy 80's fun,8,8 July 2011,"Watching the not so humble beginnings of the Hannibal Lecter legacy of terror is like watching a small child murder a puppy. It's horrific and you know where it is leading. Manhunter marks the very first appearance of Hannibal Lecter, only here he isn't played by Anthony Hopkins. Brian Cox plays the sly psychopath as he helps FBI Agent Will Graham to hunt down an elusive killer nicknamed ""The Tooth Fairy."" This gruesome murderer seems to pick his targets at random and Graham hopes that Lecter will be able to help pinpoint The Tooth Fairy's pattern. But you can't exactly trust a serial killer so Lecter causes even more problems for Graham, making his chase all the more thrilling and dangerous.I have a very keen interest in serial killer films so I was guaranteed to like this movie from the start. This is a step by step serial killer flick that also captures the dark depravity of the psychopathic mind spot on. It tells a thrilling and disturbing story from start to finish that builds suspense so well. The film isn't even told from just one perspective. At times we see the film from Graham's position as he hunts down the killer, trying desperately to get into his mind and decipher the killer's motives. Then a large portion of the movie is from the killer's point of view where we get to see the darkly twisted motives that drive this creature to insanity. It makes the film human on both ends of the spectrum while also building a narrative that flows and builds very well.But what's really fun about Manhunter is just how timely it is. This film doesn't try at all to convince you it wasn't made in the mid 1980's. It's got all the music and style that fits so well for that time period. A lot of it can be conceived as cheesy but I find it to be a lot of fun and give the film a wildly entertaining mood. Plus, I didn't find this film unsatisfactory in the thrill department. It manages to be very creepy and very suspenseful, even amidst some of the 80's cheese. The style of the film is very 80's but it's also very Michael Mann. Mann directs the film with a lot of haunting precision. It is a very well shot film that elicits fear and anguish pretty easily. Mann does a great job at creating a film that is both terrifying and interesting.Manhunter is a different film but it is very good. It is disturbing but in a more subtle and haunting way. You can complain about some of the 80's cheese all you want but this isn't a film that is completely submerged in the absurdity of 80's movies. It is a serial killer film done just right and with extremely creepy precision.",Manhunter
89,wkozak221,Best version.,10,23 November 2019,"I love this version. IMO it is the best. For several reasons: 1. I prefer William Petersen over Jodie Foster. Never liked her. 2. Michael Mann does a great job directing. 3. I like the spelling of Lecktor, as opposed to the other spelling. 3. You have Stephen Lang as a supporting actor. Does a great job. 4. Tom Noonan is an imposing actor. He makes a very convincing villain. 4. IMO Brian Cox does a great job in his portrayal. The way he portrays Lecktor he could be the unassuming next door neighbor.",Manhunter
90,stamper,Potentially good,5,8 January 2002,"This could have been a good film, really. It had great potential and a couple of really good actors, such as Dennis Farina and William Peterson, who did a great job. But the disadvantages were just too big. First of all, the villain sucked, no he SUCKED. He was so badly played, that words cannot actually describe it. Then there were some points in the story that were really stupid and the ending was dumb too. I mean, an intelligent killer like the Red Dragon, could never be that stupid right, plus what was that attempted last killing all about? I mean not that it was unbelievable that he could freak like that, but let him do it otherwise you know. Not just blow the guy away with nobody hearing it (even the blind person, who are supposed to have great hearing) and why drag the woman back to his place? Really stupid stuff. If Anthony Hopkins and Co. should ever consider making a third in the Lector series, be sure to check Red Dragon by Thomas Harris. It has a couple of great ideas, but you sure as hell would need a much better screenwriter than in this film. Great potential that is ruined by bad screenwriting at times and a bad, preposterous and not scary villain. Oh one more thing, be sure to call the film Red Dragon and not Manhunter.

91,ivo-cobra8,"Brilliant , underrated flick the best of William Petersen!",8,26 May 2016,"Manhunter is a lot of underrated brilliant thriller from Michael Mann who directed also Heat and Collateral. This is very underrated original film from Dr. Hannibal Lecktor. I prefer Red Dragon (2002) over this film. Red Dragon was the first film I saw and watching this film I realized something: the film suffers from it's problems: Brian Cox's character had less screen time on it in this film. I only saw three scenes of his character and by the end of the film he disappeared without any explanation. But that doesn't mean I don't like it, I like this film, I like it a lot and it is my third favorite film from Hannibal Lector films franchise. I don't care about Hannibal Rising. To me it is a useless prequel and I want watch TV series and I really don't care about it. William Petersen as Will Graham is awesome. This is the best performance of him, I have ever saw. William was the main cast in CSI (2000) as Gil Grissom but after he left and Ted Danson took over the show, I quit watching it. Gil Grissom will always be my favorite character.Tom Noonan scared me to death, his character was a real psychopath scary villain as Francis Dolarhyde ""The Tooth Fairy"". I seriously thought Ralph Fiennes had better acting performance, cause I got to know his character a bit more. In this movie I honestly had no clue why Tom Noonan was terrorizing family's. He was less in the film and he had less screen time, but even with less screening time, he was really scary. I prefer Antony Hopkins over Ronny Cox and I prefer Ralph Fiennes over Tom Noonan, that is just my opinion.Things I do like about this film: Director Michael Mann used a lot of music and theme music from Miami Vice. I read a review on IDMb from a user claiming, this was a Miami Vice style. Michael Mann was producer of Miami Vice so of course he used music from Miami Vice.The songs in this movie are all beautiful. After watching this movie, the song was playing when Tom Noonan woke up, beside Reba McClane (Joan Allen) my dad rushed to me and asked about the music who was the artist of this beautiful song. I answered I really don't know, because I don't know what song was played.I love William Petersen to death as Will Graham in here, his acting skill is glorious in this movie.You have nice shootouts on the end of the film: Serial killer Francis Dollarhyde (Tom Noonan) uses a pistol gripped Remington 870 at the end of the film. He kills 2 cops, wounds Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina) and attempts to kill Graham (William Petersen) before he pumps 6 rounds into him with his Bulldog (though before Dollarhyde was also wounded by another cop's bullet).Will kills Francis on the end of the film, he saves Reba (Joan Allen) from The Tooth Fairy and tells her that he's name is Will Graham.During shootouts you hear the song playing IN-A-GADDA-DA-VIDA played by Iron Butterfly, I love that song.I love the shootouts on the end of the film and Will saves a hostage Reba after he saw trough window how Francis is attempting to kill Reba, he runs towards him and jumps trough the window on Francis, but Francis is to strong he cuts him and he throws him in the fridge wounding him. This scene is awesome and I love it. How Will figure it out, the motive from Francis was brilliant, I think Jack Crawford shouldn't hold him back. Brian Cox as Dr. Hannibal Lecktor was brilliant and masterful scary, he did a good job, I only wish he would had more screen time with Will Graham.I love the scene after Will visits Hannibal, he runs out of the building for been so scared of Hannibal. I also like Brian Cox in cell talking on the phone with Will that was beautiful scene.I also like the song on the end of the credits HEARTBEAT Performed by Red 7. The title of the movie ""Manhunter"" was credit because the film producers feared that people will think that it is a kung fu movie.I am giving Manhunter 8 out of 10 to me it is a tie with Red Dragon. I like this film a lot, a lot and it is my third favorite film in the Hannibal series. Silence will always be number one movie, it was the first movie I saw it.Manhunter is a 1986 American crime horror thriller film based on Thomas Harris' novel Red Dragon.

92,eminkl,No surprise it took Hollywood another sixteen years to give it another shot,3,18 April 2020,"Moviegoing audiences get their first peek at Hannibal Lecter in this underachieving early adaptation of Thomas Harris's first novel, Red Dragon. Brian Cox is first in line to tackle Lecter, but seems misdirected. He comes off as just some guy in a cell, not the overwhelming, absurdly intimidating presence he is in the book or, later, in the expert hands of Anthony Hopkins or Mads Mikkelsen. That's not the only bit of directorial blunder. In fact, given the amount of star power involved in the film and the gripping power of the source material, it's a major surprise that it's all so blunt, dull and empty. William Peterson (of later CSI fame) leads the show as Will Graham - bland, erratic and prone to nearly-comical mood swings - with a similarly underwhelming effort from character actor Dennis Farina as his supervisor, Jack Crawford. And it's not like the director is some hack. Michael Mann is typically very good behind the camera, but in this case he's just completely missed the mark. There's no underlying tension to the proceedings, none of the complicated character arcs that made the original tale so engrossing. Francis Dollarhyde, the fascinating maniac behind the string of murders driving it all, is cut off at the knees thanks to a criminal lack of exploration. His famous full-torso tattoo is left glaringly off-screen, the false teeth that become his trademark converted into a rudimentary, totally unexplained, side prop. As he falls, so does the film. Despite the two-hour running time, it seems shallow and incomplete, rushed to an unsatisfying new ending that's painfully generic. No surprise it took Hollywood another sixteen years to give it another shot - this is a stain.",Manhunter
93,juanmuscle,Very interesting....,10,26 December 2018,"I do not know the source material but yes I know Michael Mann as we all do for we love his films. I see in his imdb that he has written a lot hitherto the making of this film but something tells me that by 1986 Mr. Mann wanted to experiment, thereby embark on a journey to self-discovery via the vehicle of prose and perhaps in doing so coming out the other side with a more poignant understanding of timeline, of perhaps a keener awakening to the scope of narrating as it attends to plot thereby pearing down what is not ""needed"" and inserting what is integral to the central scope of the story; and I think he was able to do that, I'm sure someone who has read the book could expatiate on this further but I get a sense that Mr. Mann was attempting to not only broach the boundaries of story but to go beyond it and see what ""he and his talents"" could bring to found art thereby taking his imagination into disparate uncharted lands; to transcend and perhaps be transported as he makes strides on the quest to his greatest more involved and triumphal inspiring all self-creative projects? I don't know, but its clear to see, being a fan, what he brings exclusively to something so inclusive and once again touching as well as grotesquely bound to that sick ***t he works with being an expertise penologist! Lol, as Pacino exclaims in our beloved ""Heat"" , I don't know, I'm being presumptuous here and I don't care I love Michael and mostly for two things , essentially the only two things that matter or are in storytelling, firstly the mechanical side, I think Michael was born with this gift as he naturally builds the scaffolding thereby reconstructing a formidable reformation to the undercurrent but as well as the latter creative super artistic side which he has but had to hone in and work on as we from the ""first Heat"" in contrast to the second although just as grimy and cool is more refined and polished version! I love him and I wish to study him.... his fantastic love you!",Manhunter
94,agmoldham,The best Lector movie,7,12 August 2004,Manhunter was released a few years before 'Silence of the lambs'. I've finally got around to watching the movie and found it to be a shade better than the award winner. This film is much more of a suspense and contains many of the same characters and plot lines of lambs.Will Graham (Petersen) is brought back from retirement to help trace a serial killer. Graham originally retired after a far too close encounter with Lector. He goes to see Lector to get assistance with the investigation and also to get him into the mind-set. As with Clarice Starling the Graham character is really the central performance and Petersen is outstanding in the role. Mann turns in an excellent performance from behind the cameras and the supporting cast are also excellent. 8/10,Manhunter
95,Pedro_H,Passable 80's spooky corridor thriller - but mostly old hat and haircut.,6,21 October 2004,"Unlike other reviewers I saw this thriller when it came out and therefore before the hype that was the Silence of the Lambs.Thomas Harris never watches the films that are made from his books and this is a good idea given people such as Ian Fleming were ruined by big screen success. The book works better because it is about logic, puzzle and clues. Film prefers action to to thought. You can only focus so long on a furrowed brow.I am puzzled by the spelling of the locked-up psycho as Lecktor - what is that about? Everyone seems to say that this is the same character as in the other three Hannibel Lector films, so I have to join in. But why the new spelling - they revised the original book spelling (Lector) in the re-make. I searched IMDb for an explanation, got none!This features a clean looking high-tech prison which contrasts with the drab, under lit, sordid holes where the crimes of these prisoners usually took place. I think this represents a more likely atmosphere for keeping high risk prisoners. After all the prison would want to check what the prisoners were doing - half light would aid subterfuge.The good thing about this horror/thriller is that thing makes sense. The case is built clue-by-clue until the whole thing is cracked. More perspiration than inspiration. I won't tell you how - because that is a spoiler - but you find yourself nodding and agreeing. The only problem is that it is not that exciting or intriguing. It slips by like lukewarm TV and by the end I had enough of it for life.Mann is a good director, but he has learned too many cheap tricks from television. The camera seems to have been plonked down casually at middle distance or put on a trolley following the hero down that old spooky corridor. The music is cheap too - I have heard better on a PC game.Add the minor name actors (including mulletman lead William Louis Petersen) you get a feel that this wasn't planned as an A grade movie. And you can see why it didn't set the box office on fire.If you are thriller fan then this will pass the time nicely, but it is minor league stuff. It was dug up again after Silence went ape at the box office, but it would still be buried otherwise.",Manhunter
96,witster18,A Masterpiece.,9,16 November 2010,"This will continue to ease into Cult-classic status, which is a shame, considering this film would blow-up with critical acclaim if it were released today.Michael Mann has created his own world here. It's a realistic, scary, yet completely beautiful movie that will probably never receive the attention it truly deserves.This film is crafted with a similar attention to detail as 'A Clockwork Orange' or '2001'. There's just something that tells the viewer as he/she is watching it - that somebody behind the camera REALLY CARED about what he was putting on film.SOme of the little editing nuances, lighting, and music blend together like coffee and cream.William Peterson's performance is pitch-perfect for the character who seems completely obsessed with his mission. Very similar to 'Unbreakable' from M. Night, or the Red Dragon remake, only this has twice the style and attention to detail.I Love this movie!You'll like it if you liked: Collateral, Silence of the Lambs, Unbreakable, Highlander, and To Live and Die In L.A.The Blue-hues here are just all-over as Mann makes that one of his trademarks... loaded with style, suspense and horror.

It's accurate and historic. The pacing is good and the 80s noir is beautiful (except everybody's house looks alike). The ending is a little melodramatic preach for me. One thing odd about this flick is how well it ages. I like it better now than I did back in the day. Hannibal is already incarcerated in solitary but still pulls strings.",Manhunter
99,artzau,Not a bad thriller,6,28 August 2001,"It's grossly unfair to compare a 1986 film to its later counterparts.  As a film, this has an amazing darkness that is tension-fraught from beginning to end.  No, Brian Cox is not Sir Tony, nor does he pretend to be.  But, that doesn't detract the film in the least.  William Peterson's acting in this film is very uneven, going from a twitching stare to a jerky expression of adolescent nerdiness.  But, Kim Griest's presentation gives truth to every blond joke we've ever heard with her god-awful performance.  Denny Farina makes a more convincing bad guy and mafioso than a cop but is solid in his performance and Tom Noonan is absolutely eerie.  All in all, this is not a bad film and the comparisons made in these reviews too often miss the point: it's easy to make something done previously better with more money and talent.  When you add the likes of Tony Hopkins, Scott Glen and Jodie Foster, you gotta come up with something fine.  There's nothing wrong with this film and Michael Mann's effort is not lost in bringing this dark story to the screen.",Manhunter
100,redkiwi,Was it worth the effort?,6,26 February 2001,"The obvious thing to say about this film is that Brian Cox is not Sir Anthony Hopkins in his role as Hannibal Lector.However, this could be forgiven if he was even a bit scary -- he wasn't! All in all, I found his role perhaps the most credible in the film, which is a little worrying as otherwise it might be a good film!The soundtrack was a highlight, or a lowlight more like.  All that phenomenally naff 80s synthesizer music - that the likes of Jan Hammer have a lot to answer for - abounds as the film gets towards an allegedly gripping climax.The FBI agent was thoroughly weird, not only because he employed Lector to help him catch the mass murderer, but his level of getting inside a murderer's mind was more than a bit extreme, and not easily believable at the same time.",Manhunter

But it's definitely sort of a prequel to ""Silence of the Lambs"", by the same author. Like that other film, it's a gripping story about forensic science and criminal psychology. And unlike most campy crime stories these days, the bad guy is NOT the cop's best friend or even anybody we've seen previously in the film at all. (I don't think that's a spoiler. Like most crimes, the policemen and women of course do not happen to know the criminal, right?)The movie is spooky, the acting is good, and the protagonist is actually interesting, not just a generic guy. I've seen it recently and (unlike many movies of the 1980s) it's still quite good!Who should see this film:-- action/thriller types: a must-see-- anybody who enjoyed Silence of the LambsI'll give ""Manhunter"" an 8 out of 10.",Manhunter
102,JoelChamp85,The Beginnings Of A Great Saga,7,9 April 2021,"It's another adventure of Will Graham, and the first to be made into film, and as usual it follows disturbed individuals, also Will is tanned and a woman's man in this version. It very much has that 80's Mann film style about it, backed by extremely 80's style music - if I could change one thing I'd probably ease up on the 80's soundtrack and add some original scores. But, the presence and mind frame of the killer is well done.",Manhunter
103,loganx-2,Manhunter From Earth,6,5 September 2008,"I resisted seeing this for a long time, mostly because of how bad the title, was and is, but that's the biggest strike against this movie, that and the music, but still...Better then ""Red Dragon"" hands down, better than ""Silence Of The Lambs""...different. ""Silence Of The Lambs"" is a kind of a horror film with psychological motifs, this is a psychological film with elements of a thriller, the difference being this film is less exciting and a bit more thoughtful, but not too much. The music is terrible, but oddly effective, as opposed to everything and everyone being terrifying and inhuman as in Red Dragon and The Silence, and Hannibal, and Hannibal Rising, all of the characters are frail, the killer here looking more ridiculous and sad and then intimidating, same goes for the ""hard boiled detective"".It's a more stylized ""Red Dragon"" but the stylization helps really underline those elements of the story, which for me anyway, really make it interesting; the home movies aspect, the symbol of the eyes, the melting personalities, merging desires, the role of the observer and analyst, etc. Hannibal Lecter is not the star of the show here, and the film benefits.",Manhunter
104,AKS-6,Quite suspenseful,7,24 November 2001,"Finally -- thanks to the recent DVD-release in Sweden -- I have been able to watch this Michael Mann movie. It seems that for every year that passes Manhunter gets more hype. So, I think it is impossible to watch this movie now, for the first time, without having high expectations. I certainly did!Even though Manhunter does not live up to the relative hype of recent years it is still a very good film. It's quite suspenseful -- though not nearly as scary as I thought Silence of the Lambs was when I saw that movie for the first time in '91. The acting is also great (especially by William Petersen, Joan Allen and Tom Noonan). (7/10)",Manhunter

It's different from your classic crime movie, because we see a lot more of the killer's perspective. Cox is different from Hopkins in the role of Hannibal, but still gives a very good performance. While ""Silence of the Lambs"" is more centered on Clarice and Hannibal, this movie is more centered on the killer, but the persona of main character suffers in return. Still, I recommend the movie, as I think it's good and everyone who says that he loves crime movies and thrillers should watch this one. 8/10!",Manhunter
106,PeachHamBeach,WHY did they remake this film!!!???,10,15 March 2005,"They had no REASON to!!! Oh don't give me that baloney about how Anthony Hopkins is the ONLY Lector!!! Please!!! Hopkins was terrific in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, but the senseless gratuitous gore of HANNIBAL turned me off...and then they just HAD to go and remake MANHUNTER (giving IT the name of RED DRAGON, which this original should have been christened!!!) and by this time, Hopkins was 10 years or so older...does Lector age in REVERSE or something???!!! Not only this, but the newer film, with Edward Norton and Ralph Fiennes is so WIMPY in comparison...not just wimpy, BORING. I wasn't even scared during the new movie!!! Norton, normally an above average actor, was dull and stilted compared with the intense, crackling William Petersen of the 1986 movie. Fiennes acted like a whimpery dork compared with the incredibly evil, bone chilling performance of one Tom Noonan!!! Noonan IS the red dragon, the devil personified. His scenes with that reporter guy were just AWESOME!!! And props to Brian Cox for being the ORIGINAL Lector...this is the guy that Hopkins studied. The original film was intense and disturbing, and Petersen portrays Graham's mental injuries very believably, whereas Norton in the new movie just didn't seem touched by anything.This movie brings to mind one of my favorite mottos: ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it!!!""",Manhunter
107,chrisbrown6453,What a disappointment this movie is.,4,4 March 2001,"It's amazing how such an startling masterpiece as Silence of the Lambs could have derived from such a horrific story such as Red Dragon, or, in this particular case, Manhunter.  Adapted from the book Red Dragon: The Pursuit of Hannibal Lector, Manhunter follows FBI agent William Graham as he solicits the help of Dr. Hannibal Lecktor (note the spelling of his name in this film as opposed to the later two).  It's a shame that this film was actually made 5 years earlier than Silence of the Lambs (1991) and no one had really even heard of it.  I now know why.Not a very entertaining film, Manhunter grossly underachieved what the great Thomas Harris tried to bring to the audience through his book.  Not to be confused with the Academy Award winning Lambs, Manhunter seriously lacks any smidgen of character development.  We never truly understand Will Graham, and as good as Brian Cox is (Nuremberg), it was just too hard to believe anyone else to be the `great' Hannibal Lector.  Maybe it is because, like so many others before me, I watched Lambs first, Manhunter drew a great sigh from my chest, and made me very happy when the credits finally began.",Manhunter
108,Rautus,A great thriller,10,7 August 2007,"Manhunter is based on the novel Red Dragon written by Thomas Harris, the film is a great thriller that has some nice suspense, interesting lighting, great acting, creepy music and a nice soundtrack. Although I like Anthony Hopkins as Hannible Lecter I found Brain Cox to be a more human Hannible and that's why I also like him as Lecter, his cell is not dark and creepy like in Silence of the Lambs (although it is very atmospheric and I find it cool) but a bright white. William Petersen is great as Will Graham, he shows what it must be like to go into the mind of a killer and when he talks to Lecter a man who he captured but got injured in the process he holds in his fear and emotions towards him. Tom Noolan did a great job as Francis Dollarhyde since he's quiet and shy, you feel sorry for him but also feel scared of him because he's a killer.Manhunter is my favourite out of the Hannible movies but I still enjoy watching the others, this is a thriller that should be seen. 10/10P.S: Check out Hannible's last name it's spelt Lecktor in this one but Lecter in the others.",Manhunter
109,Cinemaniac1984,A very underappreciated and underrated thriller which is still great viewing.,8,1 October 2021,"Based on the novel Red Dragon by Thomas Harris, Manhunter is a very underrated and underappreciated thriller that is still an enjoyable movie 35 years later. Initially a box office flop despite positive reviews, it has since become a cult classic and the series would also be resurrected with the Academy Award winning The Silence of the Lambs (1991).Retired FBI profiler Will Graham (William Peterson, CSI) has moved to a beachside home in Florida for a quiet life alongside his wife Molly (Kim Greist, Throw Momma From The Train) and son Kevin (David Seaman). Will Graham is still bearing the physical and mental scars after suffering a breakdown following an encounter with serial killer Hannibal Lektor (Brian Cox, The Bourne Supremacy) who he successfully put behind bars after Lektor tried to kill him. Will Graham is coaxed out of retirement by his former boss Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina, Get Shorty) to act as a consultant for the FBI to catch the elusive serial killer known as the ""Tooth Fairy"" (Tom Noonan, Robocop 2) who is responsible for the horrific murders of families across the USA. To try to find clues to get in the mind of the Tooth Fairy, Will Graham reluctantly seeks out the advice of the incarcerated Lektor. Though Lektor toys with Graham, he agrees to help look at the case. As well as part of a sting to try and draw out the Tooth Fairy, Graham and Crawford call upon sleazy tabloid reporter Freddie Lounds (Stephen Lang, Avatar) to hold a fake interview to further defame the Tooth Fairy with derogatory remarks implying he is ugly and impotent. It is revealed that there is a film processing technician named Francis Dolarhyde who is revealed to be the Tooth Fairy and is behind the slayings. Dolarhyde has befriended a blind co worker Reba McClane (Joan Allen, Face/Off) but little does she realise the danger she may have found herself in oblivious to Dolarhyde's double life. Will Graham finds himself in a race against time to stop Francis Dolarhyde before he slays another family and also before he targets Will Graham and his family.William Peterson does well as the tourmented profiler Will Graham. Brian Cox was great as Hannibal Lektor. Tom Noonan was chilling as the Tooth Fairy/Francis Dolarhyde. The late Dennis Farina was always ever reliable as Jack Crawford. Stephen Lang turns the sleaze factor up as Freddie Lounds. Joan Allen had a good role as the blind and vulnerable Reba McClane. Director Michael Mann did a great job bringing Thomas Harris' novel to life on the big screen. Michael Mann also showed that he is an excellent director back then and still continues to do so with classics such as Heat (1995) and Collateral (2004).Manhunter is an underappreciated movie but is now a cult classic and has since gained a positive reception 35 years on. I still enjoy watching this underrated gem from time to time, and it's also great to see the cast go onto bigger and better things. Manhunter is still a great movie to watch but is often forgotten after Anthony Hopkins took over the role as Hannibal Lector in The Silence of the Lambs (1991) and its sequels Hannibal (2001) and Red Dragon (2002).8/10.",Manhunter
110,emperor_bender,"""Remember how you got me!""",8,24 February 2008,"This is a very good movie. The story was very well thought out and came together nicely. Will Graham was wonderfully played by William Petersen (probably best known from CSI). Most of the characters were excellent. There were a few flaws with this movie also however. One was that there were a few major plot holes in the story. Mainly how Hannibal was caught and put in that cell in the first place. Another is Brian Cox...I don't think he really fits the part of Hannibal at all. He wasn't bad, but I don't know...he failed to scare me, or even strike me as sophisticated, creepy, eerie, sneaky, or anything like Hannibal is in Silence of the Lambs. Then again, this movie cannot be judged on a small performance such as that. I mean, hes only in the movie for like 3 scenes, nothing big. Tom Noonan was excellent as the shady, odd Francis Dolarhyde. I recommend this movie to crime movie fans all over. 8/10.",Manhunter

Michael Mann's crime thriller is dark, gritty, interesting and visually arresting, with highly stylised editing and photography. The excellent performance of William Peterson as Will Graham is intense and powerful, as is Brian Cox in arguably the most memorable and subtle Leckor to grace the screen. His role is small but very memorable and calmly chilling. Tom Noonan is haunting as Francis Dolerhyde and the treatment of the characters tormented personality is very good. The film is a masterful crime thriller, and a critics favourite, the 2002 remake Red Dragon fell short in every department, surprisingly due to the actors involved, all Oscar nominees or winners, with no dis-respect to the excellent cast here who managed to outshine the likes of Ed Norton and Ralph Fiennes, and of course Tony Hopkins. ****",Manhunter
112,Bogey Man,Effective and thought provoking thriller by one of America's most talented directors,9,5 January 2003,"Michael Mann is easily one of the most talented and interesting American film makers from the early eighties to this day. His filmography includes the legendary TV series Miami Vice (1984) as well as the cult horror film The Keep (1983) with incredible Tangerine Dream soundtrack, The Last of the Mohicans (1992), Heat (1995) with Al Pacino and Robert de Niro and this first film to introduce Hannibal Lecter (or Lecktor as in the film), Manhunter (1986), an extremely stylish and restrained serial killer thriller that has more depth, intelligence and impact than most of the later and previous serial killer thriller attempts.William Petersen from William Friedkin's nihilistic To Live and Die in L.A. (1985) stars in Manhunter as Will Graham, a former FBI agent who is asked to come back for one case by his colleaque (Dennis Farina) as a brutal and totally unknown serial killer has attacked already two times at the time of full moon. The police and FBI are helpless and don't know how to get the murderer and stop the horrible killings. Graham was the one who caught Hannibal Lecter three years ago so the force knows his abilities and decides to ask him for help. He agrees, no matter what he's promised to his understanding wife (Kim Greist) and son (David Seaman), and soon starts to fall deeper and deeper into the mind of the disturbed killer that he is so willing to capture before the next full moon.The film is based on the Thomas Harris book Red Dragon and the subsequent 'Hannibal films', the academy award winning Silence of the Lambs (Jonathan Demme, 1991), Hannibal (Ridley Scott, 2001) and Red Dragon (Brett Ratner, 2002) can be seen as sequels to this earlier Mann film. Manhunter does not concentrate too much on the Hannibal character as he is not among the lead characters here. He is played by the British Brian Cox with great and menacing charisma that went even further in the later films where the psychopath doctor was played by Anthony Hopkins. Manhunter's greatest power lies in its depiction of the killer (Tom Noonan, a very tall and scary looking guy!) himself as he is not just depicted as faceless animal without any other meaning to be in the film than just killing.There are many strong emotional moments in the film and one of the greatest is the one in which the killer, perhaps for the first time ever in his life, falls in love and starts to care about someone. As he lies in the bed with the sleeping girl and looks into the roof and holds her hand it is again so obvious how powerful cinema can be and is without any words or dialogue. Rarely have I seen anything like this what happens when he puts her unconscious hand on his face to cover his mouth. This wordless and silent scene tells very much about the killer character and (thus) about some very important things that should be included in human life in order to live balanced and with one's own feelings. Still the killer character in my opinion desires to be even more detailed and told about his motives and background (no matter how powerful the mentioned scene is) as all we get to learn about him after all is what Graham gets analyzed and revealed about him. In order to get him, Graham starts to think like him and act like him, and that is what scares the others as he had some very severe mental problems using the same technique while chasing Lecktor. He just has to beware of not crossing the line.Also the various dark sides of human nature are touched here especially in the scenes depicting Graham character's journey inside himself and his feelings when he comes closer and closer to insanity and wickedness he finds from the killer and Dr. Lecktor, too. Hannibal's character is again devilishly wise and calculating and he knows what are the weakest sides of Graham and he surely will use his intelligence against them in order to break the man. Some very interesting things are included in the discussions between Hannibal and Graham as for instance the morale and even enjoyment and instinct of killing get discussed in the most difficult way and point but the conclusion still (fortunately) is that Graham just visits the border but never crosses it, and that border is exactly the one that should not be crossed by anyone and it just should be recognized, admitted and kept on the background and away.The visuals and other magic elements of cinema are here as brilliant as can be expected from the director Mann. Cinematography by Italian Dante Spinotti is fantastic, powerful and still very restrained and none of the elements and techniques used are in vain or without their purpose. They are there to depict the atmosphere and feelings of the characters', all characters, and the result is genuinely visual, not artificially so. The lighting, the angles, the drives and everything are perfectly balanced with the hypnotic soundtrack by Reds and Michel Rubini. The beginning at the Leeds apartment features some of the creepiest images and moments I've seen in cinema and the photography and camerawork are here as important as the soundtrack. And Manhunter is not the only film by Mann that has soundtrack as wonderful as this: the Tangerine Dream music in The Keep is perhaps even more hypnotic and magical.The finale is also worth mentioning as it includes very innovative and heart stoppingly effective and unconventional camerawork and editing as they used various techniques and camera speeds to achieve the effect. The slow motions and edits really show how talented Mann is also as a cameraman and he likes to work very closely in the cinematography department in his own films, too. The lighting and gorgeous neo, green, purple and other colors and lights coming through the windows and camera lenses are something as wonderful as those in the greatest efforts from Hong Kong, like Bride With White Hair (Ronny Yu, 1993) and Dr. Lamb (Danny Lee and Billy Tang, 1992) to name just a few. Michael Mann has the kind of sense of visual style and striking storytelling that he, alongside Sam Peckinpah and Kathryn Bigelow, is perhaps the closest Western equivalent to the Eastern directors especially and also when it comes to kinetic and fierce action. If you are in doubt, watch Mann's Heat and its incredible city war sequence in the middle part of the film.Manhunter is the kind of film that makes me love American cinema and (these few American) directors as when they're talented, they're very talented and it is great thing to have makers like Mann active in the industry. Manhunter is among his best achievements and also among the most powerful and memorable American films of the eighties. 9/10",Manhunter
113,charchuk,Bested by its remake,8,4 April 2007,"The first chapter in the Hannibal Lecter saga, it's also an early indication of Michael Mann's impressive skill as a director. The film is expertly crafted and very stylish, which makes up for the story and acting flaws. And there are quite a few. While I think this is definitely better directed than Red Dragon - not surprising, given the two directors involved - it is not nearly as well-written or as well-acted. William Petersen is the lone bright spot, as he's the only one from the cast better than their Dragon counterpart; he delivers an effective and sympathetic performance. Brian Cox is solid as Lecter (spelled Lecktor in this one) but he's nowhere near Hopkins' iconic character, and Tom Noonan is creepy but underused as Dolarhyde. This one deviates more from the book to take creative license, and that lowers it, in my eyes, though the climax - with ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" - is excellent. A solid addition to the franchise, but it's bested by Red Dragon.",Manhunter
114,rooee,Mr Mann's calling card,8,12 April 2010,"Director Michael Mann wouldn't find global recognition until 1992's Last of the Mohicans, but this 1986 detective thriller, based on Thomas Harris's novel Red Dragon, is still well-loved and has now found new life in the form of this Special Edition.William Peterson plays Will Graham, a jaded detective charged with hunting down the ""Tooth Fairy"" (Tom Noonan), a killer who preys by the light of the full moon. To track the killer, Graham must ""recover the mindset"", and so he consults his arch nemesis Hannibal Lecktor (renamed 'Lecter' in later adaptations).Peterson's Graham may seem bland and one-dimensional compared to Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling, but it's worth remembering where each character begins. Silent and repressive, Graham is pared-down memory of his former self; the shadow of Lecktor looms so heavily upon him he's no longer sure whose thoughts he's thinking. The scene in the supermarket in which Graham reveals the truth of his past to his son (David Seaman) is played out like a confession: in a triumphant surge of music, Graham is purged. Starling, by comparison, is a rookie - she has no previous. She's nervous and talkative. And, crucially, Lecktor/Lecter loves her, and so we get the full pysch report. Is she a more interesting character? Probably.But it matters little. Lecktor is the star of the show. Here, Brian Cox plays the old cannibal with classic restraint. Hopkins' version was a pantomime monster, skulking in his dark, dank dungeon. Cox's villain is shrouded in heavenly white; his menace is achieved through poise and understatement. The simplicity of his ambiance alludes to the purity of his horrifying intent.Manhunter is a far from perfect film. Graham is the product of a bad TV movie: the jaded cop with the beautiful wife and the penthouse by the sea, and a the private jet waiting on the runway. And the film has dated badly, there's no two ways about it - the Tangerine Dream-esquire music in particular frequently lurches from atmospheric to incongruous in the space of adjacent scenes. But then, one could argue, Mann has since established himself as a pure pop director. At least Manhunter feels like a product of its time, rather than a product of a diseased mind like Mann's own Miami Vice.Excellent support comes from Joan Allen as the blind lady who breaks the Tooth Fairy's heart, as well as Stephen Lang as the irredeemably repugnant Freddie Lounds. Fast-paced, with an exciting and intricate forensics-based plot to follow, as well as a satisfying, stylish climax, Manhunter is well worth purchasing.",Manhunter
115,theshadow908,Underrated 80's action film.,8,13 July 2006,"Manhunter is the movie that introduced Hannibal Lecter into Hollywood, not The Silence of the Lambs. In this movie, a deranged serial killer is killing entire families every month on the night of the full moon. Jack Crawford of the FBI calls in retired agent Will Graham to help catch the killer. Graham left the FBI after being critically wounded while capturing the cannibalistic Hannibal Lecter. Now, Graham must interview Hannibal, to see if he can shed any knowledge on the case. Meanwhile, the killer struggles with himself when he begins to fall in love with a fellow employee. This movie is very underrated and deserves to be included in the series of Hannibal Lecter films.I learned of this movie's existence right after Hannibal came out in 2001 when my mother told me of another movie she once saw with Hannibal Lecter in it. At first I didn't like it at all because I was used to Anthony Hopkins, so Brian Cox's performance bothered me slightly. However, after a second viewing, I realized how good this movie really is. For a B movie that is widely overlooked and flopped, it is very good. Wheras the remake of this movie, Red Dragon, was a psychological thriller, which I also liked, this movie is another 80's cat and mouse action movie, which I also enjoy a lot. The ending is very different from the book, however I really enjoyed the ending of this movie in an action aspect. The ending is much cooler when it comes to action, whereas the ending to Red Dragon is meant more for suspense.The acting in this movie is pretty good. I like Cox's performance much more now because I realized that he had nothing to go off of, and he made the character his own. Anthony Hopkins immortalized the character, for sure, but Cox laid the groundwork. William Petersen is really good as Will Graham, and Tom Noonan is chilling as the Tooth Fairy.Overall, I suggest anyone who liked the three other movies view this movie. After all, The Silence of the Lambs is a sequel to this movie. Give it a chance, and you might enjoy it. I certainly did.8/10",Manhunter
116,Didier-Becu,THE ORIGINAL RED DRAGON,7,12 August 2003,"How many times did I have read that this is the movie you should watch instead of Silence Of The Lambs? Bollocks, even totally bollocks as in no way this can even reach the shadow of Jonathan Demme's masterpiece. The man responsible for it all of course is Anthony Hopkins whose performance is perhaps the bhest I have ever seen and that counts for the two sequels as well. But good fair is fair this movie directed by Michael Mann (famous from Miami Vice) was the first one to come up with the story of Hannibal Lector (here played by Brian Cox, and all by all good for a total of five minutes). And as some of you might know it's actually the third Hannibal-movie ""Red Dragon"" and the whole script (nothing but logic) is like a xeroxcopy. But mind you it's not because of Hopkins superiority I didn't like ""Manhunter"" that much, it's just that I absolutely don't like Mann's directing way. You see he made Miami Vice-episodes as almost all actionscenes are heavily disturbed by awful American FMrockmusic and the acting is beneath everything... You never feel any affinity with the actors, not even when they're brutally murdered. Just watch this as interesting, nothing more.....",Manhunter
117,jcbutthead86,One of the best Thrillers ever made. A Brilliant Classic from Michael Mann.,10,16 November 2012,"Manhunter is one of the best thrillers ever made that's filled with great direction,performances,script and visual style and one of Michael Mann's best films and a classic. It's not only one of my favorite Thrillers but,one of my favorite films of all time.Based on Thomas Harris' novel Red Dragon,Manhunter tells the story about Will Graham(William Petersen)a retired F.B.I agent who catches serial killers and is able to get inside the mind of the killer. Graham is asked to come out of retirement to help catch a serial killer named Francis Dollarhyde(Tom Noonan)nicknamed by the police as The Tooth Fairy who kills every full moon. Out of retirement,Will Graham must find The Tooth Fairy,get into the mindset of the killer and stop him before he kills again.Released in 1986,Manhunter is a brilliant,powerful film that received mixed reviews from critics and was not a Box Office hit. But over the years Manhunter has gained a Cult following and is not only considered one of the best Thrillers ever made but is also the film that paved the way for other classic Serial killer thrillers such as The Silence Of The Lambs(1991)and Se7en(1995)and introduced audiences to the iconic film character Hannibal Lecktor. From beginning to end Manhunter is an amazing and unforgettable film that is truly a cinematic experience that blows you away the first time you watch it because it's not only thrilling and intense but also mesmerizing and gripping. One of the things I love about Manhunter is the way it's structured. The first hour focuses on Will Graham,the cops,the mystery and investigation of the killer and why,when and where he will do his murders and killings and as a viewer you are glued to the screen and never bored. The second hour focuses not only on Will Graham and the investigation but also on Frances Dollarhyde and his world and I love the fact we don't see Dollarhyde giving viewers a build-up to his arrival and when we see Dollarhyde for the first time it's scary,frightening and unforgettable. Manhunter is filled with such suspense,atmosphere and has a very dark tone and there is a sense of dread and fear that hangs over the film like a tightrope. Will Graham is a great character that we can identify with because despite having his wife and kid around and being retired you can see that Will feels very isolated and still carries the mental scars of being an FBI agent and hunting down serial killers. When Will is asked to come out of retirement to catch the killer you can tell he doesn't want to do it but feels like he has no choice but to stop the killer. Manhunter succeeds not only as a Thriller but also as a character study of Will Graham his journey into darkness and trying to get out. The photography by Dante Spinotti is beautiful and masterful giving the film and characters different visuals and colors whether it be the colors blue,red or green or the orange of the sunlight that captures the characters state of mind whether it's in the day or night. One of the things I love about films and Film making in general is that a film brings into a world and Manhunter brings a viewer into a world where it's grounded in reality but also a surreal feel to it and you are glued to the screen because the style and visuals just come off the screen and hits you right in the face. Manhunter is one of the most visually stunning films ever made. The screenplay by Michael Mann is terrific and well-written with dialog and scenes that are fresh and memorable. Many fans have been debating over which film is better Manhunter or The Silence Of The Lambs. While both films are similar in terms of story lines,both films are great classics and should be excepted on their own rights. The ending of Manhunter is excellent and thrilling and is filled with great suspense and Action matching the film's tone and is one of the reasons Manhunter is a classic. The cast does great jobs in their roles. William Petersen is excellent and gives maybe the best performance of his career as Will Graham. Petersen brings intensity,depth and greatness to the role. Tom Noonan is brilliant as killer Francis Dollarhyde,one of the best villains in movie history. Noonan is frightening,disturbing and scary in his role. Brian Cox is wonderful and memorable in his small role as Hannibal Lecktor,a serial killer Graham caught and has great scenes with Petersen. Dennis Farina does a great job as Jack Crawford,Graham's friend and F.B.I man who helps Will out. Stephen Lang does a fantastic job as Freddy Lounds,a sleazy tabloid reporter. Kim Greist does a wonderful job as Molly Graham,Will's wife and has a great chemistry with Petersen. Joan Allen is great as Reba,a blind co-worker Dollarhyde romances. Noonan and Allen's scenes together are great and memorable.Michael Mann's direction is fantastic moving the camera and giving the film a unique visual style and keeps the film moving at a fast pace. This is probably Mann's most visually stunning film to date. Great job,Mann.The score by The Reds and Michael Rubini is amazing matching the dark,somber mood of the film and fits in well. The soundtrack is amazing as well with songs like Rubini's Graham's theme,The Prime Movers Strong as I am Shriekback's This Big Hush,Red 7's Heartbeat and Iron Butterfly's IN-A-GADDA-DA-VIDA which is used to great effect at the end. Manhunter's soundtrack is definitely one of my favorite soundtracks.In final word,Manhunter is a flawless classic from beginning to end from the acting,direction,script and style. If you love Thrillers or Cinema in general I highly suggest you see this film. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Manhunter
118,jldmp1,The Movie Within,9,31 May 2006,"This is the pinnacle of Mann's 1980s style -- a coherent and contained package of vision, atmosphere, tone and musical accompaniment...""Miami Vice"" without the kitsch.In fact, there was a ""Vice"" episode (""Shadow in the Dark"") that uses the same narrative: a lunatic home invader and an investigator who loses his grip ""getting into the mindset"". This would all be very ordinary, but...Note the clever construction -- the entire mechanics of the movie are contained within the killer. He literally casts and moves the actors in his ""movie""; he is obsessed with vision...heck, he works in a film laboratory between his ""homework"" assignments.The Tooth Fairy's inspiration is Blake's ""Great Red Dragon"" paintings. This is such a rich source -- Blake being one of the fathers of the modern idea of 'imagination' itself -- that we can seriously take the cinematic idea of his 'glorious becoming'. Using the Doors would have been too obvious, so Mann smartly uses Iron Butterfly as the soundtrack for the climactic scene.Note also Cox's take on Lecktor as a locus of evil -- here he plays the part of the writer...who else can toy with the protagonist this way? He even advises 'one will become as God is', etc. Even better, is Lecktor's containment (in an art museum!). It's difficult to tell who's imprisoning who in that sterile pure white cell...brilliant visual narrative here. Contrast that with the clumsy way 'Lecter's' dungeon was presented in ""Lambs"".Mann even has Petersen square off with the architecture of the crime scene, rather like Leone's spaghetti gunfighters.It's the cinematic richness that sets this apart from the pack -- how could this have flopped at the box office?",Manhunter
119,random_avenger,Manhunter,8,4 August 2010,"Detective Will Graham (William Petersen), a retired FBI serial killer specialist reluctantly returns to work to catch a murderer (Tom Noonan) who has killed two entire families. The press has nicknamed the killer ""Tooth Fairy"" and in order to outwit him Graham must relearn to think like a killer, an ability he has tried to forget due to traumatic experiences in the past. To achieve his goal, he consults the notorious imprisoned serial killer and master of psychological manipulation Dr. Hannibal Lecktor (Brian Cox) who has been put behind bars earlier by Graham.Even though the now-tacky synth-driven score never allows the viewer to forget which decade the movie was made in, the overall style hasn't dated at all. Director Mann's cold and cerebral portrayal of the world of Will Graham is still effective, and the shocking scene of death-by-fire comes across as highly memorable thanks to the general focus on mood rather than violence. The more tender scenes between the murderer and a blind woman (Joan Allen), such as her caressing a sedated tiger, are very haunting and add more layers to the killer's already interesting character.It may be unfair to compare Manhunter to the Lecter movies that came out many years after it, but the Hannibal character portrayed by Anthony Hopkins in three movies has become so iconic that it's impossible to not instantly think of him when hearing the name Lecter. Even though Brian Cox looks somewhat menacing too, he is no match for Anthony Hopkins, but the role is quite small so it doesn't affect the overall quality much. The other actors do generally a good job; especially Tom Noonan looks very creepy in all of his scenes and is much more convincing in the role than Ralph Fiennes is in Red Dragon (2002), a later movie version of the same Thomas Harris novel. William ""CSI"" Petersen is also good as the main good guy.In the end, Manhunter is a well-made thriller and recommended to any fan of the Lecter books. What it loses with the Hannibal character, it wins back with Tooth Fairy and provides good entertainment for friends of serial killer thrillers.",Manhunter
120,barberoux,A TV movie.,4,22 September 2001,"Manhunter was pretty bad.  I had to fast forward through the painful love scenes, what maudlin crap.  The movie was pretty faithful to the book until the end which degenerated into a ridiculous TV show type end.  Tom Noonan was good as the killer and I think he  would have been very good if the movie investigated his motives and background more and allow more of the troubled, painful side of the character to emerge.  As it was he was just a cliche and a plot device.  Dennis Farina was as good as the script allowed and Joan Allen, as always, was good but she had a very limited role and a poor script to work with.  William L. Petersen was self absorbed and was pretty bad.  The rest of the cast were forgettable.  Don't bother with it.",Manhunter

I was stunned by watching it, no less. Under the glamour and stylized surface there's a work that's light years ahead of 1986.The precise technical details of forensic analysis, the disturbing emotional relationships between characters, the plot that you could not see coming, and the outstanding scene with the tiger... what a movie!As for the ""dated"" aesthetics, I think it was a conscious decision by Mann to be so extreme (think of contrast between glamour and horror). Also, I think that with the New Retro Wave surging it's not so dated anymore... The Neon Demon has so many things in common with it.And let me add this, that ""The Silence of the Lambs"" owes so much to Manhunter that it's a shame it's not as popular.

122,pkpera,Direction is weakest part of this movie,6,16 December 2018,"Yes, call me crazy, but I give it rating 6, and say that direction is what ruined this potentially great movie.
Just watched it for second time after spotted on by 'accident' . Was not even sure who W. Petersen will hunt, and who will be his advisor. It was some 30 years ago.Let's start with acting: none of actors in this movie is in range of Al Pacino, Robert de Niro, Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster . Yeah, it is just impossible to write review of this movie without comparisons with later 'Lecktor' or M. Mann movies.
But they did their best. And are for sure good actors. Maybe Kim Greist is not that good. In begin I thought that she was chosen only because her beautyness, but later thought that directing and text were rather what made her role unconvincing .
William Petersen is type cast actor, that's now clear. I really did not see him in anything than crime, playing some detective, investigator. He was fine here, but was not grown actor. I think that was better even in CSI .Tom Noonan was actually second main actor in this movies, but listed only on 6-th place. Considering screen time and relevance for the story. Not to mention that this was in some way duel between him and Will . And probably best performance.Pace of movie was inconsistent - what is of course to blame on director.
With his forced, overdone, slow direction of many scenes. Yeah, that's when you want dramatic effect in wrong way. And music just made it worse .
Maybe best example is scene near end when Will runs toward window. That was just lame, and in my case just made opposite effect - instead moving me made be thinking: ""what he thought when decided to make it this way ? "" .Well, probably same error like what we seen in 2 much more famous movies:
Heaven's Gate and The Postman. Except that 2 Oscar winner directors of them made it even more obvious and annoying: there was actually plenty of such, but there are two what I remember well, and actually became famous (in negative aspect) . Both with horse: When Kris Kristofferson was in dilemma where to ride - left or right - he turned his poor horse, who deserved really better too many times before went in only way (the expectable one) ... In Postman it was when director and main actor Kevin Costner ran on his horse multiple times in front of mail box ... That's probably most blatant example of overdramatized scene . Sorry, I really needed to give some extreme examples, because that's what ruined this movie - overdramatized, pretentious direction in so many scenes.Otherwise, this was actually better than Red Dragon - well, in many aspects. We saw really detailed, almost forensic presentation of police work. What would be in my opinion best quality if this movie.",Manhunter

The score sounds to me like Vangelis having a bad hair day (and I'm a big fan of synthesizers). There is far too much exposition, which is always a sign that the screenwriter failed in properly translating the literary medium to the visual medium of film.Acting here is rather mediocre... not poor, but nothing remarkable. And perhaps worst of all -- this film lacks Anthony Hopkins. As ridiculous as that may sound, he *is* Hannibal Lecter. Nobody can do Lecter like he can. Any ""Hannibal Lecter"" movie without Hopkins is automatically missing something. This is just my opinion of course, and I recognize that some people may not care too much who plays Lecter.I found myself getting bored and a bit drowsy while watching this, and the feeling never left. I barely managed to sit through this film. In case you want to peg me as a kid unable to appreciate pre-90's films, I'm 40 years old and some of my all time favorite movies were made in the late 70's through mid 80's. This one just lacks the taut script, production values, acting, cinematography, musical score and visual storytelling ability of ""Red Dragon."" Contrary to what many have said while reviewing the aforementioned movie, this one *was* ripe for a remake. It would have been a shame to leave perhaps the best of Thom Harris's ""Hannibal"" books with this lousy adaptation.Not having read the book, I'm not sure how much ""Red Dragon"" stole from ""Manhunter,"" and how much came from the book. All I can say is that ""Red Dragon"" does it better in every conceivable respect. Skip this turkey, and rent ""Red Dragon"" instead.

127,shadowman123,80's nostalgia,8,28 May 2008,"Manhunter , is Micheal Mann's take on Thomas Harris's novel Red Dragon featuring everyones favourite cannibal Hannibal Lector. Its easy to understand why some people would choose this over Red Dragon, reason being it has a classic 80's vibe to it which is just plain 'cool' to be honest. The Will Graham over here is actually a moody and genuine troubled character rather than a almost measly Ed Norton , Brian Cox's is role on Lector is actually one that makes the character very creepy rather the Welshman Hopkin's who makes the character look intriguing and I often wonder what it would of been like if he went on to star in the other Hannibal movies. Dolarhyde over here is played in such a way where he actually frightening but then at the same time sympathetic but not a lot like Ralph Fiennes version were one actually feels sorry for him. The pace at which the movie moves at is good although it might feel a little slow in places and might have a few unnecessary bits in it which probably make it a little longer than it need be. However Manhunter is certainly worth a check out , it might not be the best book-to-movie adaptations but having after seeing it is easy to understand why people would prefer this over the original as in someways it is more entertaining than Red Dragon , Worth a look at if your a fan of Hannibal and also thrillers or if you just fancy watching something different.RED DRAGON - 8 OUT OF 10HANNIBAL LECTORS LEGACEY OF EVIL BEGINS HERE...",Manhunter
128,Brogan,Scarier and better than Silence.,10,4 October 2000,"I just recently saw Michael Mann's MANHUNTER for the first time.  When it originally came out back in 1986, I remember seeing ads for it all over Los Angeles.  I knew what it was, but I really had no desire to see it.  It wasn't until after seeing the blockbuster SILENCE OF THE LAMBS that I did gain intrest in seeing this film.  But after seeing and falling in love with both HEAT (1995) and THE INSIDER by director Michael Mann, then this film was on my ""must-see"" list. MANHUNTER is based on the best selling Thomas Harris novel, ""Red Dragon"" which is also known as the prequal to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  There are some of the same characters in both stories, Jack Crawford, Dr. Chilton, and of course the popular Dr. Hannibal Lecter(spelled Lektor in this film). Will Graham (William L. Petersen) is a retired federal investigator who gave up his job due to the trauma he suffered when he captured Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Brian Cox).  Graham is then approached by Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina) to come back to the the FBI when two families are slaughter grotesquely by the ""Tooth Fairy Killer"" (Tom Noonan).  Graham hesitates, but goes ahead and tracks down the killer by going to the scene of the crime, and thinking like the killer.  When Graham is at the houses of the two murdered families, he thinks about how if he was the killer, what would he do.  But things get rough for Graham, first there's the annoying tabloid journalist Freddie Lounds (Stephen Lang) who constantly gets in Graham's way.  Then there is Hannibal Lecter, who communicates with the killer and informs him on Graham's investigation.  And Graham has little time left before the next full moon (when the killer usually stirkes) before the next victim, Reba (Joan Allen) a blind photographer is killed. I found MANHUNTER to be a better film than it's award winning sequal. Here's why:  1.) the film isn't cliched by now, where SILENCE has character's from different movie and t.v. shows imitating Hannibal Lecter, MANHUNTER has a taste of originality.  2.) Anthony Hopkins was flamboyant as Lecter in SILENCE, he took a scary character and was performing him as if it was Shakespeare.  Where underrated Brian Cox, gives Lecter more of a realistic and creepy feel.  3.) The style of SILENCE is at the same degree of a t.v. movie.  Where MANHUNTER has the style of a cinematic artist.  Michael Mann, along with his confidant, cinematographer Dante Spinotti, gives MANHUNTER the same look and feel as they did in both HEAT and THE INSIDER.  The more modern style of music, and the blue coloring of the scenes. I found MANHUNTER to be a piece of work by a brilliant director, who just went on to make classic films of modern cinema.  I loved the style that Mann makes the film appear, the electroinc score, the blue coloring, the witty and intelligent characters, and the intriguing and fast pacing plot. I thought the acting was also well done, where SILENCE director Johnathan Demme had Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins give all they got to make their character's award winning.  Mann doesn't have any of the actors upstage one another, making the film more real. And besides, Michael Mann spent time on the Chicago police force, he's had his experiences with crime and criminals.  Where Johathan Demme just gathered information from technical consultants.  Just like how so many people praise a artist's later work more than the eariler work, it's the true critics and fans who can point out the least popular is the better work.  And with MANHUNTER and SILENCE, I found both MANHUNTER and SILENCE to be great suspenseful films, but I would give MANHUNTER more of the better edge.  ***** (out of five)",Manhunter
129,Alex-372,"Fascinating, mesmerizing movie",9,3 February 2002,"Based on Thomas Harris' novel Red Dragon, the first of Harris' books featuring Hannibal Lecter, this is a highly accomplished movie of the eighties from Michael Mann, director of Miami Vice (L.A. Takedown, The Keep).Starring William Petersen (CSI: Crime Scene Investigations, Fear) as Will Graham, a highly empathetic, burnt out detective (well, more than burnt out - Lecter practically disemboweled him during his arrest), this movie is unique, fast paced, tense and highly styleful. Graham is put on the trail of a serial killer, referred to as ""The Tooth Fairie"", as he has an unusual bite and sodomises his male victims after slaying entire families. He arranges the woman for some purpose that's left unexplained, but which has to do with the William Blake painting ""The Great Red Dragon And The Woman Clothed In The Sun"" (read the book for that one). This is all in the first ten minutes, by the way.The movie slows down when halfway when it turns into a character study of the serial killer. Some people will like that, some won't. It does take away from the pace of the movie as a whole, but it also adds depth to the motivations and creates an empathy with his next victims; it doesn't change the fact that the first and last thirds of the movie, which focus on the investigation, are highly engaging. I guess the director was trying to inject some of the deeper material of the book (an impossibility).As a serial killer who seems to be totally led by his intuitions, The Tooth Fairy is _very_ scary, because you're truly never sure what he will do next. He also seems to possess near super-natural strength when he's in his psychotic mode. Unpredictability is something director Mann seems to have mastered working on Miami Vice, and the movie has a lot of the feel of that series.Watch the movie, then read the book, then watch the movie again. A classic of the genre, and highly recommended.",Manhunter
130,blakiepeterson,A Stylish But Aloof Serial Killer Thriller,6,30 May 2015,"I've always admired Michael Mann's ability to make even the darkest of crime movies emit a neon, martini-sweet glow. He can shock us, disturb us, magnetize us; but all traumas are wrapped up in a quasi-cool package, kept swirling around in pulp noir fantasy. Recurring in Mann's films, or at least the ones I've seen, is the persistent distinction that, while the atmosphere may look like a colorized ""Kiss Me Deadly"", something much, much bleaker lurks beneath the surface.Esteem goes much farther than an emotional connection when it comes to a Mann picture: like Lynch's ""Lost Highway"" or Antonioni's ""Red Desert"", sitting back and getting lost in the thickly spread luster is much easier a task than walking out of the theater moved, tears streaming down our faces from the penetrative emotions thrown about left and right. We're left cold, drowning in the sorrows of the characters, suffocated by the elusive sheen of Mann's camera-work. ""Manhunter"", a thriller that initially introduced the world to Hannibal Lecter (rebranded Lecktor here), is a rather aloof serial killer suspense drama, murderous in its tension but icy in its pathos.William Petersen plays Will Graham, a retired FBI profiler lying low after a gruesome attack by cannibalistic murderer Hannibal Lecktor (Brian Cox). His resting period is cut rather short, however, when he is approached by his former superior (Dennis Farina), who is in desperate need of help. A new serial killer, billed ""The Tooth Fairy"", is wreaking havoc on the area, slaughtering families at random in hopes to attain some sort of mental catharsis. With Graham's chilling ability to put himself into the mind of the person under investigation, he very well could be a valuable asset. So reluctantly, knowing he could very well end future killings, he accepts the blood-stained invitation, aided by the now-jailed Lecktor.The interest ""Manhunter"" provides steadily increases, especially after it introduces The Tooth Fairy himself (spoiler warning). As Francis Dollarhyde, Tom Noonan is convincingly disturbed, so much so that we see him as a psychologically scarred monster, not a two- dimensional one that so many serial killer based movies provide us with. He is a victim of a neglectful society; all he ever wanted was for someone to like him. I suppose the most problematic fixture in ""Manhunter"" is Dollarhyde; he is the only character that holds immense interest. Noonan is so dedicated, so expressive that we fear that reading too much into his performance would ruin his startlingly effective capacity to freak us the f-ck out. Petersen, on the other hand, is much too understated to be believably haunted by his past, while Kim Greist and Joan Allen, two magnificent actresses, are wasted in roles too small to go anywhere. But the film is dripping with style, and when the writing fails to move, the cinematography takes the spotlight and galvanizes what's left of glass-littered-on-the-ground reality. Mann's excessive tinting works well here: dark blues wash out scenes of comfort, of love; greens, pinks, and oranges hint at imminent threat. Even the score, mostly consisting of synthetic, distinctly '80s mood pieces, heighten Mann's hallucinogenic embellishments.""Manhunter"" is entertainment of the highest quality, subversively stylish, intelligently directed; but it remains so brisk, so distant, that even the slimmest thrill is brought to entirely new levels because it somehow feels more hospitable than everything coming before its insertion.",Manhunter
131,datorsiers2,Decent on its own,7,6 December 2015,"Being the first movie of the Hannibal Lecter franchise it does a decent job, but what bothers me the most is that Lecter merely gets any screen time and Brian Cox has a weak performance if you ask me, people tend to praise Cox for his job in ""Manhunter"", but i prefer Anthony Hopkins, his performances are exactly what made ""The Silence of the Lambs'' gain such a massive cult following and interested people in further movies.Maybe people just love this movie so much, because as always, it is the first installment? I don't base my reviews on whether it was the first film, the second or the third and etcetera. It does not have the suspenseful vibe, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" had. Maybe i am not being a 100% objective, just because i think it gets largely conquered by its so called sequel.

132,Tiger_Mark,Perhaps the best movie of the Harris novels.,10,15 July 2002,"This was a really terrific film. So dark and so creepy, yet so cool and hip at the same time. Michael Mann is without a doubt, one of the finest directors ever. This would be the first of the three Thomas Harris stories dealing with Hannibal Lechter, although in this film, Lechter is more of a minor player. By the way, in this film Hannibal is played by Brian Cox and his performance is incredible. Cox is creepy and disturbing, the way he should be, instead of the over the top way he was played by Hopkins. The movie deals with FBI agent Will Graham, a retired FBI agent that in his prime, had the ability to get into the minds of serial killers and interpret why they did certain things. This helped him to catch the monsters and put them away. Sadly, living in the minds of monsters can have a very negative effect on your own life. Graham has trouble getting the images out of his head and he is forced into retirement.  However, there is a serial killer called the ""Tooth Fairy"" that is murdering entire families while they sleep and the FBI is stumped. Once again Graham is pressured into coming out of retirement and prompted to get back into the mind of this maniac destroying families. This film was made in the mid-1980's, while Mann was still very much involved in his TV show ""Miami Vice"" and you can see some (many) similarities. The music, dress and sets are very Art Deco. Sonny Crockett never makes an appearance, but you might expect to see him. I have always felt that this was arguably the best movie of the three books (it was the best book for sure). ""Silence.."" was excellent as well (also a great book). However, ""Hannibal"" was one of the worst movies ever made (the book was rotten as well). Sadly, the studio decided to re-name the movie ""Manhunter"" instead of ""Red Dragon"" at the last minute, which commercially killed the film. Many Harris readers did not know that this movie was based on the book. However, Mann makes the most of it by directing a great film. I see now, that the studios are re-making this film with a big budget and cast. I don't think it necessary. They ought to re-make ""Hannibal."" **** out of **** for Red Dragon, I mean Manhunter.",Manhunter

He makes you feel for his character, and you get the sense that his way of getting into the mind of a killer really troubles him. Brian Cox plays Hannibal, and I think he does a good job, but the film isn't really about him so he's not in it a whole lot. Tom Noonan does a great job as the main villain. He's slightly sympathetic but also insane. The whole cast is great and it makes it interesting to watch. Even though I loved it, I acknowledge some issues. There were some weird editing flaws in the climactic ending, which stood out to me. Also, some things in the plot seem to appear, and then kind of disappear and never get mentioned again, like the main villain knowing where Will lives. Threatening and serious at first, but then kinda fades away, and when you get to know the villain more, it doesn't even seem like he had the intention of doing anything to Will's family.

139,Kirasjeri,MARVELOUS and STYLISH - Simply Great,9,22 June 2002,"So, Ridley Scott, fresh from the gratuitous and sickening gore of that travesty ""Hannibal"", is for some reason remaking ""Manhunter"". Perhaps we can expect more gross-out violence more suitable for an ""Itchy and Scratchy"" cartoon on ""The Simpsons"". But there is no reason to remake a near-masterpiece, other than to CASH in on the Hannibal Lecter cachet.Michael Mann, of ""Miami Vice"" fame, wrote the screenplay, and directed it in a very stylish and effective manner. The plot and characters were well developed throughout. The acting was superlative, with a luminous Joan Allen standing out as the blind romantic interest - and almost victim - of the crazed serial killer who is an ""avid fan"" of Hannibal.Tom Noonan was equally good as the killer; he was fabulously menacing, spooky, and yet affecting in a sad sort of way. The climactic scene shows him finding his humanity with the Allen character - just before William F. Peterson jumps into the scene. Peterson is reprising his role as a crime scene profiler on TV's ""CSI"". Brian Cox is OK as Dr Lecter, and Dennis Farina fine as the FBI chief.This movie works on so many levels, and even the music is perfectly suited: Ina Gadda Da Vida by Iron Butterfly was ideal for that climax.Simply a wonderful movie - in NO need of a remake.",Manhunter
140,K-Slicer,Not a classic...unless you're comparing it to a pile of brown smelly stuff,3,20 February 2005,"I don't know where to begin with this piece of unadulterated schlock. I didn't watch this movie entirely but I did watch most of it. There is too much to complain about in this movie to care about it. I only liked this movie because I saw my favorite CSI character playing a similar sort of role and that is only one of three reasons I like this movie. William Petersen is a decent actor on the small screen, I don't know about the big screen though. He tried way too hard in this unintentional joke of a movie. I like the scene where the killer had the one FBI agent tied to the wheelchair. I didn't expect the agent to become a fireball while traveling back to his car. Michael Mann can write a good-intentioned torture scene, that is if you want to intentionally torture yourself. In my mind, I don't why anybody likes Michael Mann or any of the stuff he creates. He squandered one too many opportunities for some stars to shine and it drove me bonkers. Dennis Farina wasn't able to pull off any of his trademark irony and Brian Cox couldn't muster any creepiness to save his performance. As somebody astutely pointed out, Michael Mann was trying to make Miami Vice on the big screen. I believe he blew half the flipping budget on the set decor. It was heart-wrenching to watch this film. If you liked this movie, you should be ashamed with yourself. As for this movie, it gets a score of 3.Here ends my rant!",Manhunter
141,imagiking,Manhunter: A Functional Thriller,6,3 March 2010,"The first and lesser-known attempt at bringing Thomas Harris' Red Dragon to the screen, Manhunter was the film which originally introduced the cinematic world to Dr Hannibal Lecter.The film follows William Graham, an FBI agent tasked with tracking down a dangerous serial killer labelled ""The Tooth Fairy"". Returning from recovery having been attacked in the process of capturing Lecter, Graham struggles to deal with the stress of his work and the threat of a ticking clock.The first striking thing in the film is the colour: the perfect white innocence of the home we soon see tarnished in blood; the pale blue serenity of Graham's bedroom. From the outset we see Manhunter as a well shot movie, its palette one of its most appealing and enthralling facets. We get into the plot without delay, William Peterson effectively showing his character's fragility following his recent incident. Both hero and villain are well played, showing us the torn monstrous side of the former and human side of the latter in a manner which leads us to question their similarities, seeing elements of each in the other. Everything plays out with a satisfactory supporting cast and a sufficiently entertaining plot. There is a complaint to be made about some of Graham's lines, the repeated over-acting with which Peterson curses the ""bastard"" and ""son of a bitch"" a little irritating. Apart from this drawback, the film suffers from no major flaws, though I found myself lost as to how certain developments had been made at some stages. It is hard to believe some of the case progression within the narrative. The ending, too, leaves a little to be desired, following a rather uninteresting formula.A functional thriller with an appealing image and the underlying interior struggle of its protagonist, Manhunter delivers what it promises.",Manhunter
142,thehumanduvet,"Good killer thriller, but no Silence of the Lambs",8,23 February 2001,"Michael Mann's earlier stab at a Hannibal Lector picture is a very moody, atmospheric serial killer thriller with all the traditional elements - cop drawn unwillingly out of retirement, deadline for the next gruesome murder drawing ever closer, bizarre motivations and actions from the killer - building to a gripping and exciting finale. However, taken as a companion piece to the later Silence of the Lambs it suffers badly by comparison. Brian Cox has a go at Hannibal but doesn't really get much chance to shine; he has a much smaller part than Hopkins gets in the later film and doesn't really do much with it, other than looking vaguely menacing. His back story is only mentioned briefly and in passing and as an actor, though very fine, Cox doesn't exude the ruthless intelligence and intensity Hopkins manages to display with every tiny glance and motion. That aside however this is an excellent film with many interesting angles on the genre, which was pretty scarcely represented at the time but is now churning them out like there's no tomorrow, mostly due to Harris' more successfully filmed sequel to the book on which this is based. The baddy gives a genuinely chilling and moving portrayal of a really messed up individual, and the main star William Petersen (where'd he go?) is great as the quietly intense, dedicated fed of the title who just wants to pack it in and get away from all the sickness of serial crime. Good stuff, but shown up a little by its greater successor.",Manhunter
143,FrankBooth_DeLarge,"Very creepy, not quite as good as Silence of the Lambs though",9,27 January 2005,"Manhunter was the first movie that involved the now extremely famous Hannibal Lecter. That's probably what this film will always be remembered for, having a different Hannibal Lecter. Brian Cox plays him in this movie, the scene he's in has plenty of psychological suspense, but he isn't as convincing as Anthony Hopkins was. In this movie Hannibal is a minimal character. The movie is about retired F.B.I. agent Will Graham(played by CSI's William Peterson). He decides to help out with one last case, the case of the terrifying serial killer known as the tooth fairy.The tooth fairy is a serial killer who seems to have a random method for selecting his victims, and the aftermath of his killings is very disturbing. In order to solve all of this, Will Graham goes to the imprisoned Hannibal Lecter(or Lecktor as spelled in this movie) and tries to figure out his method and track down the killer.Manhunter is based on the novel The RED Dragon and the movie The Red Dragon is a more up to date version of this movie. Despite the excellent qualities of the film, it seems rather dated due to some of the primitive technology that was used in the 1980's. Still a very good movie with some neat 1980's style music. Not quite as good as Silence of the Lambs, but this film is good for what it is.",Manhunter
144,AlabamaWorley1971,A personal fave!,9,8 June 2000,"Sure, it kind of looks like a long MIAMI VICE episode, but once you get past that, you'll find one of the most involving thrillers of the last 20 years. William Petersen is excellent as Will Graham. My favorite device is how Will starts out his profile addressing the killer in the third person (""The house must have felt cool to him""), then moves to the second (""You stood here and watched them""), but it's only when he lets himself move to the first person (""I enter the house"") that the solution becomes clear. It's a journey that he doesn't want to make, but he knows it's the only way to find this guy before he kills again. Brian Cox is excellent as Lecter (you have to love the phone trick); it's too bad he wasn't brought on for SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. Might have sent his career into overdrive. The best sequence is the analysis of the Tooth Fairy's letter to Lecter at the lab. See if you can spot all the present-day TV stars! I count 3: the dad from LIFE GOES ON and Bletcher from the late lamented MILLENNIUM; Bulldog from FRASIER; and Chris Elliott, who now voices Dogbert on the DILBERT animated series!",Manhunter
145,vonnoosh,Preferring the Director's Cut,10,22 June 2021,"I always thought the story about the man who captures Lecktor is more interesting than anything about Hannibal Lecktor. Im going with the spelling for this movie and I agree with the top reviewer, Brian Cox's portrayal in alot of ways is superior to Hopkins. To say the least, he is memorable in the role despite not playing it much. Hannibal as by Cox is someone who is quickly dismissive of anyone he deems inferior to himself. He doesn't waste time on conversation and quickly makes his own deductions based on his observations. He may have read about what became of Graham since he nearly killed him but it took him no time to learn why Graham visited him. As Graham said in a scene, it was to regain the mindset of a psychotic.Will Graham was a successful hunter of serial killers because he tried to think like them in order to anticipate their next move. The director's cut has an oddly ambiguous run up to the closing credits which underscores the dangers of doing this for Graham who quit the FBI feeling he was having trouble escaping the mindset. The theatrical release has a straight up good guy versus bad guy type ending.Michael Mann's work had a dreamy dark energy to it in those days. It comes across strong in this movie and in Thief. Many key scenes unfold with no dialogue, just music and visuals telling the story. There is no better filmmaking than being able to achieve that goal effectively.The remake misses the point completely while pretending to be closer to the original novel. Graham instead is lowered to the level of an aspiring FBI agent with no experience who seriously seeks advice from Lecktor which makes no sense at all. That leaves several massive plotholes.",Manhunter
146,mattrochman,If you have seen red dragon avoid this,5,13 August 2006,"I was looking forward to this film. I loved Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs (hated Hannibal). Wanted to see how it was done in the 1980s.Well to describe manhunter, I need to draw on a line in Coming to America: ""Good and terrible."" I was surprised at the interpretation of Lecter in this version. He was particularly chilling and realistic. Hopkins was more of an over-cooked Hollywood-esq version of Lecter. But I think Hopkins wins out in the wash up.The problem with this film is that it is very dated and the chill-factor isn't quite there. Further, Peterson does a serviceable job as Wil Graham, but certainly ain't Ed Norton. The other supporting cast and the script were a mixture of a dated 1980s with a taste of the corny late-1970s. All in all.... not bad for a 1980s flick. Is fairly gripping on its own and a pretty good casual watch. The directing was under done to some degree (I assume Mann was less experienced at that point of his career) and the editing was slightly off.But Red Dragon is a remake of this film and Red Dragon is far more superior. When I say remake, you'll notice a number of scenes that were almost redone word for word in Red Dragon - but with far more genuine intensity and credibility from the fantastic cast.So for those who saw this first, I'm happy if you feel that it was fantastic for its time. But if you've seen Red Dragon and you're thinking that you'll have a look at this, just to see what the original was like, save your money - cos it really ain't that great these days.",Manhunter
147,Derek237,An excellent psychological thriller,8,30 August 2003,"Like many people, I saw Silence of The Lambs first and discovered Manhunter during the ten year void before Hannibal, anxious to see another Lecter film. If your main reason to see this film is Lecter, don't bother with it. Because when I first saw it I watched it up until Lecter and just gave up on it. That was a stupid thing to do, and a few months later when I rented it again, I loved it. I've watched it over and over since then, and it gets even better each time around.For this movie alone I have finally accepted Brian Cox as Hannibal. Of course I liked Anthony Hopkins better, but I still like Cox's take on Lecter. He plays him as actually pretty charming, which makes it all the more unnerving when people talk about the things he's done. But I don't know why I'm focusing so much on Lecter, he has only 3 scenes, the true star is Will Graham, played by William Peterson. It's amazing how well they made this character get into mind of the killer. There's this great scene in the last half hour or so (probably my favourite)where he visits the house of a murdered family and re-enacts the killer's thoughts. Not his crime, but his thoughts.Tom Noonan is great too, as the killer. He isn't exactly a terrific actor, but he has the look and facial expressions down perfectly. He looks a lot like what this killer would look like. Tall, awkward, emotionally fragile. There is a spectacular shootout at the end with ""inna godda da vida"" playing, and the slow motion shots and jump cuts (intentional or not) give it a great surreal feel.Manhunter is one of the best psychological thrillers I've ever seen, it has many twists and turns, but more importantly it has heart and very interesting characters that all have depth. Don't compare this to Silence Of The Lambs or Red Dragon, it's great on its own and some may even consider it superior to them.My rating: 8/10",Manhunter
148,walsh-22,A superior film,10,3 May 2007,"I had seen Silence of the Lambs before Manhunter. In fact, I had never heard of Manhunter till one late night while I was in University, flicking through the channels and this caught my eye and after I watched it, it became one of my favourite films and I became a fan of William Petersen's work.I can't understand people saying the book 'Red Dragon' is better than the film. No offence to Thomas Harris but I found Red Dragon boring and couldn't get into it. I even found myself comparing Manhunter with the remake starring Edward Norton and Harvey Keitel and found it lacking. I just couldn't get into it and the actors were rubbish and there were first rate actors in the film.This film was one of the first films to deal with profiling and it was a fairly new technique when the film came out. Up till then, crime films were the police looking at the evidence and being able to tell who had done it because the killers were caught red handed either leaving their prints behind or eyewitnesses seeing them at the scene of the crime but then more and more crimes happened where there was no connection between the victim and killer that the police could see and so they needed profilers to help with the more complex cases and they could build a profile on the type of person the killer was by looking at the crime scenes and the victims and using the profile to catch the killers.Some people knock William Petersen's acting but I think he is one of the best actors I have seen. His character Will Graham is a tortured soul who struggles to get past what happened to him when he was pursuing Hannibal Lecktor. He is now called out of retirement to hunt a serial killer called The Tooth Fairy who is stalking and killing families. Graham has to once again get into the mind of a killer and stop this man before any more families are killed and he has to do it without destroying himself like he nearly did with Lecktor. When he meets Lecktor, you can still see the power Lecktor still has over him. Brian Cox is just as good as Anthony Hopkins as Lecktor. He is understated in the way he talks and moves but you can see it in his face with sends chills down your spine as you see him toy with Graham. Tom Noonan as the Tooth Fairy/Francis Dollarhyde is convincingly scary but manages to show a vulnerability in the character at the same time.What I found interesting was the relationship between Reba, a blind girl and Francis. I wondered if she would be able to stop his murderous impulses and Francis would have some form of redemption but it doesn't happen and the madness takes over. But it is obvious that she has touched some part of him that none of his other victims have as he hesitates to kill her at the end.Another appeal to the film is that Will has already established a career in the F.B.I and after all the experience he had, found it hard to get out of Lecktor's head but we see him get more determined to catch the Tooth Fairy and in having to deal with things he didn't want to at the start of the film, ironically it makes him better mentally. It is also fascinating to see Will as a family man because we see how his job affects his family as well as him.Michael Mann is one of the best directors. He never slows the pace and keeps the audiences attention on the screen till the very end and by then you feel like you have ridden a white knuckle rollarcoaster. Brian Cox said in an interview about Mann, he implies horror but never explains it and that is more scary as the audience are left to imagine what has gone on. The editing and special effects ain't brilliant but for one thing it was the 80's, for another, I also heard that the film was behind schedule and on the last night where the shootout between Francis and the police happened, there was no special effects guys around.The action and music just go well together, like a puzzle.For anyone who hasn't watched it, just do it because I think it is one of the best out of the franchise with brilliant actors who you can recognise in other films and TV series who weren't well known back when this was getting made but whose careers have flourished since the making of the film.",Manhunter
149,nixskits,Michael Mann's profiles in madness,9,26 November 2009,"Before the term ""profiling"" entered the popular imagination as a crime fighting technique and a long time before television shows reduced the efforts of the FBI's best and brightest to stupid and unrealistic catch-the-killer-before-the-last-commercial plots, ""Manhunter"" came along like a boulder landing on a roach. This exploration of open wounds in society is not for the squeamish or those seeking paint by numbers stories. It's a wild bull of a film and William Petersen is just the right man to take us into his character's indelible line of work.J. Edgar Hoover would have regarded profiling as little more than witchcraft, so the most valuable contributions the post-Hoover FBI have given the world since the mid 70's include the art/science of really finding out what makes violent criminals tick and using this to try and predict their next moves, undoubtedly saving more lives than anyone can say with mere statistics. A serial murderer such as Ted Bundy or Jeffrey Dahmer could go on wreaking havoc until they are A: put in prison or B: die themselves. The remorseless offender who exists to kill doesn't function like a normal felon. Their business is a much more deranged and secret activity than gangs or bank robbery. They blend into society scarily well most of the time, as Michael Moore's ""TV Nation"" displayed in a grimly comical piece on how folks in a typical suburb didn't bat an eyelid while the show's crew put out some very bizarre signals that something wasn't so ""normal"" in their community. The person who's overhearing you discuss the latest news about a ripped from the headlines crime might just be the crazy killer!Brian Cox wasn't the first actor cast in the role of Hannibal. According to Mann's commentary track on the Divimax version of this film he personally supervised, Brian Dennehy (who later starred as John Wayne Gacy) was going to play the discredit to psychiatry until he said Cox should have the part. And Cox provides a disturbingly low key take on the shrink the world would become much better acquainted with five years later. Joan Allen is in top form as a woman who's much more free spirited than the visually unchallenged men she's around. As is Tom Noonan, the unhinged suitor who has delusional eyes for her. The song ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" gets it's best use ever here in a scene that has to be seen! (Slayer also recorded a version of this Iron Butterfly classic, briefly heard in ""Less Than Zero"".) The remake ""Red Dragon"" is fresher in many minds than this original take on the Thomas Harris series of novels that inspired a zillion nightmares. And in the 90's, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and the ""CSI"" franchise became the pop culture standards for most people's ideas about elite law enforcement. But I prefer ""Manhunter"", for Mann's direction and those performances that stare back at your soul unwaveringly.",Manhunter

What exactly do you get from this experience? Action? Very little. Romance? Actually yes (far too much of it).
Scares? No. Not any to be had. The soundtrack saps all the films seriousness and sounds like starsky and hutch. This film is just like Heat in alot of ways and that is not a good thing. Epic fail michael mann, but lucky for him noone had seen silence of the lambs yet..",Manhunter
151,Ben-Hibburd,Manhunter - Michael Mann.,10,18 September 2015,"Manhunter is adapted from Thomas Harris's novel Red Dragon. It's director Michael Mann's third feature film. After receiving critical acclaim from his fantastic debut Thief(1981), and then having a critical flop with the divisive The Keep(1983) this film marks a return to top form. Manhunter starts out with a man eerily creeping up a flight of stairs about to commit a heinous act of violence. Which is made all the more tense with a piercing synth score and just In the split second of it happening, Mann cuts to Jack Crawford(Dennis farina) the agent-in-Charge of the Behavioural Science Unit of the FBI. Who is trying to coax out Will Graham(William Petersen), a former agent with the FBI, who retired with after a run in with the infamous serial killer Hannibal Lektor.Crawford knows that he can play on the emotions of Will Graham, who has the ability to empathise with psychopaths and killers, an ability he finds extremely disturbing. After showing him pictures of the two dead families both of which were murdered a month apart on a full moon, he reluctantly agrees to track down the 'Tooth Fairy' played by Tom Noonan, which leads him needing to get back into the mindset, he pays a visit to Dr.Lecktor, expertly played by Brian Cox. Where the psychological sparring begins.As with most Mann films, his films are based around two men who are the opposite side of the same coin. In Heat(1995) we got a thief called McCauley played by DeNiro, and a cop called Hanna played by Al Paicino, both characters who were self aware that they were the same person, but on different sides of the law. In Manhunter there is a similar undertone, we see Will Graham struggling with his ability too understand and even empathise with the serial killer he's chasing after. On the other Francis Dolarhyde who yearns for a normal life which he tires to have with Reba McClane(Joan Allen).The acting in this film is marvellous with a great central performance from William Petersen who gives an intense brooding performance. He sells every emotion he conveys on the screen. His counterpart Tom Noonan also does a terrific job of taking what could of been a one note character in the 'Tooth Fairy' and turns him into a believable and compelling character, that hates what he's doing but believes he has no choice.The un-doubted star of the film though is Michael Mann, his aesthetics are visually stunning to look at and add another layer to this film that is oozing in style. While the film is product of it's time, there is something very appealing to it's synthetic score and art deco design. One drawback of the film is that it suffers from a shaky final confrontation, which Is evident as Mann clearly ran out of budget by this point of the film. which unfortunately feels like a bit a let down after all the hard work the first two acts put in place. Overall It still remains a fantastic thriller, which spawned numerous copycats. It's a film worth investing your time in.",Manhunter
152,ericjg623,"Scarier than ""Lambs"" ...",9,19 November 2001,"This movie is basically the prequel to ""Silence of the Lambs"". It received nowhere near as much attention, nor any Academy Awards, but nonetheless, as a purely scary movie, it is the better of the two. Hannibal Lecter isn't as memorable, nor as well acted, but he's more real, more frightening. Unlike in SOTL, he is a direct threat to the principal good guy, in that he nearly killed FBI agent Will Graham and drove him to near madness. Graham is the man responsible for capturing Lecter, but to do so, he had to get further inside Lecter's head than is safe for sane humans, and throughout the film we fear that he, in pursuit of a new serial killer, is in grave danger of losing his sanity in the process. To add to the terror, Lecter is playing his mind games, while supposedly helping Graham, he is also secretly in cahoots with the killer, known only as the ""tooth fairy"". Aside from dealing with the physical and psychological dangers presented by Lecter, Graham must also try to reconstruct the mindset of the killer, and this provides the real drama of this film. He is a man on the edge, he's been through psychological hell thanks to Lecter and wants nothing more than to live in peace with his wife and son, but when his old boss Jack Crawford enlists his help, showing him photos of the murdered families, he cannot refuse. And throughout the entire film we are drawn into his struggle, the battle between his unique genius for seeing into the minds of psychotic serial killers versus his desire to maintain his sanity, protect his family, and simply lead a normal life. As such, Graham is a far more compelling character than was Jodie Foster's Agent Starling. Although this movie has its flaws (chiefly, a ""Miami Vice"" like reliance on its music soundtrack) it is a genuinely frightening psychological thriller that is definitely more scary than its more famous and critically acclaimed successor.",Manhunter

154,antonjsw1,Suspenseful and stylish thriller - but this is not a Hannibal Lecter movie,9,7 April 2012,"Building on the visual style established in the excellent Thief, director Mann further cements his distinctive look with this slick, atmospheric and polished film, that is only marred by underdevelopment of some of the supporting characters.The plot is fairly straightforward but interesting. William Peterson puts a refreshing take on the Will Graham character by playing him in a very controlled and dispassionate way. This approach allows his relationship with his wife, played by Kim Griest to pursue some interesting dynamics. However, this is very much the B plot, as the focus on the film is Will Graham's attempt to track down a ruthless serial killer, scarily played by Tom Noonan using the less is more school of acting. He is perfect casting and his physique is absolutely spot on for the role. There is effective support from Joan Allen (as a blind Reba McClane), Dennis Farina as FBI investigator Jack Crawford and of course Brian Cox with a very different (but still interesting) take on Hannibal Lecter, in much more of a supporting role.However, I did wish that some of the character's backgrounds could have been fleshed out more. I never quite felt that the connection between Lecter and Graham was as strong as it needed to be. Also it would be been better to have seen more of Stephen Lang's amusing (if slightly over the top) tabloid journalist character's prior relationship to Graham.Dante Spinotti's photography is impressive, and the Mann's choice of music works well in the film, although it would have been interesting to see what Tangerine Dream would have done, as I felt they could have produced another excellent score. Mann integrates all the elements with the same precision as on Thief, resulting in a slick, atmospheric, tense and enjoyable, if slightly aloof film.",Manhunter

The ending has some real editing problems and characters doing some pretty dumb crap. Don't believe the new found hype behind this one. I know they cut a lot of stuff out of this but i don't think that would have made it any better. If ever a movie needed a remake it was indeed this one and Red Dragon is great.,Manhunter
157,kira02bit,Forgettable adaptation that plays like a Miami Vice episode,4,5 July 2015,"Given the huge popularity associated with the character and world of Thomas Harris's cannibalistic erudite serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lector, it seems only fitting to go back and revisit the film that first brought Lector - rather forgettably - to the screen. Manhunter based on Harris's acclaimed novel Red Dragon was originally released back in 1986 and documents the hunt for a serial killer code-named The Tooth Fairy by dogged FBI agent Will Graham. If this story sounds familiar and you have not read the novel, then perhaps you saw the remake from a few years ago, which featured Anthony Hopkins reprising his Oscar-winning role of Lector. The remake - which keeps the name of the novel Red Dragon - is actually far more faithful to the book, more coherent and suspenseful, was a bigger box office hit, and features a far better cast, but because filmmaker Michael Mann's name is associated with its predecessor everyone must pretend that the remake is somehow inferior.Arguably the biggest problem I have with Manhunter (then and now) is that it plays less like a cinematic thriller than an over-extended episode of Mann's then hugely popular TV series Miami Vice. The photography, jarring synthetic pop music score and visual tricks are all staples of Vice. The stop-and-start pacing are also a trademark of Vice, and what worked OK in an hour long TV show does not work well at all in a feature length film. The film lurches from scene to scene rather than flows and, as such, generates precious little suspense. We get very little feel for the characters involved and thus develop little to no concern with who makes it out alive. If anything, Mann's directorial style here is a huge detraction and the material suffers for it.William Petersen snags the lead role of Will Graham. Petersen was supposed to be made a star by the previous To Live and Die in LA, but no one noticed him. Here he makes another stab and it is a thoroughly lifeless performance filled with too-cool-for-the-room posturing. There is no vulnerability or personality to his character. Petersen would need to wait a while before his role on TV's CSI would make him a household name and that was only because he finally was able to inject some humor and quirkiness to his acting rather than the empty brooding he does here. Tom Noonan is almost of no consequence as the Tooth Fairy. He generates little in the way of fear or sympathy, and gives us no insight into his character. He comes across as a lesser Miami Vice villain that Crockett and Tubbs would have disposed of within 60 minutes. Kim Greist is wasted in the nothing role of Graham's wife and Joan Allen trots out every cliché in the book as a blind woman who is initially the Tooth Fairy's girlfriend then potential target. Contrasting her to the later Emily Watson who brought a no-bull earthiness to the part, Allen does not compare favorably.British actor Brian Cox gets the task of essaying the role of Lector here. There are film elites who insist that this is the definitive take on the part and better than Anthony Hopkins more celebrated turn. When I watched the film back in 1986, I found the scenes with Cox's Lector to be pointless and almost brutally boring. Cox's Lector is cold aloof and nearly devoid of personality or charisma. Your eyes start wandering away from the screen and it is difficult to understand why this tiresome character is taking up even minimal screen time. By contrast, Hopkins' Lector is charismatic, bold, chilling and charming. Someone who is endlessly fascinating yet you would never want to meet him in a dark alley. In short, there simply is no comparison to which performance dominates the screen.In 1986, Manhunter received middling to good reviews, but came and went in an eye blink. It remained largely forgotten until director Michael Mann developed some serious cinematic feats to his resume and Harris's work became prime material thanks to The Silence of the Lambs, then everyone attempted to go back and rehabilitate it into something its not...like very good. Even re-watching it today, it is a film that sacrifices story, suspense and character to the kind of brooding, faux-cool late 1980s nonsense that was already wearing thin at that time.",Manhunter
158,butravi,"Dated, over praised, 80's junk",3,23 October 2020,"I watched manhunter, after silence of the lambs and red dragon movies. Watched it because there was so many great reviews about it on IMDb user reviews. Ratings were around 8 to 10, with words like ""best Hannibal portrayal"" etc. Totally disappointed after watching mindhunter.
First shock will be 80's loud music in background, trashy way to create suspense..
Second, pace of the movie, where most interesting scenes are rushed through, and then scenes with nothing much happening drag through at very slow pace. (Probably an 80's trick used by directors, but very dated to anyone from 21st century.
Third, Hannibal lector by Brian Cox has very less screen time, and if you have seen silence of the lambs, then totally disappointing. None of the characteristics of Hannibal is portrayed, and script writer and director had no idea of the importance of this character. Dumb!
Don't know why so many amazing reviews are there, but this film is nowhere near a classic. It's mostly a waste of time. The story is not close to the book, red dragon is closer to the book as well.
And please post review if you see any over rated movie in future.",Manhunter
159,jelencesb,Honestly,5,27 December 2020,"As someine who v first seen Silence of the Lambs and subsequent movies, as well as Hannibal series, I couldnt bring myself to appreciate the movie.Hannibal was not that much a psycho we are used to. Too much time of the 2 hours, how long the movie lasts, was spent on trivialities, too much just running around like this is a movie about pro runners and not about two prolific serial killers. No tones nor undertknes of terror at all endorsed throughout the movie and from my oerspective as an avid Hannibal fan, everything felt too forceful. The only watchable, non boring and genuine scenes were Reba/Francis.
I didnt ""feel"" this movie at all.MAYBE it was amazing back in the 90s but this was maybe some kind of police procedural/romance movie, it didnt give the Hannibal, Red Dragon and serial killers vibe at all.",Manhunter

The people who praise Manhunter as being a great film and even BETTER than Silence of the Lambs of Red Dragon are the same people that say that CCR's version of ""Proud Mary"" is better than Ike and Tina Turner's.  Please!  Manhunter was a terrible movie.  If I wouldn't have seen Red Dragon, I wouldn't have been able to follow it.  Lector was hardly in the movie at all, and was not captivating at all.  He seemed like just an average schlub in a cell.  Hopkins' Lector draws you in and engages you in his sick genius.  Nothing like that here. Dolarhyde's character wasn't developed at all either, not like in Red Dragon anyway.  Whoever sings the praises of this movie has not seen good film, and they certainly haven't seen Red Dragon.  6/10",Manhunter

No, not as much as HALLOWEEN but still... that Toothfairy guy Tom Noonan really freaked me out!!! Heck, he made Brian Cox's Hannibal Lector look like a boyscout in comparison. But I love the 80s vibe of the whole thing, I love the fact that the star is pre-CSI William Petersen and not an A-list Hollywood star (this gives the film a more genuine and realistic feel), I love the Michael Mann style here - this was his Miami VICE peak of creativity. The music is pure 80s! Again, the content is a bit disturbing in spots but the mood is really effective here. Kudos to Mann for creating that mood/style. I noticed a similar style in THIEF (helped greatly by the Tangerine Dream score) - I think Mann really knew what he was doing in the 80s.Overall not really my cup of tea but at least it's not as ridiculously overrated as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.

An archetypal film in its way, very well done, crisp and clinical and full of emotional tension. I also liked the background and lesser known elements of the soundtrack. Seeing William Peterson 17 years before CSI is a pleasure. He has great screen presence. The actor playing Hannibal Lector (COX) is believably brilliant, unlike the later versions performed by Hopkins, which while engrossing, are over the top as far as believability go. This is a movie which cuts to the basics, a twisted mind, another mind which is capable of plumbing the depths but not without pain, and lots of personality variations. GREAT STORY.",Manhunter

Now, his former, boss Jack Crawford, wants Will back to profile the so-called Tooth Fairy (cops can be so cruel) killer.What follows is Will investigating the crime scenes and starting to think like the killer, slowly going crazy and losing touch with his family along the way. This is a truly fascinating and compelling process.This is Will's movie all the way. The killer isn't even introduced until the third act.Director Michael Mann does a fabulous job here. He combines 80s styles and music in such an authentic and non-distracting way, but a way in which you can definitely have a feel of the era. The culmination of this exists in the climatic finale (which I guess I'm the only one who liked).Mann has also assembled some of the best actors. Peterson gives a chillingly realistic performance as Graham, Brian Cox is positively psychotic as Lecktor, and Joan Allen is once again superb, this time playing a sympathetic blind woman.Remade as ""Red Dragon"" in 2002, but that lacked style, gave us a hammy Lecktor, and took the focus off of Graham.

169,mikelcat,The best of the bunch,8,24 February 2008,"This is in my opinion the best of the ''Hannibal'' films , because of the actors and the atmosphere created by Michael Mann . William Peterson is by far the best Will Graham , he looked the age the agent would be and projected a tortured soul at odds with his abilities better than E.Norton , who's good in his own right but miscast in that role . Brian Cox is superb as Lecktor , arrogant , damaged , manipulative the interaction between him and Graham was intense I wished there was more , but this film and the book is about Graham not Lecktor as are the subsequent films which exploit the serial killer craze . Also Tom Noonan as Frances was a better choice , tall and different looking , he projected a powerful misfit sans tattoos , they weren't needed . You can see the Miami Vice like touch for sure , but I think it works .What people don't seem to get is that serial killers don't scare you , they charm you , draw you in , thats why they get away with it for so long and why Cox's portrayal was so superior .If you compare the two films Hopkins portrayal is almost comedic , the voice he puts on sounds like a put on voice , while Cox who based his interpretation on British serial killer Peter Manuel was natural , still trying to irritate in his powerlessness .This is the one to see .",Manhunter
170,enigmaticmaniac,good acts and steady screenplay,7,21 September 2011,This one comes out in the 80's when Hannibal Lektor was unknown to the world. The movie seems boring in beginning but it stand to its ground soon after. Michael Mann has made it stylish in his own way with reference to the screenplay and the background score as well as music. The environment is always gripping to the theme. William has done a good job as Graham and is efficient in depicting the characteristics of the character. The role of Hannibal is very less and its not able to create the impact upto the mark. Its nice but not great. The character of Dollarhyde is rather more promising. On whole the movie is not great but its good and worth watch. The thrills are adequate as per the time it was released. Go for it if you like crime thrillers.,Manhunter

It has the stylish way of filming and use of light and music that made Miami Vice so great. The killer in this movie is perfectly picked out. Somehow everything works out so much better than the Hopkins version of Red Dragon. This movie is well set up, good music, good tempo, good story, very good acting, and the climax with the killer 'dismantled' while the almost full 17 minute version of Iron butterfly's is playing, should have made this movie much more world famous than it is!",Manhunter

173,daniel-kyle,"THE Original, and the ORIGINAL Lecter",10,5 January 2014,"When 'Silence of the Lambs' became a big hit in the early 90's, this 1986 original (from the novel ""Red Dragon"" by author Robert Harris - who also wrote such 70's thrillers as ""Black Sunday"") quickly became forgotten, especially its 80's 'Miami Vice' style, no doubt infused by Vice show runner Michael Mann: certainly, aside from Michael Bay, the most stylish of Hollywood directors. Also included is a short but key scene with character actor extraordinaire Brian Cox as the original Hannibal Lecter (here and in the book spelled Lecktor). His performance, as stated in another review, is better than Hopkins. Rather than reveal the plot - redone with Hopkins and Edward Norton as lead FBI consultant Will Graham some 20 years later at the tail end of the long series - I wish to instead focus on the novel (there were 4 others to follow which paralleled the movies). In the book, the author outlines the making of a serial killer to a great degree, so much that it could be a Criminology textbook. And, having taken Criminology, I must point out the only error in that he merges two distinct, but different, psychopathic profiles. It doesn't matter, as this IS fiction, unlike say 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', and it is perfect. I used to own the VHS tape, and cassette soundtrack (Excellent! With both pop songs and original musical compositions), however have lost both. I must buy the Blu Ray DVD soon, but there has been no CD release or otherwise of the soundtrack. Some of the songs can still be found on their respective artist's own catalogue, however. There is a great lead performance by William Petesen, later of CSI, which alone should have brought this into reissue sooner. There is also Chicago cop standby Dennis Farina, and sexy Kim Griest, as well as solid turns from every other supporting player (including, of all people, Chris Elliott during his dramatic ""acting"" period). I can think of few talents on par with director Mann (please IMDb him and you might be surprised at his output, and quirkiness). The same goes for the intensity of Petersen, and Brian Cox as Lecktor. If there is one, good thriller-horror movie you need to watch, this is it. It is the ORIGINAL, at least as far as the crop released during the modern, post 1970's era of flash AND substance is concerned. And it is so intense that during its showing at my local cinema, a half dozen people walked out following a particularly gruesome - graphic without being degrading - scene near the beginning. Now THAT is directing (Hitchcock would be proud).",Manhunter
174,DylansFearFiles,Superior to Silence of the Lambs,10,24 January 2009,"I am a large fan of Hannibal Lecter. Tonight I finally saw this film. The novels are great, that I have read so far. ""Red Dragon"" is the best I've read so far.I didn't expect much out of this. I love Anthony Hopkins's performance even though I DO like Brian Cox. He just isn't my favorite. I also didn't think this was gonna be that great because it strayed away from the novel but I was wrong.Will Graham (William Petersen) is an retired FBI profiler. He has the great forensic gift...or curse...to think as a psychopath. Graham retired after arresting and almost losing his life to the infamous cannibalistic mass-murderer and brilliant psychiatrist, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Brian Cox). Graham is put back on the case by Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina) to capture a serial killer known as the Tooth Fairy, who kills entire families, the killer's real identity is no secret, he is Francis Dolarhyde (Tom Noonan).Graham is scarred by the traumas he suffered in his career. He is putting himself and his family in danger. He calls on the incarcerated Hannibal Lecter for help. While Dolarhyde is falling in love with a blind co-worker named Reba McClane (Joan Allen) and searching for Will Graham, Will is also closing in on Dolarhyde. I honestly enjoyed this film more than ""Silence of the Lambs"", which is also a great movie. In this, they gave Hannibal Lecter an everywhere-and-nowhere prescense by only showing him a handful of times and referring to him frequently during the film. Brian Cox equaled up to Anthony Hopkins, whose performance is the one I prefer but I find Brian Cox's Lecter to be more realistic.The film is not a lot like the novel, as I mentioned before, but also does a great job at sticking to the main idea of Thomas Harris's masterpiece. I found the tortured Francis Dolarhyde as a more chilling character than the Jame Gumb/Buffalo Bill.The acting is great. The songs they used in the film were perfect (Strong As I Am, used in the ""betrayal"" scene). I did not care much for the movies score though, but it was tolerable.If you are a fan of the other Hannibal Lecter films, you'd better watch this. You will never regret it. I assure you that you will have a good time and will be surprised by this underrated classic.",Manhunter

176,john_oneill41,Good But Dated,6,13 February 2007,"First and foremost, this is movie that has dated very quickly (although not that quickly I suppose......it is 20 years old.) The synthesiser music, pastel walls and general Miami Vice/Magnum PI feel are by 2007 starting to look less dated and more period which is fine.William L Petersen gives a fine, understated performance as Will Graham, and Brian Cox is merely OK as Hannibal Lektor. I think the problem is he's just not scary enough. It's as if Cox is pretending to be a psychopath rather than acting one for a movie. In real life I'm sure serial killers behave the way he does in prison, i.e. mostly they appear to be normal ordinary people. However, a movie is meant to entertain and sometimes caricatures are necessary, which is why Anthony Hopkins is so effective is Silence of the Lambs. The upshot of this is that when Will Graham runs from the facility after speaking to Lektor, the audience can't really appreciate why, especially since Lektor is locked up very securely.Tom Noonan is extremely effective as the Tooth Fairy, producing just the right level of menace, looking suitably weird.One particularly striking part of the movie for me was when Graham is on the plane and falls asleep and the photos of the murder scenes spill. A little girl sees them and is frightened half to death.Soemething similar happened to me when I was young, looking through a book on murders that I wasn't old enough to be looking through.This is a good film which you should watch if you get the chance.",Manhunter
177,rsj624,A Decent Red Dragon Adaptation,7,2 September 2014,"--WARNING: There may be some spoilers ahead for those who haven't seen the film, so just a heads up. In order to accurately review this film, it may be necessary to talk about some key moments.--This is a film I watched based upon reading a lot of excerpts and snip- its stating that it was one of the finer accomplishments of the 80s in terms of style and substance; not really very appreciated at it's time but much more understood and respected throughout the years. It's not hard for an average movie goer to spot exactly why it was so initially rejected by both viewers and critics alike. It's influences of the time were immediately noticeable and mostly considered uninspired along with it's pacing and atmosphere, which weren't exactly the norm during the blockbuster boom of the 80s cinema landscape.However, from the acting to the specifics and details regarding the hunt for a killer, as interesting and well thought out as everything was during this movie, it still feels like it's been 1up'd by many more films that have come after. I felt constantly pulled in and pulled out of this film by no one thing in particular. It was just hard to go from segment to segment and feel any sort of consistency in interest. The style and the pacing as slow as it was, both were hardly ever the problem; more the fact that much of what the film focused on just wasn't genuinely that interesting. It seemed like it wanted to be much more than it was.Brian Cox playing Hannibal was one of the high points in the film, and from what I've gathered this was intentionally done, but I find it a critical mistake to make your most interesting segments regarding a character that doesn't even take a front seat in the book series till ""Silence of the Lambs"" and then is left largely behind by the en, more or less forgotten. Manhunter is not a bad film, but it isn't very hard to see why it didn't catch on at it's time. Not an easy recommendation unless you feel the need to see every movie adaptation involving the Hannibal mythos.",Manhunter
178,mazec666,"It's just you and me now, sport...",10,7 October 2012,"Fresh off his successful television series ""Miami Vice,"" Michael Mann returns to the big screen with a landmark psychological thriller. Based on Thomas Harris' second novel ""Red Dragon,"" this film is the first in the Hannibal Lecter series and possibly the best by far.Former ""CSI"" lead William Petersen excels radiantly as emotionally scarred FBI Agent Will Graham who is about receive a last-chance opportunity from his boss Jack Crawford (played by the always admirable Dennis Farina). An opportunity to catch an enigmatic serial killer called ""The Tooth Fairy"" with a metaphysical quest to shadow the 'Red Dragon' based on William Blake's painting of the same name. In order to enter the killer's theoretical mind, Graham must confront the man that severely damaged his reputationHannibal the Cannibal.As masterfully played by then-unknown Brian Cox, the enquiringly misspelled Dr. 'Lecktor' is presented here as a contrast to Anthony Hopkins' portrayal. Instead of the eccentric and socially refined Hannibal, Cox gives the viewer a restrained and intangible depiction in the form of a normal-looking prisoner. From a film-goer's perspective, this is the most ingenuous version of the title character that the I've ever seen. Now, don't get me wrong Hopkins certainly deserved his Oscar and the acclaim, but Cox has accomplished more in 10 minutes of screen time than Sir Tony's monopolizing scenery-chewing in ""Red Dragon"". The next paragraph brings me to the ""Tooth Fairy"" himself, Francis Dollarhyde.The tremendously talented and always under-appreciated Tom Noonan has been type-cast throughout his whole career as the baddie. Noonan's riveting performance successfully brought out his undiscovered talents to the forefront. Just watch the scene in which he grants a slide show of the victims' families to sleazy tabloid journalist Freddie Lounds (Stephen Lang) for evidence. In the book, Dollarhyde was given a detailed past of his abusive childhood and personal motivations. However, none of this is revealed in ""Manhunter"" because we are more concerned with Graham's investigation rather than how Dollarhyde came to be. And I'm so glad that the Dragon tattoo was never in the final version otherwise, this film would have never been taken seriously.The one scene that really stood out was the grand finale between Graham and Dollarhyde. Set to Iron Butterfly's psychedelic opus ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,"" this confrontation was choreographed perfectly, edited flawlessly and photographed impeccably by Dante Spinotti. From watching that sequence alone, that could have been a movie of its own for that matter.The one question that comes to the mind: Can Graham ever come out of Dollarhyde's darkness? Find out for yourself!",Manhunter

What I saw was a super-stylish, smart thriller with just about perfect casting. Mann's setups are all beautifully balanced, his music cues are flawless, and the editing superb. A much-younger-than-most-of-you-remember-him William Petersen plays the protagonist with a nice balance of haunted fatalism and odd intensity. He just can't really help himself - he HAS to solve crimes, no matter what the personal cost (and it is high). Tom Noonan is pitch-perfect as Francis Dolarhyde. Yes, he's loathsome, but it is truly pathetic how close he comes to saving himself. Noonan understands that no believable baddie can be without some pathos. But then there's Brian Cox as Lecktor. No pathos as all, but extremely good. He's more like the Lecktor of the books - smooth, sleek...like an otter, I think he's described. Not the virtuoso scenery-chewing of Hopkins, as everyone points out, but I really liked this performance. Do yourself a favor and check out this movie.",Manhunter

181,NEFARlOUS,*MUCH* better than SOTL (Aka Hollywood Psycho),10,2 February 2001,"I saw Manhunter about eight years ago and was very impressed. I saw SOTL five years ago and was unintentionally amused.Manhunter has a far more believable Lector, intelligent, insightful, charming and lethal. Someone who embodies all that I've seen in interviews with the more cerebral of real-life serial killers. This is someone who quite patently could pass for normal in society and who in all probability got caught either completely by chance (as in this case) or because of a subconcious desire to do so.SOTL has a 160lb ham with cartoon-style wide eyes, horrific overacting, incredibly pretentious complete with a dungeon-style setting in a badly lighted cell just in case the audience forgets how nasty he is. They even put a hockey mask on him and strap him to a stretcher - Friday the 13th anyone?In Manhunter we learn something about Dolarhyde, his outlook, his fears, his mannerisms and even the things he sees that never happen.In SOTL we get to see someone who would be completely at home on an episode of Jerry Springer.In Manhunter we meet Peterson, driven and haunted. In SOTL we meet Starling who seems lost and unbalanced.Now let's move on to some of the criticisms about the departures of Manhunter from Red Dragon. Some I miss, but some I prefer, for example:1) Dolarhyde in the book was someone who was tortured by the voice of the Dragon in the William Blake painting. (although it's obviously himself) He tries to mend his ways and even breaks into the museum housing the original painting and EATS it in an attempt to stop the voices. I miss that in the film.2) Dolarhyde in the book is someone who was actually severely bullied at the orphanage where he was brought up because of the hairlip he  was born with, something that was to lead to him becoming psychotic. This is, at least covered a little in the film by the occasional reflex of covering his mouth and trying to hide the hairlip and his use of ""ummm-hmmmm"" instead of risking a mispronounciation of ""yes""3) Dolarhyde was forced by the Dragon to lift heavier and heavier weights with the result that he was immensely strong. In the film instead of limiting themselves to an actor with a pronounced  psysique they go for someone who is relatively very tall, almost  looming in presence. Tom does this well so I don't mind this.4) In the book, there is an ending involving a beach by daylight and a fishing rod.

As for the movie category, Michael Mann's ""Manhunter"", the adaptation of the novel, would quite possibly take the grand prize. Both the book and the movie are far superior to the overfamed ""Silence of the Lambs"". Mann, a long-time specialist in creating atmospheric pictures, managed to make a true classic, and his skill of using the right music to magnify the ambience shows best in this film.",Manhunter
183,Lunchbox-8,"Didn't do justice to ""The Silence of the Lambs.""",7,18 January 2001,"Being an obsessive person, I rented this film after I heard the release date for ""Hannibal"".  I actually read the book that this movie was based on but hadn't yet gotten around to seeing the movie.  ""The Red Dragon,"" the prequel to ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" was a good novel.  Despite it's length, which actually wasn't so long, it provided great suspense as well as a great plot.  I must admit that I am a Lecter-holic (Don't worry, I don't admire his killings or evil; I just think that he's a great character) and once I rented SOTL as a warm-up to seeing ""Hannibal,"" I had to see this movie.  I just had a taste for Hannibal (pun intended). 
  The problem with this film is that it hardly amounts to SOTL or the novel, ""The Red Dragon.""  It had too bright and happy of a setting: alot of the backgrounds were white or had sunshine, which is quite contrary to ""The Silence of the Lambs'"" darker and depressing, autumn settings.  Also, the film was poorly casted.  I thnk that this Brian Cox, the actor who played Hannibal Lecter a.k.a. Lektor (spelled differently for some reason in the film), was a bad person to play a criminal mastermind; he didn't have the right look (facially, he seemed to look like more of an average criminal and not a refined genius) or the right voice in that is was more hoarse and less, as I said, refined than Anthony Hopkins' voice.  He also had a strong UK accent, not a soft, suspicious voice.  And all the scenes with this dark character were filmed in a bare walled, completely white prison cell, which didn't showcase Hannibals intelligence and taste.    My final beef with ""Manhunter"" is that the movie had substantial differences between the book, as in most book-movies.  The most noticeable is the ending which was not a good one.  In the book, the ending was complicated and surprising, but in the film it was short and just average action.    But beyond my petty criticisms, the movie was pretty good.  I only say this because I like the plot so much.  If you want a quick warm-up to seeing ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and/or ""Hannibal,"" you can watch this movie just to get situated with the whole detective/serial killer point of view.  But if you want a real good way to experience the first chapter about Hannibal Lecter and the F.B.I., then read the novel, ""The Red Dragon.""  You'll like this almost as much as ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" (movie or book) because both, that film, in my opinion, truly is a work of art.                       Rating: 7/10, low seven",Manhunter

I also have exquisite taste, which is why I get so exercised when I see inane reviews of great movies by people obviously ill equipped to review them: Movies are not books, and books are not movies.  They are two separate art forms.  Got that, readers of Red Dragon?So the 1960s film of ""Tom Jones"" starring Albert Finney is not a completely faithful depiction of Thomas Hardy's wonderful novel, which I have read twice.  So what?  They are both wonderful in their own way.  Anyone who denigrates ""Manhunter"" because they think the book was just SO much greater shouldn't go to movies, because they don't get any better than ""Manhunter,"" regardless of the source material.  And anyone who would argue that ""Silence of the Lambs"" is a better movie than ""Manhunter"" is a moron.  A moron with bad taste.""Manhunter"" is so gripping, so utterly chilling, so absolutely scary it practically gives me chills to type this.  In fact, I do get chills whenever I think about it.  (A friend of mine who lives in the country in Missouri called me to berate me after I sent her a copy and has steadfastly refused to watch the entire film.)Manhunter's meticulous, cold-blooded, and unrelenting depiction of the mad-but-brilliant methodology of some psychotic killers is unequaled in my experience, and I've see 'em all.  This is nothing short of a masterpiece. A flippin' miracle of a movie.  It at least deserved an Oscar and a much wider audience.  You will never leave a door unlocked or a window uncovered after seeing this movie.  I know I haven't.(As a sidebar, John Hinckley, another mad (would-be) killer, corresponded with one of his idols, the late Ted Bundy, while locked up in a mental institution for shooting President Reagan.

Red dragon, while roughly 20 years younger, runs circles around this movie. This movie isn't bad but if you watched red dragon and the Hannibal series multiple times like I have, this movie is a ""made for tv "" version by comparison.It's not bad, it's not good, it's just ""meh"".

188,Fenris Fil,"Good effort, poor results.",4,22 September 2002,"Based on Thomas Harris' ""Red Dragon"" novel this film had a lot of potential. Sadly if failed badly to achieve this. Several liberties were taken with the plot and the characters background. Most notably Hannibal Lecter is made out to be a paedophile as they combined the story of Lecters capture with the story of the incident that made Will Graham first quit his work for the FBI. Presumably they did this to save time explaining the two separate incidents but it worked to reduce Lecters impact significantly even despite the impressive performance from Brian Cox.The worst problem however is the end of this film. The story is cut off suddenly a long way from its finishing point in the novel. By finishing it early the various elements of the story never really come together and you can't help but feel disappointed. It seems there were serious budget problems, which possibly led to them having to conclude filming earlier then intended and it is very obvious in the last few scenes of the film as they keep re-showing the same footage of someone being shot multiple times presumably to save their special effects budget.Despite all this however the film is worth a look, because the strength of the story that Harris wrote still manages to shine through. The Novel ""Red Dragon"" is without doubt the best work Harris has done to date, even better then ""Silence of the Lambs"" and it's weaker sequel ""Hannibal"". Sadly though this film doesn't live up to the standard of the book. It remains to be seen whether the new ""Red Dragon"" film will do any better, as it seems production on that may have been rushed also. However if they stick to the story and don't change too much they can't really go far wrong. That may leave this film seeming redundant, however it is still worthy of note due to it being the earliest film to be based on one of Harris' Hannibal Lecter books.It is also worth noting that one of the reasons this film was virtually unknown when Lambs came out was because of incredibly poor distribution. It seemed whatever the intentions of the director and producer there were so many obstacles in the way of this film it was doomed to failure from day one.",Manhunter
189,glennwalsh44,More believable ending.,10,25 September 2002,"I will go to see 'Red Dragon' when it comes out to see how it compares to 'Manhunter,' although it will need to go some to better Michael Mann's 80s classic.  My only comments are about the ending.  I had seen 'Manhunter' several times before reading 'Red Dragon' (and 'Silence Of The Lambs' in one weekend) and really didn't like the ending in the book at all.  It was far too contrived and unbelievable to hold up well on screen and it reminded me of Lecter's escape in 'Silence,' which required a total suspension of disbelief from me to accept.  I prefer the ending in 'Manhunter' because it is believable, but still very tense and the use of Iron Butterfly's 'In A Gadda Da Vida' was inspired.  PS I also love that bit of music where Dolarhyde is ripping up the dash in his van and finally got it a few months back.",Manhunter
190,grahamcarter-1,In The Garden Of Evil,9,14 May 2017,"The novel 'Red Dragon' (1981) refers to 'The Great Red Dragon' paintings by William Blake, which depict scenes from the Book of Revelation. These allegorically describe an ongoing struggle between good and evil. The novel spawned the Michael Mann film 'Manhunter' (1986).Simpson in his book 'Psycho Paths: Tracking the Serial Killer through Contemporary American Film,' refers to 'Manhunter' as a 'profoundly ambiguous and destabilizing film' with 'uncomfortable affinities between protagonist and antagonist.' Conard in 'The Philosophy of Film Noir' is more to the point; ""what it takes to catch a serial killer is tantamount to being one.""Mann and cinematographer Dante Spinotti (who funnily enough also shot the 2002 remake 'Red Dragon'), make strong use of colour tints using cool blues in the scenes featuring Will Graham and his wife Molly, green for searching and discovery, and purple or magenta in the unsettling scenes involving Dollarhyde (the 'Tooth Fairy') and Doctor Hannibal Lecter. The foregrounding of glass, steel and concrete walls illustrates Mann's concern with estrangement and 'mirror images.' Graham is capable of apprehending Dollarhyde because he can get into his mindset and share similar psychological instincts, resulting in him struggling to regain his values. Dr Lector whom Graham visits in prison in order to gather a profile of Dollarhyde, recognises this.Both visually, and in regards to the feeling of alienation Mann is reminiscent of Michelangelo Antonioni. Mann borrows from Antonioni the concern for capturing the space that people inhabit. An early perfectly composed symmetrical shot illustrates the relationship between Graham and Agent Crawford, with the clear positioning of the characters on opposite ends of the frame as Crawford attempts to coerce Graham back to the FBI. The final shot of this sequence is of Crawford and Molly, and the physical distance between them is far greater than in the shot that opens the sequence.Towards the end of the chase, Graham (talking about Dollarhyde) could be discussing the key themes of Dario Argento's work, a director also influenced by Antonioni's visual asthetic "" because everything with you is seeing isn't it. Your primary sensory intake, the thing that makes your dream live is seeing. Reflections. Mirrors. Images""The song by Iron Butterfly 'In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida' (a mondegreen for 'In The Garden Of Evil'), is memorably used in the climax, and reminds one of the thumping 'Goblin' scores employed by Argento, particularly in 'Deep Red' and 'Tenebre'.Argento has said he didn't like the film, disliking how the novel's ending was changed for the film. Argento's 'Opera' would incorporate the end of the novel 'Red Dragon.'",Manhunter
191,jasonpauljones-64690,A lot of thought went into this,6,1 June 2021,"I realise this film is based on the literature of Thomas Harris and therefore not exactly original, but I felt the makers of this film put a lot of time and effort into bringing the viewers a very decent flick. The lead investigator played by William Peterson is engaging, the killer is ok but not as good as Hopkins work in Red Dragon. Attention to detail is evident and its all very slick and moves along at a good pace for a 2-hour fare. The only criticism I have is that there is not a lot of kills by the killer (just references to ones that already happened), so maybe Im a sicko too! The later 'Silence', Hannibal and Red Dragon all have a lot more horror which I enjoyed but even so, Manhunter is worth your time.",Manhunter
192,thirdi,"Excellent, A First Rate Thriller",10,10 June 2002,"This movie seems to generate mixed reviews but I thought it was outstanding. William Peterson gives a great performance as an FBI agent lured out of retirement to help the cops find a truly creepy serial killer.  Peterson just has that ""All American Hero"" mug, this is the classic 80's ""slightly disturbed but intelligent good guy"" role.The acting throughout is solid while the tension and suspense build. Director Michael Mann (""Heat"", ""The Insider"", ""Last of The Mohicans"") rarely misses the mark in my opinion, and this film is no exception.  Watching the extras on the DVD, you really get a sense of how it was such a labor of love for the director, cast and crew.I think knowing very little about this movie going into it (like the fact that it was based on Thomas Harris' book and had the original characters that would make up the monster hit ""Silence of The Lambs"") made me enjoy it even more.  For future generations this will be a challenge since they are remaking it.  For the life of me I can't figure out why they are doing it, but even if the remake falls short of expectations (as ""Hannibal"" did) it will no doubt be the first ""Manhunter"" that many see, and when they go back to view this little gem, it might lose its power.Either way, ""Manhunter"" has found enough of an audience over the years to keep it out there, almost in a cult-like status.  Many that I know still say its better than ""Silence..."" although I stop short of that.  The truth is, its hard to compare the two, they are both riveting in their own ways.Don't cheat yourself out of a fine film, be sure and check this one out if you haven't.",Manhunter

Anyone who knows Mann's style could notice the slickness of Miami Vice, yet few noticed how well style and image was married to a thoroughly engrossing plot to create one of the best detective thrillers of all time.As one of my colleagues have commented, Manhunter does contain career best performances of Tom Noonan and William Petersen.  Manhunter was truly one of the first films I've seen to depict a serial killer as childlike and certainly pathetic.  Conversely the protagonist, Special Agent Will Graham, is not overflowing with machismo, but rather sensitive, driven, and tortured.  Well supported by Dennis Farina, Brian Cox, Dan Butler, Stephen Lang, Joan Allen, and even Chris Elliot, the film far outstrips her sequel, Silence of the Lambs.Intelligent, thought-provoking, and taut, Manhunter is not to be missed.",Manhunter

Michael Mann's sole ambition -and critical miscalculation- was to create primarily a piece of eerie atmosphere and morbid mood, something which the movie succeeds in transmitting and which is justifiable by the gritty narrative. But it would be fair to say that Thomas Harris's literary material called for a conventional crime thriller equipped with all the trademark eccentricities, and what we get here is an abstractive study of evil envisaged by an auteur who doesn't always make sense.

198,chets808,Silence of the Miami Heat,6,6 February 2001,"Looking back now at this 1986 release, it breaks down like a cocktail. one part Miami Vice (bad 80s hairstyles, lots of hot pink and cool blues), one part Silence of the Lambs (there are elements that carry over in Harris' sequel, most notably, the FBI investigator employing the help of Hannibal Lecter to catch another seriel killer) and one part Heat (Michael Mann was obviously honing his masterful skill with this movie, but it does not come to fruition until 1995's magnificent Heat; the helicopter night shots, a frozen cold house on the beach, etc.)
Maybe its just me but I felt the lead character, FBI dude, was weak. He just didnt get my attention, seemed kind of out of sorts in certain shots, I cant put my finger on it but overall the acting and writing seemed weak. Taken in its context it was probably a much more satisfying movie for 1986, I can't think of another movie like it that came before. But it's been done a few times since, and much better.

200,dung_rat,"Great, but flawed adaptation-wise",8,18 December 2002,"While it's true that this adaptation of Thomas Harris' novel isn't overly authentic, Michael Mann has succeeded in creating a genuinely decent and convincing thriller.Now facing competition and the obligatory comparisons from its updated incarnation, Red Dragon; more viewers are now aware that this legacy actually began in the 1980s.Overall Manhunter, in my view, is a very chilling and suspenseful thriller  the first 40 minutes bare great testimony to this. There is a sense of something ominous, broodingemphatically sinister and macabre. The film isn't particularly violent, certainly not in comparison to Red Dragon (which I personally thought was a little too violent, for my liking) but the notions of fear and anxiety help to conjure a sense of horror which is rich and almost unsurpassed. Horror that doesn't have to rely heavily upon depictions of graphic violence is always an impressive thing.The inconsistencies with the plot in relation to Harris' Red Dragon is perhaps where the film fails somewhat. By replacing the original ending of the novel with a gun-toting finale just seems to defeat the entire `Manhunting' process. After laboriously trying to hunt the killer piece by piece only to have him gunned down seems to defeat the object. This lowers the expectations and makes for an abrupt ending; not good. On a minor and perhaps insignificant area, Mann should have included the body tattoo on Francis Dollarhyde  apparently he was against this as he thought it `trivialised' the character. These small aesthetic details can add a certain spice to a film, no matter how small or seemingly unimportant.Nonetheless, the acting is superb and helps to give a new slant to how the characters are portrayed both in the novel and Red Dragon. Brian Cox, for me, is a superior Lector than that (camp) Mr Hopkins. Even Tom Noonan's portrayal as the anti-hero Francis Dollarhyde (as it's spelt in this film) is practically flawlessperhaps more detail could have been spent on his background and psychosis, though.A great soundtrack and stylish direction makes this film trump Red Dragon. It just seems, though, that there is never going to be a totally authentic and `true' adaptation of such a great novel. For my money though, I'll stick by the original movie adaptation  Manhunter.",Manhunter
201,TexVanWinkle,Superior in almost every way,8,20 October 2002,"** Massive spoilers ahead **I had an itch to compare, so I rented Manhunter last night to compare to Red Dragon, which I watched yesterday afternoon. This after just finishing the book yesterday morning.Manhunter is superb. The most amazing thing about it is how perfectly it follows the book up until the very end, even in the smallest touches. I mean, they even use the same headlines in the Tattler that Harris uses in the book. It starts getting off-track when it first introduces Reba into Dolarhyde's life -- they compress and just change that storyline too much -- but the first three-quarters of the movie are lifted practically straight out of the book, dialogue and all. They kept a lot more of it and followed it precisely when they did. It makes a huge difference. The biggest change Mann made to the storyline is that he chose not to concentrate on Dolarhyde's evolution at all and simply show him as a serial killer. There's no facial scarring at all, so when they do happen to have Reba comment on his speech it makes no sense. It's frustrating because Mann could have dropped a couple of scenes he invented (but which didn't take away from the story at all) to make more time for the Dolarhyde/Reba development, and reimagined the scenes of theirs he already had, and done it just right. In a word, urg. Mann also chose just to change the ending completely, which is rather inexplicable considering his fanatical faithfulness to the rest of the book. He has Graham and Farina go after Dolarhyde in his house. No fire, no Dolarhyde going to Florida after Graham. It's weird.But his choice in actors was virtually flawless, in my opinion. With the notable exception that Fiennes makes a better Dolarhyde -- but that could merely be because Ratner followed the book more closely in that instance than Manhunter; Tom Noonan probably could have done a good enough job with Fiennes' material -- the actors in every case were better than in the other movies. And -- I know this is heresy -- I think that may even apply to Anthony Hopkins. After watching SOTL again, I think I might actually prefer Brian Cox's take on Lecter better than Hopkins'.It's a close call. Hopkins has the advantage of being able to portray Lecter in the outside world in the other films, and I think he does a better job of that than Cox would do, but taking strictly the Red Dragon storyline -- I think Cox does a better job. Well -- hm. I don't know. Cox's Hannibal seems more attached to reality, though. Ah, I know what it is: Hopkins is better at portraying Lecter's refined nature, but Cox doesn't overact like Hopkins does in all three of the later films. Hopkins is best in SOTL, but I wish to god he'd played Lecter down in all three of them. For me there would be no question of him as the better Lecter if he'd played Lecter with less glassy, wide eyes and more just as a pleasant, droll connoisseur who happens also to be insane. I'm thinking of his portrayals in Shadowlands or 84 Charing Cross Road, with the serial killer edge. That would have been brilliant. Ah well. I am intensely curious, though, now, to know how well Cox would have done with the SOTL material. I think he could have been damn good.As for all the other actors, though, no question for me: Manhunter's were better choices. Peterson loses it some when he has to rage a little, but overall he nails Graham. More brooding, more pensive, more defensive, less eager -- angrier -- he's just outstanding, MUCH better than Norton. Jason disagrees with me, but I think Dennis Farina does by far the best Crawford. He likes Scott Glenn in SOTL. Scott's take is fine, but I like Farina's better, though it might just be that he mixes with Peterson better as actors. Joan Allen is closer as Reba, stronger, more direct, even though she never gets the chance to live the character that Emily Cox does in Red Dragon, which is too bad because Joan Allen is a great actress. Stephen Lang is closer as Lounds, Kim Griest as Molly, and even the families chosen to portray the Leeds and Jacobis are better: They're less caricatured; their videos look more like real home videos.What it comes down to is if you were to take the first three quarters of Manhunter and the last quarter of Red Dragon -- basically use the Dolarhyde/Reba storyline from Red Dragon in Manhunter -- you'd have an outstanding film remarkably true to the book. First and foremost read the book, but after that, watch Manhunter and be amazed.",Manhunter
202,The_Hateful_Citizen,The first Hannibal Lecter's movie,6,28 June 2017,"The first film about the famous Hannibal Lecter dates from 1986 and this is the problem of this movie I think, it has aged badly. Besides this problem, it is still a Hannibal Lecter that is not played by Anthony Hopkins, certainly, but Brian Cox is not bad, as is William Peterson who is well present in his role as main actor. One complaint I could make at this movie is also that it is a bit too long. Otherwise, it is not bad and a 3/5 is therefore logical for the first Hannibal Lecter's movie.",Manhunter
203,rchalloner,An excellent film best watched on its own terms - but Cox is not Lecter.,8,13 September 2020,"This is indeed and excellent film and I think, best watched without reference to Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs or the books on which they are based. Michael Mann has clearly diverted from the book Red Dragon and brought his own inimitable style to the film, which is fine. The performances are all very good, with the exception in my opinion, of Brian Cox, who was adequate, but nothing more. I find it very hard to understand the praise heaped on him for his portrayal of Dr 'Lektor', which was as bland as his prison cell. I found nothing in the least chilling about his performance and if the people who laud him had bothered to read any of the books, he is nothing whatever like Thomas Harris's Dr Lecter. Dr Lecter is a sophisticated, cultured, many layered psychopath, whereas Brian Cox's Lektor came across as an uncouth slob with a very high opinion of himself, who was more sly than intelligent. Furthermore, Cox's accent changed starting as Anglo-Scottish and ending up American. There is really no point in comparing the performances of Anthony Hopkins and Brian Cox as they are essentially playing totally different characters. Anthony Hopkins was true to the Dr Lecter created by Thomas Harris, whereas Brian Cox's Lektor could be anyone. Anthony Hopkins is furthermore, in a different league from Mr Cox when it comes to acting. With regard to Francis Dollarhyde I think Tom Noonan's performance was extremely good but again, he is nothing like the Francis Dollarhyde in the book Red Dragon or for that matter the film, so again there is no point making a comparison with Ralph Fiennes. As it happens Ralph Fiennes Dollarhyde is much closer to the book, which was intentional, just as Michael Mann was intentionally bringing his own interpretation to the story. Personally I would have been very interested to see what Michael Mann would have done if he had decided to remain faithful to the book Red Dragon. I'm sure it would have been an excellent film and maybe then, Brian Cox could have been a bit more impressive. Just enjoy this as a stand alone movie and forget about the other films and the books.",Manhunter
204,tcdarkness,A far too literal book adaption at times.,4,7 June 2002,"Some spoilers. Often times, fans of a book-turned-movie complain of how the story vastly differs from the book on which it is based.  This can certainly ruin a film just as much as it can make a film, since certain plot lines in books are too long to fit in a movie or unfit to the rest of a screenplay.  Manhunter is the type of film that was just the opposite, an almost literal, verbatim copy of the book.  In this case, it was not as effective as changing some storylines/quotes to better fit a film. There are just small things--like Graham looking over the pictures of the dead families on an airplane and thinking of his wife carrying a six-pack of longneck Mexican beer aboard a boat--that are in the book and just did not need to be in the film.  There's a lot of small things that were directly taken from the book and could have been modified, lengthened or deleted entirely.  Also bad was how Graham would say lines in the movie that he THOUGHT in the book, making him seem like a loon (""You touched her with your bare hands, didn't ya?!""). The meeting with Hannibal Lector (while one of the highlights of the film) is one of those types of things that could have used some help.  Their conversations in the book and film are almost identical.  However, there just seems to be something missing in the film that is in the book: backstory.  Yes, we know the basics of what happens between Graham and Lector several years prior, but it needed more than just a brief summary.  A flashback or opening in that scene and then fast forwarding some 4 or 5 years would have done wonders to add some tension.  When Lector tells Graham to ""smell yourself"" and then Graham runs for about 15 seconds through the building, there is no apparent tension.  I certainly didn't feel any.  Graham  just does not seem to be haunted by his ability to think like the killer.  Some mental hauntings by the children he can picture being murdered in his head would have been much more dramatic. Overall, this is a very bad adaption for Mann.  The script is weak and the direction is mediocre.  I can only assume he was doing this while he was busy working on Miami Vice among other things as well and took some shortcuts.  With the book-titled remake of this film being penned by ""Silence of the Lambs"" scriptor Ted Tally, I think that it will be a superior film to this.  How--as the DVD case says--people consider Manhunter to be superior to Silence is beyond me.  4/10",Manhunter

The diversions don't have a music score suitable for a film, but rather hit music complete with lyrics. These songs even drown the dialogue in the movie - what were they thinking?",Manhunter
206,billking6666,Better than Red Dragon,8,13 March 2014,"Before Silence of the Lambs there was this. If you were lucky enough to catch this before SOTL showed up in the theaters (as I was) then it made the theater experience fantastic. Brian Cox was a better Lecter in physique, but Hopkins did a better job of portraying Lecter's cerebral side. The director on this does a spectacular job, giving the movie his signature ""Miami Vice"" look and feel. The most exciting part of the film is punctuated by the greatest drum solo ever heard by human ears, played by Iron butterfly. I had seen Manhunter on VHS and told a friend of mine about it one night, over a few beers and explained how he needed to rent it before going to see SOTL in the local theater. He took my advice and thanked me the next week. He said ""It was great, the wife and I had a serial killer weekend!""",Manhunter
207,Jynne,"A very good movie, but underrated",10,4 January 2000,"I would recommend this movie because even if you don't know (or care) who Thomas Harris is, or if you haven't seen ""Silence of the Lambs,"" it doesn't matter--this movie can stand on its own.  Unfortunately, because it didn't have a ""big name"" in the lead role and because it has some of Michael Mann's trademarks in it (as good as they are), it isn't as well-known as it should be.  Don't be distracted by the somewhat dated music and ""Miami Vice"" photography--the characters, dialogue, and cast are GREAT! (look for early appearances by Dan Butler of ""Frasier"" and Joan Allen of ""Pleasantville"")",Manhunter
208,Member,Not really terrible or terribly innovative...,1,20 December 1999,"As much acclaim that have been given to Manhunter and SOTL I find that the films just owe too much to a genre filled with mediocrities. Although both the films are very interesting when looking at the process of bringing a novel on the screen the main interest in my opinion lies with the novels. As the Red Dragon was interesting as an introduction into the world of Lektor/Lecter, SOTL started to repeat the form, making the book and the film both predictable and not so much new and innovative. Manhunter may look a bit cheap in comparison with SOTL that was made in the 90's with a large budget as it was intended as a mainstream film. But my criticism of the Manhunter does not lie in the lack of a grand budget but rather in the handling of the story. As Mann follows the novel fairly extensively, the film could still use more material from the book. The look of the film might also be better, with the Miami Vice images just making me head for the exit or for another channel. The story could elaborate more about the character of Dolarhyde but even the novel doesn't really go that far in the philosophical dimensions that are there in my opinion. In my mind the book builds on crime fiction tradition very much like the film does and even if that isn't necessarily bad they both still fall short of a place as any kinds of classics. Still occasionally effective Manhunter stands as an evidence to the fact that even Michael Mann can do something worthwhile when he stays away from TV-series and epics.",Manhunter
209,thepearlpoint,Don't judge a book by its cover,9,12 December 2020,"All the reviews are about how it isn't faithful to the book but what movie is actually 100% faithful to the book(s)? Not many, that's for sure. Manhunter is a charming first entry to the Hannibal franchise. Brian Cox obviously does not beat Anthony Hopkins but he does give Hannibal a nice creepy feel.My only complaint would be that they really don't refine the characters, the chemistry is left in the dust to make way for the action and mystery. But other than that it's a wonderful movie.",Manhunter
210,mmintz,Michael Mann pulls out all the stops on this one!,7,13 September 2001,"MILD SPOILERS! I really like this movie!  I'm proud to own it (as well as ""Silence of the Lambs"") and find in it much to enjoy.  That having been clarified, I'll say this:  I definitely think it needs to be redone.  I'm really looking forward to a new treatment.  There is so much that was left out of the novel that another version (more true to the feel of the other two) could be terribly interesting.  I want to see more about Dollarhyde's past.  I want to see more about his evolution into the ""Red Dragon"".  And I really want to see the scene where he goes to New York and eats the classic Blake painting! ""Manhunter"" (as its name surreptitiously implies) is so ""Michael Mann""-ed out that the same movie by another director would be radically different. Furthermore, while I actually like it better than I like ""Silence of the Lambs"", I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's far superior (as some declare).  In some ways it is and it's always fun to root for the underdog but, as a whole, Demme's ""Silence of the Lambs"" is probably a better work.Unlike Mann's ""Last of the Mohicans"", ""Manhunter"" is pure Michael Mann.  In ""Mohicans"", Mann deliberately strips himself of ALL that makes him the distinctive director that he is and shows us that, even without his usual bag of tricks, he's still pretty good.  In sharp contrast, however, he pulls out all the stops in ""Manhunter"" and I love him for it!Somehow he uses a story that would've naturally looked like the other two Lector movies and takes it in a radically different direction and...it works!  ""Silence"" and ""Hannibal"" have cops in them but they are horror/psycho killer movies.  ""Manhunter"", on the other hand, has psychotic murderers, but is definitely a cop movie.  Consequently, it is tied to the other two about as much as Leo and Claire's ""R+J"" is tied to the usual Shakespearean treatments.  It has everything that Mann used to make ""Miami Vice"" such a work of brilliance.  It's got quirky, driving 80's rock combined with a moody, ambient score.  It's got a quirky, moody ""cop on the edge"" (complete with five o'clock shadow).  It's even got a cameo by MV's Michael Talbot (Agent Switek) and Dennis Farina (who made an appearance in a few MV episodes).  As in ""Miami Vice"", we see the shaky juxtaposition of domestic life and the cop world and the nearly impossible struggle to hold onto both.  Moments of domestic bliss (bathed in unrealistic but beautifully blue moonlight) are contrasted with wonderfully mundane scenes. One of these that really works well is when Agent Graham and his step-son shop for groceries and discuss his first encounter with Lector.  And, of course, the whole movie is full of Mann's shockingly beautiful colours:  deep greens, reds, pinks, blues, and whites). Hell, just for good measure, Mann even throws in some ""white sand and green turtles"" beach scenes for those of us whose lives still bear that ""Miami Vice"" shaped vacuum.    
I also like Mann's treatment of Lector.  He has chosen to give him an important but far-from-central role in the film.  The choice to veer from this is what kills ""Hannibal"".  Personally I like Brian Cox's (Rob Roy) leering, creepy Lector.  No arguing that Hopkin's is excellent but everything that was wrong with ""Hannibal"" was right with ""Manhunter"".  In it, Lector may be remarkably perceptive and resourceful but he's still a disgusting, slimy, depraved old man.  He may be intriguing to us but he's clearly not worthy of adulation.  Cox's Lector is, in this respect, radically more believable than the cultured, enlightened creation of Anthony Hopkins.Tom Noonan, as Francis ""Toothfairy"" Dollarhyde, is pretty good too.  I definitely like him more than the antagonist, Jame ""Buffalo Bill"" Gumb, of ""Silence"".  In his own eerie, pitiable way he was able to provide the adequate amount of antagonistic focus that Gumb could not.  Gumb is good for gross-outs and over-all creepiness but he is never quite scary.  I think Dollarhyde is.  He may not be as formidable a foe as Lector but he still presents a clear antagonist.  (Be sure to note the ""wings"" of blood under his arms after he has been shot and killed.  This is, apparently, as close as he will get to becoming the ""Red Dragon"" he believed he was metamorphasizing into.)       Sure, ""Manhunter"" has weaknesses.  Graham's acting is sporadic.  The scenes where he is getting riled up at the as-yet-unknown killer are a bit weak. (""You son of a b****!  You wanted them to watch, didn't you?"")  Also, as much as I enjoy Mann, it's probably too stylized for its own good.  It will not be as timeless as ""Silence"". The year it was made (1986) is just as much a part of its identity as the original work by Harris was.  But for those of us who really liked 1986, I guess ""Manhunter"" will always be a favorite.",Manhunter
211,KrowbOy,One of my top 5 best movies,8,7 February 2001,"Michael Mann's 1986 adaption of the Thomas Harris novel Red Dragon now titled Manhunter is without a doubt one of the best thrillers (or can I say horror movies) ever made (I say horror because what else do you call movies about serial killers).  Manhunter is a winner on every level, from directing (but what did you expect from Michael Mann), acting, and all the other major technical jobs.  I actually think it's better than Silence of the Lambs because it involves you more with the characters and what goes into catching a killer thus making it that much more intense.  Now don't get me wrong Silence of the Lambs is really good and Jonathan Demme did a great job but the only reason some think it is the superior Lecter movie is because it is the mainstream Lecter movie, but for that I applaud it (how many other movies has been loved by the public and won oscars yet has a guy sling jizz in a woman's face).  Manhunter is, like all of Mann's movies, kinda artsy but thats also one of the things about his movies that make them so good. And no other directer except maybe Oliver Stone or David Lynch knows how to use music to set the mood better than Michael Mann, be it the score or songs in general.  The performances in Manhunter are all good except William Petersen's and Tom Noonan's which were GREAT!!!  William Petersen does a great job at showing the emotional toll the search for the killer has on him mentally, and I love the fact that he's a good guy with a kind of dark side in him.  There is something in Petersen's face that to me really shows his determination in catching the ""tooth fairy"" and he really is an underrated actor who should have bigger roles than he does.  Tom Noonan has made a career out of playing villians (at least until lately), the only ones that kinda stick out are The Ripper from Last Action Hero and Cain in Robocop 2. But those were typical bad guys and his performance as Francis Dollarhyde in Manhunter is hands down the best depiction of a serial killer ever.  Now I say that without knowing anything about serial killers other than whats on the news and in books but I'm sure they have some feelings (nobody's totally evil) and Tom Noonan shows this in his performance.  The killer is a cold blooded killer but has a human side that is shown once he meets Joan Allen's character.  There were scenes between them that really showed (through Noonan's performance) how messed up Dollarhyde is, like when she is kissing him and they have sex there is this look of unease and being totally uncomfortable on his face that really help flesh out the character.  Brian Cox, who played Lecter or actually Lecktor, does great with his performance also but this movie isn't about Lecter so he's only in it for 10 minutes at the most but does great with that time, his Lecter doesn't come off as being the embodiment of evil like the Hopkins performance but his Lecter is more of a sly, manipulitive character.  Not that I'm saying he's better than Anthony Hopkins because Mr. Hopkins deserved everything he got because of his performance but different movies have different interpretations.  The movie does leave out some things about Dollarhyde's past but I think they were not needed because Tom Noonan did enough on his part, but the ending does change a lot but then again after creating such a compelling character as Will Graham (one of my fave characters ever...right up there with William Sommerset from Se7en) I didn't want him to get mutilated and almost killed like in the books ending.  Plus if you think the killer is dead yet there is some hesitation in that AND the killer knows where you live I don't think you would go back to that house with your wife and child like in the book....oh and the kid's name is changed from Willy to Kevin but Willy would sound so corny, can u imagine the scene where Kim Griest says ""stay here with me...me and Kevin"" being ""stay here with me...me and Willy"" you wouldn't be thinking of the scene itself u would be thinking ""who the hell would name there child Willy"".  And the director's cut does add some more depth to the characters and the new scene at the end where Graham visits the family that was to be Dollarhyde's next victim's is really good, it's not all dialogue like ""you saved our lives"" and all that s**t, it's played in the character's face....there needed to be no dialogue for it.  Manhunter is one of the best movies ever in my opinion and will ALWAYS be one of the best of it's sub-genre.  Hat's off to Michael Mann and Anchor Bay for releasing that limited edition DVD.  One more thing this movie has my fave line of dialogue from Lecter, the whole ""have you ever seen blood in the moonlight"" scene was cool.",Manhunter
212,Seamus-25,A brave attempt hampered by a terrible soundtrack,6,18 April 2000,"This is the film of the excellent book ""Red Dragon"" by Thomas Harris. It is by no means a bad film but not as brilliant as ""Silence of the Lambs"". The film although exciting in many parts is let down by long periods of inactivity and a truly awful soundtrack. The acting is reasonably good especially by Tom Noonan who plays Francis Dolarhyde, his character was very similar to how I had imagined him in the book. The emotional torment of Will Graham does not make for exciting viewing and perhaps more time could have been spent examining the life of the Killer.",Manhunter
213,fs3,A classic thriller that more than equals its famous counterpart,9,1 December 2000,"When this gem came out in the summer of '86, it was gone and forgotten in the time it took to clean the neighboring theatres still showing Top Gun...too bad, because then and now, it stood high above the competition as one of the best crime thrillers in years.William Petersen had just distinguished himself less than a year before with his starring debut in To Live and Die in L.A. playing another lawman with different shadings.  His work here is notably intense without the hand-wringing histrionics that might have appealed to some of this great movie's detractors.Speaking of this great movie's detractors: some of the previous comments have complained about the nerve that it took to change Thomas Harris' ""great"" novel ending.  Long before this movie was ever thought of, I read and enjoyed Harris' work, but the ending of the book kind of struck me as a cheap horror movie ending.  And after that, with the onslaught of slasher pics that had been on the screens for nearly a decade, perhaps Mann and company realized that on film, that ending would even look MORE like a cheap horror movie than it read years before.  Whatever the reason, the ending of the film is well-shot and satisfying in the terms of a crime thriller (which after all is what this movie is...); better a typical crime movie ending than a typical Friday the 13th ending.The atmosphere and production values are all top-grade, despite the predictable beefs that plague movies on here of every decade except NOW: the usual comments, stuck in present day, that complain: it's ""too 80's"", ""looks too 80's"", ""terrible soundtrack..sounds too 80's.""  Guess what, folks, IT WAS MADE IN THE 80's!  There is always backlash over what went before; maybe great numbers of people are embarrassed over what they were dressing in, listening to, watching, etc. ten or twenty years ago.  But movies naturally exist, bad ones and good ones, as indicators of their era.I'm not defending the experience of that era, truth is, most of the movies released in the '80s were not great, but then, most movies released in any given year see the mediocre to bad far outweigh the good and definitely overshadow the great.  The point is, if you're happier being spoonfed the latest new releases, just because they carry a year-old or less release date, don't even venture back to the masterworks of yesteryear.  Might be some fashions or electronic music that frighten you more than the killer!Not every great movie from the past is going to be remade to capture the look and style of current day.  Good thing, too, because they'd probably blow it.  And even so, if this movie were remade with the equal brilliance and look of The Matrix, American Beauty, Fight Club (not a knock; I love them all) and other internet faves, chances are that in ten years, the same people would sit and write ""it had a decent plot, but looked and sounded so lame and cheesy...SO 90'S.""Manhunter still stands today as a great film, not eclipsed at all by its famous followup The Silence of the Lambs, which was a huge success financially and critically.  It's wonderful to remember that such a dark and un-Gandhi/Last Emperor/Driving Miss Daisy film won the Best Picture Oscar. And it was a fine  film, though not without just a few faults. (Jodie Foster's wardrobe was so '91......just kidding).  The obvious difference was the style in which Lecter was presented and played, but Brian Cox' work here is an admirable portrayal of Lecter at a different point, and it's actually a little more chilling to imagine his depraved crimes as he does not tip his hand at all with any frightening design to his work.  [No slight to Hopkins' fantastic work; his more overtly frightening mannerisms depict Lecter in a different set of circumstances.]The rest of the cast performs very well, with Noonan a frightening and enigmatic killer, Farina a dependable and sardonic Jack Crawford and Joan Allen in one of her earliest roles.  Only Kim Griest's role seems undernourished, but not much time is spent on the Graham's domestic life. (Further down in the cast, it's quite interesting to see funnyman Chris Elliott in a straight role behind a law enforcement desk.)The production design is a nice mix of dark foreboding and crisp brightness. Michael Mann did create Miami Vice (another thing everyone has to say was ""cheesy"" to be properly entrenched in modern thinking) and this film did come out right in the middle of its successful run.  Do they share some common design appearances?  Yes, and the movie's look is all the better for it, just as the show was changing the look of TV crime thrillers from Cannon and Barnaby Jones to something a little more striking.  With Thief, Manhunter and Heat, Michael Mann created three of the very best crime dramas of the last quarter century.  As decent and noble as The Insider was (and Ali will probably be), his fans would certainly agree that it's time for him to take another walk down the dark criminal alley again.",Manhunter
214,Chromium_five,"Gorgeous, thoughtful, and still underrated",9,20 November 2007,"It is baffling that some consider this film to be inferior to the over-the-top theatrics of ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Red Dragon."" It's at least the equal of ""Silence"" (Michael Mann's flashy style is restrained by comparison), and the fact that ""Red Dragon"" borrowed or outright copied large portions of this movie should be proof enough that Mann hit all the right notes the first time. I prefer Cox's Hannibal. Hopkins's larger-than-life portrayal was one of a kind, but he was not ""real."" He could do anything: driving people to suicide by whispering to them or staging the world's most elaborate prison break on a whim. He was a perfect being; Cox is not. Cox plays the insane man as insane. While Hopkins's stare was cold and calculating, Cox's stare is unfocused, like his mind is not all there. He also has a sort of immature cheekiness. He portrays intelligence and cunning while seeming mentally unstable and therefore unpredictable, which makes him more chilling, in my view.Tom Noonan is a memorable villain just due to his appearance. Ralph Fiennes was too muscular and good-looking to be a self-loathing wreck: Noonan's extremely tall build and awkward movements increase the creepiness of his character by a factor of 10, and his facial expressions convey crippling anxiety more than any dialogue could. It takes real acting talent to make a villain both sympathetic and revolting. Mann's direction is full of so many cool visual touches, it's impossible to list them all here. I'll limit it to saying the blue lighting when Graham is with his wife is beautiful, and there is great interest in trying to figure out just what it is about the background details (many of them imperceptibly ""off"") that make the film's mood so constantly unnerving (the cereal aisle in the grocery store, for instance, providing an extreme contrast between Graham's nightmarish inner world and the mundane outer one). Again, I like the other treatments of the Lecter novels, but because of the realistic depth that goes into the characters and the beautiful photography, this one is for me the most affecting.",Manhunter
215,2001mmFilm,Manhunter Achieves Mythic Status,10,2 March 2021,"You can't copy a Michael Mann film, especially one from his early days like this. They were raw, somewhat brutalist and always visually imposing. Blue and indigo hues set the tone for all his films. They were cool, as in both definitions of the word. The emotions feel occasionally detached, and it's there that you'd find more interesting illustrations of humanity.The opening dialogue between Will Graham (William Peterson) and Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina) plays out on a twisted piece of driftwood, and the endless ocean goes on before them. Jack proposes for Will return to work, in order to thwart a brand new serial killer on the scene. Will agrees, and it's treated with such gravity. Music takes us through the aftermath of his decision. He constructs a turtle net with his son, while his wife watches on from their beachside estate, talking gravely to Jack about the choice he has just brought upon her husband. You see, Will Graham had already put away a similar murderer, Hannibal Lecktor (Brian Cox). He caught him at the expense of great personal risk, tuning his mind to think and see like a killer. This results in some of the more compelling character moments in the film, as Will often begins speaking as the deranged do.There's a creepy, utterly epic little dream sequence, where he's staring at his wife (Kim Greist) with these deep steely eyes. It's truly ominous. He wakes up in an aeroplane while the young passenger next to him begins crying at the sight of his work files; gnarly pictures of the deceased. William Peterson remains one of the most underrated actors ever, and he really hands in a great, layered performance here. Kim Greist is also really believable as his concerned wife, Molly, and I'm surprised I haven't seen her in more films. Everything Dennis Farina did was brilliant, and Brian Cox simply puts it over Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecktor to me. He's not blatantly unsettling, and is more realistic as a result.Like Mann's masterpiece Heat (1995), Manhunter too has the ability to tap into something ethereal. I think it's a testament to the musical score by The Reds and Michael Rubini. It's very dreamlike and often very powerful. I proudly contend that ""it's just me and you now, sport"" remains one of the best scenes in cinematic history. Watch it with the context of; Will Graham is risking his heart and mind to stop this man. It's the product of a stunning shot and stunning acting. Tom Noonan plays Francis Dollarhyde AKA The Tooth Fairy, an eerie character who could've simply been written off as one thing. But Michael devotes three dimensions to his nature. He sobs when he finally feels the love and affection of another woman (Joan Allen). He can't even bring himself to kill her when the time comes. There's a great explanation of pity from Will Graham; ""This started from an abused kid, a battered infant. My heart bleeds for him, as a child. Someone took a kid and manufactured a monster. At the same time, as an adult, he's irredeemable. He butchers whole families to pursue trivial fantasies... As an adult, someone should blow the sick f%# out of his socks..."". Jack Crawford reckons this is a contradiction, but will Graham's mind has been there before. He understands. Then there's the touching scene in the grocery aisle between father and son, where Will openly explains his condition and previous dark history with Hannibal Lecktor to young Kevin (David Seaman).You can lose your way in Manhunter, and slip into the world of Will Graham. It's harrowing and lurid this place, full of innate feeling, light and dark. The visuals make it beautiful, as do the performances by Will Peterson, Kim Greist and Dennis Farina. Awesome work, Mr. Mann.",Manhunter
216,ayamisr,a great movie,8,9 August 2016,"first I would like to point out that horror movies are not my cup of tea, I rarely watch them and even less likely to like them. then I would like to point out that I was born in 1989 so I missed all the great 1980s movies but what made me really oblivious of this movie is that it is not as talked about as the rest of the Hannibal movies which is sad.the film is great in every way and William Petersen did such a great job portraying the brilliant, on-the-edge-of-madness FBI profiler Will Graham and Brian Cox's Hannibal was great especially while interacting with Graham, everything in this movie is great and I am astonished at how little recognition it gets among audience. in the end, the movie belongs to a genre that I don't usually enjoy but I enjoyed it (mainly because I watched it in the morning and in human company).",Manhunter
217,billymac72,What? No Tattoos?!,8,14 October 2002,"I'm starting to think that I may be one of the only people who saw this film when it was originally theatrically released! Years after that, as a freshman in college, I was managing a video store when a woman came in looking for the recently released `Silence of the Lambs.' She said she knew William Petersen from childhood and told me that he was in THE first Hannibal the Cannibal movie. Having not read the novel or seen the movie for a while, I never related the two before that. But I specifically remembered `Manhunter' for its creepy killer, spectacular use of Iron Butterfly, and the strange & frightening notion (for then) of FBI profiling. These three details alone speak volumes for the film's acting, style and writing. The irony of forcing oneself to share the same maniacal thoughts as a killer in order to catch them is the stuff of nightmares. Since reconnecting with `Manhunter' back then, I've remained a constant fan of the film.But the film suffers today in several ways. First off, any comparison to `Silence of the Lambs' is going to come up short. `Silence' is simply a better film  a classic of the highest caliber that will continue to sustain itself with the passage of time. Those already acquainted with Jonathan Demme's world will probably have a hard time accepting `Manhunter.' But audiences should judge the film on its own merits, and recognize that unlike `Red Dragon' it was not designed to resemble an established world of a classic movie  which is both a curse and an advantage for both films. I recently saw `Red Dragon,' by the way, and loved it. Walking out, I found myself asking whether I liked it better than `Manhunter.' These comparisons can get very silly because not only am I basing my impressions on a book, but also a previously filmed version and a closely related `sequel.' Best method: let each stand alone, THEN decide if either was successful. Both films succeed for similar and different reasons. The approach of  `Manhunter' is much more cold and observational than `Red Dragon.' This style (often concerned with widely symmetrical composition), like Kubrick's, can greatly benefit the story if used properly. I really liked it here. The neatness and sterility of the 80s décor also works perfectly in this format, providing a nice contrast to the horrors sometimes contained within its walls. As for the music, it has not aged well. The synthesized stuff in the first hour is effective at times (especially when it's just a single, sustained note a la John Carpenter, or those bits that sound like `Blade Runner'), and the inclusion of In-a-Gadda-da-Vida is inspired, but the electronic balladry during Dolarhyde's romance is simply awful and detract from the scenes. Obviously, the danger of using such modern music is that it can become outdated and cheesy very quick.  Is it just me, or does this especially seem true of 80s music? Given Michael Mann's career, he clearly wouldn't agree. I guess one never knows. The Tangerine Dream score for `Risky Business' or Phillip Glass' for `Thin Blue Line,' for example, still hold up remarkably well from this period. The performances, however, are still wonderful. Petersen (whom I've heard didn't like the job he did) reaches just the right blend of seeming haunted, detached, morose, and as Dolarhyde describes him, purposeful. Dennis Farina, himself a former Chicago cop, exudes realistic authority as Jack Crawford. Tom Noonan obtains a disturbing childlike innocence and deliberation in his terror. And Brian Coxpoor guy, will always be compared to Anthony Hopkins. It's unfair because he gives us a Lecter that is different, to be sure, but intelligent in a way that, to me, is more realistic, intriguing and ultimately frightening. Hopkins' Hannibal is so supremely horrible that he's practically supernatural at this point, not unlike Dracula or the Wolfman. I enjoy all of that too, but just on a different level. 8/10",Manhunter
218,drsecond,Interesting,7,24 January 2002,"This is a beautifully filmed movie with great acting.  Tom Noonan is especially good in this.  Unfortunately, the film is marred by extremely slow pacing.  It seems that so much craft was used in the filming of each shot made the editor and director less willing to cut out some of the fat from the movie.  Incidentally, the DVD transfer on this movie is one of the best I have seen, especially the audio.",Manhunter
219,g-white723,Budget serial killer movie with a great ending,6,8 February 2016,"This is a film which has its moments but in general there is budget feel to this - like it was made for TV rather than cinema. That is why I marked down to a 6/10.As I mentioned in the title the ending is superb and very dramatic. One of my favourite endings to a film.This film is precursor to all those Hannibal Lecktor films that what were so successful in the 1990s. My understanding is that this film was based on the book 'Red Dragon', but they didn't want to call it that because people might think it was martial arts film. Hannibal Lecktor is played by Scottish actor Brian Cox in a more subtle way than he would be portrayed in later films. The main stars though are William Peterson as Will Graham, the mentally scarred man-hunter. He would go on the make that role his own in CSI, and Tom Noonan as the very scary and believable serial killer nicknamed the 'tooth fairy'. These two actors deliver memorable performances and elevate this low budget movie into a cult classic.Not quite as accomplished as Silence of the Lambs but still worth a watch.",Manhunter
220,zingbot,The Original and Best Lecter Movie,9,19 July 2007,"""Manhunter"" is the less well known relative of ""Silence of the Lambs"", and unsurprisingly due to the success of the Jodie Foster/Anthony Hopkins' film, has never had the recognition it deserves in my opinion. Silence of the Lambs is a very good film, with great performances and direction. I feel that Manhunter is the superior film for numerous reasons. The direction by Michael Mann is excellent, as is the superb cinematography by Dante Spinotti. The whole film has many beautiful touches, colour changes and moody schemes. Only in watching the documentary can you really appreciate the effort and thought that has gone into the film. The acting is brilliant throughout. William Peterson as the damaged FBI profiler is superb, he is on the edge throughout and the story focuses on his turmoil and profiling skills. Brian Cox is fantastic as Lecter. He comes across as extremely clever and manipulative, but is way more believable than Hopkins' Lecter, and as a result much more chilling. He is a true psychopath, rather than some superhuman monster. Tom Noonan as Dollarhyde is also excellent, after seeing him for the first time you cannot imagine anyone else playing the role. The film was one of, if not the first movie to really show the art of criminal profiling, and as a result is gripping to follow as the whole story comes into shape. The music is definitely stuck somewhere in the eighties, and does age the film to some extent. However this is not a problem, most of the music is good, and all is forgiven by the superb ending with Iron Butterfly's ""In A Gadda Da Vida"" pumping out through an incredible finale. Very highly recommended.",Manhunter

The rest of the cast is near perfect, i personally love the soundtrack/score, all in all a perfect 10/10 from me.Over and out.",Manhunter
222,hanselmerchor,"good script, interesting but lacking in several aspects",6,11 October 2002,"I was expecting better things of this movie.  The plot is great, and certainly the script was lacking nothing.  What I didn't like was seeing the microphone hanging over the actor's heads repeatedly. This takes so much of the realism the film tries to convey away.  Also, I don't know if anyone likes William Petersen, but as far as I am concerned, his acting in this film is quite poor.  The film delivers, if you are concerned about the cinematography and the photography, otherwise check something else.",Manhunter
223,ian_bell,Brian Cox proves that less is more,10,9 June 2010,"Released back in 1986, and disappearing without trace at the box office, Manhunter brought Hannibal Lekter to the big screen, and perhaps more importantly, showed just how nasty he can be without any form of violence.As two families are murdered a few weeks apart in the southern states of the USA, the FBI make a connection to a lunar cycle and realise their killer is following a pattern. With a deadline imposed, the next full moon, and no clear leads, FBI chief Jack Crawford, with some desperation, pulls a retired agent out of the field.That retired agent is Will Graham (a compelling William Peterson) who is faced with the unenviable task of having to go and meet Dr Hannibal Lektor in order to try and gain some insight into the mind of the killer (the 'Tooth Fairy') they are chasing.For my money the scenes between Graham and Lektor are every bit as good (if not better) than those between Starling and Lector in Silence of the Lambs.The key difference here is that Michael Mann never allows the tension of fear to ebb away between Graham and Lektor. As Lektor (Brian Cox) sits on the edge of his bed, his dark eyes never moving from the young FBI agent, he is conversational, even pleasant with Graham. He talks about aftershave, and about various magazines. Then casually asks for Graham's home telephone number. Never has such an innocuous request been delivered with such underlying menace.As Graham and the FBI continue their hunt for the 'Tooth Fairy' ( a similarly impressive turn by Tom Noonan) it is Graham's growing mental turmoil which underpins the film. Reluctant at best to help his former colleagues, he is furious to find his wife and stepson targeted at one point, and as the clock ticks down toward the next full moon and the leads dry up one after another, you can sense the growing frustration build in Graham. This is not a man on a career mission: he does not even want the job. But as he tells his wife partway through the film 'It's gotta stop! (meaning the murders).One small but key scene comes early on aboard an overnight plane. With the crime scene photos laid out on his lap, a dozing Graham is jolted awake by a stewardess. The passengers are asking to be moved, unnerved by the content of the photos.It is these small touches by director Michael Mann which give the picture its heart. Lektor is not a cool icon, despite what Silence of the Lambs would have you believe; he is what Graham describes him as at the start of the film. He is 'insane'.That said, there is something undeniably fascinating about the power which Lektor exerts from his cell. Brian Cox's lines are hardly more than The Terminator's, yet he uses them just as shrewdly. Contemptuous of the authorities which hold him behind bars, and mistrustful yet oddly respectful of his nemesis Graham, Cox's Lektor is a man with time to burn, and a score to settle.By contrast, the 'Tooth Fairy' is indeed a tortured soul. Resentful of society, and brutalised by a childhood which sadly the film does not touch on (for that you need the book), Tom Noonan brings depth and even sympathy to a character who has already murdered ten people before the film even starts.Better or worse than Silence of the Lambs, the comparison makes no difference to Manhunter. It is mightily impressive from beginning to end.",Manhunter
224,Dr-RJP,"""Manhunter"" is Bill Peterson's movie and his coming out party",10,18 October 2008,"I saw this movie before ""Silence,"" and quite frankly, neither Cox nor Noonan did anything meaningful for the characters they were playing. This movie is all about the birth of a young star who would be picked to lead the most successful TV franchise in history, and become the prototypical FBI profiler for every show and movie to come out since.Just as Michael Mann changed the TV landscape with ""Miami Vice,"" by melding MTV-type music videos with kitsch, cops, and fast cars, Mann also foretold the future of all forensic crime dramas with the introduction of a young William Peterson, who I would argue was born to play GIL GRISSOM .Am I the only one who sees the parallels, beginning with the similarity in name? GIL GRISSOM/WILL GRAHAM. Not at all coincidental.If Cox had been given the time and the acting latitude that Tony Hopkins was handed on a gold platter, who knows how much better he could have been as Lecktor.Noonan's character was somewhat frightening in the scene with the Tattler reporter, but compared to the average bad guy in Criminal Minds, he could be mistaken as the Easter Bunny.Let's face it. ""Manhunter"" was not so much the first debut of Hannibal Lecktor as it was of Gil Grissom and the sheer level of emotional intensity that a top-notch profiler has to personally invest in every bizarre and bloody case he tackles.Take away the loud and annoying 80's music. Leave in InnaGaddaDavida, and ""Manhunter"" is a masterpiece for all time.",Manhunter
225,DeviousMrBlonde,Cheese please...,5,30 October 2002,"I haven't watched Red Dragon yet so I don't consider myself biased one way or the other. This movie was a complete disappointment. I've been reading all this commentary on how Red Dragon is a bad remake of this good film, all I can say is Red Dragon must be complete tosh so.I can only agree with the comment already posted that it's a case of ""Miami Vice"" meeting a thriller. The dialogue is completely cheesy and the music had me all but reaching for the mute button. I can't believe people praising the acting, it's generally atrocious!! And as for the over the top ridiculous lighting. Terrible.The movies one redeeming factor comes in the towering form of Francis 'Tooth Fairy' Dolarhyde. He is genuinely creepy and acts the part very well. Otherwise it's one to miss.",Manhunter
226,Cinema_freak,"Real and intense, may feel a bit dated for some.",10,29 December 2015,"As much as I like ""The Silence of The Lambs"", this is the starting point as well as the best movie of the whole series. Michael Mann is one of my favourite directors, particularly due to movies like this and ""Heat"". He has that conspicuously distinct style of his own.William Petersen plays criminal profiler Will Graham. He at first seems awkward, but later after he meets Hannibal Lecter, you realize that he's more of a troubled personality than it seems. Brian Cox's Hannibal ""Lecktor"" seems more real than Hopkins' characterisation, that's what makes him scarier. He's supposed to be a psychopath, and in real life, psychos don't show signs of being psychopathic, they act normal; they just don't feel for anyone else. Tom Noonan as Francis Dollarhyde is a sociopath in just the same way as Lecter is a psychopath. His peculiar appearance and build adds to his mystique.The score is pure '80s, like when ""The Big Hush"" plays in the background in Noonan's bedroom. I liked it personally, maybe because it evokes some of the nostalgia within me.The cinematography and direction are top-notch. Tints are heavily used in scenes according to different moods. Some scenes, e.g. when Graham imagines how Dollarhyde went on with his murder and why he used the mirror shards (when the victim's eyes light up) were genuinely unsettling. The forensic lab scenes were also great, when they catch up with one clue and run on to examine another one. It adds to the realistic charm of this movie.""Manhunter"" can bring out some very polarized opinions from the audience, and that's understandable, most complaints being with the movie's pace and apparent datedness.For me, though, it's a 10/10 psychological thriller, an under-rated classic. This movie is meant to be watched alone, preferably at night.Edit: After re-watching this movie and ""Silence of the Lambs"", I can say without a doubt that ""Manhunter"" is the superior film.",Manhunter
227,Waiyan-1999,Two people on the different sides of the same coin!,9,28 June 2019,"The Visual!!! It is too powerful in Manhunter, my first encounter with acclaimed director Michael Mann. Colors, film-noir aesthetic, shot compositions and camera movements, they all are not only stunning to look at but also creat such a staggering mood and moved me beyond any word can describe. My tension, excitement were at their highest the whole time beacuse of how great the storytelling was and I haven't felt like that in a while with moviesI don't think I can continue this review without mentioning it's predecessor The Silence of the Lambs because I kept comparing Brian Cox's Lecktor to Anthony Hopkins's Lecter, William Petersen's Will Graham to Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling, Tom Noonan's Francis Dollarhyde to Buffalo Bill throughout the movie. They are really different from one another, it just that the whole plot structure and characters between the two are kind of similar that I can't help but do it. All the performances here are really fantastic with Noonan in the seat of antagonist standout.While not unsettling as TSL, Manhunter is a great crime thriller movie and a unique film in it's own ways. The two are on a par with one another.",Manhunter
228,Han-10,Signature Michael Mann,7,29 July 2001,"Michael Mann's style in ""Manhunter"" is unmistakable:  Lots of wide two-shots of people conversing while staring out over an expanse, simple electronic music resonating over entire sequences, and a general feeling of emptiness that hovers over every frame.  If ""The Insider,"" ""Heat,"" and ""Miami Vice"" are your cup of tea, you'll thoroughly enjoy this film.I've always had a problem with Mann's pacing.  His films feel like epics, but none are especially memorable.  Even ""The Last of the Mohicans"" managed to make an interesting story monotonous.  In ""Manhunter,"" Mann had some of the best material you can get.  I rifled through Thomas Harris' ""Red Dragon"" faster than any book I've read and it was riveting from beginning to end. The film lingers on character beats for so long that sometimes you lose interest in the story.  I was also disappointed with the end of the film (don't worry, no spoilers).  It left out the book's clever and surprising final act and resorted to a been-there-done-that action-movie close.  Some other major elements of the book were left out, one that revolves specifically around the ""Red Dragon"" painting.  Did they need it in the film?  I'm not sure, but having read it, I really missed it.  I guess that's why they named the film something else.William Petersen did a fine job 90% of the time.  He did capture Will Graham's distant lack of hope for humanity.  His similarity with Lecter, the ""Tooth Fairy,"" or presumably any criminal he's persuing clearly disturbs him almost as much as evil's general presence in the world.  However, Petersen becomes unconvincing when he walks through the crime scene and becomes flat-out angry when he stumbles upon a realization.  ""Ya looked at 'em through the window, didn't ya, ya son of a b----,"" he snarls.  I didn't buy it.""Manhunter"" is a decent film, but it is far less superior to ""Silence of the Lambs"" to which it is often compared.  Far less tense, infinitely less frightening, though there are some scenes that I'd classify as ""creepy.""  It also should be noted that having seen Anthony Hopkins play Lecter first, Brian Cox left a huge void in the Lecter experience.  It's not really a fair comparison, especially since Cox did it first, but imagine seeing Lecter portrayed by someone besides Hopkins and you'll know what I mean immediately.Grade: C+",Manhunter
229,FishBibble,You had to see it when it first came out... To fully appreciate it.,10,6 October 2019,"Mann is a brilliant writer/director, and unfortunately he was a little to head of his time on this film.I was a teenager when this movie was originally released, and it seriously disturbed me as a kid. Seeing a serial killer in a movie was rare enough in the mid-eighties, but to show the thoughts of a serial killer basically, putting the audience in the frame of mind was just so far from anything else at the time. So watching it was disturbing, which I think for people who missed this, they had that experience with Silence Of The Lambs. So that is the division of the reviews I see here.
If you saw this when it original came out then it almost certainly left a big impact, and likely you realize how important and groundbreaking this film was. Which is exactly what reviews seem to say if they like the film.
If you saw it years after first seeing Silence Of The Lambs, the impact, for many reasons, cinematography was based on a much lower budget, production levels in general were lower, and seeing it after seeing all the films that ere inspired by it, loses that sense of originality and that is going to decrease your experience of the film.
But as many have said, this film, being first in many ways deserves the same level of acclaim that has gone on to Silence Of The Lambs. It had only a small box office unfortunately. I think as the studio was actually scared of pushing it at the time, it was so different than anything they had seen the time, and the subject was so dark. If they had I think it would have been hugely well received.Overall because of budget, and having this movie as a template, Silence Of The Lambs is a superior film, but that is because the director had this movie to understand how to make a movie of this genre, and Michael Mann was basically creating it with his film. And some have said Tom Noonan was better than Anthony Hopkins, but I actually think they are equal, and i give props for Demme and Hopkins not going for the same feel as Noonan's a and Mann's portrayal, so bravo to both as they are the two most important films in the genre in my opinion.Do i recommend seeing it now, if you haven't seen it yet, then yes, but only if you keep in mind that you are seeing a movie that has been copied many times since, if anything at all feels cliche, trust me, it was as far from it when it first came out. And so that is hard to do, but if you can do that, you likely will start to get how important a film this was.",Manhunter
230,tyguy-2,Uneven serial killer adventure,5,16 August 2002,"An FBI profiler is called out of retirement  to find a serial killer.  And like agent Starling in Silence of the Lambs, he enlists the help of one Hannibal the Cannibal Lechter (Cox).  One would immediately expect the movie to revolve around their uneasy arrangement.  However, the focus of this movie is on his efforts to find the killer.  We see Lechter only a few times and the inevitable comparisons to the Hopkins' Lechter are really unnecessary. But here we go anyway...... He's not quite as creepy and in this movie he is stored in a clinical atmosphere rather than in the grimy dungeon featured in the Silence of the Lambs.  The serial killer is your typical predator type but is not nearly as weird as the guy in ""Lambs""..... no bizarro-naked dancing this time. The plot is a notch above your standard detective fare and we get some interesting lighting and camera work. However, this gives the movie a dated TV movie look (as does the 80s clothes and hairstyle).  Although,I must admit, the 80s styles look better than the 70s if you're keeping score.  Manhunter is worth looking for if you are interested in the Hannibal serial.  Otherwise you are not missing much.",Manhunter

The soundtrack is so out of place, totally unmatched to each scene, and it's unrelenting. It sounds like a student experimental film toying with musical ideas that don't work. One of those student projects that just scrape through with a pass grade. I laboured through this film and couldn't wait for it to be over. Compared to the modern remake with Edward Norton, this is a huge disappointment.",Manhunter
232,meslon,Everyone Seems to Have Missed the Point,9,26 December 2003,"Manhunter was as good if not better than all the glitzy Hopkins' films. William Petersen was excellent as the Ex Psych ward patient come FBI profiler. One of the first profilers I can recall in any movie. Here is where people seem to have missed a major point. The torment Petersen's character has gone through coupled with the torment he must endure once he does take the case. I am surprised that no one mentions this very important plot Detail. I loved this movie. With low budget stars and a budget probably 1/100th that of Hannibal, SOTL or Red Dragon it turned out to be 100 times better. Michael Mann, underrated and stuck with the ""Miami Vice"" television Kiss of Death makes the Over-Rated Ridley Scott look like the Hack he is(without Foreign Backdrops and big name screenwriters and Big Money) Scott is a director lost in his own ego(take the Director's cut of Blade Runner)he destroyed a perfect movie for egos sake. Mann makes the character's into the Human Animals they are supposed to be. Scott(in Hannibal) makes schlock; who of you would have had Hannibal chop off his own hand? I have cuffs on and I am cuffed to an FBI agent-Most definitely I am going to cut my hand off. Yeah Right!! Watch Manhunter. Forget the rest. An 8.5 out of 10. I am loathe to give a movie higher ratings. Throw in Mann's great use of music and give it an 8.9/10",Manhunter
233,anders-rock,Surprisingly great,9,22 April 2012,"I have not read the book Red Dragon that it's based on nor seen the remake of that name so I can say that I am fully capable of judging this movie on it's own merits. And I was surprised to see how much I got into this film. One thing that caught me was the main character Will Graham played by William Petersen. Petersen played the part really well and displayed the tortured psychology of the character perfectly so you really didn't feel that Hannibal Lecter's (or Lecktor in this film) words about him were empty. Brian Cox as the legendary cannibal was very different from Anthony Hopkins in Silence Of the Lambs. Where Hopkins was theatrical and let the insanity show, Cox was a lot calmer and down to earth when he analyzed Graham's psyche and that made it seem very realistic. While I do enjoy Hopkins portrayal as well I found Cox's interpretation to be refreshing after having seen Silence... so many times. And the villain Fracis Dollarhyde was scary and unpredictable while easy to sympathize with. I loved that character. I have no idea why this movie bombed at the box office. The creepy atmosphere, the compelling story about a man on the edge of insanity and the strong performances made this a winner.",Manhunter
234,fredsab,"The First, the Best",9,21 June 2003,"I never appreciated the brilliance of this film until I saw the Silence sequel and Red Dragon remake.  Apart from William Peterson's intense performance, the highlight of the film is unquestionably the mood and atmosphere created by Michael Mann.  Compare Lector's jail cell (wonderfully underplayed by the talented Brian Cox) to the cell of Hannibal in Silence. No rugged stone walls, no theatrical dim bulbs, just a brilliantly lit scene that you might expect from a hospital room/cell, and much scarier because of its ordinariness.William Peterson starred in two of my favorite movies of all time, the other being To Live and Die in LA.

235,KeyC0de,Excellent Psychological Thriller,9,10 January 2018,"This is a great intellectually engaging psychological thriller movie. Suspence and thrill is ever present and intensified by the selection of music, eerie personna of the protagonist Will Graham (William Petersen), Hannibal Lector and others. Acting is overall pretty good, although not the best, because I find some moments over-racted. For example, I don't find that convincing that Will uncovers everything during his investigations and speaks it out loud for everybody to hear. Maybe it's just me, but it is a minor annoyance I have with the film. However I absolutely love and feel the conversations he has with Hannibal, some very deep meanings are uncovered though those and you get to understand the very well written characters. Michael Mann's direction is brilliant. Don't think that it's going to have huge criminal takedowns and the like, eg. if you don't catch the criminal the entire world cliche is at stake. Mann directs the actors to discuss amongst themselves meticulously all the key details before an important scene. I love that. Cinematography is beautiful, further enhancing the dramatic feel of the movie. The plot is very well laid out. Pacing is good; I analyzed it, and I don't think there are any loopholes; it's solid. The 2h duration is acceptable, but a second viewing will probably be required in order to understand everything. Brian Cox as Hannibal Lecktor delivers, he's spot on (not as iconic as Hopkins in the Silence of the Lambs though, but 2nd only to him). The tooth Ferry (Tom Noonan) acting is disturbing and unsettling perfectly fitting to the character. I thoroughly enjoyed this film; if you like action, thriller, mystery, crime genres you'll love it.Rating: 9/10 - Great",Manhunter

I was only willing to watch it because I'm a Joan Allen fan and she's in it, but I still kept thinking that nothing could be better than 'Silence of The Lambs'.  I was wrong. Although 'Silence...' is one of the best psychological thrillers ever, 'Manhunter' just excels in every way (except that it hasn't Jodie Foster).  I never, never saw a movie so intense, so constantly exciting... Brilliant photography, the most thrilling music ever and great performances.  There were plenty of moments that made me feel really uncomfortable, just like the main characters.  This is a real masterpiece and it makes a mediocre movie like 'Hannibal' even worse.

237,panquin,An okay movie that means well but dies of overstylization,6,23 October 2006,"The raw materials of a damn good film are here, but Mann's typically awful (and I mean hideous) musical choices (at least for his 80s movies) are on full display in Manhunter, and the first bit of remedy would be to chuck every song and piece of music, bar none, and either (1) don't feature any music or (2) bring on the musical subtlety (not Mann's strongest point). Then I would shake the actress playing the protagonist's wife, an entirely unbelievable and utterly annoying Hollywood-style wife, and jettison her, rewrite the part and make that character way marginal. Lastly, I'd give in to the story and shed the endless reams of style that are - yes - taking up the story's space, to quite annoying effect. All of these remedies would help make the movie less about Michael Mann and his direction and more about the story that direction is supposed to be...well, directing, you know? And I guess that's problem #1 with Manhunter: it's more about the director than about the unfolding supposed-to-be- engrossing story itself.What's amazing is that Hannibal Lecter doesn't scare in the slightest, and suspense just isn't happening here. Even revulsion isn't happening, and it should be present in bucketfuls. There just isn't any hit to the gut that the movie's working (supposedly) to give you. Very disappointing. I just wish I hadn't bought it. Oh well.",Manhunter
238,invincible_seattle,The first of the series is still the best.,9,9 October 2002,"I watched this film for the first time about a year ago, shortly after watching ""Hannibal.""  While this film was far less violent and gory than its two sequels, I felt more terrified after watching it than ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Hannibal.""The greatest plus for this film is the fact that for the most part, it uses actors who were not big names in 1986.  William Petersen, who played FBI investigator Will Graham, is best known today for his role as Gil Grissom on TV's ""CSI.""  But his humane approach to investigating the savage murders by the ""Tooth Fairy"" totally sold me that I was watching Will Graham, not William Petersen.  I felt the same for Dennis Farina, Tom Noonan, Joan Allen and Brian Cox, the first actor to portray Dr. Hannibal Lector.The scenes of Graham working the case to himself are among the best in the film.  When he begins piecing the profile of Dolarhyde together, it all comes together with the audience as well, making us a part of the FBI team as well.Dolarhyde, who unfortunately doesn't get a lot of screen time, is seen only as a psychopathic monster; a tragedy which fortunately is corrected in the 2002 film ""Red Dragon.""  The demise of Dolarhyde in this film, I feel, more appropriately justifies the feel of the film; in his small home, isolated in the forest, with Iron Butterfly playing the psychadelic 'in-a-godda-da-vidda,' which is a total contrast to ""Red Dragon,"" where he doesn't die in his own home, but Grahams.Forensic work is taken far more seriously in this film than any other in the series, enhancing the suspense and heightening the fear that this guy probably won't be caught because he's too smart.No movie will ever faithfully mimic the artistic qualities of a novel; but close renditions, mixed with creative tangents, may make it just as enjoyable.I gave this film a rating of 9 for its near perfect execution of acting, not only verbal, but emotional.",Manhunter

Unfortunately this movie was a sleeper and most people missed out.  If you have seen and enjoyed ""Silence of the Lambs"" then you should find this as fascinating to watch.  This is the prequel to ""Silence of the Lambs"" and will give you insight into the man who put Hannibal Lekter (Also spelled Lecter) in jail and how the brilliance of Will Graham (Played by William L. Peterson) was capable of capturing Lekter.  The brilliance of Will Graham is believable, hence only a very intelligent detective and script played in this fashion could pull this off.  Note, Hannibal Lekter was originally played by Brian Cox III.  This a great movie, don't miss it!This film was made five years prior to ""Silence of the Lambs"" in 1986 and when I seen it the first time I knew it was a classic.  Our villain this time was ""The Tooth Fairy"" who at monthly full moons liked to kill entire families, Will Graham is called out of retirement to assist in the case. He visits Hannibal Lekter to pick up the scent so to speak and get into the mind of the killer so he can predict his next move.  Hannibal has already been behind bars for three years and Will Graham retired after capturing him, it took Will Graham three years before he felt mentally stable and had received lots of psychological help during this period and has started living a normal life with his wife & son.  It's was only because of Will Graham's willingness and honor in the call of duty that ""The Tooth Fairy"" had better learn to cover his tracks, after all he has disadvantages, the same weakness has Hannibal Lekter.

Ralph Fiennes is a great actor and does a good job as the serial killer. But Tom Noonan, in the earlier film, was much more as Thomas Harris had depicted in the novel. For one thing, Noonan was a very large man and, if I remember correctly, was really bulked up for the role. He also had more of a ""scar"" than the later version. These two things made him more monstrous than Fiennes, who was a far more sympathetic character.Peterson was good as Will Graham though I think his and Edward Norton's interpretation of the character were equally fine.Noonan being slain b y the special bullets in the climax, was almost word-for-word, action-for-action, from the novel.This all said: I liked both movies... but I liked ""Manhunter"" a bit better.",Manhunter

Manns visually fascinating style gives the brilliant script the edge it deserves. In this haunting movie a police-officer has the ability to think like the serial-killers he hunts. This leads him into schizophrenia - isn´t he as mad and dangerous as the killers? This is the question of this movie - and Mann´s answer is a razor-sharp analysis on identity. The movie starts off really quiet and calm - those who look for action and gore are definitely in the wrong movie - but those who like psychological, intelligent thrillers will be glued to the screen until the closing credits. If you´ve the choice, watch the director´s cut, it´s final scene will make you freeze.

His film does such a better job of explaining the villain's motives, the detective's trials and tribulations, and the process of solving a crime. Plus the plot/action is so much more believable. I even prefer Brian Cox's Hannibal Lechter. If you've never seen this, rent it now!After ten years of refusing to watch the remake, starring Anthony Hopkins and Edward Norton, I finally succumbed. I should have kept the embargo intact. Everything about ""Red Dragon"" lacked the nuance, pathos, and mood of Mann's classic. Only a perverse curiosity to see how badly they butchered the original kept me watching ""Red Dragon."" There are a number of reasons why ""Manhunter"" has a cult following and years after its release served as the inspiration for the acclaimed CSI television series and successful spin-offs. William Peterson opened the door for public appreciation of forensic science and Michael Mann made a cerebral and emotive movie. The other two related movies lack the subtlety, the multi-textured fabric, and the pacing of the original. Unfortunately, that's probably why so few people ever went to see ""Manhunter"" in either of its cinematic releases (remember, it was reissued as the prequel to ""Silence of the Lambs"").The general public needs to be bludgeoned over the head and this amazing movie does anything but.

247,rolotomasi_70-398-336619,The Immanent Nature of Life & The Absolute,9,17 November 2012,"Though it appears to be a film about a serial killer and death, Manhunter is a film primarily concerned with the immanent nature of 'life' and the absolute. The symbolic allusions to eastern thinking in Manhunter are manifold. It appears to deal with the very nature of enlightenment itself. There are markers all over. It is a film peppered with clues which make the viewer as much the forensic detective as Will Graham himself. I mean, look at those gleaming white offices, that sparklingly white cell of Lecktor's, Lecktor's all-white uniform, the sedated tiger, the inflorescence that pervades to the very core of the film straight from the strangely alive opening titles; even the architecture is grounded in the complexity of curves and ethereal whiteness.Some of the clues reveal the essence of this oriental philosophy here:The killer distorts his face deliberately with a stocking; he pens a letter which speaks of his great 'becoming'. His home is cosmically decorated with maps of galaxies and nebulae. He is obsessed with seeing, a seeing that Mann reinforces all the more by introducing a woman who is blind. Perhaps the clues are too many in fact. There seems to be too much information that eagerly seeks the approval of Mann's hypothesis: that seeing is both the key to enlightenment and the escape from darkness.Even the killer's death scene lays him out in the form of a butterfly, suggesting the eventual chrysalis of the killer's mind into the realm of nirvana. His becoming is realized in death. His macabre death pose is oddly peaceful and reminiscent of Jarmusch's later squashed haloed head in Dead Man.In amongst all the talk, two key and very short dialog scenes stand out above all others:The scene with Lecktor on the telephone, where Lecktor explains to Graham why he felt depressed after killing someone.We don't ask for our natures, they're issued to us along with our lungs, our pancreas and everything else. Why fight it? Didn't you feel so bad because killing him felt so good, and why shouldn't it? Lecktor asks.And the scene just before the last act when Graham discovers how the killer knew so much about the family's home security, where he says to Jack, (Dennis Farina's character):My heart bleeds for him as a child. Someone took a kid and manufactured a monster. At the same time as an adult he's irredeemable. He butchers whole families to pursue trivial fantasies as an adult someone should blow the sick fu#k out of his socks.Do you think that's a contradiction Jack? Does this kind of understanding make you uncomfortable?As the killer achieves realization in death so too does Graham appear to achieve it in life. It is said that everyone achieves nirvana at the instant of one's death. The key, though, appears to be able to self-realize whilst still alive. Graham, with his epiphany in the hotel room, appears to do this.Moreover, and perhaps more obviously symbolic, the film is book-ended in the oceanic space of the Pacific Ocean, and the great peace of water. It is this absolute emptiness upon the edge of which the Graham family stands at both the beginning and the end of the film. The ocean itself represents 'before birth' and 'after death'. It is, in effect, oblivion, (a symbol that Mann uses later on in 'Heat' in a pivotal scene with Robert Deniro)Whether it is Manhunter's lighting or sound score, everything points to this oblivious and mystical aspect that underlies all life. Yet unlike many blatantly mystical films Manhunter never lingers on its symbolism, and never appears contrived. It helps that the central performances are solid and believable, whether Petersen as cop, or Noonan as killer; or the periphery characters of Graham's wife, Kim Greist, and the son, or Brian Cox as Lecktor, and Farina as the other cop. The casting agent should have got an award for assembling such a marvelous and capable team.Together with The Keep and Thief (and to a certain extent, Heat), both interesting (and sinister) films in their own right, Manhunter represents Mann's trinity that explores the circuminsessional penetration of all things, enlightenment, and the darkness of ignorance.",Manhunter
248,simonrheath,Good Use of Iron Butterfly's In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,8,16 May 2005,"Manhunter is fantastic - it is far superior to its re-make Red Dragon(which raises the question, why re-make a classic in the first place).I think Mann uses music perfectly in this movie. In the final scene Mann uses Iron Butterfly's "" In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"". Not only is the song rough and jagged which was perfect for Dolarhyde's preperations for his next victim, Mann sets up the music to climax once Will sees Dolarhyde preparing to murder his victim. The music climaxes as Will runs through the forest and bursts through the large window with sharp piercing electric guitar blaring as shards of glass fly everywhere. Mann achieves a perfect combination of audio and visual effects. The song is perfect for the final showdown between the hero and the villain.As a final aside, Iron Butterfly's album In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida is a good listen for the 17 minute version of the title track - this California band also plays some shorter rock/pop tunes.",Manhunter

252,TheFilmGuru,IT TAKES ONE TO CATCH ONE -- so let's REMAKE this turkey !,7,1 September 2001,"Michael Mann's 'pro-law enforcement' mania by side, we really, really NEED a 2002(?) 're-make' of this very flawed film. It's good, I gave it a ""7."" Just for the ""infectious"" corrupting 'mirror-image' relationship between the FBI profiler and everyone's favorite ""gentleman, genius, cannibal"" ! But there are so many serious problems one wonders if Mann even read the fascinating novel, Red Dragon. ""Cheesy title"" being a relatively minor flaw ! Contrary to all prevalent reasoning that only Anthony Hopkins CAN successfully play ""Lecter,"" it is NOT Brian Cox's very fine performance of that ""very intelligent"" 'monster' with ""completely no moral sense whatsoever"" (See Cox's commentary on DVD) which is so appalling !First, who is ""Dollarhyde"" (""Dollar"" ???) -- it's ""Dolarhyde."" A telling 'Freudian slip' perhaps -- as to De Laurentis's initial motivations in this first of the Thomas Harris ""Hannibal"" trilogy ! That is, before his much more aesthetic decisions concerning HANNIBAL (2001), after missing out on SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (1991) ?  Second, who is this Dr. ""Sydney"" Bloom, of the University of Chicago ??? A serious flaw for those with a deeper insight into the name of ""Dr. Alan [!] Bloom of the University of Chicago,"" as is used throughout the trilogy of three novels (= 3 movies, to date). Here, I need not even go into the directorial decisions concerning endings, of which only Demme's ""Silence"" pretty much adheres to the sense of the fantastic literature which inspires this series. But one may seriously question why, after going to all the trouble of getting that high-color tattoo onto Tom Noonan's back, this visual element (from the non-visual media of the novel !) would NOT be used after all, in the essentially audio-visual media of cinema !?! Apart from how this reinforces the very important  less-literate/less intellectual (than a ""Hannibal Lecter, MD"" !!!) in the psychosis of the ""Tooth-Fairy,"" inasmuch as concerns the late watercolor illustration(s) of Revelations (12: 1-4) by the English poet William Blake, Noonan's 'good' performance might have been 'great' ! (See the imagined scene in Sean Penn's THE PLEDGE for a later example of this actor's abilities as homicidal maniac !)
Lastly, the amusing serendipitous situation of the Shakespearean actor, Brian Cox, giving us our first (bone-chilling) glimpse of the ""embodiment of the Nietzschean Superman taken to one of its logical extremes"" (Film Critic, Todd R. Ramlow, for ""PopMatters"": ""Hannibal Lecter, C'est Moi"") in 1986, while the Shakespearean actor, Anthony Hopkins, was doing ""King Lear"" in London -- and Cox's doing ""Lear"" in London while Hopkin's was so masterfully 'creating' HIS ""Lecter"" in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (1991) -- IS very funny !
Oh well ! Let's all hope Ted Tally (""Silence"") shows the kind of respect for the Harris novel it deserves, in the remake: RED DRAGON ! And that Anthony Hopkins can manage this 'prequel' ! -- He assuredly can, see: HANNIBAL !",Manhunter

254,mike-3905,Pound shop Hannibal movie,5,5 February 2015,"It's OK if you simply want a reasonably accurate film of the book, perhaps in the background while you do something else. There are occasional good moments and performances but no real consistency except for the dated soundtrack (which must have sounded old even in 1986) and Miami Vice aesthetics.What is lacking is the drama and suspense fans will be familiar with from the books, other films and recent TV series. It's not bad or wrong, it's just not very good. There's not much else to say and I'm not saying don't watch it just don't be disappointed - as I was, having read quite a few more positive reviews.",Manhunter
255,vin_moran,Really bad,3,13 February 2007,"Having read the book and then watched the film I have to say Manhunter is a masterclass on how to cock up a good script.The acting is plastic and unbelievable, the 80s soundtrack ruins any potential emotional effect, the over-lighting refuses the imagination any opportunity to be scared, the experiences and motivations of Mr D are not portrayed (why he is who he is), the end of the film differs badly from the book (and the re-make Red Dragon, which is far closer to the book's roots) and essentially the film lacks any point.While i could write a thesis on why i think this film is bad, ill just go over two really annoying points.1) The main character, Will Graham, is poorly acted. There is no empathy. You never fear for him. You never care for him and he does not appear vulnerable - something essential to understanding the internal fear he feels around Lektor and Mr D. And the scene where he bodyslams Lounds onto a car is pure cheese-ball film making. Laughable.2) And this is the nail in this films coffin: No time is spent examining Mr D, the serial killer. In the book he had a hair-lip (not represented much better in Red Dragon the film), in the film he has a mild shaving blemish. The hair-lip was central to his character and life experiences and essentially made him what he was.He feels disfigured. This is central to the emotions the audience needs to feel when he meets Reba and finally feels 'normal' after experiencing love making.His subsequent fear of speaking publicly and isolation and descent into what is broadly termed as 'schizophrenia' is essential in evoking pathos for his character. He is 'becoming' a monster but he was not born a monster. Red Dragon the film at least tries to address this (without huge success). The lack of examination into his psychology makes his crimes almost motiveless, and his death meaningless as we see him only as a destructive animal with no internal conflicts.Basically, i would only recommend watching this film as a study. Read the book, watch this film and then watch Red Dragon. If you're like me you'll love the book, be disheartened by a poorly representative Manhunter and pleasantly surprised by Red Dragon.",Manhunter
256,fugacity2000,"Great, up until the ending",8,13 July 2003,"This is an outstanding adaptation of the book, ""The Red Dragon"" by Thomas Harris.  The mood is great; it's not the lighting, or any one thing, but there's just a sense of doom and foreboding throughout the entire film, something that the recent ""Red Dragon"" was sorely missing (although it, too, was good).My biggest problem is with the ending.  It just felt like the director decided he'd spent enough time on the movie, and wanted it over with.  It felt like a cheat, and diminished everything else in the film, which was such a really good setup to a final confrontation between Graham and Dolarhyde (i.e., good vs. evil).  Such is life; so many movies seem great until the ending.  It seems like writers have a harder time closing their movie out than bringing it along. And I'm probably spoiled, but Anthony Hopkins will ALWAYS be Hannibal Lecter; Brian Cox wasn't even close to being sinister enough.",Manhunter
257,anirog,A stunning film,9,8 February 2010,"Manhunter is an amazing film, we as the audience are not treated as fools, not everything is fully explained or laid out, it contains no throw away dialogue in case we forgot what is going on, all is told through breathtaking imagery and acting, I do not have to see the gruesome details of horrific crimes in order for me to have an emotional response, like the classic shower scene from Hitchcock's Psycho a lot of what we see is implied, at first we only see a silhouette of the attacker we hardly see any blood, we don't see the knife puncture flesh, yet it is still disturbing and horrific.William Petersen excels as the main agent working to track down this vicious serial killer nicknamed The Tooth Fairy, and Brian Cox gives a truly chilling performance.",Manhunter

It is a shame that this movie didn't get nearly the attention it deserved and was overshadowed by the sequel (The Silence of the Lambs) 4 years later. I have to say that I was impressed by Brian Cox's portrayal of Dr. Lecter, even though it does not compare to the legendary role that Sir Anthony Hopkins plays in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Hannibal"".  However, since Dr. Lecter is not the key character he is in the two latter films of the trilogy, it was not necessary to make the him as captivating.",Manhunter

Farina delivers his usual good, solid performance as Crawford, Stephen Lang has a great time with the Lounds role, Noonan is (to my mind) mesmerizing as the Dragon and Brian Cox deserves a round of applause as Lector, even though Tony Hopkins trumped him solidly in ""The Silence of the Lambs."" I recommend this film to anyone who has a fascination for the ""Hannibal Lector"" series as well as for anyone who has a taste for forensics and criminal investigation. The original novel, ""Red Dragon,"" is far more complex than this version manages to convey, but then anyone who has actually read ""Gone With the Wind"" should realize the limitations of translating a complex piece of writing into film.All in all, a great, great ""B"" movie.

Clearly I had underestimated Michael Mann. I thought this was an excellent film, very clever visually, and with a great soundtrack. The acting was remarkable - William Petersen brilliantly interprets the character of Will Graham, and Brian Cox very subtly, but unnervingly, assays the background role of Hannibal Lecter [known here as Lektor]. It is not flawless - it is a very '80s' film in some regards, and has dated - but overall it is a remarkable and thoroughly entertaining thriller. Brett Ratner, Edward Norton & co. have got a lot to live up to with their proposed remake, but I, for one, very much doubt they can top this film.9/10",Manhunter
261,Tom_Benton,"Flawed, occasionally boring, and yet ... excellent.",7,29 June 2004,"Michael Mann took a break from ""Miami Vice"" in 1986 to produce this cult classic. ""Manhunter"" has been unfairly dismissed as ""that film with the other Hannibal Lecter"", while it is in fact so much more. Adapted from Thomas Harris' first Hannibal Lecter novel, ""Red Dragon"", ""Manhunter"" involves Will Graham (played by ""C.S.I.""'s Will Petersen), an FBI agent, who is called out of retirement to help track down a mysterious serial killer nicknamed ""The Tooth Fairy"" (Tom Noonan).First, the cast. Will Petersen is a perfect Will Graham. Dennis Farina is also an excellent Jack Crawford. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast is not so good. While Noonan makes ""The Tooth Fairy"" pretty creepy, the rest of the cast (including Brian Cox, who plays imprisoned cannibal Hannibal ""Lecktor"") brings out some horrible acting.One of the reasons ""Manhunter"" is so cool is its close resemblance to ""Miami Vice"". The production design has a trademark ""Vice"" glitter to it, and the soundtrack is outstanding - also a ""Vice"" trademark. Mann takes what would normally be a dark crime-thriller and turns it into a shining thriller.Michael Mann's direction is probably the best part of the film. He has the techniques and he knows how to use them, long before making hits like ""Heat"". Without Mann, the film would likely not have been made, and if so, would have much less cult status. ""Manhunter"" is flawed. Occasionally, it's boring, and it has a very unsatisfying feel to it. And yet, somehow, unexplainably, and going against everything I've just said - it's excellent. Dated, and very ""Miami Vice""-ish - but we love it.""It's just you and me now, sport.""",Manhunter
262,sansans_enscene,Manhunter Review,7,28 January 2019,"The best music or the best film sequences I ever experience do not attract me because of it's attempt to address a topic, political or personal, or a movie's exposition. It was never about the 'what', but rather the 'why' and especially the 'who'. Michael Mann's third feature film Manhunter (1986) understands what I consider the most important factor in any piece of art: conveying emotion. This is not done with dialogue in movies, not by lyrics - though it can be effective as well - but through mise en scene, how each shot carries onto the next, how a quartet of strings might swell, and perhaps how Michael Rubini's score exposes our hero's fears as he prepares to confront a deadly series of murders and home invasions.Manhunter is about a serial killer nicknamed the Tooth Fairy found in Thomas Harris novel 'Red Dragon.' It follows the path a scarred detective must take to put an end to a serial killer who is known to leave bite marks on his victims.This movie should have been kept in Mann's desk drawer for about 5 more years and made then, when he had the production value to go along with it (I would gladly replace The Last of the Mohicans for this!). This movie felt amateurish but definitely not rushed (except for the last shootout sequence). That is to say that Michael Mann did not have the gun powder he needed to enlist a crew that would allow his visions of 'Red Dragon' to come to life. Albeit William Peterson who played the hero Graham was convincing enough most of the time.I believe that Michael Mann had such a crisp notion of Manhunter. Here is a film, made by a not-so-hot director and line-up, that kicked off the movie with the sharpest and most harrowing cut I've seen in a long time, which is an unexpected cut to a master bedroom, walls and furniture sprayed with red over a cream-white stage. This happens after a very well directed and well scored sequence, in which Graham enters a victim's house, taking mental notes of each detail. As he makes his way through the living room and up the stairs, Graham's surroundings, and consequently ours as well, felt extra-terrestrial, fantastical, and just down-right scary! The score performed by The Reds complimented the pure, dark blue camouflage of the house's interior. The synths penetrated, and the bass dragged your heart beneath, twisting the music of the 80's but making it relatable enough to cause us unease. How thrilling is a movie when its primary focus is the attention to the character's fears and senses, thereby engulfing ours.Manhunter felt like more of a teaser to his more successful and professional work Heat (1995) which starred Al Pacino and Robert De Niro and a slew of top crew members. I did like Brian Cox's appearance as Hannibal Lecktor as well as Joan Allen's feline. I mostly appreciated its confidence to keep the movie at its pace and the artistic decisions it made. I recommended it to anyone who has a taste for mysterious detectives, heavy synths, and Hannibal Lecktor! Overall, 2-hours were well spent.",Manhunter

While the change in the title was requested by the studio that produced the movie, it is completely appropriate because while the story remains faithful to the source material (the ending is the only major change), this is absolutely a Michael Mann film. The look and soundtrack of the movie is far more Miami Vice than Silence of the Lambs and the film is all the more interesting for it. The later film adaptation Red Dragon, starring Anthony Hopkins in an enhanced capacity as Lecter than seen in the novel, is a pale comparison to Mann's engrossing take. Brian Cox's performance as ""Lecktor"" (as the film calls him) is a slimy, devilish trickster and does more with the role in the limited screen time he has than Hopkins is able to bring in the later film.

Brian Cox does a reasonably good job, but he does not project the aura of pure evilness that Hopkins did. Although William L. Peterson's Detective Graham is more human than Jodi Foster's Starling, he was not as interesting as an actor. And the music felt a little manipulative; as if the story weren't scary enough, you needed eerie and ominous music.But the story was scary enough that you didn't need the ominous music. The characters in this one, with the exception of Lecter, seemed more human than they were in Silence of the Lambs. With SOTL, one could not relate to the bad guy; he was just a really really sick individual. But with Manhunter's Dolarhyde you could see how he had become that way. ""There but for the grace of God go I"" is a phrase that comes to mind. ""You know how you caught me"" Lecter says to detective Graham ""Because we're alike, you and I.""By the way, the subtitle ""The Pursuit of Hannibal Lecter"" is misleading; Lecter is already in jail when the film starts, and he stays there.",Manhunter

William Peterson is excellent Will Graham, putting a lot of feeling into the role and outdoing Edward Norton who starred in the same role in the remake. The backing cast all perform capably, but Peterson makes the movie. Brian Cox' version of Hannibal manages to trump Hopkins' later portrayal.

While Ratner's movie wasn't bad at all, it completely pails in comparison. There's an attention to detail with Mann that goes way beyond Ratner's ability. Could Ratner ever direct the Insider with the precision and audacity that Mann brings? I doubt it. Not to mention that the cinematography by Spinotti is stellar. The whole movie, Manhunter, crackles--where as, Red Dragon smolders. Even the synthpop music in Manhunter, somehow, works masterfully. The whole adventure had me captivated for the entire time. And, I'm not even getting into the acting.Frankly, Brian Cox is superior, in my mind, to Hopkins who I love. But, Hopkins is Campy. There's something off with his portrayal of Lector/Lecktor. It's a tad bit contrived, while Cox seems like he's in his own element. Don't get me wrong, I think both portrayals are very good, and, frankly, I could get hypnotized listening to both. With that said, there's something truly disturbing with Cox in this movie that goes beyond Hopkins. Anyway, watch this movie. I think you'll like it. I only watched because I love The Insider so much, and I'm glad that I popped this on one day last year.

271,darrenyaates,Great mid 80s psychological thriller,8,24 July 2018,Michael Mann is a stylish filmmaker and his take on the Hannibal Lector saga has his stamp of authority. It is a pity that in the deluge of praise for Silence of the Lambs(which is a great film indeed) this film is almost forgotten. Because it contains some great qualities. The acting is uniformly excellent- Brian Cox infuses Lectar with a different approach than what Hopkins brought later and Will Graham is expertly played by William Peterson. The scenes between the two are really good. Pacing is excellent and the soundtrack is one of the finest mixtures of sound and visuals in all cinema. Is this as good or better than Silence of the Lambs? Some think so. You be the judge.,Manhunter
272,rmlattimore,Manhunter stands on its own merits,9,20 August 2009,"I always liked Manhunter. It's a different movie than Silence of the Lambs, in that, to me. Manhunter was more of a police procedural while SotL was almost a horror movie. I thought Manhunter was way more subtle, particularly in terms of Brian Cox' Lecktor (which is, for me, the most memorable performance). I will never forget the ""disadvantages"" dialogue, which is in the memorable quotes section. Or the ""you're so sly, but so am I"" line. There is virtually no overacting in Manhunter; I particularly liked the dry discussion of body armor vs. the shooter's propensity for a head shot. Beyond that (and acknowledging how unfair it is to compare the two), they're two different movies that are both very good in their own way. If anything, Manhunter is more believable; Buffalo Bill had Clarice cold in SotL, so for her to escape was the one point where the viewer's intelligence was questioned.",Manhunter
273,Terr32,"Slightly better than Silence, far better than Hannibal",10,10 February 2001,"After recently watching all three movies, it is very clear that Manhunter, although the smallest in scale and lacking the 'big name stars' of the sequels is best. Yes, it is done by the same guy who did Miami Vice, but he just so happens to be a great and stylish director, Michael Mann. I love how he incorporates images and music into one cohesive force that is SO much more effective than the full frontal images and unimaginatively graphic scenes that the movie Hannibal resorts to. What a disappointment that film is. There is not one scene where I was scared in Hannibal, although there were plenty where I was disgusted. The same can be said of the Friday the 13th movies, too. Anyways, in my humble opinion, the best performance of any of the actors in the trilogy is William Petersen, as Will Graham. I believe that firmly. Understated at times, almost claustrophobic, he unveils a powerful character by the end. Brian Cox, who plays Lector, deserves special mention, too. In the few scenes he is in, he is remarkable. Again, he goes the understated route rather than the over the top style(though still very enjoyable) of Anthony Hopkins. The film has amazing scenes, all the more powerful when seen in widescreen. I loved the finale especially. It is pure perfection. As much as I admire Silence of the Lambs, I like Manhunter just a bit better.",Manhunter
274,wct3630,Splendid,10,23 February 2001,"Nothing more than reiteration of what has already been said.  Michael Mann's 1986 masterpiece is the greatest serial-killer film ever made. It is the perfect combination of art and craftsmanship.  SOTL is competent enough. Demme is a fine craftsman.  He sets up shots well.  His employing of the extreme close-up, SOTL's trademark, was effective.  But he is no Michael Mann. Although clearly no hack, Demme isn't nearly the artist that Mann is.  Hopkins was fine, though Brian Cox (who, by the way, was considered for Silence) is truly Oscar worthy.  Foster was effective in her Oscar-winning performance, but she is much better in The Accused, Nell, and Taxi Driver. 
William L. Peterson was stellar, creating a man in Will Graham who is toeing the line of psychosis just like everyone else.  Tom Noonan's Tooth Fairy is a brilliant, multi-layered characeter, far outstripping the one-dimensional Jame Gumb of Silence. Joan Allen, Dennis Farina, and Kim Greist were also superb.Manhunter is four stars. Silence is two and a half stars.",Manhunter

I was scared once, and it was a false scare.  The music was inappropriate for a thriller(and I am an 80's nut), the acting wasn't great, and the whole thing felt like Miami Vice.

It's superior in every department. Sure it looks a little dated now but that's what gives it such a stylish look. Even the sound track is great. This movie seems to get a fair amount of criticism on this sites reviews but that is because people who see this film after having watched Red dragon and Hannibal are disappointed that this is not filmed in the same style. I would argue that this is a good reason to dislike the more recent movies. They are not a patch on this. My advice to anyone who has not seen Red dragon or Manhunter is to watch Manhunter. It's a perfect example of how good a cop/serial killer film can be when it's done right. One of the best films of the 80's  9 out of 10.",Manhunter

After watching RD and Manhunter, I realized that they are the same film. DUH!!!! for me. However, RD and MH were both disappointing. Although Brian Cox is a great actor, in this film he didn't pull off Lecktor's character like Anthony Hopkins did in S O T L. But William Peterson was magnificent as the tortured FBI agent. Overall, Manhunter was a little better than RD but not much. In RD, Anthony Hopkins was too mechanical and Edward Norton was not right for the part he played. Manhunter was more dramatic and scary than RD, and for that I gave it a 6-just above mediocre. In my book, not worthy of having in my DVD collection.

I never want to see another hue of purple or pink in my life. I think I'm going to have to admit I just don't like Mann as a director. I have never seen one of his films that I have thought was even half as good as they are said to be. I don't know if perhaps they just dated and more fashionable and vibrant at the time. I saw a few reviewers say this was one of their favourite films of all time and the only way I can think that's possible is if they had only seen 5 films and the other 4 were directed by Mann. Am I being too harsh? Well the end of the film had the main character fly through a glass window to save a blind girl from being killed by the harelipped psychopath who promptly strolls over just in time to catch him mid air by the neck and throw him to the ground, he then shoots out the lights with a shot gun before shooting two more cops who literally run into his line of fire like they couldn't bare to eat one more meal of meatloaf with their dried up old hag wife back home.

The screenplay is neat,complex and disturbing and Mann's use of Cinemascope,locations,colors and music is great as usual. Dante Spinotti's camera-work is inspired and beautiful and all the performances here are great: William Petersen,troubled,strong and ambiguous is the PERFECT actor for Graham's character and Tom Noonan's performance is also very impressive,Noonan is at the same time chilling and moving,almost likable. The supporting actors are good too,Joan Allen is a wonderful and beautiful Reba and Brian Cox is quite good and more subtle here than Anthony Hopkins in HANNIBAL and RED DRAGON! The dreamy and surreal mood of MANHUNTER is really haunting,greatly enhanced by Mann's clever use of songs: all the scenes between Tom Noonan and Joan Allen,underlined by the Shriekback's score,are really amazing! MANHUNTER is a too underrated film,another great work from Michael Mann and a much better film than HANNIBAL and RED DRAGON,and it's even a better film than the famous THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS...see this film!",Manhunter
280,grantndownie,Great Psychological Thriller,8,2 March 2005,"I was unaware of the existence of this film for sometime which is why i found it such and intriguing watch. ""Red Dragon"" despite being a credible prequel to ""Silence of the lambs"" is inferior in a number of ways. Manns direction creates an uneasy sinister overtone that is maintained throughout which is enhanced by the tacky 80's soundtrack and set design. The film concentrates on the character of Agent Graham and his inner demons before introducing his nemesis Dollarhyde late in the film cleverly constructing tension between them. Noonen is much more convincing as Dollarhyde and looks and acts far more out of place in social terms than Fienes did. William Peterson is strangely excellent as Will Graham too.He manages to brilliantly portray a flawed hero, his neurotic tendencies making him a first class agent but drawing closer and closer to the personality of the killer. I have never been overly impressed with his performances in CSI but maybe in younger days he just tried harder. Dennis Farina is also good in support. But lastly what really gives the film its edge is the relatively brief performance of Brian Cox. Although most will agree Hopkins played the part better in ""Silence of the Lambs"" the other films which he reprised the role in where almost parody's of the original character. Cox play it as an evil, superbly intelligent character who you are genuinely afraid off. The tension during his scenes is notable.",Manhunter

I had seen the new Red Dragon with Edward Norton before, which may have been the reason for my resentment. But we should all really just face the facts here: it had a terrible script, this Hannibal Lecter sucked, when it got to a suspenseful moment it just cut away, and it appeared to be on an incredibly short budget. I'm not really a fan of Norton, but I must say he did a much better role than the guy in this movie. All of the actors seemed like they just picked them off the street and bribed them with enough McDonald coupons to play the part. It had a good plot though, but it was based entirely on the book, so all I can say is ""kudos to the author!""",Manhunter

What personally hit me was the way in which you find yourself drawn towards Graham (the cop) at the same time as he is aligning his thoughts with Dolarhyde...Therefore, the question remains - as this film was _so_ good, why was ""Silence..."" so rubbish ?

As I am in love with 80's movies I can't help but like this, but I must admit that it is Will Petersen who saves the film from being a fiasco. The other actors and the dialog are not very good. And I realize that the synthesizer was a great achievement in the 80's, but to have a ""scary synthesizer noise"" in the background at almost every scene the first 30 minutes was not really a good move...There are some good scenes, like when Will runs of the white prison. But unfortunately the ending scene is a letdown. After 2 hours of very slow action and no suspense scenes at all you could expect more.I find the ending very neat; Will has a pair of extremely short and 80's style pink shorts on, and a turquoise shirt. Instead of enjoying what is supposed to be a touching end scene, you giggle in awe of the abysmal taste in clothing everyone must have had 20 years ago.Still worth a watch though, but don't expect too much.",Manhunter

He doesn't look or sound right for the part of a charming yet crazy serial killer. Also Will Graham isn't played as well, neither is the Red Dragon himself. Thank God they re-made the film with Anthony Hopkins. I think that Anthony Hopkins is a far better actor and Lecter. He sends shivers down your spine before we even see him. The story isn't as good as in Red Dragon either, mainly the ending which is totally different to the book and lacks the excitement and danger that we want. I would recommend that instead you watch the modern version Red Dragon.",Manhunter

Every time I see this movie I enjoy it. It's let down a bit by some overblown 80s rock music contained in the soundtrack, and some of the fashion from the era is hard on the eye. However, other parts of the soundtrack are really good - ambient music that really adds to the mood of some scenes. The look of the film is generally stylish - typical Michael Mann. All of the actors do a good job too. I particularly like the way the film depicts the investigative procedure - the slick way in which the FBI experts employ their brains and technology in trying to stop the serial killing.

292,agorelik,Manhunter is the actual culmination of Harris' ideas,8,1 April 2005,"The point of Harris' entire life-work was to force us into the process that his serial killers themselves are undergoing (at a much more disturbed and transgressive level, of course). We are intended ourselves to transform (in idea only, to be sure) into people who can begin to understand, however much we ourselves fear and loath the transformation, how Harris' serial killers think and feel.To some extent, we are beginners on the same path that Will Graham is farther along upon, that Clarice Starling starts upon and that Dr. Lektor, Dollarhyde, etc, are unspeakably far along upon. The narrative of the Harris books is a vortex upon which more and more people, beginning down that transformative path (sometimes with the best of intentions), do, in fact, transform from humans into something other than human (except for Will Graham and Dr. Bloom).Where Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal and Red Dragon all fail is that these three movies continue to keep us at a distance. We are not convinced that we ourselves could become victim to the vortex by these three movies. Partially, this is a function of Hopkins' over-the-top performance and improper displacement of the actual focus of Harris' trilogy: Harris focuses upon the agents, Graham and Starling, who begin the transformative process but end transforming in highly divergent ways.Moving from book to screen, the necessity of Harris' vision entails that the film-maker begin to transform us from pure observers or watchers into beginning to transform ourselves, to begin to fear our own attraction to power, to horror, to transgression. Michael Mann is able to do this, while Demme/Scott/Rattner are unable to do so, by the things in Manhunter that so many commentators hate: instead of plotting the movie solely as a police procedural (as the three other movies are), instead Michael Mann turns the movie primarily into a sinuous, constantly cryptic, meandering journey through the experiences (which we share) of Graham and Dollarhyde. The plot is irrelevant, the importance is that we draw ever-closer to becoming Dollarhyde.The driving music, the inherent attraction of Noonan's Dollarhyde (who has excellent taste in clothes, architecture, music and is himself a film-maker of sorts) are not superfluous as many believe but very much the essential core of the movie. We gradually become attracted to Noonan's inherent coolness, and identify ourselves with Reba McClane, the blind girl who begins an affair with Dollarhyde.This identification leads to what I believe is the central scene in the movie: when McClane rubs the fur of a drugged tiger. We, along with McClane, begin to feel, admire and even long for the power of the tiger. We, on some level, wish to transform into a tiger, into something other than human. We take the first steps of becoming Dollarhyde. And that is what is truly frightening about Manhunter.",Manhunter
293,davidthiel,For my money Manhunter is much better than Silence of the Lambs,10,18 September 2000,"Maybe it is because Michael Mann was associated with a flash and trash show like Miami Vice or maybe it was because of Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hannibal Lecter but Manhunter is not given the credit it is due. While entertaining Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hannibal is not as pure evil as Brian Cox. But the real key to Manhunter is its portrayal of its reluctant hero Will Graham done masterfully by William Peterson.  There is a tension lacking in SOTL that permeates Manhunter.  Will Graham is vulnerable in a way that the ambitious Clarice Starling is not (other than the fact that she is a woman).  Tom Noonan's Francis Dollarhyde is developed throughout (crucial to the spirit of a Thomas Harris novel).  The bad guy in SOTL is just a boogey man, evil but just a monster.  In Manhunter we have a relationship with Dollarhyde, he is present throughout.  Manhunter has been re-released to DVD, if you liked SOTL then you owe it to yourself to check out its predecessor Manhunter.",Manhunter

Although Manhunter had beautiful cinematography and excellent locations I felt the same way watching Red Dragon. There is nothing holistically wrong with this movie only that it does feel longer than the running time indicates. In the beginning of the film I thought some of the camera work especially the opening scene a little coarse. Will Peterson did a fine job but i prefer Edward Norton as the actor. There was only one main problem in the film that I did not appreciate and that was the final sequence where there was some weird editing done. Overall this film being one of Michael Mann's early films is not bad but I do not revel in it like some people I know who like it.

Several cops dead and others heavily wounded due to his reckless act barging in and trying to assault the bad guy unprepared. Will could also be killed during the fight, and the bad guy might even run away before the backup/SWAT arrive. He should've just let the professionals (SWAT team) do it and it would still be an awesome movie. *Sigh* What a needless stupid action finale to put in a such delicate and complicated crime flick.",Manhunter
297,derekcharles,The best film of its genre,10,24 October 2010,"Manhunter is the best 'serial killer' genre film I've seen to date. It covers the 'serial killer' phenomenon from all possible angles - from the killings themselves and the motives of the killer, to the manhunt and the effects it has on the agents tracking the killer. Each of these four angles could themselves be the sole premise for such a film and it's to Mann's credit that he not only manages to deal with each of these angles in a substantive manner but also skilfully weaves them together into a coherent story.The film moves at a steady pace and, while always conveying the urgency of the characters' actions, it never feels rushed. The process of tracking the killer is shown to us in meticulous detail right down to the unspoken rivalry and/or contempt that the different branches of the law enforcement system have for each other. And it's this last point that touches on that which makes Manhunter so clever and in my opinion better than the book itself.Everything important in Manhunter is subtly hinted at so it's left up to the audience to infer: Graham's ability to track serial killers (he's half-way there himself); relatedly, Graham's motives for choosing Lounds to lure the killer (whether he was aware of them or not); Dolarhyde's disgust/insecurity at his own physical appearance (and the root of his desire to kill). This is the true brilliance of Manhunter. Rather than force-feeding the audience, Mann recognises that the characters in this film are driven by their ability or inability to deal with their own psyches. The subject matter is therefore subjective and should never be clear-cut enough so that it can be explained in black and white.For those who say that there was too much focus on Graham and that the book focused mainly on the tooth-fairy, I will remind you of the film's title and to recognise the differences between this title and the book's. Mann quite rightly went his own way with the film. I've always felt that there's very little artistic merit in reproducing a book in film form - that's one step up from listening to a book read out on a tape.While on the subject of reproducing the book in film form, I'm unfortunately obliged to mention the more recent Red Dragon film. I noted that this far inferior film actually has a higher rating than Manhunter and it makes me laugh that a film so formulaic, coarse, and obvious (on all levels) should be held in higher esteem. But I suppose it stands to reason that if babies like drinking formula they want the same thing from their films.Manhunter is not just a technical masterclass in direction and writing but also in acting. Each character is fully drawn out by the actors and they each relate to the different characters in consistently different ways. Peterson has never been better as the introspective lead investigator who innately empathises with these killers and so understands how their profound insecurities can lead to murder. The progression of his character throughout the film is believable and quite expertly conveys to us his desperate attempt to separate himself from 'his man'. Farina is, as always, brilliant and as much as I'm a fan of Scott Glenn, the former's Jack Crawford is the grittier and more hard-edged. With every glance and eye-movement, Farina brings to bear his first-hand knowledge of what it is to be a cop doing his job under time pressure.Standing out from this excellent ensemble is of course Brian Cox as Lecktor. While there is some merit to Anthony Hopkin's unfortunately more renowned portrayal of the same character, his is undeniably a caricature of a serial killer and, therefore, not realistic at all. A serial killer must appear to be, by definition,a very normal person - that's how he manages to kill a 'series' of people as opposed to just one and then being caught! My problem with Hopkin's Lecktor is that he is quite clearly not fully there in the head and so even the rawest recruit from the FBI down to the Cub Scouts would be able to pick him out as suspect no. 1. Cox gives us something entirely different. His Lecktor is smart, charming, and beneath the surface empty, devoid of sentiment and compassion. Again, it's to Mann's, and the actor's credit that, by the time his three scenes are done with, we have an implicit feeling as to what may be driving this Lecktor as well as an uncomfortable liking for him.Three stand-out sequences to look for: 1) the 'walk-through' of the tooth-fairy's letter through the forensic process. Not a quick, flashy cut in sight. Instead we have a patient almost soothing series of scenes that convey exactly what the different forensic specialists do better than any film before it or since (yes, they each have their own departments and there is not one indication that Jimmy Price and co. carry a gun, let alone go tracking down the killers themselves!). 2) Graham's visit with Lecktor. A dream-like sequence where the two play the best mental game of chess I can remember seeing in a film. 3) Dollarhyde encountering Reba. Michael Mann at his best shows us in three scenes how the fantasy-driven psychosis of a serial killer can be shattered to the point that the real person beneath is partially and briefly exposed.File under 'Masterclass'.",Manhunter

300,CLewey44,They Don't Make em' Like This Anymore!,9,28 March 2007,"I am one of those people who typically leans towards the original version of a movie. To put it nicely, I hate remakes. Well, the same applies to this great movie. ""Red Dragon"" isn't even close to being as good as ""Manhunter"". To me, ""Manhunter"" is a contemporary classic in the truest sense. Michael Mann can do no wrong, and certainly hits the nail on the head with this flick.Now, this movie is 20+ years old, but ages perfectly. I will even go as far as to say I like this movie more than SOTL. That doesn't mean it's a better movie, just more favorable to me. ""Manhunter"" really is creepy, more than SOTL.The music is perfectly scary, the way Mann directed the cameras to cue when ""Graham"" flicks on the light of the bedroom of the first murder scene we see is so shocking. And really, this movie is probably the first of it's kind in regards to showing forensics, criminal profiling, and in-depth FBI usage.Another cool thing Mann does is when he uses the quick camera movements. I can't describe it really, but for example when ""Graham"" is slaying the dragon so to speak at the end, you see several of these quick camera movements. It's really interesting style and works great.This movie also gives us the introduction to one of the most diabolical villains in the history of cinema, Dr. Hannibal Lector. Not played this time by Anthony Hopkins, but brilliantly by Brian Cox. Cox does a wonderful job. Maybe not as good as Hopkins in SOTL, but better than Hopkins in ""Hannibal"" or ""Red Dragon"".Most people are disappointed to know that Lector is already in jail in this one, but that makes his character even more mysterious. All you know is that Special Agent Will Graham caught him and sort of how he caught him. That formula worked well with ""Manhunter"" and SOTL. But when he escaped and was on the lose, the movies sunk tremendously (""Hannibal"" and ""Red Dragon"").I highly recommend this movie. If you liked the SOTL series or ""Miami Vice"" or ""Thief"" or any other Michael Mann stuff, you will absolutely love ""Manhunter"". It will not disappoint. It really is a brilliant movie.",Manhunter
301,Kubrick7-2,What happens when people over analyze,1,11 February 2001,"Anyone who says this movie is better than Silence of the Lambs is just hopelessly trying to be different in that ""nonconformity"" way that was so popular with the Breakfast Club crowd.  This movie was AWFUL.  It was AWFUL before Silence of the Lambs, and it's still AWFUL.It must be noted, however, that Hopkins' interpretation of Lecter is fantastic, and comparison with Cox's is not appropriate.  The whole immersion in the 80's ""Miami Vice"" like atmosphere is distasteful to all but those who still watch Nash Bridges.For those who feel that the story behind Manhunter is ""better"" than Silence, you're probably right.  Red Dragon is a much more straightforward book than The Silence of the Lambs.  The books have undeniable similarities, but the addition of a FEMALE officer in Silence complicates issues, and creates more complex situations within the story.  The movie Silence exploits this well, but oftentimes to the dismay of the serial killer genre fan.  I see it as the kind of difference between Seven Samurai and Die Hard.  Seven Samurai is a great film...Die Hard is a good action genre film...but not a great film. Unfortunately, Manhunter isn't even a good serial killer film, it's just...ok...and the 80's motif swings it into the ""awful"" territory.
But that's just my opinion...I could be wrong.",Manhunter
302,andyniess,Take it on its own terms,8,30 January 2001,"As an adaptation of Thomas Harris' Red Dragon, Manhunter seems at first to be radically abridged in order to fit the film's running time. However, all of Harris' themes are here, conveyed in cold, stark visuals and William Petersen's introspective acting.  Hannibal Lecter is introduced here, and although Brian Cox gives an effective performance, it's a cameo role compared to Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal.  As far as I can tell, this was the first film to use an (ex)FBI profiler as its hero.  Compared to much of what it has influenced, (TV's Millennium, Profiler, too many movies to count) Manhunter economically shows us the dangers of gazing deeply into a psychotic mind in order to understand it.  Plus, the final confrontation sequence is a masterpiece of film editing.  Michael Mann's directorial eye is razor sharp, and this is an influential modern film noir worth seeing, or seeing again.",Manhunter
303,mobilmlbsfi,Ok but does not compare to the book or the 2002 movie,5,19 September 2020,"I can see how people have good memories of watching this movie! BUT its super disapointing to me. I think every main character was better portrayed in the 2002 movie. Maybe i just prefer those actors but most of the line delivery and the dialogue itself seems cheasy and like ist trying to hard. But the thing that annoyed me the most is the red dragon, Francis Dolarhyde himself. First off he looks realy stupid and you realy get no look in his past or his reasons for his murders. In the book and even the 2002 movie he is a realy interesting character but in this movie he just seems like a mindless slasher killer(in comparisson). Also the soundtrack is boring and they made some weird changes from the book. I probably wouldnt hate on this movie so much if the 2002 movie didnt exist but it does an it works so much better for me in nearly every way.",Manhunter

The plot is simple one crazy killer is on the lose known as the Tooth fairy.And only one special cop can stop him.The cast is a bit unknown but thats not a problem William Peterson is the the cop with a gift he can think exactly like a criminal.He plays the doubtful and does it well.He comes out of retirement to stop him.Tom Noonan plays the killer well a vicious man but somewhat harmful in ways.Joan Allen is a kind of a nurse in all of this and she plays it well aswell.Brian Cox is brilliant as Lecter Shifty verrrry shifty he holds the key to the murderer.he does it villianous and creepy.alright not as good as anthony hopkins but close enough.The screenplay is excellent brilliant cinematography and yes superb direction from Mann.Silence of the lambs is no where near good as this film.A true gem It really is suspenseful! so the big question is is it better than silence Oh yes!!!",Manhunter

After I saw it I had to walk through my house with a bat and make sure The Tooth Ferry wasn't hiding somewhere. The reasons this movie is was so effective was none of the characters were over the top campy. The profiler who had a nervous breakdown because he had to get into the mind of serial killers to catch them and he softly tells his eleven year old son; ""they're the worst thoughts."" When I saw this profiling was a new phenomenon. When they slowly explained why this killer was massacring entire families and staging them like an audience to his greatness; that made the near seven foot tall infeminate psychopath even more terrifying.

306,miserychastain2,"An atrocious, boring piece of tripe...",1,25 August 2001,"For the life of me I cannot comprehend what people see in this movie and why anyone sane could think it was better than Silence of the Lambs!! I first saw this in 1986 and I hated it. After Silence and Hannibal, they put this on DVD and I actually bought the 2 disc set (its now on eBay). I still hate it. The movie is slow, boring, and drawn out. The dialogue is cheesy and the acting is terrible, just terrible. William Petersen couldn't be more melodramatic and overacting if he tried. Brian Cox is unimpressive as Hannibal Lecter (Lecktor? as they call him in this one). Joan Allen, usually always perfect in her roles is unimpressive and insignificant character-wise. In all, this tripe plays like a bad made-for-TV film meets Miami Vice. But then again, Michael Mann directed Miami Vice, so there you go. The ABSOLUTE worst thing is the awful music score and the GODAWFUL songs!!The score does not fit the tone of the film, using InAGaddaDaVida to torture Joan Allen tortures the viewer more and that Heartbeat song at the end by Red7 is puke-inducing. As for the DVD release...BAD editing, the dialog misses the mouths of the actor worse than in Godzilla movies, the grainy picture quality is worse than VHS,etc, etc. There is no salvaging this in any form. I love films of every genre and movies are my life and I've seen thousands of films in my 31 years and this was and still is one of the worst pieces of cinematic garbage I have ever wasted 2 hours on (4 since I've seen it twice).

I've never seen so many spellings of Lecktor - we're reviewing Manhunter here. Not another movie, not the book. On the screen in the movie it's spelt Lecktor - get it right people.I've never had so many mixed feelings about a film. I said I'd never watch another Michael Mann film after the disappointment of Public Enemies and truly awful Miami Vice movie from 2006 - but I'd always wanted to see Manhunter so I put it on.Firstly the music is dated, awfully so. At times it feels so inappropriate we actually laughed out loud. Some of the acting, particularly from the main character's wife, is terrible and I swear she was reading from a cue card behind the camera at one point it sounded so wooden. Additionally, the music was sometimes louder than the dialogue, making it hard to hear what people were saying on screen - even on a quality 5.1 setup.The editing is truly awful. At times it just jumps and a character's head moves from one place to another with no transition. The continuity in the supermarket scene is awful, they move position next to the shelving mid sentence.The end of the film was rubbish and I simply don't believe a straight minded character would take the action he did on seeing the bad guy through the window. I've never read the book to compare.So, some bad bits, some awful bits and some stuff missing I would like to have seen. But I still give it a (very high for me) 6/10 - the story was really good and I wanted to watch to the end to see what happened.Definitely a classic and worth a look.",Manhunter

The revelation of this film is William Petersen, who is terrific as Will Graham.Michael Mann has made a handful of brilliant films (""The Last Of The Mohicans"", ""Heat"", ""The Insider""), but this one is his crowning glory.",Manhunter
309,iamjacksemail,A Film That Shows Its Age But Does It Well,10,18 October 2002,"Manhunter is an excellent film. It is not quite the classic that Silence of the Lambs is but is in some ways more interesting to watch and clearly antecedent to Jonathon Demme's effort. I have not read Red Dragon, though that is really irrelevant to a review of Manhunter, and cannot comment on the changes that Michael Mann made to the story told in the book. What Mann did do was construct a compelling and suspenseful account of a tortured man returning to the tasks that still torture him. Graham is in many ways a much more interesting character than Clarice Starling and one who gets by on his own abilities and not the bread crumbs dropped by a jailed psychopath. Cox is a wonderful Lector, cerebral, relaxed and humorous. The performance is not the same as Hopkins' but this is not the same Lector who we find in Silence. Mann's direction is stylized but successful in sliding you into the contest that is being played out between Graham and Dolarhyde. As with his other films, Michael Mann does a meticulous job of recreating a world in which his characters don't play out plot points but act out their lives.
William Peterson and Tom Noonan, two relative unknowns, inhabit the two central characters, bringing to life the pain and the desire that drives these two characters who are more similar than either would like to admit. They also do so without the spoon feeding of flashbacks and explanatory back story that tells you exactly why Graham is so reluctant to come back and why Dolarhyde feels he must become something more than he is. Like Buffalo Bill in Silence, Dolarhyde is given motive but not explanation. He is a serial killer. He has murdered two families. Noonan gives the audience a glimpse of the humanity that lies underneath what Dolarhyde is becoming but does not ever let us feel that this man is not dangerous or that he can stop the killing.SPOILERS AHEAD: DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW THE FILM ENDSThe ending seems to be a great point of contention with many other users. I think it suits the film. It may be very different from the book but I gather so is much of the rest of the film so perhaps the book's ending would not have worked. It may be a tad Hollywood but it is also realistic. Serial killers don't often get away with it. Eventually they are usually caught without ever even knowing the detective who will apprehend them, let alone threatening his or her family in any way.I have yet to see Red Dragon mostly because I feel it is pointless. I can go to the theater and watch a composite of Manhunter and Silence that faithfully retells the story of the book or I can stay home and watch to excellent, original films. It is not a tough choice to me.",Manhunter
310,morganjeffy,Pure Crap.,1,19 January 2003,"Better than Silence Of the Lambs? Better than Red Dragon? Are some of you out of you're freaking minds? It's average at best, and I'm being nice. Michael Mann is a good director, but this not his best work, and while Brian Cox does make a good Hannibal Lector, he's no where near the league of Anthony Hopkins. It's not even a good thriller, and that's pretty sad considering the fact that the book it's based on is probably one of the best thrillers in modern literature.  I do give credit to William L Petersen for giving a great performance, but not even he can save this piece of crap from itself.I don't know what is worse.

311,rampbjr,Perhaps the most underrated forgotten thriller of my lifetime,10,11 February 2003,"It's not often that a movie is put together so tightly that you become enveloped into it. Manhunter is for who ever enjoys a mystery with a tantalizing soundtrack. The pity part of this movie is that most people have seen Silence of the Lambs but forgot, or didn't see this first. If so, I believe they're idea of Hannibal would've been a much more precise one. Anthony Hopkins portrays Hannibal as he acts but Brian Cox BECOMES Hannibal. Without seeing Hopkins roll first I was able to establish a certain craving for knowing more about Hannibal overall. Just as in Jaws, Manhunter only teases your pallet with Dr. Hannibal Lector where ""Hannibal"" the movie throws him up all over you. The scene where they find the note in his cell is riveting! How they analyze it is intriguing. The believability in this movie is unparalleled. This is my favorite movie.",Manhunter

This generation does not know what fear Cox's put into viewers who did NOT have a prefabricated notion of the new and lack luster Hannibal played by Hopkins. Highlights that are NOT duplicated!!!... The cell, the awe scene with the guy on fire, the only movie to show you the investigators finding a note from a serial murderer!

314,borengsven,Dripping with style and substance,9,29 May 2015,"This piece of the Hannibal Lecter puzzle is a fascinating one. A highly stylized and beautifully shot psychological thriller of the best kind, brimming with the kind of 80's color scheme that still resonate to this day in the works of Nicolas Winding Refn (of ""Drive"" and ""Only god forgives"") Michael Mann brings the Thomas Harris book to life with a sense of respect, while still adding his own trademarked action heft; a believable realism amidst chaotic and fantastical events.The character of Will Graham in particular, recently played with golden intensity by Hugh Dancy in the ""Hannibal"" TV-series, is portrayed with a sort of quiet, brooding agony by the much underrated William Petersen.The score is also worth a mention, really adding to the suggestive atmosphere. Shriekback really complements the visuals and helps the film achieve that eerie cool that is Mann's signature mark.All in all, I truly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys visually haunting films, as well as casual viewers looking for a smart, psychological thriller with a little edge. Not quite as dark as ""Silence of the Lambs"", but more intense than its 2002 counterpart.",Manhunter

318,macdiogenes,one of the most effective movies,10,12 February 2001,"Manhunter is one of the most effective serialkiller movies of all time. Why? Because like in reality, the serailkillers in the movie (dr Lecktor and the Tooth Fairy) are not Darth Vader-like evil superantagonists for heroes to destroy, but disturbed members of the same society both you and I inhabit. The Tom Noonan-character (the Tooth Fairy) is described like a somewhat nerdy but inteligent oddball, whit a selfchosen distance from regular social life (e.g. he cant find mates in clubs and pubs). There is an abundance of that kind of characters in real life, many of you who read this is like that for sure. If you can relate to a villain, it ceases to be a villain, instead it becomes someone who just as easely could be you or I.The Lector-character (Brian Cox) is mean and manipulative, but in a childish and attention-demanding way. He is not a someone you would easely enjoy as a friend (not as Hopkins larger-than-life potrayal of the same character in Lambs and Hannibal), a person you would ostracize in the school- or workplace, and therefore a person you can understand why he is as he is (a self projected prophecy, if you like). Also he is someone you are or know, and not at all an alien pariah on all things good. As the antagonists are natural is the hero natural. Will Graham (William Petersen) is not your run-o´-the-mill hero or antihero, he is to competent to be a antihero and to unstable to be a hero. He is driven in his field of work, something that Mann has potrayed over and over in his films (e.g. de Niro and Pacino in Heat, Crowe and Pacino in Insider). His work is his life, but at the same time his greatest adversery, his greatest problem and ultimately it will be his death (but not in this film). Also this is something that isn´t unheard of in life, the pathology of the workaholic makes a great nuanced leading character. All this combined with the visual and audial (wich resembles Dario Argentos use of the two, cp. Suspiria and Terror at the Opera) makes Manhunter one of the most effective serialkiller movies, if not the most effective.",Manhunter

It just isn't possible to spoil what is already rotten. That's why every positive review here floors me. Gag!I haven't read the book. I've seen Red Dragon and was mildly impressed. This is why I could stick with Manhunter for over an hour before I became truly exasperated. The music was the first thing to grate upon me. But each scene sounded worse than the one before. I can't stress enough how misplaced and cheap the music was.The cast was fine, but they must have been misdirected very skillfully. I couldn't believe how silly they started to seem -- only compounding what is normally called character-development.

Dennis Farina (RIP) became my favorite Jack Crawford and Stephen Lang is way more hip than Philip Seymour Hoffman. As far as the killer is concerned, well.....Tom Noonan I liked better I guess.

But the difference between ""RedDragon"" and ""Manhunter"" is definitely in the roles of Will Graham and Francis Dollarhyde. William Petersen shows Graham way more intense and obsessed, Edward Norton is just too nice and does not show the intensity and the conflict of the character.

A slow boiling psychological thriller in which Michael Mann pulls off a clever trick in not showing us the Tooth Fairy until a good way through the film at which point you are bursting to see him.And is'nt Tom Noonan the perfect Francis Dolarhyde. He was born to play him.The book which is even better, strongly emphasises the sheer physicality of the character and his almost superhuman strength which makes me question the decision to put Ralph Fiennes in the new role.And William Peterson should have gone in to hyperspace after his role as Will Graham.One drawback is the ending.Read the book and you will know what i mean.",Manhunter

I understand, that it is really hard to stand by the genius of Hopkins in Dr. Lecter role, but I think that Brian Cox performance was rather pretentious, uninspiring and unconvincing. His speech was too fast with no pauses, it sounded more like Stewie from Family Guy rather than psychopath with 180 IQ, he definitely lacked charm and it didn't seem that he knows what he is talking about. He looked like a overconfident narcissist at best. I think this was the weakest part of the movie and Dr. Lecter should be the main character of the movie, but in Manhunter it looked like it is just a side role, outshined by other performances. I think that Petersen did a great job, maybe I even liked him more than Norton in this role, even if I think that Norton is a great actor. I guess Noonan was OK too, looked even creepier than a killer in Red Dragon movie, maybe just could lift a bit before the role to fit better. Directing was really good considering the year of production, except I couldn't appreciate the soundtrack which sounded like a cheap 80's blockbuster wannabe trying to fit the fashion of the zeitgeist instead of something more classic and universal which would be a better idea in a movie about a book with no certain timeline in it.",Manhunter

330,findlay-2,Manhunter - A low-budget 'Silence of the Lambs',9,5 June 2000,"Of course, Manhunter will draw many comparisons with the film of Silence of the Lambs but the fact is that both films are great in very different ways. The bigger budget sequel has inevitably entered the public conscience more than the previous film, what with Anthony Hopkins giving an over-the-top performance of Hannibal Lecter and the film itself giving outrageously gory special effects for a mainstream film. Yet, Silence of the Lambs is a magnificently put together film, well directed, scripted and edited.However, it is a crime that Manhunter has gone relatively unnoticed. A more restrained Hannibal Lecktor in Brian Cox and an appropriately creepy villain in Tom Noonan give the film an unsettling and disturbing edge. The main difference between the two films is that Manhunter actually gets beneath your skin and stays there for the two hours whereas Silence of the Lambs merely keeps you entertained in the same running time.Manhunter isn't perfect though. Although it is my personal favourite, the soundtrack is diabolical towards the end as are some of the editing effects (you'll know what I mean if you've seen the film).My personal ratings (out of *****) would have to be:****1/2 : Manhunter****    : Silence of the LambsRoll on Hannibal!...",Manhunter
331,worktogthr,Better than The Silence of the Lambs? You all must be joking...,2,2 February 2001,"I have read all 3 of Thomas Harris' books including Hannibal Lecter...the trilogy if you may. I read all of them before I saw the movies that based themselves on the books with the exception of Hannibal for obvious reasons. And I will immediately say this.  I love Silence of the Lambs both the book and the movie.  Take away the incredible performances in the film, and it would still have a great plot and be a decent or even good adaptation. But the performances were excellent and it was a GREAT movie.  I tell you this to prove that reading the book first does not create bias.  If the adaptation on film is good, I will like it.  Manhunter is perhaps the worst adaptation of a book I have ever seen.  It takes the story in the ""Red Dragon"" which is a psychological rollercoaster both in Will Graham's mind and the Killers mind and destroys it.  What we have with Manhunter, is a quite obviously Miami Vice influenced action movie that we would see late night on Cinemax.  Will Graham flipping Freddy Lounds onto the hood of a car breaking the windshield...i rest my case..I need not point to the boring generic shootout ending where the killer imitates Rambo before his unexciting demise.  Why do I say this movie is bad?  Not because the book was better, which it was...but because it totally left out everything that made the book great.  The book was named the Red Dragon...and now I know why they didnt just name the Movie that....maybe because the killer's obsession with the Red Dragon, one of the most interesting and important parts of the book (his immediate motive even) was no where to be found in this week ""Cop drama"". Also, there was no backround on why he became such an insane, confused, troubled person...the book clearly explains his insane grandmother who threatened him with castration, and most importantly how uncomfortable he was with himself...his appearence, his speech...he wanted to belong...he wanted to be accepted...it was through this character of the Red Dragon that he got strenght to commit these crimes...to show everyone that he was someone...the killer in this movie hardly existed...he was totally unimportant...Also..the novel showed how Will Graham also had troubles in his life...his wife's trouble with him going back to work on the case...his step son from Molly's past husband who died(which doesnt exist in this movie...its his son) and their relationship, and most importantly the thoughts of these mad men becoming an obsession to him, filling his head to make him seem even psychotic at times....  The ending of the movie was so horrible I nearly got nautious....the book had an exciting twist filled ending...the movie had a horrible shoot em up action movie ending...suprised i didn't mention Lector yet? that's because the story hardly involves him...that is also the case in the novel...however, Lecter's involvment is so much more valuable, psychological, and disturbing in the book..and totally unecessary in this movie...I give this movie a 2 out of 10...and I am being generous The only reason it scored that high is because it kept my interest the whole time because i felt i was about to be pleasantly suprised with a great sequence or two, maybe a great ending.  Boy was i wrong... this was a huge disappointment and I would love to see it redone with good actors, a good screen play, and at least a clue about the dynamics of the great novel.  I did not dislike the movie because no film can live up to the book. Thats not true (Green Mile, Shawshank redemption, Silence of the Lambs, all equal to their written couterparts in my opinion)I simply did not like this because it was a horrible movie. As far as I am concerned...this could have been a half hour or hour long episode of Miami Vice.",Manhunter
332,dandwh,Comparision to Silence of the Lambs,9,30 September 2000,"I think in someways this movie was better than Silence of the Lambs. Michael Mann's cinematography gave the movie a very interesting look and made it fun to watch.  Where Silence of the Lambs could be dark, Manhunter was full of color and movement.  Lots of intensity.  I highly recommend anyone who has seen and enjoyed Silence of the Lambs to watch Manhunter. Also the book Red Dragon is well worth the read.  You won't want to put it down.",Manhunter
333,hootiefan,i wish i seen this movie before red dragon...,1,3 November 2002,"so i could be lost in this half-hearted attempt at film making.  I bet if i didn't see red dragon, i'd be confused.  though it pales in comparison to red dragon, lets not focus on that; instead focus on it like an independent project.I was surprised at the fact that Michael Mann directed this movie.  He's made some good films (Heat, Ali, Insider), but this must of been made when he had an addiction to 80's culture.  I'm not going to rag on the style of the movie because it was made in the 80's, but man, i feel bad for the 80's generation.  Also, Mann's inappropiate use of music is also distracting. The ""love scene"" between Reba and the Toothfairy has the most gruesome music possible.  The slow-mo also is another horrifying choice.  The pace was just horrible.  The pace was rather fast; thus, not allowing proper character development.  Though at times it did slow down at the worst times.  The pace just lacks consistency.  And the title (not sure if it was Mann's idea), but only a gay porn could be successful with a title like ""manhunter"".The acting was sufficient.  They moved the movie along, and that's about what was expected from them.  They didn't have anything to work with other than moving the story along.  Character motivation is no where to be found. Characters just did things that I had no idea why they were did it. Brain Cox as Lecter, did an adequate job, not much was expected from him. Though he had this terrible English accent with a hopefully unintentional slur.All in all, this is story driven movie that lacks any redeeming qualities. Just watch Red Dragon.",Manhunter

(I own and love all three 'Hopkins' movies...) At first I thought this was a sickeningly bad ripoff of Red Dragon, but investigation has led me here... and, for some reason, some people seem to like it... I just thought the casting was incredibly poor (not even compared to Red Dragon; just in general), the character portrayals were agonizing, and there was one scene that was so amazingly bad that it bears repeating: The ""Will Grahm"" actor ran in long, silly circles to get down a long silly ramp, in a place that obviously isn't a psychiatric hospital, AND THE DIRECTOR SHOWED ALMOST THE ENTIRE THING. Just running, turning, running, turning, running (yawn), turning, running, running some more, and then some more running, just in case we didn't already get the idea. I think he was supposed to be portraying some kind of distress, but it was just plain annoying. In short: Watch Red Dragon, and try to forget that this movie exists. Just my thoughts. I'm going to turn it off now...",Manhunter

Anyway, this viewing made me question the last twenty minutes or so.  The movie progresses just fine until Will figures out who the serial killer is. But it is the night of the full moon. What made Will think this guy would be at home?  And what a nice home this killer has, given what he does for a living!  Why isn't this guy going after another family?

Analyzing the movie as a separate work, which is based on the novel but is not a mere reproduction of the book, it is possible to have a contemplative look about it, not just a comparative one. Thus, it is possible to judge the work by itself. The film's main character is the investigator Will Graham, owner of unique skills that is retired from the FBI. He is summoned to active duty to investigate a new series of murders and will count with the help of one of the psychopaths who he led to be arrested. The film describes this story in a too simple way, just touching the surface of the emotions of the characters rather than promoting a ""dive"" on them. Thus, the characters seem mere pieces of a game and not people involved in a plot that goes beyond the events we are told.

In fact, everything about the movie screams 80's, the bland acting, the boring story, that just drags along until the end, all set to a soundtrack that sounds like Tangerine Dream composed it.  The movie puts you to sleep for about 2 hours and wakes you up at the end. There are also many details that, though in the book, are left out of the movie, yet the movie takes you to these places without really explaining them.  The remake, or perhaps better called, the real version of the book Red Dragon, is the new movie Red Dragon.  Like the books, the movies fit together nicely, and what we really need now is the beginning of Hannabal Lector.  Thomas Harris did a nice job filling that in the novels, but the movies omit a great deal of it.",Manhunter
341,gregwombat,Bad movie with some good points to it.,3,8 September 2001,"(I do mention some plot points from the movie, so if you don't want too much revealed, don't read on)Good Points: The cinematography was pretty good at times, good usage of shadows, shooting from behind a person rather than in front, and using the whole screen with 1/2 of it in darkness. I also liked the music, contrary to many people's comments, because it just somehow fit the overall lameness of the movie. I was pleasantly surprised that all the violence was imagined and not shown on the screen. The viewer's imagination can take that and run with it - thus making it as scary as one wants it to be without ever seeing the perp actually kill anyone (except the one guy in the yard but not even really then).But, here's what's wrong with the movie, in no particular order:*    The ""stunning ending"" I heard about for the director's cut - where was it? Did I miss it? It was a lame shootout, and the guy took 5 hits in the chest before lamely dying and then there was no more to it. *    Why did Graham visit the family at the end? To 'feel' what it's like to be a serial killer? Lame. If he had converted himself and killed them - that would have been interesting. But don't show the family, and then the Grahams all happy-end on the beach. *    Hannibal was in no way freaky, and while the code thing was smart it could have been played slicker. *    All the ludicrous ""I love you"" scenes with the wife - whatever. Leave that stuff out. The one scene where she thought she was in danger - fine. But other than that, she could have been cut from the whole movie. Clarice Sterling didn't need a mate to make her movies work, why does Graham need props? *    Jack Crawford was totally underdeveloped and seemed like he was half hindrance instead of leading an FBI investigation. *    It was clear from the beginning that the videos of the families were important and that the killer either shot them (like a hired photo-guy for a b-day party) or processed them afterwards. Ooooh. Suspenseful. *    The killer had no decent motive. While they tried to explore his obsession with needing to be accepted, it was done in a lame way. Jame Gum in SOTL was a transvestite freak wanting a body suit. Good serial killer stuff. Hannibal likes to eat people. Excellent. But Frances just waited for a full moon and made dead people stare at him. Pathetic.",Manhunter

343,gnosis_x,A Fairly Mediocre Film and A Lame Adaptation of the Book,6,8 November 2001,"I'm not going to go TOO deeply into this film, as I believe my associates before me have already deeply analyzed the film. Having recently read through ""Red Dragon,"" I felt compelled to see the movie and see just how poor of an adaptation it was - I'm a cynical person, what can I say?The film - at best - was your run of the mill, utterly clichéd ""serial Killer on the loose"" film. The movie actually began pretty well, bearing strong likeliness to the book. A half hour into it, however, things began to really diverge from the book's flow and we are left with a tangle of scenes that seem to have very little flow at all. Acting was a little stale in several cases (William Peterson's attempts to seem enraged with the killer's thoughts are weak and are only comparable to a soap opera) and, while I know this is a thing of opinion, I was completely unsatisfied with Brian Cox as Hannibal Lector (spelled Lecktor in this film, for some reason).""Manhunter"" could have been a pretty good had they kept in the real meat of the book - the background of Francis Dolarhyde and his struggle with the Red Dragon. Over a quarter of the book was about Dolarhyde's childhood and a good third was about the struggle with the Dragon. Truly one of the most incredible scenes in the book is when Dolarhyde faces down and devours (literally) the Dragon. All these scenes make the character seem really alive and something more human than it appears. So, what does the movie do with these scenes? TOTALLY discards them! The film leaves us with an unimpressive 2-D cardboard cutout of Dolarhyde, which was perhaps what dampers the film most for fans of ""Red Dragon"".The film may enjoy some cult flavor, and is a decent addition to the Lector trilogy. At best it would be wise to rent this flick before buying it. You may regret purchasing it if you read the book first.I'll leave you with some book-to-movie differences (AKA Minor Qualms):Too many scenes with Graham and his wife attempt to milk empathy from the film. 'Suppose it's the director's way to atone for cutting out all of the phone conversations. - Missing Francis Dolarhyde background - Dolarhyde's house is a one level, instead of a two level (now I'm just being picky.) - Love interest with Reba is cut down from the book's eight scenes to just two (combing six into one). - Dolarhyde's schizophrenic Dragon personality isn't even included in the movie. Therefore there is no showdown with the Dragon. - Movie's ending is completely FUBAR - completely clichéd and unworthy of even being considering an interesting ending. The book's plot twist ending is thrown into a paper shredder and comes out as your average ""good guy shows up at the last moment to save the girl"" type.FILM SCORE: 6/10",Manhunter

345,needanycarp,Had the potential to be much better,6,22 June 2003,"While I have not seen ""Hannibal"" or ""Red Dragon,"" I have seen ""Silence,"" and I think I can make a good comparison just between those two. ""Manhunter"" is by far the weaker movie, in a variety of ways. First off, the protagonist, Graham, is not as complex as Starling. While he supposedly habitually goes too deep into the mindset of a psychopath, at no point did he seem anything other than an apt cop to me, whereas Starling was a cop dealing with her outsider status as a woman, an orphan, and a farm girl, thus resulting in a multi-layered and more believable character. Secondly, the main villain is not as well-defined. The Tooth Fairy has seemingly no past and no well-defined psychosis and is played by Tom Noonan as what might be creepy if we knew what he was thinking behind his ominous silences. In contrast, Ted Levine's Buffalo Bill is truly loathsome, with a well-defined psychosis centering on sexual change and a performance that is convincingly chilling. Finally, the relationship between Graham and Lecter is not very well-defined, as compared to that of Starling and Lecter. I do not demand that Lecter appear more, although Brian Cox's portrayal could have proven better than that of Hopkins if we knew anything about the good doctor, yet those unfamiliar with the character will have no idea why Graham is so afraid of him. My complaint is that Graham's main character trait seems to be his being haunted by his past with Lecter, and yet that past is never clearly defined. The haunting thoughts of the psychosis are never really dramatized, and Lecter's cannibalism is never revealed at any point.
However, there are some things to recommend this movie. Petersen, Farina, and especially Cox give great performances, but they are trapped in a film that fails to appropriately flesh out their conflicts.",Manhunter
346,wareman,"Almost as good as ""Silence of the Lambs""",10,8 October 2002,"The only reason I would rate ManHunter second to Silence of the Lambs is because of Anthony Hopkins' outstanding performance as Hannibal Lecter. ManHunter (1986) preceded Silence of the Lambs (1991) by 5 years. I just saw ""Red Dragon"" which was a total rip off of ManHunter. If I had never seen ManHunter then I would rate Red Dragon higher than I do. I like Edward Norton as an actor, but preferred William Peterson's role as FBI Agent Will Graham. Brian Cox's role as Hannibal Lecter was adequate, but did not have the depth of persona that Hopkins' did (particularly in ""Silence""). Hopkins does a good job of recreating Hannibal in Red Dragon. Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of Francis Dolarhyde is very good, but elicits absolutely no sympathy as did Tom Noonan's fine portrayal of Dolarhyde in Manhunter. Again, if there would have been more originality in Red Dragon, I would have liked in more. It seems that Red Dragon tries to draw its appeal from a cast of high profile actors and actresses. Manhunter was just plain good film making that cast the characters well. Hats off to Michael Mann's directing. I do recommend Red Dragon. It is worth seeing. I highly recommend ManHunter, however.",Manhunter
347,Jusgure,Basically the most underrated thriller of all time.,8,21 June 2005,"Besides the fact that it was released without much hoopla in 1986, and that it was recently remade(the same exact movie except for the end) as Red Dragon, Manhunter is undoubtedly the most overlooked movie of the past 20 years. The plot is tremendous, Mann's direction is outstanding, and the acting(especially Noonan) is equally amazing. What Mann realized while making this film is that a thriller was not just meant to shock and disgust the audience but to develop the characters carefully so that there is an even greater sense of anticipation for the climax of the movie than there otherwise would be. Recent thrillers are clearly lacking in the character development that made movies like Manhunter and Silence of the Lambs so good. Its a shame that Red Dragon had to be made, since it is basically a strait ripoff of Manhunter except for a different ending which is much worse than the original and way too predictable. Anyone who thinks Red Dragon was a good movie should watch Manhunter and compare the two. If you try this you'll see that there is no comparison. Tom Noonan's performance alone is worth the watch.",Manhunter

There was a lot going for the movie at the start, especially the short meeting between Graham (Petersen) and Lecktor (Cox).

352,eddresden,what a film! underrated and slept-on. How thrillers should be made.,10,8 March 2005,"Micheal Mann's 1986 film 'Manhunter' is a truly majestic film. the first film to feature the now infamous Hannibal Lecter, it focuses on FBI manhunter Will Graham (Petersen) as he tries to catch the killer Francis Dollarhyde aka the 'tooth fairy' (Noonan). I won't describe the story and its ins and outs but what i would like to comment on are some of the aspects of the picture that make it my favourite film. The score is simply amazing. The use of the powerful 'Graham's theme' is simply perfect and carries forth the emotional intensity of the scenes in a great way. The song at the end of the film is perfect and leaves you feeling exhilarated,drained, emotional and liberated. The direction on Mann combined with the cinematography of Dante Spinotti is wonderful. The use of colour to portray mood and feeling in the film is second to none. The acting of Peterson in the role of Will Graham is brilliant. He is not over the top but shows the feelings of a troubled man in a very demanding job perfectly. Brian Cox, a brilliant stage actor anyway, is so chilling as Lecktor (how they spell it) it is unreal. His brooding menace eclipses the camp Lecter portrayed by Hopkins in later films. Manhunter is one of those films that is truly underrated and slept-on. It can be viewed over and over again and its style is incredible on each repeat viewing. I must recommend this film to all people who claim to love film and particularly Mann, director of such masterpieces as Heat and Thief. WATCH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Manhunter
353,buckdharwin,"Great, atmospheric, and flawed",9,27 January 2009,"I tend to agree wholeheartedly with most of the first few pages of comments on the motion picture. The movie is very successful in its clinical, analytical approach to psychopathy and to investigation. I daresay that this picture--along with Petersen's cerebral portrayal of Will Graham--is the single biggest influence on the genre of television shows now known to the masses as ""the procedural"". One might say that Gil Grissom's teeth were cut here. And I honestly have a difficult time determining whether Cox' or Hopkins' Lecter is the creepier. Cox' frank, almost chummy portrayal is definitely the more deceptive of the two.I love it on its own merits, and would be proud to keep it on my shelf alongside the later Lecter pieces, but for a few cinematic errors. Without revealing any events in the movie, I can point out that the editing is simply crappy at times, particularly just before the climax. There is also one major gaffe involving a visible boom mic, which I've allowed myself to live with, but which I cannot avoid pointing out to others each time I see it aired.I haven't yet seen Red Dragon, but can say that although I really do love the original, I wasn't upset to hear that it was being redone.",Manhunter

This is quite simply, one of the best films of all time. Tom Noonan is amazing and absolutely masterful in his portrayal of Dollarhyde, and even comes across as sensual, when he is obviously deriving sexual satisfaction watching Reba fondle the sleeping tiger. One of the sexiest scenes ever, by the way. This is what I think people who don't ""get"" this film are missing, the little nuances, such as his look of sexual ecstasy watching Reba with the tiger, you can see he is imagining himself in the tigers position, being the recipient of loving caresses. And his awkwardness when Reba finally makes love to him, its all these things that you actually have to engage your brain to understand, thats where people just don't understand this film. The music is incredible, especially Shriekbacks ""This Big Hush"", where Dollarhyde is in bed with Reba, is just inspired. William Petersen was born to play Will Graham, the tormented retired forensic cop, brought out of retirement by the Tooth Fairy's slayings of whole families. Brian Cox's portrayal of LECKTOR is superb, playing the ""straight man"" to Hopkins ""over the top"" campness. I cant understand why Cox didn't play the proper Lecktor role in the subsequent films. But thats what people don't get-its not about Lecktor. Its not about Red Dragon. It is BASED on the novel Red Dragon, which is why it doesn't follow the book ad verbatim.

""Red Dragon"", a book by Thomas Harris, extraordinary thriller because of it's great characters, especially leading three, two serial-killer's and ex-cop who caught one of them and is in the hunt for the other. Such a plot is nothing new in literature and movies but what makes this book/movie so innovative is two subplots which take this story to a new level. 1.subplot - serial-killer mastermind, Dr.Hannibal Lecter in his first appearance, who makes us stop thinking of serial-killers as mad and wild persons just waiting to get caught. His intelligence is frightening, and his knowing of peoples weaknesses is just chilling. He gives a new meaning to a cop that is good enough to catch him. 2.subplot - serial-killer who butcher's complete families, falls in love with a nice blind girl, making us start to feel sorry for him, almost wishing that his romance succeeds. In this part of the movie cop seems more wild then him. Both of these subplots are enough to make a good movie('Silence of the lambs' is based on first subplot) but here they are just one of diversions that give new meaning to our characters.

I watched Red Dragon straight after, which made comparison even more interesting.Although Hopkins is undisputed Hannibal Lecter and Lambs still keeps the title of the best Hannibal movie, Manhunter comes very close and manages to stay on top of Ridley's Hannibal and latest Red Dragon. Later being the worst in the series, but still watchable, thanks to always amazing performance from Hopkins.Mann shows great talent and sense for directing (we see a lot of his trade mark close-up shots we got used to in his later movies - Heat, Insider and Ali) along with good feeling of adapting the script (for example his later script adaptation of Last of the Mohicans). William L. Petersen is excellent in the role of FBI agent, which in some ways reminds me on his role of the head of C.S.I. TV series. I haven't read the book so I'm judging from what I've read, that Red Dragon follows the book more closely than Manhunter and in general Red Dragon makes things clearer for the audience. On the other hand Manhunter keeps the tension and has better character development. Especially the main role of agent Graham and relationship with his wife, which in Red Dragon is significantly less developed.In Manhunter Hannibal has important, but not as emphasized role as in Red Dragon for obvious reasons. The focus is on agent Graham and his struggle with himself and the killer, whose motivations are never as clear as in Red Dragon. In fact, Red Dragon itself is mentioned only once in the movie. I guess Mann though digging deeper into Red Dragon mythology would turn off the focus from the agent Graham.The title itself - Manhunter - indicates focus of the story, much like Red Dragon title indicates greater importance of the killer's motives in the remake and obviously in the book itself.Manhunter is excellent detective story with great psychological tension, tight plot and memorable performance, especially from the main character.",Manhunter

Tom Noonan brings a depth to Dollarhyde that is disturbing and surprising. Stephen Lang makes Freddy Lounds seem even more evil than Dollarhyde. And Brian Cox is chilling in his portrayal of Lector.I could go on and on. Just watch it for yourself--but don't watch it alone.",Manhunter
363,wtg3,One of the worst pieces of garbage i've ever seen,1,1 September 2001,"This is without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen. William Petersen's performance is horrible unconvincing; the dialog is laughable; and Brian Cox as Hannibal Lecktor seems neither threatening nor particularly intelligent. Michael Mann's decision to put pop music in the background was bad; not only are all the songs irritating, they make the movie seem dated and aren't particularly appropriate to the scenes they accompany. Without revealing too much, the clue that the hero uses to figure out the killer's identity is blatantly obvious. None of the movie is that realistic, but that's mostly standard Hollywood stuff (the villain manages to still stand and be menacing after being shot 5 times in the chest; the hero gets slashed on the face, yet the cuts don't bleed more than a few drops and miraculously he isn't hit in the eyes; the hero decides to throw all caution to the wind and not wait for back-up, and decides to go after the killer alone armed only with a revolver instead of waiting for the SWAT team; things like that) Over all people should just try and forget that this movie existds and just watch ""Silence of the Lambs"" instead",Manhunter
364,CylonRed,Horrible - just horrible....,1,1 April 2006,"Good god - what a HORRIBLE movie and adaptation. I never really liked Miami Vice and I think I now know why. He somehow removed ALL emotion and feeling from the book and actors. Since he never went into the characters back ground, you care NOTHING about them, what happens to them, nor do you understand why the murders are even happening.This should have been such a better movie. All through the movie I kept thinking how I could have made the screenplay so much better...I rarely get worked up about a adaptation but man - when you read the book and think what a cool movie it could be then get the tripe Michael Mann produced....

Mann's direction is not over done and captures the essence of the spectacular Thomas Harris novel as well as can possibly be done in anything short of a mini-series. Harris' books have that kind of depth and are impossible to really replicate in a 2 hour screen play. But Mann brings out truly stellar performances from Tom Noonan (as an occasionally sympathetic serial killer Francis Dolarhyde), William Petersen (as a very troubled yet very competent FBI agent) and Brian Cox (who does a terrific job as Hannibal Lecktor  he milks ever second of his minimum screen time - about 11 minutes max). Not to take anything away from the gifted Anthony Hopkins, but this is a far different, yet more believable Hannibal than we see in later screen versions of Harris' stories ..and just as frightening.The music is heavy in parts but well done and totally in keeping with the story.This version is far truer to the original novel and most folks who watch this and can put aside it's dated and far more limited budget than the later revision of 'Red Dragon' will appreciate it as the better version.If you haven't seen it, this is 2 hours of thrills and chills with totally believable characters.

I'm really curious why so many people gave this a movie a high grade. Some of my thoughts on this movie:1) First of all, it may be from the 80's but damn, that synth music is really really horrible. It doesn't add to the atmosphere and gives the entire music score a cheap B-movie feeling.2) The acting wasn't great nor convincing, it lacks feeling and mr. Badguy in this movie only looks scary because he's really ugly!3) Lame plot, I mean, If I wanted to see a movie with a serial killer, I don't want to find out he's one jealous mofo.4) Ridiculous ending! 5) All in all this movie didn'tgave me any scary feelings or moved me in some way. Silence of the lambs was so much better and scarier! Hopkins as Lecter does a 10000% better job at being scary and the right dude, this guy was just some semi-intellectual bum in a white cell.

372,drewjohnson61,Brian Cox is Hannibal Lecktor,10,29 October 2006,"Manhunter has been on my long time favorite movies list since I saw it in theatrical release. I agree that I like Brian Cox's performance as Lecktor more than Anthony Hopkins'. In fact, the art direction of Manhunter is much better than that in Silence of the Lambs. One might only take exception to the differences in the climax of Manhunter versus the book Red Dragon, but the dialog between Lecktor and Graham is nearly word-for-word out of the book, and that's fine by me. As with John Huston's adaption of The Maltese Falcon to film, if you have great dialog as the source material, why change it? I like the portrayal of the FBI better than the remake Red Dragon (which has Will Graham hopelessly miscast with Edward Norton). The music, the cinematography, and the costuming scream Miami Vice, but with Michael Mann at the helm that's to be expected. The scene when Graham realizes how the killer is selecting victims is a stirring moment... you can discern the realization on William Peterson's face. This is a great film!",Manhunter
373,gearylj,(Too) Great Expectations,7,5 August 2001,"I realize how cliche it is to say that a movie did not live up to the book. Maybe it was Michael Mann's intention to, as one other commenter said, ""make it his own"". However, the hype for Manhunter says ""Based on Thomas Harris' book THE RED DRAGON"". The only similarities to the book I found were the character names and a very loose and incomplete version of the story line. The claim that it ""takes you inside the mind of the killer"" is exactly what this movie lacked yet was so masterfully done in the Red Dragon book. I first saw Manhunter when it was first released to video, about '87. I saw it in the video store and couldn't wait to get it home. I had read Red Dragon a few years earlier and remembered thinking what a fantastic movie it would make. Now, here it was in my hot little hands! I was pumped! I began watching with eager anticipation and slowly sank into the deepest disappointment of my movie watching history. Everything that had made the book so enthralling was left out. Even the ending was changed! Had I expected too much? Probably. That's why, when I saw it recently in a bargain bin for $4.00, I bought it. Just to see if I had judged it too harshly the first time. Being several years removed from the book experience, and judging the movie strictly on it's own merits, I can understand why those who haven't read Red Dragon would think this movie is ok. I no longer HATE it, still, it's a disappointment. For those who only saw Manhunter, and have not read Red Dragon, do so. You WILL be glad you did. It will give you a far deeper understanding of this fantastic story and a greater appreciation for movies of this genre. As for Manhunter, oh well.",Manhunter
374,gavinfitz-04560,Incredibly underwhelming,4,27 July 2021,"I'm a huge fan of Michael Mann so I was disappointed by this underwhelming thriller. The lead actor, William Peterson, was the main reason. His performance was so poor that I never felt any real emotional connection to the character or the plot. He was wooden throughout most of the movie and I cringed at the scenes where he talked out loud to the killer. The movie was also marred by a bad score and some cheesy lines/scenes. Also, I never felt the any particular tension during the film, which is damnable for a thriller.Brian Cox is very good as Hannibal Lector but his portrayal isn't even in the same ballpark as Hopkins' (this isn't so much a knock on Cox as a reflection of just how good Hopkins was, who gave one of the best performances in movie history).",Manhunter
375,CTCkid,Must see!!!,10,21 December 2001,"One of my all time favorites, this movie keeps you going from start to finish.  While the ending was drastically changed from the book and hence not nearly as fulfilling, the action and cast keep this thriller moving anyway.  Bill Petersen is very good as a reluctant and almost burned out investigator assigned to some particularly vicious murders.  Even better, Tom Noonan's performance as the creepy Francis Dollarhyde was first rate and two small but very chilling scenes with Brian Cox as the original Dr. Lector make Anthony Hopkins look more like Mary Poppins.  If you find this anywhere buy it, you will not be disappointed.",Manhunter
376,smartarse-1,"Disappointing, but not awful",2,8 July 2007,"Having heard great things about this film, and being a big fan of Thomas Harris, this title promised much more than it delivered.The film has an overly 1980s feel to it - too much seems to be played on the fashions of the period, both musically and in terms of the acting. In parts, it resembles a generic US cop show more than an innovative piece of film making. The soundtrack is deeply unsuited to the atmosphere, with bizarre bouts of synth-pop cropping up and ruining some of the better moments.William Peterson plays a fair Will Graham, though his performance is blighted by the '80s show hero' role his character is presented as. Dennis Farina is forgettable as Jack Crawford and Stephen Lang's representation of Freddy Lounds as a shrieking, gullible car salesman stereotype is painful to watch, given the more calculating Lounds you'd imagine. Tom Noonan is a twitchy, nervous, wholly unsuitable Francis Dolarhyde, lacking the menace I had expected and looking for all the world like a favourite grandparent.Brian Cox's Hannibal Lecter is one of the few convincing displays, rescuing small portions of the film and making them watchable.Throughout the film, the dialogue is rushed and the storyline jumps from drawn-out to jumped-through. The scene in which Dolarhyde meets Reba was absurd - it seemed as though he had a sleeping tiger on a retainer at the zoo. The capture of Lounds does nothing to add to the suspense, with Noonan rushing through his lines without menace and failing to capture the atmosphere you would imagine the 'Great Red Dragon' might convey whilst in character. He seems to aspire to be Blake's painting rather than the Red Dragon itself.I struggled to watch this one through to the end. It departs enormously from the original, exciting storyline and becomes a weak, fragile and unconvincing waste of time.",Manhunter
377,catherine_b86,Not a thriller movie,4,11 October 2012,"Sad to say that i am deeply disappointed by the other reviews for this film. I wouldn't want to focus on characters but besides Lecter, none of the other characters persuaded me, especially the cop. The feeling the movie left me after 2 hours watching: boring - non thriller movie. I haven't read the book and i had no previous knowledge about it, i just wanted to see a movie that would make me feel the suspense.I felt no anxiety,at all,I kept myself from falling asleep. Probably this movie refers to previous generations, as i'm only 26 (but have watched dozens of mystery/thriller movies from 90's and 00's.)

378,mydnight,The Best of The Lector Films and Does Not need A Remake,10,19 August 2002,"Manhunter is simply one of the best thrillers ever made. One of the big complaints seem to be that it is too 80's and that is a silly reason not to look at the whole picture. From the first rate direction and script by Michael Mann, the beautiful photography by Dante Spinotti and the wonderful performances by William Petersen as Will Graham, Brian Cox as Lector, Tom Noonan as Dollarhyde, Joan Allen as Reba, Dennis Farina as Jack Crawford and Steven Lang as Lounds. They bring real depth and dimension to their characters that helps set this film apart from other thrillers. The film does not revel in gore but instead takes the viewer on a psychological trip not to be forgotten. Another big complaint is the ending and that it was changed from the book. It was changed and for the better, the ending of the book was not very good and almost ruined a great novel. Anyone who has not seen this great film should and yes the 80's soundtrack is dated but so what just because a film is a few years old does not mean it's bad I think there are quite a few classic film fans who would argue that and people who think that are missing out on a lot of great films including this one.

I had just seen Red Dragon, and was interested in seeing this earlier version of the story.  Boy was I glad, though Red Dragon had Anthony Hopkins, this one is the better of the two.  Michael Mann is a solid director and when he does projects, such as Ali, Heat,and Last of the Mohicans, you can be sure that they are worth your money, and this one is no exception.  It plays like an episode of Miami Vice, no wonder considering thats another one of Mann's works.  FBI Agent Will Graham tracks a deadly serial killer known as the Tooth Fairy, who believes that he is becoming ""The Red Dragon.""  Graham uses an interesting method to track down his man, he thinks like a killer, using evidence and the help of a one Hannibal Lector, he goes through the killers actions, describing what he was thinking.  Iron Butterfly's classic Hard Rock Anthem ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" has never sounded so chilling or worked so well as in the final moments of this film.

The movie guides you into and thru another world that is both comprehensive and convincing.I remember reading the book after seeing Silence of the Lambs and it was a great story - what I would expect from this author, but I had no idea that there had been a movie made. This is obviously a small budget film but that does make it all the more appealing to me.

383,kev121967,Francis Dollarhyde,9,30 December 2009,"Francis Dollarhyde sits in a van across from his lover's house observing her as she kisses another man. The man is young and slick, the antithesis of the middle-aged Dollarhyde, who suffers from a facial deformity. Only the woman does not know any of this; she is blind. And while Dollarhyde enjoys her affection (an affection that may or may not be facilitated by her inability to see his imperfect face) he is overwhelmed with anger and despair. You see, Francis Dollarhyde is a serial killer; he murders families then arranges their bodies as an audience for a ritual of ""transformation"" he conducts with the family's mother. The objective of his crusade is to become, as the great red dragon, a mighty beast awed and adored by all.The concept of serial murder as a device for psychosexual edification stems from the original American ghoul, Ed Gein, a Wisconsin farmer who experimented with female corpses in an effort to create a dress made of human skin. Gein's psychology was extrapolated from mid-western folklore by Thomas Harris and utilized in his second novel, Red Dragon. In Michael Mann's 1986 film adaptation, Manhunter, the principal antagonist is portrayed with equal parts dread and sympathy. Note how Francis Dollarhyde (Tom Noonan) is first introduced: he has kidnapped tabloid reporter Freddy Lounds and threatens to ""staple his eyelids to his forehead"" if he fails to open them. There is no overt violence in the scene. His aggression is communicated via the respected genre convention of perceived violence. At this point in the film, our paradigm for his behavior is the murder scene photos we've observed earlier. Therefore, when he threatens a brutal, sadistic act, the audience creates a harsher mental image than the director could have provided. This serves to fortify the character's menacing qualities while preventing us from developing a sense of disgust towards him. Thus, we may later feel sympathy when his psychology is explored. Hence, Manhunter is just as much about Dollarhyde's journey as Will Graham's.",Manhunter
384,servilan42,Michael Mann should stick to television!,1,15 March 2003,"Not much good can be said about this film.  I realize the actors did the best they could given the direction and the script.As usual, Michael Mann goes for style over substance.  Manhunter is nothing more than an extended version of Miami Vice.  While Miami Vice was okay for what it was; this movie is just pretension.It is a pretender to the throne of Red Dragon and SOTL.  A pretender ten times removed!!!The characters are sketchy at best and not well developed.  For instance, it was never really clear what Francis Dollarhyde was ""becoming"" or why. Yes, there was a reference to Blake's Red Dragon, but it was just in passing, casual conversation.  Either that or I missed it while yawning.Tom Noonan did the best he could with Dollarhyde.  He was kinda creepy but not nearly creepy enough!!  The lack of character development here is where the story takes a nose dive.  We don't have any idea what he's about.  We just know he wears panty hose on his head as a disguise.
Brian Cox's perfomance as Hannibal Lecktor (misspelled, by the way) was laughable!!  He was stilted, mechanical and obviously over rehearsed. There was nothing frightening about the character.  Lecktor is supposed to make your skin crawl just looking at him.  Not so here.  I continue to be dumbfounded that this character was so badly done.All I can say is, ""Michael Mann, stick to television.

385,spirit_cove,Life-changingly good,10,12 May 2003,"Like many film buffs from around the world, I've probably seen thousands of movies in my time. Without question, Manhunter is the finest, most dazzling, shocking, intense and atmospheric of any of them. I think there are four factors that make it the movie it is. The first is the novel, ""Red Dragon"" by Thomas Harris, that is based upon. His finest novel to date, it sets the characters and landscape for the movie. Secondly, the direction. Michael Mann (fresh from his success with 'Miami Vice') uses strong primary colours to set an ever-darkening tone around the various locations. Manhunter begins during the day on a bright, Florida beach and ends in the dead of night in a building in the middle of nowhere.Thirdly, is the acting. First-class. William Peterson is incredible. He doesn't just act Will Graham, he LIVES him. Tom Noonan (as Francis Dollarhyde) portrays one of the darkest, most terrifying characters I have ever seen. Joan Allen and the rest of the cast are wonderful. Finally, I think that this movie's music is one of its defining factors. Although now deleted, its soundtrack is something magical (even if slightly 80's and dated) that sets a wonderful, intense atmosphere thoughout the movie. Red Dragon (the remake of Manhunter) is awful. It was made purely to make money and well done, all involved, it has. Ted Tally may claim that the remake is the truest adaptation of the Thomas Harris novel, but it has nothing of the magic, inspiration and genius of Manhunter.",Manhunter

It's worth noting that the Lecktor of Manhunter is a different Lecktor (even just in script terms) to the Lector of 'Silence of the Lambs', a much more evidently evil, insane figure. Hopkins's Lector is a cartoon figure - very powerful for that, but not someone you'd ever meet - but Cox's Lecktor is the man sitting next to you on the bus, both evil and real.So many great scenes.

If you haven't already fallen for that crap and watched the movie, then hopefully I can convince you to keep it that way. Manhunter is far, far less exciting than Silence. In fact, I think it would be fair to say that Manhunter is less exciting than the latest Pokemon movie.Problem number 1 is their portrayal of Hannibal Lechter. As played by Anthony Hopkins, Lechter is one of the coolest movie villains ever, a chilling, frightening, and yet highly charismatic criminal. As portrayed by Brian Cox, he is a dull genius in a white cage. It wouldn't be entirely accurate to say he has no personality, but the one he does have (in the rare moments when he gets to show it) is far from captivating. Yes, there is just enough conniving to keep the plot moving, but there's hardly any motivation for it. Lechter's relationship to Will Graham is explained in no more than a sentence, thus removing all the dramatic impact of their on-screen interactions. Basically, everything that makes Hannibal Lechter an interesting character is absent in this film.There are other problems with the movie as well. I don't remember all of them at this point, but one that sticks out in my mind is a murder scene where the camera, watching only the two characters' feet as one of them lifted the other off the ground, was tilted to such a degree as to make the action extremely confusing. This sort of failed use of potentially interesting cinematic techniques is sadly par for the course in Manhunter.So basically, my point is do not waste your time on this movie. It adds nothing to the story presented in Red Dragon (or the other parts of the trilogy), and it lacks quite a lot.",Manhunter

The Tooth Fairy falls well into place as one of the all time evil villains. William Petersen...superb! I loved him in To Live and Die in LA...and nightly on CSI.

Graham is driven by his own dark memories and in his obsession of catching the killer he seeks help from sentenced serial-killer Hannibal Lector, Graham's ghost from the past, and even jeopardizes his family. The story is Based on the novel Red Dragon by Thomas Harris.The cast is outstanding and especially William Petersen's portrayal of Will Graham is excellent and makes you wonder why Petersen wasn't on Hollywood's A-list. A lot is said and written about the character of Hannibal Lecktor and the differences between the portrayals of Brian Cox and Sir Anthony Hopkins, but Cox's portrayal should be regarded on its own without keeping Hopkins in mind. It's a small but important part in the movie and Cox does an excellent job. Tom Noonan is chilling as Francis Dollarhyde and also the rest of the cast give good performances , especially Dennis Farina.Although it's a race against the clock for Graham, the movie itself moves at a slow paste but never drags along. Each scene is a visual treat with a stylish use of colors and art-deco surroundings, backed by a superb soundtrack. The best example of this is the scene where Dollarhyde and his date, a blind woman played by Joan Allen, are with a veterinary surgeon and a dazed tiger. The tiger symbolizes Dollarhyde, the sleeping predator, and in the background a suspenseful track by Shriekback. Michael Mann, in his first collaboration with cinematographer Dante Spinotti, has made an exciting, gripping and stylish thriller, which stands out in this genre. In part it has the looks of Miami Vice, but in contrast to the TV show produced by Mann, Manhunter withstood the test of time, making it one of Mann's best movies.",Manhunter

Here it is used to set a brooding, haunted, troubling tone, which is very appropriate to the Will Graham character, played wonderfully by ""CSI"" lead William Peterson.Graham is an FBI profiler who gets a serial killer's mentality into his head, which uniquely enables him to zero in on a killer better than other profilers. This ability to adopt the feelings of someone so evil is emotionally very hard on Graham, a moral, dedicated family man.Back story is that Graham was severely wounded and almost killed by being stabbed by Hanibal Lecktor. This, combined with the emotional struggle of his profiler role, lead to Graham's brooding, yet thorough and conscientious character. This is played much better in ""Manhunter"" than in ""Red Dragon.""Brian Cox plays Hanibal Lecktor. Lecktor is important in this version, but not as important or dominant as in ""Red Dragon"" where he is played by Anthony Hopkins. The antagonist is one Francis Dollarhyde, the serial killer. He has murdered every member of two families. The modus operandi of both murders makes it clear the killer is the same in both cases, but the connection between the victims is a mystery. Why and how did he select these two families, one in Atlanta and one in Birmingham? It appears he is on a lunar cycle, so there are a scant three weeks until he murders again. Graham has retired owing to the emotional trauma of past cases and nearly being killed by Lecktor, but his old boss, played wonderfully by Dennis Farina, drags him back into ""just this once"" case. Graham's wife is furious with the Farina character for doing so. Graham's wife, Molly, is played well by Kim Griest.The deal is that Graham will just do what he can to identify the killer and the FBI will take it from there. No Graham/killer contact.Well, you just know it won't work out that way.",Manhunter
392,kdnok,Great movie in '86! Great movie now!,10,24 October 2004,"My roommate and I thought the movie was great when we first saw it back in 1986. We were in college then. I still think it's a terrific movie! The movie was definitely full of suspense, and it had us sitting on the edge of our seats.When I heard the name Hannibal Lector mentioned in the movie ""Silence of the Lambs"", I remembered it from ""Manhunter"". Since ""Manhunter"" occurred before ""Silence ..."", I was surprised that FBI agent Will Graham's name wasn't mentioned. After all, William Peterson's character, Will Graham, was the person responsible for putting him in prison.William Peterson did a wonderful job, and I've been a fan of his ever since.My family watches CSI: every week.",Manhunter
393,jessi-57-617009,My first,9,16 July 2020,"This movie was my first foray into the mind of Dr. Hannibal Lector. I get it. They spelled it different. But, if memory serves, I watched this before Silence of the Lambs. I have always enjoyed William Petersen in this. It's not that I dislike Edward Norton in Red Dragon, just, you always remember your first.I've read the book and I still picture William P, not Edward N when I read it.Give it a chance. If you love the franchise, please, GIVE THIS ONE A CHANCE and know that it was first.",Manhunter
394,newmie537,Highly Overrated,1,18 January 2017,"It absolutely baffles me that so many people have rated this movie a 10/10. After watching both Red Dragon and Manhunter, I've never been so disappointed. The acting in this movie was sub par at best; it was impossible to watch at times. The characters were not well constructed at all and there honestly wasn't one character that truly felt like they fit this movie. Watch Red Dragon if you haven't already and you will never watch this movie again. There were no thrills to this movie, the final scene was one of the worst climaxes I've ever seen, though there wasn't really much build up to it so you could only be so disappointed. This movie does for Red Dragon what The Godfather part 3 does for the original godfather. Save your time and your money, do not watch this movie!",Manhunter
395,roryweatherly,Why Manhunter is Superior to Red Dragon,10,21 September 2015,"I saw the unedited, original version of Manhunter in 1986 and knew, right then and there, that I had seen a film that would forever live among my favorites. Sixteen years later, Director Brett Ratner set up camp (i.e. lights, cameras; security personal; two of Red Dragon's stars, Ralph Fiennes and Emily Watson) on the corner of my street as my toddler and I watched him re-make the one film in which nothing needed to change. Not even the score. Where others find the music to be overbearing, I found it haunting and suspenseful, and memorable, much like that heard in The Exorcist.The relatively unknown cast, was chosen with skill. Each major player turned in phenomenal performances. Simply put, it is my opinion that the remake fails epically by comparison. Without further ado, and not too many spoiler moments, I'd like to comment on the performances of both movies' stars and then encourage the reader to rent Manhunter and see for himself.William Petersen, as FBI profiler Will Graham, is intense, sometimes gritty and others, sublime. Ed Norton's Will Graham was too young, too one dimensional and not at all believable in this role. Dennis Farina, Graham's superior at the FBI, is convincing and works very well with Peterson. Harvey Keitel's Jack Crawford did not impress. Joan Allen's, Reba, is nothing short of stellar. If I hadn't known better, I would have, without a doubt, thought she was blind. When speaking, she artfully hides her actual vision by looking blank in the general direction but never focusing in. I remember thinking how hard that must be to do. Emily Watson's Reba was just pitiful. Her character appears weak, her expression is just blank and her performance, as a whole, was extremely sub-standard and disappointing. Serial killer, Francis Dollarhyde, aka ""The Tooth Fairy,"" played by Tom Noonan, delivers a spot on portrayal of a dissociative sociopath and includes the very rare experience of empathy and attachment later in the movie, At that moment, I believe the audience forgets he's a killer.. He looks so genuinely vulnerable and leaves you wondering if things would have gone differently for him at an earlier stage in his life. Ralph Fiennes, however, is not at all menacing in my opinion, doesn't appear to be wickedly clever. He bored me to tears. Lastly, the original Hannibal Lecktor, played by forerunner Brian Cox, is as good as it gets. You can cut the tension in the air whenever he is in a scene which is not often enough. His pathology is so deep; he's manipulative, calculatingly brilliant and quite menacing....something Ralph Fiennes just did not pull off. Cox brought this complex character to life and made it his own. That's where it remains his to this day.Manhunter is clearly the better film in every way. It has poignant moments around almost every corner. Reba's ""seeing"" an anesthetized tiger is just one of those. She allows the vet to place her hand by its mouth to feel its breath, convincing her it was alive. Then, with a fascination hard to describe, she drapes herself over this man-eater and uses senses other than sight to soak it all in. She is mesmerized by the intensity of the moment. We watch, transfixed, as she hears his heart beat and strokes the beasts' fur. Dollerhyde's voyeuristic reaction is shared by the audience here. You're left feeling jealous of her handicap as you know what she experiences in that moment is not attainable for those with sight.. It is a very moving, seductive scene.Good stuff, Michael Mann.",Manhunter
396,kayehenworth1,interesting,7,19 August 2005,"I remember picking up a book called 'Red Dragon' at random in a second-hand store and thinking it might be good one to take on holiday. It took me 7 hours to read it the first time and a bit longer the second (because I speed read the first time round. Sometimes I cheat and read the last 4 or 5 pages first). Each of the 3 subsequent readings took a bit longer as I found more details. A few years later, a film called 'Silence Of The Lambs' was released amid much hype, but it wasn't a film I was attracted to. Neither was the book ( I couldn't get past the Burke and Hare names without thinking of the famous English grave robbers). Then came 'Hannibal' with the same effect. However, there suddenly appeared a sequel (prequel) called 'Red Dragon' and I couldn't resist watching in case it was a film of the book I'd read. I was disappointed. Two nights ago, my Hubby recorded 'Manhunter' and said it was something to do with Hannibal Lecter. Mmmmm? The only one I had heard of was 'Red Dragon'. However, I watched it and, although it left quite a lot to be desired in the acting department, there was more I recognised in comparison to film/book in 'Manhunter' than in 'Red Dragon'. My only defence? My first experience of TV was programmes like 'The Professionals', 'Jason King' etc, etc, so I must admit I read 'Red Dragon' in a '70's setting'.",Manhunter
397,danny_jr_edwards,A true artistic classic.,10,9 June 2020,If you want a truly inspired representation of Thomas Harris Red dragon... look no further. This is THE movie. Awesome soundtrack. Fantastic visuals. Superb acting. I mean what more do you want?,Manhunter
398,neptunienne,I nearly died of... ... ... boredom,2,26 October 2005,"Where to start? When you watch a thriller, you expect a certain amount of suspense, mystery and action. Unfortunately, ""Manhunter"" has none of these.William Petersen as Will Graham literally carries the movie in the few inspired moments of monologues with his ""nemesis"". Brian Cox plays a fair Hannibal Lecter. None of the other actors or characters stand out and seem to be there as part of the furniture.Which brings me to the subject of the movie's photography. Weird angles used excessively and unimaginatively, gazillions of dreadful static camera shots, and extremely badly directed ""action"" scenes.I laughed, I cried, it was that terrible. The most frightening part of the movie was probably that it lasts two hours. I cannot understand what all the fuss is about. I've neither read the novel nor am a fan of ""Silence of the Lambs"", so this simply comes from someone who enjoys good, interesting thrillers (with a plot).",Manhunter
399,johnpellegrini,Not That Good,3,5 January 2006,"Sorry, but I was not overly excited or scared or even impressed with this movie. I saw it the year it came out, well before the Silence of the Lambs hype and I just didn't find it all that interesting. Perhaps because the movie was made by Michael Mann between seasons of Miami Vice, it just looks and feels like another episode of that show, albeit a long episode. The locations don't work for me the way the locations of Silence of the Lambs and the later version of Red Dragon did. That said, the casting is great with Brian Cox presenting a fantastic Hanibal Lector (I was surprised that he was passed over to be Hanibal in Silence of the Lambs). Also William Petersen makes a much more believable Will Graham than Edward Norton did who I thought was far too young to be Graham, and Dennis Farina brings a ""seen it all"" wearied look to Jack Crawford that Scott Glenn wasn't able to achieve. But I wasn't at all compelled by Tom Noonan's Francis Dollarhyde.However, the movie did make me seek out the book, which was far better.",Manhunter
