0,SnoopyStyle,"creepy story, but not very compelling",5,24 September 2013,"Poor university student Lucy (Emily Browning) responds to a mysterious ad and falls into an erotic creepy job.The pacing for this is way too slow. I'm willing to let the creepy story seep in, but I can't let the creeping pace go. There are too many nothing scenes. Julia Leigh is the writer/director of his artsy film with pretensions of greatness. As for the nudity, there is no sexiness or beauty. It's not gritty. It's not powerful. If we need anything, we need really tough acting from Emily Browning. She needs to show a range of emotions that she doesn't seem to possess. For most of this movie, she gives us her blank face. I must admit that there is something unique here. It's probably worked out exactly as Julia Leigh had wanted. But I just don't find it compelling.",Sleeping Beauty
1,Hitchcoc,Anything for a Buck?!!,4,25 May 2012,"Is there anything to this? I really am fairly astute when it comes to all kinds of film. This left me cold. I was left so cold by the basic sadistic nature of this film. This girl needed some money. She needed to get out of her situation. i give you that. But what she does and the people that provide the opportunities are so bizarre that I just couldn't imagine it. I know she was truly tough and resilient, but what she puts up with would destroy anyone. She is defiant to a fault. This could be a reason, I suppose. There was a fair amount of money offered. But it wasn't enough for her, unless she felt so desperate that there was no other way. They never really tell us that. Then there are the sick relationships outside the position she accepts. I'm sure someone might explain to me that there is artistry at work here. I don't get it.",Sleeping Beauty
2,claudio_carvalho,"Pointless, Boring, Pretentious and Unpleasant Garbage",1,6 September 2012,"The nihilist college girl Lucy (Emily Browning) has a dysfunctional family and lives together with her sister and brother-in-law. She is financially supported by three minor jobs: she is submitted to a weird experiment in a laboratory; she cleans a restaurant; and she takes photocopies in an office. She finds an advertisement in the newspaper offering a job in a fancy brothel and paying US$ 250.00 per hour. The madam Clara (Rachael Blake) hires her and she is assigned to serve drinks to wealthy clients on a dinner table wearing lingerie. Then Clara drugs her and she spends the night sleeping naked with impotent man that can do any kinkiness with her body but penetration. ""Sleeping Beauty"" is a pointless, boring, pretentious and unpleasant garbage. Everything is wrong in this movie: Emily Browning can be anything but a beauty; every character is unpleasant; there is no explanation, moral or whatever to explain the self-destructive behavior of Lucy. The film does not even shock the audience since it is not bold or bizarre enough in the sex scenes. I thought that she was doing all of that just for money but she inexplicably burns a one hundred-dollar bill. But maybe the worst is that this crap was written and directed by a woman. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): ""Beleza Adormecida"" (""Sleepy Beauty"")",Sleeping Beauty
3,grantss,Pretentious nonsense,1,18 June 2015,"Australian dramas mostly fall into two broad camps - great crime-dramas, e.g. Animal Kingdom and Snowtown, or pretentious crap, e.g. Jindabyne. Sleeping Beauty is one of the latter, and it takes pretentious crap to levels of pretense and craptacularity usually only the French can muster.No real point to the movie at all. Plot's initial idea is to shock the audience, and even that feels dull and drawn out, reminding me of Eyes Wide Shut. After that it just drifts around and goes nowhere.Performances are generally unconvincing and dull, in keeping with the plot. Emily Browning was miscast in the lead role (though every other actress out there should be thanking their lucky stars that they don't have this on their CV).Avoid at all costs. It will save you nearly two hours of your life.",Sleeping Beauty
4,Boba_Fett1138,It will more likely turn you into a sleeping beauty instead.,5,3 December 2011,"It's not like I'm not capable of appreciating a good artistic or original movie, on the contrary really but this movie is offering far too little to make it stand out on any level.Perhaps it's true that I'm simply getting fed up with these sort of movies, since I have seen far too many of them already. It's the sort of movie that's all too well aware of its style and realizes very well its being part of the more artistic, independent movie genre. It's therefore being just like any other movie out of the genre basically, without offering anything new or provoking.It has a very deliberate and well thought out and planned, style of film-making to it. It doesn't feel spontaneous in any way. The movie very rarely cuts away. When there is a cut in this movie, it means that the scene is over and another one, set at another place will start. The camera does move at times but lots of times the movie only consists purely out of static shots, with characters sitting or standing in the foreground. It's all too forced and obvious and if I want a front-view of actors, with a few props and sets, I'll go and watch a stage-play. The possibilities with movies are now days pretty much endless, yet the movie is doing absolutely nothing with it. It's minimalistic and slow, up to a point that the movie actually starts to become a bit of a drag. It manages to make 104 minutes seem like a very long time!So is the movie pretentious? It's deliberately trying to be an artistic one, with its images and storytelling but I wouldn't go as far as saying it's being a pretentious one, since this is director's Julia Leigh first movie and I do believe all of her intentions with it were very honest. Still she really needs to work on developing a style of her own, that really suits her and the stories she is trying to tell with her movies. There now still is nothing that makes her style unique from anything else, or distinctive in any way. It also wouldn't had harmed the movie if she got a more experienced screenplay writer to come in and help to write the story with her. I actually do feel and believe that the story worked well on paper but on the silver screen it really falls flat.It all really could had still worked out well if the movie indeed had an intriguing story or main character in it. But the movie tries to tell its story more so with its images, rather than featuring a real good main plot line or emotions in it. It does come across a bit as some lazy film-making; 'Don't worry about the script or actors, just place a camera in a room and let the emptiness and remoteness of the scene tell the whole story'. Sorry, I just really wasn't falling for that.It does make Emily Browning's role also a bit of an ungrateful one. Ever since she had been appearing in movies and series as a child, it was apparent that she would one day not only grow into becoming a beautiful woman but also a great star and actress. However after seeing her in this movie it also becomes apparent that she isn't quite ready for it to play a lead role and carry a movie almost entirely on her own. But all of the blame can't fall entirely on her in this case, since it probably was director Julia Leigh that told her to play her character as a very distant and emotionally bland one. Seriously, she is hardly ever showing any emotions on her face. You can't really tell if she is ever happy or sad and as a viewer it makes you feel very detached from her. This is also because she is doing some very unusual and unlikely things in this movie. It never becomes really apparent why she does them and why she is the way that she is. The movie is not really offering you an exploration into a young woman's mind and her journey in life, on her way of becoming a true woman. Just like many of its scene's, the movie feels mostly as a very empty and distant one.And what was with here wearing the same type of clothes throughout the entire movie? She is either wearing a skirt or a dress, with some high boots, or she is either half- or completely naked. Nothing wrong with showing some skin but Emily Browning's body looks like a 13-year old, even while she was 23 at the time. The clothes she was wearing really didn't seemed to suit her body type and it actually worked quite distracting for me. It made me want to send her some money, so she could buy some pants and normal shoes. Some people might still get something out of the movie its images or will read deeper into some of the movie its moments but personally I got very little out of this movie. It was a very empty movie story-wise and an emotionally bland one, that by the end left nothing more than a very redundant impression on me.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Sleeping Beauty
5,george.schmidt,Browning is a game actress in a brave turn in an otherwise awkward attempt at social mores and sensuality.,7,5 January 2012,"SLEEPING BEAUTY (2011) ** Odd and uneven drama about a young coed (Emily Browning, the film's saving grace in a brave turn) attempting to make ends meet – and a reason to exist – finds herself between odd jobs as a high-priced, super confidential lingerie waitress that leads to an elite clientele involving her sedated and literally being the eponymous object. Novice filmmaker Julia Leigh seems to have airlifted the bizarre sexual sequence from Stanley Kubrick's EYES WIDE SHUT and run with it to the best of her titillation abilities which are more awkward than sensuous. While it is decently paced and offers a glimpse of humor (i.e. Browning's ongoing temp job contentiousness with her icy co-worker/boss rings far too true for the drones!) the film as a whole seems to be missing an essential item: a reason to be told.",Sleeping Beauty
6,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Sleeping Beauty,5,6 April 2012,"With the re-imagination of fairy tales such as the take on Little Red Riding Hood and two upcoming snow white movies in Mirror Mirror and Snow White and the Huntsmen, filmmakers are digging deep into fairy tales for inspiration for their stories, giving them a little twist to the characters and scenarios, that sometimes court a little more controversy like in this case.At first glance, this film is likely to be mistaken for a fantasy adventure for elite club old men, who maintain a hush hush membership to a somewhat clandestine dining club where they are served by naked women, and then for those who want to, get to spend some alone time as well with the girls. The catch however is that these girls are given a tea to drink prior to the nights accompaniment, that sort of works like a date rape drug, but the pact that the old men have to promise to adhere to, is that there should be no penetration. But who's there to check anyway?Writer-director Julia Leigh in her debut feature puts us there like a fly on a wall, with that exclusive sneak peek into what goes on behind those bedroom doors, but alas like the pact the old men have to keep to, we don't get to see anything in exchange for some privacy, where the narrative fades to black as things get a little more risqué. And what we do get to see in having our voyeuristic tendencies fed, is plenty of Emily Browning in the titular role, being moved around, abused even, in her birthday suit, and one wonders if she's really fast asleep given the sick things these men have up their sleeves, and whether their promises of not sticking it in will be kept. All that we're getting is a tease, and suggestion, with little else on offer.Browning plays a poor university student desperate to make some money on the side, and we don't actually get to see whether she gets paid for spending the nights with random strangers picked up from bars. Her house-mates don't like her for not paying rent on time, and she spends half the time on campus looking for jobs, or sustaining her waitressing one during the nights, or volunteering for some health probes and screening just to earn a quick buck. Opportunity knocks in the form of a job under Clara (Rachael Blake), where discretion is key and expectations get set, and she's to maintain her nubile body and not abuse it with smoke, drink or drugs, which of course this girl of the night finds it hard to do without. Whatever free time also gets spent on a man (Ewen Leslie), with whom she seems to be sustaining a strange, domesticated relationship as well.We journey with her into her new job, and get to see various old men taking her to bed, treated like a piece of meat. Naturally throughout the course of making it good and getting paid handsomely for her efforts, curiosity will creep in and comes in the form of a spy camera, which she installs during one of the forays to capture and witness for herself how her body would get abused. This set up promises to shock during the end, but all we get is a whimper instead after all the expectations built into the narrative given its premature transitions (at least to audiences wanting more) to the next scene.Some may say that this may have touched upon the theme of empowerment of her sexuality, but I would prefer to go as far as saying this is like the Emperor's New Clothes. There isn't nearly anything much to see, and the narrative is pretty bland. We spend more time ogling at what's going on because it's so in-your-face and the desperation of the old men somewhat hilarious as well, though we're probably wishing we have membership to such an exclusive club, than to try and peer beneath the veneer of ostentatious clubs. One wonders what Browning sees in the role other than to announce her hastiness in wanting to arrive in the big leagues, thinking that going without clothes could probably fast track her career as the fearless actress willing to bear all for an arty role. She plays her character convincingly, although I'm not quite sure if Sleeping Beauty would give her the mileage she expected to receive.As a first film, it is daring, bold and provocative, but if you'd sit back and think about it, you're likely to feel, what's the point in this more style than substance film?",Sleeping Beauty
7,bowmanblue,One of those love it or hate it movies,6,2 May 2015,"Sleeping Beauty is a fanciful 'indie' movie about a girl, Sara, who has numerous mundane jobs as she attends an Australian university, but decides to take on some *ahem* nightwork as an inanimate object who sleeps alongside paying customers.It's one of those films that leaves me wishing that I was smarter. I figure that way I'd like movies like this more.Let's face it - it's different. It's different in the way it's shot, the way it tells it's story, the way the actors speak and are asked to perform and it's definitely not your average Hollywood output. It's an independent film which, if it's lucky, will achieve a cult following.The dialogue is slow (if there is any at all), there is even less background music, it is filmed largely with one static camera shot per scene (scenes which tend to go on for longer than you might expect) and the actors all behave very aloof.I have nothing against films that go against the 'classic Hollywood narrative.' The film industry needs them. And I'm no prude when it comes to tackling sensitive adult issues on film. However, sadly, I have to come down on the side of those who thought this film was just simply boring. I know it tries to be shocking and different. I just thought it was dull.It's basically one of those love/hate films. I've read plenty of other reviews on it and about half side with me, while the others praise its artistic merits and depth of film-making. That's fine. Just expect to either turn it off after twenty minutes or sit riveted to the end in admiration.Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm now off to watch Bruce Willis slapping bad guys and giant monsters trashing New York.",Sleeping Beauty
8,tomgillespie2002,Will resonate in your mind for some time,5,20 October 2011,"In a scene towards the climax of the film, we see Lucy (Emily  Browning), taking a lesson at university where the lecturer seems to be  analyzing a game of chess. The question is proposed, asking why would  someone make a move securing their defeat? This seems to be relevant  for Browning's character throughout this very interesting tale of  sexual depravity and the detachment of the female body to the masculine  libido. Lucy works her way through education, financing her way with  various menial jobs. She begins a job with an exclusive, and very  clandestine operation, beginning simply with silver service waitressing  in ""risque"" negligee. This of course progresses into a more dangerous  level, when she is offered a very well-paid gig involved a drugging so  that she may sleep whilst a client does what he wishes. Although, as  promised in Lucy's first interview, ""Your vagina will not be  penetrated"".  From first time director Julia Leigh, the film has various similarities  to Luis Bunuel's excellent Belle de Jour (1967), mainly in it's  depiction of a strong female character who wishes to delve into a  dangerous world of male desires. However, unlike Bunuel's film, Leigh  has created a character in Lucy, who seems utterly detached from the  people around her. She does visit Birdman (Ewne Leslie), who seems to  be agoraphobic, but this is not elaborated on. She seems also very  willing to do things without questioning. In one scene she is offered a  pill after her work in a restaurant, she asks what it is, but takes it  without having had an answer.  The film is self-consciously European in it's atmosphere and pace. The  handling of the subject matter is never gratuitous, neither does it  spoon feed a message of masochistic perversity. Browning is excellently  vacuous in the role, gently drifting from situation to situation with  not a question or any adversity. The film is beautiful to look at (and  I don't just mean the alabaster figure of the nude Browning), it's  pallet of autumnal colours adding extra references to 1970's European  cinema. There is no doubt that this film will divide viewers. Dirty old  men ogling over a sleeping, naked 22 year old, will make for  uncomfortable viewing for some, but I felt that this was not  exploitational in it's depiction. We also never really see what these  old men do in the time they are given with the ""sleeping beauty"". All  we get is an almost confessional from one of the customers. After being  advised by Clara (Rachel Blake) that there is no penetration, the  client states: ""The only way I can get a hard-on, is if I take 12  Viagra and get a beautiful lady to shove her fingers up my arse"".  The films conclusion is haunting, beautifully realised and ambiguous.  It certainly raises more questions than it answers about this detached  and seemingly passive female character in a world of strange male  desire. A film that will resonate in your mind some time after it has  finished.",Sleeping Beauty
9,Tweetienator,Real Gem or Real Crap - It Depends,8,12 October 2018,"Sleeping Beauty is one of those movies (or records, books etc.) that split most of the audience into two groups - you like it a lot or you don't like it at all. Imo, if the reception of a work of art is very controversy that just shows that the respective piece did something right and hit a nerve - to the good or to the bad.Sleeping Beauty gives us a glimpse (no matter if its accurate or not) into a world of riches and the price of and for beauty and of the diversity of sexual ""interestes"". Moralistic bores won't and cannot appreciate such a movie, because its about sexuality and not about ""romantic love"", but in times where many students (at least in Europe and even on a global scale) sell their bodies (many without bad conscience) for a lot of money to rich and not so rich men and women (escort services and such things) this kind of ""high-profile"" prostitution is reality. Work for some bucks per hour for Walmart or have some fun and earn a lot of money such women (and men) argue. In a very capitalistic and materialistic world this is for some people simply a matter of a cost-benefit calculation.Very beautiful almost poetic pictures, a fine cast and an interesting story make this one an fine dish for the connoisseur of the unusual. In the 60s and 70s Romy Schneider would have played in such a movie with a French director of course.A movie with a very European tone and a real gem between all those hollywoodized and stereotyped movies that spill our screens usually.",Sleeping Beauty
10,GOWBTW,A bold move for Emily Browning,6,20 December 2012,"Julia Leigh makes her debut in directing ""Sleeping Beauty"". This has more of an erotic twist than usual. Here you have a university student name Lucy(Emily Browning) , who holds some jobs: works at a coffee shop, makes photocopies at an office, even volunteers as a human lab rat(test subject). Then one day, she checks out a ad for freelance silver service: that's serving older men. The dinner is very formal, and the pay is well. There's one important rule: No penetrating sex. In the meantime, she would meet up with a very quiet man who is known as Birdmann (Ewen Leslie) she never seems to return the favors from him, but she's very content. Following the last session of her job, Birdmann calls her up, and he has overdosed. Lucy would cuddle up with him as he slowly expires. Following his death, Lucy would get a more expensive apartment, and also a secret camera so she would know what's going on while sedated. The next client she had was the first man who didn't cross the line. After the session, he has died from the tea he drank. Guess his heart wasn't strong enough to handle the dose. This movie had a very dark tone, and it was very morose in its way. Very enjoyable by the way.",Sleeping Beauty
11,billcr12,Pointless,3,3 March 2012,"Sara(Emily Browning is a waitress, a college student, an office worker, and, last but not least, an escort. She is also a guinea pig in some unexplained medical experiment in a lab where a long tube is dropped into a throat; a full schedule indeed. Sara drifts from scene to scene without any purpose whatsoever. While working as an escort, a series of rich, old, impotent men are the ""clients"" who are told that the one rule is "" no penetration."" During the encounters, Sara is sound asleep, her sleep being induced by a strong sedative to prevent her from awakening while do what they will with her semi-comatose body. I am shocked that a woman, Julia Leigh, could write such a misogynistic, dreary script filled with so many unsympathetic characters; what is the point? I guess we didn't already know that wealthy men past their prime desire young, nubile women, what a revelation. Avoid ""Sleeping Beauty"" at all costs; take a nap instead.",Sleeping Beauty
12,drownnnsoda,Silence speaking volumes,8,29 February 2012,"This isn't a movie for people who watch films just to be entertained, and anyone going into it with that expectation is going to hate it, and I don't blame them. On a technical scale, let's make things clear here: Emily Browning, with as vacant as she is required to be in this film, is a very good actress. So are all the supporting performers. The cinematography, while detached and static, is also professional and visually appealing. The dialogue, or what little there is of it, is realistic enough. The music; there isn't any.Now, I'm taking this largely from a message board post I made, but this is an analysis; read on if that's what you want. If you want something else, search through other reviews. Assuming you want an analysis, here it goes. Look at it like this: this film is a power play where everything leading up to the final moments means nothing and everything. The last scene where the tables turn and our protagonist Lucy takes emotional control over a situation is the only stroke of color we get to see in this entire movie. Everything else prior to the final scene is completely filler to her, and is, therefore, completely filler to us as an audience. In all reality, she is a protagonist devoid of character. She is a shell. That's why people don't like this movie; we can't really connect with her, and we aren't supposed to. Whether or not her nonchalant existence is a commentary on modern culture or not is up in the air, but the fact remains that, in the walls of this movie, she doesn't care about anything or anybody, really, so it's impossible to care about her.Let's look at it: in the film, we gather that Lucy's relationship with her mother is strained and means little to her; she doesn't have any sort of friendship with her roommates and seems to hardly acknowledge them, nor does she have any friends or acquaintances aside from Birdman; she disrespects her body by prostituting herself and experimenting with drugs; she risks her own health by selling her body to medical corporations as a lab rat for quick cash; she also works as an office temp. and at a restaurant, but doesn't seem to have any sense or regard for her jobs. And all of this for what? She attends college but doesn't seem to really know why she's there or care about what she's there for. Her jobs mean little more to her than a means to pay her rent and restlessly push herself through college which, as aforementioned, doesn't seem to hold any value to her. What is she even doing there? She goes through the motions but doesn't seem to know or care why; she's not awake to the world, nor does she see the circularity of her actions or the risks she's taking as being a threat to her. She doesn't even know why she's taking those risks in the first place. She's totally opaque as a person. She's absent; a caricature, really. It's not until the very last scene that she has a moment in her life that pushes her out of her cultural coma and into the actual present; the here and then. It's almost as if the film is nudging and prodding the audience with the question: ""Are you awake?"" and if not, ""What does it take?"". How long can you be a ""sleeping beauty""? Some people are ""sleeping beauties"" until the day the die; some people sleep through life. Others wake up. Sleep, while necessary to life, cannot dominate life physically, mentally, and emotionally. That is the point of this film as I saw it. Lucy is an example of someone pushed to extremes in order to wake up from her trance toward the universe. Unfortunately, the people who NEED to hear the statement this movie makes are the ones who are most likely to never hear it, and if they do, they are probably in too deep a sleep to fully comprehend it. The movie comes off like a wake-up call to critical thinking, but if that was Julia Leigh's intent, she's not going to get very far with it because people who don't think critically aren't going to be affected by it in the first place.Everyone involved in this movie took a massive risk in even making it, and, judging from the message boards here on IMDb as well as the critical response out there to it, most people either missed or DISMISSED what was being said in between the lines and used it to attack the movie rather than acknowledge what was being implied. In a sense, the fact that this movie even exists seems as pointless as the life that Lucy inhabits as a character. It's almost as if it were a cinematic oxymoron and never should have even been filmed. Maybe THAT was the whole point and Julia Leigh is just playing tricks on us for laughs, but I somehow doubt it. Regardless, you have to read between the lines here or this movie is totally useless, and I'm willing to admit that— and this is coming from someone who actually LIKED it. There's nothing really truly being said by this film, and yet, by the nature of its existence, there's a lot being said. That's why people can't stand it, because it's like one big whopping oxymoron, and oxymorons are frustrating. So, Ms. Leigh, congratulations on frustrating 95% of moviegoers. I appreciate the endeavor and artistry of the film, but I think your message is lost in translation, at least for now. Time will tell. David Lynch, however, would be proud.",Sleeping Beauty
13,RavenGlamDVDCollector,"Sleeping Beauty, did somebody doze off?",7,14 November 2016,"Actually, a 7 minus. Because of missing out on true greatness. But gets my award for hottest nude scenes.It has a very attractive DVD box cover. Image shown here. Reminiscent of the paintings of the old masters. I stumbled across it when researching Emily Browning checking up on her other work - I am a SUCKER PUNCH fan (I hear just about everybody else disses it, but I would never!), I liked her in it, and recommend that one highly - and when I learned about SLEEPING BEAUTY I was immediately intrigued, no, hooked - despite the strings and strings of overriding mostly negative comment I encountered here on IMDb. There's one guy here on the board post that even snickered about her feet, that was very off- putting, but I decided as I almost always do, check it out for myself, and am I glad that I did.First off, Emily Browning. Who doesn't want her Dad to see this movie. Hell, made me want to see it even more! Okay, Emily's acting, her screen presence, there is nothing that can be faulted. She plays a difficult-to-fathom character. Described as emotionless. No way. That is quite wrong, you've goofed, film analysts. She shows emotion in the last scene with Birdmann when she starts sobbing uncontrollably. She is generally coolly in control, but it is quite clear that she is simmering underneath. Okay, the only bit of weak acting by her is in that scream scene, she couldn't maintain it convincingly, her acting fizzles out there. Right then, on to the fun stuff: as for Emily's physicality, she has one of the prettiest faces, think living doll, plus she is petite, slim, pert, natural, tiny (ahem) upper structure, but very, very well- formed. And with the fairest complexion. All over white. All over... Gee baby!It is the most naked part in a mainstream movie. From the movies I have reviewed here, it takes over from CLOSER's Natalie Portman as the most intimate display by a lead actress. There's even a flash of pelvic thatch. Breasts small, not too small, very shapely, perky upright nips. She is like a child, only matured. An innocent doll. Who, lying supine, gets straddled by that naked disgusting threatening troll licking her face as if she's an ice-cream cone. (Which she kinda is, definitely vanilla by her skin color!) And that other guy, carrying her, dropping her? Wince-worthy! One long uninterrupted scene, didn't yell, remains seemingly out like a light, real trooper of an actress. Strong content, the nudity. Brings to mind scenes from SALO, 120 DAYS OF SODOM, those down-on-the-floor kneeling in supplication 'servants' showing their bare backs, foot-soles and butt- ends. I think that's the most explicit nudity in any mainstream movie. Together with the slightly S&M-ey bare-breasted waitresses, there's enough for a legion of prudes to complain about all week long. Yet there's no sex. Thought the 'madam' was gonna jump her there at the end, but, okay, I misunderstood... :)The movie itself? I have viewed it twice, I am actually still quite confused, have done some Plot research on Wikipedia to clear it up, now understand what I was supposed to understand. Lots of things said there doesn't balance with what I have just seen. Birdmann didn't die in her arms. Not in the IFC DVD release I just saw. I've even checked up again. So somebody on Wikipedia didn't pay proper heed. And what's mentioned as a funeral on Wikipedia sure looks like a garden party to me, glasses of beer and all. Another scene baffling me: After having slept with that guy, as she gets dressed, an insistent knock on the door. She continues getting dressed, another knock. She then moves to open the door, the next moment, she is sitting there in the corridor, some other guy (who's he?) standing near her, as the first guy pokes his head past the door, as if he's the one responding to the knock. Some deleted scene there?But many of the secondary characters were extremely sketchily presented. Like, who is that, and why are they...?And why why why waste time with that old man telling that never-ending story that did not did not did not further the plot in the teensiest bit? Was it akin to product placement, the author of that book mentioned? If it had been to establish the old guy as an acceptable character, there'd have been plenty more economic ways. Simply an ""I feel old and weak and dearly in need of this lovely young girl's presence"" not that long-winded story lasting eight rolls of film, shucks, I had time to boil a cup of tea and let the dog go do his business (kidding, I don't have a dog).The movie is way out of tempo with Hollywood fare. Initially, my first complaint was that there are way too little close-ups, almost everything was at a distance. There is also a certain meandering style, like this needed some discipline, some stronger direction, but then again, the cinematography in some scenes were very good, like paintings, for instance in that scene with the brutal man where she falls on the floor. Her marble-white skin on the green rug...Generally, I am not going to say too much against it, save that there remained lots of room for improvement. They were on the right track here, but the real winner it could have been got clear away, but yet, a prize catch was netted.",Sleeping Beauty

She goes to the interview with some strict woman who tells her that her vagina won't be penetrated and that they value discretion above else. They inspect her mouth and skin and then have her cleaned up and made up. Her first job is to serve drinks wearing a bikini for some club of old very rich geysers, while other topless girls serve fancy food. She does well and is called back. Now she's drugged and while she sleeps an old guy can do to her whatever he wants, except penetration. Things get weird as one can imagine.Lucy is kicked out of her apartment and leases a fancy room in a high-rise. The sick guy dies, which seriously affects her. She loses her clerical job. When she sees a sleeping woman on a train she's intrigued and panics. She requests to see what goes on when she sleeps but is rebuffed by the woman. One of the old guys requests as a last wish to drink the sleeping drug and dies sleeping with Lucy, which freaks her out when she wakes up. Apparently he even had some wishes for after his death, which I guess is shown in the final scene but it's not clear.Ordinarily, I'm more than happy to interpret a movie, but Sleeping Beauty doesn't want to be interpreted. It gives you little to go on and it doesn't give you a reason to care. There's very little dialogue and most of that is utterly meaningless. There are three longer monologues which I guess are supposed to be meaningful. One by Lucy's sick friend about a marsupial mouse, the other two by one of the old guys. There's only one instance that tells us something about Lucy's past. For the most part this movie's scenes are meant to look like living still life. The camera is usually motionless in the center of a symmetric setting. The movie has a cold greenish look to it, strange for an Australian movie. A shame because a warmer color would have gone much better with Browning's naked body. The tone is also cold and distant. Not even Lucy manages to get us to connect with her. As most reviewers mention, there's no shortage of pointless scenes: Lucy sleeping naked, suddenly waking up, just to put on underpants; Lucy walking between buildings, Lucy doing drugs. Lucy is clearly up for anything, but when sick guy asks to watch porn with her, she refuses.This movie aims for subtlety but overdoes it. What are we to make of all the death surrounding the young Lucy? Of a movie that focuses on sex but whose characters are incapable of it? In the one, single intriguing scene we see the face of the woman/madam not her usual confident self as she listens to one of the old guys and there she looks like an older Lucy. Even though this movie has little going for it aside from the lovely Emily Browning, it's oddly watchable for its Australian good-nature, despite the questionable theme.",Sleeping Beauty
15,s3276169,An insight into contemporary societal dispossession....,7,11 August 2015,"Sleeping Beauty is based on the novel The House of the Sleeping Beauties, by Yasunari Kawabata. Its a tale of a young woman, who, dressed in very little, waits on and, as the film progresses, eventually sleeps, in a drugged state, with wealthy older men. No sex takes place, the men are only allowed to touch her, a rule outlined and enforced by the upper class madam, who farms the girls out to her prominent clients. Sleeping Beauty is not an easy film to come to grips with. On the surface the overriding feeling is one of emotional and societal nihilism, expressed through a sexual medium. Delving deeper the real heart of the story would appear to be one of dispossession. The loss of one's self, which leads to nihilistic behavior on the part of its key protagonists. Lucy, a university student experiences loss of home, family and her best friend.Her world is a cold place, inhibited by people who are indifferent to Lucy and only see her in terms of her ""value"" to them. Lucy's response to being treated as a commodity, is, to play her would be users at their own game, selling herself to the highest bidder. Lucy uses they money she is paid to create her own shallow, materialistic world. Predictably, however, money does not fill Lucy's emotional void any more than it does the other key protagonists of this film, her wealthy clients. Lucy's clients are, in their own way, no different to Lucy. Like Lucy money has not freed them from their emotional bonds but has, in fact, bound them more tightly. Money obliges them to follow societal expectations in terms of their family and working lives, leaving them bereft and empty. Their attempts to escape their personal dispossession, play out in the perversely erotic fantasy world they share with Lucy.In terms of acting and directing, this is a polished film. The quality of acting, in particular, is of a very high standard.The overall direction of the film is well managed too but the atmosphere of impersonal coldness that inhibits the film is overplayed. As a consequence, its very hard to empathize with Lucy, even though, intellectually, you know you should. The moments of humanity and warmth are simply far too few. In summary, I would say Sleeping Beauty is certainly a quality film. That said, its not a great film. Its too clinical in its treatment of the subject matter, leaving the viewer numbed by the experience. Its an unwelcome departure from the book, which handles the subject matter with more humanity. Nonetheless a good effort and a worthwhile watch. Seven out of ten from me.",Sleeping Beauty

File this one in the same bin as EVERLASTING SECRET FAMILY - wants to be shocking & profound but ends up dumb/nasty.The sensational elements mainly consist of Browning getting further undressed each time out and introduced to more humiliation. However the viewer is distracted by wondering how she manages to fit in her tertiary maths course, a day time job collating documents that you'd expect the machine in the same room to do, second job at the cafe, visiting a dried out case who has museli and gin for breakfast, getting picked up in bars and hiring on as a fetish object. Lets not start in on why she burns the hundred dollar note in sustained shot, like the opening with white coat shoving a tube down her throat.The photography is quite pro and cutting rare - most scenes play without any inserts.

Emily Browning stars as a young woman who makes her money in every way she can although seemingly not needing the money . She get a job as a nude silver service waitress for a strange group of retired man and woman and it involves a ritual of which she could never have imagined.Although this film is extremely strange and obviously has hidden meanings that are so hidden i couldn't find them , i still found this film to very watchable. Emily Browning is stunningly beautiful and i could watch her all day long and i think that's the hook i had on this film.I can't see this film appealing to many people but i wouldn't say it's a total disaster.

18,p-stepien,Sleepwalking Beauty,3,11 May 2013,"Lucy (a revelatory performance in an otherwise underwhelming feature by Emily Browning), a university student, takes on various odd jobs in order to survive. Despite working multiple odd-jobs working as a waitress, a copy assistant or a test subject, while occasionally picking up well-off men at high-end pubs, she barely makes ends meet, unable even to pay her rent (timewise and money-wise drop any attempt to find this logically feasible, as any rational scriptwriting is shunned for the sake of 'artistic' impact). Living in an alternate universe with a 36 hour day Lucy decides to enter another employ - this time as a very well-paid per-job waitress for a lingerie silver service. This in turn leads to another job proposal - to play the role of Sleeping Beauty for wealthy (mostly old) men with somewhat special preferences...Detached from higher sensibilities each line of work is instrumental for gaining money, an end to itself, as Lucy seems to have no apparent well-conceived needs, instead with an almost nihilistic need for possession - a direction-less victim of societal expectations. The idea of possessing money seems a goal in itself, with Lucy unceremoniously burning some of her earned dollars celebrating the notion that she 'has money to burn'. Here each line of work has a sense of rape of individuality, with tubes penetrating her body in her 'normal work' as a test subject. In some sense the sexual role of Sleeping Beauty offers her better conditions through the strict non-penetration rule, making her a youthful doll to be admired and cherished, unlike in normal life, where she is disregarded. Despite this objectification of hes fetishist employ the monetary gratification in some sense help empower her, while at the same time causing her to become more vulnerable.Despite some intriguing artistic ongoings intertwined within the movie is an opaque and dull watch, probably the most sleep-inducing movie ever to have half of its screen-time focused on a naked beautiful girl. Emily Browning exposes her body right, left and centre, but the overall cold aesthetic effectively (and purposefully) remove any sensuality or eroticism from proceedings, instead imprinting a dreary uneventful tone of drab boredom. Overall Lucy's character, detached from background or any wider perspective, lacks charm (Emily Browning pulls off a great performance, so she herself is not at fault for the director's misgivings) and appeal to manage to breath life into the monotone uneventful story. Obviously sophomoric from writer Julia Leigh the movie further loses footing due to striking thematic and aesthetic similarity to the vastly better ""Shame"".Lacking any power and overladen with art-house style scenes (borderline forced with severe touches of pretentionality), the movie lacks cinematic language (with severing bland narrative) to convey the more poignant content lingering just around the corner. An overreach of style ""Sleeping Beauty"" will likely disengage even many an art-house audience. Instead it is half expected that most viewers take example from the titular Sleeping Beauty and catch a nap midway into the runtime.",Sleeping Beauty
19,Kingslaay,Not all bad,6,23 May 2021,"Sleeping Beauty is intriguing and shocking in parts. There is no easing into anything here, the film is unapologetic and wastes no time. It does cast a light on the realities some young woman face and the choices they make. While the sleeping element may not exist a lot of woman do various jobs to make ends meet. Sex and youth sell. In the society we live in the ones with a lot of wealth and power tend to be on the older side and the young have to be open to odd requests to see some coin. The film is almost a snapshot in time of the life of a young woman and some of the things she feels she needs to do to survive. I wonder what her life will be in 50+ years time, when she is on the older side? Will too succumb to such a depraved lifestyle and the cycle repeats itself?",Sleeping Beauty

A young girl gets involves herself into W****house, where she doesn't have to prostitute herself but let herself to sleep for hours while other abuse her body in most disguising way. The subject matter of the movie is shocking and it shows us a side of people under their suits. How far humans can go for to fulfill their twisted fetishes? Human may have started wearing clothes and behaved civilized but under closed doors they're worst than animals. For me watching Emily Browning in such an erotic role was surprising. Watching her for the first time in Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events with Jim Carrey to this is defiantly a surprise. Emily Browning has done a tremendous job, not only she is stunningly beautiful but she allows herself to go that raunchier in it. Michael Dorman was okay. On the whole the movie is good but it doesn't show us the purpose of making it. Was it just a shock value or director could not go more into the reason behind these psychotic fetishes?",Sleeping Beauty
21,oneguyrambling,This isn't art. This isn't poetry. This isn't good.,3,20 April 2012,"The movie is called Sleeping Beauty.Women who watch might call it Stupid Beauty.Guys will see it as Sleeping Booty.I see it as an amazing feat for star Emily Browning, who managed to segue effortlessly from her role as the scantily clad pouting idiot in the execrable Sucker Punch into this. The film that I would choose Sucker Punch over.Hang on, I just threw up in my mouth.By day Beauty is an everyday teen, juggling school and multiple part time jobs and supplementing her income with submitting herself as a test bunny for medical and/or scientific research, (apparently into how long a woman can have a tube in her mouth without vomiting). She is apparently so busy that she never sees the Australian sun – albino Eskimos have better tans than Emily Browning.Personal relationships seem fleeting at best, and generally see Beauty placating various people, an alcoholic (possibly abusive) mother, a friend with addiction, and more mundanely flatmates by coming up with the rent on time and doing some cleaning.By day she is known as Lucy.The evenings are spent with casual drinking, drug-taking and prostitution After responding to a classified as Beauty finds what she sees as a promotion. No longer casual and freelance, she now gets to wear a uniform and serve clients – only her uniform is by no means in the Macca's style, and her clients are little more than rich old pervs.By night she is known as Sara.'Sara's' boss/madam/pimp is Claire. Claire is prim, proper and demanding. The customer is always right, regardless of how messed up or creepy he is.The work is well paid but sporadic, but Beauty doesn't do it for the money. In one scene she casually burns a $100 note and watches it crinkle and melt without emotion. The 'job' involves nudity and submitting oneself to potential abuse and ridicule, but Beauty doesn't do it for titillation, satisfaction or compulsion. She just seems to do it. In fact, half way through the film I thought a better title might be The pasty girl who never says no. The phone rings, she answers, and with monotonous frequency heads of immediately at the caller's bidding.Whether the director meant this to appear empowering or pathetic is beyond me.Regardless of intent eventually Beauty finds another promotion, essentially becoming little more than the world's largest Pillow Pet for essentially the same clientele.We learn practically nothing about Lisa/Sara/Beauty. The film has little music, minimal dialogue and moves at a languid pace like melted icecream down a kerb, but I would argue watching this is more of a tragedy than dropping your Drumstick.Then with a scream it all finishes, and you wonder why. Keep your artsy. Save your fartsy for another day. To me this is 100% uncut dull and pointless fare. Sure we have an up and coming Hollywood starlet shedding her clothes frequently, apparently this is challenging, daring and mesmerizing.I just wonder how challenging, daring and mesmerising it would all be if – how you say? – a more natural woman was in the lead. Say the girl from Precious instead of Casper's sister Final Rating – 3 / 10. This isn't art. This isn't poetry. No-one learns lessons. No-one is better for the experience. What it is is a drab two hour exercise in making beautiful female nudity distasteful and unlikable. If anything that is perhaps the film's crowning – and only – achievement.",Sleeping Beauty
22,MrGKB,Unrelentingly pretentious twaddle...,3,14 June 2013,"...in which nudity is the only redeeming value, ""Sleeping Beauty"" is as soporific as its title suggests. Emily ""The Host"" Browning sleepwalks through her role of an anomic student who opts for some easy pin money by dozing her way through various somniferous episodes with old rich stiffs who aren't, and can't. Occasionally, she visits a dying friend, apparently in some vague attempt to connect on a genuine human level. How quaint, and unconvincing. At least she's not a cutter, but that may have been too interesting a story for first-time (and hopefully last) writer/director Julia ""I have raised boredom to a new level!"" Leigh. That this tedious bunkum was apparently touted by Jane ""The Piano"" Campion bedevils me. I'd watch it again to see if I somehow missed something germane, but my liberal employment of fast forward on first viewing tells me that's an unlikely prospect.Watch and yawn at your own risk; learn that naked bodies can be remarkably dull and uninspiring, even good-looking ones.",Sleeping Beauty
23,educallejero,More like a Nightmare?,1,23 August 2018,"Ok. I don't know if I ""got"" this movie. The protagonist is a girl working different jobs to pay for college. She's human, so she likes some druggs, alcohol and sex. That's all ok. But then, she sudenly gets a weid sexual job, and gets a promotion to a even weirder job, where she's paid to drink some drugg to laid naked and unconscious so some old farts can do whatever with her body, except penetrating her. So that's the movie and I won't spoil it.What I got from it and its conclusion is some sort of metaphor on how she was already wasting her life on a not really significant life (without a working relationship and more than anything, druggs and alcohol) thus a parallel with that kind of job where she literally just ""sleeps"" while things happen to her. The ""you are not enjoying life"" tale has been done a gazillion times before and way better at every level. 
The dialogue is not absurd enough to pair with the weirdness of the movie. 
The acting is, probably purposely, empty.
The movie doesn't have any comedy, so you have to take it at face value and super seriously.
And its disturbing like a Black Mirror episode, but less entertaining and it doesn't leave you thinking after it ends.

At least the madam has a rule of no penetration so she doesn't get raped while she is drugged.I have no clue as to her motivation for this or what the hell is going on with most any of the characters in this show. I think this might be what used to be called an artistic film. Lucy does major drugs, shows up at a night club where offers some guy fellatio, Idon't know if it was part of her job with the weirdos or just her seeming bent for self destruction.

With a very boring but also gross beginning and a sudden and unexplained finale, it is very simple to describe this movie in a single word which is pointless. It presents a stupid idea which it takes to a point where it suddenly stops. It is truly idiotic. Such nudity and such events to describe absolutely nothing. A girl who was already playing the role of a prostitute (but not as obvious as real ones) goes into a world where she didn't have to do anything... just stand there naked while others satisfied themselves with her. I can't imagine how the main actress accepted this role because I've seen a couple of other movies with her in which she had a pretty good performance (not that she played it badly in this one).Truly retarded I must say, I am really sorry that I wasted an hour and a half of my life to watch this senseless misery.

27,Likes_Ninjas90,It's difficult to fault the film's artistry and its originality,7,21 June 2011,"Lucy (Emily Browning) is a student working on a number of jobs. She's a waitress, she works in an office and she's involved with a science experiment at her university too. She's not co-operating with her housemates though and the rent is overdue. When she sees an ad in the paper she applies for it. She's driven to a manor house where she meets Clara (Rachael Blake). Clara describes the job, which involves Lucy being sedated in a bed and allowing men to watch her sleep. Lucy is assured that she will not be penetrated. Her first task with several other women is to serve a group of old men dinner at the manor house. After this she is put in a deep sleep and studied individually by three different men. Outside her job, one of Lucy's few relationships is with an old friend of hers called Birdmann (Ewen Leslie), a recovering alcoholic. Sleeping Beauty, the directional debut of Julia Leigh, is a film strictly for those seeking a more challenging and ambiguous brand of cinema. Its minimalism and utter restraint works mostly for rather than against its purpose. The film is richly successful in creating a world that's entirely consuming and isolating for its protagonist. Leigh relies on desaturation, like white colour palettes, to visualise this alienation. The majority of the film is also elegantly photographed at a distance using a wide angle shot to represent the isolation as Lucy becomes an individual, overwhelmed by her surroundings. Save for a misplaced phone box, it was pleasing to see a familiar location, with numerous scenes being shot at the University of Sydney. Leigh has an equally skillful understanding of the power of silence too. Music is almost nonexistent and the dialogue is sparing so we rely entirely on our vision here; making the film compelling and tense for its entirety. And it's extremely leisurely paced too, holding scenes for a very long time, with particular still framing, from a near-invisible camera. These formal aspects work to produce a dream-like state of slow, concentrated and delicate movements. As each scene fades to black, like the shutting of an eyelid, it becomes increasingly apparent that Lucy is almost sleeping walking through her life, with no prince to wake her up. Rather mistakenly, a lot will be made about the film's morally ambiguous view of sexuality. The film does not include any sex scenes. It is a strict rule of the organisation that there is no penetration. As suggested by the composition, the film is more fascinatingly occupied by voyeuristic tendencies but also the desire to awaken our deepest fantasies. This is visualised through a number of scenes at the manor house. The first is the most confronting, where topless women, covered in thin, revealing straps, cater for old men as they poor them drinks and serve them dinner. It's gratuitous but that's precisely the point because its one geezers bizarre fantasy to another. There are three additional encounters in the bedroom itself: one man who is lightly physically, moving his hands across Lucy's back; another who is intensely aggressive and the third is someone who simply mishandles her. The contrast to this is Lucy who as the sleeping beauty can only realise her fantasies through words. The dialogue drifts between outright coarse and maddeningly cryptic. Lucy asks her friend Birdmann if he'll marry her, not as a proposal, but as self-assurance. This suggests again that the characters in Leigh's world need to hear what they want to hear to be satisfied. The film falters with these side characters like Birdmann because we don't know enough about them and they tend to fade in and out of the film for lengthy stretches of time. And some will lament Emily Browning's subdued performance for its lack of personality but given the dream-like state of her character it actually suits the film. Her slender frame too makes her a particularly diminutive outcast. The film's ambiguity, isolation and peculiarity, will be detrimental for a lot of viewers. It's unlikely to attract big audiences because it is a slow, unnerving experience. But it's difficult to fault the film's artistry and its originality. Some people at the screening I went to left early. More fool them. I kept watching.",Sleeping Beauty
28,PeterMitchell-506-564364,Sleep on it,6,16 November 2012,"One thing I can say about Sleeping Beauty, it is bloody original. Don't you just love it's title. This only heightened my interest. The story could be fantasy, or it could real, or may'be part fantasy. Sadly some of the scenes fall flat on their face, a couple of others are just flat out boring. Take the first scene. Our ravishing beauty, Lucy (the lovely Emily Browning) who looks tasty in lingerie with the perfect of figures, walks into this room, probably a hospital, where this guy inserts something into her mouth. She's obviously a volunteer in a Semax kind of job. You'll understand, if you're an Adelaideein. She also works in an office and a restaurant. At this one Sydney singles bar, she goes home with men of fathering age to have sex. In one early scene, she puts the smile on the face of one lucky winner, the better looking of the two, after winning a three toin coss. This guy's also older. When does she sleep, hey? Well that could be when her life really happens? But back to the hospital room, we nearly wait one whole minute for Emily's entrance, where we just watch this guy set up this device. BO-RING. Only a series of tasty scenes with Browning naked, semi clad, make up for it. Lucy shares this townhouse, with two other young flatmates, if you can call em' that. She also goes to university, so we have one tired lass. So tired, she likes to take little catnap on the floors of the office she works. Struggling to make ends meat, as obviously her two other housos are sort of freeloading, she answers yet another ad, but this is no ordinary ad. It's an ad for an exotic hostess in lingerie in this mansion, where they serve these refined, mostly creepy sort of 60 something men, though there's a woman as well. God knows what her thing is. These richly shot scenes work well. Little Lucy is among slightly older lingerie waitresses, with overdone make up, their breasts showing through their ugly corsets, all of them ugly compared to her. Another weird scene has Emily serving them drinks, her open breasts, slightly protruding about her fabric, as two other women are knelt down beside the fireplace, with their moons showing during the whole erotic display, that immediately had me thinking of similar scenes in Eyes Wide Shut. This rich clientele men are the same men that have sex with her, without her knowledge, as she's drugged. Only one rule for these men, that's a drag. No penetration. We see these men get full frontal. The camera's not afraid at all to show these men, or Browning in close shots, also ones of her getting done by this sixty something guys. The first old guy, the best looking out of the three, provides the movie's boring scene. Prefore to stripping down and having sex with our beauty, he tells a five minute story, to a madam sort of figure, Clara who runs the place. It's so bland and dead boring, you almost want him to cark it. It's actually one of the most boring scenes I've witnessed in my whole movie watching history. The second old guy, yes that is legendary actor, Chris Haywood show's a horrid dislike for our beauty, purposely tripping her up in the dinner room. While in the bedroom, he gets atop her and licks her face while keeping her mouth open, lips protracted and using some quick shocking expletives. Even before he strips, well he does have his shirt unbuttoned, he drops a bit of hot ash from his lit cigarette onto Lucy's face. We see her face wince for a moment, but also with this, a look of anger and repulsion. Haywood says this great line about viagra that stays with me. The scene with the third client, Hugh Keays Byrne, looking somewhat very different from the toecutter he played in Mad Max, just tossing naked Lucy around like she was a pillow, is just stupid and pointless. What the hell was that? May'be it was what the Lucy character thought she only amounted to, and like the deal of this movie, it doesn't really add up to the much either. I take my hat off to Emily Browning for her brave tour de force performance. And that's what a real actress is, someone who can tackle real challenging roles like this. This is one actress you shouldn't sell short. In my opinion she's of higher acting stature, to Teresa Palmer or Isabel Lucas. You name it. That Oscar nomination has to be somewhere around the corner for this lass. You show em' Emily. I couldn't watch a second viewing of Sleeping Beauty, without having to fast forward through a couple of scenes, but with Emily naked, part naked, those scenes would warrant a quick re watch. Sleeping Beauty's ending is quite a shock climax, then one of sheer relief, where Lucy has sex in this special room that earlier in the film, sees another spunky young chick, drugged, being quickly escorted towards a waiting limo as she just steps out of hers. Definitely, something different, but not for all tastes. Let's hope there isn't a sequel. And again I must add, Emily looks darn hot in lingerie.",Sleeping Beauty
29,rubenm,Complete emptiness,2,7 February 2012,"I had a very hard time finding any quality in this movie. No story to speak of, no characters to identify with, no humor, no suspense, no intelligent dialog, no message, no link to what actually happens in the real world. And I could go on. The movie is filled with seemingly unrelated scenes, incomprehensible images and people talking nonsense. It is about a female student sleeping with old men for money, without really having sex with them. Sounds weird? It is. There is a slight possibility that I missed the point. That the film has certain qualities I wasn't able to discover. Therefore, I read some of the other reviews posted on this site. As far as I could see, they vary from extremely negative to mildly negative. So, if the film has qualities I didn't discover, at least I'm not the only one. I left the cinema with a feeling of complete emptiness. I had just spent 102 minutes watching something I couldn't relate to at all, something that couldn't offer me anything appealing. The only reason I didn't give this film the lowest rating of 1 star is the actress, Emily Browning. Not for her acting accomplishments (it consists mainly of being nude or semi-nude and showing no emotion at all) but for the audacity it took to accept this part. I only hope she doesn't regret it.",Sleeping Beauty
30,dragokin,narrative fiction,2,30 March 2014,"Someone's recently told me the how value of narrative fiction isn't limited to the plot line. This is usually used as an excuse by the authors to do whatever they want with their movie and claim they used alternative means of storytelling, be it random images or complete absence of plot.Sleeping Beauty didn't go that far since it has a plot, although it becomes blurred as we progress through the movie. At the same time, it used endless shots with music to underline the supposed importance of the scene in order to create tension.I see that a lot of people mention Stanley Kubrick's influence which i found misleading. In my opinion, the main influence comes from David Lynch's direction. Sleeping Beauty shares his use of long shots occasionally filled with weird images. Overall, the scriptwriter either didn't have the enough ideas to write or simply left it unfinished in order to get closer to some kind of ideal narrative fiction.",Sleeping Beauty

In many scenes the actors stare at one another like complete strangers at a tech support networking event. Given minimal dialog and stage direction that largely amounts to ""pretend you are at a fancy, perverted, dinner"" there is a lot of uncomfortable shuffling of positions and awkward silences. After a lot of nothing happens the first, seemingly, 16 hours of the picture, eventually Julia Leigh gives up and just starts contriving far-fetched reasons to see charisma- challenged Emily Browning naked. Another 10 hours in and basically it just the laconic and implacable Browning full-frontal long, long after it has lost its nominal power to charm.

Julia Leigh had some interesting ideas when it came to her approach, but I don't think she executed them well enough and as a result the film was just void of anything really. Obviously there wasn't going to be much by way of emotional influence, but there wasn't much on an intellectual level either. People are praising Emily Browning's performance as being incredibly ""brave"", which I suppose it is in the sense that it's brave to take off your clothes and have the things done to her on screen happen, but that doesn't make it a particularly good performance. She's not a competent actress by any means and this is just the strongest example of that so far.",Sleeping Beauty
33,Chris_Pandolfi,Art for Art's Sake,5,2 December 2011,"You will see the title ""Sleeping Beauty"" and automatically conjure up images of either the original fairy tale, the Tchaikovsky ballet, or the 1959 Disney film – most likely the latter. Indeed, this new film is like all incarnations of the story in that it's about a young maiden who will at some point be put into a deep sleep. But to deal with this upfront, this is where the similarities end. ""Sleeping Beauty,"" which marks the directorial debut of Australian novelist Julia Leigh, belongs in an unclassifiable gray zone between erotica and pornography. Although it has the gratuitous nudity men prefer, it will not appeal to their appetite for graphic depictions of intercourse. Likewise, women may respond to the sensual intimacy, but they will surely be put off by the cold detachment with which the story is told.I am, of course, speaking in general terms. Who am I to say what you personally will find sexually stimulating? For my money, the film is pretentious art – provocative and visually sumptuous but thematically impenetrable. It is, essentially, the embodiment of art for art's sake, which states that the intrinsic value of art is completely separate from functions deemed edifying or moral. If you can accept the fact that this movie looks pretty but says absolutely nothing about its characters, its plot, or even its views on sexuality, then perhaps it's worth going to see. You can study at depth the framing, the human form, the distinctive art direction, and especially the disturbing dreaminess of the bedroom set, where the title character lies helplessly in induced slumber.The film stars Emily Browning as Lucy, a college student and a deep mystery. Her dialogue is sparse and we only get scraps of her personal life, but there's just enough for us to formulate a rough outline: Her unseen mother is financially dependent and a violent alcoholic; she feels emotionally responsible, for reasons known only to her, for a teetering addict known only as Birdman (Ewen Leslie); she's behind on her rent and doesn't make enough working as both a café waitress, piling chairs onto tables after hours, and an office assistant, making endless copies and dealing with her stuffy boss. Her situation is obvious, but what motivates her is anyone's guess. Her attitude towards sex, we will repeatedly observe, is curiously opaque. In an early scene at a swanky bar, for example, she sits by idly as two men flip a coin to determine who will sleep with her and when. Take note of the fact that one of them uses the singular form of the word ""heads.""To supplement her income, she takes a job with a madam named Clara (Rachael Blake), who initially puts her to work as a lingerie waitress, pouring wine at upscale dinner parties where the guests wear tuxes. Later on, at a secluded countryside estate, Lucy is ""promoted"" to the rank of sleeping beauty; she's made to drink a powerful anesthesia brewed like tea, lie naked on a bed in an ornate bedroom, and remain unconscious as sexually frustrated elderly men have their way with her. The first, known only as Man 1 (Peter Carroll), compares at length his unfulfilled life with that of Ingeborg Bachmann's story ""The Thirtieth Year."" Man 2 (Chris Haywood) can only light a cigarette and explain how necessary Viagra is for him. Clara, who listens to their tales of woe, stipulates that there's to be absolutely no penetration.Leigh has a healthy interest in Browning's nude form, and indeed, her beauty seems to have been lifted directly from a Goya painting: Snow white skin, hair that flows down to her shoulders, breasts that are humble but shapely, curvy hips that naturally extend from her slender waist. What bothers me is that this is applied to a character so complex that she's completely unsolvable. Her maddeningly casual attitude towards sex, coupled with alarming passivity, allows for moments of unsettling objectification. Some are imposed, as when she's instructed to paint her lips the same color as her labia. Others are self-induced, as when she proclaims, with just a hint of anger, that her vagina is not a temple. And consider two scenes in a lab, in which a medical student carefully inserts a plastic tube down her throat and into her esophagus.What does any of this mean? Leigh is not the only one viewing things from a distance; she has written the characters to be just as emotionally walled off. If ""Sleeping Beauty"" is in fact making a thematic statement, it's done in such a way that it's undetectable. The film's lack of purpose is only exacerbated by its awkward structure, in which Lucy's everyday life and extracurricular activities are intercut, and its ending, which doesn't feel like an ending at all but rather like the setup for something grander. The final scene, in which Lucy has her first understandable emotional reaction, involves a decision and an act that's dramatically and logistically nonsensical. Here's a film that spends more time getting us to think about what it's trying to say and less time actually saying it.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",Sleeping Beauty
34,jonathanruano,Sleeping Beauty,2,29 September 2012,"""Sleeping Beauty"" fails the basic test for any film: Is it interesting? The trailer for ""Sleeping Beauty"" is certainly interesting, suggesting a haunting, highly ambitious art house film that we used to get in the 1960s and 1970s. But what ""Sleeping Beauty"" has to offer falls way below that standard. Why is this? Well the plot, for starters, is persistently uninteresting. A beautiful university student Lucy (Emily Browning) is offered a strange, but lucrative job as a prostitute of sorts who (after being drugged) sleeps naked in a bed while very wealthy old men gaze upon her nakedness, lick her body parts and do every sexually depraved thing to her lifeless body except have intercourse with it. Initially this ritual was interesting -- and some of the scenes actually reminded me of the sexual depravity of Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salo which (unlike this film) was an even more ambitious failure -- but the initial interest wears off very quickly as this same old sexual ritual gets repeated again and again and again.But the problem with the plot goes beyond the repetition of an all-too-familiar ritual. Julia Leigh (who wrote and directed this picture) relishes in cold, austere, lethargic backdrops and the gloomy side of decadence. As a result, this film sinks under the weight of Leigh's obsessions to an even greater extent than Luchino Visconti's Ludwig (1971) which was criticized on similar grounds. But most disappointing of all, when watching this film, I did not learn anything new about sexuality, prostitution, a rich man's view of humanity, or even the amount of suffering that the upper class subjects the lower and middle classes to. Julia Leigh seems so fixated with the mansions and streets that her characters inhabit that she forgets that the whole purpose behind having a movie set is to allow for the telling of a story.What about the characters and the acting? The only character of interest in this entire film was the madam of the brothel Clara (Rachael Blake) who interviews Lucy for the job. But the Clara character is actually no more complicated or layered than the usual brothel madams that one finds in porno director Zalman King's Wild Orchid films. The title character of Lucy (Emily Browning), on the other hand, is even more dreary and presides over enigmatic portends. Why for instance does she seek the company of Birdmann (Ewen Leslie), even though their relations seem neither platonic nor romantic? Why does she break out in tears during certain parts of the film? Why does she accept the strange job of a lifeless corpse and why did she have the job of a prostitute on top of that? None of these questions are properly explained and so we never really develop any understanding of or empathy for Lucy's character throughout the film. It also does not help that the other characters are even more lifeless than she is.",Sleeping Beauty
35,gregking4,a rather dull and bland psychosexual drama,2,22 June 2011,"This new Australian film is a haunting erotic fairy tale that caused something of a controversy when it screened at Cannes earlier this year. Many will be drawn to the film to check out what all the fuss was about. No doubt they will be disappointed. As will the raincoat brigade, drawn by reports of full frontal nudity and the heavy sexual content of the film. Rather than a voyeuristic fantasy, Sleeping Beauty is a rather dull and bland psychosexual drama from Julia Leigh, a former novelist making her feature film debut here. Sleeping Beauty is a provocative but ultimately pointless study of sexual dynamics, female sexuality, liberation, and willing female submissiveness. Ace Aussie filmmaker Jane Campion (The Piano, etc has mentored Leigh and championed the film, and its easy to see her attraction to this film which explores familiar theme of female sexuality. But one wishes she had had more input into the filmmaking process. Lucy (played by Emily Browning, from Sucker Punch, etc) is a cash-strapped university student who is juggling three part-time jobs to make ends meet. In desperation, she takes on a high paying job in a high-end brothel. At first she starts out as a waitress, but is soon promoted to ""sleeping beauty"", which is when things become a little creepy. She is drugged, stripped, and, while unconscious, becomes a baby doll who is groped and caressed by older lonely men who do all manner of perverted things – except penetration, which is strictly forbidden – that border on the necrophilic. ""You will go to sleep; you will wake up. It will be as if those hours never existed,"" Clara calmly explains, but Lucy grows curious and wants to know what goes on while she is asleep. At one stage it seemed like there was going to be an orgy scene, rather like Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. Instead we get a strangely civil dinner party in which all the waitresses are scantily clad. There is something cold and detached about the sex scenes, which resemble Catherine Breillat's confronting oeuvre. This is a brave performance from Browning, who is nude or semi-naked for much of the time, yet manages to convey her emotionally fragile state. Rachael Blake (from Lantana, etc) is suitably cold and aloof as Clara, the madame of this high-class brothel that caters to a rather unusual clientele. The men who sleep with the narcoleptic Lucy are played by the urbane Peter Carroll, a sadistic and very creepy Chris Haywood, and a brutal Hugh Keayes-Byrne, who will forever be remembered as Toecutter from the original Mad Max. Unfortunately, Leigh's screenplay is sparse, and the overly pretentious dialogue is minimal and oblique, and gives little insight into character motivation. We are kept at a distance from the characters, and we feel little empathy or emotional connection with Lucy and her situation. We get very little backstory, apart from a few hints that point to her sense of desperation and worthlessness. Leigh's direction lacks flair, and when scenes are finished they slowly fade into black. However, the film has been beautifully shot by veteran cinematographer Geoffrey Simpson (Shine, Little Women, etc), who works with long takes and steady framing. His crisp images are gorgeous, and the film has a surface beauty that contrasts with its dark subject matter. However, it is hard to see what audience Leigh is aiming for with her film. Sleeping Beauty is a far cry from the familiar fairy tale and the animated Disney film from 1959. Given its unsettling subject matter and Leigh's frank approach, this is a film that will prove divisive and provoke debate over its artistic merits.",Sleeping Beauty
36,RockPortReview,Interesing to say the least!,8,3 April 2012,"Hot off this years Cannes Film Festival, Director Julia Leigh's debut film is striking, controversial, and a little I don't know what. With famed director Jane Campion as a producer, this film is given automatic street cred. Starring the beautiful and fair skinned Emily Browning who has recently been seen in ""Sucker Punch"" and ""The Uninvited"", ""Sleeping Beauty"" seems to be lacking a certain something.Browning plays Lucy a disenchanted college student who drifts through life working several jobs. She is a medical test subject, an office worker, and cleans tables at a café. We never get to know Lucy and what makes her tick and she is never really happy. She is extremely lonesome and seems to have suffered some sort of emotional trauma in her past. Her alcoholic mother calls her at one of her jobs and asks for money, but that is all we hear about her family. She answers an ad for a sort of waitress and is brought to a mansion that caters to a group exorbitantly rich perverts. This shady business is run Clara and operates like a sort of brothel. Lucy then agrees to be a sleeping beauty, which means she drinks a tea that knocks her out cold for a few hours while crusty old white men have their way with her. Although with the strict instruction that she not be penetrated.Browning gives an extremely brave and fearless performance. She is nude in several scenes an makes the best of the material given. But nudity alone can't help that fact that the story is lacking in character and motivation. Lucy is a very intriguing person and there is a lot going on inside her, but Leigh never shows or implies any of it on screen. She is also involved with a terminally ill man named Birdman, their whole relationship is a little sketchy and underdeveloped.Although I have to admit this movie is like a male film geeks paradise. You mean Baby Doll from ""Sucker Punch"" is in it, and she has several nude scenes? Yes and yes. The movie does have its faults and reeks of a first time director, but you really should see the movie for Emily Browning's performance because she really does do a great job.",Sleeping Beauty
37,Someguysomwhere,"""If she's unconscious, we ain't limp."" (Yeah, keep believing that.)",6,19 October 2011,"Nobody in the movie actually said the lines above but it is the clear implication when a bunch of wealthy, but sexually and emotionally impotent old men gratify themselves (sort of) with a drugged, unconscious young woman.A young woman (Lucy) is hired by a service that caters to old rich guys. It's kind of an Old Guys Club where scantily clad and semi-nude young women serve the members their meals and drinks, and such. Of particular note though -and hence the title- is that this young woman is later hired for extra duties that calls for her to take some drug that puts her to sleep while the old guys (individually) have there way with her (They wish!). However there is a stipulation of ""no penetration"" (Drats!) It is the offbeat nature of this movie and it's curious lead character that makes it interesting. If there were lots of movies like this I might have given it a lower rating (Someone else might have done it better, who knows). But this movie is kind of out there by itself. Another of those ""little movies"" giving big-budget productions the finger by being more interesting than many of them; doing more with less money but with more courage, intelligence, and originality. Lucy is a ""passive-aggressive"" harboring resentment against those who dominate her and herself for letting them. The movie is all about her curious way of living with and remedying this situation. Lucy fights back by being compliant -or pliant- take your pick. As well, by doing ""small things"" (petty) to get back at the powers that be. I had to feel sorry for her and chuckle at the same time when she took a handful of berries or something and dumped them quietly in the back of an expensive and well kept car. Another example of her ""getting back"" is that the first thing she did when she got her first payment for her services to the Old Guys Club is burn one of the bills. This she did not to their face, but quietly, by herself at home. That, in my humble opinion, was a big passive-aggressive ""F!!ck you!"" to the powers that be. There's a basic recklessness in Lucy that seems self-destructive. This young woman probably has never said ""No"" to any drug she's ever been offered. If you choose to see the movie you might wind up being an arm-chair psychologist like myself. So it's a movie that makes you think, makes you wonder, ""What's up with that girl?""There is a clear irony here: The old men are influential and rich but they're also sexually impotent. Lucy on the other hand, while not having their wealth, self-confidence, and influence is a potent sexual symbol; young, attractive, and desirable. Some of the old guys admire it, others resent it. Two types of cripples, then, drawn to each other. One needing youth, beauty, and sexual power and the other financially dependent on them and lacking the courage to stick up for herself; assert her own person. Finally, I'm thinking that if the old guys could have a boner they'd want Lucy awake to see it. Love, Boloxxxi.",Sleeping Beauty

No point discussing the usual cinematic aspects with this movie, even though the cinematography is pretty good. Nor is it a squeamishness about the sex that is bought and sold. Who cares about that?

Written (and I use the word loosely) by somebody who doesn't understand or hasn't bothered to learn the basics of working in film and apparently directed by the same person, the film blunders its way from pointless scene to pointless scene, filling in the gaps with dialogue so stilted you might as well be watching bad porn from Chatsworth.

Without her grasp of the demands of the role, the movie would certainly have failed. Due to Ms. Browning's talent - capturing the essence of a passively disengaged young woman, the film succeeds. As you may be aware, the plot of the movie is to follow the story of a young female who is willing to step outside social norms to make her way through the world. She hits upon a higher paying ""job"" in which she is clearly exploited, but which nonetheless accomplishes some of her goals, leaving us to wonder whose ends were served, and in what way.

It is stylishly shot in a comparatively low budget 'eyes wide shut' kind of way. The ending is as unsatisfying as the service offered must have been.

45,roland-scialom,A depressing stoy,8,12 April 2012,"All characters on the screen are decadent and has no existential consistency. I understand by ""existential consistency"": having a life project, and act pro-actively toward the realization of this project and so on. Lucy is a young woman who divides her activities between a strange college course, and part time activities in a bar as a waitress and as xerox operator in an office. She lives in a house in which she has a poor relationship with the other tenants who, by the way, are obnoxious and end up expelling her for failure to pay rent. She frequents nightclubs where she arranges sexual partners. The film is not clear about her relationship with these partners: is it prostitution? While she seeks for a way to increase her earnings, she starts to work for a pimp, Clara, who serves a clientèle of senior citizens, rich, sophisticated and degenerate. The role of Lucy in this prostitution scheme is to be offered naked and sedated to old impotent satyrs that use her to implement their pornographic fantasies, which, by the way do not allow penetration. The old men who hire the services of Clara are absolutely depressing. Clara is very competent professionally in serving her clientèle, and shows evidence of an exquisite taste and intelligence, and lives in style. This competence is also depressing. The alcoholic friend Lucy is a poor, devastated and self-destructive guy, with no personality. A depressing individual. The story end up with Lucy having a nerve crisis after awakening close to the corpse of one of Clara customers, who decided to commit suicide close to the sleeping beauty. Every move of Lucy is depressing. The reason why Clara awakes Lucy to make her get aware of what happened during her sleep, is not clear. Finally, a depressing story.

Modern 'dettachment'... separating the body from the heart, the soul, the mind. Most of the critics of this film seem to dwell on complaining that ""our world is not like that! All the people here are horrible...!!!"" Of course they are missing the point. We are watching crude realities, but also dreams, symbols, Freudian/Jungian fetishes... A woman is directing. Jane Campion is producing. This is also a 'clue' that MAYBE there is more to this film than meets the eye... Behind the veneer are MANY hidden truths.( Behind the Twin Towers, behind the choice of a black president after a guy like Bush jr.) Separation from the truth. We are all 'anaesthetised'... so Lisa is NOT so strange, after all. Money rules. Maybe we are victims of our society, of our times. We are 'dead', as T.S. Eliot wrote some years ago. Of course the world is full of wonderful, hearty, passionate and generous people. But this film aims elsewhere, and I myself feel grateful to its director, scriptwriter (and , why not, actress) for taking the plunge, and re-floating Pasolini's 'Salò' in a more digestible (maybe more intelligent?) guise. Kubrick? His last movie may still reveal something in the future (ALL his films age very well), but he was an elderly man, and this young director seems to have the upper-hand in as much as hitting the nail on the head with the 'ésprit-du-temps', the 'Zeitgeist' or, more plainly,(and painfully), the new age our youth are forced to grow up in.

Sleeping Beauty centers on a college student, Lucy, a college student who enters into a dark erotic world. Browning's performance was well done but it seems she's lost throughout the whole film. The cinematography was good. I got the impression that Leigh try to paint this film as like a portrait of Venus but fails miserably.

Eva Greene in The Dreamers is naked a great deal and she looks and behaves like a mature sexy woman. I am assuming that the old men are looking for a last 'thrill' with a girl. There is a no penetration rule, yet if you are going to die, would you not ignore that, if capable? Anything could happen to the girl if that scenario is the case, or have I got that wrong? (The brute with the cigarette for example) I hope that Ms. Browning's career doesn't take a nose dive after this movie and she doesn't just get offers of film parts where she has to strip as others have done after making films such as this.

50,Bloomer,Wearily negative,6,11 June 2011,"The depiction of human nature in this film is not completely miserable, but it's pretty miserable. Emily Browning plays the largely inscrutable Lisa, a university student in Sydney already exhibiting degrees of nihilistic behaviour before she signs on as a silver service lingerie waitress in a very weird, hoity-toity brothel of sorts. She quickly 'graduates' to the position of Sleeping Beauty in which, while voluntarily drugged and asleep, she becomes a sexual prop for grey-haired men rich enough to pay for the service. While asleep, she sees and knows nothing of what happens, but the audience of this film sees plenty. What is seen and heard is more disturbing than it is visually explicit, excepting the nudity of all involved, especially Browning's.The question is - what is all this about? It is beautifully designed and photographed in still, square-on Kubrick style, with minimal editing and music. There are degrees of suspense and disturbance, mystery and eroticism, but there isn't much of a vector for any of these elements. The characters are variously arch and obnoxious, cold, stupid, reckless and unkind. We know little about any of them, and most of what we do learn doesn't make much sense. Bizarrely, the kindest person in the film seems to be the madam of the brothel, played by a magnificently still Rachael Blake.I wondered, while watching Sleeping Beauty, how it was going to end itself. The final scene is pretty unsatisfying, given that the resolution depends on Lisa eventually seeking to find out what has been going on during her sleeps - something the audience doesn't just know already, but has watched at length as fact. And there is a twist which potentially confuses the denouement.There is no doubting that this film is an experience and finely made, but there's a strain of dumb misery and pessimism at work here along the lines of Catherine Breillat and Michael Haneke. Everybody is hopeless and unkind, they don't know what they want, they can't evolve, they don't want to evolve. Lisa seems interested in a promiscuous brand of self-destruction for reasons the audience basically has to invent. The whole film also teeters on the edge of being one of those pieces where every single man is depicted as being a sex-enslaved scumbag. What you're left with is an aesthetically interesting film with a strong sensibility, but which is wearily negative about everything, and whose ending is also a letdown on the film's own terms.",Sleeping Beauty

Presumably she needs the money, which is alluded to in that she has trouble paying her portion of the rent. But perhaps a more plain explanation of exactly what experiment is being visited upon her? Exactly why a balloon catheter is being slipped down her throat? Delve into her personality, why is she so detached seemingly from all but a select few? How does she know the recovering drug addict who's teetering on his sobriety vs. relapsing? Why, when he overdoses and is about to die, she doesn't attempt to obtain help (like most anyone else would), but takes her top off and climbs into bed with him? I can appreciate the nude female form, but when I'm faced with imminent death I think I'd prefer the medical attention And she's not even holding him and comforting him but rather he's holding her? Secondly delving into what the film is actually about, the Sleeping Beauty as it were, the film would've been better served with just how she came to be at such an extreme that she would accept a job from a stranger involving being sedated, put into a bed naked, then fondled, manhandled and whatever else short of penetration which she is assured won't happen cause it's a ""rule."" Well rules can be broken, particularly when you're unconscious and unable to even know whether or not it was enforced. I've never met you before, but after only a few minutes (probably a couple of hours in movie time), I'm going to strip myself nearly naked for inspection, allow myself to be sedated and whatever done to me because I have your ""assurance"" and I'll be well compensated afterwards.Now I can enjoy a good art house film, but in addition to the aforementioned which should've sent any sane girl for the door. The film becomes difficult to watch as in the first scene as the Beauty, while naked, she's inspected and caressed by a man old enough to be her grandfather before he snuggles with her lifeless form. In the second scene, her lifeless like body is accosted by an overweight tyrant of a man whom seems to slobber all over her head and perhaps burn her with a cigarette. The third gentleman simply picks her up but can't seem to support her (perhaps a heart condition is implied), so he nearly tosses her on the bed but because of the way Ms. Browning's weight is distributed she flops head first off the bed. A shout out to the acting ability of Ms. Browning in that she put up with each, particularly flopping on to the floor, without a detection or hint that she's only acting and not really unconscious (which I'm assuming even they wouldn't do for the sake of the script) as any girl were this to happen in the real world would've said that's it and ended any business relationship...The script for this movie could've been MUCH BETTER. It left me wondering just who writes this stuff? Say, our girl Lucy is hard up for cash to pay for her studies, a place to live and some spending money.While staying with whichever friend of the moment will have her, she appeals to the university office of financial aid and unfortunately there isn't much if anything that can be done for her. Before she leaves, a young student overhearing her dilemma drops her some advice about how she can pick up some cash doing dinner service at a party (albeit she finds out it requires nudity but she needs the cash). Alas this is on the edge of what she happens to be studying, and it doesn't seem so bad. Perhaps we even have a few scenes between the two girls so the second can fall into the background and it be believable. A few more dinner services go by but then the house mistress, for whatever reason, needs a new Sleeping Beauty on the spot. Promised an opportunity at advancement if she proves herself, Lucy accepts both for the increased compensation, but also as this flirts with the edges of what she's studying. Then over the course of several men, we watch as she journeys from being a researcher to embracing (or not) the lifestyle. She could even accept the position for the benefit of moving into the house and an increase in her quality of life as benefits.So there, I've just rewritten the movie so that it makes sense. It actually has a plot and a feasible script now which is what was lacking in this movie. After finishing this movie, I don't know how I did but I did, I looked up some reviews to try and make sense of it all and to assure myself I wasn't a perv for watching a little girl with men old enough to be her grandfather. I can't believe this film was so well received around the indie film circuit. Only because it was somehow well received and also an art house film rather than a mainstream release do I think it won't damage Ms. Browning's career.",Sleeping Beauty
55,justchillz,No ending,1,27 August 2017,What happened in the end? Nothing. There is no plot. I did not trust the negative reviews because they said stuff like obscure.

But this movie is just spectacular. I love Emily Browning, she is amazing, she is beautiful and talented. And her acting is just another level in this movie. I'm gonna admit that I love depressing movies. And this movie is surely depressing. But the director just caught that depression and turned into something beautiful. I loved the scenes and the colors, I think the shooting places are just beautiful. And I especially loved the concept. Some of you may say that this movie contains so much nudity and sexuality and yes, some of you are right. But the nudity of this movie is not dirty. It's pure and innocent. It comes from the suffers and depression of a girl, and it doesn't disturbs you. I surely enjoyed this movie, and I suggested it to many of my friends. It's not a movie for everybody, it has a small fan-base. But it's one of my favorites and I think it deserves a solid 8.",Sleeping Beauty
57,jinsilver,"Self-aware, cold, and interesting, but disconnection and overuse of repetition",4,17 March 2013,"This is the very definition of a pure art house movie - a must see once, but unwatchable and unlikely to ever be watchable. Nearly every individual scene is repeated at length, with subtle or large variations. The star is an passive alabaster ping-pong ball whose only active role in the first hour was contacting the agency the movie revolves around. Only in the last 20 minutes is there any minor transformation of character, and that only exists to repeat scenes with new variations.There are no people in this movie, only mannequins posed for maximum effect. It may as well be a series of paintings.Like much fashion photography, the movie is purely a set of intriguing yet disconnected scenes, with no whole. It is an endless stream of literary devices translated to the screen (if you enjoy playing spot the trope, you might love it). If there is any message, it's that interesting makes a mediocre substitute for substance, and terminal listlessness is incredibly difficult to watch. I was left shrugging, wondering why anyone would care.Even the unexpected, unexplained outburst of extreme emotion of the final scene exists simply to shock. My take is that like horror fans seek the high of ever-more-shocking films, art critics seek being ever more confused and disconnected, and this film delivers well.Hard to rate: 1/10 on enjoyment, 8/10 on visceral sensation, I guess I'll split the difference.",Sleeping Beauty
58,Marter2,Don't Fall Asleep. You Might Miss It!,7,20 December 2011,"When you create a film and title it ""Sleeping Beauty,"" you had better not make it boring. Otherwise, you'll get reviews utilizing every possible play on the word ""sleep,"" but more importantly, word of mouth will spread using the same types of puns. When you use a title made famous by the Disney animation, you're going to have to guard against those comparisons as well. As you can see, this film is already on the defensive.To put even more pressure on ""Sleeping Beauty,"" before it has even begun, is the fact that it is the directorial debut of a novelist. Julia Leigh also wrote the screenplay, but it is her first time stepping behind the camera to helm a film production. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it means an even bigger risk was taken by the studios, and just as many debuts fall flat as they do flourish. Luckily, Leigh's is a success, even if her film isn't going to be something that many people are going to enjoy.To start the film, we begin by watching the daily routine of a young woman named Lucy (Emily Browning). The first scene made me cringe, as we find out that one of her many jobs involves testing out medical equipment. We watch a tube being inserted down her throat. This is done in one unflinching shot that has the opposite effect on the viewer. Later on, we learn she also does office work and works at a restaurant, but the medical testing was by far her worst job.Why does she need to work three jobs? That's really a good question. We learn that she's behind on her rent, and also goes to school. Maybe school is really expensive, but she only seems to have one class, which can't be too heavy a burden. She's renting a room from people she knows, and I wouldn't think that would be that expensive either. Why she doesn't pay her rent on time, I'll never know. This isn't a film that's going to lay things out for you.Because working three jobs isn't enough for Lucy, she inquires about an ad in the paper that requires her to serve dinner to old rich men while wearing lingerie. It pays $250 an hour, although it's freelance work, we're told. She works once, and after she gets home, she burns a $20 bill. Why? Again, I don't know, and it's actions like this that make me think she isn't wanting for cash. Regardless, working multiple jobs, including the dinner-while-wearing-lingerie one, continues for most of the film, even as her performance gets so bad that she sometimes sleeps on the floor while working.Sleeping is something she'll end up doing quite a bit as the film continues on. She was told when she took the server job that there were opportunities for promotion. She gets that chance later on, when she's told that she can take a drug, lay naked in bed while passed out, and sleep for a few hours. Oh, and an elderly man will come in and sleep with her while she's knocked out. ""Sleep with"" in the literal sense of the meaning, as actual intercourse is forbidden.Not that Lucy really cares. She doesn't seem to care much about herself, and would probably have accepted the job without the binding rule. She's the type of nihilist that will do whatever anyone wants her to do at the flip of a coin. At a bar, she's approached and asked if she wants some cocaine. ""Why not?"" is her response. Later, two men she just met actually use a coin to decide which one would have sex with her that night. She doesn't care, although come to think of it, I can't remember her saying ""no"" once to anyone in the film. She's very polite, even if she has no regard for her own body.There's a lot of symbolism in the film, and if you thought this was a film that's going to make it easy on you, you can look elsewhere. You're going to have to infer a great deal about the characters and their reason for doing what they do for most of the time you watch them. I can see this being seen by some as a lack of character depth and development, but I think it's all there and just hidden behind imagery and a classic fairy tale. The way I saw ""Sleeping Beauty,"" it actually does steal a couple of things from Disney cartoon. Unfortunately, giving that away now might change the way you view the film, so instead, go in with as fresh a mind as you can. This is a movie that will reward subsequent viewings.If there's a problem here, it's the character of Lucy. She's often difficult to like, and because she's such an apathetic person, not a lot goes on. She's little farther, for better or worse, when the film ends than when it began. None of the blame can go to Emily Browning, as she plays her without fear, but the way the character is written means that she's not exactly amiable or has a decent enough personality to build a film around. This is largely forgotten about once it gets going, but upon reflection, making her grow as the film progressed would have improved it as a whole.Regardless, I was engaged by ""Sleeping Beauty."" Is it for everyone? Not at all. If you like artsy films that are there for you to figure out instead of being told everything about them, then it might work for you. It has a solid performance from Emily Browning in the lead role, and it has enough imagery and symbolism to keep you coming back for another watch. That is, if you don't fall asleep during the first time.",Sleeping Beauty
59,tomlu1,What's going to happen?,7,18 January 2013,"This movie often leads me to wonder what is going to happen to ""sleeping beauty""? The movie leaves you hanging with no ending. What exactly happened there? Is she dead? Does she want to die? But it clearly shows that she was alive that next morning with Clara trying to wake her. Or was it just a dream? A dream she never want to wake up from because of what she has committed herself too.She's doing everything she doesn't want to do. Inside, she knows it but nothing is holding her back. She has no support, no one really to be there for her. And I think her missing friendship, that spark of love was never there for her to realize all the mistakes she is making.Her quick way out? Make enough money to live. The fancy brothel is her way out. The title of the movie, ""Sleeping Beauty"" symbolizes her ""job"" in the movie. She sleeps through some kind of a mild drug while old men do what they please with her. I don't think she knows exactly what they do to her because she wakes up screaming towards the end. But what could that really mean? Why did the movie end with her sleeping still and not waking up? Overall, the movie is mysterious, causes you to think throughout. I rate it a seven which is pretty high for my taste, but if a movie makes you think, it deserves a higher score.",Sleeping Beauty
60,RedQueenIMDB,I get it...,4,12 April 2013,"This is a remarkably deep and curious art film that's far too frustrating and depressing to be enjoyed. It's more like a surrealist painting that takes two hours to make its statement. A very still movie, rather than showing a real sequence of events, it's more of a slice of a woman's life and her interactions with others, which are really all failed attempts by each character to validate what they want from others.It captures with uncanny perfection the experience of reaching out for sincerity only to be met endlessly with vicious coldness from other people. She's shocked into a state of frozen disbelief by this - Like a blanket of snow, choking out any warmth or feeling.Her interactions increase in wanton craziness - as if to pinch herself and see if it makes any difference - yet she continues to feel nothing. The sole exception being the pain of caring for a friend incapacitated by alcoholism.Her morbid curiosity leads her to discover just how deep their coldness goes, in a brothel. And even as she tries to close her eyes to it, the answer is revealed. As the madame wakes her up and consoles her through her screams of realization.",Sleeping Beauty
61,lynnfriedman,This Ain't Your Granny's Sleeping Beauty,6,2 June 2012,"Remember the Sleeping Beauty story of your childhood? You know, that family friendly, romantic fantasy musical? OK, now take out everything but the beautiful girl and the fantasy, add a lot of soft core and inexplicable behavior.The 2012 Sleeping Beauty is a complete enigma. I suppose it's about a young student exploring her sexuality, or maybe exploiting her body for financial gain. Ultimately I arrived at the conclusion that our lovely Lucy was searching for her true self. In the classic modern single gal mode she signed up for any and all experiences offered to her. All those drugs, unexplained relationships, just plain weird habits, and random sexual encounters added up to a modern upside down fairy tail. Instead of getting the prince, Lucy is searching for a genuine feeling. We don't have a clue what makes her tick and neither does she.For about an hour and a half you will be completely baffled by our lead character. Lucy is working her way through college by taking odd jobs such as a test rat in white walled labs and office drudgery in a perpetual paper pushing office. Who could blame Lucy for jumping at the chance of making some big bucks when she hooks up with a kinky temp agency.Initially she is hired to serve rich people food in some fancy private club. The catch? All the waitresses wear racy lingerie and allowed themselves to be admired/leered at by old men. But wait, there's more. Lucy keeps getting promoted to more challenging and lucrative assignments. Finally the audience gets to see the sleeping beauty reference. Not to spoil things for you, let me just say she drinks a potion, she sleeps, and old men do mysterious things to her. Yes, human sexuality can be perverse. You will see many examples of this, some full frontal, and behavior including random acts of unexpected kindness and disturbing brutality. This isn't your granny's Sleeping Beauty. Or if it is, she didn't write a book about it so you'll never know.",Sleeping Beauty

63,moviemajesty,A Whole Big Bunch of Nothing,4,4 January 2012,"Lucy, played by Emily Browning, is a young college girl who decides to make some money by taking a drug that puts her to sleep and letting old men do what ever they want with her. The film really was a drag and could have been about 30 minutes long. It seemed like every scene was prolonged, from the slow dialog, no music, and 10 second fade-to-back- screens. About half of the scenes seemed to have nothing to do with the plot and were completely random. And finally, the ending was just bizarre and seemed out of place.On the positive side, I did appreciate the film for its attempt at something different, as I can't really think of any movie I have ever seen like this. A few of the scenes of Lucy and an old man in the bed were fairly disturbing. I also enjoyed Emily Browning's performance, although she really didn't have to do much besides get naked.Overall, I wasn't a huge fan of the film, but I can appreciate it for trying something new. But I felt it was a bit too ""arty"" and definitely not for everyone.",Sleeping Beauty
64,njs-55801,"Emily Browning is excellent as Lucy, whose need for money and conflicted personality lead her into the fetish world",8,6 May 2015,"Emily Browning stars as Lucy, a young student, who enters the world of sexual fetishism under the tutelage of Clara, Rachel Blake. Lucy is drawn by the need for money, and her own character, a mix of passivity, repression and self-destructive forces. This is an absorbing and perplexing film, a character study that offers no explanations. Sleeping Beauty will get most attention for its portrayal of sex but sex is only a part of Lucy's story. The fetish scene she enters might be a fantasy but in the real world it's money that matters and the film is as much about money as about sex.In the early scenes we watch Lucy going through the motions. A couple of dead-end jobs, a stint as a medical test subject; her social life seems limited to hanging around wine-bars being picked up by men literally on the toss of a coin. An ad brings Lucy to a job interview with Clara, a formal and business-like Madame. Clara dispenses advice along with the job description and delivers the best line in the film: ""Your vagina will not be penetrated. Your vagina will be a temple!"" After this reassurance Lucy is ready for her new role as a silver service waitress clad in lingerie.Lucy does well enough to be promoted to the role of sleeping beauty and here we get to the real fetish heart of the film. We watch as Lucy, drugged to sleep, lies in bed as a series of old men climb in with her and, bearing in mind Clara's rule: ""no penetration"", live out their fantasies. These are disturbing scenes, although only the second man is actually abusive, unsettling too since, as in many fetish scenes, it is hard to figure out exactly what the fantasy is. None of the men seem to take any real sexual pleasure from the situation. Her passivity makes Lucy an object they can project their fantasies onto yet the fetish of watching women sleep is not wholly sexual. It is significant that only one of the men tries to play the typical sexual domineering role. The other two men carry out no sexual activity – man 1 has an agenda for Lucy which is physical but not sexual, as Lucy discovers to her horror at the end.Lucy is led into the fetish scene by her constant need for money. From her mother phoning her at work for money through her trouble in paying the rent to her limited wardrobe to searching phone box coin slots for money it's abundantly clear that Lucy always needs money. Showing this mundane aspect of Lucy's life doesn't just explain why she enters the world of sexual service but provides an effective counterpoint to that world. It anchors the film in real life, where people wear the same clothes every day because they have nothing else to wear, can't afford a train fare let alone the rent and have to do rubbish jobs they hate because they have no choice. Sleeping Beauty shows us two worlds: Lucy's passivity and self-destructive urges are the same in both, as in the scene where she picks up a 100 dollar note and burns it.Lucy's disconnect breaks down when she is confronted with sickness and death. The first time we see real emotion from her is when visiting her sick junkie friend Birdmann yet there's a sense that her tears are for herself as much as for him. Her relationship with him is not really explained but it does make sense, somehow, that someone like her would have a platonic friendship with someone like Birdmann, someone non-threatening, gentle and passive. The threat of that being taken away from her, of her life being unhinged is what provokes her. Maybe in the end we only ever cry for ourselves.The final scenes leave us with two images of Lucy to ponder. Man 1 has decided to end his life, with an overdose, lying in bed next to sleeping beauty. When Lucy awakes and discovers this she reacts with hysterical, impotent rage. He's used her to complete his journey and in so doing breached her indifference by forcing her to confront the ultimate reality in life: someone else's death. Finally we see her asleep, in a scene of perfect stillness. Watching her sleeping it's easy to see this as Lucy's ideal state, a place where she can hide from the truth: hell is other people.Sleeping Beauty has little narrative, not much dialogue and rather than a natural ending the film simply stops at a certain point in Lucy's life. The film's strength is its commitment to its characters and superb acting throughout. It avoids moralising about the sex industry and treats it prosaically, maintaining the realism of its characters who are brought to life entirely by the quality of the actors. We know nothing of the people in the film, their histories, even their surnames. They are presented to us in the moment. Emily Browning is extraordinary in portraying Lucy as at once shallow and deep, making a difficult character believable and fascinating. Rachel Blake as Clara has just the right mix of experience and authority and Ewen Leslie, as Birdmann, mixed charm with a wasted junkie passivity. The men in the sleeping beauty scenes deserve praise for their difficult roles. Chris Haywood as Man 2 was particularly strong, his character was a bad man with good dialogue. Man 1, elegantly played by Peter Carroll, was the only character in the film to make a substantial speech, he was engaging and rational which gave his suicide a real emotional depth.This is director Julia Leigh's first feature film and her direction is restrained, even minimal. The focus is always on the characters and this is a mature film that treats its characters and its audience as adults.",Sleeping Beauty

The premise of why she does what she does, multiple menial jobs, experimental testing and ultimately prostitution, both vanilla and niche, is completely overdone.

Her life just isn't that bad, she's not the only student whose ever had to work through college unsupported by family.

67,thulean33,Interesting study on feminine psychology; but too cold and utilitarian,6,16 October 2011,"The movie essentially explores the tragic aspects of being a submissive, beautiful woman that is largely powerless in a modern age where rich men with money dominate and that primarily value a woman only for her body. The lead character is Lucy, a unique beauty that is struggling paying her rent as she tries to survive on the wages of a common office clerk. Lucy is contacted by Clara who pays her $250 per hour to work at a house that is a kind of upscale brothel for older rich men.I was excited for this movie upon reading the summary and watching the trailer. I was expecting a fascinating exploration of feminine psychology and beauty and to see a beautifully artistic movie influenced by rich, classic expressions of architecture and art. I was expecting something more mysterious and elitist along the lines of some of the scenes in Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut.What I got instead was disappointing. I expected the mansion sets to be finer and more artistic. The mansion itself was more of a utilitarian, cookie cutter upper middle class house than a truly fine mansion with classical architecture. The bedroom set itself, wherein the scenes are the crux of the entire movie, was minimalistic, utilitarian, mechanistic, and looked more like an empty hotel room than a refuge for the rich. While I am OK with the story itself being essentially gloomy, nihilistic, haunting, and morbid, I needed a better contrast between Lucy's poor life as a struggling office clerk and the ""upscale"" clientele she services at the mansion. She essentially cycles between her drab utilitarian environment (the office, her house) to the ""mansion"", which itself is very minimalistic and utilitarian. Thats where the movie loses its appeal. There is little stylistically or artistically redeeming about the movie. It's really disappointing, because the movie could have been great. The screenplay was an interesting psychological exploration full of very good ideas and the acting was good. If the mansion scenes were finer stylistically and artistically it would have enhanced the contrast between Lucy's regular life and her life at the mansion and gave at least one redeeming quality about the movie.Instead the viewer is beaten down relentlessly with gloomy scene after gloomy scene. Instead of an uplifting appreciation of femininity, art, and beauty, you get a movie filled with hostility towards men, guilt for the exploitation of Lucy, and a miserable commentary on the injustices of being a woman.",Sleeping Beauty
68,vmoreno2007,A compelling movie about extremes of humanity,10,27 April 2012,"****spoiler alert, this review contains spoilers************* The movie is about a young University student, Lucy, just plodding through life emotionally detached holding various dead end jobs to support herself and put herself through school. The film is executed through minimal amount of dialogue and very little music, making for a compelling presentation of human emotions. The film relies much on the expressions of the actors and what is not said rather than what is said. You need to be open minded to watch this movie to really get it, in a world of cheesy Hollywood films and over the top action and far-our fantasy, this is surprisingly more realistic despite the dark nature. It shows the journey of a young woman who is so damaged by life she is uncaring of how she treats her temple. The only time we see a glimmer of emotion is towards her alcoholic friend from whom she draws most of her dysfunctional support and surprisingly even more more vulnerable than her. She probably trusts him the most because he would never hurt or betray her, unlike almost everyone in her family-her mother, her work supervisor, her house mates. The whole world has already hurt her and she just plods through life. Even with its undertone of sexual fantasy it is really about human emotions and the damage one goes through and coping with life, her various menial jobs, the sex jobs she gets tells of stories how many people go through life uncaring of what happens to them once they have been damaged by life. The old men are there playing out their wildest fantasies with this young nymph, ironically, she is so close to them and they can touch her physically but she is still physically and emotionally detached. the first guy is more tender, the 2nd guy is aggressive and kinky and the 3rd had fantasies of carrying her away like a young prince, each old man is pathetic in their own ways representing the struggles people have to face in life even while they are drugged in their own sad little worlds it shows how humans at their most frail are most vulnerable to the dark side of life represented by these old men looking for whatever fantasy their money might buy; in reality same is true in real life those who are hard on their luck go through dark phases trying all sorts of activities illegal or what not to make it through life often times not going unscathed.It explains why that cashier at checkout is always so glum, or the ticket lady couldn't care less about you; Lucy depicts that in all of us when we are hard on our luck and could not care less. It is a cold, artistic and very dark movie, not the movie for everyone but if you like thinking movies it's compelling and makes you think. While she seems emotionally detached and superficially you feel like you cannot connect, there is a little bit of dark side in each of us when life kicks you in the butt and you couldn't careless about anything and feel like wallowing woe is me, it teaches us about the depth of human spirit; in the end there is some triumph, she is curious as to what happens to her giving her some semblance of actually caring about what happens to herself, but the final message is so subtle you have to look hard for it; if you are open minded and like a depth and subtle powerful acting you will enjoy this movie if you go for obvious in-your face entertainment this movie is not for you.",Sleeping Beauty

71,louisstucki,Excellent movie,9,5 February 2015,"This is an excellent but also mysterious movie. We never get to know the reason why Lucy (Emily Browning) offers herself naked to other men, it is even difficult to say if she's a happy person because she hardly shows any emotions. This reminded me about the movie ""Jeune et Jolie"" with Marine Vacth, a student working as a prostitute who shows as much emotions as Lucy which means almost none. However, Lucy is still a person you can sympathize with because she's very friendly to all peoples and says ""Thank you"" throughout the movie so much as almost no other movie character does (about nine times or more). I would recommend this movie to anybody because it makes you think about what lies beneath Lucy's reserved behavior. I'm glad the script writer didn't show her background completely, so the audience, as Emily Browning (an actress with interesting views by the way) said herself, has to do some thinking.",Sleeping Beauty

Lucy is attending classes at university; volunteering as a research guinea pig with a young male scientist; working extra in a pub with a friendly male boss; going out to a bar with a friend who gives her cocaine before she leaves to f.ck one of the older bar visitors; sharing house with people who constantly complain; resting in her own room; working extra as a photocopier assistant in a big office with an ever controlling female boss; talking to her alcoholic mother on the telephone; visiting her honest, depressed and alcoholic friend who she serves cereal with vodka. However, then she finds a new job as a half-naked waitress, where her vagina will never be penetrated according to her female boss, who encourages her to take drugs as they are ""aspirin for the soul"". In this job she is soon promoted to sleep naked in a big bed, after being put to sleep by sleeping pills, without knowing what is happening to her during the sleep.

I was slightly disappointed with the ending, however there were a lot of very important messages in this film particularly relevant to the world that we live in today.

74,metal-7,"not only a terrible film, it's not even original",2,19 December 2011,"I left the theater after seeing Sleeping Beauty shaking my head. Both my wife and I felt more than a little cheated. It really takes a special kind of bad to make a beautiful girl -- prostrated naked all over the screen for the better part of the movie -- boring and unappealing. And yet, this is precisely what we got from it. Why? The problem seems to be that much of the tension and drama hinges on empathizing with Emily Browning's character, a girl shallow and adrift, yet simultaneously cold to the world. Financial predicaments and dissatisfaction with life make her teen angst blossom into ugliness. The expression ""bored people are boring"" comes to mind.I do not wish to recount plot details beyond what is outlined in the summary, in case you decide to see the film for yourself. However, tonight my wife discovered an earlier film from Germany, which shocked us, having seen Sleeping Beauty so recently. The film is called ""House of the Sleeping Beauties"", directed by Vadim Glowna in 2006, based on Yasunari Kawabata's much older novel. What's peculiar is that House of the Sleeping Beauties is so painfully close to Sleeping Beauty, it's not funny. Virtually every critical plot point is present in both films. And yet, House of the Sleeping Beauties is made from a completely different perspective and strikes a decidedly different tone. It's more nuanced, more three-dimensional, more mysterious. It's... just better. The night we saw Sleeping Beauty, my wife and I agreed that despite all the drawbacks, the premise held something and the film could have been good. House of the Sleeping Beauties is that better film.I sincerely hope that Julia Leigh meant to reference the earlier German work and create an interplay between them. It's an interesting idea. Though, I'm a bit skeptical, seeing as there appears no mention of the other it anywhere in the credits, nor in marketing or writing around Sleeping Beauty itself.",Sleeping Beauty

It tries to make stupid points about things getting a bit weird when you take off your clothes with old man for money. We know this. Most children know this. Why are people paid really well to make films about things so stupid? Pay me and I will put big black sign up in cinema for 1 and a half hour that says don't have sex for money, it bad for you. Story has big bits missing. Probably thinks is artistic but is not. Just annoy really. Is like they shot various scenes and put them on DVD and you make a film out of them for yourself. Meanwhile director makes lots of money from men buying DVD of naked girls and he does nothing. Nice work. So the ending comes... nothing happens. Question posed, what happens all the way though film. Answer is nothing. Director knows we want to know and then doesn't tell us. He thinks is funny but next time he makes film everyone knows he makes rubbish films and not buy it at the market. Artistic people say open to interpret but truth is lazy. Film goes nowhere. Main character is dull. She has no personality so we don't get to like her much. She annoy a bit and does nasty things. She agrees to get drugged so men pay her but they promise not to do anything. They trust them not to do anything with unconscious girl. If not do anything why not sleep with own wife? So film has nice touches. Girl acts well, she has nothing to work with but she makes good try at it. Like actress but not character. Emotional attach to some guy but nothing happens. Nothing ever happens. In one scene she put chair on table. Is relief to see people do something. What scenes there are are nice but not a story. There is no story. It makes moral point. Don't do weird sex things for money. We know this already. Film waste of time. Better ways to make this point and audience have fun too.

76,Maria_Sanchez,The debut feature film by novelist Julia Leigh is anything but artistic,1,29 November 2011,"The debut feature film by novelist Julia Leigh is anything but artistic, which is a goal that she obviously set out to achieve. Sleeping Beauty follows a university student going from one mundane job to another until she eventually settles into a position where she is put into a coma-like state so that old men can fondle her naked body while she lies in bed, lifeless. This interpretation of the classic fairy tale goes beyond provocative, but falls flat due to the lack of purpose of the main protagonist.Lucy, played by Australian actress Emily Browning, is the anti-hero without any redeeming qualities. We first see her in a lab, where she is a subject in an experiment. While she sits there, quiet and static, we see the lab technician begin his experiment by testing her gag reflex as he gently shoves a long tube down her throat until she cannot take anymore. It is unnerving and uncomfortable, which sets the tone for the film.We soon encounter the people in her life, such as her housemates who don't engage with her on a personable level, only on a business level by asking for her rent, and her needing to clean the house (subtle shout out to Cinderella?). Soon we meet Birdmann, a man who lives a small apartment littered with horded possessions, who is supposed to be Lucy's anchor and heart. However, there is something off about their relationship. While she makes him a bowl of cereal (with vodka instead of milk) their interaction is stagnant and to an extent, pointless. Who is this man? How do they know each other? Why doesn't she live with him? Too many questions rise from this relationship, but we are never let in as we are always kept at arm's length from discovering who the characters really are.Tiresomely, the film goes on and Lucy answers an ad for high-end 'waitressing' for extra cash so she can make rent. This leads to an interview of scrutinous proportions, as she is poked and prodded and intimately examined by the Madame, played by Rachael Blake. She is soon hired, starting her journey as a high-end escort.Her first gig is to serve a handful of elderly men (and one woman who is Benita from Play School, my childhood is now shattered!!) in a lavish mansion, wearing revealing white lingerie, whilst the other girls wear black (and certainly not sexy as it makes their breast look like baby bottles). The dinner party has somewhat of an Eyes Wide Shut vibe, with the setting and tone, but not as compelling.Lucy falls deeper and deeper into this lifestyle, eventually offering herself to be put into a coma-like state as mentioned earlier. The film tries to show the softer side to these men in an effort to make us understand their desires, however, this creates long, boring monologues which ends in showing us an old mans cock (excuse my French).On a positive note, the film looks beautiful. There was precise precision and technique applied to this film to give it a very European look. The sets, costumes and design is a thing of beauty which does keep you entranced. But by the time the third old mans penis came around, I literally could watch no more. There are not many films that I walk out on because as a critic and movie goer, there is a level of respect you must give the filmmakers. However on this occasion, I was at my last tether.It was the lack of emotion throughout the film which ultimately made it all style without any substance. As much as I wanted to like the film, it was guilty of pretentious overload.",Sleeping Beauty
77,maxiam_us,"Potential to be a Grindhouse Flick, imho",6,3 December 2013,"The main plot begins to take root when Lucy answers an ad from Clara(Rachael Blake). If I squint my eyes and ignore the rest of the film, it would have been a perfect scene from a grindhouse flick; in fact, this is one of the scenes displayed prominently in the trailer. Basically, when Lucy meets Clara, she is told to strip, and, along with Thomas(Eden Falk), her body is inspected for imperfections. She is then told the parameters of the job: she is to participate in silver service in lingerie for wealthy clients. Clara outlines to Lucy that there will be no penetration; Lucy could care less, and even welcomes the opportunity.Fast forward to Lucy entering a plush mansion, where she meets the lead waitress...who tells Lucy that her lipstick has to match...her, er...""special place"". She is soon dressed in skimpy white underwear, serving elderly rich people, along with older, sexy babes in stark black underwear, with their breasts OUT. She earns her first paycheck, and soon, Clara presents an escalation of the present deal: at Clara's private mansion, Lucy will be drugged into a deep slumber, and rich clients will have their way with her.Meanwhile, Birdman, who seems to be suffering from drug use, gets worse. Lucy has three encounters with rich clients, all while naked and vulnerable in slumber. The first man(Peter Carroll) simply wants ""all his bones broken"" and sleeps with her. The second man(Chris Haywood) uses cigarettes in an act of sexual sadism. And the third man(Hugh Keays-Byrne) seems to have watched either WWE or love old adventure serial posters...cause he carries Lucy's slumbering body around the room, and then slams her on the bed.Soon, 'ol Lucy is getting scared, discovering a mark on her body, and begs Clara to tell her what is going on. Clara refuses to share the truth of the encounters, thus prompting Lucy to buy a micro camera, swallow it, regurgitate it before her slumbering session with the first man again, and setting it up to film said encounter. The film ends when a horrified Clara, thinking Lucy is dead, quickly performs CPR to awaken the ""Sleeping Beauty"". Lucy wakes up, looks around, and starts screaming. The reason? I don't know. Yes, the first man is dead besides her, but it does not look like she is screaming in terror. She strikes the bed, which implies anger. So...again...I don't know WHY she is screaming.I will admit, I have a bias towards the beautiful Emily Browning...not to mention, she has GUTS. To bare your whole birthday suit, without batting an eye, and participating seriously in some of the outlandish things Lucy was subjected to in the three encounters says a lot about this young woman. My hat is off to this awesome actress, who doesn't stoop to using body doubles(I'm looking at you, Lohan and Frieda Pinto), but gets out there and shows herself, honestly. And that says how seriously she takes her craft.That being said, the film...my thoughts on it is...as a grindhouse aficionado, I felt that a perfect opportunity was wasted. Judging the film without Browning, on its own merits...it seemed pretentious to me. I know, I know, the filmmakers weren't trying to make it this way, that they had a message to get across...but I missed it. Granted, it wasn't all fanservice...for your shots of Browning and the other beauties in skimpy lingerie, you had the three encounters consisting of a naked and vulnerable Browning with wrinkled, equally naked old men. It definitely was not a have-your-cake-and-eat-it-to moment for yours truly.The film seemed to drag at times as well because of its artsy focus. Before the first encounter with the slumbering Lucy, the First Man launches into a long ramble with Clara about a story of when he was 30 years old, and how he had a book, and how he wants his ""bones broken"". I was laughing because Clara seemed to reflect my thoughts at the time...""what is up with this old man, and can I get on with my life?"" Then, there was Lucy. We don't get to see much about her. She seems to go through life bored, and seems to do the things she does for the hell of it. She does drugs, sleeps with guys left and right, and finally serves as a toy for wealthy old men. Hell, the only time she seems to care about herself is after the second encounter with the sexual sadist, and feeling the cigarette burn left after. Even then, she doesn't do anything until the end. I don't think your audience will find her relatable, just frustratingly one-note.The film is definitely shrug-inducing. It lacks the fun of Sucker Punch, or a defining twist like The Uninvited. I would go so far to say that the ""artsy"" focus was a huge detriment, but that is my very personal view. The reason I say this is that it had the potential to be like a exploitation film...Lucy being trapped in the claws of wealthy elderly guys, who hold her in sexual bondage, and forcing her into sleeping fits. Yeah, I know this isn't for everyone...but this film TEASED so many exploitation elements, it was very frustrating to see that it refused to go all the way.",Sleeping Beauty
78,metratonic,"Yasunari, sorry",2,6 January 2012,"The idea for a non-penetration brothel, a house of sleeping beauties is taken from the short story ""House of sleeping beauties"" (Nemureru Bijo) by Kawabata Yasunari and brought upside down, bowels out and head over heels, keeping only the overly sleepy mood of contemplation (here: self- contemplation). The point of view switches radically from the old man (book) to the sleeping girl (movie). So far, so good. The idea was more than fine, the book - okay, but the movie was a true disappointment. Why, though? First, it lacks a true intrigue. And I'm so sorry to say that the only thing that kept me more or less awake while struggling to watch this, was the sight of Emily Browning more or less naked. Perhaps they told her to act sedated during the whole movie, so that the viewer could see some sense in the title (because in more half the film Lucy, her heroine sells her body in various ways, none of which includes the slightest hint of sleep, but nonetheless her nipples show way more emotion and development than her face). That very same larger half of the movie seems to act like a poor cinematographic justification for prostitution, which sadly is not so cinematographic, even with the eyeswideshuttish scenes of erotic silver service or overly theatrical and profound blackouts between scenes, or even the final frame that serves as an unexpected (yet not unsuspected) ending. The movie is void of character development or a visible concept or anything, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. The book was the same: the contemplation, the sensual but not erotic stuff and the all- pervading impression that human beings are immanently messed up. It's not exactly the inspiration to make you go out of the cinema with pulse over 100 and the strong desire to change your life and the world, but it could have triggered some thoughts and emotions if it weren't for:The dialogue: there were a few lines that worked extremely well (Lucy's first conversation with Birdmann for example, which was a gleam of brilliance) and there were some other good moments, but few worked well enough to help the viewer understand what's happening (if anything at all).The acting: Except for Clara and perhaps Sophie, the rest of the female acting was cut down to a plain showoff of numb young flesh, which might have been intended as creepy and conceptual, but works more like a great bore.The lack of soundtrack: a few tones here and there, to wake the audience? The closeup frames: as badly composed, plain and boring as a closeup can get. And more, and more. Since writing about it is almost as tiresome as watching, here are the few things I actually liked:1.Said Birdmann conversation and a certain strong-spirited muesli. 2. Clara talking to the bearded man. 3. First and third nights as a sleeping beauty.4. Coin-flipping dialogue 5.First frame. 6. Sophie talking with her hair unbound.7. Nipples and lipstick (please, note that I mention nipples again only because I like the number 7)",Sleeping Beauty
79,mwriter-2,** Great premise and potential yet fell short **,5,26 January 2013,"This is a movie that could have been great. I will not repeat the same critiques of others, I appreciate the art and artist for a great gamble, but at bottom I feel it failed to develop the story, give depth to the characters and could not break past the merely unsettling to show us a truly erotic, horror movie. I never felt depth and I did not get enough visually to feel I understood the meaning or message beyond what I put there. In all I feel I was left with too many unanswered questions, thus the film felt underdeveloped As a high point, I felt it had some of the better treatment of nudity I have seen, just enough at seemingly the right moments, but not a substitute for story. It was even shy with it at times, so the nudity was not overtly erotic, indeed it was almost clinical, not a distraction but an actual element to move us forward. I was impressed.All that said, I think it is worth watching for some intriguing visuals, a thought provoking story premise and insight into how horror can have sexuality without ""slasher"" violence as seems the default and actually touch you. I wanted the unsettling, the suspense and the tragedy that seems to have eluded this film. Thus, I think it was a great premise, and it should have been better.",Sleeping Beauty
80,stryders,Wake Up Call,7,27 November 2011,"Wake Up Call Julia Leigh's ""Sleeping Beauty"" has gained a reputation for being erotic, insipid, brave, disappointing, groundbreaking, regressive and a host of other contradictions. It's no wonder. A young woman consents to being drugged for the purpose of complete submission to the sexual whims of an ultra-rich clientèle. At first glance, this plot might appear an invitation to take part in some tawdry voyeurism.For me, the film was an expose about what infantile fantasies secretly motivate the wealthy, power-obsessed male psyche and how nature, the feminine and all that is beautiful is sacrificed to his insatiable appetite.To my knowledge, the nocturnal Beauty that slumbers in the nucleus of this movie never reveals her motivation making herself available to the host of parasitic vermin that covet her porcelain complexion and exquisite figure, but there is an important moment near the mid-point of the story that assures us it is not for the money, as we would assume, and that single episode supercharged my interest the character of Lucy.The scene takes place after a high-end rendezvous when she returns home with an impressive stack of cash which she lays on the coffee table and pauses to gaze at luxuriantly. While hardly taking her eyes off the loot, she opens a small wooden box and takes out what is, presumably, a partially smoked joint, lights it, takes a hit and uses the lighter to burn one of the bills from the top of the stack. This did not come off, for me, as some kind of absurd irony. It takes place at the midpoint of the story precisely because it is meant to upturn all our presumptions about the heroine. It fascinated me and made me want to stick around to see where the story was going.Lucy works at two dead end jobs, one as a waitress where she is always seen cleaning up at closing time, one as an office temp where she is sequestered in a room full of duplicating machines. She also attends classes at college in which she seems to take absolutely zero interest. On top of this, Lucy regularly submits herself to a perplexing lab experiment where she is required to swallow a latex bladder attached to a hose that makes her wretch and gag while the researcher inflates it in her throat. For this she is paid all of thirty bucks and she continues to show up for this clinical ritual even after she has broken into big time sex games with the super-rich. In addition to all this she persists in soliciting flagrantly licentious liaisons with any vulture that happens to circle her bar stool.""My vagina is not a temple"", Lucy replies in direct contradiction to the enigmatic Clara, the exquisitely groomed, garbed and gracious pimp, played by Rachael Blake, who pairs Lucy with her prosperous predators. Contrary to what predators in the audience may conclude, this does not make Lucy complicit in her violation. It implies that the dominant male paradigm has perverted the culture and this young woman is so utterly steeped in its brazen sexism that she has never developed the slightest sense of her sexual self-worth.I'm fairly certain that our disgust at the end of the film was intended by the filmmaker, and possibly some of the negative reviews of ""Sleeping Beauty"" derive from the inability of those reviewers to separate the harsh emotional resonances at the film's conclusion from their own conclusions about the film. In saying this I do not mean to criticize the critics. One cannot argue with one's feelings. Their response is natural and, on one hand, completely understandable, but I kept asking myself during the movie, why is this filmmaker wading into these murky metaphors? She must have anticipated being rewarded by many viewers with resentment and ridicule.I presume the filmmaker is deliberately courting controversy but if I suspected that she was doing so for her own glory, or simply for the sake of pushing buttons, I would go right along with the skeptics. If I am correct about her intentions, the director's position is reactionary–calculated to tweak her audience's moral equilibrium for sure–but it is done so neither as a tease or a joke, so it did not invalidate the movie's importance for me.The most telling event in the story is repeated three times so that we really have a chance to catch on. Every time a date with the latest rich old fart has been set-up, Clara brings him into the room where Lucy slumbers, unconsciousness in bed. ""It's safe here."" Clara assures him. ""No one can see you and there is no shame."" Viola! The power hungry male fantasy is exposed in all its impotent, puerile ingenuity. What is being laid bare in Julia Leigh's ""Sleeping Beauty"" is not the divine body of Emily Browning. It is what all those aging rich dudes reach for as their precious power begins fading. It drives them to claw their way to the top and stoop so low to plunder nature, the dreams of humankind and all things precious and beautiful. They do it for this measly, pathetic, artificial gratification–to claim for their over-nourished egos the privilege of possessing, enslaving, and violating the most cherished things on earth in a place where they imagine no one can see them, punish them or interfere in anyway.I recognize the value of this wake up call, which allows the audience to catch them with their pants down and expose them for what they have really been up to while we sleep.If my assumptions about this film are correct, Sr. Louis Buñeul would be Ms. Julia Leigh's patron saint. In these critical times, in which a doctrine of greed and manipulation of the masses has been cooped from the Popes and retro-fitted into the agendas of the corporate elites, perhaps we should all be more open-minded to transgressive cinema like this.",Sleeping Beauty

On this occasion however I can confidently say that this review will not contain spoilers, mainly because I've no idea what just happened!I like a good art house film, and totally understand storytelling in which ""less is more"". It's nice to be treated with enough respect by a writer/director that I don't have to have everything spelled out for me. But Sleeping Beauty took this to the extreme being giving away virtually nothing.This film consists of a series of seemingly unrelated snippets; Lucy's flatmates, the Birdman, the various temp jobs, and then ultimately the strange/erotic sleeping arrangements which the film is sold on. I've no doubt that the writer and director have something they want to say through this (no one makes a film for no reason and I love art-driven film because that reason tends to be more meaningful that the box office take) However, you can't put a few streaks of paint on a canvas in the style of another great Austrailian artist, and then down tools with ""Can you tell what it is yet?""In some ways you'll find this film even more disappointing because in some ways it's very good. It is so beautifully shot and Emily Browning puts in a good follow-up to Suckerpunch. On this occasion there just isn't enough to bring those bits together into a coherent whole.

83,alecharris2004,Flawed Beauty,6,9 October 2011,"There's a lot to be applauded in the debut feature of Julia Leigh; not least of which the performance of Emily Browning who shows incredible talent and fearlessness in portraying a young woman who cannot connect to the world around her and who, essentially, is sleeping her way through life.There's also a lot to be commended in Leigh's use of single camera, 'open' takes, allowing the actors to stretch into a scene and build emotional resonance over the arc of a scene; the same as theater. - the first scene shot for example was the death of 'birdman'. A scene that is both pivotal and incredibly hard on Browning. And not one you would usually choice for the first day of filming and it's a credit to both Leigh and Browning that it's pitch perfect.Where it falls however, is in Leigh's use of film making. The single shot take is a great acting tool, but a weak and unnecessary editing one. The only two transitions used are seemingly 'cut to' and 'fade to black' and this doesn't help the audience in terms of emotional journey.The use of symbolism, for example - the trail of berries, the open door, the house in the woods - lacks impact due to the single shots employed.The aforementioned death of Birdman scene is transitioned to a mid shot scene of Lucy wiping tables with no visual clues as to why, leaving the incredibly painful, beautifully acted ending somewhat lost on all but the most observant. We may, honestly, understand the ending. We may get the relationship of Lucy & Birdman. We may even accept her choices. But I don't think the film maker has done enough to help us enter the world and personas she has wonderfully.Orson Welles famously tells the tale of his first day as director and being taken aside by the cinematographer who 'taught him everything he needed to know about film making in 12 hours'.What Leigh needed here was a better cinematographer.",Sleeping Beauty

There is no subtext, there is no complexity only pretentious gibberish.

87,OutlawsDeLejos,A challenging and rewarding film experience.,9,30 June 2011,"As the credits came up at the end of Sleeping Beauty the audience reaction was immediate, half chuckled nervously and I heard the word ""What?"" thrown around a bit. The other half stared ahead, absorbing what we'd just seen. It's clear that this will divide audiences.Julia Leigh's directorial debut from her own screenplay follows the emotionally complex character Lucy (Emily Browning), a university student with a multitude of part-time jobs and a social life that can only be described as controversial. It's made clear early on that Lucy has no solid relationships, the only friend she's seen out with her seems more like a madam than a friend, her kinder flatmate is too weak to defend her from her male counter-part, her unseen mother is an abusive alcoholic chasing Lucy for money and her father is either long absent or passed away. There is only 'Birdman', a young man slowly dying from alcoholism cast away from Lucy's ex-boyfriends circle of friends. His company seems to be cathartic for Lucy, an alcoholic that is kind and not abusive like her mother.When Lucy responds to an ad in the University paper for 'Silver Service Waitress' she is introduced to Clara (Rachael Blake), a 'madam' for want of a better word. Rachael Blake's performance is tonally perfect, her Clara is elegant and seemingly disenchanted with her work. When she gives Lucy details of each task she is too perform, it always comes with a warning, each step is explained with an obvious and painful personal knowledge of the job. This sort of work is new for Lucy, it's forces social interaction which she was adept at avoiding in all her other jobs. And it also forces her into a position of submission, not at all something she is used to in her usual role as the dominate sexual partner in her string of empty encounters with middle aged, middle-class businessmen.Lucy's role in the Sleeping Chamber comes across as something akin to a hearthstone where wealthy old men gather to realize or recapture feelings long since lost or denied to them, intimacy, sexual dominance and physical strength are examples of themes her subdued body are exposed to, even in this secret world of control they still fail and it's Lucy that absorbs the cost.Nearly every important scene and transaction in the film is hidden in subtext, Leigh makes the audience work to make the connections and draw conclusions by dropping breadcrumbs and leaving enough for us to see the whole story without having to resort to spoon fed exposition. It makes for an interesting contrast, characters that feel entirely real viewed through cold artistic lens. This approach does present a challenge not only to the filmmakers but the audience, Lucy is very much a curious protagonist. She's cold and reckless, acts on the most childish of impulses in an effort to keep everyone at arms length. It's justifiable though, her family, her friends and her ex have let her down. Even Clara fails to uphold her promise to protect her from violation. Emily Browning is a powerful force in the film, finding the perfect balance of a young woman struggling to hold her wall up against the world, but giving us enough to glimpse a real person underneath the cracks through something as subtle as the softening of her eyes. She shows an extreme level of dedication to the role, not only adhering to the required nudity, but also the context of those scenes, it becomes very intense viewing. Don't expect titillation to be found anywhere here, the uncovered flesh is a tool of contrast. Despite the ethereal beauty Emily Browning commands on screen, there is nothing sexy about what you see. But in the end, I found her to still be a real person, I sympathized and indeed felt for her.Sleeping Beauty is much like the blooming of a flower, all the petals open slowly in unison, not one at a time, it isn't until it's finished can we admire it in it's entirety. And there is a lot to admire here if you go in with an open mind, look past the stylized exterior and delve underneath. 9/10",Sleeping Beauty

THE MOVIE WAS MEANINGLESS, it made me angry that I've spent 90 min on it. so many unfinished stories in that movie, sex scene were disgusting. and the plot was stupid. a lot of awkward scenes that did not add anything to the story. and the ending was weird and unsatisfying. leaving you wondering what the hell were they thinking. there isn't much to add but don't watch it. unless you would like to see Emily because she was gorgeous. and this last line is just to reach the minimum amount of lines to be accepted.",Sleeping Beauty

90,bruno_bracco,"Disturbing, but thought-provoking",9,13 November 2011,"Sleeping Beauty is one of those movies not easy at all to be understood. One has to try to read between the lines, then it can start to make sense. And, when it does, we have to admit that, although surely disturbing, it has a lot to say.At a certain point of the story, an old man says he was never really able to see the true beauty of his wife. And the whole plot is developed around this main idea: mankind - including women - seems to be ultimately unable to see the beauty of true femininity. At least in our western, parental-guided society.None of the scenes is unnecessary. All of them show a different aspect of women submission - sometimes forced by men who eager to objectify women in order to taste a utterly depressing pleasure, sometimes caused by women themselves. But there's no one to blame other than mankind as a whole.The movie made me think about the reasons that may have leaded men to historically depreciate women, and a great fear, I reckon, might have been the main one. But regardless of the reasons, the film asks each one of us if this is the path we want to keep walking on. We might have a chance to change, while ""our bones are not broken"". Not for long, though. And, if we don't manage to wake up and begin to see the infinite beauty that lies within every man and every woman, there shall be no salvation but death - death to which our profound sleep in our meaningless lives is already taking us.",Sleeping Beauty
91,noiamwiki,Life as Death as Sex as Sleep,8,1 May 2021,"Forget the sex. Leigh has made a finely crafted, superbly acted film about life as a living death. The sex is lifeless because it is a symbol for the lifelessness of life. The actors perform drably because they are intended to be deathly. Sleep and death are the true linchpins of the film, across the characters, and Lucy is their avatar.LIFE AS DEATH, BEGGING LIFE
Browning's acting is frigid because her character is intended to be barely alive. Lucy seems to be encased in a layer of ice she cannot break through to connect with people. But she needs to connect with people to live and she wants to be given some living to do, so she battles her apathy and the best she can do is to coldly control the ways that she surrenders herself to others. She controls how she lets go of control, for example, directing the coin toss in the bar, the rituals with Birdman, the decisive drug taking, the rapid seductions, the marriage ""proposals"", and of course the job itself in every way. She seems to take these risks partially because she doesn't care what happens to her, but also because she is begging life to show her what matters. She knows for a moment what matters when Birdman suicides. She has done little to prevent it, but her ice breaks for a moment and grief and helplessness convulse from her. At last she is touched by life, through death, but that very death serves to reinforce her disconnect from life. Life, for Lucy, still may as well be death. She sleeps through her days and is paid to do it. She acts like a robot doll whether or not she is paid to do it. She burns money, she gets the most expensive apartment in town, pushing the edges to see what makes her heart beat, just once.LIFE AS DEATH AS SEX: INACCESSIBLE LIFE
In fact, all of the main characters in the film are living a deathly life. Birdman, Clara and the old men who come to see her, are all similarly grasping for the last straws of life out of their frigid, frustrated, empty existences. They ironically use Lucy to reach for those straws: the verdant young woman can surely reinvigorate life. But she, too, is lifeless in her sleep and even in her waking, and totally unavailable sexually despite the promising image.LIFE AS DEATH AS SEX AS SLEEP
Leigh reinforces the disturbing quadtratic equation of death, life, sex and sleep in the final scene, where a wealthy man similarly disconnected from life who has earlier declared he did not cherish his wife or children, etc, and that this has ""broken all his bones"", gets Clara to help him suicide. He once again approaches the inaccessible life and sex (Lucy's nubile body encased in rules), and responds to it by making his own death, under the guise of sleep. The man dies beside Lucy, peaceful beneath the sheets of the bed, just as Birdman did. Indeed, this is the moment when the quadratic pattern is revealed, as we are confronted with the similarities to Lucy's complicity in Birdman's death. She aids his death through her apathetic actions, while their entire relationship is underpinned by a sexual dimension that seems inaccessible to them and is highlighted by Birdman's dying request for her to remove her top. Birdman suicides, presumably, by a sleeping pill overdose. We witness the duplicated union of death, life, sex and sleep. In culmination of these united themes, Lucy herself almost dies due to her total disregard for life and sexuality. From her near-death sleep, she awakens into violent horror at the realisation of the death ever present, within herself and without: the dead man in the bed, the recent death of Birdman and the living death of Clara. The final image leaves us with a man and a woman in bed, and it is indiscernible whether they are sleeping or dead.What more do you need? Julia Leigh's ""Sleeping Beauty"" is not about sex. It is about living death.",Sleeping Beauty
92,angel-with-a_filthysoul,Absolutely Beautiful if you are a film lover!,10,29 June 2011,A lot of people will not like this film due to it not being mainstream. It is open to interpretation and closed minded people will not understand it. Emily Browning is gorgeous and well cast. This film reminded me a lot of Stanley Kubrick's films as they are both beautifully shot and nudity is art rather then sexual. This is the direction Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland should have gone as it is a very dark and erotic tale of Sleeping Beauty and it is Australian! This film has a lot of hidden messages to girls in the sex industry. She is not a prostitute but is willing to go to far lengths for money. She reminded me of a stripper but it was not enough and has to go to far ends to earn money. I advise you to go see it and support Australian Cinema and watch it with an open mind!

95,grouchyeditor,Fantasy Time for Dirty Old Men,5,8 February 2012,"I like my movies odd, and I like my movies sexy. In general, when I review an odd, sexy movie, I want to be kind because I don't want filmmakers to stop making them. But there is a limit – and freshman director Julia Leigh's ""Sleeping Beauty"" is long on odd and short on sexy.""Sleeping Beauty"" is about a young woman named Lucy (Emily Browning) who is psychologically damaged. In fact, everyone Lucy encounters – an old boyfriend, co-workers at a temp job, the landlords with whom she lives – is damaged in one way or another: hostile, bitter, emotionally impenetrable. So Lucy, who is nothing if not experimental, takes a new job as a living blow-up doll for rich old men to play with (but never to ""penetrate,"" as we are constantly reminded by the madam of the high-end brothel for which Lucy works).Leigh's movie is basically a 100-minute peep show in which we observe Lucy and her peculiar acquaintances. It's an Australian production with French art-film pretensions; when someone pours a glass of tea or wipes down a tabletop, Leigh's camera lingers portentously. There is much unspoken angst in the film – but not to worry, because all of this somber silence will soon be broken by some kinky sex.If I didn't know better (actually, I guess I don't), I'd wager that ""Sleeping Beauty"" was produced by a committee of dirty old men, several of whom get to appear in scenes with the fetching, young Browning. How else to explain numerous scenes in which these geezers, their twigs-and-berries on full display, spoon with the naked and unconscious girl, or mount her sleeping (drugged) body, or toss her recklessly onto the floor?""Sleeping Beauty"" is promoted as an ""erotic drama,"" but while watching it I found myself empathizing with one of Lucy's customers, who complains: ""The only way I can get a hard-on these days is if I swallow a truckload of Viagra.""",Sleeping Beauty

I cared nothing about what happened to anyone in the film, few of the scenes led to anything of meaning or interest (a small example: as Lucy is waiting to get in a lift, a group of students is seen nearby, and the presumed occupant of the flat they were previously in darts out to return something to one of the group; this has nothing to do with anything in the film, and appears to serve no purpose whatever). The film lacks any emotional content, and seems to serve no purpose and answer no questions.This film might remind some of Kubrick's film Eyes Wide Shut, but that film is far superior in every respect.",Sleeping Beauty

Difficult is the best word.",8,26 January 2013,"Well, I copy the plot of another review because it is not what interests me to write, but like that you will know of what Im speaking.Plot: ""Lucy (Emily Browning) is a student working on a number of jobs. She's a waitress, she works in an office and she's involved with a science experiment at her university too. She's not co-operating with her house-mates though and the rent is overdue. When she sees an ad in the paper she applies for it. She's driven to a manor house where she meets Clara (Rachael Blake). Clara describes the job, which involves Lucy being sedated in a bed and allowing men to watch her sleep. Lucy is assured that she will not be penetrated. Her first task with several other women is to serve a group of old men dinner at the manor house. After this she is put in a deep sleep and studied individually by three different men. Outside her job, one of Lucy's few relationships is with an old friend of hers called Birdmann (Ewen Leslie), an alcoholic."" (Marmaduke90)First: Birdman. Well, is dying from alcohol addiction, actually he dies eventually. The relationship between him and Lucy is unclear. Birdman has nothing interesting, so, why Lucy cares for him? Well, i think that this has to do with Lucy's mother being an alcoholic to. I believe that is in fact what attracts Lucy to Birdman. In the final scene of Birdman with Lucy his really sick, and we can see Lucy very distress. But after we find out that she never visit to him again, and two months later his dead. Why she did not come back to visit him? I think is three reasons: 1- because he took advantage of his illness with her, make her undressing and who knows what else; and under the movie we see her reject that kind of relationship with Birdman several times. 2- because he's dying, and she seems to have a problem with death. 3- because he's dying, and she does not want to see him suffer.Second: Why she doesn't have any money? With several jobs and everything... Well, surely she has debts. We know that his mother calls to ask his credit card number, and she know the data from memory, so we can assume that this happens often.Third: the end. Well, let's see: Lucy doesn't seem to care much about nothing, is a passive-aggressive, and a self-destructive girl. I will take a risk with this: I think the end of the movie is a way to make her awake, in fact I think is the best part of the movie, the moment when the title (and all the metaphor with his new work) finally makes sense and also his way of being. The man (a client) who committed suicide, had a very long scene before, a monologue, in which tells us a story. This man has a problem similar to Lucy: he doesn't feel nothing, never did, and he realizes at the moment he read that story. In this story there is a man trying to find himself, a man who has lost the meaning of life, but having a car accident, where the other passenger is killed, and he only injured herself, he ""awakens"" from his ""spiritual torpor"" and can again enjoy his life. Now, the man can not get this to happen to him, so he kills himself: sleeping to death next to Lucy. But she wakes up (for a moment we think that she's dead to), and she react with tears and shouts to the situation in which it is. I think she REALLY WAKES UP. It's only an idea, but works for me.",Sleeping Beauty
98,micropotato,one of those artsy films that leaves you with a weird empty feeling,6,19 December 2011,"Gawd. This is a troubling movie. The role of Lucy is very well selected. I doubt anyone buy Browning can portray this part as well as she did. Her face, body and everything fit perfectly with the role. The movie is very quiet. No music, little dialogues. It wouldn't be unfair to say it's a compilation of pretty pictures (and some that aren't). The movie reminds me a lot of ""Eyes Wide Shut"" played by Nicole Kidman earlier and have the same erotic feel to it. A lot of nudity and sex violence though there wasn't technically any sex. The movie has little character development and little plot as a lot of others pointed out. But the story do have a mystique air to it. Throughout the movie, Lucy is contained and rarely show much emotions. From Lucy's being bored with her life to wanting to know what is happening to her during her ""part-time job"" to finally knowing what happened and screamed and exploded into emotions. All in all, I think this is one of those artsy films that leaves you with a weird empty feeling. Interesting film but quite uncomfortable.",Sleeping Beauty

In reality I found this movie disjointed, with multiple disconnected unnecessary scenes linked together making an already long movie so long it felt like it might have actually slowed down time to the point where it might have stopped.It seems that the director only had two entertainment tools – sex and nudity and there was a constant battle to try and lure the viewer in by showing one or the other or both.

The plot serves little more than to confuse the audience, as only Julia Leigh and her closest friends may have any deeper meaning behind it. There are countless unnecessary shots trying to highlight Lucy's oblivious, emotionless state of the world around her. None more funnier than the 'idiot laying on the floor' shot, which coincidentally had a deeper meaning of an 'idiot laying on the floor.'However, the most enthralling and gripping scene came when we first see Lucy lay motionless in the bed with two people proceeding to come and sit on the end of her bed. An old man tries to tell a deep long winded story, justifying why he does this, but ultimately tells the audience that he is impotent. The film offers little more than 90 minutes of head scratching, plot puzzling and ultimately checking your phone to see if anyone else can offer you any real form escapism The film gets two stars, partly down to Emily Brownings' contribution to acting after being violently licked by an old man, who had a tongue like half dead bison.",Sleeping Beauty
101,daleth-74309,struggled to hard to have depth and artistry,5,26 October 2015,"To be honest one of the only good things about this movie was the nude scenes of Emily Browning. The only message I really got was that she would do anything for money. Was this a typical feminist movie? Or not feminist at all or a little of both. There was the typical all men are useless or evil. On the other hand it was not feminist , in that it displayed the darkest side of women, when there nesting instinct goes to far, where as men generally lust for power, sex and status, women generally lust for security, money and material things. It just seemed to be a long winded repetition of this theme, overdone with meaningless obscurity and lucid dreaminess. Is she a victim or her own worst enemy and why does she also treat everyone else in her life with such disdain and irresponsibility. I had a hard time feeling sorry for her as she seemed to be to passive.

Not really if you judge her by superficial standards. Or maybe its because the writers and actors figured that ""Hey, who gives a crap? Why even give our 60% when the word ""Art"" will take care of it all?"" Honestly, I believe the director is to blame. Also, Emily. Sex and violence sell...this movie has none.

105,shallowphil,Written by Julia Leigh? What about Yasunari Kawabata?,8,17 February 2012,"Little bit of spoilerism...I really enjoyed the feel of this film but a nagging doubt was in the back of my mind, because it reminded me of something else. The pacing and the overall feel is very Japanese, particularly those writers from the post-Edo period, who worked in the 30's and 40's and who pined for the old values... Then the title of a book I saw yesterday grabbed me...This central premise of this film - a girl is placed in a deep sleep so that impotent old men can ogle and touch her - is heavily based upon a short story by Yasunari Kawabata called House Of The Sleeping Beauties, written in 1961. Kawabata is not credited in the end-titles. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1968 and died in 1972.Leigh is playing with this information, obviously thinking of it as a hipsterish in-joke of the ""you've probably never heard of it..."" type. There are other references to works by Kawabata, such as the lecture about a game of Go. Kawabata wrote a novel called The Master Of Go in 1933 and it pretty covers the question by the lecturer in that scene. The whisking of the sleeping potion refers to the Japanese tea ceremony, a detailed description of which also occurs in one of Kawabata's stories (maybe Master of Go, I can't remember). It is a pity she didn't acknowledge her dues to this excellent Japanese writer as awareness of his works out of Japan, while relatively substantial, is certainly not mainstream.

And what about that very last scene that takes ages? What's the purpose of that? I just don't get it.

(Also apparent that she's taking the p-ss.) The other scenes are to set up the idea that none of the things she is engaged with in her life --work, school, family --really matter much to her, and that she's pretty much direction less. Also that she needs to work hard to get by, which should be obvious enough. It establishes enough drudgery to explain why she might be attracted to the danger and risk-taking she embarks on.""Lets not start in on why she burns the hundred dollar note in sustained shot, like the opening with white coat shoving a tube down her throat.""The first is to show her reaction to having some money --as someone who had to struggle for it for so long, she enjoys the sheer pleasure of acting out the idea of having ""money to burn"". The lab tests, meanwhile, are to show you how desperate she is to pick up some cash through odd jobs -- it also sets up the irony of her being ""penetrated"" in her straight job, while not being penetrated in her sleeping call girl one.""As for the performers, our sympathy for the actors' humiliation overrides any criticism of their performances.""Browning did an excellent job, and certainly better than anyone had a right to expect after ""Sucker Punch"". I hear over and over about what a ""blank"" she was; I did not find that to be the case at all: nearly every scene plays out on her face and reactions, and I was constantly following her closely for clues as to where her character was coming from. And yes, there were plenty. As for the nudity, this emphasizes her character's vulnerability, especially when contrasted with her clients. The key moment here is when she finds, after starting her ""sleeping beauty"" job, that she's no longer comfortable sleeping naked at home, and puts on some undies. What her eyes don't remember from her sleeping sessions, it seems her body memory does. Like the above review suggests, there are a lot of opinions out there about how opaque the film is supposed to be; that's not true at all. The film does leave some gaps for your imagination, and it tends to make you focus on detail and draw your own conclusions --everything isn't spelled out in neat little packets of dialog, as some seem to wish for. (""I'm prostituting myself because my daddy didn't love me when I was young and my mother's an alcoholic."" -- I suppose that would be the American version.) This is hardly ""Inland Empire"", though, and the plot dots are certainly there to be connected for anyone who's looking.

108,q_annie,We are living in a dark age,3,26 May 2013,"If I didn't knew what the human nature is capable of, I would be amazed by this movie. If I thought there could possibly be a 'hidden meaning' in this, I would be thinking about it, rather than writing this review. Plato once was wondering over the nature of this mysterious universe and over the nature of God, he decided that when the light feared its absolute existence, darkness came into being. Darkness, hence, never really existed until its existence was given a meaning by the light. That was what Plato thought and later his student, Aristotle, became teacher of Alexander the Great. Subconscious is more powerful and active than its opposite, if saying few words to a sleeping person can change his entire outlook of life, then watching a movie, like watching a dream, can make you change the outlook of your life. If this movie is intended for any other purpose than to justify Hollywood that is turning into a porn and sex industry, or to justify the worlds largest prostitution chain that exists in America, I don't believe in that purpose. If physical needs are a 'mysterious hidden world of unspoken desires', then this hidden world is but creation of our own idea of powerlessness regarding such needs. Just like darkness was nothing but a thought of light.

One can clearly see she has grown up and started taking responsibility, this movie really shows a new side of the Australian actress.This movie is an endless story about young girl Lucy and her path through struggle, or just the ordinary day. She is clearly a troubled girl as you can see the director clearly have showed up. No background story needed, this is not a story about Lucy herself, more about ones collage. She wakes up, takes classes, work 3 different jobs and then ends her day as miserable as the previous. Lucy don't mind, being gentle and average she does not care less about a future. Thus she lives for today. When the new job offer strikes her, she is more than pleased, but she never really know what goes on in the room while sleeping. One can never really figure out the curiosity of Lucy as she never reveals herself. If you want a story that is settled in front of you, look away. In the end, I was as charmed as I was in the beginning. Emily is flawless and haunting in this role, it's provocative, and disturbing. I myself see this movie not only as a big screen fascination but also as a collection of art. The director is very careful with not putting too much details, you're there to figure out them yourself.Many questions left a mark on me after wards, I'm not in need to figure them out, it's perfection for me, to not always know everything.

110,daninpaddington,Worst film I have ever see in a cinema!,1,23 June 2011,"I say that, because it reminds me of a student film made by someone with more money than talent... but I can't just blame it all on the director - the acting was appalling, the script seemed like a great idea but lost the plot in what must have been thought of as 'art'! Surely, even a good composer might have been able to add something to this film, but they didn't even give them a chance! Having said that, the cinematography and lighting are quite good... in fact, a couple shots were mesmerizing (but I am afraid of spoiling anything by saying which ones I thought were :) Also, the make-up was excellent and the wardrobe worked well, as did location scouting (for the most part), but the acting was truly the weakest point of the film – in the end, no one in the theatre gave a stuff what happened to any of them – the audience laughed when the film ended! I give the director credit for trying, and truly welcome their next effort, just please, don't insult the audience next time...Stay away! You won't even been able to sleep through this movie - much as you will want to!!!",Sleeping Beauty
111,butcherkelvin,"pretentious, moi?",3,30 January 2012,"Even David Lynch and Kubrick at his worst would have blanched with embarrassment and thought twice before committing this pretentious tripe to celluloid. So bad I was sure it was directed by Paul Cox. There is more drama and eroticism in the flicker of Emily Browning's eye lid than in this entire film. There are moments of visual splendor (mainly when the camera lingers on Browning) but then a character spoils it all by mouthing sub-Pinter profundities. It's as if it was put together from scraps of Eyes Wide Shut and Mulholland Drive, scraped up off the cutting room floor or found in some long forgotten waste paper basket. Further evidence (if it were needed) that a first time director should avoid directing their own script.",Sleeping Beauty
112,casioshaman,Intriguing and portrayed without unnecessary construct,8,14 March 2012,"As a prerequisite there is no doubt that modern viewers are not accustomed to films such as these, the long shots (which in many cases constitute entire scenes), the extraneous anecdotes, the lack of clarity. And of course the overt sexual deviancy of four or five lecherous old men, who share a striking resemblance to the panel of fascists in Pasolini's 'Salo: 120 days of Sodom'. However I consider this ambiguity to enhance the symbolism of what is shown, who are her seemingly anonymous friends? What does she wish to achieve by prostituting herself? The incessant jumping about to various locations assists the notion of a girl lost in a world which doesn't want her and is intent on glorifying wayward perceptions of beauty. The acting is by no means dramatised, it is how a girl in her position would act believably, it isn't glossed over with attempts at artificial inseminating emotion into the film. With similar intentions of realism the other characters enter (and reappear) with their own endeavours which are not tied in with the mechanics of the plot, (they each live their own story separately). This serves to intensify a severe sense of isolation for Lucy. But apart from this, quirky elements which go unexplained appeal to me as a viewer, why pour vodka on cereal? Why does Clara mention that drugs are ""aspirin for the soul"" (which in fact I agree). The ironic thing is that if director Julia Leigh were to have taken out all the peculiar and ambiguous elements the film would have obtained a better rating. It seems audiences are too conditioned to formula and an exactness of meaning. This makes sense after noticing the vitriolic comments written on a film which I thought was not just insightful and enigmatic, but heroically decided to dispense with unnecessary construction in order to leave a bit of the interpretation up to the viewer.",Sleeping Beauty
113,bwickens84,i don't think i get Australian films!,1,3 November 2011,"This is by far the worst film i have ever seen!! The fade-outs are far too long there are scenes that are completely pointless the only thing that this movie has going for it is the unnecessary amount of nudity. But to be fair i would not expect anything less from an Australian film! The maids outfits were by far non-flattering, the storyline was more than confusing if not non-existent, i honestly have no idea what that film was about the end was beyond pointless and everything in-between was unnecessary. Don't get me wrong the acting was very good but the direction, screenplay and editing i feel was terrible. I personally would class this as more of a soft core porn with a story that could have been far better than it is, but everyone is allowed their own opinion!",Sleeping Beauty
114,RedPanda_1,A really big disappointment,3,29 November 2011,"This film is beautifully shot. Some of the composition is great, and in many ways reminiscent of 'Eyes Wide shut' or 'lost in translation'. I think they were aiming for a similar poignancy and atmosphere, and in the first half an hour of the film you may think that's on the cards.Unfortunately the acting of many of the supporting cast is simply wooden. There is very little character development; many characters which seem to have a significance simply aren't put in any kind of context. What little there is of a plot is contrived and simplistic.The film ends without making any kind of point at all. It even misses the chance to say something about how ""Lucy's"" amoral and oddly repressed life might change as a result of this bizarre story. A great shame. It looked so promising early on, but despite a few moments of hauntingly sinister eroticism and beautiful composition, it felt simple like and evening wasted! Unless your studying cinema as part of an art course, I'd suggest you avoid this film.",Sleeping Beauty
115,apunchhtc,"Poor writing, Poor direction",4,3 January 2012,"As a parent I hope my children never stumble upon this movie. Not due to the unusual prostitution on show in his movie - I do not want my children to be exposed to such poor writing and poor directing.The pinnacle of the poor writing was the pivotal scene where Lucy (Browning) meets the madam, Clara (Blake). Blandly repeating ""your vagina is a temple"" is not writing.The acting was wooden, despite having some great actors. I suspect this was due to the aforementioned poor writing and direction. By the end of the film I was so detached from the characters I hoped that something bad would happen to them.Also at numerous points of the film my concentration was jolted out of the movie by the pointless and repetitive dialogue. In fact when one character required first aid at the end of the movie, I was paying more attention to the fact that the so-called ""first aid"" was wrong and overjoyed that something bad had happened to that character - rather than any empathy for the character themselves.The only character who I felt any connection with was the host of the dinner party / the last suitor - and he was only on-screen for 5 minutes.",Sleeping Beauty
116,deeper_blue,Beautiful but soulless,5,23 August 2013,"I must say this movie is an attempt at art that fails on a big scale. As far as I know, great art is not just about beauty. It is also about being able to evoke strong emotions in the viewers. In this case, the movie succeeds at nothing but bringing us repulsiveness. The protagonist is a beauty but also brainless and apathetic. Even as a female, I'm amazed by her flawless beauty. However, what's the point of being beautiful without a soul? You're nothing but a doll. And worse, she's a sleeping doll, only to be played by creepy old rich men.In terms of a modern interpretation of the classic fairy tale, the movie fails even more terribly. In the original story, the princess slept a peaceful sleep and was eventually awoken by a charming prince. She was of course very passive. She did nothing but sleep and wait for her prince. However, in our modern day story, during the princess's sleep, her naked body is used/abused/played with by ugly saggy old men. So she's not just passive. She was physically abused without even aware of it. And that's supposed to be the screen writer's message about the fate of modern women? After thousands of years of civilization and progress, women still are nothing but passive sex toys? I'm confused. what a shame this movie is directed by a female director.",Sleeping Beauty
117,andrewtwilcock,A dreary poorly directed film with so much potential,1,23 December 2012,"I have seen enough of these types of films. That was about thirty years ago. The direction is so amateurish it harks back to almost thirty years, and I don't get the feeling that is deliberate. I get the art, I get the mood, I get the message, but the packaging is so bland, so awful, it spoilt what could have been such a good film. The bland nature of this film comes from a complete lack of creativity on the part of the direction crew. Camera techniques that are more like a school drama class filming for the first time, lighting that is done over and over again. Say what you will about the subtle veneers in the storyline, but they just don't translate in an meaningful way. And what's with the same camera position on the old man recounting a really boring story he had once read. Please use some imagination. This is either a case of someone being lazy, or someone being so self indulgent that they forgot they have an audience.",Sleeping Beauty
118,joseluisuman,Full frontal nudity but no sex,10,21 September 2013,"Emily Browning shows herself full frontal nude but in no sexual act. She has an astounding body eventually shes thin. Doesn't matter, shes one of the most beautiful Young actresses in Hollywood and i hope to see her nude again. This movie is so confused with a very confusing plot. Meanwhile shes asleep, other mens realizes his dreams with her body. Contempling her beautiful body and doing anything their sick minds let them do. Like liking her, touching even her intimate parts and weird things like lifting up her and putting a cigar in the back on her ear letting burning marks. When shes dress in White lingerie, well her lingerie was very well selected according to the costume designer in this film. Definitively one of the best erotic movies that i ever seen with a twisted ending who left us...wondering and surprised. A college student in day, a prostitute at night, and even alternate Works like in an office at day and waitress at night. Sydney is a pretty cute city to visit.",Sleeping Beauty
119,nancyaliedel,A Fascinating Look at a Disturbed Life,8,12 February 2014,"I will reiterate what another reviewer has said, this movie is not for everyone. It has an erotic undertone, but not in a way that I found erotic. Rather, it was disdainful, disturbing, and made me think. So much so, that I sussed it out here after I watched it. The last scene was not clear to me. That it was the film of the man dying as, ""Sarah,"" lay sleeping next to him. I was not sure if she had been further drugged, or was watching the video she had made. I was confused by that plot point because if the man had died while she was in bed with him, they would not have left her alone to retrieve the camera. It ended in a magical way that I find lacking in most writing. I do understand why she did not help her friend to die. Obviously mentally ill, without help, or care besides her, he was miserable and made a choice. By the time she reached him he could not have been save. That, at least, is what I surmised. This is not a date movie. It is not rated badly and it is not about eroticism. It is the view of the world of one human and the choices she makes. We see the story through her viewpoint. We are not supposed to understand it all. It is a pull-back of a curtain on her life and a bit about who she is, but I did not feel I knew her, nor cared, or did not care about her as I would anyone I do not know well. I am not moved to pity, nor empathy, nor hatred, nor grace by this movie. Yet, it has defined me in a way that will not shake off. I watched without previews and no expectations. I allowed it to lead me where it would and I ended up on a road I neither expected to walk, nor would have sought out, but enlightened nonetheless. Yes, I am using my best, ""adult,"" voice. It is a very adult movie and about endings and how we deal with them. Not beginnings. There is no joy. Sorrow is muffled. I found the scene with the larger man carrying her to be far more disturbing than the scene where she was injured. It stands alone in my book of movies I will not forget, but I also will not revisit. Once down that road, I have seen it and do not wish to return.Nancy",Sleeping Beauty
120,slowcomb,Worst movie ever rented!,1,4 April 2016,"Sleeping Beauty 2011 is a disgrace to the name and Mr.Disney would roll over in his grave in revolt!! I've never seen such a disjointed pile of awful in my life. There is no plot, there is no point. I kept asking myself, what is the point? This movie was a waste of money. It is stated NR for no rating- it should be X or at least R. It is that bad. What has this got to do with sleeping beauty? It does not follow the expected premise at all. Where is the prince? A different name should have been chosen for this movie and it's rating should reflect that it is absolutely not for children!I rented this from a Family Video. This is definitely NOT a family movie. It is by far the worst movie I have ever rented.",Sleeping Beauty
121,ejsha_gebadi,Could have had more potential,3,8 April 2021,"Spoiler alertThe acting was very good and the story line. However, there are alot of missing pieces to the puzzle that leave you confused. For example why didn't she call an ambulance when Birdmann o.d on the pain killers, why didn't she engage romantically with him but deeply cared about him and otherwise picked up strangers from a bar and sleep with them? Why is it puzzling and confusing what is actually wrong with Birdmann that he was an alcoholic yet she brought him booze ? Otherwise made suggestions for a detox? It was a very obscure film that left you puzzled.",Sleeping Beauty
