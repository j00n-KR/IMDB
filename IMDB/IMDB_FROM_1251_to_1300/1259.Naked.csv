0,SnoopyStyle,crackling dialog and amazing performances in unforgettable roles,9,6 May 2015,"Johnny (David Thewlis) has rough sex and accused of rape. He drives off to escape from her family. He leaves Manchester for London where he tracks down old girlfriend Louise Clancy (Lesley Sharp) who lives with Sophie (Katrin Cartlidge) and Sandra who's away on holiday. Johnny gets crazy with Louise and walks away into the streets. He encounters Archie who keeps yelling out ""Maggie!"" and Maggie. He has a philosophical discussion with night security guard Brian. He goes over to the distraught drunk across the street. He becomes taken with Cafe Girl (Gina McKee). He gets beaten by random thugs and stumble back to the flat. The movie also follows the rich psychopathic womanizer Sebastian Hawks aka Jeremy Smart who claims to be the landlord of the girls' flat.This is Mike Leigh at his most aggressively strikingly brutal. The characters are all naked. They are bare and raw. The rapid dialog is exhilarating. David Thewlis creates an insanely memorable character. All the main characters are sharply brilliant. Even the side characters are unforgettable. Who can really forget about ""MAGGIE!""? The security guard is one of my favorites. I also love the harp music. This is shocking and hilarious and a magnificent movie about unforgettable characters.",Naked
1,classicsoncall,"""I've got an infinite number of places to go, the problem is where to stay.""",8,26 June 2018,"Movies like this don't appeal to me on the surface level. Principal characters with a negative attitude and quarrelsome disposition are an immediate turn-off. But Johnny (David Thewlis) is a train wreck in motion and it's hard to avert one's attention from his intelligent dialog, difficult to separate from the idea that he's a social misfit of the first order. Director Mike Leigh makes this film a statement about homelessness, urban alienation, sexual violence and drug abuse, and does so in a masterful way as Johnny makes his way amid a London underbelly on the verge of disintegration. The picture offers any number of derelict characters, and the one that transfixed me the most was that whiplash-head guy who looked like he might have just stepped off a Saturday Night Live set. He would have been right at home with someone like Massive Head Wound Harry. For all his dysfunctional behavior, it was the paper hanger guy who eventually got around to doing what I would have liked to do to Johnny myself, and for a film and an actor to elicit that kind of reaction, it has to be firing on all cylinders. Not for the faint hearted, but if you're having a bad day, this is the kind of picture that might actually lift your spirits.",Naked
2,gavin6942,Interesting,7,15 January 2014,"Johnny (David Thewlis) flees Manchester for London, to avoid a beating from the family of a girl he has raped. There he finds an old girlfriend, and spends some time homeless, spending much of his time ranting at strangers, and meeting characters in plights very much like his own.What to make of this film... is Johnny an anti-hero? We follow him, making him our protagonist of sorts, but can we really stand behind him? I should think not. Yet, we listen to his ramblings about bar codes, the Bible and Nostradamus and see how he affects people. Is he insane or just misunderstood? David Thewlis is an incredible actor and he is a joy to watch even when he might not be playing the most honorable person. Great to see him perform so strongly in the days before ""Harry Potter"".",Naked
3,lee_eisenberg,London in the raw,10,18 September 2017,"Mike Leigh has spent his career focusing a lot on the United Kingdom's underclass. Another characteristic of his works is the slow pace, so as to help acquaint the audience with the characters. Both of these are apparent in 1993's ""Naked"". The movie shows a stark contrast between the working class and ruling class, as evidenced by David Thewlis's and Greg Cruttwell's characters. But this isn't simply a story of who's good and who's bad. These are multidimensional characters. Basically, it's a look at the bare reality of life for large numbers of British citizens, while also touching on issues like alienation and misogyny. Thatcherism had eviscerated the ideals of the '60s, leaving people hopeless (and we can see many of the characters living in cramped spaces).I don't know if I would call it Leigh's best movie - he's made a number of good ones - but it offers a good look at the desperation felt by large numbers of the UK's citizens in the wake of Thatcherism. The protagonist's conspiracy theories sound like something that Charles Manson would dream up.Anyway, good movie. Also starring Lesley Sharp and Katrin Cartlidge (who later starred in the Oscar-winning ""No Man's Land"" but died of blood poisoning shortly thereafter).",Naked
4,Quinoa1984,"it's a ""black"" comedy, emphasis on black to the point of being completely dark and hopeless - and unspeakably well crafted",10,1 March 2009,"Mike Leigh must have exorcised a few many good demons while writing Naked, and perhaps some of them were expunged during the actual filming. This is a London so dark, yet with such a biting sense of humor you need a long trench-coat and a pack of cigs to get the bits, that Charles Dickens might wet his pants. Not even so much by the state of things on the streets (only a couple of times, such as with the thugs or the guy putting up posters or Scottish folks abusing one another), but just by the sense of humanity on display. This is about a character going through the motions, someone who could go off at any second, and does at certain beats, and is, in a real and frightening sense, free as a bird - a tortured and torturous as f*** fowl that prowls the streets looking for shelter or a cigarette or some bloke like a night hotel manager or some girl working at a diner to unload some of his mental baggage.Johnny is too smart to be a crazy-as-hell bum muttering to himself on the streets, and perhaps he's too smart and far beyond cynical to really function as a ""9 to 5"" kind of guy. Played by David Thewlis in one of those blistering go-for-broke performances that people will still be talking about in years to come, he's from Manchester but got into some trouble, stole a car, and is now in London wandering about, trying to not spend much time in his ex-girlfriend's place (Sharp) or with her fragile flat-mate (Cartlidge). He wanders about having conversations- or rather ranting with some conversation here and there due to Johnny's undoubted inquisitive nature- regarding the possible ""end of days"", Nostradamus, Revelations, or just asking simple questions in-between, with more or less reasonable answers. Where will this lead him? He doesn't know, probably doesn't care, but we follow him anyway as if on some strange existential odyssey to nowhere in particular, except, perhaps, this guy's possible state of mind.What makes Naked even more incredible when reading about it is that at first glance one might think Leigh wrote a screenplay that was passionate and raw and uninhibited and let it all fly out through the characters, but in reality it was mostly improvised. This is something that caught me off-guard; what appears to be some careful or just simply naturalistic dialog is just that, but directed in such a way that it doesn't veer off and become TOO random. It's a touch of Cassavetes, how Leigh wants to pierce through the soul of someone through drama, but then there's also this bitterness that Leigh wants to explore, and what it means to have good (or some good) and then some not at all. He creates a delicate but proportional act of casting people who become real beings and not just faceless beings in this urban sprawl - the night-watchman, the girl working at the restaurant, the Scot played by Ewen Bremmer, the woman Johnny goes to see who is in the window across the way from a peeping tom - and making them as real and palatable as possible, and putting Johnny into a context as well.The character of Jeremy G. Smart (stone-cold amazing Cruttwell), for example, shows that Johnny is comparatively not so bad. This is someone who Leigh goes to great, maybe even excessive, lengths to show is a total horror of a being with no remorse and who rapes and acts mean and rotten with any woman he gets a chance to go with. He's like Patrick Bateman without the taste in music and slightly lessor blood-lust, but in the scope of the film is cast as a real horror-show, especially around Louise and Sophie who have no idea really why he's even there even as a landlord (for a short while I wondered just how he was supposed to be in the plot in some of his early scenes with the other woman, as intriguing and frightening as they were).But, with everything that Leigh puts into the film in terms of substance, and believe you me there's a LOT here to go through with pondering about man's state of affairs in a world where God doesn't give a s***, it's also Thewlis's show. He's in most of the movie and, from the rare moments of quiet and observation his character has to the bilious and wicked moments of wit that make him for little moments likable to the scenes where he's such an SOB, it's completely masterful work. With Johnny, Thewlis doesn't ask the audience to particularly like or dislike him, except that this guy is what he is, he'll live his life how he wants it, thinks the way he does, and doesn't try and pretend to give a simple explanation as to the ""why"" of his character being this way. Whatever hints or suggestions of a personal wounding back in Manchester take a back-seat to the present, how Johnny is in London, how he acts around people, and how he's very hard to pin-point: he's one of the darkest anti-hero's in recent memory, and it's possibly Thewlis at his best.Leigh, as well, is such a good storyteller that he makes us forget about the story and to just feel for these people, in one way or another, or to just get us thinking about how they'll react next or what they might say. It's an excellent British slice of life that has got more than a few worms on fresh display, with the smallest bits of joy or happiness almost in reach until it's back to what humanity can be: ugly, cruel, greedy, depressed. What fun!",Naked
5,hitchcockthelegend,What happens if a butterfly flaps its wings in Salford?,10,6 April 2013,"Naked is written and directed by Mike Leigh. It stars David Thewlis, Lesley Sharp, Katrin Cartlidge, Greg Cruttwell, Claire Skinner, Peter Wright, Ewen Bremner and Gina McKee. Music is by Andrew Dickinson and cinematography by Dick Pope.Johnny (Thewlis) is an unemployed wastrel who has to flee Manchester after indulging in his sexually violent proclivities. Heading for London to seek out an old girlfriend, Johnny encounters a number of people more hapless and lost than he is.Proles, Plebs and Potheads.Mike Leigh's brutal and raw character study remains as potent today as it was on release in post Thatcher Britain. Sometimes coined as a film for masochists or misogynists, Naked is actually for neither. For sure it isn't setting out to cheer you up, it's relentlessly restless and intense, it doesn't cut corners or operate under a banner of political convenience. Yet it does have intelligent depth to the point where the deeper you dig the more troubling Leigh's observations become. This allows Leigh and his brilliant cast to leave indelible images, to bring out themes that simply refuse to leave the conscious, where the observation of a society filled with sad, lonely and desperate people provides the discomfort of the human form stripped, well, naked.Ever seen a dead body?Only my ownJohnny is an intellectual, an intelligent man, even charming, he can chat freely on the world and man's existence in it. But he has unhealthy appetites and a knack for latching onto emotional discord. Posit this with a backdrop of dirty streets, cheap cafés and grungy flats, and there's a starkness about the narrative that scars the soul, aided considerably by Dickinson's edgy violin based score and Pope's stripped back colour photography. A concurrent character study with that of Johnny is that of Jeremy/Sebastian (Cruttwell), the definition of Yuppiedom gone wrong, the devil with a Filofax who is both cruel and predatory, he's the polar opposite of scruffy Johnny, but both represent a London that's far from the bright lights and big city so many hopeless dreamers set off in search of.A sick boy in search of Booze, Beans and a Bath.The Jeremy/Sebastian axis feels very much like satire, this also is something that makes Naked so strong, it is quite often funny. True, the humour here is clinical and comes in spiked barbs, but there are laughs to be had here, the kind that deftly dovetail with a pervading sense of bleakness, finding wit in the most unlikely of places. What is Leigh trying to say in all this? As usual he isn't offering up solutions to his questions, he demands you observe and respond, while he asks his actors to take the material and respond in kind, which they do, led by a quite extraordinary performance by Thewlis. Cannes agreed, awarding Thewlis with the Best Actor Award whilst also bestowing Leigh with the Best Director Award. Both were richly deserved.Never gratuitous, Naked is a sensitive and thoughtful film, yes it's tough to witness at times, it's meant to be, but this is a searing masterpiece that demands to be seen more than once. 10/10",Naked
6,Scarecrow-88,Naked,10,29 January 2007,"A volatile, yet brilliant social misfit, Johnny(David Thewlis, nothing short of amazing in a multi-faceted, complex performance)flees Manchester, after an incident with a woman on a street corner, dropping into London to ""visit"" an ex-girlfriend, Louise(Lesley Sharp, also quite good in a very subdued performance often communicating to us without saying anything at all regarding Louise's state of mind regarding Johnny). He doesn't like what he sees as Johnny often voices his displeasure with how it seems that being a nurse has brought little joy at all to Louise. Johnny makes the mistake of sleeping with Louise's pal, Sophie(Katrin Cartlidge, also brilliant). Sophie becomes so attached to Johnny, she becomes obsessive. He needs a breather so Johnny takes to the streets of London popping existential, philosophical questions to anyone, no matter who they are, he meets. Johnny's very confrontational and in-your-face which can be grating or annoying to those who wish for him to bugger off and leave them alone. Johnny can almost be a tick attaching himself to those he finds interesting. We often see Johnny reading lots of books, consuming knowledge so that he can toss out throwaway verbiage to those who might not have a single clue to what he is referring.These intellectual babblings with people on the streets who could care less for anything that comes from his mouth often get him into arguments and rejection for he can be a bit aggressive, blunt, and abusive with how he presents his theories and feelings.The film also delves into the darkside of a possible tenant named Sebastian(Greg Cruttwell), a masochist/sexual deviant who viciously attacks women who offer the possibility of sex. He's dangerous and quite scary..you don't know if he'll fly into a rage towards women or not. You just don't know because he's unpredictable and there's a fear Sebastian might harm Louise and Sophie(he does attack Sophie with rough sex..well, you might as well call it rape because she changed her mind about having sex with him after, at first, committing).All this plot is stirred in a depressing, bleak view from the very talented Mike Leigh who often shows the uncompromising realism of the grim world we live in. The tour-de-force performance(as well as the great cast)balances the despair of the film. Claire Skinner has a great role in her limited screen time as Sandra, a nurse who enjoys trips to places like Zimbabwe and has trouble communicating when order around her is disrupted(my favorite character actually..she can't finish sentences when everything around her is messy or disjointed).",Naked
7,evanston_dad,Mike Leigh Misfire Is Still Worth Watching for David Thewlis,7,19 November 2007,"Mike Leigh movies are never exactly laugh riots, but even with that ""Naked"" is one of the most dismal and surly films I've ever seen from him.Actually, the whole movie was a bit too one note for me, that one note being nihilistic. Leigh only diffuses his relentless tone of gloom in the film's last few moments, when it lurches unexpectedly and not entirely successfully into a kind of screwball comedy. It's a film that basically says men are brutes and pigs, and women are spineless victims -- it's not a flattering picture of either gender, and it doesn't have anything profound or even productive to say.However, and this is a big ""However,"" the film does have one huge asset to recommend it, and that is David Thewlis. He gives a fascinating and completely unique performance as Johnny, a sort of vagabond philosopher who wanders from stranger to stranger over the course of a long London night, pontificating about the meaning of existence and brutalizing just about every woman he comes across. Leigh presents London as a city full of lost souls, vulnerable to the opportunists who may come along to take advantage. One of those opportunists is the enigmatic Jeremy, a well-dressed affluent monster who glories in raping women and treating them like dogs. If Thewlis and his character is the film's strongest selling point, the character of Jeremy is its weakest. The two men exist separately for most of the movie, only to come together at the end. I'm not sure what purpose Jeremy's existence in the film serves, unless he's simply there to make Johnny look better. Certainly by the film's end, we've seen Johnny behave miserably, but we've also seen him treat his on-again-off-again girlfriend with something approaching affection, and Thewlis is so good that he's able to let us glimpse enough of Johnny's charm to make us understand why any woman would be remotely interested in him in the first place.This film reminded me of a Martin Amis novel. It has a slightly surrealistic, nightmare quality to it, and it's so caustic as to be off putting. But I would recommend it if for no other reason than to see Thewlis's remarkable performance.Grade: B+",Naked
8,paul2001sw-1,Visceral,10,1 August 2021,"David Thewlis's Johnny blows into Mike Leigh's 'Naked' like a malevolent whirlwind, a maelstrom of violence and wit. It's a breathtaking work, and if the devil gets all the best lines, Johnny has a while stack of them here. Thewlis is brilliant, of course, but Lesley Sharp plays straight against him to perfection. As often in Leigh's work, there's a slight tendency to over-emphasise the eccentric: Katrin Cartlidge's mixed-up stoner teeters on the edge of the absurd, while the abusive landlord seems to have ventured in from another movie; but the odd missed note is quickly forgotten. In some ways (not least in its ending) the film echoes another of my favourite movies, 'Five Easy Pieces', of whose lead character it is said that he can't love anybody else because he can't love himself; Johnny is far more psychopathic, but still never less than human. Many of Leigh's films have dark undersides, but no others have had quite the same energy and menace; I think it's his best dark.",Naked
9,kenjha,Rambling Man,3,15 October 2010,"A dirty, homeless man depends on the kindness of others for food and shelter and sex, although he acts like he is entitled. As the protagonist, Thewlis spews philosophy and Biblical verses, rapes women, abuses alcohol and drugs, and is unbelievably arrogant for a hobo with no money. Somehow he manages to not only find a bed to sleep on every night but also a woman to cuddle up with. It is unclear why everybody accommodates this ungrateful jerk. He is meant to be charming and intellectually engaging, but comes across as an annoying whiner. Carlidge is equally annoying as a druggie. Only Sharp is likable. There is no plot here. The film is just a vehicle for Leigh's rants.",Naked
10,johnnyboyz,"Leigh's pro-Bazin; pent-up and highly strung urban drama of anger, sordid ties and madness is a bare-boned white knuckle ride well worth seeing.",8,6 April 2011,"People will say what they will over the filmmaking style Mike Leigh has of just allowing dialogue and situations to brood out of a premise, which usually sees set sorts of characters just inhabit a locale before allowing natural exchanges and scenarios to manifest out of what they would do or might say to one another given their respective relationships. I think there's a moment in his 1993 film, entitled Naked, in which we see the process; the film's fierce and feisty lead character, played by David Thewlis, mocking a disturbed and somewhat mentally challenged young man by asking what it was his missing friend's name was, something made all the more distasteful when the young man's tic is to shout their friend's name at the top of his voice as he desperately searches for them anyway. The exchange is the last of their trade-offs, Thewlis' mocking enquiry a line of dialogue seemingly spoken out of turn when his co-working actor has his back to him and is about to walk off before turning to bleat the worn reply. At once a darkly amusing way to end an extended dialogue exchange, one cannot help but feel that at the end of a designated take, the process of just spontaneously coming up with something such as the above is Leigh's method of allowing dialogue to spawn out of coming-togethers and the exchanges his characters have, of which most are naturalised back-and-forths anyway.Thewlis' character is named Johnny, a wandering; scattered; aggressive and confrontational drifter feeding off of prolonged interaction with anybody who's in and around the area and up for listening to the elongated views of a man with not only some serious issues on his mind but with some rather serious issues regarding his mind. The lead is the sort of man whom, on one occasion at least, when caught out by a security guard whilst resting on the ground to the entrance of a large enterprise's headquarters building, will tell them to ""stick the boot in and get on with it so I can move on"". With such a pithy line comes the apparent acceptance of one's fate, that one's pain one is due to suffer anyway may as well be administered as briefly as possible so that one may shuffle off to the next engagement. When the film first reveals the man's face and offers the audience a good look at him from the front, it is when he stands on a pedestrian island cutting a street road in half in the process of turning to look at his surroundings having just got to London. Leigh has the camera glide past him in a smooth motion, as if we have just passed him on the street ourselves in the process of crossing the road; the manner in which the camera glances back at him suggests the perspective of somebody giving Johnny a second glance, glad that they've just walked passed him, this shaggy haired; bushy moustached; angry looking man.The films covers this wry, cynical individual and his intermittent interactions with an array of additionally sad, lonely and rather starved of affection sorts in and around the English capital city of London. His getting to London is a different matter altogether; the film beginning in the most unguarded of manners with a scene of crude sexual intercourse in an alleyway in Manchester between Johnny and a woman whom will eventually come to regret the experience; the stealing of a car and the hammering of it down a motorway minutes later seeing him end up at an old girlfriend's rented terrace house down south away from the strife. Here, he will find little else but the disenchantment and grounded-down living conditions which were most probably synonymous with him before. His exodus into the night begins with a long and prolonged take from the stairs of ex-girlfriend Lousie's (Sharp) house as he flits manically from room to room; the space enclosed and cramped and the sense of there being very little breathing room apparent. Johnny seems agitated and hindered for room, the film's refusal to cut building an uneasy feeling and Louise's persistent ignoring of Thewlis by watching a television tells us she isn't necessarily bothered about seeing him at all. A looming, overbearing item as to whether or not we actually feel for Johnny in any way hovers over proceedings; he is both instigator and himself a victim of violence throughout, a wandering soul not necessarily lost because he doesn't strike us as somebody with any set place to go.His presence is in stark comparison to that of Greg Cruttwell's Jeremy; a slimy, thin, wormy and ultimately pig-headed, cold blooded misogynist who's Johnny's ex-girlfriend Louise's landlord: a man able to make Johnny look a rather pleasant individual. Jeremy is a sports car driving; keep-fit fanatic Lothario with a penchant for tight-fitting clothes on his numerous female accomplices and the odd session of sadism and masochism. He enjoys the aggression and confrontation in life, a woman verbally matching him during one evening out at a restaurant clearly providing him with pleasure. How Cruttwell has been as vacant from screens as he has been since is a mystery, every sarcastic smirk with additional chortle; every priggish glance from one place to another as he sized things up carries with it effectiveness in its menace and distaste. The film manages to keep Jeremy misogynistic without ever allowing he nor Johnny's actions to have the film itself become misogynistic; the women in the film more often than not humane and seemingly normal with its men anything but. It does offer a one-off re-balancing to keep it from attracting tags of misandry by having Katrin Cartlidge's Sophie loose and air-headed just in as much it renders Peter Wight's security guard Brian as more down to Earth and normalised. As for Leigh, he manages to keep the film as gripping and as immersing from start to finish; 'method' in motion or not.",Naked
11,videorama-759-859391,"Only the lonely, in a one off and original Leigh great",9,3 June 2014,"Naked is something of a welcoming surprise, when I first saw it in 94', and in my opinion, was one of the best films I saw that year. The film works, mostly due to an incredible and original performance, that of David Thewlis, where the other two female leads are almost as good, especially, Cartidge, as the dependent Sophie, a heroin user, who's forced into performing some sex acts by the the conniving, malicious, and lonely pig of a landlord, Jeremy (Crustwell) though we're not sure he really is one at this point, when he makes this sudden intrusion. That's the thing about this film, every character is lonely, one such character, a night security guard, guarding what high strung and reckless 90's hero Johnny, (Thewlis) comically terms as ""Space"" which honestly is what he really he is doing. The film has an explosive and dramatic start with Johnny screwing a woman, where if it's rape, it's discernible, but with Johnny taking off quick to avoid a bashing, it must be. He arrives in Manchester and takes harborage at his ex-girlfriend's, Louise (Sharp) place. She's painfully lonely, obvious as day, where you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize she envies the more outward and sex loving Sophie. Starting up a relationship, with Johnny, where really she's suffocating him, he goes out on a solo walk, into the night cold. Thus begins a journey where he meets a collection of people, first two homeless drug users, a pre Trainspotting face, and very un Spud like. Basically the others are unhappy, discontent loners, one woman even creeping Johnny out. Naked, I must warn you, is surprisingly, and bloody funny, from an A1 script, insightful and sharp, ala: Mike Leigh, where Thewlis is lumbered with a lot, bringing a performance of reality that just paralyses you. Too Crustwell, who I only saw in another film was impressive as his character was a horrible being, but there we're reasons. After all, he informs us he's going to commit suicide when reaching the big 40. And he can get rough too. Near the end, we really see the characters for what they are, and that includes Crustwell: lonely. Again being Mike Leigh, what we have is a situation set, through the motions movie, that probably would of had rehearsed improv, All 4 leads deliver solid performances, but none finer than Thewlis, where I had to see more of this guy. As this being the only other Leigh film, I've seen besides Meantime, which I really liked, this is that controversial, stand out from the rest of the directors flick, where we have a brave, daring and bloody film, one set apart from all of Leigh's others. At the end, as Johnny departs, the relentless loser, we're actually sad to see him go, in a film, every movie connisseur, should put down as a must see, but more so, a must see Thewlis performance, one which will have a lingering effect on the viewer, years after it's watch. The title reveals a lot too.",Naked
12,Polaris_DiB,"Ego, Id, Y2K, and Wit",10,17 May 2007,"The cover of this film literally called to me for months before I finally took the time to sit down to see this film; I wish I had jumped on the opportunity sooner. ""Naked"" is a film of superb performance, dialog, and directing, and best of all: the driest of English wit and the most poignant analysis of Ego and Id.The movie starts on a long-take of a man, Johnny, raping a woman and then getting chased away by her family. The hand-held camera effect places us as spectator in a way that makes us ""there"", and from that moment, one can't help but feel a sense of responsibility to everything that happens from then on. Never again will we return to that hand-held style, but the entire resolving of effects throughout the rest of the film follow directly from that one moment the camera didn't prevent a bad situation from occurring.Johnny the rapist, however, is not some evil guy who uses violence on women unempathetically--instead, he's quite the intellectual and still pines for his ex-girlfriend in London. He lacks control and is hot-headed, but most importantly of all, he's guilt-ridden and driven to hide it. Rather than use Johnny as a way of providing empathy for rapists, however, Mike Leigh counter-balances him with ""The Landlord from Hell"" (there's a bit of a mix-up over what his real name is, though), the horror monster from the subconscious who's realm of carnage begins with Johnny's rape and stalks throughout the streets until eventually leading up to Johnny's own presence.A movie could hardly ask to be more disturbing (I've seen more disturbing, but oftentimes for the plain shock value of it), but what entices me even more about this movie is the very reserved, underlying sense of humor. Most of it comes from the physical presences of the characters as they speak, and how the actors really thrust their intentions forward despite all the in-dialog miscommunication and theatricality.Mike Leigh's ""Naked"" is notable as well for it's pre-Y2K emphasis on millennium apocalypse, a gamut of the era that helped define some of the existential malaise either overtly or understatedly felt in many intellectuals of the time. This theme can be funny to us in the latter part of the first decade of the 2000s, but it can also reveal a lot about how our society has come to be the way it is today.--PolarisDiB",Naked
13,smatysia,A truly dark film,6,4 February 2019,"A truly dark film. The main character, Johnny, is a seemingly well-educated, yet thoroughly despicable, misogynistic to the point of rape, character who is unsuited for modern life, basically a criminal who would never stoop to honest work. He is contrasted with an upper class character who is even more hateful, and even more cruel to women. There are some very good performances in this movie, but no one is at all likeable. I'm sure that this was the point, but it makes the film more like medicine than entertainment. I don't know whether I would recommend this movie or not.",Naked
14,Jonny_Numb,"rough, nihilistic, surreal, and surprisingly unpretentious",7,15 July 2006,"I suppose it is more than a bit ironic that, after watching Neil LaBute's ""In the Company of Men,"" I viewed Mike Leigh's ""Naked."" Both films deal in liberal doses of emotional abuse and depravity, and both are inexplicably marketed as comedic romps (is that the fate of every film distributors don't know how to categorize?). Oh well. This is the type of film that leaves you flabbergasted, confused, and angry; like David Lynch sans the surrealism, ""Naked"" leaves us thoroughly disoriented. We open on a back-alley rape perpetrated by Johnny (David Thewlis), a philosophy-spouting drifter who travels from encounter to encounter (a visit to an ex-girlfriend; an evening with a night-watchman; and an afternoon with an emotionally unkempt waitress). The film is more a series of vignettes than a singular cohesive plot, and its not-quite-earthbound tone and characters are complementary to it. David Thewlis is inspired as the emotionally volatile Johnny (his great performance makes you wonder why he is usually relegated to supporting roles in Hollywood dreck), and writer-director Mike Leigh should be credited with keeping what could have very well been a pretentious art-house fart under control. ""Naked"" is certainly not for all tastes, but those looking for a slice of weirdness with a bit of brain candy to chew on will come away satisfied.",Naked
15,truemythmedia,The Naked Truth,10,24 June 2019,"This is a bleak but powerful film about the hopelessness of the human condition, and while I don't entirely agree with what Leigh is trying to say with this film, I cannot deny that the way he said it was incredibly eye opening and real, and it's a film that deserves to be seen and appreciated. I urge caution to easily offended viewers, but if you can appreciate this film for more than the content, and look at what it is trying to say with it's overall message, this movie can be incredibly powerful.

He may never top his 1996 masterpiece, ""Secrets & Lies,"" but what he does all the time should be learned from by all. His breakout film was the 1993 pitch-black comedy/drama ""Naked."" No matter who you are, if you loved this flick or detested it, you will definitely be stunned by it.Long before playing Lupin in the Harry Potter films, David Thewlis was a struggling actor from Great Britain trying to make a name for himself. Thanks to the talented director, and Thewlis' own gifts, he turns in a mesmerizing performance at the very highest level possible. The whole movie really hinges on his. He has such conviction, is so layered, so deep, and is so damn smart. No way Lupin can be considered a better character or the better performance.Thewlis plays Johnny. With a very high intellect, he considers most people to be below him. He is pretty much misanthropic (hating everyone) but mostly a chauvinist. He also gets bored with things easily and tries to get cheap thrills. The way he wears a normal long black coat makes him look cool. Only Thewlis could have pulled it off. But Johnny is not a likeable guy.Johnny flees his area and travels to the slums of London to hide out with an old friend, Louise. She lives in a flat with unemployed Sophie and nurse, Sandra, who is away. Johnny's refuge doesn't last as he romances both girls and starts mistreating them. He leaves and travels the streets. He meets some interesting people and talks to them in a very mature matter. The best scene in the movie happens when a security guard lets Johnny into the building he's watching and they pretty much talk about the meaning of life. This scene alone is life-changing.There is a subplot involving a more violent misogynist-'The Landlord'-that eventually gets to be bad to Louise and Sophie. This could have been handled better as it has all the right ingredients.While everything that spews out of Johnny's is pure gold, the movie eventually runs out of gas. The Landlord getting to the main girls is underwhelming. After the final girl that Johnny seduces in his night out, he gets beaten up and it seems like Leigh stopped caring about giving us gold like earlier. This movie doesn't really have a plot, but there are events and things do unfold. Up until Johnny gets beaten in an alley, things were perfect.""Naked"" is a great example of heavily flawed and unlikeable people that are still drawn out a little too well to dump on. You can hate the characters, but every time something bad happens, we instantly feel for them. This isn't like ""St. Elmo's Fire"" where the people were a bunch of immature and spoiled brats. The real people in ""Naked"" are deep and the acting by all soar.Quite often, filming flawed individuals in decaying society is more interesting than seemingly perfect people. All need to be well-written and acted in order to work.So Mike Leigh's breakout hit might not reach the highest heights as a whole, but there are certain aspects that will blow you away.3.5/4",Naked
17,rosscinema,Thought provoking brutality and bleakness,7,5 May 2003,"Mike Leigh has given us another look at bleak characters in England and here we watch a drifter named Johnny (David Thewlis) who in the first scene of the film is having sex in an alley with some woman very brutally to the point where it makes the woman run off shouting at him so Johnny steals a car and drives to a former girlfriends home. She's at work but her roommate Sophie (Katrin Cartlidge) lets him in to wait for her. Sophie takes drugs and drinks and is a punk type that can give the double talk as fast as Johnny can. Johnny and Sophie have sex and later Louise (Lesley Sharp) gets home from work. Johnny stays for some time but then leaves. Film follows Johnny as he meets different characters like a night watchman, a waitress, a Scot with a nervous tic, a drunk woman spotted from a window and a man who pastes posters on walls. Meanwhile Louise and Sophies landlord Jeremy (Greg Crutwell) is a very cruel and brutal man who somehow convinces woman to date him and then later he brutalizes them to the point where you can call it rape. He comes to Louise's home and takes advantage of Sophie to the point where she becomes a shaking mess. He wont leave and the woman are very afraid of him. Leigh once again shows us sad characters who are trying to get through life. This is definitely one of Leigh's tougher films and he always assembles a good cast to make the sordid and downbeat material easier to view. Thewlis is just riveting as Johnnie. A very smart and fast talking man who can dazzle you with his knowledge on an assortment of topics but ultimately he abuses everyone verbally. He seems unable to answer a question clearly and at times in the film I had no idea what he was talking about. How could such a bright man have fallen through the cracks in life? He has one thing in common with Jeremy, they both brutalize woman when they have sex. Obviously they are unable to communicate tenderness and it suggests that something tragic happened to them when they were young. The title ""Naked"" is a reflection on how these characters are placed in this world. Johnnie uses his intellect and fast talking to try and get through life. Louise has a normal job and tries to convince herself that she is normal. Sophie drinks and takes drugs to keep reality away. The last shot in the film of Johnnie is a haunting image as he stumbles down the street. Some of Leigh's films are an acquired taste and I suspect this one falls into that category. This film is a little overlong but those who invest the time will view some terrific performances headed by Thewlis and a film that offers a dark look at some characters who all have their own way of dealing with the outside world.",Naked
18,Xstal,Don't Care in the Community...,8,20 October 2020,"You can conjure a myriad of possibilities for how each of the characters established here arrived at this destination. Your thoughts will invariably reflect your own social standing, feelings of self worth and political persuasions. An interesting reflection is to imagine where they might be now, how their lives have progressed, or not, as the case may be, as well as considering those in their twenties living similarly today. A visit to almost any high street and their homeless occupants will only compound those considerations.Thoughtful, powerful performances demonstrate what society, community and government can achieve when it stops caring.",Naked
19,blott2319-1,Ugly and unpleasant in every way,2,10 September 2021,"Naked is the story of frustratingly awful people behaving in frustratingly awful ways. David Thewlis plays the main character who goes on long annoying rants about everything in the world, and yet for some reason he finds people willing to sit through his babbling. This is the type of irritating good-for-nothing guy who would probably be more likely to find himself living on the street and begging for loose change on a subway platform in real life. He's made even more reprehensible by the way he uses and abuses women, so I struggled to tolerate him any time he was on screen. It almost felt like the equally offensive character played by Greg Cruttwell was needlessly added to the film so that we'd find someone worse to watch and could possibly think Thewlis was somewhat redeemable by comparison. But since he wasn't rampantly murdering people or something markedly worse, he just felt like a different take on the same guy. There's really no plot to talk about in Naked, so all you're left with is the atrocious characters and the nonsense ramblings that come from their mouths. None of this stuff was all that tolerable (with a couple interesting snippets that stood out from the rest,) so Naked was a complete bust for me as I expected.",Naked
20,tim-764-291856,"On the streets, or just side-stepping onto them?",9,1 November 2010,"Despite this probably being Leigh's most 'marmite' film, I still like it, a lot. David Thewlis' central character, Johnny, is a scruffy petty criminal who scabs his way onto people he used to know and, the main thrust of this film, those he doesn't.A woman he's followed down from Manchester (film is set in a sort of after-hours London) after assaulting another up north, he quickly engages other well-meaning folk. His strange mixture of philosophising, vulnerability and persistence warms him to others. He doesn't intend hurting them. In his own mind he probably isn't and to them he becomes a nuisance that they then turn tables on him, pushing him out into the nomadic metropolis. Along the way, they get caught up in his meandering and searching questions and often reveal things that they probably wouldn't to anyone else. A confessional no-hoper that they know they won't (or don't want to) meet again.As Johnny picks up bruises from scraps and verbal insults from the outlandish things he says, he's like a lame dog that we see soldiering on in an advert for the RSPCA. We feel sorry for him, we hope he gets better and that someone will rescue him. We'd give him a dog biscuit and stroke him. But not a bed. There is something very human in Leigh's portrayal of this charismatic and intelligent drifter, brought up to date from all those of earlier cinematic characterisations. A perfect casting of Thewlis who simply makes it his own and so superbly too. There is violence, both physical and sexual and the real language of angry people. It is also bleakly black in some of its humour and we cannot help imagining what we'd say or do should 'Johnny' ever engage our attention for real. Run, no. Be defencive, yes. Keep an open mind, yes. That's because there's one of these that we see so often they have become city street furniture. One step from being on the streets rather than just side-stepping onto them.",Naked
21,sjanders-86430,Mike Leigh directed,10,8 October 2021,"David Thewlis is raping a girl in an alley as the film opens. He then steals a car and drives to London. I think he's in Manchester to start. He goes to Lesley Sharp's apartment, because she sent him a postcard with her address. They had dated for a year. Sharp's roommate is Katrin Cartlidge who connects with Thewlis. She falls for him. The third roommate is a nurse, Claire Skinner, who is on a trip in Zimbabwe. She returns at the end. Skinner's boyfriend, Greg Cruttwell, is shown having sadistic sex with two women. He shows up looking for Skinner and has sadistic sex with Cartlidge. A night watchman watches a woman who Thewlis then degrades. Each encounter is a failure. A sad counter girl is attractive to Thewlis because she looks so sad. What does Thewlis want? His girlfriend Sharp will take him back. She cries when he is hurt.The characters come alive in their different struggles. The drinking smoking, drugs, violence surround the lousy jobs: a file clerk, a poster hanger, watchman, and chauffeur. The city is filled with danger. A gang out of Clockwork Orange attack and beat Thewlis then move on. A man looks for his girlfriend and hits her when he finds her. The pace is a runaway train. Will Sharp get Thewlis back? Nothing ends well. Cartlidge cries. Skinner soaks in the tub.This film is unforgettable. Thewlis's rants juxtaposed to the bleak night streets of London are powerful. There was no script. I think of the fire at the end of Elmer Gantry. The end of all childish things. This film has no childish things. These are adults forging ahead with only cliches for comfort.",Naked

A: At least the bus is going somewhere. Several adjectives come to mind in the screening of this Mike Leigh outing - Pointless, Uninteresting, Boring, Tedious, Irksome, Deadening, Pretentious, Overblown, and so on and so forth. All the women are so weak and needy, you'd think they were cast-off, one-legged, no-teeth lepers in a desperate colony somewhere. The reason i didn't give it just one star is because some of the acting was actually okay, Too bad there was no plot wrapped around it. The good news? You could save money on Ambien, Melatonin or any other sleep aid by watching this film. It's guaranteed to work or your money back.",Naked
24,Pedro_H,Razor-sharp social commentary - although too harsh for many stomachs.,8,6 November 2004,"An unemployed - but intelligent - social misfit goes on the run to London following a back alley rape, but finds The Capital just as desperate and alienating as his native Manchester.This is one of the hardest films I have ever had to review. Topics such as urban alienation, career-choice unemployment, leeching, homelessness, drug taking and sexual violence would normally send me running for cover; but what we have here is so well constructed and so skilfully acted that it transcends it own headline topics. This is a classic case of car-wreck film making: You don't praise or celebrate much, yet it is deeply fascinating and even hypnotic. People are tap dancing on the edge of a metaphorical cliff - some are there of there of their own free will.Director Mike Leigh's semi-improvisational style doesn't always work, but here it really delivers something unique. You feel that you are watching real life even though too much happens in too short a time period for that to be the case.This is a wandering odyssey film and features a central performance - by David Thewlis - that ranks along the best ever witnessed in cinema. How the Oscar people could have (totally) turned their back on a performance as a good as this puzzles; although the film and actor won prizes in Cannes and New York.This is the first film I have ever seen that takes on sexual coercion in a head on fashion. People that have put themselves in a chemical or social situation where someone has something over them. The greasy upper crust landlord (Greg Cruttwell) might seem over-the-top to many but I know a few people actually like that!(For the record his actions would be deemed illegal in real life - if you have seen the film.)What happens to the on-screen people the day after this film ends? Has anything really changed? For Johnny - our central anti-hero - it will be just another day to duck and dive, avoid all work and wind people up using his extensive back reading.",Naked
25,christophe92300,No purpose,3,27 October 2013,"In a drab, glacial, shabby London, Mike Leigh offers a disjointed succession of encounters you can't seem to grasp the essence of and that nothing, or almost nothing can be drawn from.As the main character, you wonder in a mass of raw ideas that for some are incredibly under-exploited, like Johnny's past and his physical and mental condition, and that for others are rather unrealistic, like the feminine behaviour in general.Paradoxically, the movie is very talkative in philosophical theories and other mystical tirades, and meaningless. Not to mention that with a duration of a little more than two hours, one can't say this movie is very digestible.What was the goal of the movie ? Which themes the director wanted to address ? What was the message he wanted to convey ? So many questions left unanswered.",Naked
26,beresfordjd,Leigh at his worst,3,6 November 2010,"I usually really like Mike Leigh's films-even the bleaker ones. This I loathe. It purports to be ""realistic"" I think. It fails miserably unless I have led to sheltered a life. The sort of people portrayed here are not unintelligent but behave like the lowest of the low, they are articulate,even witty but say nothing much that rings true. Thewlis is not the actor lots of people would tell us he is-his portrayal is mannered and hammy. The rich guy is caricature and the women are stupid for the most part. People just do not talk to each other in the way they do in this movie. I find it hard to see why so many people think that it is a masterpiece of film-making. Leigh has over indulged his actors by allowing them to improvise and say pretty much nothing. I am aware that this is the way he works but the whole thing is way off beam. I just do not believe it.",Naked
27,MartinTeller,Naked (1993),9,10 January 2012,"Bleak and cynical and often uproariously funny. The bleakness would be overwhelming if not undercut so frequently with the humor of Johnny's rants. Much of the credit belongs to David Thewlis, whose brilliant work is comparable to McDowell in CLOCKWORK ORANGE or DeNiro in TAXI DRIVER. His character Johnny doesn't so much straddle the line between good and evil as he does swerve back and forth over it like a drunk driver. Johnny's darker qualities are neither negated nor mitigated by his charm, but his charm is substantial, with a wonderful gift for gab, a sense of intellectual curiosity, and a sarcasm-tinged but nonetheless genuine compassion for his fellow man buried under the bile. When Thewlis is on screen, he's riveting.Lesley Sharp is also superb as his ex-girlfriend, bravely attempting to maintain an air of stoicism in the face of Johnny's misanthropy, and Katrin Cartlidge is heartbreaking, if a bit shrill.The sour note in the movie is Sebastian/Jeremy, whose absolute vileness doesn't ring true in the context of the rest of the characters, who occupy much greyer territory. Perhaps he's simply there to make Johnny look not so bad in comparison. However, his role is small enough to overlook his presence, or at least consider it as the one truly rotten part of an otherwise excellent whole.",Naked

I have enjoyed many other films by Mike Leigh, but not this one.The main character travels around aimlessly, which is something I might typically enjoy in a film, if it's done right. He discusses philosophy and the dialog seems very badly written to me. The acting is bad too. Do not recommend.",Naked
29,Ali_John_Catterall,The omelette stinks,9,12 November 2009,"Naked, as implied by its title, is raw, uncompromising cinema, the least comforting manifestation to date of what Mike Leigh calls his ""celebration of human experience""; yet there are also moments of tenderness, necessary chinks of compassion spearing the murk. It is also bitingly, appallingly funny.The film was borne out of Leigh's then preoccupations with the tension between spiritual and material values, some tougher aspects of the relationship between the sexes, and above all, a profound sense of impending, apocalyptic doom. 'Pre-Millennium Tension', Tricky called it in 1996, for an album steeped in paranoia, ""psychic pollution"" and regret. ""Forever - what does that mean?"" asks his lover. ""It means we'll manage"" Tricky grimly retorts. Manage. For Naked's damaged roster of characters, churning out their faded sexual rituals or wearily braced for more verbal and physical trauma, simply 'managing' would be a desirable state to attain.As Leigh told 'Cineaste' in 1994, ""In so far as Naked is about England, the fabric of society is collapsing. People are insecure, there is a sense of disintegration which is, as much as anything else, a legacy of the Tories."" The previous decade's boom and bust had left almost every strata of society reeling, with a great many financially or emotionally ill-equipped for the subsequent recession, the period in which the film is set. It is hardly surprising that more people were admitted into psychiatric care during the 1980s than in any previous decade; subsequently released into communities which no longer existed or didn't care about them.The Poll Tax levy, fleecing the poorest communities while propping up the richest, had also contributed to more numbers of homeless than ever. And Naked's original remit was to have focused on the street, until Leigh decided the subject was too one-dimensional. ""Maggie!"" bawls twitching Scots straggler Archie (Ewen Bremner) helplessly, in one of the film's subtler allusions. ""She's gone, mate"" mutters David Thewlis's Johnny, chief pallbearer of the post-Thatcherite malaise. ""Those days are over."" However, Naked ought not to be taken chiefly as a state-of-the-nation polemic: the film working out of a broader European tradition of dark, existential allegory. Here, the homeless are those who have been disenfranchised from family, jobs, values - and us, for we can only guess at their stories, as they stumble like medieval cripples through a heightened, Dante-esquire vision of urban London.The sole emblematic landmark to be glimpsed is the BT Tower looming high above the horizon: more unreachable communication. Appropriately, for a drama exploring rootlessness and displacement, the Naked City (shot in pitiless bleach-bypass to imbue the film with a grainy, Dickensian quality) has collapsed in on itself, having entered a black hole respecting no spatial perimeters. Johnny's sleepless odyssey through the capital's cafes, empty office blocks and bedroom floors will take him from Soho to Shoreditch in minutes.Almost everybody in Naked is on the move, arriving or departing, to Andrew Dickson's driving, melancholy score. But rarely digging in, lending the film its picaresque quality - a latter-day pilgrim's progress through the Inferno. As befitting a film dealing with the end of days, mythical and Biblical references abound, from 'The Iliad' to the 'Book Of Revelation': Johnny's number of the Beast 'barcode' rant had been prompted by a pamphlet handed to the actor in the street, and its execution - an astonishing verbal juggling act in silhouette - would take around two dozen takes to perfect.With his head framed against the halo-making rays of a Roman clock, Johnny is both broken Christ and testing devil, crying out to save souls, to reach somebody - anybody - while simultaneously flagellating them for their crucifying ennui. ""Do you believe in God?"" he's asked at one juncture. ""Of course I believe in God,"" he snaps back. Faith, or lack of it, is not the issue. The question is: what manner of maker has led us to this point? All performances here are exemplary, including stunning turns from the late, great Katrin Cartlidge who plays the desperate, self-medicated goth Sophie, and Lesley Sharp, Johnny's ex-girlfriend Louise and Naked's moral compass. In Johnny himself (a slice of Lydon, a shave of Lennon and a dose of Mark E Smith) director and actor would create a complex mix of the callous and compassionate, though rarely without a splenetic machine-gun wit: the survivor's apparatus. Only once will a comeback desert him, when ""insecurity guard"" Brian tells him: ""Don't waste your life."" Thewlis had read the equivalent of a small bookshop to prepare for the part, and the ever-present dog-eared paperbacks in Johnny's satchel are like his theories; things to be picked up, appropriated or stolen, then put down. For the autodidact who expresses his sense of self though words, the permanent removal of those books will precipitate his breakdown.That breakdown was ""more or less real,"" Thewlis told this writer, years later. ""That's how I felt - raging. The origin of it is where we experimented with him going inside himself. What I come out with at that point is fairly incoherent and ambiguous, and that's based on this day we had which we used to refer to as the 'Wobbly'. When we were filming the scene it was like 'Okay let's go there now'. I went to a bit of a strange place in my head. It was worth it."" Thewlis still receives plaudits for Johnny, and still receives work off the back of it. Steven Spielberg once requested an audience with him, after Spielberg, Martin Scorsese and Brian De Palma spent a night arguing about the film. ""I get this quite a lot"" he muses. ""People either come up to me and say 'You changed my life', 'That was me', or 'You said everything that I've ever thought'. A few religious nuts in America wrote to me saying 'Remember, God loves you.'""",Naked
30,glgioia,"The Yin to Scorsese's ""After Hours"" Yang, or vice versa",9,3 July 2005,"Homer Lives!!! Apparently will forever, as this theme of the wandering protagonist and the series of odd adventures carried out with even odder characters is perhaps mankind's most enduring tale. At any rate, filmmakers never tire of retooling it. Director Mike Leigh selects as his Ulysses, a drifter intellect who sounds almost exactly like John Lennon, and then drops him into the bizarre underworld of London after midnight. His overnight travails constitute the meat of the film, but is sandwiched nicely between explanatory background and character revelation, as we sorta see just who this guy is, and what he's all about. Sorta. In my opinion, this film is borderline genius in almost every aspect. The acting, especially Thewlis, is near perfect, and is one of those rare movies you watch and watch just to soak in the quality of the actors efforts. I find the dialog likewise remarkable, and genuinely clever. Not contrived clever, like we get all too often. Here, it all seems real even inspired. The trouble for this film is the subject matter is harsh or rather the characters trudging through the subject matter are certified lowlifes, and I suppose hence the title. Modern enlightened man we see as still for the most part nothing more than a nature driven helpless animal. You spin the clock back another ten years, and it would need to be chopped up considerably just to earn an R rating. Its gonna rub a lot of people the wrong way, and probably cloud the overall appreciation. If your sensibilities aren't all that fragile, you would be well served in giving this a look, if only for the simple reason that quality film-making like 'Naked' is an absolute anomaly.",Naked
31,dr_clarke_2,Grotesque and compulsively watchable,8,31 October 2020,"Mike Leigh's films are known for their gritty social realism. His 1993 film Naked is cut from the same cloth as the rest of his work, but in many ways it is very different. Rather than tackling a particular social issue, it instead follows the central character of Johnny Fletcher, a vile, eccentric anti-hero, as he wanders around London espousing his bizarre world views to anyone who will listen to him and a few people who won't. It's bizarre, striking, and really rather odd.
Naked opens with Johnny raping a woman in an alleyway and then fleeing to the east end of London to avoid reprisals. Arriving at the flat rented by his ex-girlfriend Louise, he sets about seducing her flatmate Sophie, before getting bored and wandering off into London, where he encounters a pair of foul-mouthed Glaswegians, a philosophical security guard, a drunken woman he sees undressing through a window whom he seduces and then rejects, a young woman working in a café whom he initially seduces and then repulses, a short-tempered man whose job is to drive around putting up posters, and finally a gang of random thugs who beat him up for no apparent reason. Battered and bloody, he returns to Louise's flat, gets patched up by her other flatmate Sandra, and then limps off into the streets again having stolen a wad of cash.
It's an odd film. Johnny is obnoxious and egotistical, but intelligent and intellectual. He's contrasted with Greg Cruttwell's Jeremy, another rapist and a sadist who unlike Johnny is well off and lives in an expensive home; whilst Johnny wanders the streets, Jeremy barges into Louise's flat, rapes Sandra, and then hangs around in his pants leering suggestively until Louise forces him to leave at knifepoint. Leigh has said in an interview that Johnny's behaviour is a result of his frustration with the world, whereas Jeremy's comes from somewhere much darker. Whatever the reason, they are both reprehensible, but whereas Jeremy is entirely loathsome, Leigh invites us to sympathise with Johnny simply by making us spend nearly two hours in his company. And it works, to a degree, partly because David Thewlis gives a blistering, magnetic performance.
The draw here is watching the film's broken, damaged characters as they stumble through a few hours of their lives. Johnny affably helps the Glaswegians find each other for no real reason, and he bonds with Brian the security guard because they find a connection of sorts. Intellectually on a level with Johnny, Brian reads at his desk whilst Johnny reads on the doorstep of the building her guards, until Brian invites Johnny inside, risking his job for the sake of a meaningful conversation. For all his intelligence, Johnny is a highly educated idiot who has developed his own lunatic fringe theories about the apocalypse; the same of course applies to Brian and in one celebrated scene, they passionately debate their differing world views.
In contrast to Leigh's other films, none of the characters in Naked ring true. They are caricatures, not characters; grotesque, warped parodies of people. Sophie and the drunken woman whom Johnny seduces then rejects are, respectively, implied drug addicts or drunks living in squalor, but they don't quite act or react quite like one expects such characters to do. In fact, the prim nurse Sandra is the arguably the most believable character in the film. The film's air of unreality is reflected in Leigh's decision to blatantly depict a geographically inaccurate version of London, but one that is instantly recognisable. It is a London of dark stairways and shadowy alleyways, which has been compared to film noir.
All of which means that Naked is difficult to interpret. Numerous reviewers have espoused theories as to what Johnny represents, from a Thatcherite version of Michael Caine's Alfie to a twisted modern version of Jesus. Leigh himself has stated in interviews that some of his fans have interpreted it as a sort of ""great Manc poem"", whilst adding that he sought to make a film about unacceptable male behaviour. It certainly is that, but it neither condemns nor glamorises it, merely observing and accepting it instead. The bathroom scenes between Johnny and Louise show seemingly genuine affection between them, but the ending - which sees Johnny take the money left by Jeremy and head once more into the London streets - suggest that he is irredeemable.
But whatever Naked may really be about, it remains compulsively watchable. Partly, this is due to the performances, not just Thewlis' but also Peter Wight's as Brian, Lesley Sharp's as Louise, the late Katrin Cartlidge's as Sophie, and Greg Cruttwell's as the foul Jeremy. Partly it is because the often surreal dialogue is endlessly fascinating, and partly it is because of the cinematographer of Dick Pope, which distorts London through a lens that perfectly suits the atmosphere of Leigh's script and vision. At times, he shoots the film as though making a documentary, albeit one filmed in a near-monochrome London with warped topography. This is nicely counterpointed by an elegant score from semi-regular Mike Leigh collaborator Andrew Dickson, which should be at odds with the low-key grittiness of the film but somehow works.
Naked either has less to say than Mike Leigh's other works, or simply says it so cryptically that everyone disagrees what its message is. Nevertheless, it makes for fascinating, compelling viewing and is one of his finest films.",Naked
32,inframan,One of the greatest films of all-time.,10,16 December 2000,"Another title (but with much less punch) for this movie might have been Truth. Because that's what Johnny's into: peeling all the layers of make-believe & let's pretend from every aspect of life. Which is why the characters in the film as well as many of the viewers of it are so uncomfortable in his presence. Johnny is just not polite to or considerate of other people; he Thinks Too Much. He's a contemporary Raskolnikov. I've watched Naked many times & read the script while viewing (I find this useful with a lot of Mike Leigh's masterpieces). This movie is dangerous & subversive to anyone who worships the twin contemporary gods of Fashion & Success. It totally demolishes the concepts of Security & Identity, the twin anchors in today's sea of existence.",Naked
33,XxEthanHuntxX,A Doomsday Prophecy,8,27 July 2020,"As the film progresses, an image of a self-destructive, neurotic, sadistic, pessimistic, extremely intelligent, strangely charming and deeply cynical Johnny emerges as he wanders the streets of London in helpless frustration before the approaching turn of the millennium. Against his will, he becomes a doomsday prophet who alternately touches, alternately destroys the people he meets at night.David Thewlis makes a completely incomparable performance and despite the fact that the film itself is a terribly tragic, Leigh has managed to come up with a brilliant black comedy that permeates the entire film. Although, that part was a bit hard to comprehend, and in my eyes a great intentional structure but a not as great of a executional final input, thus it was fiercely confusing.Absolutely fantastic, although its symbolic meaning remains somewhat enigmatic. Everything from the directing, script and acting to the scenography, music and cinematography is spot-on. The environment of a British city is excellent and the run-down neighbourhoods seem to support Johnny's doomsday prophecies very well.A strangely compelling and uniquely philosophical film with no real plot, and Its something about the atmosphere which makes you see beyond that world trough a glass darkly.",Naked
34,mlraymond,"Scathing film mixes humor and despair ,with a tiny bit of hope",9,14 January 2007,"To say that this film is a challenge for the viewer would be putting it mildly.You have to be willing to watch at length the anti-social, mean-spirited, violent, and half insane antics of a bedraggled misfit who considers himself a deep thinker, and spends 90% of his time starting arguments with strangers, and verbally abusing everyone he comes across. There are two scenes in which he gets the crap beaten out of him, which gives frustrated viewers some satisfaction, after enduring over two hours of his nasty, nihilistic attitudinizing.That said, the character Johnny, though basically a total asshole, is not entirely unsympathetic, though he comes close. After a while, you begin to realize that he's a severely damaged human being, whose ugly behavior toward others, especially women, is a reflection of the ugliness around him. He may be mentally ill, though I don't think so. He certainly is physically ill, to the point that many viewers believe that he may very well be dying, which would make sense of some of the more extreme things he says and does.He is capable of unexpected generosity at times, such as when he essentially manages to reunite the young Scottish couple who have gotten separated in an unfamiliar city. In a more conventional movie, he would eventually be revealed to be a nice guy after all, a bad guy with a heart of gold. We get indications of abuse and neglect in his background, which have helped make him the bitter misanthrope he is, but there are occasional hints that he could have turned out a lot better. What's ambiguous is that he seems to have more or less chosen to be the obnoxious person he is, with no real effort at being a better human being. The appalling character of the creepy landlord, who is in many ways a smoother, affluent version of Johnny, is so much more despicable, that Johnny almost looks good by contrast.I think he is in the movie to indicate that even Johnny isn't totally beyond redemption, if such a vile man could exist, who's even worse.The acting by all the cast is excellent. The women are a pretty sad lot, which is a source of many complaints against this movie, but they are all quite believable. The film is full of lonely, emotionally crippled individuals, lost in a bleak modern world that offers little hope for the future. Johnny's old girlfriend and her nurse room mate are the two strongest and most positive characters in the movie, both showing compassion and a belief in trying to make the world a better place, even in a limited way, rather than give in to the despair that Johnny advocates, or the sociopathic attitudes embodied in the landlord.This is not the easiest film to watch, and is definitely not for everyone. But for those viewers who can stick with it, it is a strangely rewarding picture. It is worth seeing once, if for no other reason than the astonishing performance of David Thewlis as the main character.",Naked
35,eskimosound,One of The Best Movies...,10,26 July 2021,"This Movie is excellent. Purely excellent, from it's totally improvised script to Thewlis actually going homeless to get into character. I like Mike Leigh, there's always an authenticity you don't get from other Directors like Ken Loach for example. Leigh gets the dialogue right, the timing, the lighting, the sets...all natural, a real talent. It also helps that he employs excellent actors. So this is a harrowing story about Johnny an antihero that you can't help liking. It's excellent just watch it!!",Naked
36,noahgibbobaker,Quickie.,8,30 November 2020,"I didn't know what to expect going into naked. I knew nothing about it and I've never seen a Mike Leigh film. I'll definitely be checking out more of Mike Leigh's work.All I have in regards to substantial criticism is the ridiculous amount of times the main score was used. It became very tedious after the twentieth time I heard it, by the halfway point of the film I was actually quite taken out by these few bars of music. The only other criticisms are very minor, probably not even worth mentioning as it would be a bit of a waste of precious time.The acting was pretty great throughout. David Thewlis was absolutely brilliant and Katrin Cartlidge was also good. Peter Wight was also fantastic, he played a fairly minor character, but when he was on screen with Thewlis that's when I thought the film was at its best.Naked actually reminded me of Tarkovsky's stalker a little bit. The similarities don't go very far and this comparison is a stretch but I still think they're similar in... a way or two. There's a singing to sleep scene near the end of the film (I know this means literally nothing), and there is not really an end goal for the characters, Johnny in particular. He just wants to understand people and they're different perspectives on absolutely everything. This doesn't really relate to stalker on paper I'm just realising now, but it's the way these scenes are presented and the way they play out that is similar to stalker.Leigh's screenplay was probably my favourite element of the film, either the clever writing or the clever cinematography I can't decide. The writing wasn't as good during the final moments of the film, but it wasn't bad by any means. I just thought it feel off a bit compared to the philosophical ramblings the rest of the film consisted of. These are by far my favourite scenes, I could watch this film over and over just to see them over and over.",Naked
37,ivanmessimilos,Quasi-philosophy movie,4,2 August 2021,"I have read a lot of praise about this film which celebrated director Mike Leigh and won numerous awards at the Cannes Film Festival (for film, actor, director). I was personally disappointed by the film and it is obvious that this kind is not for me. We have two main male characters, but it turns out that the latter is a totally irrelevant character because he appears in only a few scenes. The main character is Johnny who is well-read and educated, but is also a cynical and sexual assailant. He wanders the streets of London, meets many people and has strange conversations with them. These conversations became boring to me after a while because the character talks about the meaning of life, the apocalypse, the end of the world, and other similar topics. I experienced this as quasi-wisdom, philosophizing not to say some ugly word. At times, the film was definitely pretentious to me because of the amount and type of conversation, and I didn't care about any of the characters in the film.",Naked
38,dakjets,Dark and demanding,8,7 July 2019,"I am a great fan of Mike Leigh and think all his films are both sophisticated and insightful. This one too. But unlike many other of his films, this is more demanding. And dark. This film also gives insight into those who fall outside society. Everyday people struggling and who he manages to provide insight into.
This film is more demanding in that the protagonist exploits other weak and has a woman's view that is heavy to look at. Here, there are both sexual assaults and mental stresses we are witnessing, but Leigh always manages to bring this about in a realistic way. Leigh is good at giving the characters credibility, and the brilliant actors make it a great experience to see this movie as well. This film is a counterweight to so much else and anyone who appreciates great film art should give it a shot.",Naked
39,galensaysyes,Unpleasant claptrap,2,23 August 2000,"The first film of Mike Leigh's I saw was ""High Hopes"", which I liked because it was (1) new (to me) and (2) funny. But with each successive work, the spuriousness of his dramaturgical effects at their worst becomes more obvious, and never more so than in this film, which is (1) old, (2) serious, and (3) gruelingly unpleasant. As is well known, he builds his scripts from his actors' improvisations. But since those don't make for drama, only bits of drama or near-drama, he has to attach them together with playwriting tricks, which amount to actor's tricks--claptrap. His favorite one, which occurs somewhere in nearly all his movies and TV plays, is the extended monologue in which the character begins cheerily, then unravels before our eyes. (In his first TV play, ""Abigail's Party"", this was extended for two hours.) The principal device used in this film is the extended monologue in which the character rails at someone who just sits numbly and takes it--and the audience has to, as well. This film is basically a play in two acts set in a grubby flat and consisting largely of slagging by a nasty, ugly creep who's always either bullying or being bullied or both at once. There is a central interlude in which the film actually becomes cinematic for a while, and to facilitate which it trumps up highly improbable reasons for the creep to leave the flat and return later. The same could be said of the events that usher him in and out of the story. In the play he's one thing; in the interlude he's another: a man who has chosen--if we're to believe him--to stay homeless as a social statement. Now that would have been an interesting character to make a movie about. But in the play proper he's no such thing, he's not homeless, he's a parasite who makes his home with whoever his current host body happens to be. Eventually he passes on to a new host body; and why? and why do any of them let him take over? Because otherwise the play couldn't happen. The second act works in another disagreeable character, on another incredible pretext--because otherwise the climax wouldn't happen--and he promises to give the creep a run for his money, but he doesn't, in dramatic terms, nobody does until the very end, or we couldn't suffer the ordeal we're meant to. But why should we? The dramatic devices being used on us work--that's why they've seen such long service--but as used here they're torture devices. Torturing an audience isn't the same as giving them a meaningful dramatic experience.",Naked
40,leavymusic-2,A rare piece of fine 1990's filmmaking.,9,13 February 2020,"Possibly Mike Leigh's finest hour or two!All actors are perfectly casted.David Thewlis lead role performance as the downtrodden young man of eternal gloom with flares of weird clever optimism.His perceptions, extensive sarcastic comedic reprisals are outstandingly played of from a superbly written script, this could only have been created by Mike Leigh and played out in a London setting in the early 1990's.A must for fans of sobering heart felt, frightening realism, wrapped up with slices of dark, stark black humour. It's superb.",Naked
41,karl_consiglio,A truly great film!,10,15 September 2006,"This film is so bleak. This is black humour at its best. Its filled with characters most normal people would like to forget but for years my friends and I had this film in common in the sense that we all had it in our top five favourites to date. Johnny was our hero, our role model and alter-ego, he was the man and at the time we believed in following in the same footsteps or simply relating to him. we liked how he just abandons all and ventures into the streets, a very well read character with not a care in the world anymore. Johnny truly is a genius. He picks on all sorts of characters for a clever chat but we find out that he still has a lot to learn and mostly a lot to be grateful for no matter the points he is trying to make. This film has a truly truly great great script bursting with witticism.",Naked
42,crculver,Memorable for its characters so lifelike that you come away feeling that you know them personally,8,17 June 2014,"Mike Leigh's 1993 film NAKED is a drama on sexual relations -- how men hurt women, how some women accept that hurt out of low self-esteem and a desire to be wanted or supported. It is distinguished by its remarkably lifelike characters. Most of the film was worked out in improvisations for several months before shooting began. Leigh wanted his actors to create elaborate back stories for their characters, fully living inside of them so that when the cameras started rolling they would be completely convincing.As the film opens, Johnny (David Thewlis) has to flee Manchester after a sexual encounter with a married woman turns into rape and she threatens to set her husband after him. Stealing a car, he heads to London to crash at his ex-girlfriend Louise (Lesley Sharp), gets involved with her flatmate Sophie (Katrin Cartlidge), and spends a couple of nights homeless in London. Interspliced with this are scenes of Jeremy, a rich real estate broker whose sexual conquests serve as an upper-class counterpart to Johnny's own. Naturally the viewer is led to wonder what will happen when these two men meet.Something is wrong with Johnny, he answers anything said to him with a rambling torrent of words, a logorrhea that is a form of intellectual bullying; this deeply wounded man seems to feel the best defense against the cruelties of the world is a good offense. Only 27, Johnny is so wasted that he is taken for much older. In this, Thewlis's performance is one of the masterful screen portrayals of an eccentric or mentally ill person, like Dustin Hoffmann in RAIN MAN or Peter Sellers in BEING THERE.But all of the characters here are memorable, and my thoughts have often gone back to them in the time since I saw this film. I do have reservations about the plot, inasmuch as the last scenes of the film (which were decided only late in the filmmaking process) too suddenly change the tone and may seem anticlimactic. Nonetheless, I would recommend this film and believe it a great one in spite of its undeniable flaws.",Naked
43,trans_mauro,Lots of cigarettes...,1,18 August 2011,"Hummmm,I was told that this was one of the best British films ever made. Well, if that is the case, now I know why the UK is not an empire anymore.What is the point of depicting the scum of the human race, weak and stupid women, losers, a succession of rape scenes, and a lot of smoking.I guess I am stupid, unsophisticated, but I really do not understand what is the objective of these artsy-fartsy films. Is this how ""normal"" people behave? Should one care for those idiots pictured in the film? What do we learn from it? What is the message? Funny thing is that when these ""avant-garde"" directors and screen writers decide to ""create"" something innovative they resort to the cheap trick of shocking the audiences with ugly sex scenes, lowlives, losers, drug addicts and all other types of human garbage, with the hope of gaining the ""hearts and minds"" of the ""intellectuals"" and the ""thinking elite"" which seem to enjoy such drivel.I rather watch my garbage rot than watching something like that again. At least, the rotting of garbage is an useful and interesting biochemical process. On the other hand a movie like ""Naked"" is like garbage that never rots away, it stays putrid, rancid, bad-smelling and ugly for ever.",Naked
44,timmy_501,Mike Leigh creates a memorable character then dissects him,9,20 August 2010,"Naked follows a few days in the life of Johnny, a cynical but garrulous drifter who flees to the apartment shared by his ex-lover Louise and her vulnerable friend Sophie. Johnny is an unusual sort of character; he seeks out companionship and then proceeds to turn his caustic wit on the very people he is reaching out to. Given many of his actions, including multiple violent sexual encounters, it should be difficult to relate to him but he's strangely sympathetic most of the time as he seems to be a desperate man thrust into a society fueled by illusions he has never bothered to acknowledge, let alone buy into. So he constantly looks for some meaning in his life that he will never find; if he was the kind of person that could buy into an explanation for his existence he wouldn't be looking for that explanation to begin with.Naked's narrative structure consists of a series of conversations, most of which are between Johnny and the various people he encounters in his journeys around London. It plays out like a more realistic and serious version of After Hours. There's also a subplot involving Jeremy, a character that is essentially Johnny's opposite: where Johnny always jokes and never laughs Jeremy never jokes and always laughs, where Johnny can't stop talking Jeremy says as little as possible, where Johnny seems to attract most of the people he meets Jeremy seems to repulse the same people, where Johnny is a penniless drifter with no place in society Jeremy is a rich businessman with myriad connections. Jeremy's purpose in the movie is two-fold: first, his cold detachment stands in stark contrast to Johnny's raw humanity; second, his entrance into Johnny's life as a dramatic foil injects the film with meaningful conflict. This conflict and its resolution sets the stage for the key conversation between Johnny and Louise.In spite of the episodic nature of the plot, writer/director Mike Leigh managed to create a coherent narrative that gradually builds toward a moment of clarity that lays bare the nature of his expertly drawn protagonist. The viewer sees the naked soul of this character and it's a devastating sight.",Naked
45,Camoo,Thank you Mr. Leigh for this spiritual experience,10,7 April 2007,"Wow, I love films like this. Bursting at each seam with a kind of flamboyant energy found only during long drug binges or a series of coincidental and uplifting events in someone's life. This was my first Mike Leigh experience, and it became a long lasting and still-standing marriage between myself and the director's films. I compare his style somewhat to that of Robert Altman's, only in that he can make a film like this, a wry, dark and intelligent drama, and turn right around and make a wacky, off the wall Victorian theater comedy like Topsy Turvy. The man has incredible range, I'll give him that. There is a careful visual strategy to this film, one that might go unnoticed on first viewing because of the rocket-fire dialog that might take your attention away from the setting- watch carefully during the opening scenes as background action walks over the same planned ground as later in the film. Blink and you'll miss a beautiful shot of a building with a group of doctors wheeling trays in the opposite direction of the main character. This action seems so natural, but it in fact makes for perfect compositions every single time, and therein lies Mike Leigh's genius, in his ability to control his improvised style into such a way that it all looks mathematically mapped and charted way before he cast any die. If not for that, watch this film for the spectacular exchange between Daniel Thewlis and Ewan Bremmer, and Thewlis's stunning performance in general. You'll never see Harry Potter the same way.",Naked
46,groggo,A powerhouse of acting,10,3 May 2007,"It has been two weeks since I saw this film and it's still with me. I don't think I've seen greater acting in a single film in my life.The adjective bank is empty when I try to describe David Thewlis's tour-de-force. It's just beyond description. It's not hyperbole in my opinion to say that this is one of the greatest performances in the HISTORY of film. Not just in the 1990s, but forever.Imagine my shock when I discovered that Thewlis wasn't even bloody nominated for an Academy Award! The winner in 1993 was Tom Hanks in 'Philadelphia' (a good performance, but that's all it was compared to Thewlis -- merely GOOD).If ever you've doubted the credibility and relevancy of the Academy Awards, look no further than this film.'Naked' is a brilliant example of Mike Leigh at the height of his power to shatter you. This was just an absolutely astonishing achievement in symbolizing the disintegration of western society, the utter desolation and detachment of humanity. Some of the set pieces in this film could have come out of an apocalyptic urban landscape, and it's hardly a cinematic accident. Leigh's dark vision of human alienation is on full display here.Thewlis's Johnny is the post-modern Ulysses -- he's out to find himself, to find meaning, to find SOMETHING. It is a lovely metaphorical work by Leigh, where he underlines again the frustrating experience of being alive and being plagued with the capacity to think. The characters in this film are familiar to the readers of Camus, Kafka, Dostoyevsky and many other great literary artists (Joyce included) -- we are doomed to search for that which we can never find.This film is worth seeing if only to watch some of the greatest acting you'll ever see in your life.",Naked

I liked the character performed by David Thewlis he done the role surprisingly good , you will keep wondering whether he's looking for answers or he's got all the answers but he's in pain of the ignorant people surrounding him there're many scientific/philosophical topics opened in the movie some of them which you may consider as fallacies but somewhat the scripts are brilliant still, if you're looking for weird ,thought provoking , full of arbitrary dialogues kind of movies sir! ,then you go watch this movie if you may .",Naked

Thewlis' character was obnoxious and self important...his meanderings grated on my nerves to the point when I was glad to see him get the boot only to make him shut up.

49,ill_behavior,"Dark. moody, brilliant",9,24 November 2002,"Okay, you can't measure one kind of genius against another, this is not an action movie (seven samurai), this is not a love story (insert classic film title here), this IS a slap in the face.Don't know whether the dialogue is mainly improvised or not, it has that feel, but I suspect it was written by Leigh just because Thewlis is a world-class actor. Ranting in movies is never better than here.The film is nasty, dialogue, violence, sex scenes, everything is explicit, and even though it goes to extremes, this works to its favour in that the film never seems to go anywhere. Its not a fable, in fact, the only things I can list are the things it isn't, because you couldn't pin it down. The London you see here is a world away from the Union flag waving mongoloids who clog up our screens every time something happens which makes the world look at the capital. Prostitutes, thugs, psycho's, the underworld is rarely portrayed with such uncharacteristic brutality. The sex scenes are rough, and the moral seems to be something along the lines of ""there is no future, and the rich always f*ck the poor, literally and metaphorically"".If you watch this film, you will either love it or detest it, I can understand that, it will get a reaction no matter what. I used to think I was quite open minded before I saw it, it made me realise the world is very big, and I am so small I may not matter to anyone.

Rented it again somewhat 6 months later and I began to see the uniqueness of this film. Embarrassingly, the first viewing, I didn't even know that was David Thewlis. That proves how in character he was. This movie is really good, but it is not for everyone. Another actor I highly praise in this film is ewen Bremner. He doesn't play big roles, but he IS a really good actor. Overall, if you like thought provoking films and hate those main stream films, this is the one not to miss. I give this a big 8.3/10, alongside my 8.4 Red Violin.",Naked
51,ellkew,Does it get any better than this?,10,3 July 2007,"This is the closest film I have ever watched that creates such a strong sense of atmosphere that I can almost taste it. I am not fond of Secrets and Lies or the caricatured types that inhabit many other of the director's films but here there seems little to laugh at but I am transfixed. It is not without its humour. Johnny has some great one liners some of which are throwaway snatches of brilliance 'Pizza delivery man', but he spits them out venomously, contemptuously, seething at the drabness of the world around him that can't compete with his intellect. Searching for something better. A parallel place. The scene where he erupts, a ball of tension and explodes at the top of the landing is almost unbearable in its intensity. The lingering shots of the characters are ghostly and unforgettable. Gina McKee as the drab almost gray woman who asks him if he wants beans, is such a sorry damaged character yet very real. I can imagine meeting her. Leigh lifts the lid and allows us to peer into the loneliness of the human condition and it is not a comfortable place to venture. The older woman's expression when Johnny says that line to her that any woman of her age dreads, well, I challenge any actor to deliver a finer reaction. This film has a cinematic feel to it which most of Leigh's other films don't. It's a searing view of Britain. I can't really put my finger on why it should work as there is not a great plot and it's all set in a drab student type house but it blows me away every time I watch it and it gets better each time. Thewlis is beyond anything I have seen in cinema for years, really outstanding, as are all the performances. The ending is wonderful. It's a perfect film. One of the best ever.",Naked

It's a hard film to watch, but I would love to see it again just to hear Thewlis' marvelous bitter rants and Ewen Bremner yelling ""Maggie!"".",Naked
53,DesbUK,David Thewlis delivers a tour de force performance that will always stay with you.,7,10 March 2009,"Now available on DVD in the UK for the first time, it's worth revisiting Mike Leigh's 4th cinema feature, 'Naked'. Originally released in the autumn of 1993, it won the Best Director and Best Actor prizes at that year's Cannes Film Festival. If Leigh's newest film 'Happy Go Lucky' is of a sunny and optimistic disposition, then 'Naked' is a far bleaker, inhumane and unsympathetic appraisal of London life in the drab and economically depressed early 1990s. It's a film of dialogue and characters - there's no plot. 'Low Expectations' might be an alternative title. Set over a period of just three days, 'Naked' has at its heart a compelling performance by David Thewlis as Johnny, a Mancunian drifter first seen having unsavoury sex with a unsavoury woman in a Manchester back alley. He flees the scene, steals a car and drives South to London to begin an odyssey through Dick Pope's darkly photographed nighttime streets and a depressed and colourless wintry London.Johnny colludes with no one and belongs to nowhere. He evokes no sympathy but is also not unlikeable. He is always unwashed, unshaven and untidy Only 27, he is also in the process of physical degeneration. But Johnny is no uncouth yob or waster, but a firestorm of intellect driven by the Bible and the prophecies of Nostradamus. Between scrounged bites of food, this is his existence.Johnny arrives on the doorstep of the flat of his former lover Louise (Lesley Sharp) and her doped up friend Sophie (Katrin Cartlidge). Johnny and Sophie share a cigarette, a joint and then have brutal sex on the sofa. Johnny leaves the flat and wanders through the night, first encountering two homeless Scots, then Brian (Peter Wright), a lonely security guard guarding an empty office block. Together the two men wander through the building in a spellbinding set piece of that is dazzlingly delivered by Thewlis at breakneck speed as he rants about the inevitable apocalypse in 1999 and how humanity will evolve from it's present state: ""The end of the world is nigh, Bri""Johnny is deeper and more talkative than anyone else. He subsequently encounters a drunken prostitute and a dim girl (Gina McKee). He is then twice beaten up: once in an alley by youths and once by a fly poster. Beaten and bleeding, he returns to Louise's flat only to discover Jeremy (Greg Cutwell) has taken up residence. He is the Yuppie landlord, something in the city and an excruciating caricature. Jeremy is a habitual misogynist, first seen asking a masseur if women enjoy being raped. He also rapes Sophie, making her wear a nurse's uniform in the process.At the flat, Johnny has an epileptic fit and regresses back to his abused childhood. Louise threatens to castrate Jeremy with a knife, and has a reconciliation with Johnny. But Johnny does not hang around and is last seen limping off at great speed with £290 of Jeremy's money (which had paid for Sophie's pleasure) in his pocket.'Naked' is visually and verbally about the abuse of women and a general overview of the intellectual themes of the late 20th century. Women in the film exist mostly to be put upon, whilst Johnny may look like the lowest of the lie, he rises above the rabble with a profound sense of the bigger picture. When Louise asks where he came from, he responds with a rapid fire description of the Big Bang theory. When she asks if he's bored, he then delivers a powerful speech about the problem with people is that they're always so bored - they've had the universe, nature and the living body explained to them and they're bored with it, so what they want now is just cheap thrills and plenty of them.I kept wondering if the film were made today what would be the targets of Johnny's intellect? Celebrity culture, the war on terror, political spin, reality TV? The film is certainly over long and two episodes (the drunken prostitute and the girl in the café) could have been jettisoned without loosing anything. Thewlis, however, delivers a once in a lifetime performance that stays with the viewer long after - and I mean years after - the film has finished.",Naked
54,Bon_Jovi_chick,I must be the only women on here who likes this film! SPOILERS FOLLOW!,9,23 December 2004,"Okay, every review has a brief outline on what happens and here it is:Johnny (David Thewlis) flees Manchester for London, to avoid a beating from the family of a girl he has raped. There he finds an old girlfriend (Lesley Sharpe), and spends some time homeless, spending much of his time ranting at strangers, and meeting characters in plights very much like his own.That's basically it in a nutshell. Doesn't sound like much, does it? Oh you would be surprised! Johnny rants a hell of a lot but most of it is very provoking, especially when it comes to the Bible. But if you cant understand the Manchester accent or the English lingo, you're not going to enjoy this because you wont understand half of what is being said or half of what is going on!This film is not for everyone. There is no basic plot to it which is basically Mike Leigh's style and I was asking myself repeatedly: Where is this story going?Despite this, it is very funny. It is mainly dark humour but Johnny shows off a mixture of sarcasm, intelligence and dark humour. In the first 10 minutes, I couldn't stop laughing at his wit (even though I don't think it was meant to be THAT funny!)However, it's also very sexually explicit. There are a lot of several rape scenes and the consensual scenes include Johnny treating his women roughly. This blurs the reality of what is rough consensual sex and rape. Johnny is a confused person and David Thewlis carried this off brilliantly! It is his best role bar non. He acts the way he does because that's the way he was brought up. Johnny is a genius and has his say for the world but form the way he was treated (probably by his mother), he's given up on life and the world and gets by being sarcastic and bitter. However, he has a good heart and seems to have feelings for one person: his girlfriend, the one person who he doesn't try to mess around with (physically or mentally in the film!) Some people are confused because of Jeremy and what part he has to play. I think what Leigh was trying to do was try and make a contrast between him and Johnny. Whilst Johnny shows compassion, Jeremy has no heart at all. It does not justify Johnny's rape or rough consensual sex- it rather shows that there are nastier people in the world than Johnny. After reading reviews from IMDb.com I found that women tended to hate this film whilst men love it. I wont say that I loved it but it was a good film and a lovely controversial (and extremely thought-provoking one at that. Marks: 8/10",Naked
55,bjacob,Superb. A paradigm.,10,17 January 2020,"I haven't got much to add to the many articulate and gushy reviews already present on this site, if not that I have watched the dvd with Leigh's commentary, and I was surprised to learn how little in this movie was planned in advance, and how much instead grew organically through the contributions of the cast and endless improvisation. It was shot almost entirely in order; when most of the last part was complete, the crew took a week off whilst director and actors remained on set (the very Dalston house where Louise, Sophie and Sandra live) to decide how the film should end. And a good job they did, delivering one of the most powerful endings of the whole history of cinema.It's very much a film of and for the Generation X. Within my circle of friends we watched it and discussed it endlessly: what does the Jeremy / Sebastian character represent? Which kind of relationship does he exactly entertain with Sandra? Is Louise the only truly positive character in the movie? I know it by heart, yet it always gives me strong emotions: for example, I can't watch the scene of the drunken dancing lady, it's just too painful.
My love for it is also partly rooted in having lived through that era, and its rawness. I wonder how the young react to it now.I am not big on naturalistic / gritty movies, but this one is in a league of its own. I wouldn't be able to tell what it is about, apart from being a heart-rendering, dramatic expression of the complexity and contradictions of human nature.",Naked
56,Krustallos,Exhilaratingly Bleak (one spoiler),9,29 March 2004,"This is probably Mike Leigh's best film, largely because of David Thewlis who gives a performance of deNiro-esque intensity (and much greater articulacy). The character's energy and charisma combined with his nihilism is like nothing else I've seen in the cinema. The man is magnetic. His casual destruction of the nightwatchman's entire philosophy is like watching a car crash in slow motion.This is also one of the great London movies, I don't think anything else brings the nightmarish bleakness of London's street life to the screen in such a vivid and truthful way. It's raw and very very scary.A word about who wrote what. Mike Leigh ""devises"" his films with the actors in a way which few of those involved seem willing to discuss in detail, however the consensus view is that the dialogue and plot are arrived at through a process of structured improvisation over a long rehearsal period. So in answer to some of the other comments, I think we can assume that a lot of the stuff Johnny says comes out of Thewlis' own head.",Naked
57,ReadingFilm,You're standing in my sun,10,10 May 2019,"A modern day Diogenes. Then the parallel to an ancient Greek philosopher set in London early 90s seems right, as this embodiment of the stubborn unwieldy iconoclast who wars you in semantics. Just look at his phenotype; Leigh obsesses over his startling close-ups. He's completely numb in how he dismantles. Perhaps it's why he does it is to provoke others into teaching him about himself with comebacks of their own; he savors confronting as real living. ""Don't waste your life."" It's too late. He reacts to her surprise he's 27 with his grizzly appearance. He is constantly horrified by 'time.' The cinema in this is his loveability compared to his words. How the film contrasts him with the malicious sociopath is to make the distinction between the two. They are in fact brothers and different outcomes in pain. His obsession with religious iconography and prophecies anticipate the 21st century that will make this film mighty indeed. See how that man's faith was the future, holding a photo not of Jesus, but a shack completely away from civilization. Then different primitivism is salvation not Naked's A.I. future which would be much like his job: comfortable and standstill and hopeless. Evolution evolving as a paradox, as it inevitably leads to 'no evolution' being some collective retirement. On the other end of that though. Transhumanists know streamlining and AI fulfill every equation until every corner of the universe is woke. Then it's a paranoia of the individual and its consequence. That is not the dearth of society but the consequence of thriving. They are already in ruins against it, yet cannot hope to even put it into words. Yet they know. The posters, megadeath, therapy, reflect this all as scrambles of Jungian screaming. As modern day hieroglyphics. The film is the primitivism of individualism within the late-stage capitalism and transhumanist future--except lives have to be lived even as the -something- is brought in. A Generation X Jesus was my favorite remark. Exactly that!",Naked
58,Dadge,An existential nightmare,10,16 October 2001,"Not an easy watch, for two reasons: first, this is an uncosmeticized view of 90's England, with little light in the dark; and second, much of the dialogue is difficult for non-Brits to follow. It's easy to spot this is a Mike Leigh film: the gritty realism, working-class characters and improvisation; but it's certainly harder-hitting than the likes of 'Secrets and Lies' or 'Life is Sweet'. But I prefer it to those other films because they suffer from overstylized characterization. What made this one of the best (and most critically-acclaimed) films of the 90s was David Thewlis's bravura performance as Johnny. Johnny is the plot, really. He turns aimless wandering around nocturnal London into an artform, especially the surreal visit with the security guard. Being a fellow northerner, I can see echoes of myself in Johnny, which no doubt adds to the film's appeal for me. But I'd recommend it to any intelligent viewer, not least because of the contrast it throws up between nihilism and nothingarianism.",Naked

I have watched this movie after reaching the peak maturity & understanding of various subjects, but my notion of movie making and direction was totally shattered when I came across this Mike Leigh's bleak & dark film. The role played by David Thewlis is totally shocking but his acting is purely awesome. He fled to London from Manchester in search of sex and shelter. Though his uncaring and ruthless approach towards life may looks offensive but its pretty interesting. His character is a very good observant. He believes that world is going to end in some years. But exactly what he wants from the life is not clear. He just tries to go deep inside others with petty conversation and unworthy topics. There was a kind of uniqueness in his role in this movie. But more than this, his character is beyond all doubts unacceptable & hypothetical because there is always something or at least one thing in life that you are concerned about. Or it just implies that there is nothing in this world which inspires you, take the life as it comes to you. Society may declare you insane or defeated but how does it matter?

63,gink10,David Thewlis Filmography Project,10,22 September 2019,"Johnny = The Idiosyncratic CharacterPros: Obviously king of the list. Naked is a before and after in David's career, if it wasn't for this film we would never have met him, known him or maybe he wouldn't have become famous. This is not the story of a depressed vagabond, the film is deeper than you can see at first glance. Johnny is a man who runs away from Manchester for having raped a woman, as we get to know him we realize as the truth if he is exposed and naked in all aspects, he takes and fully backs the whole film, of course this is my favorite Mike Leigh film (I have seen others from his filmography but they don't have the same power as Naked) David is an actor with innate talent that I don't need to study at a prestigious drama school to show all his own gifts, on the contrary, he proved himself what he can do, his Cannes award is enough to prove his enormous ability, it seems that this one never cared to be nominated for the Oscars that year (I think he hates The Academy), it's just one more gross award, since Naked is a 100% Anti-Hollywood film, it's too much for the criteria handled by the jury. Johnny is an acid humorist, with an irresponsible personality that is mature but ultimately very cordial, he could use a lot of definitions/words to describe it, but its complexity is far away for a standard actor. David creates a powerful performance like no other!Cons: For me Naked is impeccable, but if I need to say something against him, I would say: 1) I would have liked to see more scenes in Sandra's apartment between Johnny, Louise, and Sophie, it would be interesting to see their interactions, especially Sophie getting jealous of Louise for Johnny! 2) The first time I saw Naked when you almost get to the end in the Johnny scene and Louise in the bathroom when she asks him to come back to Manchester for a moment I thought I would accept and the two would go together.... but knowing everything that happened before the movie I realized to myself that even though I wanted that I knew it would never happen in the end, a soft side of me makes me feel broken because Johnny/Louise didn't have his happy ending... but my honest side knows that he will never change (because maybe not even the best person will change his mentality or behavior so easily), Naked is a movie with a realistic ending that ends as it begins... depressing and austere.Curious fact:After years of friendship between David and Mike Leigh and that he participated in the short film The Short & the Curlies and Life is Sweet David himself asked Leigh to make a film especially for him, being the main character himself, and although it took a little time to fulfill that promise the result was undoubtedly the greatest success in David's career.My personal definition of Johnny's behavior:This is my own thought, but for me he is a person who has experienced things that have affected mentally and emotionally, Johnny is not the smartest guy but he learns only to survive in a big world because it shows that he has been reflecting bad experiences in life, he gets to a point where he doesn't care if he does wrong and improper actions on other people. his sexual morbidity is, in my opinion, a way in which he wants to avoid what lives/occurs in his day today, and for me Johnny is a human who is afraid and centrally mistrusts a lot of other humans, he knows that the world is impure and with the passage of time all people are more tainted and corrupt that is why he lives without thinking about tomorrow, maybe he is sadistic but for me he needs to be eviler because the same life I teach him to have to be and he is not the worst person in the whole world.",Naked

People looked at me like I was from Mars. But when I saw what kind of scripts my classmates wrote I understood everything: nobody wants to be concerned with plot and character development, they just want to rant and rave and philosophize and do cool shots (which Naked has none of, btw). That said I do enjoy some of Thewlis's performances, as well as that of the rest of the cast, but there really is no overarching point to the film other than ""life sucks and then it ends"".

68,Robert_90,Amazing,9,21 January 2008,"I hadn't seen any of Leigh's prior work before deciding to settle on Naked as a good starter. From what I'd gathered beforehand, I knew I could expect something that could best be described as ""a gritty-feeling movie"". In hindsight, I don't think you can describe Naked as being ""a gritty-feeling movie"". You end up describing gritty-feeling movies as being ""like Naked"".That statement is pretty true  Naked is as bleak and unforgiving as they come. There are no good guys or any possible chances for redemption. Whenever a glimmer of hope appears during the film, it's obliterated within mere moments. The characters don't undergo any significant changes throughout the film. The film ends in pretty much the same way it begins, probably doomed to repetition until the end of the world. If you sit down to watch this, all I can say is ""be prepared"". Know what you're getting into.Although the unforgettable feel of the film could be attributed to its verité style (filmed on the dodgy side of London with very rough-looking film), it could be better attributed to the protagonist himself. David Thewlis gives what's probably his best performance as Johnny, a man with few strengths and countless flaws. His eloquent monologues are roughly balanced by his harsh treatment of others. Johnny has very little respect for anyone or anything and it shows as he inflicts pain (physical or emotional, it doesn't matter to him) on everybody that crosses his path.As bad as he is, however, he's oddly sympathetic in a way (especially when compared to a landlord who's as callous and sociopathic as he is, possibly more so). In a way, I could actually relate to Johnny (and not just because I have the same coat). He knows how bad he can be and acts accordingly, only because he doesn't believe in anything else or changing his ways. He just exists from day to day, just like any other human being. That's what makes Johnny so compelling  he really is only human. When karma finally catches up to him late in the film, we aren't glad to see him suffer. Johnny is the best kind of character, full of nuance that will make different people love him and hate him for the same reasons.Even though Naked depends heavily on Johnny's presence, he is not the be-all and end-all of the film. The supporting characters are exceptional  the stand-out roles being Johnny's ex and her flatmate. Watching them try and deal with the sudden arrival of both Johnny and (later on) the landlord is in itself one very compelling subplot. A runner-up would be the security guard on his graveyard shift who engages in a series of debates with Johnny about time, life, evolution and the inevitable Apocalypse.Needless to say, Naked was one hell of a film to watch. It makes me wonder exactly how I should rate it, if I should rate it. It's not really one of those movies where you just say ""Oh yeah, very good, very moving, 4 stars."" You're more likely to watch it and afterwards not say anything, just think about it. Those are the exceptional films, and Naked is definitely that  a dark, pessimistic insight into the mind of a human being who treads the fine line between self-destruction and utter dissatisfaction.",Naked
69,javold,The Emperor has no clothes,3,4 December 1999,"Naked gives viewers a diversity of characters, a string of subplots, witty banter, proletarian satire, philosophies of evolution and apocalypse, a running analogy to The Odyssey, shades of sexuality, and an overall mood of bleakness and cynicism. But when all is said and done, the movie is just too dark and hopeless to get excited about.  Fans of this film might say that I didn't get it, but I think I just got too much of the devil in the barcode commentary and ""bite me"" sex scenes.  Depressing.

I could witter on about the brilliance of David Thewlis' performance, the excellent support cast, the devastatingly witty dialogue and Leigh's assured direction until the cows came home, but this still wouldn't totally do it. I can't say a lot about the plot because, well, there isn't a great deal of plot to speak of. So what is it? I'll tell you what it is: it's the honesty of it. The brutal, searing, sickening honesty. Here is a film unafraid to hold a mirror up to the dark, venal, destructive underbelly of our society - a film that portrays relentlessly and unflinchingly a side of our character which we'd prefer to simply sweep under the carpet. It takes everything that is immoral, degenerate and depraved in modern society and smears it all over the screen in a grubby orgy of loathing. It is not simply a movie with teeth but one with rabid, venomous, acid-tipped fangs, tearing and gnashing at our pompous ideas about our own natures.There are many movies which are fantastically enjoyable and make for a sterling night out with friends and family.

But if you, like most high-profile movie reviewers, are easily impressed by simplistic nihilism, and need to feed your depression, this movie is a sumptuous feast. Yet, I admit I was somewhat impressed by the skill these actors demonstrated in taking this pointless adventure seriously. Also, I can't overlook a couple of invigorating scenes that break the dreariness.Truthfully, I think it would be impossible to SPOIL this movie, as it's famous for not having a plot, and being beyond conventional story-telling. That said, BE WARNED some of the rest might be considered a SPOILER!My favorite scene was Johnny's encounter with a laconic poster hanger and his reaction to the non-stop fatalistic rant.

I would advise you to watch alone if possible - not in a group setting - then you get more lost in the movie, i would suggest.The first thing i want to say is amazing achievement to the director/writer Mike Leigh and esp the main actor David Thewlis.These are both truly incredible and ground breaking performances and i have seen nothing as good as this before or since - in this style of film.I think a lot of this was improvised and i believe the short script was formulated during rehearsal.The opening scene is Johnny (Thewlis) 'raping'??? a woman in a dark dismal street and then fleeing from Manchester to avoid the dangerous brother of his victim.He steals a car and seeks out an old 'girlfriend' in London to escape.Johnny then goes on an brief but insane adventure/odyssey- during which time he interacts with various characters some of whom seem as odd and desperate as himself.He seems to bully and exasperate the other characters by sheer intensity of will, superior intellect and a kind of mixture of spiritual insight, frustration and lust.Johnny unscrupulously takes advantage of the kindness/vulnerability/stupidity/desperation of others and never seems to fail to find a bed (complete with accommodating woman)to sleep in. He repays the kindness of others with mental and sexual bullying - and with utter contempt. The genius of the whole thing is that he is not just a bully - he really is a victim too from himself.There are times when Johnny really gets under your skin and you actually feel like punching him to shut him up. He does kind of get his comeuppance from a group of louts - but you are sad too, when this happens.Somehow you are secretly rooting for him as well as pitying and despising him.You love and loathe this guy in equal measure is my analysis.He seems like a caged animal and actually says one memorable line to the effect saying 'I used to be a werewolf- but i am alright nooowwwwwwww......' The 'now' tailing off into the howl of a werewolf.The adjectives i would use to explain this movie and the emotions i felt watching it are - funny, crazy, bizarre, sad, pathetic, confusing, sexual, annoying, violent, twisted, nonsensical and brilliant. Often you see/feel a combination of these at the same time as you get sucked into the mayhem and genius of what you are watching.There is much violence, sex and swearing throughout so just be warned - but it is done in a surreal way that does not offend me at all, but others more sensitive may be offended.This film is a total one off and streets ahead of anything similar i have seen.Attempting this movie really could have been a disaster but the genius of Thewlis and Leigh along with good and great performances from the other actors make this an absolute must see masterpiece.Please just see it for yourself - only then will you see what i am trying to describe.",Naked

What a shame that it lost its balance half way through and squandered it's potential.  What makes this film worth seeing are the incredible verbal histrionics of David Thewlis.  He imbues his character with such satiric and cynically scathing wit that he leaves the audience reeling from his machine-gun like existential rants against humanity.  Many of the early scenes are funny and mesmerizing thanks to him. The rest of the film unfortunately does not fare as well.  It is somewhere shortly after Thewlis' scene with the night watchman that the movie begins to lose its momentum, but it is the last third of the film which truly drags thanks to Director Mike Leigh's unfortunate decision to concentrate too much on the character of the deviant landlord.  This character was not only one dimensional and uninteresting but totally unnecessary.  His arrival throws the film's mood and energy way off.David Thewlis gets a 10.

The first time it is watched it leaves you feeling a bit confused, a bit depressed and glad that you can shrug it off with ""its only a film"". I've watched it about 10 times now over the years as I've shown it to others, just as it was shown to me by another 'fan'. The thing that makes it so good is just that its a ****ing brilliant film, its what films should be, highly entertaining, thought provoking and capturing the moment in time when it was made.

Painfully overacted, especially by the nurse, but in general the endless speeches of David Thewlis reveal themselves to not be driving at anything in particular. The movie seems a self conscious attempt to show how much angst they can pack into a painfully slow two hours. If you can keep up with how fast Thewlis is talking you will realize that everything he says is only pseudo-intellectual trite word play. The fascination with rape and the scrawny posh psychopath are never shown to have any meaning, and there is hardly any plot to speak of. All of the female characters are an insult to women everywhere, as they fawn obsessively over a grimy tramp, and go on the occasional emotional tirade.

81,slavabregovic,A refreshing punch in the face,8,19 July 2019,"This still stands as one of my favourite films that I really don't want to revisit too often, nor is it a movie that I'd recommend to lots of people. Harsh, would be an apt description, but that's far too simple. If anything, this is a very sharp exploration of both darkness and light, freedom and free-fall, power and powerlessness; the lack and then abundance of, nuance.That being said, it's a rambling, twisted jaunt through some of the darkest aspects of 'your average person'. While it's a slow burn, it's a searing, painful and stark jab contrasted with scatterings of dark humor, parody and self-deprecation.
With an eerily powerful ease, Thewlis introduces our...ultimate anti-hero of sorts, Johnny. Johnny is an aimless fvck-up with a confusing, manic energy driven by what seems to be a volatile mix of hopelessness and a deranged sense of...adventure? an open mind? It's hard to describe, but you know it when you see it. Tangled alongside Johnny are his ex-girlfriend Louise (Lesley Sharp), a dry, somewhat bitter woman, and her friend Sophie, a charmingly frustrating gal, both of whom have the misfortune of becoming ensnared in Johnny's twisted unraveling. Then there's Louise's landlord, a man with a smooth, slick veneer that seems to just barely cover the foul grime within, enough to draw in the pretty Gisele.
We spend what seems to be an exceedingly long night with a cracked-out, somewhat manic Johnny as he roams London, having left his hometown of Manchester, apparently (or maybe subconsciously) looking for 'something' that he just can't seem to find, whether in his head or in the bleak reality of his existence. This segment of the movie is rather slow, but again, it's a closely condensed representation of how such a night would unfold in real life. Johnny meets some rather 'colourful' characters during his jaunt, yet said colours are muted and rather marred by a thick cloud of intense nihilism. Yet, nihilism with a sense of wonder. There's a dizzying contrast between smash-in-the-face bluntness, and poignant subtleties. A sense of pointlessness, yet Johnny makes various interesting 'points' throughout his ramblings and musings. A common thread throughout his journey: the paradox of many truths. Something (i think) is especially relevant today as it was then--- that things are varying greys, never just black and white. Johnny is a scumbag, but also an intellectual. Sophie, a strong, free-spirited person, but also, a person susceptible and somewhat caged by misogyny and naivety. And so on, with all the people we encounter, there are many contrasts, truths, presumptions and revelations.This film relies heavily on very loosely-scripted acting, which presents a series of sharp and often uncomfortably realistic scenarios. No aspect of human ugliness is spared when the focus is something inherently ugly. Each shot feels quite voyeuristic, as if you're along for a ride with each character introduced. This is a dark trip, for sure, with some...almost shockingly 'touching' moments on the way. In particular, the conversation with a bored security guard, and an interaction with a sad, lonely women up late alone in her apartment. Also worth mentioning is a jangly, amusing, fleeting little interaction with a homeless man (Ewan Bremner and his wonderful accent).Here we could've easily fallen into an all-too-often seen trap of gratuitous violence and glorified rape, when instead, it presents us with both subjects (and so much more) that forces the viewer to both confront and be confronted. I especially appreciated the realism offered by the way this film is actually shot. When Louise wakes up, she looks the way we all do when we first wake up after a restless night, disheveled and tired, without overdone makeup tricks or lighting. The characters appear as we see people in everyday light, this is no noir film. Had it been created more recently, I think many people would be quick to write it off (along with the director himself), pre-emptively being offended by the difficult subject matter it explores. However, I think it's certainly worth a watch, most especially because the direction in no way glorifies the darkness, the wrongness at hand--- there's no fetishistic aspect (I'm side-eyeing you, Lars von Trier). It isn't as if the director is going over the top to shock us, or getting off on presenting these tortured stories. It's a brash dive into territory that feels both dreadfully familiar yet what many of us obtusely insist is very distant. And that, right there, is exactly why I liked this film so much.All that said, we have an excellent cast delivering stellar performances. I would have given it a 10 rating, but I knocked off a few points: I didn't care for the music, I felt it was too melodramatic and ""movie-like"". There's several scenes where it seems very out of place to the point I found it memorably annoying. That, and Gisele's character seems flat and underdeveloped, when the film is so long it seems they could've given her a bit more substance. Those little nit-picks aside, I feel like this would be a great movie for a film student to learn from. It's also much like a book come to life. Not for the easily bored or offended, but fantastic if you want to see something very different that leaves one with a lot to think about.",Naked
82,No_Miss,And the Omelet Stinks,9,11 June 2005,"""You can't make an omelet without cracking a few eggs. And humanity is just a cracked egg. And the omelet stinks,"" a quote from Johnny (played by David Thewlis). Where do I begin? The film's lack of plot, hypnotic score and dialog took me to an ""unfamiliar place"". Major themes include attitudes towards work, urban decay, human relationships, biology, evolution, sexual brutality, and prophecies about the end of the world. The movie follows a drifter named Johnny as he encounters various working class people for roughly 24 hours. What makes the movie great is the witty dialog. For example when asked about how he got here Johnny replies, ""Well, basically, there was this little dot, right? And the dot went bang and the bang expanded. Energy formed into matter, matter cooled, matter lived, the amoeba to fish, to fish to fowl, to fowl to frog, to frog to mammal, the mammal to monkey, to monkey to man, amo amas amat, quid pro quo, memento mori, ad infinitum, sprinkle on a little bit of grated cheese and leave under the grill till Doomsday.""

85,reachtitan,A dystopian nightmare,9,3 May 2013,"Finally watched it. Mike Leigh's ""Naked"" is one of the most thematically disturbing and haunting movies you will ever come across. It tells the story of Johnny(Thewlis), a philosophical,world-weary drifter who is always on the run from the law.After committing a rape in Manchester, he lams to London to live at his former girlfriend's residence. Thereon, he again embarks on a surreal odyssey on the London streets meeting people as queer as himself. From answering questions as deeply rooted in theology and metaphysics;spitting out doomsday prophecies as some boardroom lecture to satisfying needs as banal as a hot-water bath and some sex, Johnny does it all here, on this trip.Director Leigh extracts performances verging on the edge of perfection from the entire cast and does so with superb improvisation which is quite evident,especially, in scenes that feature Johnny. Everyone is a knockout in the acting department, but,hey;then there is David Thewlis as Johnny.He delivers a portrayal that has shades of Hamlet,Jimmy Porter,even Jesus(a very sado-masochistic and cruel one at that). I say Jesus paradoxically because in a way Johnny wants to save mankind from the ignorance of believing we are not doomed and affirming that God has manipulated us(mankind) for the sake of some cosmic warfare. It is indeed a cynical and paradoxical second coming of Christ. Thewlis gave his 'naked' body and soul to this film by devouring almost every book about religion and eschatology as a part of role-preparation. he evokes time to time disgust,pity.hatred and wonder in his hauntingly mesmerizing performance.If you are looking for plot, there isn't any. Most of the film revolves around Johnny and his adventures. Fraught with existential overtones,it is a thunderous take by Leigh on the Thatcherite England which almost convinces viewers that it is a dystopian world we are living in; that apocalypse isn't far and we need something or somebody to awaken us from this nightmare.",Naked
86,filmophile90,This Movie is Something Else...,9,6 September 2018,"Naked brings a lot on the table for you to digest. Conspiracy theories, astronomy, astrology, re-defining the concept of time: the past, the present, the future. And if you don't understand everything in it, you shouldn't be surprised. I sure didn't. It's bold, unpleasant and uniquely funny of which the latter makes it way more palatable. Sometimes it becomes a bit too theatrical in stylistic terms, but that's also one of its strengths. A lot of the scenes were filmed in one take, while Thewlis relentlessly runs his aggressive motor-mouth as an intellectual drifter imposing his theories, philosophies and will upon total strangers. The characters are very convincing, the script is wonderful and acting is top tier. Especially Thewlis' performance is unparalleled, hence the Cannes win for Best Actor, well deserved. There's just one confusing and seemingly rushed side-story about another man in his early 30s or so that didn't really add much depth to the film other than sadistically humorous scenes. So while Naked is not a flawless film, it sure is close. Having seen Good Will Hunting, it has a similar theme, but a darker tone and at least one same message: don't waste your life.",Naked
87,Namron7,Whining nonsense,1,6 November 2010,"Complete rubbish.For a start, Johnny wouldn't have lasted one day back in 90's London done up as he was.

And what's with the voyeurism? Er,.....Mike? Fourthly, WTF is going on with the ending? My guess - based on his previous form: Johnny hops to the nearest phonebox to drink a bottle of vodka, pleasure himself over the phone-book, beat his head bloody against the door jamb, and collapse in a pool of vomit - all the while reading the Schrodinger equation aloud in a whining northern accent.I really wish that had been the ending! And that then a steamroller - piloted by the security guard tersely singing 'Any Old Iron' in a monotone - had very slowly crushed said phonebox flat with Johnny inside, accompanied by his screams, imprecations, philosophical incantations and begging. Johnny's last words would be 'Tetley Tea Folk...Marquis de Sade...'.Seriously, just because it was 'cough, cough' a bit different, doesn't mean this film was great.Please grow up, everyone.Sigh.",Naked
88,brenjamesuk,"Realism, or caricature?",4,28 March 2012,"A weird film! The good bit is David Thewlis' Existential p**s-taking discourse with everyone he comes across - the bad bit is - everything else. Also, it's way too long. The charm had worn off. Ends up being long-winded and pointless - whereas had it been shorter it would have been bitter-sweetly succinct. Johnny, is the archetypal street philosopher, though instead of being a wise vagabond - he is in fact an on the run vagrant - on the run from life, that is. Also - who the f**k is Sebastian?All of that aside though, I have a real problem with Mike Leigh's films. He tries TOO hard to come across as authentic and real - and this effort becomes so conspicuous that it clouds everything else and it's all you can see. His films aren't authentic and real - they're the opposite of that - they're overdone and contrived. Most of his stuff ends up being a bunch of middle-class loveys performing their perception of an Idyll of plucky, chirpy, working-class folk! I suspect that the only thing that saves this film from becoming that, is the intensive involvement of Thewlis in developing the script and dialogue.Basically Leigh's approach in depicting authentic realistic working class characters, ends up producing a facsimile that is strikingly recognisable to the original article - but one that exaggerates the more obvious features - to a cringe-making degree. He creates cinematic caricatures.",Naked

No matter where I began to watch it, I was riveted. David Thewlis is simply mesmerizing. Despite the existential angst and relentless nihilism, I could not turn my head away. Although Thewlis' character is completely disagreeable, one cannot help from feeling compassion for this lost soul as he stumbles through his miserable hopeless state. I also found myself laughing out loud at his clever, sometimes merciless, retorts and comments. It reminded me of The Theatre of the Absurd as per jean Paul Sartre or Eugene Ionesco. The supporting cast is superb as well. I would recommend this movie to anyone I know who is interested in depth in cinema and acting. Utterly brilliant work!",Naked

Eerily enough, throughout watching this 1993 British film, I constantly had the feeling that I had already viewed this film.To end, Samuel Beckett's quote: 'I can't go on, I must go on' - while being a quote that may very well be overused by my subconscious - came to mind throughout viewing this film.",Naked

94,furiousgeorge87,Aggressive Existentialism,10,30 January 2003,"Naked provides a large dose of pop philosophy through a twisted medium.  Its lead, Johnny, is the kind of person you would feel sorry for and avoid on the street.  Yet you still listen to him and find him moving, almost hypnotic. There were times when he is making perfect sense to you, but then you realize that he is ranting about ""666"" and the apocalypse. His nihilistic/existential view are disconcerting to the conservative and liberal alike.Philosophical aspects aside, the mise en scene and general atmosphere is spectacular.  The coldness of Britain in what I assume is the fall or winter is perfect for what Leigh intends.  Naked is not a movie that could be shot in Southern California.  Even in the scenes of hope, there is that background feeling of the cold that sometimes even detracts from the moment.A good way to sum this up is A Clockwork Orange with as many rapes, less violence, and more philosophy.

If you really want to watch something good on middle-class, existentialism etc. try Bergman, Haneke or someone from their class. At least they still have hope for the humanity. I just don't understand why people who don't believe in the future for humanity make films about it. If there is no future, why do you bother yourself with making films to tell it. Just go to park and lay down under the sun with the biggest secret of the history. And enjoy it. I never expected it but Leigh is a new Von Trier for me. Another big disappointment.

Something to avoid when making a film - characters blabbering senseless, overwrought, convoluted monologues on screen that are ultimately trite and unconvincing. If the film is an attempt at social realism, these verbal barrages are so over-the-top that they actually draw attention to the film constructed as film and effectively neutralize that intent. Is it the acting, or the script that is bad, or both?The protagonist is also highly unbelievable for social realism - ravenously consuming canonical English literature and the bible while high or hungover and able to produce such profoundly sophomoric soliloquies while intoxicated? And how is such an unattractive, unwashed and verbally noxious character able to bed most of the women he meets within minutes of encountering them? (I had to applaud when one chick finally threw him out onto the street, despite his whining and self-pitying banter).The viewer encounters pretentious references to Ancient Greek literature, Nostradamus and the Book of Revelations. The impending doom of mankind, in the form of bar codes imprinted on our foreheads or right hands in spooky biblical fashion, is presented to a character who is oh-so-cleverly exposed in his role as a guardian of empty space. This flick is over-scripted and over the top - a melodrama clumsily infused with pedestrian ""philosophy"" about the meaning of mankind, life, etc. It is trite, overwrought and tedious.There are some very fine English films available with content similar to this film. ""Nil by Mouth"" is an excellent, far more interesting excursion into the lives of individuals in a similar social milieu. Ditto for ""In the Warzone.""

Instead we get a series of encounters with more cartoon characters for Thewliss to spout nonsense at.This film has a few plus points, it's certainly refreshing to see a different London from Richard Curtis's, however it also shows Leigh as falling too easily into the trap of whimsy - as Career Girls would a few years later.A much better film about London 'grifting' is Ken Loache's 'Riff Raff'.",Naked

This film is macabre, raw, and with dialogue as sharp as anything ever witnessed on celluloid. Mike Leigh created a dark brooding magnum opus with this portrait of early 90's London. His partnership with David Thewlis, who creates a fascinating and ribald character is simply astonishing. It is a performance that explores our very humanity. This film investigates the existential angst as portrayed by the protagonist Johnny of what is to survive; the main character gradually reveals himself before us stripped of pretence and standing ""naked"" . Johnny's diatribes tinged with apocalyptic tones upon the nature of the universe and beyond are breath taking. Sex and violence under pin the narrative of this film, and with Jonny adhering to no personal boundaries he embarks upon a journey that takes the viewer upon an uneasy and ultimately rewarding journey . The film is important as it shows the true power of the cinematic medium , and as a cultural reference to the pap produced by Hollywood; exposing the neutered offerings mainstream cinema is plagued with. This film shows Mike Leigh as a master of his art, expressed by the unique performances he elicits from his cast.

If I was to be hyper critical the only flaw is the director's views on class struggle are too obviously left wing politically (contradiction between realism with areas of subjectivity regarding politics). And the jeremy character has no redeeming features, which breaks the rule that all the other actors are well balanced their flaws and their qualities enhance the realism. One other criticism is that it is mysognistic (what man isnt even if at least subconciously we are getting into Freudian territory here lol), which is arguably true, Which is to say the only flaws in the film, are almost like a signature on a classical painting obscuring a nice vase base!

It tears your perspective on society apart, it shows you the highs and mostly lows of the sad broken people you see one the street everyday. In some sense we are all Johnny, the seeker who is always running away, and if you are even the least human you have felt the feelings or acted like most of the characters.The discussion between Johnny and the nightwatch(Brian), is in my humble opinion one of the greatest pieces of dialogs in a movie script. Mike Leigh has a special talent for telling the life story of a supporting character in 2-4 simple frames, like the young girl at the café(and if you rent Secrets & Lies, you will love the sequence with the former owner of Maurice's shop).David Thewlis performance as Johnny is just frightening, it should be the benchmark for acting for his generation.

It seems to the viewer that each character could be no worse off than he is... but the movie continues. Violent sex totally void of any decent emotion is proof of the complete lack of love of the main male roles in this movie. Sebastian, a psuedo-rich, sick and twisted (and wholly unexplained) character is a poster boy for American Psycho (BretEastonEllis) Each character touches another characters life in an unhealthy yet profound way.

Clearly, love it or hate it, this is a film that is uncomfortable to watch and gets under your skin - this is largely to its credit. It follows a few days in the life of Johnny, a violent, disaffected, philosophical and transient young man who flees a rape scene to his ex-girlfriend's flat in London, manipulating her and her roommate, and takes to the streets again to bully, lecture and tease a series of interesting Londoners. The dismal realism of the cold city nightscape Leigh has captured here emphasises the film's prevailing nihilistic tone. I very much appreciate a movie that eschews traditional plot, that tries instead to portray a 'slice of life.' I appreciate a movie that passes no moral judgment, delivers no retribution, features no absolutely good characters or suggests in its characters monumental change for the better in a matter of days, introduces people we find despicable and dares us to sympathies with them anyhow. Naked is very much anti-Hollywood, and ordinarily that puts a film well on its way to my list of favorites. But that in itself is not quite enough. The thing is this. To classify Johnny as a 'complex anti-hero' is inadequate and misguided at best. Call me a raving bitter feminist if you must, but I cannot find it in me to sympathies on any level with a character who is essentially a rapist. The film is deeply misogynistic, presenting all women as victims always and all men as rapists at worst and voyeurs at best. It is difficult to criticise the film on this level because it sounds like I'm demanding a healthy dose of morality or an indomitable heroine be injected into the story. It sounds like I'm saying no movie about sexual violence and victims ought to be taken seriously. But this stark portrayal of outwardly sexually confident women who are easily broken and outwardly philosophical men who are easily turned to violent sadism is irredeemably anti-women and doesn't do much for the image of men, either. Johnny is undeniably a complex, intriguing character, and Thewlis delivers what I would without hesitation hold up against the finest performances of all time. His long philosophical rants bring out what humanity is in him, showing him for the desperate human being searching for truth he really is rather than some erudite philosopher. The dialogue is sometimes fantastic but sometimes rather reminds me of conversations I had in the college dorm at 3 am on a Tuesday night - oh, we found ourselves tremendously clever at the time, but it's really just so much self-obsessed existential blather. All at once, I found myself delighting in Johnny's wit and laughing out loud at what struck me as 'babble babble babble, you with me?'All things considered, it is a good film, a very bleak and philosophical look at human frailty and violence, and interesting for its improvised feel. Not for everybody, but highly recommended for any fan of Thewlis', independent film-making and existentialist philosophy. But I think it's a film you respect more than like.",Naked

I did appreciate the score, and the witticisms voiced by Thewlis'' Johnnie character. Overall, there's just a hodgepodge masquerading as content, onto which any viewer can project profundity wherever they wish. I, for instance, was able to muster up a soupçon of sympathy for some of these characters, repellent as they are, but I think that has more to do with my temperament than it does with Leigh's skills as writer/director.",Naked
114,omer-oushia,a groups of characters collide in a the bitter reality of hyper realist London,9,26 April 2012,"The title of Mike Leigh's film ""naked"" does not describe a physical state but a state of mentality that the characters of the film face. These people have no jobs, no relationships, no families, and barely have an existence in a hyper realistic anarchy- a dark and bitter world created by the brilliant British director: mike Leigh. The film is set in a deeply depressing London. The characters we meet are so desperate and this is a desperate film. The hero is Jonnie, a 27 year old man who struggles to exist in the world he lives in. his desperation is one of the most devastating depictions of devastation I have ever seen on film. We first see him raping a woman and then stealing a car. What a brutal introduction to one of the most brutal relationships of an audience with a main character. The series of events the follow are mesmerizing. Every turn Jonnie takes, he meets a character who faces desperation much like his own. The film's plot progresses to a melting pot of desperate, psychopath and devastating characters. This film is a masterpiece. It features one of the most heartbreaking performances of all time by the brilliant actor: David Thewlis. Another performance I won't ever forget was from Katrin Cartilidge playing the character of Sophie. Her existence on screen is so weak yet so strong, her fragility is fascinating. Mike Leigh creates a world so bitter and sad in order to create cinematic poetry. This film's philosophic takes on life and humanity are so bleak, bold and honest. Hearing these takes is like getting punched in the stomach. This film had such a deep effect on me. I had trouble completing my day. It is nightmarish, bold, dark, devastating and ultimately, masterful.",Naked
115,wheelz04,Absolutely Horrible,1,15 August 2005,"After reading other user comments raving about how brilliant this film is, I realize I am in the minority for having absolutely hated it.But people seem to think that if a film contains unsympathetic characters, difficult subject matter, and an unconventional style of storytelling, then it must be a work of true genius. I couldn't agree less.My wife and I sat through about 40 minutes and she couldn't watch any more. I later went back and finished watching myself to see if it got any better, but alas, it did not. This movie is a self-important piece of garbage full of completely unlikable characters and uncomfortable situations with no emotional payoffs. Johnny is not nearly as smart as he thinks he is, and that also goes for the film itself.Don't be fooled.",Naked
116,pjcroad,One of the worst films ever.,1,6 August 2005,"I started watching this film, and at first couldn't finish it. I was already having a really bad day, and this film made it SO much worse. Basically the story is Johnny is a misfit who rapes a girl. That sickened me, but what was worse was the fact that the producer (Mike Leigh) decided Johnny should be the star of the show. So as if having a rapist as the star of a show isn't bad enough (and therefore implying rape is O.K. in certain circumstances, when in actual fact it of course never is), Mike Leigh decides to add a second rapists just for the fun of it. I was so angry at this movie and its director. Please do NOT watch this film, especially if you have experienced any kind of sexual violence.",Naked
117,bex_purple,Naked Owns Cinema.,10,25 May 2006,"My favourite film of all time and I don't even know why. It not only is repulsive but at the same time hysterically funny. It makes living in London a distorted pleasure as it is on my mind every day as I walk through the city that inspired such a piece. The theories that Johnny comes up with are not only salient but increasingly prophetic and it serves as a reminder to Mike Leighs brilliance that a film ORIGINALLY intended as a Post Thatcherite comment can now be seen as a highly accurate portrait of 21st century Britain. The dialogue is razor sharp and the thoughts and ideas explored may be too 'In Your Face' for some but it is a film that every adult should see. It makes you face what you are and that may make it an uncomfortable experience but the result is, for good or ill, life changing. For that, it is, to me the greatest film of all time.aonemantidalwave",Naked
118,danielflattery,A Sinister and Mesmerising Film,10,26 March 2018,"Mike Leigh has often been called a proponent of Social Realism and yet Naked, as his most unique and striking work, escapes this category. The constancy of the monochromatic darkness that surrounds Leigh's nocturnal oddysey is highly surreal and distinctly memorable, appearing to represent a futile search for intelligent company by protagonist, 'Johnny', who is played by David Thewliss. Almost every scene in 'Naked' is shot in dim lighting and generally with only one visible source of light. This helps to cast shadow and leaves whole areas of the scene totally black and, combined with exclusively low angle shots, leaves the impression that we are witnessing something of society's darkened underbelly.It is interesting that the one instance where Leigh opts for a bright, open setting is the scene where Johnny finds solace in the company of an optimistic and philosophically minded night watchman, with whom he jousts verbally. The well lit reception area in which the guard works seems to represent salvation for Johnny. Soon after however, the scene plunges back to darkness, culminating with the two hunched on a stairwell, Johnny appearing to have corrupted the nature of his companion. Johnny later refers to him as an 'insecurity guard'.Leigh's approach towards actors is somewhat revolutionary and Naked is no exception in this regard, with Leigh directing the cast to improvise extensively and formulating the script from the results. This approach leads to a naturalism or nakedness that is seldomly surpassed. The script is dynamic and totally unpredictable. Thewliss was directed to read the bible and the teachings of Buddhism as research for the role and frequently quotes from both, creating a haunting contrast with his character's overt atheism.The camera work features many long, tracking shots, the most impressive of which is the final shot of Thewliss, limping down the street after having stolen a wad of money from his newly reconciled girlfriend. Throughout the shot's minute and a half, the camera remains just in front of Thewliss, looking backwards at his slow progress. The camera here deliberately avoids the road ahead and is very striking for that reason, seeming to suggest the difficult and uncertain path that lies ahead for both Johnny and the society he inhabits.",Naked
119,kobbunb,Naked Review,6,8 November 2017,"Just overrated. There is nothing more than irrelevant aphorisms. Actually, there are more. David Thewlis's perform is really good and the scenario is okay but it's not awesome as much as people say it is. I'd rate it maybe more than 7 but my expectation was so high because of the people who talk about this movie.",Naked
120,thealighierian,Like a perfectly made box.,10,20 March 2008,"Although it's several years after this film's release, I have to echo the sentiments of the other 10/10 reviewers. However, there was a bit of this film that I found to be a special treat for those interested in Nihilism in film.This is the first film I've seen where Christian Nihilism was so well conveyed. I've seen bits of it in other films done well (as well as some grossly failed attempts) but this one really showed the line of reasoning (via perfectly entertaining dialog) leading and the way it manifests in the main character's life. I can't believe how skillfully Leigh was able to make these characters so utterly wretched yet still totally sympathetic (well, most of em).Naked is a bleak but delicious treat.",Naked
